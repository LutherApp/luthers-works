Foreword. 


The present 22nd volume of our revised edition of Luther's works according to J. G. Walch has been edited by Professor Hoppe, who has been appointed since last fall to edit this edition of our Luther edition. He has made special studies on Luther's table talks for a number of years and has published the results in this volume. What distinguishes this latest edition of Luther's Table Talks from all the earlier ones, he himself has stated in the introduction. We have no doubt that with this thorough and careful work he will earn the gratitude not only of all Luther readers, but also of Luther scholars. 

Luther's Table Talks have never had the same prestige in the Lutheran Church as 


St. Louis, John 1887. 


Luther's other writings, precisely because they were not written by him, but by his table companions. However, the fact that it cannot be determined exactly how Luther spoke in detail does not negate the value of these records. After all, Luther's Hauspostille is the most widespread of his books, although even there Luther's words are conveyed to us through the pen of his household friends. Thus, Luther's Table Talks, as they are presented here, well examined and reviewed, are warmly recommended to the Lutheran Whoever contemplates them carefully will find in them 


Christian people! reads and a short, pithy summary of Luther's teachings and will be encouraged in the recognition of 


the salutary truth.

Introduction. 


Luther once expresses the wish,*) that he could have been present only one time at the most lovely company of the Lord JEsu with his disciples, in order to enjoy it. A similar wish is close to every Evangelical- Lutheran Christian: If only | could have spent one evening with our dear father D. Martin Luther, the greatest man and hero of faith after the time of the apostles! This wish, my dear reader, can and will be abundantly fulfilled, yes, for days and weeks, by what is offered in this volume. It brings you for the first time Luther's Table Talks translated from the originals. Our edition is the best and most complete of all editions published so far. The most complete, because we have recently brought to light the main sources of the Table Talks, the diaries of Lauterbach about the year 1538 and of Cordatus from the year 1537, trusted friends and table companions of Luther, in a completely unabridged German translation; the best, because we have eliminated from the Table Talks much that does not belong to them, partly duplicates, partly borrowed from other writings of Luther, partly not originating from Luther, but have renewed a large part of the Table Talks from these two main sources. Both men have copied what Luther said from his own mouth, at his table and elsewhere. 

The importance and value of the discovery of these two diaries cannot be overestimated. For in the case of the table talks he

The result is not merely a correction of individual readings or improvement of details, but really a complete transformation and renewal of the previous table talks. The editions of the Table Talks are without exception, corrupted to a degree never imagined, so that it was almost impossible for us to retain and improve the old translation, even for the least corrupted pieces, but it had to be thrown aside and replaced by a new one. In the case of a few pieces, we tried to limit ourselves to an improvement at the beginning of our work, but what was improved in this way provided an almost inextricable print template. It will be easy to believe that it was not without significant reason that we decided to retranslate 1411 numbers of the Tischreden, namely 1031 from Cordatus and 356 even more extensive ones from Lauterbach, and 24 from Kummer. 

This new translation has been done not only because of the unbelievable prolixity, bad condition and inaccuracy of Aurifaber's translation, but mainly because many pieces have not been understood by him at all; in a whole number of them the exact opposite of what is written in the sources is given, many things are translated quite wrongly, many wrong readings, many things are inserted, many things are omitted, sections are torn apart and mixed up, introductions and conclusions are formed and the like, yes, sometimes complete nonsense.

Time, which confronts us in the diary. From the signature under the last number of the manuscript we see that the diary was completed in 1537, so no piece is to be placed after this year. The great mass of the speeches distinguished in it is to be placed in the 


years 1531-1533. On the whole, Luther's conversations are written down in the order in which they took place. 


The Zellerfeld manuscript is, as the comparison with his letters has shown, not written by Cordatus himself, but he probably compiled and arranged the notes in his notebooks 1) and copied them in all haste, 2) and then had them magnificently bound in the same year 1537. 3) 

It is very conspicuous that neither in the German nor in the Latin Table Talks Cordatus, as a recorder and collector of Luther's speeches, is remembered even with a single word, although not much less has passed from his records into the Table Talks than from those of Lauterbach, who is expressly mentioned. As far as we can make an estimate, 428 columns of Walch's edition from Lauterbach are included in the Tischreden, but about 360 columns from Cordatus: Only once do we encounter a trace of Cordatus being a collector of Luther's speeches, in the Nuremberg manuscript of the Collectaneen of Veit Dietrich, who made the marginal note on p. 69 with respect to No. 22 of the diary: "Cordatus exscripsit/." 

Cordatus is also rarely mentioned as a conversational companion in the Table Talks, namely Cap. 7, § 171: "Conrad Cordatus, who is angry by nature." Cap. 12, § 60: 


1) Tabulae, see No. 133. 

2) Cf. no. 1843. 

3) From a note by Wrampelmeyer, no. 706, note 3, we see that there is still a collection of table speeches by Cordatus in the royal library in Berlin, written by Sebastian Redlich in 1566 and 1567. This manuscript offers axopktkeKmatn I“utksri on fol. 8-133 and seems to contain excerpts from the Zellerfeld manuscript. The sample given there already shows several changes and deviations from the text used by us.

Rorer." 5) Cap. 26, § 30: "Therefore it is nothing that we go either to Philip or to Cordatus, .... Christ ... ls a thousand times better than I, or Philip, or Cordatus." 6) Cap. 37, § 16: "Which parish (at Niemeck) now has Conrad Cordatus." Cap. 55, § 6: "D. M. L. said in his garden in presence U. Hausmann, Cordati and Schlaginhaufen" 2c. These six passages are all that the German Tischreden offer about Cordatus. In the Hall manuscript (Bindseil) Il, 210 Cordatus is also still mentioned, but in the corresponding place Rebenstock II, 197 a has "Cruciger" and Aurifaber Cap. |, § 74 "of one." Furthermore, Cordatus is mentioned as present only once more in the Latin table speeches Bindseil |, 50; Rebenstock I, 286. 7) 

The Collectanea M. Hieronymi Besolds are mentioned in the Tischreden Cap. 5, § 5; 24, § 131; 27, § 154; those of the 14th Veit Dietrich Cap. 24, § 132; the record of M. Joh. Spangenberg is commemorated Cap. 12, § 86 to the end; Forster and Schlaginhaufen are named Cap. 37, §76; Mathesius is repeatedly mentioned Cap. 22, § 34; 27, § 114; 37, § 83; 44, § 24; 49, § 4. Rebenstock Il, 9 states that one piece is taken from the handwritten collections of M. Georg Rérer. Mathesius in his twelfth sermon also names Doctor Weller, M. Caspar Heydereich, M. Plato and Ferdinand a Mangis as recorders, Aurifaber in his preface also names M. Johann Stolsius and M. Jakob Weber, priest at Ordorf, and himself. However, the fact that of all the summarizers and editors of the Tischreden, Cordatus was not credited for even one piece of his more than a thousand numbers that were included in the Tischreden, is a mystery that we are not able to solve satisfactorily.

may be. The assumption raised by D. Wrampelmeyer probably gives information about why Cordatus himself did not come to the public with his diary, but also does not give a solution to this question. Wrampelmeyer says: 1) Neither Cordatus nor his heirs have given the Zellerfeld manuscript to others for use out of reverence for Luther 2) and as a result of Luther's Latin preface to the con- eiunculae amico cuidam praescriptae published in 1537, which is found in Luther's original before Cordatus' diary in the Zellerfeld manuscript. In this preface, which Stangwald and "Férstemann und Bindseil" also had preprinted in their edition of Luther's table speeches, Luther complains bitterly that his Wittenberg friends, during his illness in Schmalkalden, had published those sermons that he had not intended to print, but had only poured out during the midday and evening meals. Unwillingly, he protested against this procedure and exclaimed: 3) "I ask my pious thieves for the sake of Christ that they not be quick to publish anything, neither during my lifetime nor after my death: | beg my thieves, for the sake of Christ, not to be quick to publish anything, either during my lifetime or after my death, which they may have stolen from my thoughts while | was alive, or which they may have after my death from what they have already received before," and concludes: "Again, | beg that no friend publish anything that is mine without me-this requires both love and justice." Cordatus himself will have been that certain friend to whom the little sermons were communicated for instruction under the noon and evening meal. By this serious admonition of Luther he will also have been prevented from publishing the collected speeches of Luther himself, and from giving them to others for their use. But from the records of other table companions of Luther, namely Veit Dietrich and Schlaginhaufen, who heard and distinguished many things from Luther's mouth at the same time as Cordatus, then a

The majority of them have been incorporated into the Latin and German table speeches with considerable alterations. Among them there must have been someone who also made notes at the same time as Cordatus, although probably less frequently, which Kummer later included in his collection without changing much. Thus, Cordatus in his original version can very well be regarded as the indirect main source for the older parts of the later Latin and German table speeches. 

The most important of Cordatus' life fates, according to D. Wrampelmeyer the following: 1). Conrad Cordatus was born in 1476 in WeiBenkirchen in Austria of peasant parents who did not belong to the Hussite sect. He studied theology in Vienna between 1501 and 1508, where Conrad Celtis was his teacher. Soon after, he went to Ferrara, where he studied Thomas Aquinas and Gerson diligently and also received his doctorate. Then we find him in Rome, perhaps 1508-1509, to which No. 250 and No. 1536 of his diary refer. In 1510, he received a lucrative office in Ofen, the income from which he himself states to be 200 gulden. However, when he joined the Reformation movement after 1517, he was deposed, drafted and imprisoned for a long time, but finally released. 

Fugitive and penniless, he came to Wittenberg in 1524 to study Protestant theology, and became particularly attached to Luther, whose energetic nature appealed to him. In 1525 he dared to return to his homeland. No sooner had he begun to preach the gospel than he was again thrown into prison and his property confiscated. In a dark tower, darkness and snakes tormented and frightened him, but before his trial was over, a compassionate guard helped him to freedom after a confinement of 38 weeks. 

On July 1, 1526, he was back in Wittenberg. Very soon he received a call from Duke Frederick II of Liegnitz and Brieg to teach at his newly founded academy. However, this did not last and Cordatus left Silesia in April 1527. For the second time, Cordatus dared to 


Introduction. 5 


In 1528, Cordatus returned to Wittenberg, where he had the prospect of being employed by Queen Mary of Hungary, the sister of Carl V. However, this ‘chance’ came to nothing and we find Cordatus in Wittenberg again in 1528. Here he stayed, especially invited by Luther, for a longer time. In 1529, through Luther's mediation, he received the position of a second preacher at St. Mary's Church in Zwickau, which he held under difficult circumstances until 1531. The mayor Hermann Muhlpfort and the city syndic Stephan Roth together with the city council allowed themselves repeated encroachments on the rights of the clergy, and Cordatus therefore left the city of Zwickau with the first pastor Nicolaus Hausmann at Luther's urging. 

Now he returned to Wittenberg between July 10 and August 18, 1531, and this time seems to have spent 10-12 months as a guest in Luther's house. In 1532, Luther provided him with a pastorate in Niemeck near Wittenberg, where Georg Witzel had been forced to resign because of apostasy. Here he worked until 1537, but here too, as in all his positions, he had to struggle with hardship and all kinds of difficulties. Thus he complains in No. 1462 of his diary and is comforted by Luther. From there, he often visited Wittenberg and attended the lectures, and often stayed as a guest in Luther's house. In 1536 he began the violent theological dispute with Melanchthon over the doctrine of divine grace, to which No. 174 and No. 221 of his diary refer. 1) In May 1537 Cordatus received a call to Eisleben. Even before his resettlement there, he seems to have hastily compiled his notes on Luther. On July 9, 1537, he took up his new post to replace Johannes Agricola and to preach against Witzel, who had found a position in Eisleben (next to the preacher Caspar Gittel) through the line of the* Counts of Mansfeld, who had remained Catholic. Here, too, conditions were difficult and laborious. A ray of hope falls in this time

of his stay in Eisleben by the reconciliation with the badly offended Melanchthon. His doctorate in Protestant theology must also have taken place at this time. In 1540 he was appointed as Superintendent over all clergy and as Vicedechant of the Domstist at Stendal by the Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, with the assurance of a salary of 200 gulden along with free housing and some other emoluments. This was his last position and at the same time the most difficult of all. Here he took strict action against the immoral life of the still papist clergy, but experienced such hostility for it that he almost despaired after his letters to Luther and other friends in Wittenberg. Luther tried to comfort him with the words of the 110th Psalm: "Rule in the midst of your enemies", but his complaints always resounded again. Until February 1546 Cordatus administered his office in Stendal under heavy worries and troubles. Then an honorable call went out to him from his sovereign, that he should complete a doctorate in Frankfurt on the Oder. But on the journey, as Melanchthon says in the preface to the Cordatus Postille, he "fell ill, as an old man of great kelt and afterwards in Christian consolation departed from this mortal world to the eternal churches in heaven” in the spring of 1546, soon after Luther's death. He is said to be buried in the cathedral at Stendal. 

That Cordatus stood in a close personal relationship to Luther, yes, that he was one of Luther's most trusted and loyal friends, is indicated to us by various circumstances. He made his notes in Luther's house and at Luther's table, as we can see from No. 133 and 133 a of his diary, and 21 letters, which Luther addressed to Cordatus from the year 1526 to 1545, are still preserved. 2) Many of the communicated conversations are especially with Cordatus, e.g. No. 33. 56. 57. 111. lila. 111b. 74. 75/115. 116. 1)61. 162. 253. 259. 637. 843. 1240. 1462, 3) and

the importance of the manuscript has not become clear to him. The manuscript itself, written on individual paper layers of 8 octavo leaves each, then first bound and on the spine of the pigskin binding above as “popb ; - thus in later time, because not Apoteg- mata (they!), what Kmnmer has- in writing designates, is made by foreign hand, in the time of 1546 to 1548 and compiled from individual notes of Lauterbach, perhaps by his Famulus Balthasar Tham. 1) 

L au terba ch, born in Stolpen Thursday, January 13, 1502, was the elder son of not impecunious parents,’ probably of Matthaus Lauterbach, mayor of Stolpen and the wife of the same, Katharina. The family had its name from the Amtsdoxfe Lauterbach near Stolpen. About his father the event is told, which is reported to us in the table speeches in the last paragraph of Cap. 27, § 72. In the summer of 1517, Anton Lauterbach was immatriculated in Leipzig. Only in 1529, Wednesday, April 21, he is inscribed in Wittenberg under the rectorate of U. Johann Stoeb Ginckelyn as "Anthonius Lauterbach de Stolpen". 2) He also received his master's degree in Wittenberg, was Luther's housemate and table companion as early as 1531, and served at the baptismal banquet for Luther's son Paul on January 28, 1533. He was a man of long stature. As successor of the wasteful Valentin Pacaus Hartung he came to Leisnig as Diaconus in 1533. Here he soon got into disagreements with his pastor M. Wolfgang FuB, which is why Luther arrested him for the second Diaconate in Wittenberg in 1537. He probably married the nun Agnes in Wittenberg as early as 1533, because the Bishop of Meissen, Johann VII von Schleinitz, took offense at his marriage when he was to become deacon in Leisnig. 3) His grief- stricken father-in-law is remembered Tischr.

daughter Elisabeth, to whom Luther and his niece Lene Kaufmann seem to have been godparents, and ason. 

Wednesday, July 23, 1539, Lauterbach moved to Pirna as superintendent. During his stay in Wittenberg, Lauterbach copied Luther's sermons as early as 1531. From Pirna he seems to have traveled to Wittenberg once every year; /we know this from the years 1542-1545 inol. Lauterbach preached his inaugural sermon in Pirna on the 8th Sunday after Trinity, July 27, 1539, and died there on Monday, July 18, 1569. His bust can be found above the door to the sacristy of the town church twice. He founded the church library in Pirna. One of his favorite sayings seems to have been: Qui cupit esse beatus, discat contemnere et contemni (If you want to be happy, learn to despise and endure contempt). 

The Royal Public Library in Dresden possesses the same diary in a second, somewhat later copy ina quarto volume, which is immediately followed by a second part of Luther's table speeches 1), which only rarely provide an indication of day and year, but deviate in the most varied way from that given in Bindseil's Latin imprint, entirely with regard to the position of the individual pieces. The first half, the diary, was copied in 1554 by the pastor Caspar Kummer of Ortrand on the first pages by another, perhaps his son Caspar or Abraham, but then also wrote much himself, while the second half is entirely by his hand. The copy of the first part was completed on the Sunday after the Exaltation of the Cross (Sept. 14), which was the 17th Sunday after Trinity, in 1554, that of the second part on Nov. 22, 1554. Kummer was registered on Tuesday, May 11, 1529, under the rectorate of Caspar von Teutleben in the Wittenberg university register as "Caspar khumer ex langfelt patavien. dioc. 


4) With respect to these, Seidemann states that they also originate from Lauterbach's dep notes. From the selection given by Seidemann, we see that a large number of deftelben are also found in Cordatus.

41 Because he was persecuted in his fatherland because of "the" religion, he had to flee in female clothing, whereupon he turned to Wittenberg, where Luther is said to have appointed him to the pastorate in Ortrand. The time in which he took up his office as pastor there falls in the years between 1541 and 1545. He is also otherwise referred to as Lengenfeldianus Austri acus, from Lanfeld (also Lengefeld) from Eastern Austria. At the second church visitation held on May 30, Thursday 1555, he is given the censure: "Is found correct and good life.” How long Kummer was in office in Ortrand cannot be determined. His successor Johannes Ruhl is only mentioned in 1575 as pastor in Ortrand on the occasion of a church visitation. Kummer and Lauterbach were fellow students in Wittenberg.

Grief closest. Not infrequently, Kummer comes very close in version and form. However, there are also many deviations, some of which Kummer does not offer completely, and the interspersed German already shows far more recent forms, since Kummer's table speeches were compiled much later. 

These main sources of the Table Talks, the diary of D. Conrad Cordatus from 1537 and the diary of M. Anton Lauterbach about the year 1538, bear the stamp of authenticity and immediacy. We have endeavored to reproduce the meaning exactly everywhere, and have retained as faithfully as possible the passages given in German in the originals, which offer Luther's short, concise, sometimes proverbial speech.

and often in them reference is made to incidents which are also mentioned in the table speeches. Everywhere, however, there is only sameness and similarity of thought, never of form, except for a similar version of some cited verses, e.g. Mathesius p. 224 and Tischr. Cap. 78, § 3. The manuscript ,Apophthegmatai Lutheri", which Christian August Freyberg in the school programs mentioned earlier, is assigned to the Mathesius, is not a copy.

Important and interesting are some sayings of Mathesius about the table speeches of Luther. 

At the beginning of the 12th sermon, Mathesius tells us that he came to Luther's table in 1540 through the promotion of D. Justus Jonas and M. Georg Roérer. Justus Jonas' and M. Georg Rorer's promotion. He says: "What | heard and saw there, | noted with diligence; so God gave me, through the help of industrious people, many good colloquia and conversations, which before N. Veit Dietrich of Nuremberg, Doctor Well er of Freyburg, Mr. Antonius Lauterbach of Pirna and afterwards M. Caspar Heyderich, Superintendent at Torgau, N. Hieronymus Besold of Nuremberg and others of the doctor's boarders had advertised. Ferdinand a Mangis from Eastern Austria also recorded many interpretations of some sayings in his Bible, as M. Georg Rorer Diel very diligently brought together delicious things of writings and advice and especially what was spoken in the interpretation of the Bible."

thesius about how the conversations at the table came about: "Although our doctor often took heavy and deep thoughts with him to the table, and sometimes kept his old monastic silence during the whole meal, so that not a word was spoken at the table, he let himself be heard very amusingly at the appropriate time; as we used to call his speeches condimenta mensae, which were dearer to us than all spices and delicious food. 

When he wanted to extract speech from us, he used to make an accusation: "What's new? The first admonition we let pass; when he stopped again: When he stopped again, "You prelates, what's new in the country?" the old people at the table began to talk. Doctor Wolf Severus, who had been the preceptor of the Roman Royal Majesty, sat at the top, he brought something on the track, if no stranger was present, as a wandering courtier." 

"When the discussion started, 2) but with due discipline and reverence, others sometimes added their part to it, too, until maw

For a small part of the German table speeches, M. Johann Aurifaber, or Goldschmidt, who was around Luther in the years 1545 and 1546, and also accompanied him on his last journey to Eisleben, is to be listed as the first recorder. All pieces originating from him are contained only in the German editions, which also confirms that the Latin table speeches do not go back to the German ones as their original. 

The table speeches, written down by Aurifaber as an eye and ear witness, are as follows: Cap. 1, § 10, para. 1 and § 22. the addition to § 22; § 26; § 45, para.

As a reason why Rebenstock's collection, which was ready for printing in 1561, was held back for another ten years, Seidemann assumes (preface p. IV) that Lauterbach and Agricola were still alive. The former died in 1569, the latter on September 22, 1566. 

From a note in Seidemann's preface, p. IV, we see that a manuscript very similar to the Hallische is in the Dresden Bibliotbek. 


Introduction. 


Of the latter, Seidemann p. V says: "Rebenstock and the Dresden manuscript are closest to each other. ... - Yes, the Dresden manuscript is perhaps taken from the one that Rebenstock used for his editing, according to Fr. Jacobs and F. A. Ukert, Beitrage zur alteren Litteratur oder Merkwirdigkeiten der herzoglichen 6ffentlichen Bibliothek zu Gotha Bd.il! Heft 2. Leipzig 1843. p. 309: ,, ,,Colloquia serotina D.M.L. 1536 et sqq. 22. Octobr. descripta ex auT6- yeagw Antonii Lauterbachii primi Superint. Pirn. in Misn. anno 1553 manu Pauli Judicis al. Richteri prim. Pastoris Neap. s. Neustad. prope Pirnam. Ch. B. no. 169. 144 581." "" to which there is noted that this collection is contained in the vine, cf. p. 306." 

Walch's judgment on the Rebenstock edition, preface p. 20, is completely correct. He says: "In this Latin edition, one and the other occurs, which is not in the Aurifaber work, but it also appears, if one holds both books against each other, such a similarity that one can see that, if not everything, nevertheless most 1) and at least very much is to be found in the Aurifaber collection, which the Rebenstock edition contains. 

Elias Frick in his German translation of V. L. von Seckendorf's "Ausfihrlicher Historie des Lutherthums" p. 2734 makes a similar judgment and also correctly gives the year 1571 for both volumes of Rebenstock. The judgment of Joh. Ernst Eberhardt in his Schediasma § 8 is wrong: "a Germanica plane diversa", unless one interprets these words only to the order of the pieces, but not also to the content. 

In order that the reader may judge for himself, we include a comparison of a passage from Rebenstock with the Hadllische Handschrift, the German Tischreden and the sources. We choose the section "De tentationibus, Rebenstock Vol. Il, 220 b to 233". The same is complete in the Latin and the German Tischreden. The superscription is erroneously retained by Rebenstock for several more pages. 


|) We would say "almost everything".

In the preceding sections, the Latin and German editions coincide completely, and most of it is also proven in the sources and brought into our edition from them. This also applies to the pieces of this section, which are found only in the Hall manuscript, but not in Rebenstock. The same is true for most of the sections; however, the situation is quite different for a few. From these, we see that almost everything found in 


of the Rebenstockfchen edition is also found in the Hall manuscript, but also quite a number of pieces are missing in the German Tischreden. In order to prove this, we place a comparative table here over the section that bears the superscription 1): De D. M. Luth, ejus doctrina, vita, morbis et periculis. Rebenstock, Lom. Il, 12a-24a.

From this table, one can see that in this section of Rebenstock, which comprises 24 pages, only 3 pieces are missing in Bindseil, but that of the 40 pieces that were missing from this section in the German Tischreden, 19 could be inserted into our edition according to the originals. Given the poor textual quality of both Rebenstock and the Hall manuscript, nothing from these could be included in our edition. 


2. H. E. Bindseil's edition of Haltt's manuscript. 


There is in the public library of the orphanage in Halle a Latin manuscript of Luther's table speeches, consisting of 654 folio leaves, with the date: "transscripta anno 1560", which has been edited by Bindseil under the following title: D. Martini Lutheri colloquia, meditationes, consolationes, judicia, sententiae, narrationes, responsa, facetiae e codice MS. bibliothecae orphanotrophei Halensis cum perpetua collatione editionis Rebenstockianae edita et pro- legomenis indicibusque instructa ab Henrico Er- nesto Bindseil, Philos.

Lauterbach xa§. 165. 


X pages of preface. Tom. Ill. 1866. 331 pages. From pp. 332-516 various indexes. XII ropes preface. 

Bindseil considers the Hall manuscript published by him to be a Latin translation of the German table speeches 1) as does Rebenstock his collection. He was therefore also unaware that the original records were mainly made in Latin with individual words and phrases left in German. He disregarded, or perhaps did not believe, what Aurifaber says in his second preface of July 1, 1568: "that the Tischreden were brought by him from Latin into German sayings," which, as we now know, is true. 

Wrampelmeyer remarks in his preface p. 29: "Rebenstock offers almost nothing that could not be found in Bindseil, while the Hall manuscript - and this seems to us to be far from appreciated enough - has handed down a large amount of conversations, of which no trace is to be found in Rebenstock. This remark has prompted us to make at least a partial comparison. With respect to the first volume

Bindseil editions are based. These introductions are found in Bindseil Vol. I. S, 1.7.10. 13. 22. 25. 34. 54. 68. 74. 82. 84. 95. 98. 110.

The other pieces missing in the German Tischreden are in Bindseil Vol. |. at the following 


German Tischreden which Bindseil described as being only in the Latin ones. 

The fact that it was possible for Bindseil to indicate the deviations of Rebenftock's edition in notes from beginning to end proves that the similarity of both editions must be very great. Since Bindseil lists all of Rebenstock's translations, this already results in a very large number of notes. Another reason for comments are the numerous printing errors in Rebenstock. 

In order to enable the reader to compare the Hall manuscript and the German Tischreden with his own eyes, we have included a table on a section from the third volume, which comprises 24 pages. From this section, "Concionatores". Concionatores", Bindseil

Introduction. 





Bindseil's assumption, 1) that Lauterbach was the collector of the Hall manuscript, has been completely destroyed by the discovery of Lauterbach's diary. One only needs to compare one or several pieces with each other to convince oneself of this. In the table just presented, we see that both in the Hall manuscript and in the German Tischreden, the number of pages according to Lauterbach is almost regularly greater than the number of pages in the German manuscript.

is. From this it is clear that both Aurifaber and the collector of the Hall manuscript had Lauterbach's diary in front of him in the same order as we do. Not so with the records of Cordatus. 

The Hall manuscript contains a significant number of incorrect readings, some of which have been increased by Bindseil's unfortunate improvements.

Johannes Aurifaber or Goldschmidt. He was Luther's table companion in 1545 and 1546 and around him, also at the end of his life in Eisleben. As court preacher in Weimar, 1551-1562, he was removed from office for attempting to insert into the Jena edition of Luther's works other than Luther's own authentic writings. 2) He then went to Eisleben in Mansfeld, where he received maintenance and salary from Vollrath, Count of Mansfeld, and his brother, in order to publish the writings of Luther.

Introduction. , 


In 1564 and 1565, he also published the second volume of his letters to Luther, the first of which had already gone out of print in 1556. They appeared in 1564 and 1565. The second volume of his letters of Luther also came out in 1565; the first had already gone out in print in 1556. Then in 1566 he became pastor at the Preacher's Church and senior minister at Erfurt, where he died in 1576, aged 56. The title of the first edition of the Tischreden is: "Tischreden Oder Colloquia Doct. Mart. Luthers, So er in vielen Jaren, gegen gelarten Leute, auch frembden Gesten, vnd seinen Tischgesellen geflret. According to the main pieces of our Christian lore, compiled. John 6, Cap. Samlet die vbrigen Brocken, Auff dass nichts vmbkome. Printed at Eisleben, by Vrban Gaubisch. 1566." Folio. The preface comprises 9 leaves and % ropes. Then follow two pages of indexes of the main sections with incorrect numbering, 82 instead of 80. The table speeches take 625A leaves, including the addendum: "Andere Tischreden D. M. Luthers" 2c. Finally, an index of 16-1/2 leaves, arranged alphabetically. 

The preface of Aurifaber is a letter: "To the noble, 

honorable, honorable and wise Ammeistern, Stadtpflegern, Aelteren, Geheimbden, Burgermeister und Rath der Kayserlichen Reichsstadte StraBburg, Augspurg, Ulm, Nurnberg, Ltbeck, Hamburg, LUneburg, Braunschweig, Frankfurth am Mayn und Regenspurg 2c. My Grand Favorable Lords." With regard to this dedication, Seidemann makes a very significant remark in his preface to Lauterbach pag. V: "A letter from the Nuremberg City Council to Aurifaber of September 12, 1566, in which he thanks him for sending a copy of the Tischreden and its dedication to the city of Nuremberg, sending 20 gold gilden as a tribute to it, provides an attractive insight into Aurifaber's activity. Cf. Anzeiger fir Kunde der deutschen Vorzeit. Vol. XVI. 1869. p. 336. Most of Aurifaber's preface is of no particular interest for the history of the editions of the Table Talks, so we only reprint the end of it here: "And after | have so far read several tomos from behind the table”.

After that | have also taken many good things from the Collectaneis Colloquiorum written by Magister Johann Stolsii, blessed, and Magister Jacobi Weber, pastor of Ordorf, and put them into this Tomum. And because |, Johannes Aurifaber, before the death of D. Martin Luther in 1545 and 1546, was also much around D. M.

For one should not let such table speeches of Luther from high spiritual things perish, but hold them high and valuable.

As early as 1567, two editions appeared in Frankfurt am Main, one in folio, the other in two octavo volumes. The title of the folio edition is: Colloquia, Oder Tischreden Doctor Martini Lutheri, so er in vielen jaren die Zeyt seiner Lebens, gegen Gelehrten Leuthen, Auch hin vnd wider bei frembden' Gesten, vnd seinen Tischgeesehret gefuhrtt, darinn von allen Articklen vnser Religion, Auch von hohen Fragen vnnd Richtigen Antworten, vnd sonst von allerley Lehr, Rath, Trost, Weissagung, vnderricht zu finden.

(Below a woodcut, Luther with 6 others sitting at the table and 4 children standing in front of it, who perform their table prayers with folded hands). Printed at Frankfurt am Mayn, 2c. 1567." Also in this edition, as in the first edition, the section "Von etlicher Papisten schnellen und erschrecklichem Tode" is 


26th main piece "Von Zauberey" is missing in the index, but not in the text. 

Perhaps these two editions from 1567 are reprints, because no printer is named in them, and both have "By Johann Aurifaber" on the title, which Aurifaber himself would hardly have set that way. On the other hand, Aurifaber says in his preface to the edition of 1568: "As the same last German Tomus of Luther's Tischreden has been well out of print and very much available for sale, so that it has often had to be published and reprinted," by which these Frankfurt prints can well be meant. Several misprints from the folio edition of 1567 have been transferred to the edition of 1568, which Aurifaber acknowledges as his own by a new preface, from which it seems to follow 


GrUndlichen| that he also regarded the edition of 1567 as his own. 


1) With respect to this, Walch says in his preface p. 8, note x: "Of these editions of Luther's Tischreden that have now been cited, | still note that they have not all been printed accurately and correctly, and sometimes important printing errors that were in one have been retained in the other. One will notice this clearly if one holds the two editions of 1567 and 1568 against each other. Among other things, in both p. 89 under the

By comparing the folio edition of 1567 with the authentic one of 1568, a printing expert would like to determine from the type of printing the office in which the edition of 1567 was printed. We assume that it would turn out that the edition of 1567 was already printed by Simon Hiter, since Aurifaber says in the preface of 1568: "because my particularly dear gentleman and good friend Simon Hiter, bookseller at Frankfurt, wanted to publish and print this ‘lomuna of the table speeches' again.

In 1568, also at Frankfurt am Main, a new edition appeared in folio with a new preface by Aurifaber in which he complains about changes that had been made to his table speeches. Walch has taken his text from this edition. This preface is_ particularly interesting and important. We therefore place it here in its entirety from Walch's old edition. It is already written from Erfurt. 


"Preface to the 1568 Edition." 


"To the Christian Reader." 

"After |, by God's help, had undertaken this Christian, useful and necessary work some years ago, what of the venerable and noble man of God, D. M. Luther's, holy memory, books, sermons and writings, which he read, preached and wrote in Wittenberg, and which have not come to light and day until now, to prepare them and to communicate them to the Christian Church for teaching and consolation through printing. As | have compiled and written the twelve tomos of the German and Latin books of Doctor Maxtini Luther, printed at Jena, when | was then Princely Saxon Court Preacher, in a proper order, and have included many good writings, advice and trades that had not been seen before. The godly man, M. Georg Rérer, was appointed corrector and supervisor by the noble princes and lords, the dukes of Saxony, brothers, my gracious princes and lords. And after that | surrendered to the county of Mansfeld, and had two German Tomos, also a Latin one of Epistles, and a German Tomum of the Table Talks printed at Eisleben. When the last German Tomus of Luther's Table Speeches had gone out of print and was very much for sale, so that it had to be reprinted many times, | now find that Master Kligling has come upon such my work and labor, and changed the title. 


23 


| have also moved a lot in the book, and at various times | have increased and improved my work with new table speeches, which have all been done without my knowledge and will, to whom | should otherwise give an answer and account for this work of the table speeches. This hurts me, and is not good, that one wants to sully, rummage through and destroy it according to everyone's liking, that which | have compiled with unspeakable effort, hard work and many great tastes, from books and collections written by many learned people who have gone around with Doctor Martin Luther, into an order and into certain locos communes. Such a thing is not to be suffered by me in any way. For this reason, | would like to ask and warn everyone who will reprint such a book of the Table Talks, because if there is someone who would know how to improve and increase these Table Talks, | could do it (without glory), since | still have several written books of Luther's Table Talks with me, from which one could almost read a new volume together, or improve the now much reported first printed part wonderfully and enormously. And because | have received such a tome from the next Frankfurt fair, with other table speeches and epistles renewed and improved, which appendix and addition | have read through and find that much of it was previously printed in the table speeches, and was brought from the Latin by me into the German language, so the letters are also found in part in the German Jenische: so | do not like to see that one should buy old for new, and the people are swept off their feet by the new titles and improvements. And remember well that Doctor Martin Luther, of blessed memory, complained many times that his books, which he had published in Wittenberg, were being reprinted elsewhere in Germany, and that words were often changed in them, and that the books were badly smeared, so that for this reason he issued a public admonition to the book printers in the 28th year. And because my special dear gentleman and good friend Simon Hiter, bookseller at Frankfurt, wanted to publish and print this Tomum of the Table Talks again, after the copy at Eisleben. 


24 


Introduction. 





| have sent him my well-meaning warning against printing this book. Done on the first day of July, Anno 1568, Johannes Aurifaber, pastor of Predigern in Erfurt. 

With regard to Aurifaber's above-mentioned complaint about changes to the Tischreden, Walch, Preface p. 8, remarks: "What Aurifaber actually meant by this for editions: if, where and under what title they were printed, | cannot say. Among those editions that | have at hand and that were printed before Aurifaber made the noted complaint, | find none that would have been changed to the extent he reported. It would have been good if he had given special notice of such altered editions." Bindseil remarks on this in the preface to the German edition Vol. IV, p. XXVII: "Il also have the same opinion, after | compared both Frankfurt editions of 1567 with the one of 1566 in general; for with the exception of the slight alteration of the title and a part of the spelling, | have not perceived any significant deviation," 

In 1569, a new edition was published in folio in Frankfurt am Main, with the same preface that preceded the first edition of 1566. This year, however, is changed in this edition to the year 1569, as such a change in the year was also made in other later editions, according to the years in which they appeared. In this edition there is a special appendix with the inscription: "Colloguia or Table Talks of D. M. L., so the dear man of God has led against learned theologians and pastors shortly before his end and blessed departure from this world, satmt many comfort writings, missives, and histories, answers to manifold questions" 2c. It is accompanied by a letter to the council of the city of Rauschenburg, dated March 24, 1568, from Johann Finck, who reports in it that he has drawn these speeches of Luther from several written books and from the writings of the same. This appendix is followed by: "Prophecies of D. M. Luther, for the Remembrance and Incentive to Christian Penance, Neatly and Diligently Compiled”. 


carried by M. Georg Walther, preacher at Halle in Saxony". Walch notes in his preface p. 9, note g.: "Such an appendix of table speeches, which the aforementioned Johann Finck added, has been omitted from both other and subsequent editions, and rather that which is found at the end of the 1566 and 1567 editions has been retained; in the 1568 edition, however, it has been inserted, except for a few pieces, into the work itself at the appropriate place. The Propheceyungen Lutheri are found in the newest editions of the Tischreden Lutheri of 1700 and 1723, of which | will speak hereafter, but they are not found in the older editions. 

In addition to these, two other editions of Luther's Tischreden are listed, which were published in Eisleben by Urban Gaubisch in 1569 and 1577 in folio, shown in des Fabricii centifolio Lutheran. p. 801. The first edition of 1569 mentioned above, published in Frankfurt, is probably a reprint, because in the same year the publisher of the first edition, Urban Gaubisch in Eisleben, also published the edition just mentioned, and no printer is named in the Frankfurt edition. 

All these editions are only different imprints of Aurifaber's first edition of 1566. 


d. Stangwald's edition. 


According to the time, the closest to these Aurifaber editions is the one by Andreas Stangwald, Candidate of Theology from Prussia. Until now, the difference between this edition and Aurifaber's has been presented as greater than it really is. We have compared Stangwald's edition of 1700, in which, according to Walch's testimony1) "nothing has been left out, nothing has been added to it", with the first Aurifaber edition of 1566. The result of this comparison is the following: In Stangwald's edition, everything is found that is in Aurifaber's edition, with the exception of ea. 146 pieces, which

Introduction. 








The same copy was printed in Frankfurt am Main by Thomas Rebart's blessed heirs, and was subsequently printed several times in Leipzig. 

"But because the copies had all been distributed, so that none could be obtained, | have, at the suggestion of good friends and with the foreknowledge and permission of the venerable Consistorii at Weimar, taken the copy again under hand, with the written table speeches, which | had together in good number, diligently and faithfully conferiret, and after the same corrigiret and in such Correctur diligently before eyes had the Notationes of the venerable, hochgelahrten Herr Doctoris Joachimi Moerlini blessed, which he in his copy of the 1st print of the TischReden with his own. (as he belonged to Luther for several years, and as he was then deacon of the churches at Wittenberg, had been much around Luther), and of other Christian theologians, have also added to the work other such memorable speeches and colloquies of Luther, which Mathesius and other faithful disciples of Luther mentioned in their writings, and have also occasionally, for further instruction and explanation, taken from other proven writings of Luther. Luther's writings,’ something little added, finally also prepared with industrious registers in such a way that my hope is that it can now be used by men only for benefit and fruit. In its time (God willing), in the other part, the Colloquia Lutheri, and other gentlemen who lived with and beside Luther, which are still in the background, are also to be given to the Christian reader in proper order, along with all kinds of Apophthegmata and memorable speeches of the Christian emperors, kings, princes and chieftains who lived in these last times, and finally also Apophthegmata Sanctorum Dei in veteri Ecclesia. 2) Since then also ina

special appendices all sorts of Microgtapha Lutheri, that is, short memorial writings, which D. Luther, either to himself or to others, as a memory in the books, on notes, on the walls 2c. listed. Item, his Latin poemata. Item, his proverbs, his Onomastioon or Namen-Bichlein, his Fabulae Aesopi, and other joke writings, and what such, so actually does not belong in the Tomos of Luther's witty writings, should be communicated to the Christian reader, so that with knowledge also not the slightest of D. Luther's work, so as to serve edification, is left behind." 

"Concerning the Historia of the Life and the Blessed Departure of Doctor Martin Luther, as a short excerpt of which was included in the Leipzig printing of the Tisch-Reden before this time, | have omitted it from this printing for considerable reasons; since in the Narrationibus de Vita Lutheri that have been published up to this time, | have found various inaccuracies and displeasures. But (God willing) a detailed Historia, not only of the life and departure, but also of the books and writings of D. Luther, and especially of the German Biblia, and the Church Postillen, so also Tomorum Lutheri, printed at Wittenberg, Jena, and Eisleben, shall be given to the Christian reader. 

In the 1700 edition, Stangwald's appendix comprises pages 821-868, i.e. 48 folio pages. Everything in this appendix is also found in all of Aurifaber's editions, but scattered throughout the work, except for a small section on p. 822, which is another version of Appendix § 4, and a small section on p. 844, which offers in Latin what Cap. 37, § 127 in German translation. This appendix is also found in Selnecker's editions. 

The whole difference between Stangwald's and Aurifaber's editions comes down to the following: 1. the order of Stangwald's edition is completely different from that of Aurifaber's edition. In order to make this clear to the reader, we will show, with reference to a part of a chapter, how far the order given in that chapter is different from that of the Aurifaber edition.

As a proof for the complete change of the arrangement in Stangwald's edition, this will probably be sufficient. On these 10 pages of Stangwald, we encounter 8 duplicates, of which he has 6 in common with Aurifaber. The content of these 10 pages is widely scattered through 5 volumes in the Erlangen edition, and it is quite the same with any other section, from beginning to end. 

2. stangwald has about 146 duplicates less than the aurifaber edition. He has the great mass of duplicates in common with Aurifaber. The following 6 duplicates are peculiar to him: p. 225* and 768; p. 228. 249 and 838"; p. 405 * and second appendix p. 6 in another translation; p. 100 and 332; p. 201* and 330; p. 388 and 826. 

Stangwald first attempted to separate the extraneous items that do not actually belong to the Tischreden, and relegated them to an appendix of 48 pages. These include pieces borrowed or translated from other writings of Luther, sermons, prefaces, letters, concerns, inscriptions in books, verses, disputations, and other things that are not by Luther, and he has always provided proof of their origin, where he himself was aware of it. 


1) It is therefore very difficult to find the pieces of Stangwald's edition in Aurisaber's, and vies vsrka.

On the whole, Stangwald and also Selnecker have adopted Aurifaber's translation. He has almost everywhere the same wrong readings as Aurifaber. Therefore, not much can be drawn from his edition with respect to essential textual correction. However, it must be acknowledged with gratitude that Stangwald has made many real improvements to the text, but they seem to us to have been introduced more by good sound judgment than from manuscript sources. We have also made use of some of them. 

Stangwald has often softened the coarseness of Aurifaber's edition.

Introduction. 


He was court preacher in Dresden, professor of theology in Jena in 1565, professor of theology in Leipzig in 1568, court preacher and general superintendent in Wolfenbittel in 1570. In 1574 he went back to Leipzig and again took over the theological professorship he had held before; in 1576 he also assumed the office of superintendent there. When in 1589, at the instigation of those secretly associated with Calvin, he was deprived of these offices, he initially went to Halle and later to Magdeburg, but the following year, in 1590, he came to Hildesheim as superintendent, and from there again to Leipzig in 1592, where he died soon after his arrival. 1) 

This famous theologian published soon after Aurifaber's death (1576), in 1577 at Leipzig an edition of the Table Talks, in folio, which is only a reprint of the so-called first Stangwald's 2) edition published in 1571 at Frankfurt. Selnecker notes in his preface, Leipzig in February 1577, only this, that "now des Tewren Mans, Doctoris Mart. Lutheri Gottseligen, our German prophet's Tischreden, allhie zu Leipzig, nicht auf grosse vrsachen, fleiBiger und férmlicher, denn anderswo zuvor geschehen, gedruckt worden, wie dieselbigen Er Johannes Aurifaber seliger, trewlich colligirt, vnd vns mitgetheilet hat". This preface is signed Nicolaus Selneccerus D., pastor of Leipzig. It is dedicated "to the Most Illustrious, Highborn Prince and Lord, Mr. Ludwigen Pfaltzgraffen bey Reyn, of the H. Roman Empire Ertz Truchses vnd Churflrsten, Hertzogen in Bayern 2c." Then follows Aurifaber's first preface of 1566, but in this edition, as in the Frankfurt edition of 1571, erroneously dated 1569. This is followed by: "Historica oratio Nicolai Sel-.

The latter deviates from Walch, Vorrede, p. 12, Note in that he places his birth in the year 1532, the professorship in Jena in the year 1561, the first return to Leipzig in the year 1577.

necceri vom Leben und Wandel des ehrwirdigen Herrn und theuren Mannes GOttes v. M. Luthers", which Stangwald mentions in his preface in 1591 ina disapproving manner. Selnecker had already had this description of his life specially printed in octavo in Leipzig in 1576. In his first edition of the Tischreden, it fills 26% unfoliated leaves. Then follows a "register of the chapters as they follow one another". These are the same 43 chapters as in the Frankfurt edition of 1571, with the same 9 main Latin headings. This is followed by 3 pages of "Kurzes Register der fuernembsten Materien nach Ordnung' des Alphabets", which is followed on 2 pages by a "Judex biblicus". Then follows the work itself on 505 foliated leaves. On sheet 505 b begins the "Appendix. Or Appendix of several matters, so D. M. Luther erkleret" 2c., which occupies 23/2 not numbered leaves. This is followed by 5 leaves "Register der deutschen auslegung D. Lutheri, vber die Bucher der Bibel, Gerichtet auff die Wittenbergischen, Jenischen und EiBlebischen Tomos" with a prefatory note "Dem Christlichen Leser Nicolaus Selnecceruss". "Datum Leipzig 1577." On the last leaf, "Gedruckt zu Leipzig, durch Jacob Berwalds Erben, Anno M.D.LXXVII." The title of this edition is as follows: "Colloquia. Or Christliche NuUtzliche Tischreden Doctoris Martini Lutheri, so er in vielen Jaren, gegen Gelehrten Leute, und frembden Gesten und seinen Tischgenossen, nach den Hauptstticken unserer Christlichen Lehre, gehalten,: First by Mr. M. Johannem Aurisabrum blessed, diligently compiled, and put into print. Now they have been brought into a new order, and prepared in such a way that they are very necessary, useful, and comforting for all Christians to read, especially in these miserable last times. Together with a new preface, and a short description of the life and life of Doctor Luther, and a very useful register at the end of this book, all the books and chapters of the Divine, Holy Scripture, where, and when the same Doctor Lutherus has interpreted, and explained, and in which Tomis such interpretation can be found. 


3) The title of the 1581 edition is quite similar to this one.

New editions appeared in 1580 and 1581. The edition of 1577 was in the hands of the editor of the Erlangen edition, the one of 1580 was used by Walch, the one of 1581 by Férstemann and Bindseil. This last edition was unknown to Walch. According to the description of the 1581 edition by FérstemannBindseil, it is quite similar to the first one of 1577. 

About the Selnecker edition Walch says, Preface p. 13: "In this edition itself, the same order has been retained that Stangwald used in his edition, and the latter has been reprinted almost in its entirety, except that here and there one or the other difference is apparent; However, since Stangwald's edition came to light before Selnecker's, and since in the latter a different arrangement was first made than one finds in Aurifaber's, then, if one wants to show the difference between such editions, If one wants to show the difference between such editions, one should not contrast both Selnecker's, as is generally done, and Stangwald's with Aurifaber's, whether the latter, or Selnecker's, can to a certain extent also be considered a special one, and where one does this, three different editions can be noted." 

The editor of the Erlangen edition has had the oldest editions of Stangwald's and Selnecker's editions in his hands, and makes the following judgment about the mutual relationship of these two editions to each other.

We were so

Introduction. 


fortunate to obtain both editions, and have found that the Jnhalts-Verzeichniss of Selnecker's first edition of 1577 agrees so literally and literally with that of Stangwald's of 1571 that only the following two variants had to be applied. Namely, in the heading of chapter 28, the word "Co- nuenten” is printed in Latin letters in Stangwald's edition, and in German letters ("Conuenten") in Selnecker's edition, and in the heading of chapter 33, the word "D." is printed in Stangwald's edition, but in Selnecker's edition it is "Doct. printed. This is the whole difference in the table of contents. The "Kurze Register der flrnehmsten Materien", which follows, consists in both editions of 187 identical headings, and in the "Index bibli- cus" Stangwald has only 4 more biblical passages than Selnecker, everything else is the same. The sequence of the material and individual sections has been the same in both editions everywhere we have looked up and compared them, except that Selnecker has often omitted headings of the paragraphs in Stangwald's work, thus combining several smaller sections into one larger one and sometimes skipping a section that he may have placed elsewhere. Selnecker has also taken the marginal glosses verbatim from Stangwald and even in the appendix no other deviation of both editions from each other is noticeable, except that Selnecker has omitted several Latin verses and citations, which are found in Stangwald, and added at the end the aforementioned register of 4% sheets. Yes, even Stangwald's explanatory notes in small print, in which he speaks of himself in the first person, are included verbatim in Selnecker's edition, as for example in "Melanchthon's Disputation with Luther on Justification" and in the "Book of the Birth of the Desolate Abomination of the Antichrist". We can therefore consider Selnecker's edition to be nothing more than a reprint of Stangwald's Redaction, as Stangwald himself correctly called it in the preface to his new edition of 1591, and we must agree with Walch when he asserts that one should not oppose Aurifaber's Redaction with Selnecker's, but only’ with Stangwald's. 


Introduction. 


Both editions, Stangwald's and Selnecker's, have not been distinguished from each other even by learned, famous theologians; thus Walch mentions in his preface p. 14, 2nd column: "When the famous Mr. Johann Albr. Fabricius 1) 

various editions of the Tischreden, so he also remembers two that came out in Leipzig, namely 1581 and 1621 jn Fol. and immediately adds: in ordinem redacta per D. Nicolaum Selneccerum, qui majorem etiam delectum adhibuit, adjecta vita Lutheri et appendice argumentorum quorumdam Christiane et utiliter ab eo explicatorum et admonitione de dictis quibusdam, quae Lutheri esse, non videnturr, which message can be improved and expanded in one and the other. For the edition that came to light in Leipzig in 1621 is not Selnecker's, but a new edition of the one that Stangwald was in charge of. In this edition, there is no information about Luther's life, and as far as the appendix is concerned, it is not only attached to the Selnecker edition, but also to other editions. On the same page, Walch states that the famous Leipzig theologian Adam Rechenberg, in his schediasmate historico de beati Lutheri colloquiis, declares the editions of 1581 and 1621 to be the best, mentions Selnecker's name in the former, but not Stangwald's name in the latter, nor that it had been printed several times before. Likewise, Johann Gottlieb Méller makes the same judgment about the 1581 edition, with Selnecker's name, but does not mention Stangwald's editions in his dissertation: de auctoritate scripti sub titulo: Lutheri colloquiorum mensalium in Germanico, Anglico et latino idiomate editi. Rostock. 1693. p. 6. 

Before the year 1591, Stangwald's name did not come to light, and only in the preface to the edition of that year, twenty years after the first edition of 1571, one year before Selnecker's death, does he for the first time refer to the edition of 1571 as his own. In contrast, in the three intervening. Sel-

The name of the editor is mentioned in each of Aurifaber's editions, 1577, 1580 and 1581. However, this was done only one year after Aurifaber's death, with Selnecker's remark that he published Aurifaber's collection, which he "has communicated to us". 

We cannot help but notice that it is very striking to us that Selnecker, one of the most famous Lutheran theologians, should have reprinted the work of Stangwald, a candidate of theology. Conversely, it would be much easier for us to understand. In our Opinion, we are dealing here not with two, but only with one redaction of the Tischreden. One edition is as similar to the other as one egg to the other. Everything we have written about Stangwald's edition applies equally to Selnecker's edition. 

Stangwald says in his preface of 1591: "But because the copies had all been sold, so that none could be obtained, | took the copy again at the suggestion of good friends and with the knowledge and approval of the Honorable Consistorii of Weymar" 2c. The first edition, differing in order from Aurifaber, appeared in 1571, without a name. The following three editions 1577, 1580, 1581 are, according to all testimonies, only a reprint of the edition of 1571, under Selnecker's name, and the edition of 1591 quite similar to the previous ones, except for Selnecker's preface, Selnecker's life of Luther and the pieces behind the appendix. From this we conclude that Stangwald's and Selnecker's 


editions are not two different editions, but only 


different imprints of the One Edition of 1571. The matter may perhaps lie like this: During Aurifaber's lifetime, Selnecker did not want to give his name to the altered Aurisaber edition, but put Stangwald in front. As soon as Aurifaber is dead, he appears in the following year, 1577, with his name. Fourteen years later, at Selnecker's advanced age, when he probably no longer wanted to deal with the publication of the Tischreden, Stangwald reappeared and gave his name in 1591,

also claims the edition of 1571 as his own. Whether 


the matter is one way or the other, factually it is certain Stangwald: 1700. 


that we are dealing with only one, not two different editions. Our assumption is also confirmed by the fact that Stangwald says: "Because all copies have been distributed, so that none more have been available", and he himself has not made the attempt to a new edition in the 20 years from 1571 to 1591. editions of Selnecker's edition were completely sold out during this time. Stangwald's first edition of 1571 will hardly have lasted that long. The version of the words in our edition of 1700: "und nachmals zu Leipzig etliche Mal gedruckt worden", seems to us to be much more appropriate to the circumstances than the one we find in the edition of 1591: "etliche mal nach gedruckt worden". These last words probably only mean "reprinted" because the supply was exhausted. Thus, the old famous theologians may be completely right in that they not only do not distinguish between Stangwald's and Selnecker's editions, but even, like Rechenberg and Fabricius, refer to the reprints of the 1591 edition, e.g., the print of 1621, as Selnecker's editions. 

For the sake of an easier overview, we give here a compilation of all known editions of the German Tischreden published before Walch.

For the first time in a complete edition of Luther's works, Walch's Table Talks are included.

Although the Wittenberg, Jenische and Eislebische parts were subsequently reprinted, they were not increased, and if this had been done, one might have had misgivings about including the said Tischreden.

Tischreden in the collection of Luther's writings, he writes the following in the last two paragraphs of his preface: "What finally prompted the present printing of Luther's Tischreden? 


Introduction. 


As far as this is concerned, | cannot help but be concerned that various people considered it questionable and thought it would be more advisable not to include such table speeches in this new collection of Luther's complete writings. For in this way, the work would not only be spread out even more, but it would also be given a reputation, as it were, as if it belonged to the true writings of Luther, since until now, there had been misgivings about assigning such a place to him. | also cannot deny that | myself was of this opinion, and if it had gone according to the same, then these table speeches would have been omitted. But since the work has already become more than too well known through the many editions and is in so many hands, since it cannot be denied to the blessed Luther, and since much good can be found in it, since enemies gain nothing against Luther and his teachings through what is offensive and questionable, as has been sufficiently demonstrated in the present preface, as well as previously by others: Indeed, since for this very reason, if it were now to be suppressed as it were, they would be likely to give rise to blasohemies, and since very many have soon expressly requested that they not be omitted from this collection, the publisher has been moved by this to undertake this new printing, and has believed that if it were omitted, the collection of Luther's writings would not be complete, in which | do not wish to oppose him. However, one does not take more part in it than that these table speeches are presented as they first came to light. They are considered no more than an appendix to Luther's writings and have therefore been placed in the last part of this collection. 

"The printing itself was not done according to the Stangwaldian or Selneckerian editions, but according to the Aurifabrian editions. This has been done for the following reasons: because in this collection of Luther's writings, one promised to deliver everything correctly according to the first editions; because the three editions differ noticeably from one another, and it would not have been practical to show such a difference at all times. 


35 


The reason for this is that much of what is subsequently included in these Table Talks is already found in other writings that are in this collection and would therefore have had to be included twice. In particular, the edition of 1568 has been used for the reprint, which is consistent with the first editions of 1566 and 1567. The content of each chapter has been placed in front of it, as was done previously with the other writings. The larger Latin passages have been translated into German, while the smaller ones have remained. The many errors found in the first editions have been improved. Some have thought that it would have been good if one had made notes about the oerter, in which something questionable and offensive occurred; however, one has found reservations about this, and thought that Luther had already been saved enough because of these table speeches. 

The title of this edition is: "D. Martin Luthers

Octav. With a preface by Jrmischer of XXXVII pages. In this preface, Jrmischer justifies himself because of the great similarity of his edition with that of Férstemann- Bindseil and gives p. XXXIV of the preface as the reason for it: Férstemann and Bindseil "applied a formal system of rules, where we merely continued to follow our simple general principles in the usual manner. That, therefore, the independence of our edition cannot be harmed by its similarity to that of Férstemann is, | hope, clear. A little earlier he says that he also had to "correct the biblical passages" and p. XXXV that he also compared Walch and Stangwald. 

Now we can return to the consideration of the Férstemann-Bindseil edition. 

In this edition, it is to be acknowledged that the comparison of Stangwald's and Selnecker's editions has really been done, which requires a laborious, lengthy work of which no one has a concept who has never done such things himself; it is to be regretted, however, that Férstemann and Bindseil have not made use of the good variants in these editions to improve Aurifaber's text from them. 

In view of the difficulty already mentioned in finding a piece of Aurifaber's edition in Stangwald's or Selnecker's, it is not surprising that Férstemann and Bindseil have not provided proof for a fairly large number of them.

where they are to be found in these editions. It is, however, surprising that the Erlangen edition has also not found one piece of those which are missing in Férstemann-Bindfeil - but which are nevertheless all in the Stangwald edition. From this, we must conclude that the editor of the Erlangen edition did not compare the Stangwald edition at all, but printed it from Férstemann-Bindseil. Such passages are the following: 1)

This proof is still strengthened by the fact that the Erlangen edition has reprinted all proofs, which Férstemann and Bindseil have indicated wrongly, likewise. This has taken place, for example, in the following places:

Introduction. 





In addition to the proofs provided by FérstemannBindseil from Stangwald's edition of 1603 and Selnecker's edition of 1581, the Erlangen edition has added the deviating leaf numbers of the editions of 1591 and 1577. This offered no difficulty in the otherwise quite identical editions, but was a purely mechanical work. 

Furthermore, Férstemann and Bindseil bring everything that deviates in Walch from the first Aurifaber edition, continuously through the entire work, as variants. This seems to us to be quite unjustified and it seems to us that it would have been better to leave these deviations completely unconsidered, because Walch did not want to deliver anything new, not even an improved edition, but only an improved edition.

print the edition of 1568. It is not customary to make the printing errors the subject of continuous variants and marginal notes. The variants could only concern carelessness, misprints and _ accidental small improvements. Nevertheless, Fdérstemann and Bindseil have recorded all the variants found in Walch. The complete comparison of Walch had to 


serve to insert the biblical passages from Walch, 


which was also done in such a way that all of Walch's printing errors, with the exception of six, have been transferred to the Férstemann-Bindseil edition. The Erlangen edition has faithfully reprinted all the printing errors from the Férstemann-Bindseil edition. These are the following:

Lauterbach made this last mistake and it runs through all the issues. 

It follows from the foregoing that Forste mann- Bindseil and the Erlangen edition do not look up the biblical passages.

A printing error in the biblical quotations is peculiar to the Férstemann-Bindseil edition; the Erlanger has reprinted it: 

Joh. 5, 18. instead of Joh. 3, 18. F.-B. 111, 406. Erl. A. 61, 89. From this follows: the Erlangen edition has direct from the Bible also not One

Accordingly, it will probably follow that the Erlangen edition did not compare Walch, but reprinted everything related to Walch from Férstemann-Bindseil. 

The Férstemann-Bindseil edition has from Cap. 28 to 31 incl. inverted counting, both in the text and in the registers; for Cap. 27 is set twice, once correctly, the other time incorrectly above Cap. 28, and then continues in the wrong counting until Cap. 31. 31. the superscription

but reprinted from Walch. 

The Férstemann-Bindseil edition improved the following six printing errors in Walch; the Erlanger reprinted these six improvements: 


Walch XXII, 2184. F.-B.1V,500. — Erl. ed. 62, 239. 957. "Il, 351. ™ 59, 161. 449. "|, 358. ™ 58, 73. 1215. "111, 103. ™ 60, 84. 766. "Il, 198. " 58, 406. 1595. "4111, 395. "61, 74. 


The book is not corrected in any place, but the few improvements from  FérstemannBindseil are reprinted. 

The following variants, mostly from Walch, are incorrectly given in Férstemann - Bindseil and also reprinted in the Erlangen edition:

of Cap. 32 is then correct again. Quite the same in the Erlangen edition, in the text and in the registers. From this we would almost like to conclude that the Erlangen edition has not printed its text from the first Aurifaber edition, but from Férstemann-Bindseil. This assumption gains probability from the fact that the Erlangen edition vol. 58, 258, Cap. 11, § 14, Walch XLII, Col. 628, refers to Aurifaber's note as Férstemann's note.

Introduction. 





Only one case has struck us in the Erlangen edition, where the same does not include an error of Férstemann-Bindseil, namely vol. 57, 105, note 5. The F.-B.'sche edition vol. |, 81, has noted note 4, in relation to Walch's translation from the 2nd Psalm: "IV. und die Herzen (!) rathschlagen mit einander." There the Erlangen edition offers "gentlemen" as Walch really has it at that point. Férstemann had not read well. Such an obvious printing error, even if it had been there, should nevertheless have been let slip without an exclamation mark. But also in other places such printing errors are emphasized by exclamation marks, e.g. F.-B. Vol. |, 24, Note | "thatliches"; W. gives instead "tédtliches"! 

The Férstemann-Bindseil edition has a large number of quite useless e.r variants: 

FB. 

I, 27 datauf lieget instead of: lieget darauf. 

I, 40 one shall instead of: shall one. 

I, 45 Doctor Martinus Luther once said instead: Once said D. M. Luther. 

I, 52 without fruit not instead: not without fruit. 

I, 64 since they nevertheless the Aristotle instead: since they the Aristotle nevertheless. 

idid. him the sophists instead: the sophists him. 

I, 318 Affects instead of: Affectus. 

I, 322 remain seated instead of: remain seated. 

I, 323 St. Paul instead: Paul. 

I, 324 Christos instead of: Christ. 

I, 328 the letters instead: Letters. 

I, 336 shall go over it instead of: shall go over it. 

The advantage in these insignificant variants is usually on the side of Walch, who, without changing anything essential’, has mostly made the language somewhat smoother than it is found in Aurifaber. It should be noted that the variants listed are taken by us at random from a small circle, namely F:-B. Bd. |, 27-64, and |, 318-336. Many hundreds of similar variants are noted by F.-B.. The Erlangen edition has omitted quite a number of these useless variants. 

Neither F.-B. nor the Erlangen editions have accepted any of Walch's variants, even when an incorrectness is palpably improved, as in Cap. 43, § 115, where Walch, according to the sense, has written "not" instead of "also". Cf. F.-B. IV, 106, note 1, and Erl. Ausg. 61, 248, note 2. 


That Férstemann and Bindseil did not make use of the HallischeHandschrift 1) to improve and correct Aurifaber's text is no longer surprising to us after we have become acquainted with it in Bindseil's Latin edition. Both the Hallische Handschrift and Rebenstock are, as we have shown above, just as much, if not worse, corrupted and contaminated with additions, bad readings and changes than the German editions. 


D. The English translation. 


In 1652, an English translation of the Table Talks appeared in folio under the following title: "Dris Martini Lutheri Colloquia Mensalia, or Divine Discourses at his Table, etc. . . . Collected first together by D* Antonius Lauterbach, and afterward disposed into certain Common places by John Aurifaber Dr in Divinitie. Translated but of the high Germane into the English Tongue by Capt. Henrie. Bell. . . London, Printed by William Du Gard, dwelling in Suffolk-lane near London-stone. 1652." Folio. 541 pp. 20 leaves of dedication, prefaces, index 2c. Dedicates: "To the Right Hpnorable John Hendrick Lord Major, The Right Worshipful the Sheriffs and Aldennen, the Common Council and the other Worthie Senatore and Citizens of the famous Citie of London", signed by Thomas Thorowgood. The preface comprises 9 pages and contains remarks against the Papists and praises of Luther taken from the writings of the Calvinists. From p. 11 on is "Capitain Henrie Bell's Narrati ve or Relation of the miraculous preserving of Dr. Martin Lutheri Book, entituled Colloquia Mensalia", dated July 1650. From this narrative, which appears quite fabulous, Walch has given the essentials in his preface p. 15 ff, § XII. We do not consider it necessary to repeat it here. On p. 14 is the verdict of Charls Herle and Edw. Corbett, who were also ordered to censor the book, dated November 10, 1646: "We find many excellent things are conteined in

English translation with the Frankfurt edition of 1569.

Then follows a testimony from Aurifaber's preface and three letters from Protestant clergymen about Luther's Table Talks, and finally the English translation of Aurifaber's preface complete on 9 sheets, along with a sheet index of the 80 sections of the Table Talks in the same order as Aurifaber. Now follows the work itself and finally the prophecies of Luther collected by Georg Walther. From this last appendix of the prophecies, it can be concluded that the English translation will be made according to the Frankfurt edition of 1569, which is presumably to be considered a reprint. The prophecies are attached only to this edition and to the later so-called Stangwald editions of 1700 and 1723. This edition was published again in London in 1791 in folio.

Thus, we can now proceed to the consideration of the nature of the table speeches. It is not necessary to separate the external from the internal characteristics, because the presentation of the former will also make the latter completely clear. 


Duplicates in the table talks. 


Through all previous editions of the Tischreden, without exception, from the first, the Aurifabersche, in 1566 to the last, the Erlanger, in 1854, there are a very large number of duplicates, now already 320 years. The number of duplicates, from which we have freed

Introduction. 





The first part of the text is the first part of a paragraph, and the last part is not the same as the first part of a paragraph or paragraph. In the writings from which they are taken, these pieces rarely form the beginning of a paragraph, nor does the conclusion of them coincide with the conclusion of a paragraph or section, but they are usually torn out of the middle of a section, and the paragraphs are divided differently, which makes them very difficult to find. 

The Stangwald and Selnecker editions are advantageously different from the Aurifaber editions in this respect, for they have 146 fewer duplicates than the latter. Also, in those editions, a large number of pieces that Aurifaber inserted from Luther's writings into the Table Talks are removed from the Table Talks and placed in the appendix with an indication of the writings from which they are taken. Walch and the later editions have not made use of this really significant improvement. Urged only by his publisher to include the Tischreden in his collection, Walch did not want to bother with an editing and improvement of the Tischreden. FérstemannBindseil referred to the duplicate only in 84 pieces that they recognized as duplicate by comparing Stangwald's and Selnecker's, but only in five of them did they decide to omit them. Férstemann and Bindseil did not notice 56 of the duplicates omitted by Stangwald and Selnecker, although several of them refer to the same place in Stangwald, e.g. to 





Cap. 27, § 43 and Cap. 32, 811  aauf8t . 350*. "45, § 24. 76, § 27(2). 483. 45,§47 "73, § 12a 472. 48, §2 " 38, $8 5" 534, 48,§40 "" 38,§7 534. "61,86 "7, § 104 "" 524% Of these 84 pieces, 9 are also duplicated by Stangwald. 


The Erlangen edition, on the other hand, has reinserted all duplicates. Only in 9 places, according to the F.-B. edition, it has referred to duplicates. Yes, the inattention of the editor of the Erlangen edition goes so far that e.g. the 


S. 152 "" 27, 8 64 


second paragraph of Cap. 61, § 10, which is another relation of Cap. 26, § 52, is printed again in its entirety in the latter place as a note. Likewise compare Cap. 22, § 151 and Cap. 48, § 2, where in the Erlangen edition to each of these two different relations the deviations of the others are printed as notes, thus one and the same thing is actually reproduced four times. Such a thing is repeated even more often, e.g. Cap. 20, § 14 and Cap. 1, § 89, in general almost every time when the notes referring to Stangwald assume a larger extent, e.g. Cap. 20, § 29 compared with Cap. 20, § 4; Cap. 27, § 95 compared with Cap. 22, § 104 etc. yi. Walch left out only 5 pieces: 


Cap. 15, § 21a, because already Cap. 15, § 10. 76, 810a, 4,856. 74, 8 33a, TA, 8 3. 43, 8 55a, 43, 8 68. 


and the long note, which the Ert. Ausg" vol. 60, 18 f. to Cap. 24, 8 74, Walch did not bring, because already printed Walch, alteAusg., Bd. IX, 1421. 

A large number of these pieces are already duplicated, as different relations, which completely cover each other in thought, in the sources themselves, namely in the diary of Cordatus, from No. 1770 on. We have not included them, because we considered them dispensable due to the great similarity with their doppelgangers. 

We have not printed the following numbers from Cordatus: No. 31, because contained in Lauterbach pag. 19; further, because duplicated in Cordatus itself: No. 1124. 1267. 1356. 1365. 1393. 1412. 1442-1449 (Melanchthon's letter to Brenz). 1450 (Luther's addition to the previous letter. Walch, old ed.,XXl, 1349). 1439. 1620. 1677. 1715. 1770. 1771. 1772. 1773-1780. 1783-1814. 1816-1825. - To be found in other writings 359-362. 1186-1192. Not suitable for communication No. 614. So there are altogether 85 pieces of the 1843 numbers of the Cordatus, of which we have made no use. 

At Lauterbach are only two duplicates namely:

As this register shows, 16 of the 39 duplicates in the Hall manuscript are also duplicates in the German Tischreden, of all those in Rebenftock only 13, i.e. just one third. The duplicates in Rebenftock are almost all small and insignificant, mostly only other redactions. The duplicate Bindseil |, 68 and Il, 367 can hardly be named in the same way in Rebenftock, because it is only hinted at, but not widely executed, as in Bindseil. This makes us inclined to attribute priority to the Rebenftock collection over the Héllische manuscript. 

We consider it superfluous to print here the register of the 520 duplicates we have proved in the German Tischreden, because 


we have accounted for every omission of any piece and provided the necessary proof. Such an index 


would fill 12 entire columns of our edition. 

We have already spoken above about the presumed cause of the duplicate in Cordatus. 

In the Tischreden, the same pieces are often assigned to different sections at the same time. By combining related material and reducing the number of chapters from 80 to 43, Slangwald noticed the 146 duplicates from which he has removed from the Tischreden. 

The difference of the duplicate of a- 


44 


Introduction. 





other often comes from the fact that they are different translations, e.g. Cap. 4, § 34, and 15, § 17; Cap. 1, § 18 and 4, § 35. 

More often, through inattention, such repetitions are also found in the same section, e.g., Cap. 15, § 6 and 15, § 39; Cap. 15, § 10 and-15, § 21." 

Frequently, different relations that completely coincide with each other, e.g., Cap. 27, § 36 is found three more times, namely Cap. 30, § 5; Cap. 56, § 4 and Cap. 56, § 9. Of these we have retained Cap. 56, § 4, authenticated by Lauterbach p. 174, and Cap. 27, § 36, authenticated by Cordatus No. 643. 

Other miscellaneous relations, one of which is dispensable, include the beginning of Cap. 15, §12, and the last paragraph of Cap. 12, §35; Cap. 4, §33, Cap. 13, §72, and Cap. 21, § 1 (Cordatus No. 1631); the second paragraph of Cap. 4, §78 and the last paragraph of Cap. 15, §19 (Lauterbach pag. 21). 

Even some of the pieces taken from Luther's own writings are found twice, e.g., Cap. 17, § 22 and Cap. 19, §25 from the Great Catechism. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, 130, § 232; Cap. 6, § 5, para. 3 and 8, § 8, last para. from the Kirchenpostille. Walch, St. Louis ed. vol. XIII, 674, § 25; cap. 24, § 35 and 7, § 130 from Interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians Cap. 1. Walch, old edition, vol. VM, §§ 87. 88. 

We are firmly convinced that, despite all our efforts, we have not succeeded in freeing the Tischreden from all the pieces that Aurifaber has inserted from other writings of Luther, but that quite a number of such passages can still be found. Pieces of which we assume that they can still be found in other writings are, for example, Cap. 2, § 84, of the provision; Cap. 10, § 4 and § 10, of free will; Cap. 11, § 11 and § 12, of the 1st commandment; Cap. 12, .§§ 77-82, the law does not serve for justification; Cap. 17, § 23, of baptism, and others. 

To make it clear to the reader how immensely altered the appearance of the Tischreden is in our edition by omitting the duplicates and pieces taken from other writings of Luther, we give 


the proof about it at Cap. 12, "of the law and Evangelio". At the same time, we indicate the sources from which pieces are newly translated. Where the pieces omitted from Luther's writings are to be found, can be found in the relevant paragraphs in our edition. The paragraphs marked f in the front are omitted.

In this chapter, 36 paragraphs had to be deleted, partly because they are duplicates, partly because they are taken from other writings of Luther. Paragraphs 26. 35. 43. 44. 46. 83. 84 are also duplicates, which are not deleted here, but in other chapters. If all these pieces were here 





Furthermore, other paragraphs than the ones we have indicated may have been taken from other writings of Luther, e.g., §§ 77-82, which are often repeated in Luther's great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians. 26 paragraphs of this section have been newly translated by us according to the originals. Thus, only 24 paragraphs remain in their old form. 


Admixture of foreign things. 


In the collection of table speeches there is a rather large number of pieces that are not table speeches. We are not talking here about the pieces that Aurifaber took from Luther's writings and trimmed to make them appear as table speeches, but about those that openly stand out as strange pieces. It was already in the plan of the first collectors to include not only table speeches in the narrower sense, but also advice, concerns, consolations, letters, rhymes, interpretations of sayings, and so on. We encounter such things already, though rarely, in Cordatus and Lauterbach; much more in Rebenstock and the Hall manuscript; in considerable numbers, however, in the German Tischreden, including those that are not by Luther at all. Stangwald and Selnecker have relegated such things to their appendix. We, too, have not wanted to proceed too radically with these things, but have omitted only those pieces in which Luther obviously has no part, such as Melanchthon's letter to Brenz, and those which are already printed in other volumes of Luther's works. The others we have retained, namely because otherwise no place would have been found for their inclusion in Luther's writings and some of them are nevertheless very valuable and instructive, such as Luther's disputation with Melanchthon on justification, Cap. 13, §§ 2-11., This piece we have even newly translated from Oeem Latin, because the Aurifaber translation was not sufficient. Which of these pieces we have retained, and which we have omitted, may be found in the paragraphs concerned. They are the following:

That these assumptions of ours are not made up out of thin air, but have good reason, will be seen immediately from the following. 


Arbitrary treatment of the originals in the table speeches. 


In the table speeches, the originals have been dealt with in a highly arbitrary manner and much has been fictionalized. 

Cap. 2, § 17, Vine I, 3a. Zd, Bindseil |,%. 6, compared with Cordatus No. 517, offer, as D. Wrampelmeyer correctly remarks, a_ rather characteristic example of the way in which the original form of Luther's words is distorted by later additions and alterations. 


From Cordatus No. 435, a single sentence, Aurifaber has spun two whole paragraphs, namely Cap. 7, §§80 and 81; Bindseil III, 37, on the other hand, gives only the first half of the sentence in Cordatus. 

From Cordatus No. 1208, two and a half rows, Aurifaber has made the extensive first paragraph of Cap. 19, § 26. 

Cap. 24, § 115 Aurifaber tells that one fainted in the presence of Luther, while according to Cordatus No. 453 Luther himself was afflicted by it. On this occasion, a whole consolation speech to the sick person is invented from the thoughts with which Luther comforted himself. 

In Cap. 26, § 52, what was reported by Cordatus No. 1129 is illustrated by a set of 


Introduction. 47 





Additions brought to about four times the size. 

Cap. 43, § 13, the last three paragraphs, Luther's words are horribly distorted. Cf. Cordatus No. 1513. 

In Cap. 66, § 48, Cordatus No. 649, how the nobility deals with theologians and jurists, is transformed into a dispute of theologians and jurists. 

From Cordatus No. 1097, One Paragraph, Cap. 74, § 2 three paragraphs are made. 

Cordatus No. 555 has become more than threefold in Cap. 76, § 3. 

In Cap. 3, § 14, No. 1761-1763 of the Cordatus are interwoven, rearranged, changed and provided with various additions. 

An interesting example of how the originals were 

handled in the Tischreden is provided by Cap. 9, § 19 and 44, § 3, which are based on Cordatus No. 1743. 1745 and 734. Also included in these two paragraphs are Cap. 9, § 45 and § 46; Cap. 50, § 2; Cap. 2, § 42; Cap. 11, § 16;.Cap. 2, § 61; Cap. 37, § 100; Cap. 44, § 3, and similarly Cap. 37, § 75. Of these 11 pieces, 8 had to be deleted. The above information contains only a few samples of the deviation of the table speeches from the originals. The deviations from the records of Lauterbach are by far not as substantial as those of Cordatus. Nevertheless, what D. Wrampelmeyer has said in his preface p. 30 f. about this in relation to Cordatus, also finds its full application to the table speeches after Lauterbach, namely: "In many cases, the version of the Latin and German records is similar. This similarity, of course, almost never goes so far that one could speak of a _ literal correspondence of the Latin table speeches or claim that a paragraph of the German table speeches is similar. 


German Table Speeches. Cap. 3, § 28: the Jewish countryside 


: India. (Kummer at Lauterbach psA. 87.) 


The author of the book, the author of the "Cordatus", states that "the Cordatus Table Talks are a faithful translation of a Latin text on which they are based. "It is hardly possible to think of a greater contrast than that which exists between Cordatus and the later Tischreden in the material that has been handed down together. Those who compiled the Latin and German table speeches allowed themselves the greatest arbitrary wedges. They tore the original records apart, arranged the material under general categories and provided the individual sections with content, not infrequently with omissions and concealment of important data and facta. This was done to a particularly rich extent in the compilation of the German Tischreden. This procedure, however, has had bad consequences. In part, what belongs together has been torn apart, in part, it has led to superfluous repetitions on a large scale. Thus we are confronted with the phenomenon that, especially in the German table speeches, a lot of conversations occur twice, not infrequently three times and more. In fact, the mass of the actual repetitions is so great that after eliminating them, the volume of the German table speeches would probably melt down to half." 1) 

By tearing apart the original records, one felt compelled to make new connections, to form introductions and conclusions, and to make other additions, some of which are correct, however, others are demonstrably wrong. 


Spoiled state of the table talks, 


With regard to the Latin editions of the Table Talks, we have already demonstrated that they have a very corrupted text. Some false readings of the Table Talks run through all editions, e.g.: - 


BixdseU. Ill, 77. 


"45, § 24: not much without blood instead of: not long in bloom; wrong also in Lauterbach paZ. 176. i, 352. cf. cap. 76, § 27, para. 2. Stangwald 


omitted the word. 


"75, K 1, para. 11 a. E.: by a pious man instead of: by a bad boy. (Cord. No. 1600.) I, 398. " 76, § 28, par. 2, middle: Bride instead of: prokunci 


sdepth of the seaj. (Cord. No. 1556.) ' 


"77, § 1, penultimate par.: gegen Abend instead of: gegen Morgen. (Lauterbach xaZ. 36.) 


111, 107. 1, 165. 





1) This assumption seems too high to us. What we have eliminated, is, according to our surplus, about one sixth. With knowledge and will, we have not left much in the way of actual repetitions, and what we have missed will probably not be significant. 


48 


Introduction. 


Other false readings run through all German editions, again confirming their complete dependence on Aurifaber. This is the case, for example: 


Cap. 3, § 22: Lock legs instead of: SchooBbeine. Cord. No. 704. 


" 


7, § 17 towards the end: prior instead of: Priest. Lauterbach pn.]. 45.

" 39, § 12: Scorpion [scorpio] instead of: Ostrich [struthio]. Cord. No. 230. 

" 43, § 183: India instead of: Italia. Cord. No. 1538. Stangwald omitted the word. 

"48, § 17, para. 1 End: Altvater instead of: Adam. Lauterb. 104. 

"48, § 25: Monks instead of: Dying. Kummer at Lauterb. pag. 202. 

"54, § 27 Last paragraph: Johann XIII. instead: Johann XXIII Lauterb. pag. 83. 

" 57, § 4, 2 rows are omitted, one in the middle, the other towards the end. Lauterb. pag. 192. "69, § 3, para. I, end: drunkenness instead of: Dryness. Lauterbach pag. 184. 

"70, § 2, para. 4: they [the Sternes have to sue instead of: we have to sue. Cord. No. 169. "75, § 1, para. 11 Begin: on loud wars [militia] instead of: loud malice [malitia]. Cord. No. 1599. "76, § 4, para. 1 middle: more miserable instead of: more internal. Lauterb. pag. 10. 

"76, § 16, sub. 2: Willows instead: Waid sFarbekraut): Lauterb. pag. 185. 





In quite a few cases, Stangwald has chosen duplicates that contain the correct reading, e.g. Aurifaber: Cap. 3, § 60: violence; Stangw.: has will [gewollt.] Cord. No. 949. cf. cap. 43, § 158." 24, § 117: klage. Stangw.: schlage. 


Cord. No. 654. cf. cap. 26, § 27. 


In other places, Stangwald noticed that not everything was in order, and then tried to put an end to the difficulty by circumventing it, e.g. 


Aurifaber: Cap. 43, § 33: D. Phil., Lauterbach pas. 133: D. Pistor. Stangw.: N. N. 


"66, § 25: da fehlet euch Wahrheit. Lauterbach pag. 46: Das fehlet euch. - Truth 2c. Stangwald has omitted here the word truth, which belongs to the following, as we have already seen above twice that he has omitted the word that is burdensome to him. 


Stangwald has actually corrected the following passages, for example: 


Aurifaber: Cap. 37, § 114: Oil. Stangwald: Eel. "" 45, § 70:Opinions, Stangwald: Meiningen. ""55, § § 7:Loss. Stangwald: Unlust. Lauterb. pnA. 56. "" 74, § 6:Ueberwaschung. Stangwald: Ueberwachsung. U. a. m. 


In his preface p. 33, Wrampelmeyer has named a whole number of wrong readings in the table speeches. 


Incorrect timing.’ 


Very often there are wrong time indications in the table speeches, even more often the time indications made in the originals are omitted.

With a small piece we want to show the reader an example of the changes that the Tischreden have undergone through the various editors: 

Lauterbach, pag. 174: Deinde legit in libro Campani, propria manu scripto et Mun- steri reperto, cujus titulus erat etc. (After that he read in the book of Campanus, which he had written with his own hand and which had been found at Minster, whose title was 2c.). 

Bindseil II, 30: D. Martinus Luthel-us librum Campani legens manu ejus propria subscripta et Munsterii, cujus titulus erat etc. (Since D. M. Luther read the book of Campanus, which was signed by his own hand and by that of Munster, its title was 2c.). 

Rebenstock II, 33 a: D. M. L. librum Campani legens, manu illius propria scriptum et a Munstero relictum, cujus titulus erat etc. (Since D. M. L. read the book of Campanus, which he had written with his own hand and which Munster had left behind, its title was 2c.). 

Aurifaber, cap. 37, § 6: D. Martinus Lutherus read in the Campani book, which he had written with his own hand and had overlooked and crossed out Munsterus, which title was 2c. Likewise Stangwald. 

Aurifaber, Cap. 2, §39: As he was reading in the book of Campani, the gusher, so he was with 


1) In order to understand how it was possible that the editors of the Tischreden made a person out of the city of Minster, one must note that "Sebastian Munster" attacked Luther because of his translation of the Bible, in that he wanted to judge everything according to grammatical rules. Cf. Lauterbach's Tageb. paz. In our edition: Appendix 1, No. 106. 


of his own hand, the title was 2c. (Here "Munster." is missing.) This last redaction is missing in Stangwald, who has omitted it as a duplicate. 

In a large number of pieces, it can be seen that the editors did not even replace them, e.g., Cap. 24, § 123, cf. with Cord. No. 86; 23, § 2, cf. with Latterb. pag. 137; 14, § 21, cf. with Cord. No. 320. 321; 26, § 42, cf. with Lauterb. pag. 34; Cap. 12, § 23, cf. with Cord. No. 74. 75; 43, § 75, cf. with Cord. No. 35 and 38; 21, § 17, cf. with Cord. No. 1703. 1704; 7, § 148, cf. with Lauterb. pag. 69; 7, § 98, cf. with Cord. No. 48; 7, § 9, cf. with Cord. No. 42; 1, § 54, cf. with Cord. No. 1568; 7, § 152, cf. with Cord. No. 519; 19, § 4, cf. with Cord. No. 1350. In other ones, the straight opposite is reported of what the sources bring, e.g. 26, § 30, para. 1: Therefore come to me, my dear Schlainhauffen, item to Magister Philippo, Co.rdato 2c. In contrast, Cordatus No. 378, the challenged one is directed away from Philippus and Cordatus, to Christo. - Cap. 27, § 15 itis said that "the pope made an alliance with the emperor," while Cordatus No. 609 reports that the pope made an alliance with the emperor's enemy, the king of France’- Cap. 48, § 30, the Latin words are the exact opposite of Cordatus No. 1311. The "not" is omitted. - In Cordatus No. 1252, private citizens and authorities are placed "opposite" each other; in the corresponding paragraph of the Table Talks, Cap. 44, §§ 7. 8, both are blended and drawn together.

Cap. 19, § 25, Walch, St. Louis ed. vol. X, 137, § 246 and 130, § 232, is from the Great Catechism, but prefaced, "It was asked." 

Cap. ‘I8, § 12, Walch, St. Louis ed. vol. X, 2158, § 1-8, is from the brief instruction on how to confess. 

Cap. I, § 61, Walch, old ed. vol. VIII, Cap. 2, § 55. 56. 63. 67. 68, is from the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, but introduced: "D. Luther sagete.”

Credibility of Table Talks. 


Not all information even from the first recorders of the Table Talks is completely reliable. Cordatus No. 338 has quite a number of erroneous statements about? Incidents from Luther's life. The name of Luther's mother is incorrectly given, Hanna instead of Margaretha, the year of Luther's birth is only corrected by an old hand, probably from 1484 to 1483, the time of the omission of the theses is set in the year 1516 instead of 1517, the time of the first papal bull of excommunication in the year 1519 instead of 1518, as it is correctly stated in Cord. No. 569 is correctly stated. 

In No. 343, Cordatus says that Luther omitted his theses in the second year after he became a doctor, even though Luther had already received his doctorate in 1512. The same error is also found by Kummer in Lauterbach pag. 102. - In N6. 930 it is stated that Luther became a doctor in his 27th year, instead of in his 29th year, cf. Cord. No. 892. 

Cord. No. 632 the relation is in several details different from what Luther himself writes to Amsdorf in 1525, 1) 2000 florins instead of 4000 florins at Cordatus. The latter does not state that Luther had the Polish Jew imprisoned, which is stated in this letter as well as in the letter to Spalatin 2), and that Luther had him set free because he did not want him to be martyred. 

Therefore, we should not be surprised that we encounter many more and grosser errors among the later collectors of the Table Talks. We know that Luther had five living children, namely John, Martin, Paul and Magdalena. Elisabeth, about one year old, died again on August 3, 1528. Rebenstock, however, lets Luther himself tell in a conversation, which falls into the year 1532, and where Cordatus speaks only of three children, that he had six children.

he did not keep the slightest selectum, but gathered together everything

Introduction. 





is emphatically taught about the Roman Antichrist and the Pabstacy is presented in its right form. From time to time, many serious and moving admonitions and warnings are given. The book can be read and used with benefit; it serves not only for learning, but also for edification. Andreas Stangwald 1) presents this with several others, and adds: It can be said without falsehood that in these miscellanea the whole Christian doctrine is abundantly, brightly and clearly set forth, so that in it every Christian can have rich and full instruction of all that he needs to know for his soul's bliss. Johann Aurifaber notes exactly this, and Nicolaus Selnecker says that there are many great teachings, spirit and comfort in these table speeches, so that one must hold it in high esteem." 

Then Walch defends Luther against the accusation that he spoke too disdainfully of some books of the Holy Scriptures and of the church teachers, "and then continues: 

B XXVII: "Thirdly, | add that even if one encounters one and the other in Luther's table speeches that one cannot approve of and endorse per se, he is nevertheless to be excused for this reason, or nothing is to be proven against his person and teaching. This remark is also of such a nature that it is based on good reasons. Blessed Luther was a human being and the grace of God, which proved itself in him powerfully, did not go any extraordinary ways with him, which made him not only gradually enlightened and sanctified, but also constantly clung to human errors and weaknesses, and he therefore spoke and did many things that did not come from the spirit of God dwelling in him, but from flesh and blood, and from the remnants of his corrupt nature. He himself knew this very well and confessed it freely. He says in one place: 2) In St. Augustine's office 


1) In his attribution of the Table Talks. 


In the books one finds many sayings that flesh and blood have spoken, and | must also confess of myself that | speak many words that are not God's words when | speak outside the preaching ministry, at home over the table, or otherwise. He had spoken and written many things in the heat, which he later recognized as a mistake and complained about it. In another place, he remembers how he puts down on paper in a few words one thing and another that he has in mind, so that he does not forget it: There are in them (as we are human beings) such things as are human, even tasting of the flesh. For when we are alone and disputing, we are also often angry; and God laughs at our excellent wisdom, with which we show ourselves whimsical before him; only believe that he also delights in such of his fools, who teach him how to rule, which | have not seldom done and still often do." 


§ XXVIII: "Out of such human weakness, or out of the corruption of a lively, bright, and hot temper, some of Luther's speeches have flowed, which, considered in themselves, are not to be condoned; but he is to be excused. For if he sometimes made joking speeches; if he used an expression that does not completely correspond to decency, he did not do so out of a special inclination to what is dishonorable and indecent, but out of carelessness and thus indicated that he was a human being. It remains to be seen whether all idioms, words and expressions really flowed out of his mouth as they were distinguished by his table companions and other acquaintances and subsequently made common through printing. Thus, here too, one must not lose sight of the nature of the time in which he lived. The way of speaking

and writing was much harder then than it is now. That which is called decent is changeable. Herr von Seckendorf 1) says: multa verba et dicteria, quae hodie vilia aut spurca habentur, illo tempore sine turpitudine dici poterant et inter facetias non inhonestas locum habebant, quod ex collatione veterum et recentiorum librorum haud _ difficulter demonstrari posset. Many times it happened that Luther showed his zeal against shameful things, and then he thought that it was not necessary for him to measure the words according to the art, not to think how Luther's enemies often took them out of context and twisted them in many ways." 

Wrampelmeyer in his preface p. 37 says: "Also the reproach could be made to the records of Cordatus that they contain just like the later table speeches some coarse, for us offensive. Of course, they do not contain as much offensiveness as the Latin and German table speeches, but at least enough. Here we' certainly must not apply the standard of the present time. Luther's manner has certainly often not been a fine one. But he speaks the language of his people and of his time, and at that time people not only did not take offense at such expressions, but even counted them among the good jokes." Further, in the third note to No. 124 of Cordatus: "Such expressions of Luther's prove very often in the German table speeches, in the pieces which transmit them together with Cordatus, to be later additions not originating from Luther." .. . "The strongest such expressions tend as a rule to occur in Luther only," . "when he wishes to lend the strongest expression to his abhorrence of the devil, his instruments and works." To this we have to add: At that time, when a court jester could put something in his prince's boots and then, to the general amusement of the people, could excuse himself with impunity by saying that a little bird had done it 2), many things were considered proper that are judged quite differently in our time. Therefore, one should not be surprised if such things happen to us. 


1) In 6i8tor. 6ut6. likr. Ill, § 134, n. 643. 2) Bindseil I, 250. 


Offensive things also occur here and there in the table speeches. By our standards, indecency is found several times, but in our edition, which has been renewed according to the originals, not nearly as much as in the old editions; however, Luther never contains anything truly indecent, no matter how much his enemies would like to burden him with it. 

Some people also take offense at some of Luther's harsh statements. Often Luther speaks very harshly about the peasants, as well as about burghers and nobles. That in this Luther, who calls himself the son of a farmer, is not a haughty contempt of honest classes, especially the peasantry, but the expression of the truth: "that the more blessings God pours out on people, the more ungrateful they are," is evident from what we read in Cordatus No. 700, in our Table Talks Cap. 4, §20: "Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jsaat were not only farmers and tillers of the soil, but also theologians, for the Scripture says (Gen. 24, 63.) that Isaac went into his field to signify the gifts of GOD and the creatures that are perceived in the field." 

According to this, Luther also declares our faithful, godly peasants to be theologians who do not fall under his harsh judgments. 

Something similar is laid down by Walch in his preface in the 29th paragraph. Then he continues in § XXX: "The enemies and the ill-minded can carefully read out of the Table Talks everything that, according to their imagination, serves against the blessed Luther, and therefore take the opportunity to blaspheme and slander in many ways; but if they wanted to show themselves honest and impartial, then they should not forget the many good and useful things that are in it, and for this reason let both Luther himself and the book receive what is right and fair. This must be done here all the more, because one finds far more to praise than to blame in this work. Nicolaus Selnecker 3) writes, not without good reason: "It is a sin and a disgrace that the unholy slanderers have come out of a great, beautiful, excellent garden,

Our issue. 


We have removed 520 "duplicates" from the Table Talks, which are found partly in the Table Talks themselves and partly elsewhere in Luther's writings. 

The diaries of Cordatus and Lauterbach are entirely translated by us from Latin and included in our edition. 

In the diary of Cordatus there are 1843 numbers i total. Of these, 1031 are included in the Table Talks 727 in Appendix No. II; not used because Duplicat 2c., 85 numbers. 

Lauterbach has a total of 488 numbers. Of these 356 numbers are housed in the Tischreden, 127 i Appendix No. |.; 5 numbers are not used. Of these two are duplicates, two are not by Luther, and on number is not suitable for sharing. 

From sorrow 24 pieces are placed in the tabl speeches. 

All Bible passages are looked up and many othe errors are improved.

In the case of a number of other pieces, which are also separate, the transfer was not necessary because, as often happens in conversations, there was no internal connection. 

Only one heading has been changed by us, Cap. 39, § 12 after Cord. No. 230, where the manuscript offers struthio, not scorpio. 

Some pieces are given by us twice, both according to the redaction of Lauterbach and according to that of Cordatus, namely Cap. 3, § 16; Cap. 27, § 11 and 30, § 10; Cap. 27, § 36 and 56, § 4; Cap. 43, § 63 and Cap. 62, § | and 75, § 2. 

Twice, according to Cordatus and Kummer, we have communicated: Cap. 4, § 82 and 24, § 59: Cap. 15, § 11 and Cap. 2, § 121; Cap. 22, § 6; Cap. 22, § 12 and 73, § 14; Cap. 73, § 17; Cap. 75, § 1; Cap. 76, § 23.

1. from the holy Biblia. 


The venerable Doctor Martin Luther once said to Philippo Melanchthon, item to Doctor Justo Jonah and others, about the Biblia or Holy Scripture, that it was like a very large forest, in which there were many and all kinds of trees, from which one could break off many kinds of fruit. For in the Biblia one would have abundant comfort, teaching, instruction, admonition, warning, promise and prophecy 2c. But there is not a tree in this forest on which he has not knocked and broken and shaken off a few apples or pears. 1)

time, and now in our time, and has been spread more widely than

94. How God spoke to the fathers. 

95. how the world wants to abolish and settle the division in religious matters. 

That the divine Word and the Christian Church may be preserved from the raging of the world. 





2. proof that the Bible is the Word of God. (Cordatus No. 410 and No. 1345. 2) 


The Bible is a book with which God misleads the world. But it is wonderful that God has protected this book, as well as His Church. But just as the devil has killed many saints whom we do not know, so no doubt God has caused many good books from the Bible to perish, of which we do not know. 

That the Bible is God's Scripture is proven by the fact that everything in it is written by Moses as it goes and stands in the 


2) Aurifaber had torn No. 1345 apart and placed No. 410 in between. 


4 Cap. 1. of the word of god or the holy scriptures. § 2-5. 5 





World, that is, as God made it and created it, and all kingdoms have ceased, but this book, however much it is challenged, remains. God has preserved it with special power. Others who have remained, such as Virgil and Homer, have been loved by the world. 


3. which and at what time the Bible was interpreted. 


Once, when talking about the interpretation of the Bible, D. M. Luther said that 341 years before Christ's birth and incarnation, the Septuagint interpreters, the seventy doctors and scholars of Jerusalem, at the time of Eleazari the High Priest, at the request of the king of Egypt, Ptolemaic Philadelphi, had brought the five books of Moses and the prophets from the Ebraic language into the Greek, and that the same king had spent great expenses on this interpretation. Then, after the birth, suffering and death of Christ, in 124 years, a Jew named Aquila, after being converted to the Christian faith, interpreted the Old Testament from the Ebraic into the Greek language in the time of Emperor Adrian. Three and fifty years after this Aquila lived Theodotius, who also interpreted the Bible. Symmachus did the same in the thirtieth year after Theodotius, under the emperor Severo. One, whose name is unknown, in the eighth year after Symmachus ‘also interpreted the Bible, which interpretation is called Vulgate, that is 1) the common and fifth. 

St. Jerome, who first corrected and improved the seventy interpreters and translators, then translated the Bible from Ebrew into Latin, which interpretation we still use in the churches today. And he did enough for one person, nulla enim privata persona tantum efficere potuisset. But he would not have done badly if he had taken a learned man or two to himself for translation: then the Holy Spirit would have seen himself all the more powerful. 


1) So Stangwald. Aurifaber lacks the words: "VulS., that is". 


According to the saying of Christ Matth. 18, 20: "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will | be in the midst of them. And interpreters or translatores shall not be alone, for good and propria verba do not always fall to one man. And because the Church of the Gentiles has stood, the Bible has never been so _ ready and understandable, so safe, that it could have been read without offense, as we have prepared it here in Wittenberg and brought it into the German language (praise God!). 


4, difference of the Bible and other books. 


Luther said that the Holy Scriptures are full of divine gifts and virtues, and that all the pagans' books teach nothing at all about faith, hope and love; they know nothing at all about it, but the pagans’ books only look at the present, which can be felt and grasped and understood with reason. But trusting in God and hoping in the Lord is not in them. We should see this only from the Psalter and the Book of Job, as these two books deal with faith, hope, patience and prayer. In sum, the Holy Scriptures are the highest and best book of God, full of consolation in all temptation. For it teaches of faith, hope, and love much else than reason can see, feel, understand, and experience: and when things are bad, it teaches how these virtues should shine forth; and teaches that another and eternal life is over this poor miserable life. 


5. what to look for primarily in the Bible, and how to study and learn the Scriptures. 


(Cordatus No. 575. 576. 577.) 


The highest lesson in theology is to be able to recognize Christ. The teacher should not be ashamed to learn from the pupil and the pupil from the teacher, and if | can be indulgent and kind to my friend, how much more Christ to me! 

If the devil leads me to the law, | am condemned, but if Christ leads me back from the law to the gospel and

But because these people, who are still alive in our time and teach God's word diligently, are still present; and who are also still alive, who have seen and heard me, item, Philippum Melanchthonem, D. Pomeranum, and other pious, faithful and righteous teachers: there it might still stand well. But when they are gone, and this time is past, a fall will occur. As we have an example of this in the book of Joshua and Judges. For in the book of Judges Cap. 2, 8-12, it is said: "When Joshua was dead, and all that lived at that time, there arose after them another generation, which knew not the Lord, nor the works which he had done for Israel; and they did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim, and forsook the Lord their fathers' God, which had brought them out of Egypt, and went after other gods. So also, after the apostles’ time, a fall soon arose, because they and their disciples departed: yes, while the apostles were still alive, as St. Paul complains, a great fall happened in the church among the Galatians, Corinthians and in Asia. As, unfortunately, we have also experienced with Muenzer, the Sacramentarians, the Anabaptists, the Antinomians and the like. 


8. the school theologian art in the Bible. 


The art of the school theologians with their speculation in the holy scriptures is nothing but vanity and human thoughts according to reason. | have read much of this in St. Bonaventure, but he has made me almost deaf. | would have liked to know and understand how God was united with my soul, but | could not learn it from it. They say much about the union of the understanding and the will; but it is vain fantasy and rapture. But this is the right speculativa, rather practica theologia, as: Believe in Christ and do what you are obliged to do in your profession. Likewise, the mystical theology of Dionysius is nothing but a work of fables and lies. Just as Plato also fables: Omnia sunt non ens, et omnia sunt ens Everything is nothing, and everything is nothing: 1) and so lets it hang. 


l)' ichts d. i. something. 


True, righteous theology is based on practice, custom, and training, and its foundation and bedrock is Christ, that his suffering, death, and resurrection may be grasped with faith. But all those who today do not hold with us, and do not have our doctrine before them, make for them only a speculative theology, since they are guided by reason and how they speculate about things; for they cannot come from the thought that he who does good and is pious is well off. But it is not so called; but he that feareth and trusteth in God, the same is well in the end. Therefore such speculative theology belongs in hell to the devil, as Zwingel and the sacramentalists also speculate, and think: The body of Christ is in bread, but only spiritually, for we see only bread. So they only dream and follow their thoughts, as much as they can comprehend with their five senses. And this is also Origen's Theologia. But David does not do so, but recognizes his sin and says: Miserere mei, Domine: God, have mercy on me. But among men God cannot maintain that he alone is God, for all men are after deity and would also like to be gods; much less can he maintain that he alone is pious and just; and this he can hardly maintain, that he is immortal. 


9, that the Bible or the Holy Scriptures cannot be studied in depth. 

(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Aug. 5, 1538. 

S. 109.) 

Luther: We will probably remain students of the holy scriptures. Dear one, who can properly grasp this saying (1 Petr. 4:13): "Rejoice that you suffer with Christ"? That we should be joyful in the midst of the greatest distress, even gladly, like children, kissing the rue. But always let the Epicureans go, the presumptuous smarties, who ridicule the Holy Scriptures and think they have learned them all ready; like Jakob Schenk (and Joh. Agricola), who are the pestilence of religion, and the fruit of their hopefulness and contempt will be nonsense and blindness. Ah! dear God, we want to act so thirsty in your sanctuary, and

Therefore, the world cannot understand them, since it neither knows nor understands anything about the mortification and death of the old Adam, which is clearly and distinctly indicated in the Word of God. And just as one does not understand God's word, so one cannot be wise in God's matters. This can be seen in Adam, who had only two sons. The firstborn was called Cain, that is, a householder. This one, as Adam and Eve thought, was supposed to be the man of God, and the heir of the serpent was supposed to crush the serpent's head. After that, when Eve became pregnant again, they hoped that there would be a daughter, that the

Wisdom has no limit, but what is ours, as reason, insight and everything else, is it not circumscribed by a certain limit? 

The saints understand the word of God and can speak of it, but they do not learn it. The scholastics have used the parable of a ball; when it lies on a table, it is indeed grasped completely with the eyes, but the table touches it only at one point.

When we have learned these words, or rather only this one "Father", then the faith in our heart falters and our weakness thinks: Yes, who knows if it is true? But | know one word, which is the most difficult in the whole scripture, namely "Thine" in the _ first commandment. (Ex. 20, 2.)

After that, | [Cordatus] tried to bring him back to the previous thoughts, and asked what one should answer those who urge plerophoria [complete certainty in doctrine] like Campanus? He answered, Against plerophoria no one ever taught in Wittenberg, but they talk about the question whether there is anyone who has this plerophoria. And he said, we must be sure of our doctrine or faith, and so on. 

4) At another time, Luther said about the understanding of the Holy Scriptures that no one should remember that he had tasted the Scriptures, because he had ruled the church for a hundred years with the prophets, John the Baptist and the apostles. Therefore, it is a great miracle to understand God's word correctly. 


(10) That the Scriptures are difficult to understand. 


M. Luther wrote these words in Latin on a piece of paper in 1546, when he was in Eisleben and lived only two days later, and left them on his table. I, Johannes Aurifaber, copied it, and Mr. Justus Jonas, Superintendent of Halle, who was in Eisleben at that time, kept the note with him.

After that Luther said: "We will, God willing, be diligent to leave a righteous church and school for our (The first paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 4, § 3 and/descendants after us, SO that they may Know how to

held before the Lord, and before God the blood of the pious is held in honor. When this is shed, Abel's blood cries out in heaven, and God must hear this. But that such great wickedness and_ ingratitude and godlessness arise in the world now that the gospel has risen again and the Antichrist has been struck to the ground; this is because before the light of the gospel was brought to light again, people did not see or recognize sin in this way. But now, because the bright morning star has risen, the whole world awakens, as if from a stupor, and sees to some extent the sin that it could not see before in sleep and in the dark night. 

| hope that the last day will not be long, not more than a hundred years, because God's word will fall again and great darkness will come through the lack of servants of the word. Then the whole world will become animalistic, and will walk in such a crude life in the most certain way. Then the voice will sound (Matth. 25, 6.): "Behold, the bridegroom comes." For God will no longer be able to suffer it. 


13. of the future loss of the divine word. 


In 1536, on the 2nd day of December, Luther spoke of the future hunger of the Word of God, and of great tribulation and sorrow that would follow, such as had not been from the beginning of the world, according to the saying of Christ Matth. 24, 21.And how now such affliction is already present, namely, the oppression and corruption by tyrants and fanatics, since the spiritualists especially torture, frighten and mislead the consciences in such a way that they do not know which way is right or which doctrine is right. And said D. Luther: "No greater harm can befall us than when God's Word is taken from us and falsified, so that it is not pure. God protect us so that we and ours do not experience this harm: he would rather let us die first, or kill the Turk, or otherwise die blessedly with grace. 


Cap. 1. of god's word or the holy scriptures. 


12-15. 17 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, on Jan. 10, 1538, p. 8.) 

Where people have the truth, they are always safe. But in error they are very careful and try very hard, just as a wanderer walks safely on the right path, but is very anxious on the wrong path. That is how it is with us now. 


14) The future lack of righteous preachers of the divine word. 


D. Luther said: "In a short time there would be such a lack of pastors and preachers that the present righteous preachers would be scratched out of the earth again, if they could be had; then the papists, and also our peasants, who plague the preachers so much, will see what they have done. For physicians and lawyers remain enough to rule the world; but one must have two hundred pastors in a country, since one has enough of one lawyer. If there were only one lawyer in Erfurt, that would be enough. But it is not the same with the preachers. Every village and small town must have its own pastor. My most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, has enough lawyers for his country and people, but he must have 1800 pastors. In the meantime, we still have to make parish priests out of lawyers and Medicis. You will see. 


15. where God's word is taught, people are the most wicked. 


In all lines, from the beginning of the world, where God's word is taught and preached purely, people are most wicked and commit the greatest and most heinous sins, as in the time of Noah, Abraham, and the Lord Christ and the apostles; for then the world lived most ungodly and in the highest ingratitude and wickedness. So also now, in our time, the people are very presumptuous ingrates, and much more stingy than they ever were before: they do not like to help a poor person with a penny. But it shall be so. However, whom one will deceive, 1) that one shall well know. 


1) So Stangwald, instead of: "if they will be deceived".

And said upon it, Let every man send himself into the time, and use it, and cut in, because there is yet harvest; and as the Lord Christ Joh. 12, 35. saith, "Walk in the light, because ye have it, that darkness overtake you not." 


17. of the excess and contempt of the word of God. 

(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, April 14, 1538, p. 62.) 

That day he admonished his wife to read and hear the word diligently, especially the Psalter. But she boasted that she had read and heard enough and knew it, God willing, she lived by it. Luther answered with a sigh: "Thus arises the weariness and contempt of the Word, that we allow ourselves to think much, want to know it, and yet do the contradiction, and want to be unpunished for it. This leads to misfortune, and God makes us hungry for His word. There will be many new interpretations and the Scriptures will be neglected. That is why | would prefer that my books not be printed, because of the future mobs that will cause all kinds of misfortune. For in my first books | gave the pope a lot of slack, and then | also interpreted the passages of Scripture a little too leniently, as | had read them at the time. At another time, Doctor Luther spoke of the excess of the divine word and said: "The world has become very secure, and relies on the books it now has, and thinks that if people read them, they can do anything. And he said, "The devil would have made me more lazy and secure, thinking, 'Here are the books, if you read them, you can do it. So the Anabaptists and Sacramentarians also make them believe that if they only read a little book, they can do everything. Against such certainty | pray forever, and repeat my Catechismum after Lin 


other, like my little Hans. And pray daily that God will keep me by His holy, pure Word, that | will not grow weary of it or think that | have studied it out. 

Otherwise, he once said that the nobility, burghers and peasants, and almost everyone, high and low, knew the gospel much better than he, Luther, or St. Paul himself, as they thought. For they were wise, and thought that they were more learned than all the pastors: but they despised not the pastors, but the Lord and chief of all pastors, who commanded them to preach; who again will despise them, and be their enemy, and take hold of their heads, that they may feel it; he that saith Luc. 10:16, "He that heareth you heareth me," and "he that assaileth you taketh hold of the apple of my eye." Zech. 2, 8. 


(Seven lines omitted here because contained in Cap, 65, § 8.) 


18. ingratitude of the world for God's word. ( Cordatus No. 1400.) 


Since [God] gives His Son for the servant, and the servant is ungrateful, even wanting to kill the Father and the Son who redeemed him, is this not an ingratitude worthy of all the Turks, pestilence, etc.? 


19. what God's word drives out. 


At the table, where the doctor had several scholars as guests, the gospel was discussed, as it had come to Sweden, Denmark, and now to other foreign countries: for even in Hungary, where the Turk reigns, the gospel is preached, and from the same place those who would be called to the church office were sent to Wittenberg, and had them ordained there; as the reformation of the churches in Carinthia shows. Then said D. Luther said: "Praise be to God, who wants to rule even in the midst of his enemies. He will reign even in the midst of his enemies and be known under the cross. For tyranny and persecution will not drive out nor eradicate the Gospel, 1) but our shameful, cursed, harmful ingratitude and disgust for the dear Gospel. 


1) Cf. cap. 37, § 148, near the end. 


20 


20. The enthusiasts despise God's word. (Cordatus No. 1264. 1265.) 


It is astonishing that the oral word is so despised by the sectarians, since even Christ after his resurrection would have appeared to his disciples as a mere ghost if he had not comforted them with his words. It is the devil's only concern that he should take away our swords. But the Scripture says differently [Ps. 45:4], "Gird up thy sword at thy side, thou hero; put it forth, lash out." 

When Schweinsfeld 1) had debated with me for a long time, he finally said: "Doctor, you must put the words "this is my body" out of your eyes, then we will come to an agreement. It is certain that the pope did it this way from the beginning, before he arrogated to himself the sole authority over the interpretation of the word; thus he crucified Christ. Let us only take care of the word, and we will crucify them again. 


The antinomians are despisers of the divine word. (Contained in Cap. 22, § 53.) 


22. that the persecutors of the Christians and the divine word have little luck. 


Emperor Diocletiani's persecution, said Luther in Eisleben, was very great, because he was willing to murder and exterminate all Christians, and had twelve thousand Christians killed at once. And when all the executioners and their servants had grown tired of the slaughter, he had new executioners 2) brought in and had the Christians beheaded, and thus thought to deter the Christians from the divine word with his tyranny. When this did not help, he also raged against the female gender, which he reviled and dishonored. He had two trees bent down against each other and tied an arm and a foot of a woman to each tree. 


1) A derisive name for Caspar von Schwenkfeld in Silesia, as also "Stenkefeld . Walch, old edition, vol. XX, 2195. 2) So Stangwald instead of executioner's knife. 


Cap. 1. of god's word or the holy scriptures. § 20-22. 


21 


The tree was then broken open and the women were torn to pieces. Or he would hang them naked on the trees with one arm or leg and let them hang until they died. If they wanted to cover their shame, they could do it with the arm that was not tied to the tree. 

Finally, when everything was in vain, and the Christian matrons and women did not want to fall away from the divine word and their dear Lord Christ, he had hot lead poured into the backs and fronts of the women (to speak with breeders) and strangled them. When the Roman Empire became empty of people and desolate, so that there were no more farmers, cobblers or tailors (because this emperor killed countless people through his cruel tyranny), the emperor was told that he would not be able to do anything with his tyranny. For he would either have to let the doctrine of the Gospel be preached freely, so that he would retain subjects in the empire; or, if he wanted to kill all the Christians and clear them away, that he would have to endure the danger that he would have the Roman empire quite desolate and empty of people. When Diocletianus, the emperor, found out that his slaughtering and strangling were of no avail, and that God's punishment would also befall him, and that he would not be safe in life and limb, he resigned from the empire and became a hortulanus, planting herbs and grafting trees.

One should read the old teachers, they have sucked the juice of truth out of the Bible, the Bible causes all turmoil. That is the world's judgment, said D. M.

For if we say to the great men, And now, ye kings, let yourselves be instructed, 2c. if they say no to it, and will not suffer the doctrine; then we must also let them go as good fellows. 


28. the swarmers' error of God's word. (Lauterbach, May 10, 1538, p. 77 ff.) 


On May 10, he read a book by Bullinger, who was very vehement against the Anabaptists, who despised the oral word, and otherwise against those who appropriated too much to the word, for they sinned against God and his divine omnipotence, just like the Jews, who called the ark of the Lord God in 1 Sam. 6; Bullinger, however, as if he were trying to keep the right center, taught the true reason, which was the right use of the word and the sacraments. To this Luther answered and said: "He is wrong, does not know himself what he means. | see their deception well, they do not want to appear to have erred, and [claim that] we and they have stood on two extreme things [extremes]. They reject the oral word and the power and effect of the sacraments altogether; but we press hard upon them. Now they seek the middle way, and praise the Word and the sacraments, so that we too may drop our extreme opinions and be one with them. Previously they taught that the oral word and the sacraments were only signs and slogans of love. Thus Zwinglius and Oecolampadius went too far. When Brentius resisted, they softened their opinions as if they had not rejected the oral word and other means, but only condemned some gross abuses. They thus separated the word and the spirit from one another; they separated the 


Man who preached the word, from God, who worked; the servant who baptized, from God, who cleansed [through baptism]; and think that the Spirit is given and works without the word. Let this word be but an outward watchword, which findeth the spirit that is before in the heart. Now if the word does not find the spirit, but an ungodly man, then it is not God's word. And so they lie, and define the word not according to God who speaks it, but according to the man who receives it, and yet they want this to be the word of God, which produces fruit, which brings peace and life, but because it is not effective in the ungodly, it is not the word of God. Thus they teach that "the outward word is, as it were, an object, an image that explains something, and they determine only its material use, not wanting it to be an instrument and effective cause, a bearer of the Holy Spirit and the beginning of justification. They are drowned in this error and do not understand themselves. Oh, dear Lord God, if only someone would be angry to death against the devil, who so resists the word and rages in the papists and enthusiasts. He sees well that the oral word and the outward office of the church are doing him harm. That is why he is now spreading various errors against it; but | hope God will strike against it recently. 

But a Christian must certainly say: The word of God is one and the same word, whether it is preached to the pious or to the ungodly, just as the church is among sinners; and the same word, whether it bears fruit or not, is a power of God, which makes blessed all who believe in it [Rom. 1, 16.], and which will judge the ungodly, Joh. 12, [44. ff.]. Otherwise, the wicked would have a very good excuse before God, that they could not be condemned, because they would not have had a word, since they would not have accepted it. But we say that the preacher's (even though he is a man) word, absolution, sacrament, is not the work of a man, but the voice of God, the cleansing and effect of God, but we are only the instrument and co-workers of God, through whom God acts and works. We

not have meant it; for as such speech is otherwise dangerous in worldly matters, so it is very harmful in theology. Therefore the canonists, the pope's hypocrites and other heretics, are quite a Chimaera, and a horrible beast of wonder, whose face is like a beautiful virgin, and the body is like a lion, but the tail is like a serpent: that is, their doctrine seems beautiful, seems pretty, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful, seems beautiful. Their doctrine is beautiful, seems beautiful, and what they teach is pleasing to reason and has a reputation; then their doctrine breaks through with force, for all false teachers commonly have the brachium saeculare, attached to them, but in the end it is a slippery uncertain doctrine, just as a snake has a smooth skin and wipes through one's hands. 

At another time, D. Luther said: "First of all, we must know whether this doctrine of ours, which we lead, is the word of God; for if we know this, then we can firmly build on it, that this thing shall and must remain, and no devil shall overthrow it, much less the world, with all its courtiers, how much they rage and rage against it. |, praise God, certainly hold my teaching to be the word of our Lord God, and have now chased away from my heart all other beliefs, whatever they may be called. And | have almost overcome these heavy thoughts and temptations, since my heart said for a while: "Are you the only one who knows the right thing? 


in the battle; one must be able to say: | know for certain that what | teach and hold is God's, the high Majesty in heaven's, own word and final decision, and the eternal unchanging truth; the rest, everything that does not agree with it or is contrary to it, is vain lies of the devil, false and wrong. And that alone does it, that one starts a game and stays with it and says: You others all err and are wrong, but my teaching alone is right and God's certain truth, | stay with it, even if the whole world says otherwise. For God cannot lie, because | have His word, which | cannot lack, nor be overcome by all the gates of hell; and | have the consolation that God says: | will give you people and listeners who shall accept it: let me only worry, | will stand over you, you only stay firm with my word. 

One must be sure that the doctrine is right and the eternal truth, and not ask anything about how it is held by people. Therefore Christ says John 8:46: "Who among you can reprove my doctrine? but if | tell you the truth, why do you not believe me?" And all the apostles were most certain of the doctrine; and St. Paul especially practiced the Plerophoriam, when he said to Timothy, "I do not believe you.

Moses said that he went and asked the Lord for advice, which is to be understood as meaning that he asked the advice of righteous teachers, who advised him that he should not do anything against God. Moses then explained himself and said, "He no longer went to the judge, as he had before, but to a false teacher and a false prophet. 

This way of speaking, that they asked God for advice, gives us an indication that they held up God's word, and that they did not look at those who spoke it, but looked at what they spoke. Thus Rebekah, Gen. 25, 22, did not ask God Himself, but Shem, or an archfather, for advice. For God has always had certain persons and places in the world by and through which He has made His will known. Thus he sent Moses, and through him revealed his word to the children of Israel, so that when he spoke something, they had to say, "This was not given by Moses, but by God himself. After Moses he sent Christ. His teaching is certain, so is his person, so that we cannot be mistaken nor deceived about what we hear from him, that God himself has certainly spoken it; as the heavenly Father says Matth. 17, 5: "This is my beloved Son, whom you shall hear." And when Christ ascended into heaven, he sent the apostles into the whole world, first instituting baptism and his supper. Now, when God's word is heard and the sacraments are received, we can say with truth: God says so. Thus, many times, when | was in temptation and in fear, Philip Melanchthon, or O. Pommer, or even my housewife, comforted me with God's word, so that | was satisfied, and felt: God says this, because the brother said it, either because of office, or because of the duty of doctrine; for God seriously commands that one should hear Christ, and Christ says that we should hear the apostles. 

And this also deceives the sacramentarians and other enthusiasts who speak of God's things according to their thoughts. But we say that one should hear what God says. 


1) Cf. cap. 7, § 160. 


Now God says before the creation of the world: "Let there be the world! then the world came into being and stood immediately. He also says the same thing in the Lord's Supper, that the bread (which he gave to his disciples) is his body; so it is certainly there, as the words say, and does not hinder Bullinger's cavillation here, since he pretends that, because Christ's body is not seen, it does not exist nor is it present; for here he did not create the visible, but the invisible [things], in the form and manner that he willed and pleased him. That God has preserved his word in the world, and that the kingdom of the Lord Christ has remained in the world in the papacy, is one of the greatest miracles of our Lord God. But our Lord God takes some hearts, to whom he reveals his word, and gives them a mouth for it, and preserves it, not by the sword, but by his divine power. 


The word of God is a fiery shield to all who trust in it. 


The word of God is a fiery shield, because it is more proven and purer than gold tried in the fire; which gold loses nothing in the fire, and nothing comes off it, but it endures, remains and overcomes everything. Therefore, he who believes the word of God overcomes all things and remains eternally secure against all adversity. For this shield fears nothing, neither the gates of hell, nor the devil, sin, or death, but the gates of hell fear him; for the word of God endures forever, sustaining and protecting all who trust in it. Otherwise, without God's word, the devil has won the game, for no one can resist him, nor ward him off, without God's word alone: whoever grasps this, and firmly believes in it, has won. Therefore, we should not forget the divine word, much less despise it, as the devil seeks it. 


God is certainly sought and found in his word of Christ. 


(This § is from the Great Interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, cap. 1. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, [trans.] § 56 and § 55.)

(37) That all our actions and life should be arranged according to the divine word. 


God also has his guidelines and canons, which are called the Ten Commandments, which are written in our flesh and blood; and the sum of them is: that which you would have done to yourself, do also to others. And our Lord God keepeth these things: for by the measure that thou measureest thou shalt be measured again. God has marked the whole world with this guideline and yardstick: those who live and do according to it, good for them, for God will reward them abundantly here in this life, and the same reward can be shared by a Turk and a Gentile as well as a Christian. 


God Himself speaks through the Word, and such a Word is powerful. 


D. Luther once spoke of God Himself speaking to us through His Word, and said: If it is true that God speaks to us in the Holy Scriptures, and you still doubt it, you must 1) think in your heart that he is a liar who speaks a thing and does not keep it. But believe thou that he is the supreme divine majesty; therefore, though he open his mouth, it is as much as three worlds, he poureth out the whole world with one word, Gen. 1; and Ps. 33:9 it is said, "When he speaketh, it is done; when he giveth, it standeth." 

Therefore, first and foremost, a certain distinction should be made between the word of God and the word of man. A man's word is a small sound that passes into the air and soon vanishes: but the word of God is greater than heaven and earth, even death and hell; for it is the power of God and endures forever. If it is God's word, then it should be taken for it and believed that God Himself speaks to us; therefore one would gladly learn His word. David saw this and believed it, for he says in the Psalter: "God speaks in His sanctuary, | am glad of it. Ps. 60, 8. And we should also rejoice in this, but such joy is also often oversalted for us; as then

David also had to endure many temptations, including murder, adultery and expulsion, so that he would walk and remain in the fear of God. That is why he says in the 2nd Psalm verse 11: "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling". Somebody rhyme this together, be glad and be afraid. My son Hans can do it against me, but | cannot do it against God. For when | sit and write, or do something else, he sings a little song to me; and if he wants to make it too loud, then | start him a little, he sings on all the same, but he does it more secretly, and somewhat with worry and timidity. So God also wants us always to be joyful, but with fear and reverence for God. 


God's word is the highest consolation. (Cordatus No. 1832.) 


The highest grace is to have the word of God, for he who does not have it will one day fall into despair. This is what David says [Ps. 119, 21. "Cursed are those who lack your commandments" and [Matth. 15, 13.]: "All plants [which my heavenly Father did not plant, me will be choked out." 


40. the gospel is a mystery 


(This § is in the church postil. Walch, St. Louis ed. vol. XI, 523 § 19; Col. 519 § 9.) 


By the Word of God the world, especially the Church, is 

governed and sustained. 

(Lauterbach, Nov. 4, 1538, p. 157. Follows Cap. 3, 8 77.) 

Speaking is a great and divine gift to men; for by word and not by force wisdom rules men, instructs, edifies, comforts, soothes in all situations of life, especially in matters of conscience; therefore God has given His church an audible word and visible sacraments. But Satan resists this holy ministry of preaching with all seriousness and would like it to be destroyed, because this alone would destroy his kingdom. 

It is truly a great and marvelous power of the oral word, that through such a weak word, which comes out of man's 


38 Cap. 1. of God's Word or the Holy Scriptures § 41. 42. 39 


The devil, who is a very hopeful spirit, is chased away and put to shame by the hissing of the human mouth. That is why he is so vehemently opposed by the sacramentarians, who even despise it, as Carlstadt calls it a hissing of the human mouth. | will be silent of the Anabaptists who blaspheme the oral word. St. Paul says (1 Thess. 2, 13.): "When you receive from us the word of divine preaching, you receive it, not as the word of men, but as the word of God." Item, to Romans, Cap. 10, 14: "How shall they believe, of whom they have heard nothing?" Likewise, in 2 Thessalonians, Cap. 2, 4. he says of Antichrist, who exalts himself above all that is called God or worship, above God who is preached (Aeyouevov). Otherwise, besides this word, every fanatic would make up a special worship and God. Rom. 1. (v. 16.): "There is a power of God which makes blessed all who believe in it." And Matth. 10, 20: "It is not you who speak, but it is your Father's Spirit who speaks through you." Nevertheless, the sacramentarians are so bold, and unashamedly reject the oral word, since they conclude: "No external thing makes blessed: the oral word and the sacraments are external things; therefore they do not make blessed. 

| answer: It is much another, God's outward thing, and man's. God's outward thing is wholesome and very powerful. The poor people thought that the external preaching ministry was the same as the cold human traditions of the papists. So the devil went with Schitzen: 1) Flesh is of no use (Joh. 6, 63.). If this argument were valid, an unspeakable harm would have followed, for he would have rejected all external means. The devil has also seen this, for he is wont to start with the lowly until he rises to the heights. 


1) The manuscript has: "So gienng der teuffel mit fchutzenn." The meaning is perhaps: The devil himself, through his members, has perverted God's word with fiery arrows against the truth, in order to destroy and exterminate it. Aurifaber has: "So the devil also dealt with Zwingel, and drove him, since he said 2c." Bindseil I, 44th: "So the devil went with schertzen." Possibly, however, it is to be read: "So the devil went about with shooters." Then the meaning would be: the devil gave such stupid reasons to the ignorant ABC students. Cf. Cordatus No. 1488 in Cap. 60, § 13. 





God instructs man's heart, reason, hands and feet through His Word. 


God alone instructs the heart through His word, so that it first comes to know itself, so that it may know how evil and depraved it is, even that it is an enmity against God; as St. Paul testifies Rom. 8, 7. Then God leads man to come to the true knowledge of God, and to be rid of sins, and after this miserable and short life, to attain eternal life. On the other hand, human reason, with all its wisdom, can go no further than instructing people how to govern themselves and live honorably in this temporal and transitory life: that they may do what is good for them in the sight of the world, and that they may leave off what is bad and evil for them. Item, how one should learn to govern, to keep house, to build, and other good arts, that one learns in philosophy and from the pagan books; and nothing more. But how to know our Lord God and His dear Son, Jesus Christ, and to be saved, this the Holy Spirit teaches only through the divine Word; for philosophy understands nothing in the matters of God. And | am very concerned that it will be mixed too much with theology, although | do not dislike the teaching and learning of philosophy. | praise and approve of it, but it requires modesty; let the philosophy remain in its circle, for which God has given it, and use it like a masked person when one plays comedies, and as one otherwise uses worldly justice. But that one wants to mix her into the theologiam, as if she also belonged to it, that does not do, it is also not to be suffered. And | do not like it at all that faith is called a thing, or a quality, or a skill, or an accidental thing; for these are all philosophical words, used in schools and in other worldly affairs, which reason can understand. It thinks that true faith remains in us like the paint on the wall; but faith is a thing in the heart that has its essence for itself, given by God as its own work. But 


40 Cap. 1. of god's word or the holy scriptures. § 42-46. 41 


not such a substantia and self-existent thing, ut in praedicamentis corpus est substantia, as one otherwise teaches the boys in schools, that a corporeal thing, so one can see, grasp and touch, is a substance and self-existent thing. 


43. God has bound us to the oral word. 


Doctor M. Luther once sighed for the sake of the sects and cults that despised God's word, and said: "Oh, that | were a good poet, | would gladly write and make a delicious carmen, song or poem about the benefit, power and fruit of the divine word; for without God's word everything is nothing and in vain, especially what one does in matters of faith. Therefore, God has bound us to His oral word when He says Luc. 10, 16: "He who hears you hears Me." There he speaks of the oral word that comes out of a man's mouth and sounds in other people's ears, and does not speak of the spiritual word that comes from heaven, but that sounds through the mouths of men. The devil has challenged this from the beginning of the world, and has opposed it, and would gladly eradicate it; therefore let us stay with this medium and means, and hold the word in honor. For some years now | have read the Bible twice a year, and if it were a mighty tree, and all the words were branches and twigs, | have knocked on all the branches and twigs and wanted to know what was in them and what they were capable of, and always knocked down a few more apples or pears. 1) 


44. how to teach God's word correctly. 


The Word of God must be taught and shared correctly, for there are two kinds of people: 2) Some are frightened and grieved in conscience, as they feel their sin and God's wrath, and have remorse and sorrow over it; these are to be comforted with the Gospel. Then there are hard, wicked, hardened, stiff- necked hearts, which must be comforted with the preaching of the law. 


1) Cf. § 1 of this Cap. 2) Cf. Cap. 9, § 16; 12, § 19. § 43. § 62; 22, § 60; 26, § 16. 


and punish them, and hold up to them the examples of divine wrath. As, Elijah's fire; item, the flood, Sodom's and Gomorrah's downfall, and the destruction of the glorious city of God, Jerusalem, for these same stubborn heads must be attacked and terrified. 


45. the listeners of divine word find guilty to feed the preachers. 

(The first paragraph to "Commandment" at Cordatus No. 309.) 

The hearers of the divine word are more obliged to feed the ministers of the word, than that they should not fornicate, steal 2c.: for the ministry of preaching concerns not only the first table of the ten commandments of God, but especially the first commandment. St. Paul also tells the Corinthians that "whoever serves the altar should also live from the altar, and the ox that feeds should not have its mouth tied", 1 Cor. 9, 9. 

But how does the world maintain the preaching ministry? Luther spoke of this in Eisleben shortly before his death and said: "The poor preachers are now treated strangely. For if they now have a patch of wood, beautiful meadow wax, arable land or vineyards in their parishes, it is taken from them. One shares with them, just as he in the fables of Aesopi made a pact with Mercurio 3) that he would give half of everything he found to Mercurio. When he found a sack of dates and almonds, he went and peeled the almonds, and put the almond shells on one side, together with the date kernels, and put the almond and date kernels on one side. He gave half of the almond shells and date kernels to Mercurio, but kept the almond kernels and date kernels for himself. So the portion that the peasants give to the poor preachers and priests is nothing else, but dead shells, chaff, grubs and such small things. 


The Word of God points to all divine states and teaches how to conduct oneself in them. (Lauterbach, May 29, 1638, p. 89.) The Holy Scripture tells us in the shortest and most explicit way how to live rightly. In

with the powder, so that it does not burn, the teaching is right. Then Matthias of Vai quickly jumped on one of the barrels and sat on it, but the pope did not want to get on the other barrel with his help. Then the monk George said: Now | see that the faith and doctrine of Vai is right, and your, the papists', religion is wrong: he punished the same papist priest and his assistant for four running Hungarian guilders, and had to pay and maintain two hundred soldiers for him for a while; but he let Matthiam de Vai preach the gospel publicly. 

And Luther said: "No one on the papist side wants to dare to go into the fire, but our people go confidently into the fire, yes, into death; as one experienced in the past with the holy martyrs, St. Agnes, St. Agatha, Vincentio and Laurentio. Should the papists now be driven to the fire for the sake of their doctrine and religion, oh how many would fall away. Illi sunt Martyres active, non passive. Emperors, kings, princes and lords now drive out and murder the Christians, so the Turk accepts them, defends, protects and handles them. Papistae nolunt regnum Christi, habeant ergo regnum diaboli. This is what Luther said at Eisleben in 1546 shortly before his death, and he also said: We are respected in the world ut oves occisionis. 

Next, in Paris, two nobles and two magistrates were burned for the sake of the Gospel: the theologians got the king of France to light the fire himself with a straw wipe.

Preaching God's word brings the cross. (Cordatus No. 1.) 


When God preaches His word, He adds one thing so that the word may be understood. For example, when he preaches that the cross follows the word, the pious experience the cross soon after hearing the word. In the same way, when faith is preached and good fruits follow faith, it is impossible that the one who has been taught by

If a man is righteous by faith, he should not also do good works in his own time. And if this did not happen, no one would understand God's word rightly, because action interprets the word rightly. This is what Christ wants when he says: "Now | tell you before it comes to pass, that when it is done ye may believe." [John 13:19Z 


58. Whoever wants to teach and confess God's word must not wait for honor, but for the holy cross. 


Whatever gifts our Lord God gives to the people of the world, they take the glory from it; thus people boast of goods, power, wealth, wisdom, art 2c. Our Lord God allows this to happen and suffers it; only God's word and religion (if it is otherwise righteous, pure and unadulterated), since he alone wants to have and keep the glory of it; how just. Therefore he hangs the dear cross, shame, persecution, the world and the devil on the necks of us, who are righteous, faithful teachers, to keep us in humility, so that he alone will keep the honor and we will not become trustworthy. For this reason it rhymes that if one wants to seek honor and good in theology and in God's word, as if he wanted to take coals from a fiery furnace, he would certainly burn himself. Let every theologian, yes, every Christian, be guided by this; otherwise nothing will come of it, if he does not want to be a false teacher and a muzzling Christian.

Just as we become children of God through such a birth, which God accomplishes without our doing, so we also become heirs in the same way: but now that we have become heirs, we are free, set free from sin, death and the devil, and have eternal life and righteousness.

In the past, there was evil study, especially in the Holy Scriptures. 


In our time, studying was evil, since theology and all the good arts were despised, and fine, clever minds were plagued with sophistry. Aristotelem, the pagan, was held in such esteem that whoever denied him or contradicted him was considered the greatest heretic in Cologne and condemned; since they did not understand Aristotelem, the sophists obscured him much more. As the monk did, who spent two hours in the passion sermon with this question: Utrum Quantitas realiter distincta sit a Substantia? Whether the quantity in itself is distinct from the essence? And showing this example, he said, "My head could creep through this hole, but the size of the head cannot. So he separated the head from its size, as a fool. A bad grammarian could have solved it in a simple way and said: the size of the head, that is, the largest head. 

With such foolish work, fine, skilful minds were burdened, and neither in good arts nor in theology were they properly instructed and taught. Thus Antipho, Cusa, Cardus, Bovillus and others have labored miserably and tried how they could bring that which is round into the square, also comparing the right string or equal lines with the crooked. Now we have blessed times, God wanted the youth to make good use of them, and to study diligently in those arts that are now flourishing and green. 


The word of God is not to be judged by the fruits and lives of the hearers.

When M. Luther read the Psalter at one time, he was very surprised that David had such a spirit, and said: Dear God, what high people these were!

80. By God's word one should remain alone and hold fast. (The beginning of this § is transferred to Cap. 3, § 23, where it belongs. The following is in Kummer p. 378 [Lauterbach p. 87] and follows after Cap. 3, § 23.) Such visible and physical things we see daily and cannot understand them and are forced to say: "I believe in God the Father" 2c. Nor do we fools want to master God in the article of reincarnation and salvation, and much disputing about infant baptism and the secret powers of the sacraments, so we poor fools do not know where the great Junker Fart in the belly comes from. So it is said that when GOD speaks A Word, the whole world should tremble, believe and obey. Away with the exceedingly godless Papists, who dare to prefer the fabricated prestige of their church to the Word of GOD. For this Papist argument is the highest and most intolerable blasphemy, so that they spit God in the face. Great indeed is the patience of God who endures this. But it has always been so. For the God of Bethel was held in high esteem by the people of God, but the God that Jeremiah preached was of no value at all. It costs our Lord God so much to keep his power and mercy with a few. He must smite many kings before a few people learn to fear him, and he must make many harlots and knaves blessed before a few sinners learn to believe him. Therefore the prophets and apostles do not labor in vain, that we may abide in the word of God. For without this word we are lost. If we do not wrap ourselves in this God who has become flesh and has been put into words, then we will soon be devoured by the devil. 


The word of God is to be heard, not pondered according to God's majesty. (Contained in Cap. 2, 8 9, paras. 2-4.) 


82. a different. (Lauterbach, Sept. 12, 1538, p. 131.) 


A Hungarian presented Luther with strange, ludicrous and unnecessary questions, which he had written down. Luther said: Ah! that 


We remain with the revealed will of God, because God has revealed everything to us in Christ, whom we should listen to: He knows how to solve all these "arguments". Yes, God wants to give us everything in Christ, only we should humble ourselves in true obedience. But we don't want to, and apart from Him we are fools, and we deal with the question why God does it this way, lets it happen this way, and we also want to be a little bit in the game. 


83. a different. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 16.) 


That God's word was preached much more powerfully in the time of the apostles, and ours now, and was spread farther than in the time of Christ. 

(Contained in Cap. 12, § 26.)-. 


85. contempt of the divine word. (Cordatus No. 256 and No. 257.) 


The things of God are so evil that | can no longer advise them. For nothing of all that he does with us, even in the most merciful way, remains uncorrupted for him. This can be clearly seen in the words of God. As often as he gives it to the world again, it is despised, mocked, persecuted and eradicated from the world, as much as there is in it. If he does not give it, we are condemned. But if he has given it, we condemn it, and we condemn it by deed and by denial. For if we believe, we do not; if we disbelieve, we deny. Since this is how his word is in this world, what, | ask, happens to all his works, even to himself? 

It will happen again, as it did before, that all those who now advise the world for its salvation will run away into the deserts, because of the exceedingly great ingratitude, which always turns the best into the worst. 


86) The essence of a thing is to be separated from its custom, and alone Staying with God's Word. 


(Contained in Cap. 22, § 34 and again in another redaction Cap. 37,871) 


58 Cap. 1. of god's word or the holy scriptures. § 87-89. 59 


The Word of God performs great miracles, but everyone wants to master it. 


The teaching of the Gospel has done great wonders, even in our times: it has cast down and disgraced the monastic vows and the abominable idolatry of the corner masses, which nevertheless have a great reputation and appearance. Oh, if only we would also thank God for this and remember back in what horrible darknesses we had been in the priesthood, from which God has thus graciously redeemed us, without any merit on our part, through His Word, which we so shamefully despise, and thereby provoke God to anger, so that He must punish us. But now everyone wants to be a master of the Scriptures, and everyone thinks that he understands them very well, and has even studied them; just as St. Jerome, in his preface to the Bible, complains that there has not been an old fool and a foolish hag, nor a washed-out sophist, who has not presumed to be a master of theology, and has torn them apart. 

All other arts and crafts have their preceptors and masters, from whom one must learn them, and also order and laws, according to which one must judge and keep; only the holy Scriptures and God's Word must be subject to every one's pride, arrogance, will and presumption, and be mastered, twisted and interpreted as each one understands and wants it according to his own head; hence also come so many cults, sects and aversions; God forbid them. 


Without God's word, the ceremonies are filth and dung. 


Let us pray diligently for God's word, that God's name alone may be hallowed; for if the doctrine is not reformed, all reforming is in vain with life: | throw in all ceremonies without God's word. Although the papists have never said or taught anything about righteous ceremonies. Whoever wants to have a right church, he must adhere to the word by which everything is preserved. 


The word of God is not learned without challenge. 


D. Luther once said: "I did not learn my theology all at once, but | had to search deeper and deeper for it. My temptations have brought me to this, for one can never understand the Holy Scriptures apart from practice and temptations. This is what the fanatics and the mobs lack, that they do not have the right opponent, namely the devil, who teaches them well. So St. Paul also had a devil who beat him with his fists, and thus drove him with his temptations to study diligently in the Holy Scriptures. So | have had the pope, the universities, and all the scholars, and through them the devil on my neck: they have chased me into the Bible, so that | have read it diligently, and thus finally attained their right understanding. If we otherwise do not have such a devil, then we are only speculative theologians who handle their thoughts badly and speculate with their reason alone that it should be this way and that way; as the monks in the monasteries also did. 

After all, you can't learn other good arts or crafts without practice. What kind of a physician or doctor would he be if he stayed and ran in schools all by himself? He must, indeed, bring the art into use and begin to practice it, and the more he acts with nature, the more he sees and experiences that he does not yet have the art rightly and perfectly. So must a lawyer and every craftsman and artist do: what should not such be in the holy Scriptures, since our Lord God has a mighty adversary? 

Itis also a great grace of God that one has a certain text of the Bible before him, from which he can say: This is right, | know that for sure. People think they know everything soon after they have heard a sermon. Zwinglius also thought that he knew it well, but that it was a bad art. But | know that | can't yet do the Lord's Prayer properly, as a learned, old doctor | usually am. 


60 Cap?1. Of God's word or holy scripture. § 89-94. 


lam, or should be. No one can be learned without practice and experience. That is why the peasant said: "Armor is good who knows how to use it properly. So the holy scripture is certainly enough in itself, but God grant that | may also catch and make the right use of it; for if Satan disputes with me, as if God were also gracious to me, | must not make this statement against him, that he who loves God with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, 2c. will possess God's kingdom. For the devil will soon reproach me, and come up to me and say, "You do not love God," as my conscience convinces me. But | must take hold of the saying, and use it against the devil, that Jesus Christ died for me, for through Him | have a gracious Father, who has reconciled me to Him, and as St. Paul says in 1 Cor. 1:30, "He was given to me by God for wisdom, for righteousness, for sanctification, and for redemption. 


90. that the ingratitude against God's word will make our churches great. Do harm. 


D. Luther said: Our church will not suffer such great distress and danger from the tyrants and their persecution as from our own, and from our great security, wit and carelessness. For even though the pope will try all sorts of things against us and will subject himself to them, and will give and give much to his patrons, in the opinion and hope that if this sect of ours (which is what he thinks it is) and doctrine were suppressed, he would get back everything that he has lost so far: But this will not happen, whether God wills it or not, the word of God would perish in the German land, and then God would not stay away long with the last day, and thus, as the last, break into this terrible night, and push the bottom out of the barrel. Otherwise, the tyrants, fanatics and heretics will only drive us into the Bible to read it more diligently and to sharpen our prayers more earnestly. 


61 


91) The bet HLtt's for that the teaching of the divine word soon must perish. 


D. Luther said at Eisleben that omnes sapientes mundi thought that the teaching of the Gospel, because it had begun suddenly, would not last long, but would fall again of its own accord. That is why the present bishop of Magdeburg, Hans Albrecht, has the saying: One must command much of the time. He hoped that the papacy in the German land would again start: he is rightly instructed in Rome, therefore he does not ask anything about our doctrine. The children of the world do not say otherwise: When the thick cloud has passed, it will probably smell differently. 


Preaching God's word annoys the world. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 62.) 


93) How to stand against the despisers of the divine word and the sacraments. 


Dear sirs (said D. Martinus to the parish priests and the clergy, and those who were with them), let us wait on the church with preaching, pure doctrine and sacraments. Whoever will not go to the sacrament, 1) nor learn the catechism, you shall not go to him in his sickness, when he is to die; but let him lie down like a sow: neither take care of him, nor let him be buried in the churchyard, to the horror and disgust of others. 


94. How God spoke to the fathers. 


D. Martinus was asked: How God would have spoken with the fathers, when John says, Joh. 1, 18.: "No one has ever seen God"; and contrary to this the patriarch Jacob would say, Gen. 32, 30.: "I have seen the Lord face to face"? To this the Doctor replied: "God spoke to the fathers through visions and appearances, so they saw God's face, and not God Himself; as we have God's face and see Him through Word, Sacrament,

-the churches key, in the parents and authorities order. how one would like to do with the Lutherans, so that These are God's faces and larvae. For "face" in they could be eradicated? But they had said that the Scripture means God's appearance, presence and Lutherans cite the Holy Scriptures and St. Paul so mercy; as David says: "Lord, do not cast me out of your violently against them and attract them in their books presence. And on the other hand, "to see God's behind and writings; this would be in their way, so that they and back" means to see God's wrath. According to the could not suppress the Lutherans. Then the fool said grammatica, this means God's face and back.

So Moses wanted to see God's pope would have the power to elevate saints; St. Paul face, thatis, His glory, so that the people would believe should also be elevated and placed among the saints him; therefore Moses, as a common person in public from among the apostles, so that his dicta would no office, desired to see God's face, that is, His, longer be apostolic.

It will not help yet. 

And Doctor Martin Luther said that in the face of the world's great, weak practices we have no other consolation than that our God is called "not a God who is far away, but a God who is near," Jer. 23:23, and after that a God of mercy. The same sees all these practices: he does not forget them, for he has a great memory. But what does our Lord God say about this?

For the sake of our hardness, God must be hard and God must be far away. 


1. that reason cannot understand nor comprehend God's works. (The first paragraph, Cordatus No. 295.) 


All the works of God are inexpressible, no one can think them out, they can only be believed, they cannot be thought out; which one then understands a little, if one once carefully considers what the straw is good for. 


(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 827.) 


Believing in God the Creator is impossible, because if we believed that he was, we would also know that he is so powerful that he could destroy the world with one word, as easy as it is for the potter to break down the clay. But if we believed that he was the creator, we would not oppose him with our wisdom, power 2c. In short, in his majesty no one can recognize God. That is why he rightly condescended to become man, yes, to sin, to death, to weakness itself, and made himself small enough. But who can believe even this? We believe that the emperor is more powerful than God, that Erasmus is wiser than him, that a monk is more just. 

Otherwise, D. Luther said at another time: "All the works of God are public in the day, and yet incomprehensible and inscrutable. For who can say how God created the smallest thing and the least creature, but how he gave a flea or a louse eyes and legs; or how in man an eye sees; or how it happens that a woman has milk in her breasts, and carries a child in her womb, how and by whom it is cared for.

In the last days we will see it, and all of them will be as beautiful as Adam and Eve were before the fall, yes, ten times more beautiful; as such things are now before God, as if they had all been made ready. In sum, in all creatures, even the smallest, even in their members, God's omnipotence and great miracles appear and are seen publicly. For what man, however mighty, wise and holy, can make a fig tree or another fig out of a fig? Or from a cherry stone another, or, but create a cherry tree? Or even know how God creates, grows and sustains everything? 

And indeed, in all good arts and creatures one finds and sees imprinted the holy divine Trinity; as, God the Father's omnipotence, God the Son's wisdom, and God the Holy Spirit's goodness. But because we cannot rightly comprehend or understand 1) how it is that the eyeball sees; item, how distinct and distinctly audible words are heard and spoken when the tongue is moved and ruled in the mouth, which are, after all, natural things that we see and deal with every day: how then should we be able to comprehend and investigate the secret counsel of the divine majesty with our reason?

or fable. For as little does it rhyme if someone were to say: Man and stone are One Person; just as little does it rhyme with reason that God became man, or that divine and human nature, united in Christ, is One Person. 

But this is what we Christians have to study all our lives. | also think about this diligently, but | do not understand it. St. Paul understood a good part of it, even though he did not grasp it at all; nevertheless, he brings it out, Col. 2, 9, and says: "In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead in the flesh"; item Cap. 2, 3: "In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." This is to say: Whoever does not find God in Christ, 1) will never find Him; he may seek Him wherever he pleases; much less understand what His will and nature are. But in him we recognize everything, the whole Godhead and humanity; that is, we see in him at the same time the highest power or might, and the highest weakness, life and death, righteousness and sin, God's grace and wrath. Ah! what shall we say, that God became man? it is a very high and heavy article above and against all reason; but no one, or ever so few people take it seriously. 


God is incomprehensible and yet is felt. 


God cannot be comprehended, but He can be felt, for He can be seen and noticed everywhere, and He shows Himself to be a benevolent Creator, who does and gives us all the good things that the sun and moon, the heavens and the earth, and all the fruits that grow from the earth, bear witness to. But the fault that we do not recognize God in such His works and innumerable good deeds is not in the Creator that He wanted such things to be hidden from our eyes. No, the fault is not in him, but in us; for human nature is so corrupted and poisoned by original sin that we cannot respect it, nor recognize and understand it. 


1) Cf. cap. 2, § 157. 


The miracles of God are seen in the smallest and least creatures. (Cordatus No. 302.) 


The greatest miracles of God are seen even in the smallest things: as, in a ripe pear, which half a year before it ripened, sat in the extreme tips of the roots, which are yet very far from the branches on which it now hangs. 


God is beside and above, yet in all creatures. 


Since heaven is His chair, Isa. 66, 1., He will reach far, far above the heavens; and since the earth is His footstool or footstool, He must also be in the whole world; as the following words also testify, since God speaks, v. 1. 2.: "What is the place where | shall rest? | look upon the wretched, and them that are of a broken spirit, and fear my word." As if he should say: These are the ones with whom | have my dwelling and rest. But now these are scattered to and fro in all the world: and if he fills all things, as St. Paul says Eph. 4:10, then he must be present everywhere. Therefore, whoever wants to be wise before God, let him learn his word and fear him; for "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom", Sir. 1, 16; but let him fear so that he also "hopes in his goodness", Psalm 147, 11. 

Otherwise, on another occasion, D. M. Luther said in answer to a question: "Is God outside, above, and yet in all creatures, even the least, as in little grasses and leaves on trees? And he said: God is not bound to any place, nor is He excluded from any. He is in all places, even in the least creature, as in a leaf of a tree or in a blade of grass, and yet He is nowhere. Nowhere, understand tangibly and decidedly; but in all places he is, for he creates, works and sustains all things. But how is he in all creatures? Substantially, or by his almighty power? He is in both ways in every creature: for, as | said, he creates, he works, and he sustains everything. Other creatures work according to their quality, but God is present and essential.

8. another question. (Cordatus No. 818-822.) 


If it is asked why all men are not saved in Christ, since through Adam all are condemned, | answer by this proof [per instantiam]: Let not God be angry, as that basic be-. 

He loves all people in the highest way, for whom he gave his son to death, of whom he said: "You shall hear him". That our Lord God has turned more to love than to hate, we see in the death of His Son. The devil deceived Adam and Eve, but God sent His Son into the world. With these words one must answer those 


exceptions. 

Even if God acts strangely, we should still believe that he is a pious man, because according to his goodness he gives people much more goods than people can "think about". And what he does, he does not do without a cause, and if he had to answer everyone's questions, he would be the poorest God. 

We should look at God's word and avoid the why in it. We should know His word, not investigate His will, which is often hidden, that is, weigh wind and fire on a scale. With this work the investigators of his majesty toil. 


9. another question. 3) 


One of them asked: Why does God do so much that one can neither find the cause, nor indicate it, nor understand it? Ah! says D. Martinus, if we do not know or understand everything that God does, there is no

_§9-11. 11 





God has meant for us, even if there have been misfortunes, fears and hardships. However, we should certainly take care of him that he will not let us perish, neither in body nor soul, but act with us in such a way that everything, whether good or bad, must serve us for the best. 

We fools cannot give a thorough account of how speech is formed in our mouths, how it happens that the voice of one man is clearly heard by so many thousands, and how we can see with our eyes so far and from afar all kinds of colors, and how we can clearly grasp and distinguish what we see before us, except for nothing: item, how bread, food and drink, which we enjoy every day, is transformed in our bodies, so in a short time, into flesh and blood, urine and dung. If we (I say) cannot show thorough cause in these little things, which happen daily with and in us: how are we then so presumptuous and senseless to flutter about the clouds apart from ourselves, to speculate about divine majesty, being and will, which is far too high, incomprehensible and inscrutable for our blind mad reason? 

St. Hilarius adds a fine word: "We are content," he says, "that we do not know how it is with our body, and yet we want to express the divinity. But this we do not do, for there are vain men of the soul who fall and break their necks. Therefore, | faithfully advise that we listen to what God tells us through His Word and act according to it, otherwise all effort and work will be in vain and we will be lost. 


10. another question. 


One asked: Where was God before the heavens were created? St. Augustine answered: He was in himself. When he inquired further, D. Martinus said: He has built hell for the idle and foolish spirits. Now that he has created all creatures, he continued, he is everywhere and yet nowhere: for | cannot grasp him nor take hold of him without the Word, through my thoughts; but there he can certainly be found, where he has bound himself. The 


Jews found him in Jerusalem at the mercy seat, Ex. 25, 17, we in word and faith, in baptism and sacrament; but in majesty he is nowhere to be found. And it was a great grace in the Old Testament that God bound Himself to a certain place where He could be found, namely in the place where the mercy seat was, against which they prayed; first at Shiloh and Shechem, then at Gideon, and finally at Jerusalem in the temple. 

In time, the Greeks and other pagans imitated this and built temples to their idols in certain places, as at Ephesus to Diana, at Delphi to Apollo 2c. For where our Lord God builds a church, the devil builds a chapel after it. They also took this from the Jews, that as the Holy of Holies was dark and had no light, so they also made dark and gloomy the places where the devil answered, as at Delphi and elsewhere. Thus the devil is always our Lord God's monkey. The fact that the Holy of Holies had to be dark means that Christ's kingdom can only be found and understood through the Word and faith, and by no other means. 


11. God is faithful and true. 1) 


That God is faithful and true, he has shown not only in that he has made his promise to us in Christ, through whom we have forgiveness of sins and redemption from eternal death; but he has also presented to us in Scripture many examples of grace and consolation in great saints who were highly enlightened and graced by God, and yet fell into great grave sin. Adam, by his fall and disobedience, bequeathed both sin and death to all his descendants. Aaron brought a great sin upon Israel, that God would destroy them, Deut. 9, 14. David also fell heavily, 2 Sam. 11; Job, Cap. 3, 1., and Jeremiah, Cap. 20, 14, cursed the day in which they were born. Jonah was angry

So when Judah was led captive to Babylon, God chose the prophets, Ezekiel, Haggai, Zechariah, to comfort them in their misery and imprisonment. They also promised them not only the return to the land of Judah, as happened in the first year of Cory king of Persia, 2c. but also that Christ would surely come in his time. 

From this it can be seen that God has never abandoned His people, not even the wretched world (which knows no thanks to Him), even though He lets them be severely punished and tormented for a long time because of their sin. Just as He graciously visited us at this last time and delivered us from the long, heavy, horrible prison of the sorry papacy. May God grant us grace to recognize this and thank Him for it, otherwise things will get worse. 


(13) Abundance of temporal goods hinders faith. (Cordatus No. 661.) 


Our Lord God could become rich, if he could only send himself into it. For He would become rich if He only denied us His creatures, soon the sun, soon the air, soon the water, then we would all give out money. But, since we believe that these gifts are commonplace, people consider them to be nothing and want to think that God is right. In spite of him, that he would not give us the sun every day. Thus the greatness of God's benefits is obscured. 


14. God earns only vain ingratitude with his benefits. 


God gives sun and moon, stars and elements, fire and water, air and earth, and all creatures, body and soul, and all kinds of food of fruits, grains, corns, wine 


miserably mocked, ridiculed and hanged on the gallows, and his servants will be tormented, chased, persecuted and killed. This is the thanksgiving that he has created, redeemed, sanctified, nourished and preserved us by grace. The world is such a herb, fruit and pious child. O woe unto her! 


15. that the wood is a great gift from God. " (Cordatus No. 859.) 


| am surprised where our Lord takes so much wood, firewood, timber, carpenter's wood, wooden shoe wood, cooper's wood, and although the wood has a lot of use in the world, nobody pays attention to it. 


16. that God has almost lost all his titles and names. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 245.) 


God has already lost all his titles, for it seems as if he has become powerless against the mighty wicked of this world and helpless against the wise. And as often as the Christians get into an evil situation, there is immediately the challenge that torments us, that we believe that God has forgotten his mercy, as if he had become a companion of the wicked, who is nevertheless good by nature. For he seems to be well-disposed and benevolent toward the wicked. Thus we believe that he is wicked. But all this is because everything that is God's in this life is very hidden, as it is written [1 Cor. 1:18 ff.] Matt. 6:4, 6, 18. For His power is regarded as weakness, His wisdom as foolishness, and His goodness as wickedness. 

At another time, Luther spoke of how God was held and regarded by the world, saying: "God alone is a sinner, and no one else; all men are sinners. 


1) Cf. § 134 of this Cap. 


ZZ 


The people, on the other hand, are just and everything. But the Father is powerless and impotent; for men are mighty and powerful, as the tyrants whom God cannot resist. The Son alone is a fool, for men are wise and prudent, as heretics, whom the Son cannot answer. But the Holy Spirit is ungodly, for men are God-fearing: just as the false brethren are, and the Holy Spirit cannot do them enough for their sin. So God's power becomes strong in weakness, which becomes weak in our strength and power. Therefore, let us gladly be weak in ourselves, so that we may become strong in God. 


That God might become rich. (Cordatus No. 617.) 


Our God does not want to be rich; he could have it better if he wanted to. Namely, if he came to Ferdinand, to Duke George, to the pope, he would first say: You shall give me ten thousand florins, or you will die in this hour 2c. All would say: Yes, dear Lord, gladly, if only | can live. Now, because he does not act in this way, they are also not grateful to him for his good deeds. If he gave us his gifts more sparingly, we would be more grateful than if he deprived people of their limbs, one of a foot, another of a hand, 2c., and gave them back to one after some years, but not to another. Then they would undoubtedly give thanks to God, and those would ask Him to whom He did not want to give them back. But God is nonsensical, that he pours out everything at once, as he does now, since he lets his word flood over us like a whole sea, gives the liberal arts, the languages; the best books are bought at the lowest price. But woe to our sloth! For God will close His hand again and make us worship the preachers of lies again, since we are now neglecting His true servants.

Cap. 3. of god's works. § 16-20.

19. as God does with us, it is not good. 1) 


How should God do it with us? We can't bear good days, we can't stand bad ones. If he gives us riches, we are proud and hopeful that no one can get along with us, and we only want to be carried on our hands and worshipped as gods. But if he gives us poverty, we despair, become impatient and grumble against him. Therefore nothing is better than to be soon led to the dance with the shovels. Therefore he was right who said: You do not want to suffer misfortune in and from the world, and you do not want to separate from it. How then shall God deal with you? What shall He do who gave His only Son for you? Why are you afraid to go out of the world to him who loved you and died for you? Do you think that the devil or the world will do for you and for your sake what God has done for you? Oh no, not by a long shot. 


20. knowledge of nature. (Dresden manuscript, sheet t 6d. Lauterbach p. 200.) 


Adam did not need a book, because he had the book of nature: and all the archfathers, Christ and the apostles quote much from this book, as of the pain of women in childbirth, Joh. 16, 21. and of the community of the members of the human body (1 Cor. 12, 12.). This similitude in Paul seems to me to be very sweet: They are different members, but of one body, so that no member can do without the other. One serves the other; if the eyes do not see, how should the feet be pounded? if the hands do not grasp, how should one eat? if the feet do not walk, where should the hands take? But the stomach, the lazy belly, lies only in the body and lets itself be fattened, like a sow: if now the hands did not want to give him, then they would

But this is more beautiful because the forgiveness of sins is also depicted in it. One foot often kicks another, a tooth bites a tongue, one often pokes an eye with a finger: there must be forgiveness of sins, or one does not remain one. 


How God deals with the right saints. 


God is wondrous in His saints, and acts miraculously with them, against all human wisdom and reason, so that the godly and Christians may learn to cling to invisible things and come to life again through mortification. For the Word of God is a light that shines in a dark place, as all examples of faith show. Esau was cursed, and yet he was happy and well; he was lord of the land, and priest of the church: but Jacob was a fugitive, and dwelt in misery in another land.

What God wants from us humans. (Cordatus No. 1496.) 


God is a good Lord, who would suffer people to think of Him as their God alone, as He demands in the first commandment, desiring no prize, no money, only that He may be our God, and because of this One He gives everything and gives to all. 


God is not angry. (Abridged from Cap. 2, § 86, therefore omitted.)

25. God's goodness, if you could trust Him. (Cordatus No. 1562.) 


To the little birds that nested in his garden and always fled when we passed by, he said, "Oh, little bird, don't flinch; | wish you well with all my heart, if you will believe me. For so shall we believe God, that he wills us well with all our hearts; for he will not slay us, who gave his Son for me. 


26. God's mercy. 


God's goodness and mercy are not to be searched out, nor is it to be justified, that He does not impute to us such great, horrible sin, that we have crucified His only begotten Son, whom He sent, but covers it up and destroys it. 


(Here 9 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 2, § 56, last paragraph.) 


God is patient. (Contained in Cap. 2, § 95.) 


28. God holds us far too well. 


If our Lord God can grant me that | have crucified and martyred Him for twenty years by taking masses, then He can also grant me that | occasionally have a good drink in His honor: God grant, let the world interpret it as it will. 


29. two regiments from earth. (Cordatus No. 292 and 293.) 


They are three kinds of effects: of the devil, of nature and of God. 

God alone is the one who is ridiculed by all and ridicules all. We have an example of this [Gen. 19, 14], when God wanted to save Lot through the angel. And in the Proverbs of Solomon 1, [26.]: "You laugh at me, so | will also laugh at you in your accident."

86Cap . 2. of god's works. § 30-37. 30. God made everything for the sake of man. 

God's power is great, who feeds the whole world, and it is a hard article for us to say and confess: "I believe in God the Father. He has created everything enough for us, all the seas are our cellars, all the forests are our hunting grounds, the earth is full of silver and gold and innumerable fruits, all created for our sake, and the earth is our granary and larder. 


God's creatures need (or rather abuse) the wicked most of all. 


Our Lord God's goods are enjoyed most by the wicked. For the tyrants have the greatest power - land and people in the world; the usurers the money; the farmers eggs, butter, grain, barley, oats, apples, pears 2c. But the Christians must suffer, be persecuted, sit in towers where they have neither sun nor moon, be cast out into misery, be chased away and tormented. But it must certainly change one day, so it cannot last forever. Let us only be patient and remain steadfast in the pure doctrine, hold firmly to it, and therefore not fall away from it. 


32. God's and the devil's lawyering. 


Our Lord God and the devil have two different practices, which do not agree, but are even contrary to each other. Our Lord God's words first frighten, then straighten and comfort again. And this is so that the flesh, or the old man, may be killed, and the spirit, or the new man, may live. So also the good angels first frighten, then they comfort again those who are frightened, as Luc. 1, 30. when Mary was frightened at the angel's speech, he comforted her and said: "Do not be afraid, Mary" 2c., and Cap. 2, 10. He said to the shepherds who were greatly afraid, "Fear not, behold, | proclaim great joy to you." 

But the devil turns it around, to God's displeasure, needs even a perverse way,

makes people safe and bold at first, so that they do wrong and sin without all fear, dread and terror; and not only persist in sins, but have joy and air in them, and think they are doing well. At last, however, when evil comes, or when there is a long way to go, it grieves and terrifies without measure; it causes a man either to die of great sorrow, or, because of an evil conscience, to kill himself at last, and to be left without all consolation in God's sight. Grace despairs. 


God, not money, sustains the world. 


(The first paragraph is contained in Cap. 76, § 28. The second paragraph is transferred to the same place). 


34. God's secret counsels are not to be known, nor are they to be pondered. 


(Contained in Cap. 2, § 8, the last two paragraphs.) 


God feeds the church. 


God creates and gives abundance to his church, feeds it; who else would preach the gospel and Christ? And if all princes and lords were enemies of God's word, the church could not last a day. But God also has some among the princes who honor Him and give shelter to the servants of the Word. Likewise, He also has some in the courts of godless princes, kings, bishops, etc., who serve and worship Him and prevent many plots and counsels of the wicked against the Gospel. 


God is the avenger and executioner. 

God punishes either Himself, or secretly, through poverty, a wicked wife, disobedient, ill-bred children, and other many and various ways: why then do you desire vengeance? 


(Here 8 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 12, § 46.) 


37. praise of the creatures. (Cordatus No. 1530.) 


God praises His creature because He says [Ps. 104:15], "That wine may gladden the heart of man, and bread may strengthen the heart of man." 


88 


(38) Only with God should one seek counsel and call upon Him in times of need. 


(Lauterbach, April 5, 1538, p. 58.) 


One brought a confused and almost impossible matter and asked Luther to promote it. Luther replied: | like to serve everyone in possible things. But the majesty of the Gospel is immeasurably great, which can help all things. If God would, we would seek it from God. But, alas, we rather seek counsel with men and Satan. And said of some men's wickedness, which asked counsel of the diviners, and blasohemed God; who fell into the punishment of the authorities. 


39. God's things go on slowly and weakly. (Lauterbach, November 17, 1538, p. 174. Follows Cap. 13, § 37.) 


Afterwards he read in the book of Campanus, which he had written with his own hand and which had been found in Munster, titled: "Against the Lutherans and all the world after the time of the apostles." When Bucer wondered about his whimsical, atrocious errors, Luther said: "Those most shameful evil-doers pursue all their things strictly, since God's cause is so weak. | have now twenty years always built and fought with God's word, has nevertheless trouble. Therefore Habakkuk, Cap. 4, 15: "Your horses walk in the mud of great waters, and the chariots are helped." There are bumps everywhere, the mud clings to the wheels; but they still go through, even though they are weak. 


40. God's wrath is the greatest when He is silent and does not speak to us. 


There is no greater wrath than when God is silent and does not speak to us, but lets us go and do as we please in our mind and being. As it is now with the Jews, that our Lord God is so harshly angry with them, and for fifteen hundred years does not let himself be remembered with a single word, nor a single moment.

As he threatened them in Ps. 81:9-13, saying, "Hear, my people, | will testify among you; Israel, you shall hear me, that there is no other God among you, and that you worship no strange god. | am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and let me fill it. But my people will not obey my voice, and Israel will not obey me. So | have left them in the stupor of their hearts, to walk after their counsel." They cried out and prayed with great earnestness and fervor, as their prayer books show. So if | could pray as they pray, | would give two hundred florins worth of books for it. | am surprised that God does not hear them. It is a great, unspeakable wrath. When they cry out now, our Lord God answers thus: When | preached and cried out, no one would hear; so now | do not hear either. You have despised my sermon of punishment; so now | will not hear you again. Prov. 1, 24. ff. 

Oh, dear God! rather punish with pestilence, Frenchmen and whatever other evil diseases there may be on earth, so that the warrior curses, before you remain silent. God says: | have stretched out my hand and cried out: Come here and listen 2c., you say: We will not do it. | send unto you my servants the prophets, Isaiam, Jeremiam 2c., saying, Hear ye them 2c. Yea, say they, we will smite them to death 2c. There ye have my son: Ei, we will crucify him 2c.

44. god's way when he wants to ruin a country. 1) (Cordatus No. 1370.) 


When God wants to destroy kingdoms, He first takes away wise people, that is, He makes them blind, then He also takes away power. 


45. One should not flee from God. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1382.) 


It must come to pass that God will not make us fear Him. For he who fears flees; but he who flees from God, to whom will he take refuge? 

2) We should indeed recognize sin and confess that we justly deserve his wrath, punishment and disgrace; but in times of need we should have recourse to him and seek help from him in the name of Christ, his dear Son, for otherwise he will lose his honor if we do not consider him to be our God in our hearts and make him a liar. Therefore we should not be afraid of him, but flee to him and call upon him in all our troubles; for the Scriptures say that he is present with us, and hears us even before we begin to cry out. 


God punishes and no one can escape from Him. (Cordatus No. 159.) 


It cannot be denied how godless the world is, which can be especially noticed from the fact that God has not only increased the punishments, but also ordered such heaps of punishers. For first he punishes himself. Then all parents and landlords, all authorities, schoolmasters, all executioners and many others, so that one can hardly enumerate all punishers correctly. But if you add the devil with his army, the number of punishers is infinite. But if you want to summarize briefly how little the world cares about even the most severe punishments of God, then only consider this, that people abuse all His punishments for daily curses,

which one wishes upon the other, not only in anger, but also in jest, saying: That thunder may smite thee; that the French may pass thee, and the like. 


(Here 5 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 2, § 106.) 


47. If God does not hold over us, it is done with us. 


We are nothing with all our gifts, no matter how great they may be, if God does not always hold over us: if he relies on us, then our wisdom, art, understanding 2c. is nothing. If he does not always sustain us, even the highest knowledge and the best theology that we may attain and have will be of no help to us. For when the hour of temptation comes, it is in a flash and very soon that the devil snatches us away by his cunning, yes, even the sayings, so that we should comfort ourselves, and sets before our eyes only the sayings of doom, with great innumerable heaps. 

Therefore, let us learn well and realize that where our Lord God withdraws His hand from us, we may very soon fall and go to the ground. As happened to St. Peter soon after the first concilio at Antioch, when St. Paul confronted him and publicly chastised him for his hypocrisy, so that he angered the weak Gentiles, Gal. 2:11 ff. For this reason, no one should boast and boast about his righteousness, piety, wisdom and other gifts that he has, but humble himself and pray with the apostles, saying, "Dear Lord, strengthen and increase our faith," Luc. 17:5. 


48. a different. 


D. Staupitz, the Augustinian vicarius in Germania, used to say rightly and well: "It would be unfortunate and dangerous for us to rely on our own strength, even if we were holy and the most learned and understood things in the best and most certain way. For it may well happen that even in what we know and understand to the very best of our ability, we may nevertheless fall short and err, not only for our own sake but also for that of others. 


92 Cap. 2. of god's works. § 48-56. 9H 


even to the great, noticeable harm of other people. 52. how god remains master. Therefore, it is necessary for us to study the Holy (Cordatus No. 182.) Scriptures and God's Word with the utmost diligence and humility, and to pray with all seriousness so that we do not lose the truth of the Gospel. 


Do you want to know how God remains the regent and master of people? The old he lames, and the young he blinds. So he remains master. 


49. God's bodily gifts are held in low esteem. God feeds all animals.

Carlstadt, Zwingli, the Pope, and yet do not feel it in their hearts. The Rotten prove this. If we did not misuse God's name, everything would go happily for us on earth, because everything goes badly for those who misuse it. 

We just want to be idolaters, as it was in the time of Ezekiel, so God was forced to say [Ezek. 20, 39.]: If you want to worship idols, worship them in the name of all devils. But it is according to this: | am the LORD your God, it is written: Whoever uses the name of God uselessly will be punished. 

We are very great sinners because, in sum, we do not believe. We must complain to God about this, and He Himself knows that we are His image, however we may be. But that we are sinners, and very great ones at that, we know by the fact that we often make Hima liar through unbelief and do not trust Him, since He says most truly: | am the Lord, your God. 


God wants to be praised in all languages. (Contained in Cap. 34, § 6.) 


58. God can be trusted less than people. 1) (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 506.) 


Fie on you for the devil and our flesh, that we cannot sincerely trust God, who promises and gives so great things. | Martin Luther trust my wife and each of you more than Christ, although | know for certain that none of you would allow him to be crucified for me 2c.

Our Lord God does as we do, he pretends to make it rain and does not; we pretend to become pious and do not. 


God nullifies human councils and plots. (Cordatus No. 471.) 


| can't govern myself and want to govern the world? | have also well prescribed God's articles and wanted to govern, but the pious God has let me go in his ass and my master has become nothing. 


61. To prove God wrong, He does not like that. (Cordatus No. 470.) 


Gross missteps and outward sins are easily forgiven by God, but to resist the [Holy] Spirit and make God a liar, God will resist. 


62. God knows well how to do it, much differently than we think, with his and our adversaries. 


God knows the counsels and suggestions of all hearts, and knows well how to make it work out for the best. Therefore, it is good that Zwingel, Carlstadt and such like groups and enthusiasts have been put to death, for we would not have preserved L.S. and other our neighbors. O, what a triumph should have been! O, how they would have locked themselves! Therefore God knows well how he should do to him. 


God is much kinder to us than a father is to his child.

God, yes, much less. For He has a kinder and gentler heart towards His faithful than a father and mother have towards their child, as God Himself says in the prophet Isaiah, Cap. 49:15, where he says: "Can a woman forget her child, and not have mercy on the son of her womb? Even if she forgets him, | will not forget you" 2c. But God must have patience with us. Well, he has put it there, yes, sent his only begotten Son into the flesh and let him become man, so that we should take care of the best for him. | think that Paul himself was an enemy to him, that he could not believe and love Christ as he would have liked. 


64. a different. 


When | think of the great majesty and mercy of God, | myself am frightened that God has lowered Himself so high. 


65. a different one. 


| think that God has as much to create and to do, that he makes a thing void again, 1) as that he creates and makes it. This is what D. Martinus said when the dung was thought of, and he continued: "I am surprised that the world has not long since been filled up to the heavens. 


66. God is a God of the lowly. (Contained in Cap. 26, § 39.)

God has a small group on earth. (Cordatus No. 550.) 

The fact that God hardly makes the tenth part of the people blessed is meant in the tenth of Moses. For the world is very wicked, and who would have believed that there would be so great ingratitude toward the gospel among our people?

69. creatures of God, as they are to the wicked. (Cordatus No. 23.) 


All creatures are both revealed and hidden to the wicked. They look at all creatures like a donkey looks at the rosemary that is poured out for him to eat. He thinks he is eating hay. But it [the creature] is also apparent to them, because they see it; but hidden, because they do not perceive the Creator in the creature. 


God is very pleased with the customs of all creatures. 


Our Lord God is pleased for us to eat, drink and be merry, therefore he has also created so many things that we should need them; only that we recognize and consider him to be a God and give thanks to him. For he would not have us say that he had not given us enough, and could not feed and satisfy our poor maggot sack. 


71. God has put great gifts into small, despised things. (Cordatus No. 102.) 


| am surprised that God has put such good and high medicine in the dirt. For pig dung, especially when taken warm from the pig in the hand, staunches the blood, horse dung helps against side stitches, 3) human dung heals all wounds. 


God can be known from the creatures. (Cordatus No. 94.) 


Animals were created so that we might learn from them to recognize living beings 4) and be afraid of them. Therefore Christ says

73. you should not talk God into it. (Cordatus No. 99. 100. 101.) 


| have often resented God's way; but now | do not talk him into it. 

Even though the wicked lead a very happy life, | do not envy them this, for it happens to them no differently than it does to the pig that is thrown into the pen and soon after that is slaughtered. Here belongs what Isaiah 1) says: "Fatten, fatten for the sacrifice" 2c. 

| am very hostile to the mercenaries and would rather live under the Turks or Tartars than under their protection. For even if they killed me, | would know by whom | had been murdered, namely by Turks, Christ's enemies. But who are they? 


God's wrath is greatest when He is silent. (Cordatus No. 107. 108.) 


Such great monstrosities of things and doctrines announce to the world not a small, but rather a very great upheaval. Evil things, if they are small, move me the most, but very big ones (like the scolding of Campanus against the Holy Spirit) not at all. With these | think: Let go, because this is too high for you. 

If | could, | would punish Christ's enemies most cruelly by far and take vengeance on them by remaining silent, and God Himself has no greater wrath than when He remains silent.

God punishes the authorities through the subjects. (Cordatus No. 147.) 


Princes and rulers of this world are called and are gods of the earth [Ps. 82, 1. 6.]. Therefore they are of the devil. The mob, however, is the devil because God sometimes does through it what He would otherwise do through the devil to punish the wicked, just as, when fear and reverence for the authorities is taken away from the hearts of the subjects, the mob becomes rebellious. Thus God used the mob, 2) to keep Christ alive longer, as the evangelists often say [Matth. 21, 46.]: "But they were afraid of the people." 


How God breaks and humbles human hope. (Cordatus No. 239. 3) 


Human hope is so great that God, in order to humble it, uses everything that is repugnant to man in creatures (even in man himself). The number of these things is so great that you cannot possibly count them. Or (if you can), count the mosquitoes and fleas, the mice and the poisonous worms! For this purpose he also uses all the wickedness of the devil. Yes, even God Himself, as often as He shows Himself to us otherwise than as a Father, does all this, or allows it to happen, so that He may break our hope and make us humble. 


Why did God create the wicked? (Contained in Cap. 3, § 32.) 


78. god's imprudence. (Cordatus No. 244.) 


God seems to have acted carelessly when he commanded that the world be governed by the word of truth, especially because he clothed the truth with the weak word of the cross. And the world does not want the truth, but its opposite,

not found in Isaiah. 


3) Cf. Cordatus No. 1614. 


100Cap . 2. of God's works. § 78-83. the lies. But this seems to be still more carelessly acted, that he offers this truth to such people, who still do not want to receive it of their own free will. For the world does not obey voluntarily, but hardly at last, forced by the greatest violence, and is kept from crime and ruled right only by the greatest harshness. But it absolutely abhors the cross and would rather have Satan's pleasures than Christ's cross. Therefore, the one who rules the world well is the devil, who alone understands this well and rules the world as it is worth, but he takes his governor to help him, that is the pope. There has never been a more respectable kingdom, nor a kingdom of which the world would be more worthy, than that of the pope. 


Satan with all his members, the wicked, resists God. (Cordatus No. 242.) 

Just as the devil is always contrary to our Lord God in all things, in word and in deed, so also all the wicked, who are certainly possessed by the devil, if not physically, then spiritually, set themselves against God. 


Why God does all good by means. 

God could well feed us without all our labor and means, but he will open his hand that it may be seen that he is a rich Lord; and yet all is a marvelous work of God, that we must say we have it all from him. For we see that some waters have fish where none have been planted; thus, in the little book that flows through my garden, there are fine pike, little pike, and when they are put into another water, they become great pike.

blessed. Pythagoras, the pagan philosopher, said that the movement of the stars makes a very lovely center and harmony, agreeing with each other; but people are now tired and weary of it through constant habit. It is the same with us: we have such beautiful creatures, but no one respects them, for they are quite mean. Philip once asked me to give him a seal from the Bible, but one that he would not tire of. You can't give a man something that he could love forever, so that he wouldn't get full and tired, because the devil wanted it. As you can see, sometimes whores and boys remain one and undivided, but husbands and wives can be divorced. So whores, stealing and all kinds of sin and disgrace, one can always do, but otherwise the good can not always love. The devil destroys the works of God, and Christ destroys the works of the devil: these are two abominable things, the seed of the woman and the serpent. 


God feeds all men and creatures in the whole world. 


How much do you think there are people who buy bread? | consider that a farmer waits the least time of the grain 2c.; otherwise he perishes with his wood, barley, brew 2c. Item, the third part of the fields hardly bears grain, nor are we fed. 

My father once said to me: He did not believe that so many sheaves would grow as there were men on earth: but | believe that more sheaves grow; but | do not believe that so many almond grains grow as there are men. But one almond yields scarcely a bushel; a man cannot live on it all the year, and yet all are fed; indeed, there is still grain left when the year is over. This is a strange thing, in which we should feel God's grace and blessing. 


Our Lord God must be wrong, he does what he wants and how he wants. That God should pass such a harsh, severe judgment on Adam, because he had been deceived by the 


102 


The man who had eaten the tree offered to him and had disobeyed God, namely, that the field should be cursed for his sake, and that for his sake the whole human race should be subjected to all kinds of tribulations, fears, hardships, diseases, plagues, and at last death should be sent upon it: this seems to be too severe and hard to the wise mind (if it regards the work, namely the biting of the apple, as a bad, small thing); it opens its mouth and says, or thinks, "Oh, is it a great thing and a sin for a man to eat an apple? Is it then a great thing and sin that one eats of an apple? Just as it is now said of such sins as God has expressly forbidden in His Word, especially of drunkenness and gluttony, and others: What harm is it that one is merry and drinks with good fellows? Therefore, according to her blindness, she concludes from this that God has done too much to him, that he is too strict and is trying too hard. 

Again, she is offended and angry that Christ lets go of pious, honorable, holy people (as she thinks), does not want to know them, leads them harshly, yes, rejects them and calls them evildoers, although some have been proven wise in his name, cast out devils and performed miracles, Matth. 7, 22, who hear his word and believe in him, forgives their sins, covers them up, does not want to impute them, as great and many as they are, makes them pious, righteous and holy, children of God and heirs of eternal life and blessedness, out of pure grace, without all their merit, good works and worthiness; that also seems too much, even unjust. 

Who can be Scheidemann here, who can rhyme the two things together, which are as much against each other as fire and water, namely the strictest and most severe law, which God exercises against the innocent (as reason knows), and the all too great kindness and gentleness, which he shows to sinners, does not impute their iniquity to them, but accepts it with grace 2c.? Human reason with its wisdom becomes a fool, therefore it is said: "Unless you turn around and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven", Matth. 18, 3. 


Cap: 2. of God's works. § 83. 84. 


103 


God in His majesty is incomprehensible to human reason; therefore, one should be satisfied with the provision and not be troubled by it. 1) 


Human reason and nature cannot comprehend God in His majesty, therefore we should not seek nor inquire further into what is God's will, nature and essence, except as He has commanded us. He has given us His word, in which He has abundantly revealed what we should know about Him, what we should think about Him, what we should believe, and what we should do with Him: we should judge ourselves by it, so that we cannot err. But he who has thoughts of God's will, nature and being apart from the Word, and wants to reason it out with human reason and wisdom, causes him much vain trouble and labor, and falls far short; for "the world," says St. Paul, "through its wisdom does not know God in His wisdom," 1 Cor. 1:21. 

Nor will they ever learn or know what God's mind is toward them, who worry in vain whether they are endowed or chosen. Those who fall into these thoughts have a fire in their heart that they cannot quench, so that their conscience is not satisfied, and they must finally despair. 

Whoever then wants to escape this misfortune and eternal danger, must keep to the Word, and he will find that our dear God has made and laid a strong, firm foundation, on which we may safely and securely stand, namely Jesus Christ our Lord, 1 Cor. 3:11, through whom alone, in vain, by no other means, we must enter the kingdom of heaven; for He, and no one else, "is the way, the truth and the life," John 14:6. 

If we are to know God rightly and truly in his divine nature and how he is disposed towards us, it must be through his word. And for this very reason God the Father sent His only begotten Son into the world to become man, to dwell among us in the likeness of all things, yet without sin, and to make the Father's heart and will known to us.

104 Cap. 2. of God's works. § 84. 85. 105 


as the Father has ordained and appointed him to be our teacher, when he cries from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, ... whom you shall hear," Matth. 17, 5. As if he wanted to say: "It is in vain and for nothing that men undertake to search for my divine majesty; human reason and wisdom cannot grasp me, | am far too high and great for them. Now, | will make myself small enough for her to grasp and take hold of me: | will give her my only begotten Son, and so give him that he shall become a sacrifice, yes, a sin anda curse for her, and in this he shall render obedience to me until death, yes, death on the cross. After this | will preach it in all the world, and those who believe in it will be saved. This is what St. Paul means when he says 1 Cor. 1, 21: "Because the world through its 


that apart from Christ, God will be unknown and ungraspable. 

Do you want to know why so few are saved and so many are condemned? This is the reason that the world does not want to listen, ask nothing about it, even despise that he, the Father, testifies about him: "This is my beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased,” Matth. 3, 17. As if he should say: With him alone you shall find what and who | am and what | want, otherwise you will find it neither in heaven nor on earth. If ye therefore believe on the Son, whom | have sent unto you for a Saviour, | will be a Father; and what this Son saith and promiseeth, it shall surely be true and amen; | will not suffer him to be a liar. 2 Cor. 


wisdom did not recognize God in His wisdom, it), 49 90, 


pleased God through foolish preaching to save those who believe in it. 

This means that the divine majesty is small and understandable, so that no one should or can complain that he does not know how he should relate to God. But the world is blind and deaf, which neither sees nor hears what God speaks and does through His Son; therefore He will also demand it of them, Deut. 18, 19. 

There is no better way to seek, find and understand the grave challenge of eternal providence or election, which grieves many people, than in the wounds of Christ, 1) of whom the Father said and commanded us: "Him you shall hear", Matth. 17, 5. The Father in his divine majesty is too high and great for us that we cannot grasp him, therefore he shows us the right way so that we can surely come to him, namely Christ, and says: "If you believe in him and cling to him, you will find out who | am and what my nature and will are. But this is not done by the wise, the mighty, the learned, the saints, and the greatest multitude in all the world. That is why God is and remains unknown to them, no matter how much they think about him, argue and talk about him. 


ll Cf. cap. 26, § 75. 


From this it certainly follows that all who subject themselves to and strive to come to God by any other means than through Christ (as Jews, pagans, Turks, papists, false saints, heretics, 2c.) walk in abominable darkness and error. And do not help them that they lead an honorable, strict life outwardly, pretend great devotion, do and suffer much, love and honor God; as they boast. For since they do not want to hear Christ, nor believe in him, without whom no one knows God, no one receives forgiveness of sins and grace, no one comes to the Father, they remain forever in doubt and unbelief, do not know how they are with God, and must finally die and perish in their sins. For "he who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him", Joh. 5, 23. "And he who denies the Son does not have the Father either", 1 Joh. 2, 23. "He who does not believe the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him", Joh. 3, 36. 


Why God has decreed that the wicked shall prosper and the righteous shall be iniquitous in the world. (Cordatus No. 875.) 


| do not understand the argument myself, that the peelers have such good days and the pious have such bad days. But God does like a good householder, who chastises the son and not the servant, to whom he does not give the inheritance. 


106 


but to the son. And the dearer children are, the greater ruth; it [the child] nevertheless remains in the house. But the servant, though he do too much [evil], yet the Lord remembereth, he shall not do it long in my house. But the Baptist had to die so shamefully that one may lament. This is how it is on earth, but it will get better, and Judas also had good days for a while, but he died badly. 


(The conclusion of this § is contained in § 59 of this Cap.). 


Why God decrees that His people be persecuted by the devil and the world. (Cordatus No. 1372. 1373. 1374.) 


God is never angry or we would be lost, He does not strike, only that He allows it and turns a blind eye, as a father allows his child to be struck by another, and yet even by this admission He only wants to entice us to come to God. 

In the book of Judges [Cap. 10, 14. 15.] the angel says very beautifully: So often | have beaten you and you have not improved, - | believe this happened under Gideon. Whoever surrenders to the man and trusts that he will help, he will certainly help him. The only thing wrong is that we cannot surrender to him. Since the people say, "Do with us as you will," he has always delivered them. Just as David, when he counted the people, was not beaten, because he humbly asked God for chastisement and bowed under the punishment [2 Sam. 24:16, 17]. For to have mercy on the afflicted is" his deity, for who else would come to him, praise him and call upon him? For in hell no one confesses him [Ps. 6, 6]. 

The devil can murder and make sad, but God is a God of life and of comfort for the afflicted. Whoever does not know this, does not know God. God is not the devil, but simply God. Indeed, "GOtt" is a double- meaning word. For in one way it is said: GOtt of death, of sin 2c. In the other way is also: GOtt of the good. He who does not distinguish here is very mistaken, for ambiguity is the mother of error. 


Cap. 2. of god's works. § 85-88. 





107 


God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. 


This saying allegorizes and draws on Christ, Matthew 22:32, and proves powerfully from it the resurrection of the dead. For if there is no hope of resurrection, nor of another and better life after this short and miserable life, wny does God claim to be our God, to give us everything that is useful and beneficial, and finally to save us from all distress, both physical and spiritual? What is the use of hearing his word and believing in him? What good are we if we sigh and cry out to him in anguish and distress, patiently await his comfort and salvation, praise his grace and good deeds displayed in Christ, and thank him for them? Why do we daily stand in danger, let ourselves be persecuted, killed for the sake of Christ's word, which we teach to hold as our greatest treasure and to confess before the wicked world? 

But because the eternal, merciful God speaks and acts through His Word and Sacraments with us humans alone (all other creatures excluded), not about bodily things or this temporal, transitory life (which He abundantly provided with all necessities in the beginning), but where we are to dwell when we depart, and gives us his Son to be our Saviour, who hath redeemed us from sin and death, and hath purchased for us eternal righteousness, life and blessedness, that we should believe on him, and be baptized at his command 2c.It is certain that we will not die like unreasonable animals, but if we have fallen asleep in Christ, we will be raised to eternal life through Him on the last day, but the wicked to judgment, eternal shame and disgrace, John 5:29, Dan 12:2. 


God needs evil for good. 


God only needs everything very well, whereas man and the devil shamefully misuse everything good. God drives to the state of marriage through secret suffering and lust, 1 Cor. 7; for if one man did not have love, lust and desire for another, who would want to be free? But that after that forbidden air is controlled 


108 Cap. 2. of God's works 


that the man does not attach himself to a stranger, but rejoices in his wife and delights in her love; so also the woman. Through ambition God drives many things, so that they strive for good and honor, have a great reputation in the world, are raised to high status before others, to regents, councils, etc.; who would otherwise let himself be used for this? But ambition must not leave the circle of its command and rule, but remain within it, not seeking that which is not its own, nor doing harm to its subjects and neighbors; for there must be an inclination and desire for it. Through avarice God forces many to consider how they will feed themselves; otherwise, without such a desire to have something of one's own, who would want to work and let it sour him to get food? Yes, all possessions and goods would decay and dissolve, only that avarice would also be kept in its circle. Through fear, trembling and doubting, God drives many to faith, so that they keep God's promise, comforting themselves in Christ, who reconciled sinners to God, so that they, justified by faith, have peace with God, Rom. 5, 1. Except for pride and envy, which are and remain evil, devilish vices. But God also uses them for good, but in a contrary way, not in those who are tainted and blinded by them, but in those who are persecuted by the arrogant and the envious. For thus God works His saints for their good, through the devil and his members. On the other hand, the wicked Satan abuses God and all that is good: chastity and celibacy, for hypocrisy; humility, for spiritual hope; love, for mobs and riots; goods, for splendor and idleness. 


God does not lack him anywhere. 


God gives us all kinds of abundant things to enjoy, first of all so that no one may complain that he has not provided enough for us to maintain this life. But that there is sometimes a lack, especially at this last time, is not his fault, but the fault of the unholy miser, who snatch up everything for themselves, buy all kinds of goods, increase their pleasures, and take away the good things. 


. § 88-91. 109 Translate and complain to my husband; keep silent about the shameful usurers who suck the people dry. On the other hand, that God may rightly and justly inflict punishment in His time on those who not only do not recognize Him nor are obedient to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but are also not grateful to Him for the bodily benefits that He gives them abundantly to enjoy (not for splendor, abundance, pride 2c.), yes, misuse them most shamefully against God and to the harm and destruction of their neighbor. But now God desires nothing else from us for all his benefits, bodily and spiritual, but a Deo gratias, that we recognize him as our God and Father, obey his word, serve him in faith, call upon him in all our distress, and do not doubt that he will hear us for Christ's sake. 


90. Giving thanks is God's dearest service. 


God likes it, it is also the dearest, most pleasant service for him, that he is praised. But he is not praised, he is loved first. He is not loved, unless he is gentle and does good. But he does good when he is gracious. He is merciful when he forgives sin. Who then are they that love him? The small group of believers who recognize such grace and know that they have forgiveness of sins through Christ. The children of the world are not concerned with this, they serve their idol, the wretched and shameful Mammon, but he will finally reward them badly. 


God is pleased that we need His creatures. 


(Here § lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 2, § 70.) 

When grapes, nuts, and peaches 2c. were placed on the table after the meal, and everyone ate them with pleasure, he said, "What does our Lord God above in heaven say about our sitting here like this and eating his goods? Well, he created it so that we should use it; he does not demand anything else of us, except that we recognize that these are his goods and enjoy them with thanksgiving.

110Cap 


God fills the belly of the wicked, but gives the kingdom of heaven to the godly. 


We do not believe that our Lord God will give more and better than to the rich wicked in the world, to whom he gives delicious good wine (he said this, since he once had a good pure drink of wine), yes, money, property, honor, power and everything they only desire and want to have, only superfluously. But the best good (which they also do not desire) he denies them, namely, himself. But whoever does not have God, even if he has whatever else he wants, he is poorer and more miserable before God than Lazarus, who lay at the rich man's door and died of hunger because of him, Luc. 16, 19. ff. But it will happen to them, as it did to the rich man, that they will be eternally destitute, so that they will not be able to drink even the smallest drop of water. 

But if the rich, mild God frequently showers His worst enemies and blasphemers with all kinds of temporal goods, and also gives some great ones, and many of them, dominions and kingdoms, we can easily deduce from this what He will give us, His children (who must suffer for His sake), indeed, what He has already given us. But he has given us his only begotten Son, and with him he has given all things, so that through him we are God's children, heirs also of his eternal heavenly goods, and joint heirs with Christ according to hope, Rom. 8:16, 17, 32. 


How God shares with the world. 


Our Lord God has divided unequally with the world, that is, he has given to the world all creatures on earth, in the water and in the air, and subjected them to it, so that it should rule over fish in the sea, over birds under the sky and over all animals that are on earth, Ps. 115:16. But he has kept heaven for him, so that he is Lord over life and death: if he wanted to sell the two, he would soon bring back to himself all the goods and treasures that he has given to the world. 


94. Because God gives all goods for free, people do not pay attention to them. 


(Composed of Cap. 2, §13 and 214.) 


95. God's love even against the evil one. 


God is gracious and merciful, as the Scriptures praise Him, because He can love the wicked; indeed, to the blind, hardened world that is in trouble, He has sent His Son as Savior. | could not do it, and yet | am a knave myself. 


God watches the tyrants for a long time. 


God is patient and of great kindness that He can be so silent and watch the Pope and the Turks, His worst enemies, for so many hundred years and let them go unpunished. Little knows the cause of such cruel and severe punishment, for no one believes that God so terribly punishes the blindness of the damned world, which does not want to accept the truth or cannot suffer long to be saved, but blasohemes and persecutes it: "Therefore God also sends you strong errors, so that they believe the lies," 2 Thess. 2, 11. 

In the apostles’ time and long after, the gospel had its full course in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Asia, Graecia, 2c., and other kingdoms now held by the Turkish tyrant. But as the people grew weary of it, and many heresies arose, the blasohemous Mahomet came with his Koran. From that time on, they abandoned Christ and worshiped the devil Mahomet. The same happened under the papacy. After our time the punishment will also go over Germany and others, because of the horrible ingratitude and contempt of the dear blessed Word, which is preached to them purely and abundantly. And after this bright light will come a dreadful, terrible darkness. May Christ comfort and help his little army and put an end to their misery through his glorious future. Amen. 


God forgives the punishment for a time. 


Our Lord God sees very well how the dogs throw, piss, spit and make all corners full of filth. Item, how the drunkards throw out jugs, glasses to windows, break bowls, plates, glasses, windows, stove, and so 


112 


break 2c. But when he begins to visit, he is cruelly angry and punishes without end or measure. This is what he said about the wild, impolite, sour behavior and life that great lords, kings, princes, the nobility, but especially the pope, cardinals, bishops, canons, and the entire corrupt house, with all their fornication and other abominable sins, are unashamedly committing at this last time, without all fear and timidity. 

The infant Jesus, he said (pointing with his hand to the painting on the wall), sleeps on the arm of the Mother Mary: will he wake up one day, he will truly ask us what we have done and how we have done it? 


98. signs, so go before the punishment. 


When God wants to punish or even destroy a kingdom, country or people, 1) He first takes away pious, godly teachers and preachers; item, wise, godly rulers and councilors, reasonable and experienced warriors, and other honest people, Isa. 3, 2. ff. Then the mob becomes secure and cheerful, drives all courageous will, asks nothing more about pure divine teaching, yes, despises it and falls into blindness, respects neither punishment, discipline nor respectability, commits all kinds of sins and shame, from which follows a wild, desolate, devilish nature; as we, unfortunately, now see and experience that may not last long. Therefore, | fear that the axe has already been laid at the root of the tree, so that it will soon be cut down. May the good Lord take us away with grace, so that we do not have to experience or see the misery. 


99. How God respects great lords. 


God regards the great potentates, kings, princes 2c. in the same way as the children of a card game: because they play, they have the card hands in their hands; afterwards, when they get tired of the game, they throw them into a corner under the bench, or into the garbage. God does the same with potentates and great lords: because they are in power, he considers them good; as soon as they have over-

The King of Denmark 2) has been captured, his wife has died, his son has died at Regensburg. These are certainly great deeds of God, and yet no one takes them to heart. 


100. Our Lord's Map. 


God has a beautiful, glorious and very strong card game of vain powerful, great lords, as emperors, kings, princes 2c., read together; beats one with the other. Of which | could tell many examples that have happened in our time alone 2c. 

The Pope has now been considered the supreme head of Christianity for several hundred years: if he has only waved a finger, emperors, kings, princes 2c. have had to fear, humble and stoop before him: has thus been a lord over all kings on earth, yes, an earthly god. Now our Lord God comes and strikes with the dew (Luther), the pope, the great king, so that he lies there. This is our Lord God's regiment, as Mary sings in the Magnificat: Deposuit potentes: "He sets the mighty ones from the throne", Luc. 1, 52. 


Another speech from God's map. 


If | were rich, | would have a golden chess and silver carls made for me, as a reminder: for God's chess and card are great, mighty princes, kings, emperors, 2c., since he always stabs one through the other, or beats, that is, lifts up and overthrows. N. is the four bells, the pope the six bells, the Turk the eight bells, the emperor is the king in the game. Finally, our Lord God comes, divides the game, beats the Pope with the Luther, who is his dew. But he is not dead yet; Christ has begun to kill him with the spirit of his mouth, so that 


2) Christian II was imprisoned in 1532; his wife, Isabella of Spain, sister of Emperor Carl V, had died in 1525. His son John died in 1532, the year to which this speech probably belongs. (Wr.)

pope. For when God gives the Word, He also gives the Spirit of grace and prayer at the same time. When this is strong in the hearts of the faithful, the world is defeated, the devil is overcome and judged, who cannot stand the Word, yes, is in his eyes like thick smoke and dark mist. Now, be it as it may, it cannot be long before both Pope and Turk with their followers are cast into the abyss of hell. Amen. 
















God's works are wonderful. (This § to the last paragraph [Lauterbach, p. 87, note] in Kummer p. 377.) 

The creatures of God are inscrutable, yet in truth hey are signs 2) of God to the pious. The sun rises aily, the rain moistens, serves the grateful and the ngrateful. As Christ has finely amplified Matth. 6, so Il fruit grows out of the trees; as it were, flesh comes ut of the wood. For what are trees but wood? If you oil them or roast them, they are wood, but they are lesh; the sweetest fruits that smell like flesh come out f them. So | saw in Italy the most fruitful oil trees tanding on the hardest rocks. There | learned to nderstand the Psalm (78, 15.): "He satiated them out f the rock with water, "b) Thus God blesses our Saxon and, which after all is only broken stone, according to he Gospel (Matth. 4, 3.): "Say that these stones ecome bread.” But these miracles, because they appen frequently and daily, are held in low esteem, s Augustine says.

Of this once said D. M. Luther over the table and said: From Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the patriarchs and holy fathers, come the Jews who have crucified Christ; from the apostles come Judas the betrayer; from Alexandria, where there was a famous noble school and had many pious, Christian, learned men, come Arius and Origen; from the Roman church, which has given many holy martyrs, comes the blasphemous Antichrist, the Pope of Rome; from the hermits in Arabia comes Mahomet; from Constantinople, the noble city where many noble emperors held court, comes the wretched Turk; from wives come f Las waar hares ‘ adulteresses; from virgins whores; from brothers, "Ce said: Landiken, Landiken, you are a Sandiken, if sons, friends become the worst enemies; from angels} WOrk thick, you are light, if | work thick, you are come devils; from kings tyrants; from the gospel andpimple, if | work thick, | do not find. 4) Nevertheless, divine truth come devilish lies; from the church{@°d gives us good wine and delicious grain from these heretics.

God spends a great deal of money on the birds’ food and nourishment, so He wills it. also feed, nourish and sustain people. (Cordatus No. 192. 1766.) 


No one is able to measure the treasures that God spends on feeding the birds alone, and very uselessly at that. | believe, however, that it is more precious to God to maintain the sparrows for a year than the annual income of the king of France. What shall we say of the others, which are larger and more voracious? 

Although the sparrows are the worst birds, they still have the best days of the year and do the most damage. In winter they lie in the barns and grain floors, in spring they eat the seed, in summer the best grain from the ears, in autumn they are in the vineyards, worthy of persecution. These are all human sins. But when they come into the churches, they hinder GOD and the hearers from saying. [This is devilish sin.] 


God's wrath will soon be atoned for. (Cordatus No. 860.) 


If God is angry with one, the matter is well advised, because He is merciful; but whoever, when challenged, is angry with God, the matter cannot be helped. [Hab. 4, 2.] 


107. merciful punishment of God. 


If God is angry with us, fights for us, hands us over into the hands of our enemies, so that he can punish our sin and iniquity through them, lets pestilence, evil times and other plagues come upon us, but still speaks to us through his word, then it is certainly a sign of his grace toward us.

who, seeing now that everyone wants to be Christian and evangelical, and yet there is no measure to the care of the belly, the grievous avarice, usury, and other sins, and God prevails through pious, faithful servants and preachers 2c., it is a sure sign that God will soon take away the word and pure doctrine and leave the people in their heart of hearts to walk according to their counsel, and, as Christ foretold the Jews in Matt. 21:43, "the kingdom of God will be taken from them and given to others who bear its fruit. Then follows the destruction, that kingdoms, countries and people are devastated and destroyed 2c. 

Therefore, | am afraid and anxious that Germany will also be afflicted and horribly punished in a short time because of the great ingratitude (on our side), contempt and blasphemy of the dear word (on the enemy's side), which God lets shine so clearly and abundantly in these dangerous last times. He can bear patience for a long time when people are wicked; but when they despise and persecute His word, patience is out and the final punishment is in place; as happened with the Jews, Greeks, Romans 2c. 


Our Lord God's servant. 


D. M. Luther said: God wants repentant sinners (who fear God's wrath, devil, death and hell, and believe in Christ) to be servants: therefore David says in the 34th Psalm, v. 19: "The Lord is near to those who are brokenhearted. And helpeth them that are of a broken spirit." And in Isaiah, Cap. 66, 1. 2. itis said, "Where shall my spirit rest, and where shall | dwell? With them that are bruised in heart, and fear my words." This is what the poor thief on the cross did; St. Peter, who denied Christ; Mary Magdalene, who was possessed by devils; St. Paul, the persecutor; all of whom were sorry for their sins and wanted to have forgiveness of sins from Christ and to be God's servants. The great prelates, proud saints, rich noblemen, ox drivers and house builders do not do it, 1 Cor. 1:26, nor would it be good, because no poor person could come before them,

Thus, God always begins by laying the first stone, that is, the word of promise and grace must precede it. This annoys the papists and all the works saints when they hear this, and prevents them from accepting it, but persecutes it; for they do not know and do not understand that the grace by which God justifies us in Christ is the forgiveness of sins, and even though there is still sin left, God does not want to impute it to us for the sake of faith in Christ. Alas! To know Christ is the highest treasure, of which the world knows nothing, even despises Him. It is like John wrote in Cap. 1, 5: "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not understood it. 


Two kinds of sacrifices pleasing to God. 


Scripture indicates two sacrifices that are pleasing and acceptable to God: The first is called a sacrifice of thanksgiving or praise, when one purely teaches, preaches, hears, accepts with faith, confesses, and does everything that serves to spread God's word, and for the unspeakable benefits that are presented to us through it and given to us in Christ, thanks, praises, and glorifies God from the heart. Psalm 50:14 speaks of this: "Offer sacrifices of thanksgiving to God"; item v. 23: "He who offers thanksgiving praises me. And Psalm 118, 1.: "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is kind, and his goodness endures forever." And Psalm 103:1: "Praise the LORD, O my soul, and what is within me, his holy name. Praise the LORD, my soul, and forget not what good he hath done thee." 

The other is when a troubled, afflicted heart takes refuge in God in all kinds of trials and distress, calls upon Him in right faith, seeks help from Him and waits with patience, Ps. 118:5: "In anguish | called upon the Lord, and the Lord heard me and comforted me." Ps. 34, 19.: "The LORD is near to them that are of a broken heart, and helpeth them that are of a bruised spirit." Ps. 51, 19.: "The sacrifices that please GOD are a troubled spirit; a troubled and bruised heart You, GOD, will not despise." Ps. 50, 15.: "Call upon me in distress, and | will deliver thee, and thou shalt praise me." 


The perverse wisdom of the epicureans of this age, of whom there are many, and more and more every day, who judge God's regiment. 


When an Epicurean has thoughts of God and sees that things are so unequal and evil in the world that the pious suffer hardship and are oppressed, while wicked wretches have everything superfluous and soar high, he cannot conclude otherwise than that God cannot forbid and prevent this disorderly and desolate being in the world, then he is a poor, weak God; not powerful, much less omnipotent, as he is praised. But if he does not want to change, prevent or forbid it, then he is an unkind, even unjust God, who takes pleasure and joy in it when things go bad. But if he does not know how things are in the world, he is an inconsiderate, unwise, even foolish God. 

So lead to school and master the blind condemned race God, their Lord and Creator, deprives and robs him of his divine power, justice and wisdom.

When one said, "He who serves God and the emperor has little profit," Luther said earnestly, "This is from hell and from the devil's behind, and is blasphemous speech, which goes directly against the first and other tablets. Against the first, where God commands: "You shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might", Deut. 6, 5, "and serve Him alone", Matth. 4, 10.

The first birth was sanctified to God. 


In the Old Testament, all firstborns were sacred to God, both of men and of cattle. The firstborn son had an advantage over the other brothers, and was their lord as the chief in sacrifice and kingdom, that is, in spiritual and temporal government; for he had the right to priesthood and dominion. Now many examples are given in the Scriptures, showing how God rejected the firstborn sons and chose others in their place. As, Cain, Ishmael, Esau, Reuben, Eliab 2c. were firstborn sons: from them God took their right and gave it to their brothers who were younger than they, as, Abel, Isaac, Judah, David 2c., and that therefore: they became proud and presumptuous over the firstborn and despised their brothers who were more pious and godly than they. God did not like this and therefore deprived them of their honor, so that they could not boast of their firstborn before Him, even though they had a great reputation before the world, land and people; as the Scriptures report. 

But the spiritual promise, that Christ should come from their seed, they have forgotten through their pride, that they might not boast of their firstborn according to the flesh. Our Lord God wants to be unpunished, to let us go our way in no way: whoever does not walk in his way goes astray and is a lost sheep. 


118) Obedience of God and the devil. 1) 


The obedience that is rendered to God and pleases Him is the obedience of faith, Rom. 3:28, that one hears and teaches His word, believes it, abides by it and proves it with fruits of faith, that is, with good works that God has commanded. But obedience to the devil is superstition, so that a person departs from the true faith, follows devil's lies and the teachings of men, and does many and great works.

Drought. When there was a great drought, so that the seeds and plants dried up before they were ripe, the Lord Doctor asked that the Lord, for the sake of His mercy, would give rain 2c. While he was still speaking in this way, locusts (druelii, /3/wiot) came flying into the garden in droves, and he said, "God is angry, because he also wants to take away the rest through vermin, as Joel 1, (v. 4.) says: The caterpillars will eat the rest 2c. At last he sighed and said; Oh Lord, behold our prayer, for thy promises’ sake. We have asked him, our heater sighs, but the peasants' avarice hinders it, after they have become so licentious through the gospel, that they do what they desire, and are not frightened, neither by hell nor purgatory, but say: I believe, I will be blessed, and become the most shameful mammon servants; he wants these godless people to perish by hunger. But GOD does have means to feed His own, although He denies the rain to the ungodly. For GOD has various means to sustain and to destroy. For at that time of drought many locusts came, and he said that with such an army GOtt could smite the Turk. For one reads in church history that a very large army of the Persians was chased away with gnats before Nineveh*). 


*) Cf. Cap. is, § 41: "Nasili" (Nineveh?); also because of the time indication. 


124 Cap. 2. of God's works 


The strange army sent by God, namely by flies and gnats, was defeated with all its might at the city of Edessa. Thus our Lord God desires to conquer and triumph, not by might, but by weakness: gnats shall smite the great king, and chase the mighty, ravenous beast. So also, a weak man shall defy, resist and overcome the prince and God of the world by faith. 


The world does not respect God's goods. 


God deceives the world and makes it foolish, because he does so much good even to the worst of the wicked, gives rain from heaven and _ fruitful seasons, out of the earth grain, wine and all kinds of fruit, yes, also gold and silver and other metals, out of the sea rmd water all kinds of fish, fills their hearts also with delicious food and drink and makes them happy. The world does not think otherwise, because their goods are the right goods, their joy is the right joy. 

Therefore let us cling to the word, hold fast to it, and judge ourselves according to the same, which teaches us that all things, with which the world is about, glories, and comes in with, are temporal, defiled, and worldly, and have no continuance, but perish with all their nature, goods, joy, pleasure 2c., And also shew what are the true and lasting goods and joy 2c., namely, the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which are a better and more precious treasure than many thousand pieces of gold or silver. 

So | hear, we cannot use this world's goods, joy 2c. without sin? | do not say that, because God created it for us to use and enjoy it, according to this rule of St. Paul, 1 Cor. 7, 29, 30, 31: "Dear brothers, the time is short. Further, this is the opinion: that they have wives, as if they had none; and that they weep, as if they meant none; and that they rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and that they buy, as if they possessed none; and that they have need of this world, that they abuse it not, for the things of this world perish."

123. God's supreme wrath and mercy. 


False teachers and_ idolatrous spirits are punishments of sins and God's greatest wrath and disfavor, as Hosea Cap. 9, 7. says: "The prophets are fools, and the idolatrous spirits are mad because of your great iniquity and because of hostile idolatry." Just as godly teachers are a glorious testimony to God's grace and mercy. Therefore St. Paul Eph. 4, 8. 11. calls the apostles, evangelists, prophets, shepherds and teachers gifts of the Lord Christ, sitting at the right hand of God the Father, and Micah compares the teaching of the Gospel to a fruitful rain.

God hardens whom He wills. 


One asked D. Martinum whether the word "harden" is to be understood actually, as it reads, or figuratively and falsely? Then he answered and said: Proprie, actually, one should understand it, but not really; because God works and does no evil, but by his omnipotence he works everything in everything, and as he finds a man, so he works in him. Like Pharaoh, who was evil by nature, that was not God's fault, but his own, when he continued to be evil and to do evil. But he is hardened because God, with His Spirit and grace, does not prevent his wicked ways, but lets him continue and have his way. But why God does not hinder or prevent him, we do not have to ask, because the little word "why" has deceived and killed many souls. It is too high for us to investigate. 

Therefore God says: "Why | am doing this, you shall not know; see you on your word,

What that is, experience teaches us now; for one drowns, hangs, scorches, burns, beheads, strangles 2c., chases away, stabs and plows 2c. And they do it all in defiance of God.

The old lord of Stolberg, after he had come back from the holy land, which he had seen quite well, is said to have said: Is this the promised land? | would take the golden floodplain for it. For even the holy land is no longer as fertile as it was before. 


God's blessings are upon all creatures. 


God has blessed the creatures along with us humans who have mouths and need food that grows from the earth, but he has not blessed those who come from the earth themselves. For we eat in like manner that which the swine and other unwise beasts eat, only that we put it boiled into the dish and dress it, but the swine bites it from the root. 


How God will judge. 


God's judgment is happening now through the gospel, but on the last day it will be revealed and made public. Then He will come with thunder and lightning, and in a moment He will send all of us to meet Him, 1 Thess. 4:17, so that we will have to stand before Him and publicly hear the judgment, Matth. 25:34, 41. This is called judging the living and the dead. 


The first time you see God's goodness, you will know it. 


The worldly authority is a sign of divine grace, that God is merciful, and has neither desire nor pleasure in slaughtering and strangling, otherwise he would let it all go among themselves without regiment, also among the Turks and other nations, like the wild, cruel, unreasonable animals, pigs, bears, wolves, lions 2c.Then they would destroy themselves and devour one another,’ according to the saying, 'He who is strong and able puts another in his sack.

And when someone asked: What is the reason why the pope and his followers hold so stiffly to such doctrines of the devil?

This makes him mock our preaching and worship, because we are beggars in it and have to suffer a lot. But he lifts up his worship to heaven, for there he has money and goods, honor and authority, and is a great lord who can be emperor and king.

It does not little affect the hearts that God is so changeable 2). For to Adam he gave promises and ceremonies, which he then changed with the rainbow 3) and the box of Noah. To Abraham he gave circumcision. To Moses miraculous signs; to his people the law. He abolished all of them through the Gospel, which he gave to Christ. The Turks were offended by this changeability of God and said that their law would only last for a while, but would then be changed.

Cap. 2. of God's works. §149-157.

How difficult it is to believe what God says. 


Alas! said D. Martinus, | believed everything the pope and the monks said, but what Christ says now, who does not lie, | cannot believe. That is a miserable and annoying thing. Well, we want it and must save it until that day. 


155. a different. (Cordatus No. 1516.) 


Is it not a plague that | am afraid of the man who raised me out of baptism, when no Philip nor Pomeranian loves me so much as Christ, who died for me? 


God cares for us. (Cordatus No. 1800.) 


Since God spends so much on feeding useless birds, who would despair that he will be sustained by God? 


What this is, God is nothing, and yet everything. 


The pagan Plato disputes about God, that God is nothing, and yet is everything: which Eck and the Sophists followed, and yet understood nothing of it; as their words indicate, which no one could understand. But so it is to be understood and spoken of: God is incomprehensible and invisible; but what can be understood and seen, that is not God. And this can be said in another way: God is either visible or invisible. He is visible in His word and work; but where His word and work are not, there one should not want Him, for He cannot be found elsewhere than as He has revealed Himself. But they want to seize God with their speculation, and nothing comes of it; seize the wretched devil for it, who also wants to be God. 

But | admonish and warn everyone to let speculation stand, and do not flutter too high; but remain here with the manger and swaddling clothes in which Christ lies, "in whom dwelleth all fullness. 


134 


of the Godhead bodily", as Paul says Col. 2, 9. There one cannot miss God, but certainly meets and finds Him. | would like this rule to be observed after my death. 


Cap. 2. of God's works. 


In what God's consolation and man's consolation stand. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 158.) 


When the help of men ceases, the help of God comes to those who believe in Him. 


If we do not see any way, means, counsel, or manner by which we can be helped out of misfortune, then we conclude according to reason: It is over with us. But if we believe, our salvation is enhanced. For, as the Medici say, ubi desinit philosophia, ibi incipit medicina: Where philosophia ceases, there medicina begins. So we also say: Ubi desinit humanum auxilium, ibi divinum incipit, vel fides in verobum: Where human help ceases, there God's help begins, or faith in God's word. 


Our Lord God deals with Christians in a wonderful way. 


Affliction comes before salvation, and after salvation joy. To be oppressed and weighed down is to be built up and yet to grow and increase. Our Lord God makes his will against the Christian very colorful and curly, so that almost no one can send himself into it. God's kingdom dwells in the people who are baptized and believe in Christ from the heart, proving it also with their lives: and the true Christians are God's kingdom; but not the mouthed and colored Christians. And even though Christians are tormented and killed here, their Lord lives in heaven, and for this reason they must also live. 

The devil takes pleasure and is his work and greatest joy in suppressing God's work, in torturing and tormenting those who love God's word and hold fast to it; the others he leaves well alone. Because Christians are God's kingdom, they must also be tormented, martyred and oppressed. 


§ 157-163. 135 

A Christian must have evil days and suffer much; so our Adam, flesh and blood, will have good days and suffer nothing: how does this add up? Our flesh is given over to death and hell because it has followed the devil and has left God's commandment. Now if our flesh is to be redeemed from death and hell, and is to be again stripped and wrested from the devil, it must again keep God's commandment and join Him, which is no different than believing in Christ Jesus, that He is the Son of God and our Redeemer, and that we keep His word. The word of Christ is nothing else but bearing the cross, having love and hope in the cross, and believing that he will not leave us afflicted for eternity, and will save us and transfer us from this life to that eternal life; but having patience in love, and that one may give credit for his weakness to another, who also is in suffering and keeps it with Christ. 

Therefore, whoever claims to be a listener and disciple of God's word, and wants to be a Christian and be saved, does not have to wait for a good day here; but all his faith, hope and love is directed towards God and his neighbor. So his whole life is nothing else but suffering, cross and persecution, and all kinds of adversity and misfortune every hour, yes, every moment, must be expected. 


The works of God must be believed alone. 

The holy scripture says: "Do not inquire into high things", Rom. 12, 16; for all the works of God are inscrutable, no one can conceive them; only one must believe them, with reason no one can 1) understand them nor fathom them. 


162: Von GOttes unausforschlicher Majestat, aus D. M. Luther's Letter to M. Caspar Aquilam, parish priest at Salfeld. (This § is Walch, old edition, Vol. XXI, 1129 ff, No.'670, §§ 2-5.) 


One should not be afraid of God. (Contained in Cap. 2, § 45.)

136 


God's works are wonderful. (Lauterbach, Aug. 23, 1538, p. 118.) 


On August 23, a disputer asked: Where Balaam was from, if he lived in Syria at the water of Aram, as the text indicates? But how does the Scripture agree with this, which says that he was killed among the Midianites? [Luther] answered: Perhaps Balaam fled from Moses as a rebel (as they accused him), as if to say: Now the people will go to ruins; the rebellion is already beginning, and so he fled to the victorious Midianites. For Balaam saw the great plagues and confusion of the people of Israel, how God had afflicted them. Yes, God Himself also afflicted them, namely to harden the Gentiles, who always hoped for the downfall of Israel, as today the Papists rejoice in every confusion among us, and draw good hope from it. Thus, according to the judgment of all the Gentiles, the people of Israel were considered to be the most godless and rebellious sect, and | believe that Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, followed Moses and the Israelites in such great certainty that he thought that God stood for him and against Israel, as if the sea had opened for his sake; as if he wanted to say, as the text reads, "Now my soul will be satisfied" (Ex. 14:3). Now | have it for sure, that | shall seize it in the sea, and so he perishes in the greatest safety, and those in their weakness come away victorious. So God is strange in his regiment. That which is against him seems to be for him, and that which is for him seems to be against him. Sometimes he seems strong, sometimes weak, so that neither Satan nor all wisdom can judge him. Christ has often appeared very strong to the devil in miracles, but then also weak in suffering, and has even made the devil mad. Therefore, faith, not the wisdom of the flesh, belongs to the miraculous works of God. Thus Oecolampad is blinded by the argument: "Flesh is of no use" (Joh. 6, 63.). So the body of Christ is not there. And Zwingli: "He sits at the right hand of the Father" (Eph. 1, 20.). So he is not in the bread. These have been their brazen walls, on which they stood, and, ver 


Cap. 2. of God's works. § 164-166. 


137 


blinded by looking at everything through a colored glass, they have judged stiffly and firmly in their Opinion. 


God will wake up one day. 


It seems that our God is a sleepy, dumb, deaf and blind God, as the Psalter calls him in many places; but he will wake up one day and speak to his enemies in his wrath, Ps. 2, 5. Then beware, for it is written: | will awake from sleep, and rise, and smite mine enemies. This was said by Luther when Pace said that the Elector of Brandenburg had removed the chasuble from the Bishop of Strasbourg during mass and kissed the crucifix when it was placed in the grave. 


166. Bon God's punishment against the wicked, item, heretics and tyrants. 


D. Luther said in 1532 that when he was still in the monastery in Erfurt, he had once spoken to Doctor Staupitz: My dear Doctor, our Lord God deals so cruelly with people, who can serve Him when He lashes out like this? As we can still see in our adversaries, of whom he has punished and cleared away many terrible things, who in our time have rebelled against the teachings of the Gospel. To this Doctor Staupitz answered me at that time and said: "Dear, learn to look at God differently: if he did not do so, how could he otherwise dampen the hard heads? He must control the tall trees so that they do not grow into the sky. God strikes ad sanitatem, ut nos, qui alioqui opprimeremur, liberet et redimat. These examples taught me afterwards in 1530 at Coburg that | had rightly understood the appendix or addition to the ten commandments, since God says: "| am a zealous God, who punishes iniquity" 2c. Non est tam crudele in illos tyrannos supplicium, quam necessaria pro nobis Christianis defensio. Sic Zwinglium nunc periisse dicunt, cujus error si praevaluisset, periisse- mus nos cum Ecclesia nostra. But the fifth and fiftieth Psalm says v. 24: Viri sanguinum et dolosi non dimidiabunt dies suos."

1. the creation is briefly described by Moses. all obstacles. The earth bears and gives all kinds of grain, herbs, grain, barley 2c., wine, fruit, grass, herbs 2c. for the preservation and use of both man and beast. The trees bear all kinds of fruit, all animals give their use. 2) And who can tell it all? The devil likes to prevent all this, but God resists him. Therefore he is also called in the Scriptures the Lord of hosts, because he creates and sustains, that every creature may accomplish that for which he created and ordained it. Sometimes, however, God decrees that a time of unfruitfulness will come, that grain and all kinds of fruit will turn out badly, and that corruption will follow, as a punishment for the wicked, ungrateful world, which does not recognize that all kinds of fruit, vegetables and everything we enjoy are gifts from God. 


(Cordatus No. 1292. 1287.) 


High mysteries make vain error, therefore Moses wanted to describe the creation 1) only with few and very simple words, but the purchase of the cave in Hebron and the sacrifices and Jewish customs he described with very many words, so that they did not cause heresy. 

The story which so carefully describes the purchase of the cave by Abraham is described in such a way, so that it testified his faith in the promise given to him about the possession of the land of Canaan, and the unbelievers to a testimony also after the expulsion of his own from the holy land, because he knew that the devil would do something against his descendants; because he does not grant us a morsel of bread, and if we get it, he wants to take it from us

not let him go into abyssum, into the depth of the sea. For when the devils are cast out, they must not remain on earth, but they must go from the people into the sea. 

Count Volrat also said that once a sea miracle had been caught from a ship on the sea, which had been a woman. When it was kept on the ship, a ship's servant took her as his wife and fathered a child with her. After three years, when they returned by ship to the place where the sea miracle was first caught, the same woman jumped out of the ship and took the child with her, which had drowned, but she had disappeared before their eyes. Then the doctor said, "The devil can change in a woman's form, but also in a man's. 


7. question from the creation. 


One of them asked: How Moses could have written about the creation and other things, as at what times the archfathers, Adam, Seth, Enoch 2c. would have lived and died before and after the flood, if the creation had happened more than two thousand years before his time, and the archfathers had also fallen asleep long before? he answered: | think that many things were written before Moses. Adam will have briefly written and recorded the history of the creation, of his fall, of the promise of the woman's seed 2c., so the other fathers afterwards, especially Noah, what happened at each time. After that Moses will have taken it and put it in a proper order, taken from it and added to it what and how God commanded him; especially the history of the creation, item, of the seed that was to crush the serpent's head, he will have taken without any doubt from the teaching and preaching of the archfathers, which always one has inherited on the other. For | certainly believe that the preaching of the woman's seed, promised to Adam and Eve, for which they had a heartfelt longing and desire, was more powerful before the flood than the preaching of Christ at the last dangerous time. 


There will also have been heretics. If Cain had not fallen so horribly, had not become a murderer of his own brother, he would have seduced the greater part of the people and caused vain heresy; therefore God decreed that he should put Abel to death. This is also the end of all heretics, that they finally take up the sword and become murderers; as can be seen in the Arians and the Pabstics, and in our time in the Coiners, Anabaptists, Zwingel 2c. First, they begin their deeds with a pretense of godliness, color and adorn their lies with Scripture, thereby doing great harm, seducing many people, until finally, when their lies are exposed and punished, they put them to the sword. They are not always lacking in will, but only in opportunity; for Satan cannot hide in his limbs, he must let it be known that he is a liar and a murderer 2c. | think that Cain's death, especially among those who were related to him, caused a great cry and terror, so that they lamented: Behold, Lamech slew Cain our father. 


8. legends of the patriarchs before the flood, how they should be described and distinguished. 


A world would be given if it were possible to have the legends of the patriarchs who lived before the flood; there one would see how they lived, preached, and what they suffered. Our Lord God will have thought: | will keep their legends with the flood, for those who come after will not respect it, much less understand it: | will keep it until they come together again in that life. Then the dear arch-fathers after the flood, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, item, the prophets, apostles, their descendants and other holy people (whom the devil does not leave unchallenged in this life) will give them far preference and say: | lived a short time, to be counted against the time of the dear patriarchs before the flood, preached a few years and spread God's word, suffered my cross and tribulation over it. 


146 Cap. 3. of creation. §8-11. 147

Cap. 3. of the creation 


it 1) [Sodom] turned into a salt desert by its curse, not wanting the blessing. 


Children are God's special blessing and creature. 


When Jonah had hung a beautiful branch of cherries over the table in remembrance of creation, and praised the glorious blessing of God in such fruits, D. M. Luther said: "Why do you not consider this more in your children than in your body's fruits, which surpass and are more beautiful and also more glorious creatures of God than all trees? M. Luther: "Why do you not consider this more in your children than in the fruits of your body, which surpass and are more beautiful and also more glorious creatures of God than the fruits of all trees? In them Mn sees God's omnipotence, wisdom and art, who has made them from nothing: has given them in one year body, life and all limbs so fine, fine and beautiful, and wants to nourish and sustain them. Nevertheless, we do not pay much attention to it, and may even become blind and stingy over such gifts from God; as commonly happens that people, when they have children, become more angry and stingy, scrape, scrape and scrape as much as they can, so that they may leave them much. They do not know that even before a child comes into the world and is born, its modest share, what and how much it will have and what it will become, is allotted and provided for it; as the Scriptures say and the common saying is: The more children, the more happiness. Oh, dear Lord God, how great is the blindness, ignorance and wickedness of a man who cannot realize this, but does the opposite in the very best and most glorious gifts of God: which he misuses for all sins and disgraces, according to all his pleasures and pleasures, and does not sing a Deo gratias to our Lord God for it.

The words from "similar" to "are" are to be taken as parentheses. KalsuZinem also fits Sodom, indeed better than Samaria and Judea. Cf. G. Jauss: Beschreibung des heiligen Landes, p. 26. 

2) So Stangwald instead of "sing". 


-§ 1-14. 14A 


13. a different. 


3) Luther was astonished beyond measure when he saw that the trees were so beautiful and full of fruit, and said: "If Adam had not fallen, we would have looked at all creatures in this way: every tree and stalk would have been better and more noble than if it had been gold or silver. For after the manner of things, if it be rightly considered, every green tree is much more glorious than if it were a tree of gold or silver. 

(Here 25 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 7, §6.) 


14. another one from the abuse of god creatures. (Cordatus No. 1761. 1762. 1763.) 


The constant recurrence makes things small, strange things are respected. 

Avarice and ambition make that we have no pleasure in things. 

The wicked do not see the glory of God, yes, even the present creature they cannot recognize, because since God constantly showers the wicked and all people with the greatness and quantity of His creatures, so that by His goodness He attracts to Himself those who are lost by nature, they, on the other hand, only become worse through such great goodness and constant perseverance. What can God do about it, because to hell? If one were to bring an egg from Kalekut and a hen, we would be astonished to death and see. Therefore belongs [Matth. 6, 26. 28.]: "Look at the birds and the lilies of the field." A fish in the water beats with its tail, namely the male, and casts forth seed; there is the female with it, and receives at once a hundred thousand fish, and all philosophers cannot give the reason of such things, which Moses alone [Gen. 1, 3. ff.] put forward, "He said, and it came to pass," [Gen. 1, 28.], "Grow and multiply." So it goes on. 


3) This § probably spurious, formed as entrance to the section omitted here, which was spoken on Christmas Day 1538. On this day there were probably golden and silver fruits on the trees, by which these thoughts of Aurifaber are caused.

15. bom swath D. Martini Luther's thoughts. (Cordatus No. 1398. 1399.) 

| am convinced that Schwaden Manna is heavenly bread. It is so disgusting [i.e. delicate] that if you nibble it with one finger, it spoils. 

Swaths are collected early in a sieve and it falls from heaven, does not grow on earth. Prudentius calls it thawing bread, and all physicians call it manna, as it is called in the text [Ex. 16, 13. 14? One shakes the shoots [Reusze], so it falls off, and cooks it, as one wants, like the Coriander [is] and white like the Thau. They call it what is prepared, as if one said: | find you there, you are right for me. It is spoiled by the mere touching of it and by the noonday sun, that is, the word of God does not suffer any addition. 


16. of fruits and fruit. 


When Martinus had a turnip full of juice in his hand and ate from it, he said: "The dear fathers must have been healthy people, who lived and ate from the fruits and roots that grew from the earth, and had food and drink from them. | believe that Adam would not have wished him a partridge; but at fruits and at fruit he has had more pleasure, have tasted him much better, than everything roasted and boiled. When | read that the holy fathers lived on roots, | thought they ate the roots of trees. 

(From here to the end of the § in Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, 

p. 79.) 

The greatness and diversity of God's gifts overwhelms us, and through the frequency everything becomes small; even the greatest is considered nothing, the very small is valued. It happens to our Lord God, as it happens to parents, whose children consider the daily food to be of no value, but apples, pears, and nuts are held in high esteem. 


17. fruit respect the children more than money. 


1) Anno 36 the 6th of September the doctor's little children stood before the table, watched with 1) Similar to Cordatus No. 662 in the first paragraph. - When 


| asked my son what he would give me for food for a year, he said 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 15-17. 


151 


When the doctor saw this, he said, "Whoever wants to see a picture of someone who rejoices in hope, has here quite a conterfei. Oh, that we could look upon the last day so joyfully in hope! Then he said about the power of peaches, that it was such a delicious fruit, close to the juice of wine. There are large grapes in Persia and Welsh, there must be also large peaches, that these are in our countries like the sloes against it. 

Who can rightly recognize the nature, kind and power of the creatures? Adam and Eve will have had such fruit, yes, much better; ours are mere wooden apples compared to it, as all creatures 2) are compared to it. What do you think of the serpent, which will have jested with Eve as the most beautiful creature? It was eaten out of the womb in the most friendly way; for the scripture says in Genesis 3:1 that "the serpent was more cunning than all the other animals on earth"; therefore it will have been the most friendly and the most blissful before others; as still today its little crown and three-edged tongues indicate. But after the curse she has lost her feet and her beautiful body, and must crawl and eat earth. 

At the same time, the serpent was the most beautiful animal to Adam above all others, by which the devil was supposed to decorate his art, as he likes to decorate himself at all times; for what is to tempt to sin must be beautiful. A bad, simple farmer and an unlearned man, or an ugly maid, water or a rude sack will not provoke and move anyone to heresy, avarice, fornication, drunkenness or court, but rather a fine, smooth tongue, roses, 3) florins and good thalers, beautiful matzos and sweet wine, beautiful velvet 2c. Thus Satan tempts and induces a man to sin by the purest and most beautiful creatures. 


replied the child, "Father, you do not buy food and drink; only apples and pears cost a lot of money. Thus men despise the daily gifts of God; but which are really small, they esteem highly 2c. 

2) After "creatures" we have omitted the words "and animals" with Stangwald. The meaning should be: all creatures are now bad and low compared to what they were in paradise. 

3) So Stangwald instead of "rothe Nobel". 


152 


Oh, the quare, Why? was a horrible affect and thought in paradise; how sorry | am for Aphkija! which is a little word that only admonishes and drives. As soon as the serpent turned to Eve in a friendly manner and said: "Do you mean, how? yes? So that she indicated both with thoughts, words and gestures the highest desire and desire for it. As if the devil should say through the serpent and sneer, "You must indeed be great fools to believe," as if God should have thus forbidden you: "For God is not such a man as to ask so precisely whether you eat or not. For since it is a tree of knowledge of good and evil, how can God be so envious that He would not have you be wise and prudent? Aphkiah caused the misfortune that Adam and Eve, who before had the most beautiful and pure bodies, senses, understanding and will, without all evil desire, now became even deceived and the devil's larvae. Their eyes were able to see clearly for many miles, their ears could hear and hear softly; now our eyes have the star. At that time Adam went to his wife without all evil desire, lust and heat, and Eve soon conceived and gave birth without any pain, but now everything has been disguised and reversed. 

Rather, look at the young children, whose bodies are still purer and cleaner, than those who still have something, although very little, of Adam's first kind. Eyes, ears and all limbs are more beautiful; dung does not stink so much from them as from the old, so that in youth all limbs are purer and stronger. 

In this misery of ours, this is our comfort, that there is another, better and eternal life left. The greatest number die before they come to their senses; many die without children, that they become neither father nor mother: therefore our Lord God must have something great in mind, that it will be much different, namely the resurrection of the dead, since we believe that there will be a new heaven and a new earth, and we will live forever. Which is an abominable, difficult, even impossible article for reason to believe, as all other works of God are against reason. Reason are. Aristotle, the learned 


Cap. 3. of the creation. 


§17. 18. 153 Heide, since he writes about the nature of animals, can speak nothing of it. 

Summa, God is incomprehensible in creatures, but he can be felt and touched in his word, although he does not do it as we would like, because he does not hold our geometry, measurement and arithmetic. In the face of man he has set the house of fire, the cloaca, in the midst. If | had been a master builder or his counselor, | would have made only one eye on the forehead, one ear on the side, and the nose on the other side. But God has done it differently, he can make the most beautiful bodies out of dust and dirt, and puts the most beautiful eyes in all animals. 


18. a different. (Lauterbach, Nov. 15, 1538, p. 167.) 


He then admired the loveliness and the fruit of the deer park at Lochau, where the deer stood, jumped around and watched the people, [and said:] There our Lord God also made his kitchen to preserve the courts of the princes. After that, in the evening, Luther saw a little bird sitting on the top of a tree to spend the night. He said: The bird already has its dinner and will stay here for the night, unconcerned about the morrow and about its home, rather, as David says (Ps. 91, 1.), it will sit "Under the umbrella of the Most High". He sits contentedly on his little branch, letting God take care. 

Oh, if Adam's fall had not spoiled everything, how glorious and divine a creature man would have been, how filled with great knowledge and wisdom he would have lived blissfully, free of all misfortune, and then he would have laid aside his earthly body by being transformed, without all the tastes of death. All creatures would have been very pleasant to him, in all things there would have been the sweetest change, as [God] even now in this very miserable life has pictured the resurrection of the dead in many creatures. When they were lost in the park and he saw knots tied in the trees, he said: "This is what the knot is for, that you may know which is the right way. 


154 Cap. 3. of creation. § 19-23. 155 


19. several questions. (Lauterbach, Nov. 20, 1538, p. 175.) 


After that he tasted his wines for the wedding. 1) One should, he said, give the guests a good drink, that they may be merry. For, as the Scripture says (Ps. 104:15), "Bread comforts the heart of man, but wine gladdens it." 

After that, he asked the Englishman how wine could be brought into the cellar and should neither be crushed nor poured, and he answered: "You should crush must into it and then it will become wine. It is a physical, natural magic. Then he asked, "What are the most extensive waters in all regions? Namely snow, rain and dew. The water goes over the whole land, without borders, even in the mountains. For the highest mountains are covered with eternal snow, because they are in the middle region of the air, which is uninhabitable. Only the devil can dwell there, because he is the lord of the world, as Paul (Eph. 6, 12.) calls him. 


20. spill wine or salt. 


D. Mart. broke a very bright glass, full of wine on the table; then he said: This is gone, it is a weak vessel. He said, "It is a great superstition and superstition in the world that people would rather see wine spilled than salt. But it can still be helped, so that itis still acceptable: if you spill the wine or take it away, you can still live without it; but if you want to spill the bread and salt and take it away from the people, then it will take effort and work, then you will begin to see sour, then it will become bad at first. 


21. children are God's blessing. 


He had a rose in his hand, marveled greatly at it, as at a beautifully excellent work and creature of God, and said: 


1) For this wedding Luther requested some game in the letter to John, Prince of Anhalt, on Nov. 22, 1538. - The bride and groom were: LInA. Ambrosius Berndt and Luther's sister daughter, Magdalena Kaufmann (Bkuhme Lene in Luther's letter to his son Johannes, June 19, 1530). - Cf. cap. 43, § 34 and § 35. 


If a man were able to make a few roses, he should be given an empire. But one does not pay attention to the innumerable many gifts of God: because they are common and we deal with them daily, one does not ask much about them, thinking that it must be so, that it naturally happens by chance. 

We see that God gives children to almost all people, fruits of the body, like parents: a farmer shall have three, four or more sons, like him, as if they were cut out of his eyes. All this is not respected, because it is common and happens for and for that reason. It is not a small thing, even among the pagans, that children are born looking and resembling their parents. As Virgilius the poet (Aeneid. 4.) wrote of the queen Dido that she wished she could beget a little Aeneas from Aenea, who would resemble him, look like the father, run around and play. And the Greeks, when they cursed, wished that one's children should not resemble him. 


22. from the children's birth. (Cordatus No. 704.) 


Giving birth to a woman is very difficult, because the fruit has to go out through the bones, because the bones of the womb have to push each other with force, through which (as it seems) hardly an apple could come out. This is a great and immeasurable miracle of God. 


God's creation of a human being is a miraculous work. 


(This § follows § 28 of this Cap. "Lauterbach p. 87], Kummer p. 378.) 

Who can consider the size of the sun, which is far greater than the earth? If one looks at it early in the morning, it looks like a brewing vat, but it can rise in one hour no more than ten spans high and yet it runs in the fastest way in twelve hours from the beginning to the end, and if two hundred suns were lined up ina circle of animals like a paternoster, they would reach from the east to the west; therefore the size of the sun is inexpressible. Likewise, who would have called God 


156 


Has he ever given this advice, that he should join a man and a woman together? Then he gives a woman to the man, who has two breasts, and little warmth on them. Some drop of male seed is the origin of sucha large human body, from which flesh, blood, legs, skin, hair 2c. is made, as Job says Cap. 10, 10: "Have you (God) not milked me like milk and curdled me like cheese? So God is very foolish in all his works. If | had advised him, | would have kept the creation of man in the earthen vessel, and set a great lamp in the midst of the earth for the sun, so that it would always have been day. 


24. from twins, (Lauterbach, Dec. 1, 1538, p. 184.) 


In the first of December it was written of Nuremberg how a woman there had given birth to four little children at once, two sons and two little daughters, and all of them remained alive. Luther said: "Giving birth is God's work, much more is this miraculous. But the monk children, those undeveloped lumps, do the greatest harm to women; for other fetuses help themselves, but those lumps are a very burdensome burden to the mother. 


God's creation in creatures is wonderful. 


The birth is very fine and well ordered by God in all creatures, as in man and woman: for no one can conceive the work of birth, nor consider how the fruit comes out in birth and grows in half a day; it stretches so that one notices it. And if one wanted to bring a chicken, which has crawled out of the shell this hour, back into the shell, it would be impossible. 

Item, in marriage we all learn and experience that childbearing and childbearing is not in our power and arbitrariness, because the parents cannot see beforehand nor know whether they are fertile, nor whether they will have a son or a daughter. All this is done without our forethought or foreknowledge. My father and mother did not think that they should bring a doctor. 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 23-27. 


137 


It is only God's creature, which we cannot think out or understand right now. | believe that in this life and in the life to come we will have nothing more to do but ponder and wonder about the Creator and the creatures. The pagan philosophers and all scholars cannot judge any further than that birth has its equal, and one animal begets and sustains another that is like it. Moses, however, explains and says who is the original cause and founder or master, how, why, and for what purpose all things were created. 


26. from the comet. (Cordatus No. 911.) 


A comet is also a wandering star [pla- netaris] and wanders around, is a hur-child among other stars and a proud star, occupies the whole sky, acts as [if] it were there alone, has the kind of heretics who also want to be considered alone for men on earth. 


27. from the sun. 


D. M. Luther said that he had noticed and respected that the sun had now gone out for two days with joy and leaping, as the 19th Psalm, v. 6. 7. says: "It rejoices, like a hero, to run the way. She ariseth at one end of heaven, and runneth again to the same end, and nothing is hid from her heat." It is a beautiful work of God, which we nevertheless cannot look at, nor cling to with our eyes, but must turn our backs on it. 

Oh, dear Lord God, if we had remained in paradise, we would have been able to look at the sun with bright eyes, without all hindrance and pain; but through Adam's fall, everything is ruined. Adam's fall is a horrible thing, which the world neither considers nor respects. We see people die every day, one after the other, and no one is sure of his life for a moment, and many a misfortune comes one after the other; nevertheless, we do not respect it, do not think that it will also come to us. Thus, God's wrath is held in low esteem, because it happens daily. 


158 


we get used to it and put it to the wind. If we had remained in paradise, we would not have needed either death or forgiveness of sins; we would not have died, but would have been transformed from this temporal life into eternal life, without all pain; we would have seen and praised only the unspeakable goodness and mercy of God. 


28. a different. 


(This § [Lauterbach p. 87.], in Kummer p. 378, immediately follows the first paragraph of Cap. 2, §104.) 

The earthly works of the creation we cannot recognize completely, as we admit with the celestial bodies and things situated above us. Who could ever have advised God at the time of creation that he should burden the exceedingly great light of the sun with such a very rapid course that in every hour it covers in its uninterrupted course many hundreds of thousands of miles in the great circumference of the circle of animals? Consider the size of the earth, how great a distance it is on the earth from India to Spain, and yet it [the earth] is only the center of the circle and of the course of the sun, which travels through the outermost circles with unspeakable speed in its rapid, untiring course, as we see in a wagon wheel, whose axis turns slowly, but the outermost parts move very quickly. 1) 


29. question. 

If it was light before the sun, it follows that the sun does not make light. D. Martinus answered: "The light of the sun, before it was created, did not exist together as it is now, but was scattered, but God brought the same light together in one lump and made one light out of it, namely the sun as we see it now. 


30. what kind of man Adam was. (Cordatus No. 1030.) 


Adam was a very simple man. | do not believe that he burned lights, and 


1) This is followed by § 23 of this chapter. 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 27-32. 


159 


[I believe that he did not know that a cow had unsilit furs in its body, nor that he had slaughtered cattle. | wonder where he took the furs. But there is no doubt that he had a very beautiful body and that he saw the eighth grandson. Noah was very wise because he was afflicted by many trials. 


31. Adam's moderation. (Cordatus No. 1095.) 


If Adam now returned and saw our expenditure of clothing, food, drink 2c., he would say he had never been in this world, for he drank water, ate the fruit of the trees, and put on a fur of skins. Our ancestors also lived very frugally, and Boaz says [Ruth 2, 14.] "Dip your bread in vinegar," likewise [Richt. 19, 5.j: "Savour thy heart beforehand with a morsel of bread.” For they were populous regions, therefore the multitude of the people caused them to be thrifty. 


32. question. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 240.) 


Because God knew that man would not remain in his original innocence, in which He had created him, why did He create man? To this question Paul answers: A great Lord must also have shit tiles in his house (Rom. 9, 21.). But if he uses some of his dishes in honor, he thereby increases the prestige of his house and praises his goodness. 

2) There are many of them who think, when they have heard or read a sermon or two, that they can now do it all, that they have even eaten the Holy Spirit with feathers; which are satanic, fretful spirits: just as if one could learn the high, great secret of divine majesty, the heavenly golden art of God's counsel, since it is far lacking in common worldly arts and no one can fully study it. How then should one learn in such a depraved, miserable, weak 


2) Similar thoughts Cap. 7, p 110 at the end: likewise Cap. 12, § 19. 


160 


How can we investigate and thoroughly comprehend the nature and blindness of the high divine Majesty's counsel and heart? 

(From here to the end of § Cordatus No. 241.) 

There are people who, after hearing God's word, would rather they had not learned as much as they have learned, because the servant who knows God's will and does not do it will receive more strokes [Luc. 12, 47. 1. These do not know Paul's saying [Rom. 2, 1.]: "Therefore, O man, you cannot excuse yourself, even if you did not know it." 


A man does not understand God's creature and work. 


We do not know how our Lord God arranges His building, we only see the framework of poles and crafted ropes; therefore, we do not respect God's will, but we ignore it and do not ask much about it. But when we see God's building and house in that life, we will be amazed and rejoice that we have endured trials. 


(Here 5 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 61, § 9.) 


34, why we live in houses. 


We were created under heaven, but the reason we live in houses is because Adam fell, and because of sins; just as a sick person has jars of medicine from the pharmacy and needs plasters: that is, we must have chambers, rooms, houses, clothes, food and drink, beds and camps. Before Adam fell, we would have been like young journeymen jumping about naked and bare: there would have been no need of carpenters, masons, tailors, shoemakers, or houses. 


35. arable farming. 

To build the field is a divine work that God commanded, as in Genesis 1:28: "Build the earth and subdue it"; even if it bears thistles and thorns, don't mind it, your part shall still grow. 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 32-38. 


161 


36. adam's apple bite. (Cordatus No, 938.) 


The bite of Adam into the apple was a heavy bite, of which also we can say [Ezk. 18, 2.]: "The fathers have eaten herbs, but the teeth of the children have become dull from it. That's why the Claus fool probably said: "The misfortune pours my mouth, that it has been so naschig. 


(37) Speech separates a man from all animals. 


Of all the gifts of God, speech is the most beautiful and glorious, and by it alone man is distinguished from all other animals. Otherwise there are some animals that surpass man in other gifts: some with sight, some with hearing, some with smell, but none can speak. Although this is an indication that the word must be of a high kind and understanding. 


38. Adam's misery on earth. 


Adam, the father of us all, will have been the most miserable and afflicted man. 1) It must have been mighty lonely for him to see everything desolate in such a wide world. But when he gave birth to Cain, their first son, with his Eve, who was his only companion and dear spouse, there will have been great joy; likewise when Abel was born. But soon after that great tribulation, sorrow and heartache followed, when one brother slew another, and Adam lost one son, and had to put the other under ban and under guard, and cast him out of his sight. This must truly have been a great heartache to him, so that such a murder must have hurt him and grieved him more than his own fall, because through it he once again became a hermit with his dear Eve. After that, when he was a hundred and thirty years old, he begat Seth. That was hard and it hurt to see God's wrath for such a long time. Alas, he has been a sorrowful man, so that no one believes that he will experience it, although our suffering is child's play compared to his suffering and heartache. And if he were not so pious 


1) Cf. A 45 of this chapter. 


162 


and strong nature by God's grace and effect, he and his Eve would soon have passed away and died of great heartache, but with the promise of faith in the woman's seed he was comforted. 


39. weakness and misery of human nature. 


D. Martin marveled and complained about the weakness, misery and wretchedness with which this poor flesh is weighed down and burdened, from which so much filth, dung, snot and sweat comes. If there were nothing but filth in all parts, and if the soul were not more beautiful than the body, a man would be a poor, miserable creature. Therefore the Greeks rightly say, est quasi ora, id est, sepulchrum: man's body is like a corpse. 

40. of the regiment of the maggot sack of human body. (Kuinmer x. 361 d. [Lauterbach, July 20, 1538, p. 99, note)) After the dysentery he was very troubled with 

hardness (rélvagudc) and spoke: | must 

let the Ars have his regiment, because God has his punishment also on these members. As we read in 1 Sam. 5, (v. 6.) of the plague of the Philistines when they had taken the ark of God. | mean, they were really afflicted in the butt, that they had to make for a guilt offering to our Lord God five golden eels and five golden mice. Thus God is mighty in all creatures, killing and making alive. For actually our sleep is a death, and death is a sleep. What is our death but a night sleep? 1) For just as through sleep all weakness disappears and the spiritual powers return, so that one looks fresh-minded in the morning, so on Judgment Day we will rise as if we had slept only one night, will be fresh and strong, and will only wipe our eyes. Then the worms, maggots and stink will fall away. Dear God, how wonderful you are in the formation of the limbs of the human body; how frail and exceedingly delicate they are, since they were first formed from a trope. 


1) Cf. Gen. 49, 33; Walch, St. Louis Edition Vol. Il, 2070, § 445. 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 38-43. 


163 


The heart is the best part of a human being and its most essential part. The heart, the best part of a human being and its most essential part, is the most delicate. One still rushes to it as if it were a wall, three cubits thick. How we live so completely in the midst of death! Therefore it is a very heavy lament in Job (Cap. 14, 1.), in which he describes man: "Man, born of woman, lives a short time, and is full of restlessness." 


41.a different. (Lauterbach, Aug. 3, 1538, p. 106.) 


This year is a terrible, dangerous year, quite a spiteful year, bringing many very serious illnesses; perhaps naturally because of the comets and the conjunction of Saturn and Mars; but spiritually because of the endless sins of men. Well, it is nothing with this life; we do not want to attribute anything to it and believe in God, who gives eternal life. Give us one blessed hour, and we will have been here. 


42. question. 


Why do men not so easily accept the doctrine and knowledge of outward respectability and discipline, which are naturally planted and written in the heart of all, such as: Honor thy parents; as those which stand alone in the mind, namely, that twice four are eighth? Answer: The fault is that our nature is completely corrupted and insane through original sin; our understanding and knowledge are so darkened that we do not see and recognize properly, much less do what is naturally innate in us. 


43. difference of the animals. (Cordatus No. 1055.) 


All wild animals live under the law, for they fear men and are afraid at the sight of them, and men are like dogs to wild animals. But the tamed animals, which have white flesh, are animals of grace, live with men and are apes of them. But man without doctrine is neither a wild beast under the law, nor a beast under grace. 


164 


What a being and sense would have been in paradise. 


There were [on February 26, 1538] 1) at D. Martin's M. Spalatinus and the pastor of Zwickau, M. Leonhard Beier. Leonhard Beier were at the table: there the doctor joked nicely with his son Martinichen, who wanted to defend his family honestly, dress them honestly and love them; he said: So we would have been in paradise, bad, simple, sincere, without all malice and hypocrisy, and would have been right serious, as this child speaks of God, and is certain of it. 

That is why such natural jokes and jests are the very best for children, they are the sweetest little fools. Assumed jokes and jesting at the old do not have such grace, do not plead and do not please so well: because what is colored and composed, that denies favor, does not stick and makes less air than that which comes naturally from the heart. That is why the little children are the finest play birds, who speak and do everything simply, from the heart and naturally. Claus Narr was such a one, who hoarded in his boots, and when he was accused, he apologized [to the councilor Pfeffinger] 2) and said: The mice had done it. 


45. adam's case. 


D. Martin said about the miserable and sad case of Adam, that he had fallen from the state of innocence into misery and unhappiness with all his descendants, as we see and experience: Oh, he has, he said, led a miserable miserable life for the nine hundred years, for in all dying men he has seen God's wrath. 


46. question. (Contained in Cap. 3, § 7, at the beginning.) 


47 Adam's heartache after the fall. 


Adam will have had a great unspeakable heartache and sorrow, after he had lost the righteousness in which he was created by God. 


1) Thus the Hall manuscript. Bindseil |, 249. 2) Hall manuscript. Bindseil I, 250.

He must also have lost a lot of weight in his body because of great worry and fear in his heart. | believe that before, he would have been able to see over a thousand miles as far and as brightly as we can see half a mile now, and thus with the other senses as well. He will no doubt have said after the fall: Oh God, what has happened to me? | have become blind and deaf: where have | been? | have no doubt that this is what happened to him, and it happened that way. It is a terrible case. Before, he saw that all creatures were obedient to him, that he had also played with the snake. Our eyes and ears are almost dead, we do not see and hear well. We will not eat ham there, we must become more beautiful again than Adam was; but childbearing and childbearing will cease. 


48 On the miserable state of human life. 


Doctor Martin Luther said in Eisleben in 1546: "Oh, how poor we are, we earn our living by sinning. For when we reach the seventh year, we do nothing but eat, drink, play and sleep: from the eighth year we go to school for about three or four hours a day. After that, from that time until the twenty-first year, we do all kinds of hard work, playing, running, going to the bar, and so on, and then we start to do some work. When we reach the age of fifty, we have worked hard and become children again, eat our bread with sins, and work so that we can give other people work to do. When we reach the age of twenty, we first begin to work, and work for ten years, after which we sleep the rest of the time. Half of our lives we sleep, so that hardly five years remain for work, or even three years. Vix decimam partem nostrae vitae we work: the ninth part of our life we eat, drink, sleep and walk idly. Fie on us, we do not give God the decimas. Ah! what do we want with our good works to please God? 


166 


How can we earn our money or be proud of our good works? Job says Cap. 9, 2. 3.: Si Deus volet contendere mecum, non potero eéi respondere. What have | done here today? | crapped for two hours, ate for three hours and then walked idly for four hours. Alas! Domine, ne intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Ps. 143, 2. 


49. of the short life of people. 


(This § is contained in the report of D. Just. Jonas and Mag. Célius on Luther's demise. Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 283-, 4 10.) 


50. human life a poor life. (Cordatus No. 509.) 

It is a very miserable life when someone is plagued by his dearest friends, like David by Absalon, Job by his wife 2c. Thus, the lovers are the most miserable martyrs that the devil leads on the fool's rope. In short, human life is a nonsense. For as long as we are children, we are plagued by childish infirmities; as youths, we are mad with love affairs, and after that, other and other infirmities break in, until, having become men, we become servants of mammon, servants of money. 


51.a different. (Cordatus No. 858.) 

We eat ourselves to death, drink ourselves to death, sleep ourselves to death, grasp ourselves to death, shit ourselves to death. This is what we are now experiencing with dysentery. Therefore, how good a reason do we have to be proud? 


52. a different one from human misery. (Contained in Cap. 48, § 38.) 


53. of the human skin under the eyes. (Cordatus No. 847.) There is no more delicate skin on people than under the eyes, and yet none suffers more. 


54. of children and the same life. (Lauterbach, Aug. 17, 1538, p. 114.) On August 17, he heard the quarreling and bickering of his children, and when soon after he perceived 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 48-56. 


167 


hen they were reconciled again, he said: "Dear Lord od, how pleasing to you are the life and play of such hildren! Yes, all their sins are nothing but forgiveness f sins. 


55. a different. 


He saw the simplicity of his children, and praised heir innocence, that they were much more learned in aith than we old fools, for they believed most simple- 

indedly, without all disputation and doubt, that God as merciful, and that after this life there was eternal ife. How good it is for the children who die in such a ime! Although it would be a great sorrow to my heart, ecause a piece of my body and a part of my mother's ody would die, which natural love and affections do ot cease even in godly and righteous Christians, so hat they would not accept it or let themselves be 

oved, or would not go to their hearts, if it were to appen to them, their children or their mother. 


The people of the world are not evil to the relatives hom they love, like the stubborn and hardened eads and sticks. For such movements and nclinations are works of divine creation, which God as naturally implanted in a human being, and are not vil in themselves. The children live finely simple, ure, without offence and hindrance of reason in faith; s Ambrose says: "There is a lack of reason, but not f faith. 


56. We must become like children before our Lord God. (Lauterbach, Sept. 30, 1538. p. 137.) 


Last September he saw his little children sitting at he table and said: Christ says Matth. 18, 3: "Unless ou turn around and become like children, you will not nter the kingdom of heaven". Where did you ommand that a wise man should follow foolish hildren? How can our Lord God stand with His udgment and righteousness, which Paul so praises: 

od's righteousness, God's righteousness? Is this ighteousness, that thou shouldest reject the prudent nd accept the foolish? It is said here: Faith 


168 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 56-63. 


169 


God's words. Give in, our Lord God has purer thought 


than we have. He must therefore deburr us (as th gushers speak). He must cut away the coars branches and chips from us before he makes suc children and fools out of us. 

Behold, how fine pure thoughts the children have how they look at heaven and death without any doubt They are in paradise, as it were, and the children wh become heroes always have wonderful gifts. 


57. another one of little children. (Cordatus No. 639.) 

My son, Johannes Luther, sat at the table and onc said seriously that the highest joy in heaven is i Estonia, dancing 2c. There is a river flowing with milk and the bread rolls grow by themselves. This life of th children is the very happiest, because it has no worldl worries, does not see the strange happenings in th church, nor suffers the horrors of death or futur infirmities, but the children have only good thoughts. 


58. a different. (Cordatus No. 399 and No. 1542.) 

The children have such fine thoughts about God that he is in heaven, that he is their God; and as h held his little son Martin in his arms, he added: "! wis that | had died in this child's age, and | wanted to giv it all the honor and good that | have and may com over in the world. 

When he had taken the child to himself and i defiled him, he said: Oh, our Lord God must suffe much greater stench from men than father and mothe from their children. 


59. a different from children. 

He, Doctor Martin, was watching how his little chil of three years was playing and slurring with himself then he said, "This child is like a drunkard, does no know that it is alive, lives along quite safely an happily, jumps and leaps. And such children like to b in large wide rooms and dwellings, where they hav space. 


60: Parents’ songs against their children. (Cordatus No. 948. 949.) 


It is a wonderful grace that the youngest children are always the dearest to parents. My youngest child is my greatest treasure. And this affection for them is necessary because they need the greatest care. Those who have begun to speak can already take care of themselves in some way. The little children mainly need our care. From this can be understood the heart throbbing of Abraham when he went to kill his only son 2c. He will not have told Sarah about it. | would truly dispute with God if he would present such a thing to me. 

According to the judgment of reason, God was more fatherly toward Caiphas, Pilate 2c., than toward His only Son, whom He had so miserably murdered. 


61. Cain Adam's favorite child. (Cordatus No. 1255.) 

Dear God, how will Adam have loved Cain so much, namely his son born to him first, and this one, thanking the father for it, became a murderer. Fie on you! 


62. a different. 


Grandparents love their children's children and nephews much more than their own children produced by their bodies. But the chickens, dogs and other unreasonable animals soon forget their young. And such love is an indication of immortality, because they have a hope of future resurrection and eternal life. 


The parents’ and the authorities’ power is different. (Cordatus No. 1038. 1039.) 

Parents guard and restrain their children with greater care than the authorities do their subjects. That is why Moses says, "Have | begotten you?" For the parents have a natural, self-originated dominion over the children, a self-grown dominion, but those [the authorities] have a drawn and forced, a made dominion. 


170 Cap. 3. of creation. § 63-67. 171 


Where father and mother can no longer, the executioner must execute and avenge. And the authorities are the guardians of the fourth commandment, like the cat over the mice. Therefore, their dignity is greater, but the reverence for parents must be greater, because they are the source and origin of the fourth commandment. 


The children's discipline and punishment is necessary. 


Martin Luther did not want to accept his son John again for three days, although he had humbly asked in writing and his mother, D. Jonas, D. Cruciger and Philippus interceded for him, 1) and said: | would rather have a dead son than a naughty son. St. Paul did not say in vain in 1 Tim. 3:4 that "a bishop should be such a man as presides well over his household and has well-bred children," so that other people, being edified by it, may take a good example and not be offended. We preachers are therefore set so high that we should give others a good example, but our ill-bred children offend others, so the boys want to sin on our privileges. Yes, even if they often sin and do all kinds of mischief, | do not find out about it; they do not show it to me, but keep it secret from me. And let us follow the common saying: What evil happens in our own houses, we learn at the very last; when all the people have carried it through all the streets, then we learn it only. Therefore we must punish him and not look through his fingers, nor let him go unpunished. 


65. question. 


Whether a son, if he knew that his father wanted to betray a city or country, or do great harm and wrong to another, should report it to the authorities? Answer D. Mart: The son is not obligated to be obedient to the father, to do something against God and to sin. However, he may remind and admonish the father to desist from it and not to do it, if not, he would do it. 


1) The improvement in the beginning of this § is according to the Hall manuscript. Bindseil I, 253, 


He must report it to the authorities, because otherwise he would silently consent to his father's actions and would share in them, even at his own risk. As if | saw that my father wanted to kill and murder someone, | should lie down between them and defend myself. 

But how, if either the son had to kill the father or have the fatherland betrayed, how should he behave here? Answer: The son should by no means kill the father in any way, but rather command the fatherland to our Lord God and let him rule, who can well preserve and protect the fatherland. For if | were to kill my father, | would not be able to desecrate the fatherland. Why should | then kill and murder the certain father for the sake of the uncertain salvation of the fatherland? We must command our Lord God and dare to do it. 


66. the custom of the goods is the most important. 


Since M. Philipp Melanchthon said that a rich citizen of Leipzig, Simon Leubel, had sold a large, beautiful, funny, well-built house 2), D. Martinus answered: It is not a matter of making the heirs rich, but it is most important that the heirs can send themselves into it and use God's blessing properly. And we parents are great fools, that we let it become blood sour to us, work day and night, that we leave much good to our children; but to train and instruct them in the fear of God, good discipline and respectability, there we are very negligent. It is a wicked, wrong way. 


The children shall suffer the infirmities of their parents. 


When M. Antonius Lauterbach's father-in-law came to the doctor, he asked the son-in-law in particular how he got along with his father-in-law and what kind of agreement they had. And he seriously admonished him that he wanted to hold him in honor as a father,

73, another: No father shall hand over his good to his children at his life. 

One 1) was with D. Martino and complained of his misery, that he was abandoned and _ trampled underfoot by his children, whom he had endowed and honestly gifted, indeed, had turned all his goods over to them; then the doctor said: Jesus Sirach gives the best advice to parents, since he says: Do not give everything out of your hand, because you live, because the children do not keep faith. A father (as the saying goes) can feed ten children, but ten children cannot feed a father. 2) That is why in the old days people preached against ungrateful children, about a father who had made his will, which he secretly locked in a box, and put a note with it together with a club, with these words: Whichever father gives his own out of his power shall soon be beaten to death with a club. 

Thus it was said of a father who had divided all his goods among his children, that they should feed and maintain him with them all his life; but the children paid no attention to him. When he had been with one child for eight days, he told him to go to the other child and eat with him. Once the father came to the son-in-law, who was sitting and eating from a goose; when he saw his father, he hid it and put it under the table. When the father went away and the son wanted to bring the goose out again, a toad had grown out of it, which jumped under the son's face and ate around him, so that he could not get rid of it, it stuck to him so hard, until it devoured everything on him, without stopping, and could not get full or satisfied, so that he died of it. 

They set such examples so that one might see how severely God punishes the children's ingratitude toward their parents, for the disobedience and ingratitude of the youth is exceedingly great. They gladly take what their parents have earned with their hard work, blood and sweat, but they do not want to take it. 


1) Claus Bildenhauer. Bindseil I, 257. 2) This saying also in Lauterbach, p. 31.

175 


not to nourish them again, since the parents make it so hard for them day and night, that they make the children rich and leave them much, at the risk of life and limb, and then they are so despised. 

Alas! the world is evil, soon starts in youth and bloom, therefore God has given the fourth commandment and commanded with great diligence and seriousness: "Honor your father and your mother" 2c., also keeps hard about it. But the Pope, the Antichrist, with his traditions, has dissolved this commandment of God and trampled it underfoot. 


74. a different. (Cordatus No. 872.) 

It seems that old parents who have given their property to their children and are _faithlessly abandoned by them should be advised to do as that wise old man did who was treated contemptuously by his son. For he borrowed money from his neighbor and, shut up in his apartment, he anxiously counted it, and then was kept better. But when death approached, he gave it back to his neighbor, not to his son. 


The children's unequal nature and nature. 

D. M. Luther looked at his children and saw that they were of different natures and kinds, he marveled at God's work and creatures, and said: "Just as the kinds are different, so are the gifts different; indeed, one person is different from another, one has more happiness or unhappiness than another. Therefore, one should look only to God, the Creator and Founder, trust Him and call upon Him. 


76. from Weibern. 

When D. Martin smeared his wife because of the paralysis of her legs, he said: "Some women were smeared, but you smeared me. For the word in Latin, uxor, woman, comes from lubricate, ab unguendo. For when the Gentiles saw that the marriage state had many obstacles and great danger, against all such misfortunes they smeared the posts of the new brides. 


3) "The" put in by us.

Item: When women accept the teaching of the gospel, they are much stronger and more fervent in the faith, much harder and more rigid about it than men; as is seen in dear Anastasia, and Magdalene was more hearty than Peter. John 20. 


77. women should not be eloquent. (Lauterbach, Nov. 4, 1538, p. 156.) 


An Englishman, a learned man, was sitting at the table, but did not understand the German language. Luther said: "| propose my wife to you as a teacher of the German language, for she is very eloquent, she can do it so well that she far surpasses me. But eloquence is not to be praised in women; that they lisp and stammer, that suits them better. 


78. that which is evil to women. 


There is no skirt or dress that looks worse on a woman or virgin than when she wants to be smart. 


79. long hair is a woman's ornament. 


Hair is a woman's best adornment, which is why virgins used to walk in hair and have it beaten into the field when triumphing or mourning and suffering. A fine spectacle is to be seen and suits women very well when they have beaten their hair into the field. 


80. breast milk and female breasts. 


(The first two paragraphs of this § in Lauterbach, Nov. 14, 1538, p. 166.) 

Afterwards they spoke of the power of mother's milk, that it nourished the best. Yes, even calves thrive better on milk than on any other food. So also the children become stronger, which are suckled for a long time. The Swiss, when they are almost grown up, should run to the cows to suckle. 

Then they spoke of the breasts, which would be the adornment of a woman if they were proportioned, because large fleshy breasts were not good, promised much, but produced little. Nerve-rich breasts, however, even if they were small, even in very small women, were very productive, so that they could nurse several children. 


Cap. 3. of creation. § 76-83. 


177 


At another time, Luther said: "Mother's milk is the best, and the children the healthiest, because they are used to it in the womb. And if the children have rough nurses, the children also take after them, as experience shows. Therefore it is unkind and unnatural for a mother not to nurse her child, for God has given her breasts and milk for this purpose. For the sake of the child, God has given her breasts and milk for this purpose, unless she is unable to nurse, in which case necessity breaks iron, as they say. 


81. men, women. (Contained in Cap. 43, Z75.) 


82. what they were created for. 


God created man and woman: the woman to multiply and bear children; the man to nourish and protect. But the world turns it around, abuses the women to fornication, the men's protection to tyranny. Women lack the strength and power of the body and the mind. The lack of strength of the body is to be tolerated, for men are to feed them. The lack of understanding we should wish for them, but we should bear their manners and ways with reason, govern them and keep them a little too well; as St. Peter teaches: "Husbands, dwell with your wives with reason, and give honor to the female, as the weakest instrument, as joint heirs of the grace of life" 2c., 1 Petr. 3, 7. 


Another of the women for whom they were created. 


The Holy Spirit praises the women, as, Judith, Esther, Sara 2c., and among the Gentiles are praised Lucretia, Artemisia. Marriage cannot be without women, nor can the world exist. To be married is a remedy for fornication, which controls it to some extent; for flesh and blood remains unclean for all its kind, until one strikes it with shovels. A woman is a kind, pleasant, and pleasant companion of life. Women bear children and raise them, rule the house and distribute properly what a man brings in and brings about, so that it may be used for counsel.

her husband bear accidents, sickness and misfortune, because of the evil flesh. The law takes wisdom and government from women. This is what St. Paul saw in 1 Cor. 7:10, where he says: "| command, not I, but the Lord", and 1 Tim. 2:12: "| do not permit a woman to teach" 2c. 


The children's faith and life is best, because they have only the word, they stick to it, and give God fine simple honor that he is true, consider certain what he promised and promised. We old fools, however, have heartache and infernal fire, and still dispute long about the word, which they, the little children, believe badly with pure faith, without dispute. And finally, if we want to be saved in any other way, we must give ourselves 87. Children are God's gift. to their word alone, according to their example, as (Cordatus No. 568.) 


Christ says, and with a high oath he prays, saying) as he was playing with his little child, he said: Oh,

Sometimes it also happens unknowingly that we do not think about it.

89. of the increase of fish. (Lauterbach, Feb. 13, 1538, p. 28.) 


After that, when he saw that there were fish on the table, he spoke a lot about divine power in procreation, especially in the waters and in the sea, where one fish produced many thousands, as the roe shows. One fishes every day in the Elbe, and yet it is full of fish. It is unbelievable how the fish multiply and breed, mostly in the sea; for it is said that the ocean at Antorff 1) brings a new kind of fish every four weeks. 


90. the youth bursts forth. 


A young person is like a new must that cannot be held, must ferment and overflow, always wants to be seen and be something in front of others, cannot hold himself in. 


Adam did not eat bread. 


When pears and apples were brought to the table, Luther said: "If Adam had not sinned, there would have been no need for bread, we would have needed only fruit. Then one asked: Why Christ would have eaten after the resurrection? He answered, "Christ did not eat because of need or hunger, but so that he might prove and testify that he was Christ and truly resurrected.

We do not recognize God's creatures. 


When Luther's table was disputed as to how sweet the dew was, Luther answered: "| would never have believed it if the Holy Scripture had not praised the dew itself, since God says Deut. 28:12: Dabo tibi de Rore caeli: "I will give you of the dew of heaven. Alas! Creatura is a beautiful thing: if we are to believe Creationem, tum balbutimus et blaesi sumus, and say Cledo for Cledo, as a child speaks, Lemmel for Semmel. The words are strong, but the heart speaks, Cledo; sed per hoc salvamur, quia cupimus credere. Ah, our Lord God knows well that we are poor little children, if only we would recognize it. The apostles themselves say: Domine, adauge nobis fidem, Luc. 17, 5. But we are all wiser than our Lord God; yes, | myself am also so wise. We cannot understand, nisi per Filium, id est, Christum. This is all his preaching, that he says: Per me, per me, per me, you cannot do it, if you tear yourselves apart; through the Son we are brought to the Father. Therefore, if we only believed that our Lord God was wiser than we, we would already be helped.

1. the godless nature of the world. 

(Cordatus No. 54, and No. 68 to: "eject".) 

The world does not want to have God as God, nor the devil as the devil. Therefore, it is forced to have its governors, the pope and the authorities. - If it were not for God's forgiveness of sins, | would gladly (after all that | am by nature) throw God out through the window; for the world does not respect God at all. As the Psalm also says: Dixit Impius in corde suo, non est Deus. Ps. 14, 1. On the other hand, God is wealth and pleasure to the world, so that it drives its pride and hope and misuses all creatures and gifts of God. Some years ago, a beautiful play and picture was played and seen in Autors 1), where Antorf was finely painted and paraded around the city as a spectacle on a chariot, and this title or name was written above the city: Antorf a queen of the world. And on one side of the city stood Neptunus, a god of the sea, who brought and gave her great treasures. On the other side Mercurius, the merchants’ god, offered her many gifts and goods. This let me be quite a conterfei and kind of the world, in which nothing else is, but contempt of God, pride and court. 

The monks used to boast much about the contempt of the world, and helped themselves with the saying of St. Paul to the Romans in the 12th chapter, v. 2, where he says: "Do not put yourselves in the likeness of this world. For this reason, they did not want to attack money as if it were against God,

125. from borrowing. 

126. from playing. 

127. from binge drinking. 

The world always wants something new, soon gets tired of one thing. 


The use of wealth, money and goods: since St. Paul and the whole of the Holy Scriptures only describe the abuse, the evil lusts, desires and movements of the heart, such as ambition, fornication, revenge, which the world indulges in and is even flooded with. 


2. the insatiability of the human heart, and yet it soon tires of a thing. 


D. Martin said: "He who is now a prince would like to be a king or an emperor. A man who loves a virgin is always thinking how he would like to get her in marriage, and in his eyes none is more beautiful than she. When he has gotten her, he soon tires of her and thinks that another is much more beautiful, whom he could have gotten. So a poor man thinks: If I had a hundred thalers, I would be the richest of all; but when he gets her, he wants to have even more. The heart does not remain constant on a thing, the pagans have also had ab experientia, and said: Virtutem praesentem odimus, sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi. And said Anno 1542 D. Luther then said: When Lucas Cranach, the older painter, had taken his wife and the wedding had taken place, he would always have wanted to be the closest to the bride. He had a good friend who stopped him for a while and said: "Dear, don't do that; before half a year has passed, you will have enough, and there will be no maid in the house; you will prefer her to your wife. And it is so. For praesentia odimus, 


186 


absentia amamus. Of it also Ovidius says: Quod licet, ingratum est, quod non licet, acrius urit. This is imbecillitas nostrae naturae, quod caro praesens bonum non agnoscere potest, sed solus Spiritus agnoscit. So then the devil also comes to it, and throws in the way odia, suspiciones and evil concupiscentias on both sides; hence then comes the running away in matrimony. Therefore a wife is soon taken, but to love her always is donum Dei, and one may well thank our Lord God for it. Therefore, if anyone wants to take a wife, let him be serious, ask God for a pious wife, and say: Dear Lord God, if it is your divine will that | should live without a wife, help me; if not, provide me with a pious husband or wife, with whom | will spend my life, whom | love, and she me again. For copula carnalis does not do it, it must be there, ut conveniant mores et ingenium. 


The world cannot bear good days. (Cordatus No. 693 and No. 696.) 


The world can bear nothing less than happiness. It cannot use good days, it has too weak legs, it becomes arrogant through happiness and despairs in misfortune. Christ alone was able to bear both. Whatever you may do to heal the world is in vain, it is baptism and Chresem [bisem] lost. So God says in Hosea, Cap. 6, [5.], he has planed them. They face nowand as two thousand years ago, because now God's word falls in similar times. Nowadays we have the same argument with the seventh chapter of John, where they said [v. 48]: "Does any ruler or Pharisee believe in him?" So nowadays the bishops and princes of the Lutheran doctrine, Isa. 2. believe, it agrees with the counsels of our time. 

The nature of the opponents of the Word of God is not human, but diabolical. A man does as much as a man can do, but a man possessed by the devil is moved by truly diabolical enmity, and this becomes of such a kind as that between the serpent and the woman, Gen. 3:15. In short, the first table has devils against it, but the second has men against it.

4. useless people. 


In the garden Luther said: "If the useless people all had to die, we would have to become useless, because the devil must have useless servants. Therefore, let them live, because God grants them life. He said this about useless courtiers and other people. 


5. ingratitude of the world for the gospel. 


1) The thanksgiving that the world gives for the teaching of the gospel is the same as that which it gave to Christ, namely the cross. 


6. a different. 


When someone complained about the great ingratitude of the people, D. M. Luther said. M. Luther: This year is a year of ingratitude, but the future and the following will be a year of vengeance. There is no end to it, God must also punish against His will, nature and kind, we will overtake it, Is. 1. 


7. human misery. (Contained in Cap. 48, § 38.) 


8. people kind with food. 

We have all tyrannical animals kind at us with food: the wolf eats sheep, we also; the fox chickens, geese, we also; hawks and vultures eat birds, we also; pikes eat fish, we also. With the oxen, horses, cows we also eat grass; with the pigs we eat dung and dirt, but inside everything becomes dirt. 


9. what people are. 


We are a wicked traveling possession: we want to believe that God will certainly be merciful to us because He has given us His Son, otherwise it is all over and in vain with us. 


10. why God created the world.

Honor and power berveisete. One shall not ask our! 44 Doctor Martin Luther's thoughts of the world while he was 


Lord God, quare hoc facis? Why are you doing this? We should do what we are commanded to do, and after that we should not ask: Quare? Why? We must come to the conclusion that our Lord God is more pious than we are. 


11. where good and evil come from. 


What is good is from God, what is evil is from the devil. Man needs good and courage against God, more than for His praise, therefore "a man's friends are his greatest enemies", Matth. 10, 36. 


12. the world. 


The world does not understand what God's word means, nor do they all want to be evangelical. Now it is said, multi vocati, sed pauci electi: "Many are called, but few are chosen", Matth. 20, 16. 


Why the pagans so beautifully written thing of death. 


| am often surprised, said D. M. Luther, what moved the pagans to write such beautiful things about death, because it is so cruel, horrible and ugly? But when | think of the world, it does not surprise me at all, because they have had to see among themselves many bad things from their authorities, which have hurt them, have been able to punish them with nothing else but death. 

If the pagans held death in such low esteem, yes, so honestly and highly: how much more should we Christians do so! For the poor people knew less than nothing of eternal life; but we know it, nor do we fear, and are so sore afraid, when we are told of death. Well, these are our sins, and we must confess that we live worse than the heathen; therefore we are not wronged. For the greater the sin, the more cruel is death. This is seen in people who have acted against God's commandment and are to die, or that they are told about the last day, how they tremble and rage, even though they are fresh and healthy. We are such herbs. 


still in the cap. 

Since | was in the cap and first began to write, | would not have thought that in the world the devil plagued people so violently. | thought we had the devil only in the monasteries. And it is also possible, because the monks have taken over the world, that the devils have gone into the nobility and peasants; quia multum peccant in rempublicam, they spoil the country and the people, do great harm. 


15. glittering handsome rathgeber. (Contained in Cap. 66, § 58.) 


God always wants to reform the world. (Lauterbach, Nov. 20, 1538, p. 175.) 


Then he spoke of the great foolish folly of men, that we poor people want to judge from God's word, which we should obey, as if the tile wanted to teach the potter how to make it and how many fingers he should use. So we want to set ourselves against God, the wretched creature against the Creator. It says (Matth. 17, 5.): "This (Christ) you shall hear"; and Ps. 45, 11.: "Hear, daughter, look upon it, and incline your ears; forget your people, and your father's house." Yes, if Adam had not fallen, still we would have judged ourselves by the Word alone; and now in such fall and darkness will we despise it. That is why the papal church is the most foolish, which is founded only on the outward discipline of reason, without God's word, with the outward childish antics, to which our salvation should be bound. If only there had been such things, which concern good manners and law. 


The world is unruly, and does not govern itself. (Lauterbach, Nov. 20, 1538, p. 176.) 

The world is not governed by laws and rules, but irregularly [anomalo], like the irregular verb Sum, es, est, eram, fui. There is no regular sequence. Fero, tuli. There are defectives. This has no praeteritum, supina 2c., like the booklet 


190 


"Bellum grammaticale" indicates where the noun and the verb are the two generals; the noun has the pronoun, the verb has the adverbium, the participium goes to both; the preposition and interjection serve both. So it goes also in the world, where cannot be governed with laws. For one must let Sum, es, est

The other group is those who are terrified by the law, feel God's wrath and flee from it, fight and struggle with despair; like Saul. The third group is those who recognize their sin and God's wrath, and feel that they were conceived and born in sin, and therefore must be eternally damned and lost. But when they hear the preaching of the Gospel, that God forgives sin by grace, for the sake of Christ, who was sufficient for us to the Father, they accept it and believe it, and thus become righteous and blessed in the sight of God. Then they prove their faith with all kinds of good works, as fruits that God has commanded. The other two groups go there. 


20. the ingratitude of the peasants. (Cordatus No. 700.) When | said: The farmers are not worthy of such an abundance of goods and the fruits of the earth; | thank 


man. 


God is more learned and wiser than the whole world. (Cordatus No. 690. 691.) 

Erasmus, Oekolampad, Zwingli, Carlstadt want to measure everything according to their wisdom and thus become disgraces; but | thank [God] that | know and believe that God knows more than | do. He can do something higher than | can understand, because He can make visible things out of invisible things, because everything that He is doing now through the power of the Gospel makes visible things out of invisible things. Who would have expected this outcome ten years ago? But the flesh is very godless. 

God forgives our sins for free, but also adds punishment [ultionem] and threats: "If you do not believe, you will die" [John 8:24]. Before believing this and accepting it for nothing, we torture ourselves to

When young chickens were roasted on the table, Christians should thank God for what is present; Doct. Martin Luther to M.

95. a different. The gospel exposes the wickedness of men. 

Just as the cold becomes greater and swifter in winter when the days lengthen and the sun comes closer to us, for it makes the cold denser and compresses it: so also the wickedness of men becomes greater, that is, more apparent, and breaks forth greatly when the gospel is preached; for the Holy Spirit punishes the world for sin, which the world cannot nor will suffer. 


In the pestilence here no farmer wanted to bring in wood, eggs, butter, cheese, grain 2c., so we had to suffer two for one plague, as pestilence and hunger; but if they had it outside, we had to pick it up from them.

Therefore Christ says to Petro, Joh. 21, 15.: "Simon Johanna, do you love me?" and repeats it three times one after the other; after that he said v. 16.: "Feed my sheep". As if to say, "If you want to be a true pastor and shepherd, it must be love that makes you love me; otherwise it is impossible. For who can suffer ingratitude? who can lose his goods and health, and then put himself in the greatest danger? Therefore he says, "It is necessary that you love me. The pope and Turk have smelled us very well and have done her, the world, justice, for she also wants it. She cannot stand righteous, pious, faithful servants of God, yes, she murders them, therefore she must have such companions, nourish them, and moreover hold them in great honor and be cursed and seduced by them. 


The world must have serious and swift rulers. 


The world cannot do without such heads, by whom it must be ruled, even N. N. with his tyranny is like a morsel for the world. Therefore God speaks through the prophet Samuel to the people of Israel, who asked for a king, he wanted to give them a king. "But this was to be his right: Their sons he would take for his chariots and horsemen, their daughters for his cooks; item, their best fields, gardens, vineyards and oil gardens he would take and give to his chamberlains and servants." 1 Sam. 8, 11. ff. Luther then said: "When Prince Frederick returned home from the election day in Cologne, since Emperor Carl had been elected Roman Emperor, His Electoral Grace had elected his most distinguished councilors. Gn. had asked their most distinguished councilor, Mr. Fabian von Feilitzsch, how he liked these new newspapers, that they had elected the King of Hispania as emperor? the same wise man had answered: The ravens must have a vulture.

37. sin goes before punishment. 


Since the Jews were to be beaten, captured and conquered by the Romans, and the land devastated and desolated, they had to crucify God's Son first: so do we, despising God's word, whether we carry it in our mouths or not, and boasting of the gospel, drive out the pastors and faithful pious servants of God and Christians. We still build bastions, ramparts and great mighty fortresses, but we do not build ourselves. 

Jerusalem was also firm, the king of Babylon lay a whole year before it, still it had to go, there helped nothing for it. God also says through Jeremiah: "If you kill all the Chaldeans and leave only three alive, let those three fall in the window and kill you.

Alexander Alesius Scotus wrote from Frankfurt on the Oder that D.

Item, would have decreed over the table that if someone spoke of something different, but of fornication and whores, then he should give a guilder as a penalty. Then M. Luther was moved and angry and said, "He brought this with him from Italy, even though he had despised his parents from childhood. For | once had him up in my room, where his father could not persuade him to have and hear a preceptor, whom he, the father, wanted to assign to him. 

Yes, it is true, as that knave says: The world is and cannot be without sin; but that one would therefore conclude and infer from this: The world is not without sin, therefore sin should be permitted and approved 2c., this does not follow. Just as it does not sound: The church is not without offense, therefore one should let offense go, permit and approve it. It is another to commit fornication and other evil by deed and work, and another by or by right. How we must suffer our unfaithful workers, wicked servants, wicked neighbors; but to approve, to praise, and to say that it is fair and right, that is too much. It should come to this, as with the Lacedeemonians, who allowed stealing and let it go, but so that someone would handle it artificially, masterfully, and steal. | do not believe that the Lacedemonians approved of thievery, but wanted to arouse the fathers of the house to greater diligence and to stimulate them to pay more attention to their thing. If it were right to commit fornication and thievery, the comedians would have allowed it, too, and would not have insisted so much that young journeymen would marry.

The world's speeches and essence. (Lauterbach, Jan. 15, 1538, p. 10.) 

Then it was said of the disloyalty of a courtier of the bishop of Mainz, who had fallen away from the gospel to the papacy and said with great certainty: "I will put Christ behind the door for a while, until | become rich, then | will bring him in again. Similarly, a certain atheist (xxxxx) said: If you want to be deathly timid, you will never get rich. Such remarkable, exceedingly ungodly sayings deserve the greatest punishment. If one could end this, that he could put God behind the door and pull him out again, if he wanted to, then man would have acted well; then God would be their prisoner. These are the words of the Epicureans and the last times, which challenge God's great plague and the Last Judgment. 


(40) How people forget their blessedness for the sake of temporal goods. 

Doctor Luther was asked at Eisleben in 1546 over the table: How is it that people in the world are so stingy and stingy, and everyone wants to be rich, even often with his soul's damage? There was also an example of a nobleman who said: "In the old days, when | was young, it would not go with me: if | had to clothe my wife and child, | had no money; | did not know how it would work. But when | began to put the sea-oak on my back, | became rich and came into money and property. If | had not done that, | would have remained poor for the rest of my life; it was all the sea creature's fault. 

Then D. Luther started and said to D. Jonah: "Doctor, don't you know what Astche von Kram 2), the knight, said to me in Wittenberg, that someone had once said to him: "My dear, if you want to become rich, powerful and great, you must drill a hole in a tree, put your soul in it, and drive a stake in front of it so that it stays inside. When you have become rich, then go and take the peg from the tree. 


2) Assa von Kram; cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, col. 488.

met your soul out of it again. Then Doctor Jonas said: How, if someone would come in the meantime, and take away the sea-oak from the tree? Then Doctor Luther said, "I'll let him take care of that, | wouldn't dare. 

To this the doctor said of usurers that one spoke now in Saxony: 

Who says that usury is a sin. The hefft no money, dat glaube fri. 

But |, D. L., say against it: 

Who saws, that usury no sin si. Die hefft kein GOtt, dat glaub nur fri. 

Then said D. Luther said, "| would like to prevent avarice and usury and even eradicate them, but | am not able to do so; but this | would like to prevent, so that avarice and usury do not become rife. In the same way, | would gladly control stealing, adultery and fornication, so that they would not be used, and so that such sins and vices would not become rampant and rule. For we preachers must oppose sins and punish them severely, otherwise we must hear the curse that is written in Isaiah Cap. 5, 20: Vae vobis, qui malum dicitis bonum. | must do like my cousin Fabian Kaufmann, who went for a walk in SpeckO and wanted to sleep inside: now he comes to a place where there was a whole nest full of snakes lying in a heap. When the snakes came to him, he drew his sword and struck under them, cutting off the head of one and the tail of the other, thus destroying the nest. So | cannot prevent a snake from entering my garden, but if | come across it, | slay it and pin it to a fence; therefore | can prevent it from making a nest inside. 2) Neither can | hinder the vices, that they should not be, but that they should not rule and reign in me, and be changed into morals, and even become prevalent. Rom. 6, 12. For the pagan Seneca says: Deest remedii locus, ubi ea, quae vitia fuerunt, in mores abeunt.

41. world before the flood, as it was. (Cordatus No. 1407.) 


The world before the flood was very learned because of its long experience, but also the godlessness was very great, therefore it also came to ruin. But now we have to die soon and we are not allowed to come to a greater knowledge than is necessary to feed the belly. 


The world does not want Christ as God. (Cordatus No. 1383.) 

The world does not want the corporeal God, who is born, lives, is crucified, much less the one who reproves sins; to him they cry: Death, death. On the other hand, it seeks and worships the incorporeal God with great effort and honors him with great cost. 


43 The world’s likeness. It reminds me of the world as of a dilapidated house: David and the prophets are rafters, Christ is the pillar in the middle of the house, which holds it all. 


44, world seeks immortality from its pride. 

D. M. Luther spoke of the world's hope. Because all people feel and recognize, even see, that they must die and pass away, everyone seeks immortality here on earth, so that he may be remembered forever. At one time, great kings, princes and lords sought it by erecting great marble pillars and very high pyramids, buildings and pillars, arranged in squares, and always the higher the more pointed, so that they thought they would become immortal, as they do now with great churches, magnificent, splendid houses and buildings. Warriors chase and strive for great honors and praise with victories and glorious victories. Scholars seek an eternal name by writing books, as we see now in our time. But they do not look to the eternal, imperishable honor and eternity of God. Alas, we are poor people. 


45. world always decreases the longer. (Lauterbach, Jan. 2, 1538, p. 2.) Dear God, how has the world declined from the time when the imperial rights were given to the people?

Since a maiden of twelve years of age was marriageable and a boy of fourteen years of age was considered manable. Now they are much too weak in such years. The world and people's strength is always going down, it is running out.

(The following at Cordatus No. 1274.) Weeds grow soon, so the girls grow faster than the boys. 


47. common state of the best. 


To be and live in a public state, which God has appointed, is the most secure, because Christ also lived and walked in a public state among people. And warn His own, when He says Matth. 24, 26: "If they say, Behold, He is in the wilderness; go not out; or, In chambers; believe it not." And in such corners they have led the most shameful boyish life. Among people in public, one must be civil and honest, and shy away from God and man. 


48. how to grow old. 


If you want to grow old, grow old soon, keep your collar warm, don't fill your bowels too visibly. 

Don't get too close to the Grethen, So you'll slowly turn gray. 


49. man's body. (Cordatus No. 1137 and No. 719.) 

The human body is a shameful sack of lye, through which nothing else flows but evil sweat, urine, saliva and more rivers than it has limbs. | experience this on my leg, which | recently opened again by rubbing, and as if from paradise, four rivers began to burst out. 

When he took his little Martin, he said: "Oh, that God can put such fine black eyes into a piece of meat from a stinking sack. It reminds me just now, as if | took

50. man cannot comprehend God's gifts. (Cordatus No. 416.) 


The very great gifts and goods of God cannot be grasped by the human heart, therefore the shepherds Luc. 2, are dismayed; so also we are often dismayed when God opposes us in the most friendly way. 


The world's judgment of the ministers of the gospel. 


To restore and comfort a despondent and afflicted conscience is much more than having many kingdoms. But the world does not respect it, even despises it; it calls us rebels, disturbers of peace and blasphemers, who pervert and change the doctrine. Verily it will prophesy itself, though we see it with great sorrow of heart. So the Jews also say of Christ, John 11:48: "If we let him go, the Romans will come and take away our land and our people" 2c. But when they had killed Christ, they did not come? Yes, | mean, they came and made a mess of them. So the despisers and enemies of the word will destroy the peace and turn Germany around, so that it will go over and over and lie in ashes, when we are now carried away. So they want to have it.

The world begrudges the Christians their food and would like to have all the goods for themselves. 


Doctor Luther once said: "If a poor man had a good field or meadow, those of the nobility would soon begrudge it to him, seeking to overtake him. So did the centauri of the king of Gerar, Abimelech's court, do to Isaac the pious patriarch: for when they saw that Isaac had gotten a hundredfold fruit of the field which the king had let him, they came quickly, and stirred up the king against him, that he took Isaac's field again. Gen. 26: For they thought: The field bears much, therefore it must be ours: it is a fruitful land, we are nearer to it than he. Why did we rent it to lsaac? We would rather have it ourselves. They think that if they get the land back, they will soon become rich. He had a hen that laid a golden egg for him every day, and he thought, "There will be a great treasure in that hen, and she will have a golden ovary. So he thought he would get rich all at once, and strangled the hen, and took out the stick, and found nothing. Sic et nostri Principes jam nihil aliud agunt, quam ut fiant maledicti a Deo. They also push Isaac out to the land, but they do not know that Benedictio Dei is with him, and that they find maledicti. 


The world, especially Germany, certain punishment. (Lauterbach, Sept. 15, 1538, p. 131.) 


On the 13th Sunday after Trinity, September 15, he gave a very serious exhortation to prayer against the future plagues of Germany from the Turks, the Pope and the mobs, which we caused by our impenitence. Therefore the punishment must come. God turn the evil! For the whole world is nothing else but an inverted decalogue, vain contempt [of God], vain blasphemy, vain disobedience, fornication, courtiers, thieves, is almost ripe for the slaughter: so the devil does not celebrate through the Turk, the Pabst and the Rotten. 


57. what to consider in official capacity. 


If | did not let myself get angry from the bottom of my heart for the sake of the man who died for me, the world would not be able to give me enough money to write a book or to interpret something in the Bible. | want to have my work unrewarded by the world, it is too small and poor for that: | have never asked my lord in Saxony for a penny, because | have lived here. 


58. a different. (Cordatus No. 1266.) 


All wickedness has now come together in one heap. This is seen in lending, because many, provoked by the gospel, would like to lend, but there is no one to give back. It is like borrowing to him, like finding. | have been much deceived by such boys. It is to lend and to give back. 


59. the world's folly. (Cordatus No. 1278.) 


Great is the folly of men who value gems not according to their goodness [a virtute], but according to their estimation. A turquoise for three hundred guilders, which has no proven value. Therefore, Claus Fool answered the prince who asked him, since he bought a gemstone, how much he valued it: As much as a rich fool may respect and pay for it. 


The world became more and more angry after the gospel came to light again and was preached. (Cordatus No. 1123.) 


It is a wonderful thing and full of awe that the world has become worse and worse as often as the gospel has had to be preached again. All spiritual freedom of Christ they draw on carnal lust. Therefore, the kingdom of the devil and the pope is the best for the world in outward things, because the world wants to be ruled with laws, with superstition, with lies, with tyranny, and through the doctrine of grace it only gets worse, because it does not believe that there is another, future life after this one. The

proved the one who, when he was dying, threw away his will written on paper, on which only these words were read: | have robbed when | could, you also rob when you can. [Dum potui, rapui; rapiatis, quando potestis.] 


61. what the world is. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1419. The following in Cordatus No. 1454 and No. 1621). 

1) The world is an assembly of people who receive all the benefits of God with ingratitude. He who has not come to know the world, let him go to a monastery. 2) 

The world did not sit faith, love, the cross. It does not grasp faith, therefore it does not practice love, through which faith is active. It also cannot want to suffer the cross, through which faith is practiced and increased. 

Since faith is trust in God, who is merciful in His essence, it is frightening that the world despises it and thinks that faith is only an opinion of God, who is angry and demands only justice. And, just as the world does not want faith, it also does not want that with which faith, love and the cross have to do [objecta], namely God, the neighbor, the adversary. Because it considers God an enemy, it looks at no one but itself, and considers the friend an adversary. Therefore, the world cannot understand the first commandment of God and the commandment of the neighbor, but inevitably hates God and what is His, the Word and His saints. It loves itself and its own in all things, it seeks the devil and the honor of the flesh and its peace. 


Nothing happens to thank the world. (Cordatus No. 1352.) 

One can never do right to the world nor preach. When the Pabstacy is preached, the conscience is violated; but when you preach Christ, you cause offense. 


1) Regarding the first paragraph, cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol: XI, 894, § 25. 


2) There he will come to know the ingratitude of the world. 


Cap. 4. of the world and its kind. § 60-65. 


205 


by the flesh and the papacy; but if you preach the flesh, you offend Christ. The world remains the world, and if Christ cannot help it, we will leave it at that. But who is it that believes this? It is not that they want to believe, but that they see. 


63. imitate what it is. (Cordatus No. 1353.) 


Imitation is a devilish and human thing, therefore it is simply harmful or at least useless. Thus, heretics imitate the word of God, hypocrites imitate the works of faith, idolaters imitate ceremonies, tyrants and reckless people imitate war, fools imitate the government, clumsy people imitate the crafts, asses imitate the arts. Therefore, when GOD sets up his word, works, arts 2c. in the world, he also makes monkeys, and the [great multitude follows the monkeys. But it is GOD alone who sustains the remaining examples [prototypias]. Thus is the world from the beginning. 


64. no punishment helps in the world. 


The world is not improved by any punishment, it does not change, it balks and barks against it. As the farmers say when the Elbe has run out and drowned and ruined everything in the field: "If you have drowned my grain, you have not drowned my thalers. Well, God can lend you a good pittance, but after that he comes and demands a serious reckoning, so that you keep neither skin nor hair. For such prideful presumption has never gone unpunished. 


The world does not respect God's gifts and works. 

(Here 21 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 2, § 49.) 

(Cordatus No. 434.) 

If God did not give His blessings to the earth for only one year, how great would be the lamentation among the people! But now, since He gives everything abundantly, they are very ungrateful. 


3) The year 1531 was very fruitful. 


206 


The world does not do anything for free. 


The world is so selfish that it does nothing for nothing, but wants to have everything rewarded. As this fable indicates, D. Martinus said: One rented his donkey to another and walked beside him; but he sat on it, because the sun shone so hot and stung him, he asked the master [of the donkey], he wanted to sit on it, and also let him walk a little in the shade, but he would not and said: He had rented him the donkey to ride, and not the shade of it, the same he should pay him specially, because he wanted to have it. This fable is a conterfection and a picture of the bet, which does nothing in vain, and does not want to give or grant the shadow. 


How the world rewards and rewards good deeds. (Lauterbach, Apr. 5, 1538, p. 57.) 


Philip told an excellent story of ingratitude in the chariot. A farmer was walking around and being tired, he rested beside a cave. In ita snake was hidden and enclosed, calling him and asking him to free it. If it would be freed, it wanted to give him the best reward and thanks on earth. When the stone was rolled away and the snake was freed, it wanted to kill the farmer, saying that this was the way of the world against its benefactors. But since he expected a greater reward, he appealed to a court of law; the animal which first met them was to decide the matter. There a horse was brought, old and worn out, which should be killed. It answered: "I'm doing fine. Now that I've pulled my heart out, they want to flay me and beat me to death. Then an old dog, which had been driven away, complained about its master in the same way. He demanded a third judge. They met a little fox, who said, because he was clever, "| must see how the liberation happened. And to him were given all the fowls [of the farmer] price, if he were delivered [from the serpent]. The fox went into the cave with the snake and immediately jumped back. The farmer put the stone in front of it again, but when the little fox came by night to fetch the chickens, it was killed by the 


Cap. 4. of the world and its kind. § 66-69. 


207 


wife and the servant were killed. Luther answered: This is a picture of the world. Whoever is helped from the gallows brings one up. If | had no example, it would be Christ, who delivered the whole world from hell, and he is crucified by his people. 1) 


How grateful the world is for God's benefits. (Lauterbach, Aug. 2, 1538, p. 106.) 

After that, they told about the people's blasphemies and grumbling because it rained in the harvest and they had been punished with drought before. He replied: "So God must be thanked, and if God had not spared the world because of a few believers, it would have long perished. It must also have hurt the pious King Solomon very much when he wanted to rest in his old age and handed over the government to his sons, that they loved gifts and gold more than justice. 


The world soon forgets God's benefits and despises His word. (Lauterbach, Aug. 27, 1538, p. 122.) 

On August 27, Luther lamented the future misfortune of Germany because of the contempt for God and the Word, and because of the wickedness that follows from it. For as soon as people begin to fall away from God, which is the origin of all hope, as Jesus laments in Sirach Cap. 10, all sins go by force, as we, unfortunately, see today that the race has become so insolent in a short time, provoking the wrath of God. This is what happened to the inhabitants of Sodom, who, while Abraham, the hero who freed them from four kings, was still alive, forgot about God's benefits and even despised Abraham, who taught them. Then religion, worldly rule and good manners also perished and the plague soon followed; although the Jews belittle the sins of the Sodomites, namely that they had killed a very benevolent girl, who gave alms, in an outrageous way. But the

The world, especially our ingratitude, will help the papacy out again. 


D. M. Luther pleaded diligently for the course of the pure doctrine of the Gospel, and against heresy and the papacy. For if the pope were to come back into power, he would duplicate his tyranny and make it illegal. As he did after the Costnitz Conciliar, he has honestly smelled himself for the hundred years since he was deposed, and has introduced very ungodly profanation and abominations.

When | think of my companions who grew up with me, they are very thin and almost all gone. For now every twenty years a new world is created. Then Bildenhauer said that he remembered that four Electors had ruled in Saxony, and what a fine time it had been then, when Duke Albrecht and Ernst had ruled with each other, and both had stayed together with two wives in Torgau. Thereupon spoke D. Martinus said: "At that time there were pious people, now it is the devil that no one may trust the other. The princes are very tyrannical and use force. 


Of the ingratitude of the people. 


Just as the Israelites did to Mosiah, who led them out of Egypt, so do we now, who have been led out of the prison and house of service of the Antichrist in Rome. But he prayed for them. | pray that the boys will be punished. 

Aristotle, the pagan, tells of several causes why one may be justly angry, one of which is ingratitude. Scipio, the noble hero of Rome, was able to

And just as God spoke to Moses verbally, as one good friend to another; so He also speaks to us verbally through the preachers, as Christ says Matt. 10:20: "It is not you who speak, but your Father's Spirit who speaks through you." We despise the same. 


The world's presumption and certainty and Epicurians. (Lauterbach, Jan. 1, 1538. p. 1.) 

On January 1, in the year of the Lord 38, he sharply examined M. G. Karg, who had been summoned to the sacristy, because he had cursed himself in a whimsical presumption in a letter to his best friend: If Christ offered him the kingdom of heaven, he would not accept it at this hour, because he did not want to keep it with Luther in the article. Since this letter had come before the Elector through his friend, it was then handed over to D. L. with the strictest order that he should be imprisoned in the castle; but D. L. examined him beforehand in the sacristy. Then the quaestor took him and put him in prison against all the privileges of the university. After that, he was released from prison on the first of February and was imprisoned in his room by intercession. Luther's. At home the doctor sighed and said: "How great is the presumption and certainty of the world! What is only a little something dares to offend Christ and to lift its foot against Him. It will get even better, epicurism will arise with force, because the world, the despiser of the Word of God, is nothing but a preparation for epicurism before the last day, who believes neither in God nor in another life. Is it not terrible that among the people of God there are such epicurists? not only in private and hidden, but also publicly in office, in glory, 


1) Interrogation of M. Georg Karg in the Sacristy in the presence of D. Jonas, D. Cruciger and Melanchthon. Cf. Luther's letter to the Elector about this matter, dated Jan. 4, 1538, in Walch, old edition XXI, 410, where Rérer is not mentioned, nor in Lauterbach.

like the Sadducees were among the Jews, ruling in religion and yet believing nothing of the future life and also teaching so. Such people are our papists today, who know the Scriptures and yet consider them a dream. The bishop of Mainz says and does what he wants. Leipzig is drowned in such avarice that they take 45 florins a year out of 100 florins under the pretense of piety. For that must be love, that one lends 100 florins. Justice is that one gives 45 guilders for it. In ten years, 100 florins carry 1000, isn't that epicurism? Leipzig is drowned deeper in the sea of avarice than the mountains of Arabia under the flood of sin, which lay only fifteen cubits under the floods, but Leipzig lies fifteen miles under the floods of avarice. So are all the others. Ah, evil times are yet to come. Our Epicureans are worse than the Cardinals of Italy, who said: We want to let others be pious, even if we ourselves do not want to. 


The world's impiety and ingratitude. 


God entices us with promises, both in the Law and the Gospel, so that we "may hear His word; but the world and the wicked not only do not respect it, but also despise it and persecute it. Therefore they are justly condemned, and it serves them right that they should become beggars, and also here temporally be put to shame.

The canons of Wurzburg, Mainz and Cologne have the best days, live in idleness, feasting and damming, have everything in stock, without any worries, what their heart desires, and then go happily to heaven, where it sizzles. The bishops do not have it so good, because they are in the regiment and have to do to some extent with the trades.

Dear God, twenty years ago | would not have thought that even now there should be Epicureans in the Christian Church, since almost all Romanists are drowned in the Epicurean life, caring neither for God nor for a good conscience. These are horrible times. | used to think that the Epicurean sect had died out long ago, but it still flourishes, because Epicurism has set its intention on this life, leads people from the eternal to the temporal. Such people were Pomponius Atticus, Scipio and other very wise people, in whom God shows the foolishness of human reason, although Cicero, in his letter to Octavius, has indicated his opinion of eternity. Nevertheless, there was a high intellect in Cicero, who concluded from reason that it was safer to surrender to the opinion that there is an eternal life after this than that everything is temporal and transitory; and it is also certainly true that it is much more certain according to reason that one should surrender to Christianity than to Epicurism. For if a man is deceived by the delusion of Epicurus, he has lost the eternal for the temporal. But if Christianity deceives him (which is impossible), he has lost only the temporal for the eternal. God protect us all from this opinion, in which the whole world now walks.

After that, people complained about the epicurism of our time, where noblemen, burghers and peasants care neither about God nor about eternity. Luther answered: "Do not be surprised by this in the last times; consider how it happened in the time of Christ in the people of the Most Holy God, when besides the Pharisees there were also Sadducees in the regiment, good fellows who believed nothing.

The Fuggers can, said D. Martinus, in a hurry raise fa ton of gold five or six, which the emperor is not able. N. Fugger has left at 18 tons of gold. It is said that the Fuggers and Welsers once lent the emperor twelve ons of gold in the war before Padua. Augsburg is able 0 raise thirty tons of gold in three weeks; the emperor cannot.

Anno 30, June 16, a student at Wittenberg, who had written many ungodly questions in his book, wanted to turn the Scriptures according to his head and almost cause a new epicurism, pretending that there were neither good nor evil angels, and many horrible things about the Holy Spirit and the resurrection of the dead 2c. The professors punished him severely for this and denounced it to D. Martino, who said with a sigh: "Dear Lord God, what will become of this? Oh how terrible times we will have! The authorities should severely punish such epicureans, like other public offenders.

He said that he had given him six thousand guilders, which he would have put in his coat and carried with him, so that his servants would not have noticed it. But the doctor said: He would have liked to believe that with the sheet of cards, because in former times small letters would have been written, and great faith would have been held. But to lead the money, so that it would not be noticed, seemed to him a little too mildly spoken. 


The world's stinginess. (Cordatus No. 1482. 1483.) 


When Pommer returned from the places to which he had been called, he brought a hundred florins as a gift to the doctor, because he would have deserved them, since he had served in his [Bugenhagen's] office. He did not want to accept it, and since they argued with each other and Pommer said that many of the people would otherwise say that he was ungrateful, the doctor replied: "For their sake | will not take it, because they would judge Pommern, who is righteous, but they are the most ungrateful of all.

91. the parish priests and preachers avarice. (Cordatus No. 1090.) 

My dear priests also begin to be stingy, always wanting to give a penny or two more than other people, since it behooves them to set a good example for the farmers by going down from such a high price. So it is a bad profit, so that they make themselves bad consciences and give bad examples. Fie on you, you miser. 


92: The virtues of Mammon. 


Mammon has two virtues: the first is that he makes us safe when things go well, and live without fear of God. The other is that in times of trouble, when things go badly, he teaches us to tempt God, to flee from God, and to seek a foreign god. 


93: Pabst's stinginess. (Lauterbach, Feb. 2, 1538, p. 19. The last paragraph, Aug. 4, 1538. p. 107.) 

Pabst's avarice has been the greatest and most insolent, and the devil has chosen Rome for him. That is why the ancients said: Roma radix omnium malorum avaritia. [The first four letters form the word Roma. of all evil]. 1) And | found this verse in a very old book: 


Versus amor Mundi Caput est et Bestia Terrae. °) 


For it would be an abominable handling of avarice, to snatch everything to oneself without the work of hands, without preaching, without the service of the church, but only with superstition and selling of their works. Hence Peter describes their avarice in the strongest terms [2 Pet. 2:14.], "They have a heart smitten with avarice." | believe that no one can recognize the nature of avarice unless he knows Rome, for all other deceptions, frauds, avarices are nothing against the Roman superstition. Therefore, at the Diet in Worms, the

His Imperial Majesty wanted to abolish it, or they wanted to abolish it. There, they were waiting for my writing "To the German Nobility," which was made known to me by Doctor Wick. At that time, the course of the Gospel began very well, but the three sects, Carlstadt, Munzer and the Anabaptists, hindered it very much. Nevertheless, God promoted it and abolished it through me, without my doing. There is truly a great power of the papacy over all kings and rulers, and | have put this down in the one booklet "Against the Ban". | did not intend to write this booklet against the papacy, but against the abuse. But they were soon frightened, because their conscience accused them. 

Luther was told about the tenacity of a very dirty miser who denied his fortune to his own body. He answered: He collects treasures, and does not know for whom? Let us eat and drink as we please, and thank God for His bounty. Others will eat after us. 


94. stinginess prevents God's blessing. (Lauterbach, Aug. 5, 1538, p. 110.) 


On that day came his brother Jacob Luther and M. Mich. Célius and complained a lot about Count Albrecht [of Mansfeld] that he was the ruin of his people. Luther said: "| am sorry that you have to suffer so much because of his wickedness, so that God's blessing is hindered. [For when GOD gives common blessings,] as with mines, and a person wants to appropriate it and take GOD captive, GOD flees with His blessings. He wants to be freely uncaptured in His gifts. 


The first is that the monasteries and ecclesiastical estates should be seized by princes and lords. 


Doctor Luther once said about the table that a true proverb was: "That the goods of the church are wealthy goods, and that the goods of the church do not prosper. And that is what one has from experience, that those who have drawn spiritual goods to themselves end up impoverished and become beggars. 


And thereupon he said: Burkhard Hund, Elector Hansen of Saxony, would have said: We of the nobility have drawn the monastery estates under our manors; now the monastery estates have eaten and consumed our manors, so that we have neither monastery estates nor manors anymore. And Doctor Luther told a nice fable about this and said: "Once upon a time, an eagle made friends with a fox, and they agreed to live together. When the fox had made all friendship with the eagle, he had his young in our tree, where the eagle had his young eagles. But the friendship did not last long, for as soon as the eagle did not have food to bring to his young, and the fox was not with his young, the eagle flew down and took the fox's young, and led them into his nest, and let them eat the young eagles. When the fox returned, he saw that his young had been taken away, so he complained to the supreme god Jovi that he wanted to avenge Jus violati hospitii and punish this injuriam. Not long after, when the eagle again had nothing to feed his young, he saw that in a place in the field they sacrificed to Jovi. Therefore he flew there and quickly took a roast from the altar, and brought it to the young eagles in the nest, and flew away again and wanted to get more food. But a glowing coal was left on the roast; when it fell into the nest, it set the nest on fire, and when the young eagles could not fly, they burned with the nest and fell to the earth. And Doctor Luther then said: "That is what happens to those who seize spiritual goods, which are given for God's honor and for the preservation of the ministry of preaching and the service of God: they must lose their nest and young, that is, their manors and other worldly goods, and also suffer harm to body and soul. 

At another time, Doctor Luther said: "That the spiritual goods have eagle feathers of a kind and nature; for where they are put with other feathers, they devour and consume them. Thus, if the spiritual goods are placed per fas et nefas among other goods 


222 


If the two are mixed together, they also consume them, so that one of them ends up with nothing at all. 

There was one in Wittenberg, named Severus, who had been preceptor of the Roman king Ferdinandi's sons, who went to Doctor Luther's table. He had said about Doctor Luther's table: There had been a dog in Linz, which had been used to fetch meat from the meat banks in a basket. But when other dogs came to him and wanted to take the meat, he put down the basket and bit his way through them. If they had overpowered him, he would have fallen into the basket with his mouth first and caught a piece of meat, so that he would also get some of it. Then said D. Luther said: "This is exactly what our emperor Carl is doing now; after he has long defended the ecclesiastical goods, and now sees that every prince is seizing the monasteries and convents, he is now also seizing the bishoprics; as he recently seized the bishoprics of Utrecht and Liége, so that he might also get partem de tunica Christi. 


96. avarice disrupts and devastates the country and its people. (Lauterbach, Oct. 2 and 7, 1538, p. 140 f.) 

On October 2, he lamented the very miserable confusion of the worldly regime due to the devilish avarice, which hindered all worldly justice, obligations, orders and contracts; everyone was looking to accumulate a lot of money. 1) The stingy do not esteem grain and food as highly as money, which they cannot eat. The world is still all about money, as if soul and body depended on it. God and the neighbor are despised, mammon is served. Dear, look at our times, how the very stingy noblemen, burghers and peasants trample religion underfoot, chase away the preachers by great hunger. If they do not want to build our Lord God's house, their house will fall apart again, as the prophets Haggai and Malachi have said to their despisers.

They were threatened by those who did not want to give anything for worship; therefore God would not give them anything, but they would perish through famine and war. Look at the passages of the prophets there; will it not be the same in our time? There will come terrible times, almost worse than over Sodom 2c. 

On October 7, | [Lauterbach] was forced to go to Grtinau [Grunnaw] to fetch D. Martin home, who was tied up there by the stone of D. Jonas. Jonas, who was suffering from a severe seizure, and said to Jonas: You must be patient and already live according to the laws, for such are the cases of the world, as Terence (Adelph. IV, 8, 21.) says, "as if we played with dice"; we want to move to joys, so we come to suffering. 


97. from a stingy farmer. (Lauterbach, Oct. 23, 1538, p. 156.) 


It was reported in letters that a rich farmer had recently brought his grain to the city for sale; but since no one wanted to buy it at his price, he is said to have said: | don't want to give it closer, | would rather go home and let the mice eat it. When he had done this, such a large number of mice suddenly gathered in his house that they gnawed all his grain with a great noise. When he fled from his house to his field, he also found his seeds freed and destroyed by the mice; the others were unharmed. To this Luther said: If this is true, it is a certain sign of God's punishment, but unfortunately! of the ungrateful world a sign of wrath. 


98. D. M. L. Admonition and warning against avarice. 


In the year 39, the Lord was very angry and vehement against the stinginess of the peasants, who throw away the grain and leave it lying around until it becomes expensive: that, praise God, he said, three peasants have hanged themselves all ready. Such fellows, who rob and toil the whole land, are worthy of such punishment. For this theurge is a wanton theurge. God

used to paint a cross. This should mean that the devil should have no power or authority in these places. When a stranger saw this in one place and did not know what the cross and the three letters meant, he asked one of them; the latter answered him and said: "The three letters mean the virtue of princes, counts and noblemen, because they now want to be cretzmars and alehouses, item, millers and brewers and take to themselves all trades and civil food. When the other asked what the cross written over it meant, he replied: "It means that one should beware of them. This must have been a real prankster who interpreted the letters in this way. 


The nobility has a fine and honest food, so does the peasant, because agriculture is a divine food, and the dear patriarchs also had this food, because this food comes straight down from heaven. But what do the nobles do? They scratch and scrape, proliferate, and are in a state of upheaval, and have the falbel, 2) because they want to make their children princes and lords. Some of them are so stingy that they would like to give their children an annual income of ten thousand guilders. Then the children turn out badly, and our Lord God blows into the badly won property, so that everything is pulverized and torn to pieces. Oh, that one should get rich by stealing, it does not do.

In the twenty years that | have seen the world, | have seen so many miserable cases and miseries that it is exceedingly clear that you will also see how our citizens here will fare; they will not bring their usurped and ambitious goods to the third heir. 

The old Margrave Joachim, Elector of Brandenburg, once said to Duke Frederick of Saxony: "How do you princes of Saxony strike such heavy coins? In our regiment alone, we have won about three tons of gold from it. Behold, this has happened in about forty years. The land was open to him, he could bring the good coin out, melt it in the crucible, and have Markian pennies struck from it, and bring the same coin back to the Electorate. But where does this good come from? It is a pitiful thing that people are so blind and do not see such things, quod quando peccant, tum sibi ipsis ruinam parant. As the Holy Scripture says in the 73rd Psalm, v. 18: "Dejicis eos, dum attolluntur." It is a hard word: "Tolluntur in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant." Now the noblemen have thought up a new discovery and say: "May | not do what | want with what is mine? They have learned this from the Gospel. Nun? Yes, the knife is mine, so | may stick it in the neck. It is true, they are Domini Suarum rerum, sed non alienarum. If | give one five florins for ten, what is that? are they not thieves and robbers? 

Two of them were reported to D. Martino that they made theft with the grain, as Friedrich B., Tylo D., 1) and was asked: Whether they also had the power to hinder the grain of land on the common market? Luther answered: "It is only human malice; what would happen if God's punishment were to come? Oh, dear Lord God! If the world is so evil, | will gladly die, even of hunger, that | may get away. Then he said to the mayor, "The bailiff is a cause, who has had some grain carried away on ships. As he once said: "If the citizens would

If he could not make good beer and sell it cheaply, he would make the barley expensive before they wiped their mouths. This speech of his makes me suspect him. God has blessed us wonderfully in this sandy land, more than the Thuringian soil, which is a land rich in grain. 

On May 14, Friedrich B[randt] sent to D. M. Luthern and apologized for the suspicion, as if he should pour out the grain and be in the company of the envelope; indicated that D. Martin's letter had moved him very much; asked, he did not want to believe such from him. D. Martin answered and said: | have admonished and warned him, but conscientia mille testes adest, conscience is there, that will convince him, tell him: Hoc fac, et vives: do this, and you will live.

103. stinginess takes away God's blessings. (Lauterbach, Apr. 3, p. 54.) 

After that, some tyrants were remembered who, out of avarice, oppressed their subjects and lost the blessing of God, mowing down everything in the purest way, as Ferdinand, Duke George and [Count] Albrecht of Mansfeld did in the mine, which they would not build on their own. It is an atrocious thing about the insatiable greed that would kill itself. As it is said of Duke George, when he had filled a spacious vault with silver and thalers, he is said to have said: Come back first, what we may not bring in here, we want to find another place. Moses did not wrongly command (Deut. 19, 10.) that the vine and the harvest should not be cut down so purely, but also left for the poor. But because avarice is insatiable, there is no end to the gathering of treasure, because such people hinder the blessing of God to themselves and others. 


104 On the Avarice of the Thuringian Peasants. (Lauterbach, May 21, 1538, p. 84.) Erfurt used to be very productive in terms of crops, but now it is subject to the curse. It is more expensive there than in Wittenberg. | saw this a year ago

and considered, because they had small bread and black bread. Oh, no one takes care of the worldly regiment. They only collect money, and so we lose the blessing of God. They have such wine wax there that one can give a jug for three pennies; if they had only half the wine wax, they would be very rich. But since the wine was in great quantity, they could not deny it, gave the wine for the wood. 


105. Christians should not be stingy. 


When people complained about the great stinginess of the people, even at the time of the Gospel, that they did not want to help anyone in need, D. M. Luther said. M. Luther said: "Well, let it be that our hearts are not inclined to give, but a Christian should be mindful of his position and office and of love, so that he may be charitable and gladly give, and give to the poor who are in need, and do it witha cheerful heart, for the sake of God, who will reward it abundantly, as He promised in Luc. 6, 38: "Pray, and it shall be restored unto you"; as Solomon says, Proverbs 19, 17: "He that giveth to the poor lendeth to God by usury." Just as again the Strauesgitlein i) are, who waste and spill everything; as the wise pagan Seneca said to a waster: You have a plague and disease, which is called, Gaudens dando, have desire and joy to give and use everything there. For such a waste is also not to be praised, as one who despises rationality and gives away _ without distinction and need. 


106. of the avarice of the people, especially when the gospel is taught. 


We now learn, said D. Martinus, since people are taught righteously about God and worship, as well as about right good works, how even an abominable avarice has possessed the hearts of almost all and most of them. No one shows charity to the poor, as he should; they devise various ways and means to increase all things and goods and to make the most of them. 


1) Straues from: to scatter, to disperse; hence the opinion of the word "Strauesgitlein": those who are too good, so that they waste everything, squanderers. 


Cap. 4. of the world and its kind. § 104-109. 


229 


even in the most trivial matters. But what is spent on church servants and schools, as such things are very small, is considered great and high. Therefore, it is not only a great shame, but also a great sin at this time, that it is seen that many parishes are either completely deserted or miserably neglected and abandoned because of people's avarice. 

But look at the former times, when there was no true religion and people were led to idolatry and idolatry, and trust in their own self-chosen works; there was no measure nor end to giving, there it was only cutting with all power. Everyone was willing to give, all monasteries full of monks, all monasteries full of chasubles were fed, and enough was given to them, yes, all superfluous: Churches were adorned and decorated with silver and gold in the most beautiful and abundant way, yes, they were showered. Therefore this blindness of the world is to be deplored. 


107. No one lets himself be satistied. 

We are of the kind, said D. M. Luther, if we have a penny, we would like to have a florin, and if we have a florin, we would like to have a hundred 2c.; if | have a candel of beer, | would like to have the barrel of beer. So the peasants do, they would like to be citizens, citizens noblemen, noblemen princes 2c. That is, not to be satisfied in bodily matters, which happens much less in spiritual matters. 


(108) Avarice corrupts and hinders God's blessings. (Cordatus No. 1553.) Grain will never again be bought as cheaply as before, for our sins deserve punishment, and usury has become too great. 


109. stinginess. (Lauterbach) Aug. 8, 1538, p. 111.) 

Old wines are cramped, because wines that are three years old are no longer strong. The godless miserly ones may pack themselves away, which they keep for a long time, until they become nasty. They hinder God's blessing and man's joy, as the bishop of Wurzburg, the

110. of those who are attached to the world's wealth. 


A man who has surrendered to the world's riches and honor, and yet forgets his soul and God, is like a little child who holds in his hand an apple that is beautiful in shape and outward color, and thinks it has something good, but inside it is rotten and full of worms. 


D. M. Luther's Table Talks on Commerce and Usury. 


111. of trafficking and usury. 


A civil and lawful trade is blessed by God, that one out of twenty pennies has one, but an ungodly and unrighteous profit in trade is cursed. Like Melchior Lotther, 1) book printer, who from his books, which | gave him to print, gained a great money, that one penny acquired two. It has carried in the first mighty much, so that Hans Griinenberger, the printer, said with conscience: Doctor, it carries too much, | may not have such copies; it was a God-fearing man, therefore he was also blessed by God. 

(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 595.) 


It would be considered a cheap rate or profit if twenty pennies gained one, which would make five florins from the hundred. But now they simply want a penny to make one or two, and a hundred florins two hundred, and such people do not become rich, at least not in goods that remain to them. 

The Romans have forbidden to take twelve from the hundred, but now they may take all Leipzig markets from the hundred fifteen guilders, that does annually eight and forty guilders, is just the twenty- fifth. Fie you

times! When sin is no longer considered sin, there is neither counsel nor help; but | hope God will come with the last day, as soon as the word of the gospel will cease. 


112. legitimate profit. 


In 42, on July 14, Dominus Jakob Prepositus, pastor of Bremen, came to Wittenberg, who had been Luther's companion and brother in the monastery, an old, pious, sincere, learned and God-fearing man, so that he might see his father, Martinum, once again. Then they talked with each other, and first of all they thought of the usury in which Flanders and the Low Countries were drowned. Thereupon spoke D. M. Luther said: "The whole world is drowned and flooded in usury, so that without any fear or hesitation people steal, rob and steal as much as anyone can; therefore those who have invented and practice it should be punished and condemned. If five or six out of a hundred were taken, we would be satisfied, if only there were a pledge that could bear it. And if such a trial were held that the principal sum should not be claimed by the one who lent it, but by the one who borrowed it, so that the redemption would be with the seller and not with the buyer, we would let it happen that six percent should be taken; for the goods have increased, so that it can be used. But the buyer, who has lent the money, shall also bear the risk if the house burns down or the field is washed away, or falls into ruin, or otherwise suffers noticeable damage, so that it cannot bear or pay the interest. And such danger of the pledge makes this contract right; not the re-purchase or the redemption. Oh, how blessed we would be if we could persuade the people to do so; but the devilish usury and turnover eat up everything, so the emperor in his fatherland gives twelve out of a hundred. Fie on you! 

D. Martin Luther was asked by a pious, God- fearing man who had lent a hundred florins to someone who had asked him against it.

whether he would also do it with a good conscience? Then the doctor said, "It must be a pious man who wants to have a conscience about this; why would he not take one service after another? 


113. from usurers. 


Public usurers are to be banished, as | have now done to the nobleman Heinrich Ryder, that is, he is not to be given the sacrament. But one of them said, "How, if he repented and reformed? M. Luther answered, "That has its measure; but he must become a Zacchaeus and give back what he has robbed too much from those he has robbed, or he will not repent properly. According to the laws described, he cannot keep it with a right and good conscience, let alone according to divine laws. And whoever eats and drinks with him makes himself partaker of his sins. 


114. question. 


One of them asked M. Luther: If a poor man were in need of money, and had no pledge, would he also take money for his business of advertising? Then he said, "Let him live on his poverty, and feed himself with God and honor; do not sin, nor do wrong, for money is round and perishable, and soon vanishes. So we should not sell the skill of advertising and winning, for it is uncertain. But the people are to be kept to manual labor, and the rich are to be exhorted to works of mercy. 

We do not reject worldly and civil commerce and food, which are just and fair, without avarice and deceit. But we see that the world is not to be reformed, is hopeful and proud, and still boasts of evil deeds and misdeeds. What a jumble is now in Leipzig, which is drowned in avarice. Summa, mundus est diaboli, Genitivi casus, et diaboli, Nominativi casus. The world is of the devil, and the people have become vain devils. 


1) Cf. cap. 21, 8 4, last paragraph. In Férstemann it is called oar. 


In 39, April 13, Luther preached a very harsh and sharp sermon against the avarice of usurers, saying: "They are worthy of all disgrace and cursing and are the greatest enemies of the countries, strangling many people with their shameful avarice and usury. And very beautifully acted the saying of Solomon: "He who has mercy on the poor lends to God on usury," Proverbs 19:17. 


116. from avarice N. N. (Lauterbach, Jan. 9, 1538, p. 5.) 

On the ninth of January, Melanchthon dined with Luther and said much about the cases of the world, which have various influences on the minds of men, and about M. V[itus] W[insheim], who, devoted to avarice, had a very good judgment about good and bad florins. The doctor then said: "If my husband had had such a mind, he would have become very rich. Philip answered, "That is impossible, for a mind that is intent on the common good cannot pursue self- interest. 


117. unfair trade. (Cordatus No. 1316.) 


It is an unequal trade if one has it in his will [to set the price as he wants], the other is in need; for the latter respects the goods according to his liking. 


118. stinginess does not let people use their goods with joy. (Contained in Cap. 3, § 14.) 


Wealth makes people hopeful and stingy. 


Where there is great good, there are also all kinds of sins; for good makes courage, courage makes war, and war brings poverty, poverty brings humility. Therefore the rich will also have to give a great account; for to whom much is commanded, he must calculate much. Wealth, understanding, beauty are fine and beautiful gifts of God, but we misuse them very badly. However, great intellect and a skilful 


234 


A head full of sense is also an evil thing if it turns out badly; for it is said: Qui velit ingenio cedere, nullus erit. No one wants to depart from his mind and head; he wants to be right. It is much better for a man to be a little beautiful under his face, for a disease may come and take it away; but the ingenium, the mind and head, cannot soon be changed. It is written Gen. 3, 5: "You will be like God"; yes, | also mean, we are gods. This disease is innate in us from Adam: You will be like God. 


120. goods the least gifts. 


Wealth is the least thing on earth and the smallest gift that God has given to a man. What is it against God's word? Yes, what is it against bodily gifts, as beauty, health? and against the gifts of the mind, as understanding, art, wisdom? We still strive so diligently for them, and let no work, toil, or danger hinder us or prevent us. One strives day and night to accomplish much and great good, and has no rest; yet materialis, formalis, efficiens et finalis causa, nor is there anything good in it. Therefore, our Lord God commonly gives wealth to gross asses, to whom he does not grant anything else. 


The buyer of a thing shall bear the damage and stand the risk. 


If | sell my field to someone, take a hundred guilders and give five of them; if the Elbe comes and washes it all away, the buyer shall bear the damage, not |. Just as if | sell a horse to someone and hand it over to him; if it dies soon afterwards, the damage is the buyer's, not mine, the seller's. The risk of the goods and the property is his who buys it, he must keep it. Res enim transit cum periculo; qui emit, is eam curet. For the seller no longer owns the goods or has them under his control, but he who bought them from me for a hundred guilders, to him | will give five of them annually at interest, and therefore he must also bear the damage.

122 Positiones und Schlussreden vom Wucher zu Wittenberg disputiret. 


D. M. Luther were brought Pofitiones and Schlussreden vom Wucher, which Ulrich Mordeisen of Leipzig was to disputiren, since he wanted to become Doctor, praesidente D. Doctore Hieronymo Schurff. Then he said: If | wanted to argue, then | wanted to use the argument, namely: Everything that God has permitted - and forbidden, that is good; God, however, has forbidden usury; Ergo, therefore 2c. Then one said: Usury is against nature and natural law, why then did God forbear and permit it? Answered D. M. Luther: "To others, as to the Gentiles, as a punishment, for they, the Jews, do not take usury one from another. Ps. 109, 11. And he said further: "The proofs are very well and precisely put together, | can see that he is poking at me with a word in them; but they please me well, if only the lawyers would also think about them, but no one wants to open their mouths. 

| have often asked D. Hieronymum often asked him to write a book against usury, and he was willing to do so; but where is it? If they also instructed the princes and lords in this way, as they write and teach about it in the school, and said: Most gracious lord, you have the cry, therefore stop it E. F. G., or | will recite my service to you. But this is not de pane lucrando, there is nothing in the kitchen. Then one said: Every man has his infirmity and sin; if one should do that, then one would also often have to show him other vitia, deficiencies and vices. Answered D. Martin: Ei, this is a lame argument and quite unequal, because adultery is not in my hand nor power and do not have, therefore | replace it again and restituire. But with money and property it is another thing, because | have the same in the box. 


123) From one who is willing to lend money usurpingly. 


A great, rich prince and lord, since he was about to die and his soul was on the tip of his tongue, was persuaded by his friends and advisors to make a will that one hundred thousand florins, which he had with him, should be put into trade in Leipzig. 


236 Cap. 4. of the world and its kind. § 123-12b. 237 


This is a beautiful penance, said D. M. Luther. M. Luther; if some were left to die in this way, without sacrament and consolation, the others would be offended by it. So now, unfortunately, it has come to this, that one says: O! good works, my piety does not make me blessed, therefore | will be stingy, proliferate, and do what pleases me and is good for me 2c., and if | am to die, then | will have absolution pronounced. Yes, dear companion, St. Augustine says: God has promised you that he will be merciful to you, but do you also know that he will be merciful to you if you have not wanted his mercy out of spite, in your fresh, young and healthy days? Oh how | would like to preach now, if | were strong. 

Then one said: It would be too hard and unkind, if one should not have the power nor the right to demand the main sum, which he has lent, again according to his opportunity. Likewise, if the pledge would perish from water, fire 2c., that the damage should be the buyer's, not the seller's? Answer: Well, with this one has glossed over the usury and disguised to put the money on interest. If you have money, and a pious poor man comes to you and asks you for it, then lend and help him according to your ability; this is the right of a Christian. One of them said, "Yes, they don't give you anything back? Answer: You have to wait. Therefore a Christian must have the three things: 1. he must give, 2. he must lend, and 3. he must suffer: but the none, or ever so little, is more to be done in the world. 


124. question. (Cordatus No. 970-974.) 


With a clear conscience, he who has set aside a few guilders can say that he has no money to spend when someone asks him to lend. 

Speaking of lending, John [I. Ep. 3, 17.] speaks of the needy brother, and Christ speaks [Luc. 6, 30.] of him that asketh, that is, of the needy, not of an idle man, not of prodigals, who are commonly the greatest beggars, because none of these is helped by lending. 


In this city no one is needy except the students. Poverty is great in the city, laziness even greater. You can't get them to work with money, they all prefer to beg. 

| will not take my wife and children's bread and give it to those who are not helped by it. But one who is truly poor must be helped from the heart. 

Therefore, the passages that speak of alms are not to be interpreted in relation to the idle, for example this [Luc. 3:11]: "He who has two coats, let him give one to him who has none. But by the one coat the Scripture means all the clothing of which the truly needy man has need according to his condition and need, as it calls bread all food. 

The devil tries to make us monks again through almsgiving and to give godless idlers the opportunity to indulge and eat. They all wanted to get rich with me before, there was no end to the begging. 


125. borrow. 


If you lend, you will not get it back. If they give it back to you, it will not happen so soon, and so well and good. But if it does, you lose a good friend. 


126. from the game. 


Cards and dice games are the meanest now, because this world has invented many and various games, it has, truly, well solved. When | was a boy, all games were forbidden, so that the card makers, pipers and minstrels were not allowed to go to the sacrament, and had to confess from playing, dancing and other spectacles and shows, if they had practiced it or watched it and had been there. Now it goes in high pregnancy, and one defends it for exercise of the mind 2c. 

Alas, said D. M. Luther, the world is full of usurers! | would be content to take five, six or even seven of the hundred, because the goods have increased, with a pledge; but so that it can bear such interest, and that the buyer does not have the power to demand the main sum again. Since 


238 


Cap. 4. of the world and its kind. § 126-128. 


239 


But if no pledge is put up, but only money is badly lent 


at interest, and one has to demand the principal sum for a certain time, then it is not right. For money is a barren commodity; it does not bear and raise money again, since it is sown in the same way as grain is sown; | cannot sell it by my skill. Therefore the present dealings with money are unjust and against God, which destroy and drain the land and the people. 

One of them said, "Why don't princes and lords punish such unlawful and unchristian trades and usury? M. Luther answered: What! Kings, princes, and lords have other things to do, they have to panketiren, prangen, hagen 2c., cannot wait for it: therefore it goes and stands also, as long as it can, it must break and a great unpredictable change must follow. But | hope that the last day will soon put an end to it. 


127. from boozing. 


| recently, said D. M. Luther, preached a hard and sharp sermon at court against drinking; but it does not help. Taubenheim and Minkwitz say: It could not be otherwise at court, because the musica and all knightly and string playing would have fallen, only with boozing would now be the worship at courts. And indeed our most gracious lord and prince is a great strong lord, can well stand a good drink, his need makes a 


If he were a drunkard, his lady would not have it good. But when | come to the prince again, | will do no more than ask him to command his subjects and courtiers everywhere, with serious punishment, that they should get drunk. Perhaps, if it were commanded, they would do the contrary; quia nitimur in vetitum, what is forbidden, against it one gladly does. 


The world always wants new things, soon gets tired of one thing. (Cordatus No. 961. 962.) 


The ingratitude and vanity of the world cannot be expressed [in words]. Before the New Testament was translated, everyone wanted it to be translated. When it was translated, they loved it for four weeks and wanted the Old Testament to be translated. This also lasted four weeks and the Psalter also four weeks. The book of Jesus Sirach, 1) which now causes much trouble, will also last four weeks after it is translated, and after that the people will desire something new until they fall into error. 

The book of Jesus Sirach is entirely about the house, so the "Ecclesiastes" is about the world regiment. It is house law and city law. 


1) The book Jesus Sirach was finished in 1533, therefore in this year these words will be spoken. (Wrampelmeyer.)

What idolatry is. 


240 


1. what idolatry is. 


Idolatry is and means all kinds of holiness, worship and spiritual being, glittering from the outside as beautifully and gloriously as it can, plus all kinds of heated and ardent devotion of the heart, of those who want to serve God without Christ, the mediator, without his word and special command. For example, in the papacy, it was considered one of the most spiritual works when the monks sat in their cells and wrote about God and His wonderful works; when they were so fervently inflamed in their great devotion that they lay on their knees, prayed and had their contemplation of heavenly things with such great joy and devotion that they thought they had great joy. Then they cast out all thoughts of women and all that is perishable, thinking only of God and His great wondrous works. All this, which reason considers to be vain angelic spirituality, is still a work of the flesh, as St. Paul clearly indicates when he speaks Gal. 5:19, 20: "But the works of the flesh are manifest, which are adultery, fornication, idolatry, sorcery" 2c. 

Therefore, all kinds of religion (let it have a name and appearance, as great and holy as it may be), since one wants to serve God without His word and command, is nothing else but idolatry. And the holier and more spiritual they seem, the more harmful and poisonous they are; for they lead people away from faith in Christ, and make them rely on their own powers, works, righteousness; as this time of the Anabaptists is also, who want to be far better than others 2c. And of all monks, especially of the Carthusians, order, fasting, praying, hard shirts, the most holy works, rule and whole life, which state, however, was held in the papacy the most holy, are vain carnal works: for they hold that they are holy and become blessed, not through Christ, whom they regard and fear as a strict, wrathful judge, but through their order rules. 

So now no one can persuade the papists that the corner mass is the greatest blasphemy and idolatry on earth, the like of which has been so abominable in Christendom since the beginning of time. 


Cap. 5: Of idolatry. § 1-3. 


241 


The apostles’ time has never been, for they are blinded and hardened. Therefore all _ their understanding and knowledge of God and all divine things is also perverse and wrong, considering that to be the right and greatest worship, which is the greatest and most abominable idolatry. And again, that is idolatry, which is the right and best worship, but to know Christ and believe in him. But we, who believe in Christ and have his mind, can, praise God, know and judge everything, but can be judged by no one with truth, 1 Cor. 2:15. 


2. setting up worship without God's command. 


One of them asked: How can one prove that whoever establishes a church service out of good opinion and devotion, without God's word and command, is lacking the right God and serves a foreign god? He answered: A man honors and calls upon God for this reason, that he turns to Him for comfort, help and all good things. If the same invocation and honor happens according to God's word, that man turns to God for all graces because of his promise and promise made to us in Christ, he honors and calls on the true, living, eternal God. But if he performs a work or service of God out of his own devotion and discretion, in order to appease God's wrath, to obtain forgiveness of sins, eternal life and blessedness, as is the way of all hypocrites and saints of works, then he honors and worships an idol that he himself has invented in his heart, contrary to God's command and commandment, and is an idolater and idolater; and it does not help him to think, | do it in honor of the right God: "For whatsoever is not of faith is sin," Rom. 14, 23. 


3. the nature and character of the idolaters or works saints. (Cordatus No. 887.) 


The idolaters do as the musicians do, for as often as God wants them for His service, He cannot make them do it. Although he preaches to them in his word the way, the time and the place of his service, he does not make them do it. 


242 Cap. 5: On idolatry. § 3-5. 243

Hieronymus Besold, blessed, has diligently written it out), that the holy scripture often remembers Moloch, and that Lyra and the Jews' Commentarii said that it would have been an idol, made of copper and brass, like a man, who would have held his hands in front of him, in which they would have put glowing coals. When the brass image became hot, a father went and sacrificed to the idol, took his own child and placed it in the idol's glowing hands. However, they rang and tolled with bells and cymbals and blew horns so that the parents did not hear the child's cry. Against this all the prophets cried out, especially Jeremiah (Cap./, 31. 19, 5. 32, 35.). And the prophets write that Ahaz sacrificed his son in this way. (2 Kings 16:3) In the 106th Psalm, v. 37, it also says this. All this was done out of the opinion and tradition that they had thought: If | sacrifice to our Lord God, | will sacrifice something delicious to Him; what shall | sacrifice to Him, a calf? | will sacrifice My own son to Him. 


6. Jeroboam's calves, and that cast of the Jews. 


The calves remain in the world forever, until the last day, not that anyone should make and have made for him new calves like those; but in whom a man, putting his trust and confidence in God, makes for him, like Jeroboam, calves, that is, other and strange gods, which he honors and worships instead of the one, right, living and eternal God, who alone can and will counsel and help in all distress. So now all these calves serve, who abandon themselves

on their art, wisdom, strength, holiness, wealth, honor, power, alliance, good fortifications, fortresses, and in sum, on everything, be it what it may, since the world builds on and defies them; for such reliance on perishable creatures is true idolatry and idolatrousness. 


7. idolatry is naturally inherited. (Cordatus No. 1034.) 


We all easily fall into idolatry because we are all idolaters by nature, and since idolatry is innate in us, we like it very much. 


8. from where idolatry initially arose. 


(This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 4. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 151.) 


(9) Apart from Christ, all worship is idolatry. 


(This § is in the great interpretation of the Btief to the Galatians, Cap. 4. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 153.) 


10. idolatry and its punishment. 


Idolatry is called and is, if everything is not done, taught and done according to God's word, as it prescribes and teaches us. For where one wants to serve God, one must consider not what one does and the work, but how it is to be done, whether God has also commanded it, since "God" (as Samuel says 2 Sam. 15, 22.) "is more pleased with the obedience of His word than with the burnt offering. 

Therefore, whoever does not obey God's voice is an idolater, even if he praises the highest and most difficult divine services. For it is the characteristic of idolaters that they do not choose what is easy and small to look at, but what is great and difficult. Such things have been seen in monks, who always and almost daily devise new services; but because God has not commanded it in His word, it is vain idolatry, along with it and always blasphemy, contempt for God's word, avarice, injustice, violence, unjust courts and judgments, and the like. 


246 


Cap. 5: Of idolatry. § 10-12. 


241 





For what men set up for worship without God's word and command is idolatry; as the Scriptures say. 

Therefore, one should flee idolatry with the utmost diligence, as it is not followed by evil punishment, but by final and extreme destruction. For since God punishes the injustice done to one's neighbor with terrible scourges, as is seen in the prophets and histories, how much more severely and cruelly will he punish when he sees that his honor is defiled and oppressed by godless people through idolatry, false doctrine and idolatry? Oh, the punishment will be much greater than a man's heart can think or his tongue can utter. 


11. a different. 


All worship that is performed without God's command is ungodly and idolatry. Although such worship is praised in fathers who had God's command. And from this rule all monasticism and idolatry in the priesthood and elsewhere can be judged and judged. 


12. end of idolatry and idolatrous. 


The life of idolaters is not only arduous, for they do not celebrate or rest, and they get sour, but idolatry is sure to be followed by misfortune and ruin, even if it is blissful in the first place, and receives great goods and power. On the other hand, the right, true, pure religion must suffer hunger and sorrow, be fiercely contested and persecuted. But how the idolaters use such goods can be seen in the papacy, in foundations, at the courts of cardinals and bishops, and it happens with them just as Moses says: "When he was fat and full, he became lustful" 2c. Deut. 31, 20. 

And the secular authorities defend and protect such ungodly beings and abominations; for kings and princes (which the Scriptures call shields Ps. 47:10 because of their office, which they should serve with their power) are commonly patrons of ungodly beings and idolatry. But what will be the end of it? Namely, as Samuel says in 1 Sam. 12, 25: "If you do evil, you will be wronged. 


then both you and your king will be lost." For idolatries, which one performs and does in order to avert God's wrath, provoke God to anger even more. Thus, the papists of today, with their masses, pilgrimages, and invocations to the saints, do nothing but promote their ruin and downfall, and hasten to punish them. For God can suffer nothing less than contempt of His word, which always follows idolatry for and for. From this comes strife and dissension, hatred and enmity of the right pure doctrine, and murder; for the idolaters want to defend their false doctrine and idolatry, not only with insults and blasphemies, but also with their fists. 

Therefore, God is forced on both sides to look into it and to judge, so that the godly are not oppressed, and the idolaters do not go unpunished, because they have deviated from God's word and have created new services, with which the other simple and unintelligent people, as entangled and confused with nets, may not come to the right knowledge of God. Which sin, however, those who are in the teaching and preaching ministry should punish ‘freely and unashamedly, regardless of their high dignity and dignity. For the prophets, as seen in Hosea, chap. 5:1, not only punish the house of Israel in general, but also publicly name the priests in particular; item, the king's house, that is, the king himself and the whole court. They did not ask that there was great danger that the authorities were thus publicly punished and touched, and that they were scorned for it, and that their sermons were reproached as seditious. For another and greater danger pressed upon them, namely, that they saw that by such examples of the authorities the subjects were also seduced and provoked to sin. 

Therefore it is highly necessary to punish the founders and masters or perpetrators of such offenses, especially if they are in high offices, powerful and learned; although it is not without danger. Above all, however, the abuses in the papacy and other errors are to be punished with seriousness, and one is to 


248 


Do not turn to the judgment of the worldly wise nor be deterred, who think that the right pure doctrine could nevertheless be preserved, if one did it carefully and cleanly, that one dealt with it gently and quietly, and for the sake of common peace let the adversaries pass and go a little, see through the fingers, do not lead with the seed bell. No, dear sirs, the danger of arousal is greater, which righteous, faithful teachers and preachers can neither counsel nor control in any other way than to freely and unashamedly punish what they see to be evil and wrong, false and seductive. 


13. beginning of idolatry. 

| hold, said D. M. Luther, that idolatry has its origin and has come from the right religion: that the holy fathers commanded their children and told them to pray early; after that the descendants worshipped the sun early. As then all idolatry commonly has its beginning from imitating the right worship, and wants to embellish itself with a semblance of divine word and the pious examples that have had God's command. . 

(The following paragraph at Cordatus No. 1431.) 

Every idolater is stingy; the work saints [religiosi] are idolaters, therefore stingy. The true righteousness has pity, the false, indignation. Everyone who deals with (his own] righteousness. 1) is sad and safe, and the holier [religiosior ---- scrupulous], the stingier. 


14. from the Astrologia. (Contained in Cap. 70, § 4, last paragraph.) 


The world is full of idolatry. 

All the world (also God's own people, the Jews) has been full of idolatry, for one went there, the other there, worshipping as much as they had mountains and trees in the land, which were pleasant and beautiful; as is seen in the prophets, and we have also done in the papacy. Such was the high idolatry, since they worshipped God with earnestness. 


1) Justitiarius cannot possibly mean "judge" or "judicial officer" here. That would be an idea quite foreign to Luther. 


Cap. 5: On idolatry. § 12-16. 


249 


They sought, sacrificed and fasted, and hurt the body with it. But no one was served by it but the devil and his own thoughts. This then is the greatest dishonor and blasphemy that God encounters in the world, which arises from not knowing Christ; for everything that is apart from and without Christ, be it ever so glorious and great, is nothing but blasphemy and idolatry. 

After that, there is another grosser idolatry, where the great god Mammon, that is, money and goods and the like, is honored and worshipped, since one's heart clings to it and trusts in it. The world is also full of such gross idolatry; for emperors, kings, princes, noblemen, citizens, peasants, go about with the crude block, the shameful mammon, the wretched helper of necessity; everything is attached to it. Thus God is blasphemed and dishonored everywhere, both with the subtle idolatry of hypocrites and great saints, as among the Jews were the Pharisees and Sadducees, and among us are the Carthusians and monks: they worshipped their own righteousness, great merits and holiness, virtues and good works; and with gross idolatry, since most of them despise God and cling to mammon. This is what goes on throughout the world, that people do not honor God, do not ask about Him, do not call upon Him, do not thank Him. 


16. idolatry in the papacy. 


D. Martinus said how in the papacy on the feasts of St. Catherine and other holy martyrs these words and prayers were read and sung: O God, have mercy and be merciful to those who commemorate my memory. God answered: "Come, my beloved, what you have asked, you have received. So this is where idolatry came from. , 

After that they unashamedly taught: The saints can do more than God has commanded them, have more merits than meritlessness. There the saying of St. Paul had to be used to Colossians, Cap. 1, 24, where he says: "Now | rejoice in my suffering, which | suffer for you, and make up in my flesh what is still lacking in afflictions in Christ" 2c. He had to serve them for the 


250 Cap. 5: On idolatry. §16-19. 251 


They did this for their idolatry and for the merit of their other works, which they shared and sold to others. Since St. Peter says 1 Ep. 4, 18: "If the righteous is hardly preserved, where will the ungodly and the sinner remain? Nor did the desperate boys Opera "supererogatio- nis, remaining works, which they did not need, impudently invented. 

That is why the great deception of the devil came with the pilgrimages to Grimmethal, where people were blinded as if they were mad and foolish. Servants, maids, shepherds, women, left their profession in the queue and ran there. It is rightly called Grimmethal, Vallis furoris; there was no one who would have spoken a word against it. The bishop of Wurzburg was silent about it and agreed to it, and because we now speak against it and say that it is wrong and idolatry, we are persecuted to the utmost. If we had had faith in Christ, we could have easily recognized and judged this; but because we have abandoned it, we have fallen into all kinds of darkness. How the good N. in H. and near N. built a chapel for a horse. Well, let us pray and be brave, and keep faithful to God's word. 


17. that Jacob put away foreign gods, and from Cain. (Cordatus No. 1590.) 

Since in the first book of Moses [Cap. 35, 2.] it is read about Jacob that he had removed the foreign gods, one must not think as if he had only removed or broken one or the other idol, but that he had completely changed the false worship. There will have been a being and the true worship has often fallen, as when one reads [Gen. 4, 26.] that Enos began to call on the name of the Lord, because the true worship was violated by Cain, who was an evil-doer; but it should not have been, because by the promise of the Lord 1) [Gen. 4, 15. 


1) In the original erroneously xntris. - The preceding words: "but it should not have been" are either to be understood with Dr. Wrampelmeyer: "he was not predestined for that" or, as it seems to us, it would be better to change "had" into "would have", which fits better into the context. 


If he said, "I'll beat you seven times over," he only got worse, and so he will have been a seemingly fine saint of the world, and he did not want to be ungodly. 


18. idolatry and superstition are common everywhere. (Cordatus No. 945. 2) 

The Turks, the Tartars and all the pagans very often use writings and magic signs to fortify themselves against weapons. This abuse finally reached the Christians, and Maximilian was very superstitious in matters of war. The pagans slaughtered in danger even what was dearest to them. The cause of this is that they know nothing of faith and prayer, which are the advantage of Christians. 


19. warriors have commonly had and used a lot of superstitions in the papacy. (Cordatus No. 946. 947.) 

Not only superstitious, but also foolish was the vow of Jephthah, who killed his daughter after the victory, before which the Holy Spirit came upon him [Judges 11:29]. But God lets His saints be fooled. If a godly man had been there, who would have told him not to kill his daughter, the law would have suffered a mitigation, he [God] would not have meant it that way, he would have saved the daughter, as Jonathan was redeemed [1 Sam. 14, 45.] from the vow of his father Saul. 

The histories of the Old Testament are very glorious, but to us, when we read them, quite dead; but to the believer they live, like the history of Jephthah, which is followed by such great lamentation and lamentation over the virgin for two 3) months, which [lamentation] happens without a doubt [Judges 11:37], because she was to die without children, as can be seen in Hannah [1 Sam. 1]. And for sensible spouses barrenness is something [very] hard, which one easily realizes in the joy we have in our children, who are the sweetest pledge of marriage. 


2) A part of this number was drawn to the following §; however, we let it follow here completely. 3) In the original erroneously "three" months. Cf. 11, 37. 39. 


252 


20. the pagans’ monkey work of the holy of holies and others. 


The Gentiles took it from the Jews and imitated them with the holy of holies, that they had their places and corners, where one asked the idols for advice, where they gave answers; these were also dark and gloomy. But the holy of holies was a dark place in the temple, so that the kingdom of faith is indicated, which cannot be grasped and understood with any reason, but only with faith. In this way the Gentiles also imitated and followed the Jews in slaughtering and sacrificing their children; for it was a good service to God in the sight of reason to slaughter and sacrifice children, as if to say, "If we had something dearer, we would also dare to do it and serve and please God. 


21. the golden calf. 


When the people in the desert, because Moses was on the mountain, set up a golden calf with Aaron the high priest, Exodus 32, they did not want to honor another god or have many gods, 1) but only wanted to change God and His service, beyond what Moses had prescribed and commanded them. Not all, but only the most noble and a part of the people agreed. They wanted to indicate that God wanted to be honored and reconciled by sacrificing calves. 

Such sacrifices were before the law, coming from the fathers and taken. And the worship of the Jewish calf was taken from the Egyptians and was a tradition: they honored an ox and an idol, Apis, just as the people of Israel did, as St. Stephen tells Apost. 7, 41. ff. But this worship of the Egyptians is a tradition of Joseph, who sacrificed oxen and calves. 


22. of the sacrifice of the people. (Lauterbach, July 21, 1538, p. 100.) 


On July 21, there was talk of human sacrifices that were still taking place, which were only

Cap. 5: On idolatry. § 20-24. 


253 


Emperor Carl in our time and erected Minorite monasteries in their place. It was said that at the court of Ferdinand there was a priest's robe of that idolatrous service, which was made of various colored bird feathers, but the sleeves were small, the hands of gold, set with artificially carved and other precious stones. Adorned with this garment, the priest awaits a revelation and then chooses a child or adult to sacrifice with great reverence from the people. Luther said: "It is not to be wondered at that such idolatries are still going on, since in the lifetime of the most holy prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah this idolatry was in bloom among the people of God, against which the prophets fought to the death. For idolatry always has the greatest prestige. 


23. idolatry, which is practiced with monasticism and nunnery. 


There must be sects, said D. Luther. M. Luther, who practice idolatry as long as the world stands, and with the highest devotion give the errors a great appearance and prestige. Just look how much weeping and wailing there was at the blessing when the parents gave their children into the monasteries to be blessed; especially the maidens when they sang the Regnum mundi. Oh! what weeping there was when the parents sacrificed their children to Moloch and burned them. It was a horrible sacrifice in the past, especially when the parents’ natural love and inclination towards the children was great, because they were not blocks and sticks. 


(24) The idolatry of false teachers is for all time. 


D. M. Luther was brought a great book, which a Frenchman, called Wilhelmus Postellus, had written about unity in the world, in which he tried hard to prove the articles of faith from reason and nature, so that he would convert the Turks and the Jews, and bring all people (they would have as many different kinds of worship as they always wanted) to one faith. Then said D. M. Luther said: "It is too much to fast for one bite, although others have fasted before us. 


254 


In the past, the French also wrote books of natural theology, with which they wanted to prove the Christian faith from natural reason. But this one has fared according to the saying: Frenchmen lack brains. There will still come enthusiasts, who will dare to put all kinds of idolatry with a sham and cover on the faith and thereby embellish it. Then Philip Melanchthon said: He had heard of a merchant who had seen in Jndia that they worshipped serpents, and that the people there had honored a large serpent and dragons with the highest worship. 


(25) Of the invocation of the saints, which is also idolatry. 


The question was asked: "Where did the papists originally get the calls of the dead saints? Then spoke D. M. Luther: Perhaps they took it from the pagans, who divided God into innumerable images and idols, and assigned and gave each one its office and work. As they invented and pretended that Pallas was such a goddess, through whom society, peace and friendship among men would be preserved. They did the same with other idols, so that each one had his own humble work. The papists unchristianly imitated them, thus denying God's omnipotence, and each of them had a special opinion apart from God's word, according to his own mind, in the most certain way. 

Just as once there was a sacristan who, when he was to consecrate many hosts over the altar, thought that he had not spoken congruously according to the Grammatica: This is my body; but said: These are my bodies. He then boasted of his art and said, "If | had not been such a good grammarian, | would have committed heresy and consecrated only one host. Such fellows, said D. M. Luther, the world will produce many, that the Grammatici, Dialectici, Rnetores and Philosophi will falsify the holy scripture and make a mixture out of it and their art; since one can highly 


Cap. 5: On idolatry. § 24-27. 


255 


Each should remain in its place, as and for what it is ordered by God, not brew into each other. Theology should be empress, philosophy and other good arts should be its servant; not rule and master it, as Servetus, Campanus and other enthusiasts do. May God preserve His dear Church, which is carried by Him like a child in its mother's womb, and protect it from such scholastic and philosophical theology. 


26. another one of invocation of the deceased saints. (Lauterbach, April 3, 1538, p. 53.) 


The invocation of the saints has been a terrible blindness and a source of money; nevertheless, the papists do not want to turn back. Summa: Even the dead have had to help to strengthen the foundation of the pope, because the invocation of the saints and the satisfaction for the dead have carried everything. The dead have borne much more than the living. Superstition nourishes more than religion; the former is the master, the latter the maid. 1) 


27. of foreign gods. 


Doctor M. Luther was asked: How one could prove that having foreign gods means so much as to establish and establish a worship against God's word? To this he answered and said: Deus et cultus sunt relativa, God and worship belong together, one cannot be without the other. For God must be the God of every man or people, and is always in praedicamento relationis, referring and drawing on one another. God wants to have some who call upon him and honor him; for having a God and honoring him belong together, sunt relativa, as husband and wife in marriage, neither can be without the other. Therefore whoever sets up and establishes a worship service of his own, out of his own devotion, without God's command, is an adulterer and idolatrous, as a wife is when she keeps company with another, and woos him, and again; and seeks one another. 


1) This is immediately followed in the original by Chapter 33, §3. 


256 


God, for the right, true God, even though he thinks he is doing God a righteous service. 


What idolatry is. 


This actually means to commit idolatry: without God's command, out of one's own devotion, to make a

257 


Service to God. For he wants to be unmastered by us, how we should serve him: he wants to teach us and pretend it: his word should be there, it should shine and guide us. Without his word everything is idolatry and vain lies, however devout and beautiful it may be.

1. comparison of the holy trinity. 


In divine things and matters, the Father is the Grammatica, for he gives the words and is the fountain from which flow good, fine, pure words to be spoken. The Son is the Dialectica, for he gives the disposition, how a thing is to be put in fine order one after the other, so that it closes and follows one after the other. The Holy Spirit, however, is the Rhetorica, the speaker, if it is finely presented, blows and drives, makes alive and powerful, so that it presses on and takes the hearts. 


2 There is an image of the Trinity in all creatures. (Cordatus No. 1289. 1290.) 


All that is his, including the Trinity, God has placed in his creature. So he also put the forgiveness of sins against the enemy, the swine, the ox, the woman, etc., which must be spared, just as he himself does. Therefore his epithet is that he alone is. For he alone can have patience with men, but with men is the greatest right, yea, even the greatest wrong. Thus Paul says in Acts, Cap. 13, [18.], "He tolerated their ways." In the sun you find the essence,

Thus every thing has weight, number and measure, but this, which is very good, the scholastics pass over and have devised useless things. 


The article of the Holy Trinity surpasses all reason. 


On the evening when Martin Luther had preached early about the Holy Trinity, he spoke a great deal about this high, excellent article of our Christian faith, which surpasses’ all human reason and understanding, namely, that one is three and three is one; which no arithmetician, philosopher, jurist, Jew or Turk can grasp or understand.

And if the wicked, out of their own thirst and _ iniquity, according to their own reason, want to decide and do something without and against God, then God turns it around immediately, so that it wins the canker: and if he does not, then he loses the honor and glory of his majesty.

264 


1. that Christ is truly God. 


That Christ, the Son of Mary, the virgin, is the true and true God, is testified to in the Holy Scriptures everywhere, but especially in the Evangelist John, Cap. 8, 25, when the Jews were offended at his teaching and asked, "Who then are you? And JEsus said to them: First of all, he who | speak to you," as if to say, "| am your prophet and preacher, according to the saying of Moses, Deut. 18:15: "A prophet like me the Lord your God will raise up for you, from you and your brothers, and you shall obey him. And whosoever shall not hear my words which | put in his mouth, and all that | command him, which he shall speak in my name, of him will | require it." That is: First and foremost hear me, then you will see who | am. | am just the one Moses pointed out. It is a little milder and more polite than if he had said: | am your Messiah. And about this saying St. Augustine struggled fiercely, broke himself and troubled himself. Therefore one should read the dear old fathers and teachers with great distinction and Christian understanding; 1) for they were men just as we are, and have also often erred and erred. 

At another time, D. Martin Luther spoke of the deity of the Lord Christ, saying: "All the sayings in the Holy Scriptures that speak of faith in Christ clearly indicate that he is the true natural God, otherwise it would be idolatry and against the first commandment ("You shall not have other gods") to believe in Christ and worship him if he were not God, for "God does not give his glory to anyone else," Isa. 42:8. 42, 8. Now this article, that Christ is true God, is founded by certain strong testimonies in the Holy Scriptures, especially in the New Testament, since Christ is often called God with clear, expressed words. As Joh. 1, 1.: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with GOD, and GOD was the Word." And Joh. 20, 28. Thomas, the apostle, also calls Christ God, since he says: "My Lord 


1) Cf. Cap. 57, § 11, about the middle, paragraph 6. 


Cap. 7: Of the Lord Christ. § I. 


265 


and my God." The same St. Paul, Rom. 9, 5, speaks of Christ as being God, saying: "He who is God over all, blessed forever." Col. 2, 9: "In Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily," that is, esseniially. 

(Here a section is omitted because contained in the great 

interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 4. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 49 and 50.) 

M. Luther said at another time that Christ is the true natural God. For, he said, if Christ is not God, neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit is God, for our article of faith says that Christ is God with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Many speak of the divinity of Christ, such as the Pope and others like him, but just as the blind man speaks of the color. Therefore, when | hear Christ speak, | believe that the undivided Godhead speaks. Thus speaks the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, when he says Matth. 11, 28: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and | will give you rest. Here the whole Godhead speaks in an undivided and undivided way. Therefore, whoever preaches such a God to me, who did not die for me, | do not accept him as my God. Whoever has this article has the main article of the Christian faith, although this article is very foolish in the eyes of the world. Christ says John 14:16: "The Comforter, whom | will send, shall not depart from you, but shall abide with you," and make you bold to suffer all kinds of misfortunes and evils. Now he says: | will ask the Father; before he said, | will do it. Before he speaks like a god, now like a man. Thus | learn my article, that Christ speaks as God and man. 

Also Christ sometimes speaks as a pure man, and at the same time as a pure God; therefore, when he says: | give, these are not only the words of a man, but of God. But when he says, | will ask; these are the words of a man, and yet the Son of God asks. As when | say, The maid hath dropped the child; | mean not the body of the child only, but also the soul. Item, so 


266 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § I-5. 267 


| say: The child has eaten; so | understand that not only the mouth, but the whole man with body and soul has eaten or fed. In the same way one should also say of Christ. 

Item, D. M. Luther testified from his own experience that Jesus Christ was a true God, he also wanted to confess this publicly; because if Christ was not God, then there would certainly be no God. And said D. Luther: | do not want to become an Epicurean, if God wills it; | know well what the name of Jesus has done to me. It is well said and true that the 68th Psalm, v. 21, sings: "God lays a burden on us, but He also helps us: we have a God who helps, and the Lord our Savior, who saves from death. Therefore, if God wills, no tribulation, misfortune or other creature shall separate me from my Lord Christ. 

Our only comfort is that we believe in Jesus Christ. | have often been so close to death that | knew | would have to die, because | had taught his word before the evil world and had confessed him; but he has always graciously comforted me again and made me alive. Therefore let us be diligent to keep him alone, and there shall be no need, though the devil be yet so wicked and crafty, and the world so evil and false. | will abide with the dear Lord Christ, | will encounter whatever | can: | have been baptized into him, | can and know nothing except what he has taught me. But it is indeed a very great and difficult art, involving many and various trials and experiences, that one can heartily call Christ a Lord and God who saves from death, as the 68th Psalm, v. 21, says; and from this same word and trust | will never, if God wills, let myself be torn away. 


2. whereby Christ's divinity is recognized. 


(The beginning of this § is taken from the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 1. Walch, old edition, Vol. VIII, § 62. 63.) 


3) Believing in Christ is the right religion, 1) 


Although no religion seems more foolish than that of the Christians, | believe in God, since Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the heavenly Father. | do not believe in any other God, as the superstitious and idolaters do, for they are rejected and given a wrong meaning. | D. M. Luther does not want to know about any other God, but only about the one who hung on the cross, namely Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Virgin Mary. 


4. of the humanity of Christ. 


There is a great mystery about the incarnation of Christ, which cannot be explained or investigated by human reason, since God, the highest majesty, has thus lowered himself into our flesh. If we have this Christ, we have everything; for St. Paul to Colossians, in the other chapter, v. 9, says: "In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him. And St. Paul earnestly presents Christ to all men, so that they may believe in him. But there is, alas, nothing more contemptible in the world than the Lord Christ. 


No human being can comprehend the two natures in Christ. 


That Christ is God and man is contrary to all reason, sense, and understanding; for when the two natures in Christ, as the Godhead and humanity, are to be brought into one being, reason is at odds and says, "| do not understand. But thanks be to you for this confession; for it is not written that | should understand and grasp it with my reason, but you must give yourself up, and believe the word of the gospel through the action of the Holy Spirit, and give glory to God that he is true. 

Joh. 16, 23., Matth. 21, 22. and Marc. 11, 24. Christ says: "If you ask anything in my name, | will give it to you. 


1) This § seems to be spurious, only an extension of the same

120.) 


268 


give." There Christ speaks as if he has everything in his hand and power to give everything to everyone what one asks from him in faith. 


6. thoughts of D. M. Luther about the birth of Christ. (Lauterbach, Dec. 25, 1538, p. 195.) 

That evening he was very joyful, and all his speeches, songs and thoughts were about the incarnation of Christ our Savior; and he said with sighing: Alas! We poor people, that we are so cold and lazy about this great joy, which has been done for our benefit, the great good deed, which is far, far above all other works of creation 1); and yet we should believe it so weakly, when it is preached and sung to us by angels, which are heavenly theologians, and have rejoiced so much because of us. Their singing is by far the most beautiful and the main thing of the whole Christian religion. For the Gloria in excelsis Deo [Glory to God in the highest] is the highest service of God, which they desire and bring to us in this Christ. For the world, after the fall of Adam, knows neither God nor the creatures, lives entirely outside of God's glory. Oh how great thoughts man would have had of God in all creatures, so that he would have contemplated God's omnipotence and wisdom even in the smallest flowers. For, truly, who can conceive how God creates from the barren earth: such diverse little flowers, such beautiful colors, such lovely smells, which no painter nor apothecary could make? Nor can God bring green, yellow, red, blue, brown color out of the earth. Adam and his people would have used all this for God's glory and would have used all creatures with thanksgiving, which we now enjoy to our disgust without any knowledge, just as if a cow and unreasonable cattle trampled the very best flowers and lilies only with their feet. Therefore, 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 5-8. 


269 


7. from the feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. 


The feast of the Annunciation, called Annuntiationis Mariae, when the angel came to Mary and brought her the message full of God that she was to conceive his Son, may be called the feast of the Incarnation of Christ. For that is when our redemption began; just as the English and French began to count the year from this feast. For the mystery of the Incarnation of Christ cannot be explained by any human being, nor can it be fathomed by reason, that God, the Supreme Majesty, has lowered Himself into our flesh. For if we have Christ, we have all that our heart desires. That is why in St. Paul the word "in him" is so often used and repeated, since he so vehemently and diligently imagines this Christ in all men; for apart from and without him there is no God, comfort, or blessedness. But, alas, there is nothing in the world that is less esteemed than this incarnation, indeed, it is despised. 

Christ lived three and thirty years, went to Jerusalem three times every year, that is, he went up a hundred times. If the pope could boast that Christ had only been to Rome once, what boast could he make? And yet this city Jerusalem is_ utterly destroyed. 


8. the faithless ingratitude. 


This is a great glory of God, that He put His Son into our flesh and blood, and for our sake made Him human, like us, yet without sin. What a mystery of the greatest miracles and benefits of God is one that no human heart can truly contemplate, for we are so cold and ungrateful. O of corrupt nature! Fie on the shameful fall of Adam, that | should not love this one who has redeemed me so dearly from eternal death, 


here the angels call the people who have fallen back | the devil and hell. 


to faith and love, namely [to the] glory [of God] and [to] peace on earth. 


1) In the original probably erroneously "are". We have put "is" for it according to Bindseil Ill, 43. 


When Doctor Martinus looked at the painted infant Jesus lying in the womb of the pure virgins of Mary, he sighed deeply for the sake of the article of the Incarnation of God, and said: "Ah, that we could have such a glorious 


270 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. §8-11. 271 


If you were to consider the work of divine mercy a little, and not to babble on like that! Fie on you, you disgraceful unbelief, how you stand so shamefully ungrateful against the friendly gracious will of your God, who otherwise wants to stick to all creatures. O Adam's sin! What have you done! 


9. why Christ was born. (Cordatus No. 43.) 

Peter preaches 1) that Christ was born to set all things right, that is, to bring us to self-knowledge, and for this purpose alone the whole creature is placed before our eyes, so that we may contemplate the Creator in it; and this is fortunate for us, because we do not draw much faith from the first article of faith. 


10. of the incarnation of the son of god comforting thoughts of D. M. Luther, according to of the writing. 


On this day (of the conception of Christ), said D. M. Luther, we preachers should diligently hold up to the people the history of the feast, which Lucas describes with poor simple words in a fine and orderly manner with all the circumstances, and well imagine it, and all of us should have joy and delight in the comforting, blessed story that today Christ, our Lord and Savior, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, took human nature in the pure, chaste virgins of Mary, became our brother, has placed us poor stinking maggot sacks and damned human beings in the highest honor, that we are now children of God and his, Christ's, co-heirs, about which we should rejoice more than about all the treasures on earth. 

Here one should not dispute how it happened that he who fills heaven and earth, whom neither heaven nor earth can comprehend, is resolved in the pure mother's body? These and such disputations hinder this joy, and give cause for one to begin to doubt it. That is why | am very annoyed with Erasmum, that he has 


1) Perhaps 3 Petr. 1, 4. Aurifaber has Paul and draws on Eph. 1,4. and Col. 1, 33. 


Doubting things that should be our greatest joy. 

St. Bernard spends the entire sermon of this feast on the praise of the dear Virgin Mary, forgetting the comforting story that, as the Church sings, hodie Deus homo factus est: Today God became man, and the redemption of the human race began. Bernard and Anselmus have done too much to him by exalting and praising Mariam too highly. We Christians should rejoice in the great honor that has been bestowed upon us today, that "the Son of God did not take on the angelic nature, but the seed of Abraha, became like us His brothers, yet without sin," Ebr. 2:16, 17, so that He might become merciful and a faithful high priest before God to atone for our sins. Item: "that by his death he might take away the power of the devil, and deliver us from the power of death. He redeemed us, who through fear of death had to be slaves all our lives. Ebr. 2, 14. 15. 

This unspeakable grace of God, shown to us in Christ, we should consider great and praise. It is true that one cannot sufficiently praise Mary, the high and noble creature; but when the Creator Himself comes and gives Himself for us, that He redeemed us from the power of the devil 2c., neither angels nor we can sufficiently praise, praise, praise for eternity 2c. There we will also have eternal joy and bliss. 


Other thoughts of D. M. Lutheri about the incarnation of the Son of God. 


He who takes reason to counsel will never send himself to know the articles of our faith (especially the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation of Christ), much less believe that they are certain and true. No one can or should be forced to believe by force. For even if people hear something from the holy scriptures or read it themselves and have thoughts, they still do not want to accept it; the majority of them are repelled by it or even throw it to the wind; except for a few who are stirred and opened by the Holy Spirit. 


272 


The Turk keeps his subjects in obedience and coercion by his Mahometan faith and religion (as the pope has done before this time by the ban and human doctrine). He believes that there is one God who created everything. He lets Christ remain a prophet, but that he is the native, true, natural Son of God, he considers this to be the highest blasphemy, for which he has persecuted his word and his people for so long, and he even intends to eradicate it. 

In my great temptations and struggles against the devil, | have learned from the Scriptures and am certain that Christ, true natural God, was also made man. Therefore, | not only believe it, but have also experienced in many ways that this article is certain and true. For in high spiritual temptations nothing has helped me better than that | have comforted myself of it, and have rejected the devil with it, that Christ, the true, eternal Son of God, is our flesh and bones (as Paul Eph. 5, 30. says: "We are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones"), sits at the right hand of God and represents us. If | take hold of this shield of faith, | will soon have chased away the evil one with his fiery arrows. 

God also kept this article strong and firm, protected it against all heretics, Popes and Turks, preserved it in the beginning of Christianity, and afterwards confirmed it with many miraculous signs, so that all who challenged it finally became sinners and disgraced by it. God also allows us to call the Son of Mary His Son and true God and to worship Him. He also hears all those who call upon Him in the name of Christ. Even in this last time of gloom, now some twenty years ago (when the devil, through the end of Christ, the Pope and his followers, attacked us with all his power and cunning), nothing else has preserved us but prayer, sighing and crying out to God our Father in the name of Christ our High Priest. 

Whoever says: | or others, they are called and be whoever they want, have the pure doctrine against the pope, tyrants, Anabaptists, sacramentalists, and other red spirits. 


Cap. 7: Of the Lord Christ. §11. 12.

defended and preserved, he is the one who lies to us. God alone does it for the sake of Christ, who shall reign among his enemies and sit at the right hand of God until they are all made the footstool of his feet. In spite of the devil and all his scales! 


12. of the childhood and youth of Jesus; item, of the knowledge of Jesus Christ our Savior. 


All the wisdom of the world is mere child's work, even foolishness, compared to the knowledge of Christ. For what is more wonderful than to know and to recognize the great ineffable mystery that the Son of God, the eternal Father's image, has taken on human nature and has become like another human being in every way? In Nazareth he will have helped his father Joseph to build houses; for Joseph was a carpenter, therefore also Christ is called the son of a carpenter, even a journeyman carpenter. What will those of Nazareth think on the last day, when they see Christ sitting in divine majesty, and say to him: "Lord, did you not help to build my house? How did you come to have such high honors? 

Many fables are invented by many, what Jesus did in his childhood and youth; 1) as can be seen in the book with the title "De Infantia Salvatoris, oder de Vita Jesu. But because in the same book there are many ridiculous, foolish things, it has never had any reputation among Christians. But this is the most necessary thing that we Christians should learn and know with the greatest diligence, that the Son of the eternal God lowered Himself so low, was born so poor and miserable, and did this for our sins, and hid His majesty from us too well for so long. When he was born, he cried and cried like another child; Mary had to wait for him and take care of him, suckle him (as the church sings: "There was a little milk for his food"), etch, wipe, lift, lay, carry, etc., like another mother her child.

But since we are always preaching this article, and are so diligent to impress it upon the people, and since all Christians daily confess in infantile faith that Christ our Savior suffered under Pontio Pilato, was crucified, and died for our sins, why should we not also say that he was a carpenter? especially since he is thus called in the Gospel in clear words, since the people are astonished at his doctrine and wisdom, and say, "Whence came this to him? Is he not the carpenter, the son of Mary?" Marc. 6, 3.

Therefore | believe that Mary, the mother, not only knew and believed that he was the true, natural Son of God (because she conceived this child miraculously, unusually, namely by the Holy Spirit, and was born without any pain), but that she also saw and noticed this by some signs that he did in his youth. Therefore, whoever wants to understand this child correctly must remember that there is no higher wisdom than to recognize Christ, and not turn away from it or be angry that the world

is a divine power and wisdom for us believers, through which we are saved, and in which even the dear angels take pleasure and delight. 

But the fact that the dear Lord humbled himself so deeply, that he became obedient to the shameful death of the cross, is what he has done for us poor, miserable, damned people for our comfort and salvation. When a great, mighty quay-

ser or king would wash the feet of a despised beggar; dear God, how gloriously would this humility be praised and glorified in such a high person! But because God's Son, the Lord over all, humbled himself to the highest degree and showed obedience even to death on the cross, no one is surprised about it, except the small group of believers who recognize and worship him as their Lord and Savior. 

Therefore | say: To recognize Christ, that he was a man, and so humbled himself, that he became "the most despised and unworthy man, afflicted and beaten by God" 2c., Is. 53, 34. and did this for our sake, that is the right' golden art of the Christians and their highest wisdom. As St. Paul, 1 Cor. 2:2, says: "l know nothing, except JEsum Christ crucified." Nor can the devil be hurt any more or hurt any more, for if one teaches, preaches, sings and says about Jesus and His incarnation, 2c. 

Therefore, | like it very much when one sings loudly and slowly in the church: Et homo factus est; et: 


Verbum caro factum est. The devil cannot hear these words, he must flee from them for many miles, for he well feels what they contain. If we would rejoice so heartily over these words: the Word became flesh or man, as much as the devil is frightened and trembles before it, it would be very good for us. But the world despises all God's works and words, because they are presented to it in such bad, simple words. 

Well, the godly are not deceived by how small and bad the words are, but take heed of the eternal heavenly treasures and goods, which are contained therein, held out to them and offered to them as their own, which are unspeakable, yes, so great and glorious that even the dear angels desire to look at them, 1 Petr. 1, 12. 


No man can unlearn Christ.

271 


For He is true, eternal, almighty God, and yet He took our mortal nature upon Himself and showed the highest obedience and humility even unto death; therefore He Himself says: "| am gentle and humble in heart. Matth. 11, 29. Now | cannot sufficiently explain how | feel when | am quite happy or sad; how then should | explain the high emotions and movements of Christ? 


The name of Jesus alone helps. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1658.) 


This | will leave behind me, that | will consider Christ my Lord alone as my Lord, 1) not only in faith and scripture, but also in experience, for he has proved it in me. For | have the thing [that Christ is my Lord] and the experience [at the same time] with the Scriptures. But, verily, it is become sour unto me. 

And Mr. D. said that spiritual temptation taught what Christ was good for, and that he had sometimes tried it and experienced how powerfully the name of Jesus Christ had helped him, so that no tribulation should drive him away from Christ; the same experience also made him believe that the holy scriptures were certain divine truth. For this experience of his would have made the sayings of Scripture quite certain to him, since the Lord Christ says: "Those you have given me, | have not lost," John 17:12. Item John 6:37: "What comes to me | will not cast out," but this is included so that they do not run away. 


15. that the Lord Christ is our high priest, from the 8th chapter of St. Paul's. to the Romans. 


Christ, our High Priest, has gone to heaven, "sitting at the right hand of the Father, and praying for us without ceasing", Rom. 8, 34. 


1) "will hold" i.e. my faith, my doctrine and firm conviction, confirmed by Scripture and experience, shall be said after my death and certainly held for it, that | will, "Christ alone | hold for my Lord." 


278 


In his death he is a sacrifice paid for our sin, in the resurrection a conqueror, in the ascension a king. In his death he is a sacrifice paid for our sin, in the resurrection a victor, in the ascension a king, in intercession and advocacy a high priest. For in the Law of Moses the High Priest alone went into the Holy of Holies, into Sancta Sanctorum, and interceded for the people. Thus our Lord Christ is finely portrayed in this figure. 


Christ remains priest and king. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 505.) 

Christ wants to remain a priest, although he is not ordained by any bishop. But God has ordained him, saying: You are a priest forever. [The D and the U are longer than the stone in Revelation, 1) 300 miles and more in length. 

In the Holy Scriptures there is no book in which the priesthood of the Lord Christ is so finely and actually described as the Epistle to the Ebrians. Christ's priesthood is a great comfort to the godly, because he is a priest. But that he is also a king is not so comforting, because the heart thinks that he is a strict judge. 


17. Christ is our high priest. 


2) "You are a priest after the order of Melchizedek," says God, the heavenly Father, to Christ, His Son, Ps. 110, 4. Martin said: "Let us cling to this priest and stay with him, for he is faithful and given by God for us, and he loves us more than his own life, John 10:12. He proved this with his bitter suffering and death, which is certainly true. Oh, who could believe this, how blessed he would be! 

(This paragraph follows immediately after Cap. 51, § 6. 

Lauterbach, March 3, 1538, p. 45.) 

Afterwards his servant recited the 110th Psalm: "The Lord has sworn" 2c. He said: "This is the most beautiful, most glorious verse in the whole Psalm, since God has sworn to this Christ alone.

He alone shall be the priest: therefore | swear an oath that he alone shall be, therefore flee to this priest. | mean, the epistle to the Eberians can make it useful, this: You are a priest. 


18. a different. 


There is a great and glorious consolation, which every devout Christian, for the honor and good of the world, should not and would not do without, namely, that he knows and believes that Christ, our High Priest, is seated at the right hand of God, represents and forbids us without ceasing. Item, our souls faithful shepherd and bishop is, which the devil can not snatch from his hands. 

But we can see from this how a cunning and powerful spirit the devil is, that he can frighten and destroy pious, God-fearing hearts with his fiery arrows in such a way that they lose this beautiful consolation and immediately think perverse thoughts about Christ, that he is not their high priest, but accuses them before God; that he is not the bishop of their souls, but a strict judge. Therefore the dear apostles, Peter and Paul, did not warn us so faithfully in vain that we should "be sober and watchful, armed with God's armor to resist the devil, steadfast in the faith", 1 Petr. 5, 8. Eph. 6, 13. 


19. Christ an eternal priest. 


Christ will remain a priest forever 2c., even though he is not ordained by any bishop, because God himself ordained him when he swore, and he will not repent: "You are a priest forever" 2c. In these letters of these words: You are a priest, any syllable is much greater than the tower of Babel. "Rule among your enemies", Ps. 110, 2. Thus ev must and will certainly preserve his teaching, which we preach and confess before the wicked world, even before the gates of hell. We Lutherans (as we are called) and the papists dwell in

the wicked to the righteous. 

The Jews and apostles, together with their listeners, were also under one roof. When the Jews had for a long time plagued the Christians, persecuted them, stoned and murdered many of them, and finally chased them all away, and now thought they were rid of the evil people and the boys, the Romans came and finished them off. The same will happen now: when the papists have raged and raged to blasoheme and condemn Christ's teachings, to persecute Christians and shed their innocent blood, they will have to give way to this part. For Christ will and can never leave those (who hold and confess Him as their eternal King and Priest to the end of the world, preach and confess His doctrine, take comfort in His prayer, John 17, and that He sacrificed Himself for their sin) without comfort and helplessness. 


20. Christ our King and God. 


Whoever has Christ as his King and God, who has taken on human nature, flesh and blood, born of the pure virgin Mary, must certainly take care that he has the devil as his enemy, who will cause him much suffering and torment him all his life. But this is our comfort and great glory, that we poor people have the Lord of life, death and all creatures, clothed with our flesh and blood, sitting at the right hand of the Father, who lives forever and prays for us, protects and shields us.

Joh. 17, 24: "Where | am, there you shall be also”. 


22. Christ stalks as if he does not take care of his poor, afflicted and persecuted members 2c. 


For this reason Christ is incomprehensible in this life, because the world rewards his best and most faithful servants very badly, persecutes, blasphemes, condemns and kills them as the worst, most harmful heretics and evildoers 2c. In addition, he is silent and lets it happen, so that | sometimes think: | almost do not know where | stand, whether | preach right or not. This has also been Saint Paul's trial and torture, which he (I think) has not said to many, or has not been able to say; for who can say what it means that he says 1 Cor. 15, 31: "I die daily"? 


23. the scripture calls Christ our priest, bridegroom 2c. 


The Holy Scripture often calls Christ our priest, bridegroom, bridegroom 2c., and us, who believe in him, his bride, virgin, daughter, which is a beautiful image that we should always have before our eyes. 

Now he proved his priestly office firstly by preaching and proclaiming and revealing to us the will of the Father, that whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, Joh. 3, 16. Secondly, he also prayed for us, yes, for all of Christendom, until the end of the world, shortly before he went to the Father, when he said Joh. 17, 20.1 do not pray for them alone" (to whom | gave your word and commanded to preach), "put also for those who will believe in me through their word"; and still "he sits at the right hand of God and represents and pleads with us before God without ceasing", Rom. 8, 34. Thirdly, that he sacrificed his body on the wood of the cross for our sin. 

He is our bridegroom, we are his bride. What he, the dear Lord Christ, has, even he himself, is ours, for "we are members of his

become. The pope knows nothing of the office of the person of Christ. Macedonius alone challenged the article of the Holy Spirit, but it soon fell and fell to the ground; for if the article of Christ remains, the other soon perishes. 

But all heresy goes against the other article. The son has sinned, he must suffer, they do not want him.

It has been true from the beginning of the world with Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob; and | believe that the devil was also cast into hell because of this, because he was a beautiful creature of God, so he also wanted to be the son. 

According to the holy scriptures, we have no stronger argument than the dear holy cross; for against Christ and the article all kingdoms contend, all that is mighty, and yet cannot overpower him. Therefore, the holy scripture is the first argument to 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 26-30. 


285 


They all come in droves, for they all want to have only One God. But they do not want to suffer the son; just as the devil himself did not want to suffer the son, because he wanted to be a son himself, crying that he was a beautiful creature. Adam also did not want to have the son, he wanted to be as wise as the father himself. There are many figures who, as | think, have indicated this from the devil. Ishmael wanted to be Isaac, and Esau wanted to be Jacob; so the devil was also against the Son of God, that is why it is still the same for us.

Death delivered, "according to the flesh, but made alive according to the Spirit," 1 Petr. 3, 18. Then answered D. M. Luther, and said: All God-fearing and righteous Christians, or the whole holy Christian church and congregation, believe without all doubt that which is spoken of in the infant faith, namely, "that JEsus Christ, the only Son of GOD, in One Divine Being and One Nature with the Father, is truly man. Conceived of Mary of virgins, born of the Holy Spirit, suffered, was crucified, died and was _ buried", therefore they believe that not only the human nature, but also the divine nature, or the right true God, suffered and died for us. 

And although suffering, dying, 2c. are foreign qualities that cannot otherwise be said of the divine nature in particular, but only of the human nature, nevertheless, because the divine nature has thus assumed the human nature and clothed itself in it, these two natures are now inseparable from one another, so that Christ is now in One Person both God and man at the same time: what now befalls and happens to this person, who is Christ, that same thing also befalls and happens to this God and man. Hence it is that these two natures in Christ communicate their idioms and attributes one to the other; that is, what is the peculiar attribute of one nature is also communicated to the other, and is rightly said of it, because they are interdependent, and are alike as interwoven and united, so that they cannot be separated or divided from one another. As, being born, suffering, dying 2c. Idiomata, attributes of human nature, which the divine nature is also made part of in this person, who is and is called Christ, for the sake of the union, which cannot be separated nor set apart from one another, and must be grasped only with faith. 

Therefore not only man, but also God is conceived, born of Mary of virgins, suffers, dies, is buried 2c., as St. Paul testifies Rom. 1, 3. when he says: "Son of God, born of the seed of David, according to the flesh" 2c. He 


Cap. 7: Of the Lord Christ. § 30. 


287 


says: "according to the flesh", because Christ, from David's seed, took on the human nature; therefore it is rightly and actually said that he was born. But because this same nature, in One Person, is so closely united to the divine nature, it almost shares its idiom and quality with the nature of God, as it was born and became man, as John says in Cap. 1, 14: "And the Word became flesh", God became man. Thus, not only man, but also the Son of God, as Paul says, or the right true God was born. And Mary, the virgin, is not only the mother of a man, but a true, real mother of God, as the angel Gabriel testifies, Luc. 1, 31, when he says: "Behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and bear a son, 2c., who shall be called the Son of the Most High." And adds to this, v. 32: "And GOD the LORD will give him the throne of his father David" 2c. Therefore Mary, the virgin, truly gave birth to the true Son of God, who is also the true Son of David. 

But that which has been said and proved of the communication and impartation of one quality of nature (namely, that being born 2c. is also assigned to and said of the divine nature through the communion of qualities), the same is also to be understood of the communication and impartation of the other qualities, such as suffering, dying, being buried 2c, although they are actually due to and belong to human nature; yet the divine nature in Christ subordinates itself to these and suffers 2c., also according to the saying of Paul, Rom. 8, 29: "We must be conformed to the image of the Son of Goad" 2c. Item, v. 32: "Who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us" 2c. And in the first epistle to the Corinthians, Cap. 2, v. 8: "For if they had known the glory, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." Item, to Philippians, Cap. 2, 6, 7, 8: "Jesus Christ, though he was in the form of God, for he was like God; yet he took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of another man, and in his deeds was found in the likeness of men, and humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even death. 


288 


on the cross." Likewise, the Church sings: Vita in lign moritur: Das Leben stirbet am Holz 2c. 

Therefore, one should certainly believe tha everything that is actually due and happens to huma nature in Christ is also communicated, assigned an given to divine nature. So that it is rightly and truly said God is born, nursed or suckled, lies in the manger freezes, walks, stands, falls, wanders, wakes, eats drinks, suffers, dies 2c. 

There is also a beautiful, excellent saying to th Eberians, Cap. | will only refer to it in this piece,’ sinc it speaks thus, v. 7: "You have made him lack a littl time of angels 1)". And soon after, v. 9: "But the on who lacked a little time of angels, we see that it i Jesus, through the suffering of death"; but he says: " little time", that is, until he had tasted death. Wha could be more clearly said? "He is," saith he, "becom lower than the angels." Why? "Because of the pains o death," for he has tasted death; therefore he ha become somewhat lower than the angels, whos nature is not subject to death, for they do not die. Bu he, because he is a lord and creator of the angels an natural God, for he is the Son of God, nevertheless h humbles himself and dies. 

On the other hand, it should also be known tha idioms, attributes of the divine nature in Christ ar rightly shared with and given to the human nature because it is connected and united with the divin nature without any separation, they are rightl communicated and given to it. Therefore Christ say: John 3:13: "No man leadeth unto heaven, but he tha is from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven" and yet he standeth and walketh here on earth, an speaketh with Nicodemus. Therefore it is seen tha what is appropriated and given to Christ, or to huma nature in Christ, is rightly and properly due to man. 


1) Aurifaber's marginal gloss: lack, says D. M. Luther there. | the Ebraisch this verse reads thus: You let him lack a little time o' God; that is: You left him three days of his suffering, as if no Go was with him; but where there is no God, there is also no angel. 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 30. 


289 


given to the divine. Item, he says Matth. 18, 19: "Where two or three are gathered in my name, 2) there am | in the midst of them". In these sayings he certainly speaks of his personal presence, that in this person, who is and is called Christ, there must also be both man and God at the same time, or both natures together, undivided, present everywhere, and in truth, hear, create and work all things in all, as the 8th Psalm, v. 7, says: "You have put it all under his feet" 2c. So, where one nature is, there must also be the other, and none can ever be separated or separated from the other in eternity. 

But since no human heart or reason can understand, comprehend, or investigate such things by its understanding and wisdom, it should be accepted with faith and believed to be true, because God says so in His Word. If we do this, then we will understand and feel (as devout Christians and godly people who have experienced these things testify) what comfort this article gives in all troubles and temptations of sin and death. Item, we will learn what light it brings to understand the Scriptures; yes, since this article is not understood, it can be seen, yes, it is certain that in this history of the suffering of Christ everything is cold and in vain, and one understands nothing of it, although one chats about it a lot. 

And from this it can be understood that Peter says 1. ep. 3, 8.: "Christ was killed according to the flesh" 2c. that the divine nature is not excluded, but was made a part of suffering and dying. For he says: According to the flesh he was given in death. Although suffering and death are proper and are the nature and characteristic of human and mortal nature, he nevertheless says that Christ died, who is both true God and true man. Therefore God and man died. About that, who knows this and understands it.

To be lords of all things like Christ, but so that he may remain the firstborn among many brethren. 

Therefore a Christian who believes this looks at the sun and everything we need in this world as if they were not there, but always remembers the life to come, in which he is all ready, even though it does not yet appear, even "all creatures wait for the redemption and revelation of the children of God", Rom. 8, 19. 

All creatures have been eliminated, and all works, no matter how holy they are, have been purely excluded and cut off as necessary for salvation. Since a work makes blessed, so also apples and pears make blessed. Christian righteousness is not such a righteousness as is in us and clings, as otherwise a qualitas and virtue, that is, which is found in us, or which we feel; but is an alien righteousness, altogether apart from us, namely, Christ Himself is our formalis Justitia, perfect righteousness, and the whole being, | Cor. 1, 30. 


34. suffering of Christ and His Church, and how Christ nullifies the power of the devil. 


Is it not a strange thing that the Son of God should sit there and be so miserably mangled, mocked and ridiculed? whom all angels worship, before whom the earth trembles, whom all creatures recognize as their Creator, they spit in his face, strike him on the mouth with a reed, say: "He is a king, he must have a crown and a scepter," Matth. 27, 30, 31, 32. 27, 30. 31. 32. The Lord Christ does not complain about this in vain in the Psalm: "All my bones have been cut in two," Ps. 22, 15. So they have stretched him. 

Oh, it is nothing with our suffering: when | look at our suffering, someone would be ashamed to death. We are still to be conformed to the image of the Son of God, and even if we become conformed, it is still nothing. He is the Son of God, we are poor creatures: if we suffer eternal death, it is nothing. 

There you can see how the devil has a fury against the Son of God and the human race. Once | saw a wolf tearing a sheep; ei, how goes 


he will kill them! Jtem, 1) When he enters the sheepfold, he does not feed any of them, for he has first slain them all; then he starts and feeds, thinking that he will devour them all. So the devil also thinks: | have now caught Christ, | will also get his apostles by and by; but he does not see that he is the Son of God, and that is also the devil's foolishness, he does not know that after this he should feel so bad, and that he should be paid so badly. 

After this the devil is destroyed, so that he must be afraid of a young child in the cradle: for where he only hears Jesus called by a true faith, there he cannot stay; for he remembers: | have strangled this one. Just as if H[ein] Mordbrenner 2) were to come to a place where the Elector of Saxony was, and he found out about it, he would flee and not expect the Elector, for he knows that he has burned him. So also the devil must be afraid of Christ: he would run through a fire before he would stay. This means: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head," Genesis 3:15. | mean, he bruised his head so that he could neither hear nor see the Christ. 

| have often liked the parable in Job about a fishing rod that fishermen cast into the water and put an earthworm on it; then the fish come and want to eat from it, so they eat the iron with the earthworm, and the fisherman pulls the fish out of the water. Our Lord God did the same to the devil: he cast his only begotten Son, the Lord Christ Jesus, as a fishing rod into the world, and put the humanity of Christ as an earthworm on it: so the devil snatches at the man Christ and strangles him, and bites into the iron, into the divinity of Christ; snap! there he and all his power lie on the ground. This is the divine wisdom, that he lets his feet, that is, his Christians, be tortured in the race and be humiliated: then the devil thinks he has it all in his power, but he is still far short.

Collation of the suffering of Christ with the suffering of His Church. 


Doctor Luther says that the work of the young theologians should be that they confer the suffering of Christ with the suffering of the Christian church, and said: Christ did not say the words in vain on the cross: Consummatum est, thatis, all is accomplished; for now it is so, Christ's suffering is fulfilled in his church. For first of all they crowned him and mocked him, when the pope wrote himself King of kings and Lord of lords. Then they crucified him with the monastic vows. After that there is an earthquake, and the sun loses its light. The Pabst's regiment has lost its light, both its eyes are pierced out. Item, the rocks are torn apart, that is, many hard heads are now coming to the gospel, who never wanted it. Now it will be said: "Into your hands | commend my spirit. It rhymes very well; for what the man, the Son of God, speaks or does is a great thing, at which all angels must marvel, yes, the earth trembles at it. 


To what time and hour Christ gave the paschal lamb. 


According to the Law of Moses, Christ began to eat the paschal lamb with his disciples on Green Thursday evening, when the day began at seven o'clock. After that he instituted the new paschal lamb. And when he had washed the disciples' feet, he went out into the garden: there he was caught about the eighth hour of the night, for such a great and heavy struggle could not last long. 

He was led first to Annas, then to Caiphas, when Peter denied him three times before the cock crowed, from nine to twelve. During those hours, until early in the morning, when it began to be day, the Jews plagued, mocked, and spat on the Lord Christ. 

In the morning at the earliest the chief priests held council, and heard Christ. After that, when it was day, that is, 


About the sixth hour they brought Jesus to Pilate, where they accused him of being crucified and spent almost three hours on it, so that it was almost nine before Christ was crucified. 

And this is what St. Marcus says Cap. 15, 25: "They crucified Jesus at the third hour", that is, it was not yet at six. And St. John, Cap. 19, 14, because it was nearer to six than to three, therefore he writes: Christ was crucified at six, that is, according to our pointer, from nine the Jews pressed in Pilate for Jesus to be crucified, and they hardly attained it at twelve. And at twelve, when he had hung on the cross awhile, darkness fell: and at last at nine, that is, about three in the evening, he gave up his spirit with a great cry. "And because it was the preparation day," he says in v. 31, "the Jews hastened that the dead bodies might be taken down from the cross," that is, that Christ lay in the grave the fourth part of the Jews' Easter day; and that is one day. The other day began on Friday, after the sun had set, and lasted all night until the sun set again on the Sabbath day. All this time Christ lay in the grave. But on the Sabbath day, after the setting of the sun, the third day, which the Jews call the Sabbath day, is observed, according to the Jewish way, which is the day closest to the Sabbath at Easter. On the same Sunday morning, when it was light on the same third day, and the sun went out, Christ our Savior rose again from death. And this is what we confess, believe and say in our faith: Risen on the third day, do not say after three days, but on the third day. 


37. Christ's friendly conversation in the Lord's Supper. (Lauterbach, April 11, 1538, p. 61.) 

Afterwards he remembered the meal of Christ and the apostles at the last supper, where the Son of God speaks to His own in the most intimate way and bears their weakness.

43. of Christ's sufferings, which most grieved him, and still do, the Jews. and pagans. (Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, p. 79.) 


On the evening of May 12, Luther spoke of the greatness of Christ's suffering; because he was completely innocent, he would have been justified in saying, "The prince of this world has nothing on me" (John 14:30), and yet he suffered most grievously and was most shamefully mangled for the sake of our sins. The Jews crucified him by word, the Gentiles by deed. The suffering of Christ is a tremendous prophecy of the wickedness of the Gentiles, for Christ suffers more today in the church of the Gentiles than in the synagogue of the Jews. More bitter is the blasphemy, the contempt, the tyranny, than once among the Jews. For if one confesses in Italy the article of faith and of the last judgment, the pope says: Why do you believe this? Be of good cheer. 1) This and similar blasphemies have not only been spoken by apope, but it is a common speech in all Italy, which elsewhere no man could utter with impunity. 


44, of Christ's future. 


(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, June 14, 1538, p. 89 f.) 

The prophets have summed up the [twofold] future of Christ. As we know that the last day will be, and yet we do not know what will happen after the last day, except that we know in general that there will be joy and eternal peace of heart: so the prophets know the future of Christ, and yet they did not know what would be after the coming of the Messiah, not other than in general. So also the prophets thought that immediately after the coming of the Messiah the last day would come. To- 


1) Fac tibi bonum vultum: put on a friendly face. 


. § 42-16. 299 first, because they call the time of the Messiah the last time. Secondly, because they have summarized the signs of the first and the second future as if they would occur at the same time. Thirdly, this is also the reason for Paul's question in the [first] Epistle to the Corinthians: whether the day of judgment will come while they are still alive. Fourthly, so does Christ himself, who gives [both] signs at the same time. (This paragraph in Lauterbach, Sept. 12, 1538, p. 131.) Augustine's saying is very, godly, because he says: Christ has put his single in harmony with our double, and so it makes a perfect number. For Christ's death is called the simple, because he dies only according to the flesh; but our death is the double, because we would be eternally damned according to body and soul because of our sins. 


(The first four lines of the last paragraph in Walch are transferred to Cap. 24, § 75, where they belong). 


45 Christ preached from a book. (Lauterbach, Oct. 11, 1538, p. 147.) 

After that it was said that D. Jakob Schenk did not preach from a book. He [Luther] said: | do it not for necessity's sake, but as an example to others, and no one may be ashamed of the book in the pulpit, because Christ, the high Master, Luc. 4, [17] has left us the example of preaching from the book. 


46. Christ has gone to hell. 

When the article "descended into hell" was mentioned in our Christian faith, D. Martin said: "This is my simple opinion, and | believe that Christ went to hell for us, to break and destroy it; as is proved in the 16th Psalm, v. 8 ff, and Acts 2:24 ff. 2, 24. ff. is proven. Although foolish and quarrelsome spirits and clever ones might take cause to dispute, and pretend that the word infernus, hell, is taken and understood for a grave, as it is written several times in the first book of Moses about the creation. But here the Ebrew word nobet, which is pit, is not written; but scholah, which is Gehenna, hell. For the ancients made four different kinds of hell. 


300 


47. bon Christ's resurrection. 


Anno 30, April 9, Martin spoke of the resurrection of the Lord Christ through the Word and the preaching of the Gospel, which does not happen without earthquakes, just as Christ was wiped out of the grave and resurrected with a great earthquake. Even today the world is still stirring. And a tumult arises when Christ's righteousness and holiness alone are preached and proclaimed. But such an earthquake is salutary, comforting and fun for the God-fearing and true Christians, and more to be desired and desired than peace and rest against God, with an evil conscience. 

The Jews let them dream and thought that Christ's kingdom would be a worldly kingdom; as also the apostles, Joh. 14, 22.: "Lord, what will it become that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?" We meant that the whole world should see thy glory, that thou shouldest be emperor, and we twelve kings, among whom the kingdoms should be divided, that every one should have among him six disciples for rulers, earls, and lords; which would be the two and seventy disciples, for so many were they. Thus the dear apostles had already divided the land according to Platonic delusion and human reason. But Christ describes his kingdom much differently, as follows v. 24: "He who loves me will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" 2c.

all creatures in heaven, on earth and in hell. But whoever wants to have him as Lord will have the devil as his enemy and adversary. 


(51) Whether they were right who said and spread the miraculous signs of the Lord Christ, when he had forbidden them. 


To this the Doctor answered: When Christ speaks outside of His office, He speaks as a God, as when He speaks of His person, and says Joh. 16, 15: "All that is of the Father is Mine"; Joh. 14, 1: "If you believe in God, believe also in Me" 2c. But when he speaks according to his office, as sent by the Father, he speaks as a man and servant, not of his person, as when he says Matth. 20, 28: "| have come to serve" 2c. So also here, when he is about to perform his miraculous works, he speaks as if sent by the Father. And he is well pleased to reveal it, so that he may give us an example and a lesson that we should not seek our glory in what we do good, but only in God. Therefore John testifies in his entire gospel that Christ honored the Father, not himself; this is what he made us preachers believe. So also is that of his ministry, when he says: The Son does not know about the hour. 


After his resurrection, Christ revealed to the apostles everything that had happened to him during his suffering. 


This is what D. Martin said to someone who asked him and wondered how the evangelists could have written about things they had not known and could not have known or remembered. When they wrote: Christ woke up the three disciples who were sleeping in the garden. They also wrote that the angel appeared to Christ, spoke to him, and comforted him. Likewise the words of Christ when he prayed, which they had not heard. Item, what happened during the night in Caiphas' and Herodis' house, which they neither saw nor heard, because they had fled. 


302 


53. Christ's humility and kindness, (Cordatus No. 1638.) 

It is certain that Christ had the sweetest intercourse with the apostles, served them at table 2c. In the end, the good people were accustomed to this and let it happen. He came to serve. This they granted him. The example is set high for us. 


Christ leads his kingdom wonderfully. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 85, last paragraph.) 


55. crucifix of Christ. (Contained in Cap. 30, § 32.) 


56: One should believe in Jesus Christ alone. 1) (Cordatus No. 210 and No. 211. Anno 1531.) 

There is no stronger argument against the Jews than the seat of David, because they have not had dominion for 1531 years now. There is nothing else that presses them harder than the seat of David. And Pauli's arguments against the Jews are not a joke. Although no religion is so foolish in the sight of reason as the Christian religion, | believe in one Jew, who is called Jesus Christ; | do not believe in others, for the Jews have been rejected and given a wrong meaning. 

2) In every way, he who stands in the holy place, preaches in the pulpit and in public, should teach. And itis much better for one to lack rhetoric than dialectics, which teaches; but rhetorics, with its eloquence alone, adorns the doctrine that one teaches. The color is rhetorica, the crossing out dialectica. If we cannot have color against the pope, we can still design.

61) Which people will benefit from Christ. 

The fact that Christ came and became man does not help the hypocrites, who live and are secure without fear of God; nor does it benefit those who are obviously godless despisers: likewise the despairers, who think that there is no consolation. Grace to wait on, when the law has frightened them. But to those alone it is of use and comfort who have been troubled and frightened by the law for a while, and yet do not despair in such serious and heartfelt terror of the law, but come with comforting confidence to Christ, the throne of grace, who "redeemed them from the curse of the law, when he himself became a curse for them," Gal. 3:13. Those who do this attain mercy and find grace. 


62. Christ must remain eternally, and all who believe in him. (Cordatus No. 413.) 

There is talk of future persecution. But we know from the second Psalm: Christ they must let live, and though we die, we are not dead; but if Christ dies, | also die. But | take comfort in the fact that God's word, which endures forever, says: "I live, and you also shall live" [John 14:19]. | have been baptized into Him, therefore | know of none but Christ.

men And only the echo resounds again. Thus we preach to the glory of God, although no fruits follow. And although many' blaspheme, yet it is good to preach Christ for the sake of less. 


He who knows Christ well is a master of the Scriptures. 


Cabbala was good until Christ; therefore, because Christ has now come and the grave is open, it is all over. But our red spirits say that there are still many things hidden in the holy scriptures that have not yet been revealed. This is false and not true, for the grave

68. Christ often revealed Himself to His disciples after His resurrection from the dead. (Cordatus No. 436.) 

As often as Christ sat and ate with the apostles after his resurrection, so that they could feel that the divine majesty was sitting with them and dwelling in him bodily, they often had to think: How we have held on to Christ like peelers and evil-doers, because it is said of Peter [John 21:17] that he became sad. Therefore what he says [Joh. 16, 22] had to happen: "| will see you again" 2c. If he had not done this, he 


is open and Christ has come forth. Therefore he that] would never have brought the apostles to him. 


knoweth Christ, and knoweth him aright, is a magister in the scriptures, and shall remain a magister. 


65 You should never be afraid of Christo. (Contained in Cap. 2, §155.) 


The dead Christ is not forgotten. 

Many a dead person has been forgotten, can we not also forget the dead Christ? said a Jew once; which is a devilish speech. Yes, dear devil, it is called Sheflimini, that is: Sit at my right hand. Therefore Christ, his suffering and death must be preached in the world as it stands. 


67 Christ wars with great lords. (Cordatus No. 513.) 


Where Christ abides, there also abide those who believe in him. (Cordatus No. 438.) 

If we were not baptized, if we did not believe in Christ, the devil would leave us alone. But we will hold fast to Christ, no matter how much the devil may be angry with us. Where Christ abides, we will abide; if he goes to hell, we will go with him. 


70. a different. (Cordatus No. 440.) We have more opportunities for joy than for sadness, because we believe in the living God, and Christ lives and we should also live [John 14:19]. But

75 St. Paul's person. 


Then Magister Veit Dieterich asked him, saying, "What kind of person do you think Paul was, Doctor? Then the doctor said, "I think Paul was a despised person who had no reputation; a poor, scrawny little man, like Master Philip. 


The Christian's golden art is to know Christ rightly. Psalm 51, v. 8, it is written: "Behold, thou delightest in the truth that is in secret: thou hast made me to know the secret wisdom. This is a secret hidden from the world, and will remain hidden: 


1) Cf. cap. 24, § 101, para. 1. 


the truth that is hidden, and the secret wisdom; not of the lawyers, physicians, philosophers and the wise men of this world: no, but your wisdom you have made me know. This is the golden art that Sadoletus cannot do, although he writes a lot about this psalm. 

Of this art, which the world's wisdom regards as foolishness, even as nothing, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 1, v. 18 ff: "For the word of the cross is foolishness to them that perish: but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written (Isa. 29:14), "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise" (that is, it will be nothing and come to nothing) "and | will reject the understanding of the wise. (Isa. 33:18.:) "Where are the wise? Where are the scribes? Where are the worldly wise? Has not God made the wisdom of this world foolishness? Because the world through its wisdom did not recognize God in His wisdom, it pleased God to make blessed those who believe in it through foolish preaching 2c. Because the Jews ask for signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified, a vexation to the Jews anda folly to the Greeks. But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ, divine power and divine wisdom. For divine foolishness is wiser than men are, and divine weakness is stronger than men are 2c. For Christ Jesus was made unto us of God wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that" (as it is written Jer. 9:24.) "whosoever shall boast, let him boast of the LORD.” 

Erasmus, Sadoletus, the papists, Walen 2c. see that | abolish the error of the rabble and the common man. This is not to be suffered by them; for they hold that one should never follow the people, and for the sake of common peace one should always believe what the people believe. Although the faith of the people is nothing at all, and no faith to be respected, for it is certain that they think nothing of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. But he who has started the game loves the truth, therefore he will 


308 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 76-80. 309 


be the enemy of lies. Therefore, the boys will have to go to the ground. Whether we have to put something on it for the sake of Christ, let it always go. For "God's judgment begins at the house of God," 1 Pet. 4:17; we must be the first, but they must follow, and after that no end; so they shall know. 


To know Christ surpasses everything that is on earth. 


You should not take the whole world for it’, said D. M. Luther. M. Luther, that you know that Christ is Christ, that is, our only Savior, High Priest, King and Lord, whom | did not recognize for a long time in my monastic life. Since we are already dying, Christ still lives; if he lives, we also want to live for sure. For this saying stands firm and certain, and will also remain true forever against all hellish gates, since it says John 14:19: "I live, and you also shall live. Now Christ, whom we preach, is God, therefore the whole world is nothing against this Christ. 


78. a different. 


All the wise men of the world mock and ridicule us Christians for leading and carrying on the cause of the Lord Christ with such earnestness; but it shall surely fall upon their bosoms at the last day. 


(Here 6 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 1, § 5.) 


And if | would only leave behind me the fact that | now practice and teach with the highest diligence that one should beware of speculation, and take hold of Christ alone in the most simple and certain way, then | would have done and accomplished much. 


79. teaching of Christ and the apostles. 


When one said that St. Paul had taught many things more clearly and distinctly than Christ, M. Luther replied: "If this saying in Paul, Rom. 5:12, were not written: 'Sin came into the world through a man, and death through sin, and reigns also over those who have not sinned as Adam did,’ then one could hardly say, 'l have sinned. 


The first two words of the Bible, "original sin" and "original sin", are the same as the first two words of the Scriptures. 

He further said that after his resurrection, when he sent the Holy Spirit, the preaching of Christ went out into all the world, resounded and penetrated mightily. As he commanded the disciples shortly before he ascended to heaven, Marc. 16, 15: "Go into all the world" 2c. Item Joh. 16, 7. Cap. 14, 26.: "It is good for you that | go, for the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will teach you all things and remind you of all that | have said to you. He will guide you into all truth." This Master, the Holy Spirit, sooke and worked through the apostles, and presented the doctrine of Christ more clearly, so that their preaching penetrated powerfully and produced more fruit than when Christ preached. As he himself had previously proclaimed, "He that believeth on me, the works that | do shall he do also, and shall do greater works than these." Joh. 14, 12. Item, when he said Matth. 28, 19.: "Go, teach all nations, and baptize them in the name" 2c. This is said: My people, the Jews, to whom | am promised, have not wanted nor can they hear my preaching ina small corner (in Judea) of the world. Now all nations in all the world shall and must hear your preaching. This and no other: "For all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, and | will be with you to the end of the age", Matth. 28, 18. 20. 

But | think that Christ preached gently and carefully, not wanting to penetrate with power (as he could have done, because he preached so powerfully that the people were astonished at his teaching), for the sake of the fathers to whom he was promised, so that circumcision and the law, together with the divine service, might be done away with and abolished in silence, with honor and patience on the part of those who thought highly of the fathers. 


80. Christ preached in vain. (Cordatus No. 435.) 


Christ preached in vain and yet had the pious women given to him [Luc. 8, 3.], and yet once coined, Matth. 17, [27.] for need or out of poverty. 


310 


81. Christ once coined. 


(Contained in the previous §.) 


82) That John calls Christ the Word. 


He wanted to show that Christ is the person who spoke to the fathers at all times, Is. 7. Behold, | myself, who spoke, am now present; and Joh. 1, 1.7.: "No one has ever seen God, but the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has proclaimed it to us. Do you now want to know who is the one who has spoken to his believers in all ways? "The Word," says St. John, "which was in the beginning before the creation of all creatures, by which all things were made." 


The prophecies of Christ are described with dark words. 1) 


The prophecies that God's Son should take on human nature are so obscurely described that | think the devil did not know that Christ should have been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Therefore he says to Christ in the wilderness, when he tempted him, Matth. 4, 6.: "Are you the Son of God?" Call him the Son of God, not because he thought that he was the Son of God in kind and nature; but according to the scriptural way, which also calls men the children of God, Psalm 82:6: "You are all the children of God." 

This is why such prophecies about Christ, his suffering, resurrection and kingdom were not revealed before the time of his future (except to the prophets and other highly enlightened people), because everything was saved and directed to Christ, who was the only right master to open the understanding of the Scriptures. Therefore Moses commanded his people Deut. 18, 19: "You shall obey him"; and God the Father says Matth. 17, 5: "This is my beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased; him you shall hear." 


1) The first lines of this § were used in the old edition for an entry of Cap. 24, § 63, which was then followed by a section from the Church Postilla. 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 81-84. 


311 


That Peter and the other apostles (as can be seen in the apostles’ stories) do not call Christ God in their sermons in clear words, is because they did not want to anger the pious Jews, who were still weak in faith, nor give them cause to avoid and persecute their sermons, and thus fast a suspicion against them, as if they wanted to proclaim a new God, and reject the old true God of their fathers and now no longer accept him. Nevertheless, they draw on, and remember with clear distinct words, the ministry of Christ and his works, that he is a prince of life. Raises the dead, justifies and forgives sin, answers prayer, enlightens and comforts hearts 2c. So that they may sufficiently indicate and confess that he is true God; for no creature can do these works, but God alone. 

Sometimes the apostles use dark sayings about the divinity of Christ, as 1 Cor. 10, 4: "They were drunk with the spiritual rock that followed with them, which was Christ." Item v. 9: "Let us not tempt Christ." By these words Paul proves that the Son of God existed before, that is, from eternity before He took on human nature, He has always presided over His church, enlightened it, governed it, protected it, strengthened it and preserved it against the power of the devil and the evil world. Thus, John 8:58, Christ Himself says: "Before Abraham was, | am," clearly indicating that He existed before He became man. 


Christ's kingdom will be wonderfully built and preserved. 


Our Lord Christ rules and _ preserves his Christianity wonderfully, not by human wisdom and power, like worldly kings, princes, etc., yes, he hides his divine wisdom, power and strength, so that they are nowhere to be felt nor seen, and he is foolish to speak according to reason, to build and preserve his kingdom. 

He also has servants and officials, 2 Cor. 5:18, 20, whom he sends out into all the world, not armed with weapons of the flesh, but commanded. 


Z12 


preaching his word to them, enlightens and strengthens them with the Holy Spirit. They do nothing but preach the word. In this way Christ destroys the devil's kingdom and builds him a church that the gates of hell cannot overcome, Matth. 16, 18. As the 8th Psalm, v. 3, sings: "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have given a power or kingdom. So put to shame great potentates, kings, princes, 2c., the pope, who now also cannot continue with their religion, power and wisdom, who dare to destroy his word and people, Jer. 1, 18. 19. Therefore they finally go to ruin over it, as the said Psalm sings further: "Thou hast prepared such power for the sake of thine enemies, that thou destroyest the enemy and the avenger." 

But a strong faith belongs to it, which keeps to the word, and does not allow to err nor to be annoyed that the great leaders on earth are against this teaching, call it heresy, and persecute it as the worst and most harmful people, who spread it, accept it and confess it. But they do not know (although, unfortunately, many now deliberately persecute and blaspheme the recognized divine truth), "that they rebel and counsel against the Lord and His anointed", Ps. 2, 2, yes, "they think they are doing God a service by it", Joh. 16, 2. 


85. word of Christ Matth. 11. 


It is frightening to the world, and annoying and mocking to all worldly wise men, that Christ says Matth. 11, 25: "I praise you, Father and Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to babes" 2c. But it is very comforting for us Christians, whom the Lord has bound together with a strong and firm bond, so that we are one body, have one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and one Father, Eph. 4:4, 5, 6. Therefore Christ's kingdom alone is directed to destroy the works of the devil and to justify and save sinners (not the worldly wise, righteous 2c.) who feel their misery and sorrow and desire his grace and help from the bottom of their hearts. For this they will bring him into the 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 84-86. 


Z1Z 


praise and preach his word, and confess and spread it before the wicked, ungodly world, that his kingdom is therefore a spiritual, eternal kingdom, not a corporeal, transient kingdom. Therefore we also dwell with our bodies on earth, but with our hearts in heaven, "waiting for the redemption of our bodies, and longing for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ,” Phil. 3:20. 

Afterwards, Martin thought of this doctrine, that Christ's kingdom would be led wonderfully, and he said: "Christ leads his reign wonderfully and foolishly, according to reason. He hides himself and presents himself as weak, which makes it seem as if he is powerless and has no _ authority or power. Nevertheless, he puts to shame the most powerful, cleverest and holiest in the world, emperors, kings, princes, pontiffs, cardinals and bishops, with their courtiers and followers. But it is highly necessary to be sure of the things. 


86. christ holds over his kingdom and protects it, the devil also; but with unequal Armor and weapons. 


The devil challenges Christianity and fights against it with the greatest power and cunning; he attacks it with tyrants, heretics, false brothers, and arouses the whole world against it. On the other hand, Christ resists the devil and his kingdom through a few, small, simple, despised people, with the greatest weakness and foolishness, as it can be seen, and still retains the victory. Therefore he says Matth. 10, 16: "Behold, | send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves." As if to say, "You, my messengers and disciples, will be ill received by the evil world, not only earning ingratitude and contempt with your faithful service, but also being persecuted for it; in sum, they will deal with you as wolves with sheep. Now it is a very unequal, strange warfare, when one sheep has ten, even a hundred or more wolves against it; as happened to the apostles and disciples of Christ, when they sent Christ into all the world to preach, when always one after another was put to death. 

Lions, and even more ferocious monstrous animals 


314Cap . 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 86-90. 315 


should be sent among wolves. But Christ desires to show his supreme power and wisdom in our greatest weakness and foolishness, as the world sees it, and thus to lead the matter out, so that all who oppose his messengers will eat death and go to the devil. For he alone, the LORD of hosts, works miracles, preserves his sheep in the midst of wolves (if they devour one, he sends ten others in its place), and tears the wolves' mouths asunder; so that we may see from this that our faith does not rest on the power, wisdom and deeds of men, but in the power of God. 


87. common question in the world of Christo. 


The meanest and noblest question among those who are called Christians is this: Whether Christ is Christ? That is, whether men are redeemed from death, justified, and saved through him alone? 

The wise men of the world, the learned, and the greatest multitude on earth doubt it. The pope and his followers dispute it and say no to it, as their teaching and life show. In the same way, the red spirits do not want to let Christ be Christ, so that one can obtain forgiveness of sins through him alone, and become pious, righteous and blessed before God, through faith in him alone. We, who have and confess the word of God, say yes to the fact that we are accepted and saved by God through Christ alone: we know, believe and confess that it is the truth; therefore we preach it, therefore we must also suffer ourselves, Psalm 116:10. 

So there are always three sects in disagreement about this article. The first, wno doubts it; the second, who disputes it, denies it and persecutes it; the third, who believes it to be certain and true, even confessing it before the evil world. The former is a great multitude, the latter a small group. 


The prophets’ knowledge of Christ. 


The prophets knew that Christ, when he came, would save those who believed in him from the eternal curse, and therefore also true, natural, and true, natural. 


God, as several prophecies clearly indicate; as Isaiah, Cap. 7, 14, calls him Immanuel, that is, God with us; Jeremiah, Cap. 33, 16, says: "He will be called the LORD, who is our righteousness" 2c. 

But as far as the coincidences and circumstances are concerned, how or by what means he should save the human race from the eternal curse, methinks, all the prophets actually did not know. | think the same and other pious hearts in the people of Israel are preserved in faith, as our children, who badly and simple-mindedly believe that Christ is our Savior and God, also have happy, lovely thoughts about it. 


(89) It does not follow that Christ has done this and that, therefore we also may do it. 


Now some pretend that Christ drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple by force, therefore we may also exercise the same force against the bishops and enemies of the Word; just as coining men and other riotous spirits are supporting themselves in the peasants’ revolt. Anno 1525. No, said D. Martin, Christ has done many things that we should not and cannot imitate him. He walked on water, fasted forty days and forty nights, raised Lazarum from death after he had been in the grave for four days 2c. We will leave that and the like. 

Much less does he want us to stand against the enemies of the truth, but gives the contradiction Matth. 5, 44: "Love your enemies, pray for those who insult and persecute you" 2c. But we are to follow him in the works on which he hung a_ public commandment; as Luc. 6, 36: "Be merciful, as your Father is merciful." Item Matth. 11, 29: "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for | am gentle and humble in heart" 2c. Item Luc. 9, 23: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." 


90. christ's name. 


Nevertheless, the name of Christ remains under the papacy. But | fear, unfortunately, that it will still come to this, that one will call Christ

yet it will not go away. Therefore we may earnestly pray, "Lord, strengthen our faith," Luc. 17:5; for the defect is in us (not in Christ, who has accomplished everything, and has sent us the letter and seal of his grace), that we so waver and falter, and so coldly think that he is our King, High Priest, Bridegroom 2c. He who could grasp this would know the noble art, would be a fine doctor and a blessed man. 


Why the Son of God appeared. 


The Son of God came into the world to redeem us from the devil's power, sin and death, to make us righteous and blessed, and we still flee from him as from the devil. Moreover, if we want to be Christians, we pay little or little attention to the gifts of God, which he gives us abundantly to enjoy for the preservation of this short, fleeting life, and we strive with great diligence for the evil gifts that the devil offers us (which, compared to the eternal goods that Christ gives us, are small, despised crumbs, even if they are great money and goods), and which we obtain and possess against God and right. 

(Cordatus No. 474, the following paragraph.) 

The practice of theology must be experienced, even if it is only in the last hour. But blessed are those who experience it in life, like Schlaginhaufen, Weller and me. 


The temple of all the gods, except Christ, called the Pantheon in Rome. 


In Rome there is a round temple in which the Romans have placed the images of all the gods they worship and adore, so they have called this temple the Pantheon 1) (of all the gods), except for Christ, which image was not placed in it. For what is great, mighty, wise and holy cannot stand Christ, even the whole world rages and rages against him, Ps. 2:1, 2, nor does he remain for ever, and all idols together with those who make and worship them fall to the ground. Ps. 115. therefore more and greater power is needed. 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, 1004, §11. 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 95-98. 


319 


be behind him, because the wise men of the world and the great and mighty lords believe that they want to destroy him, that is, his word and church, to the ground; but they shall and must leave it, and have hellish fire for a reward. 

This temple (pantheon) was subsequently given by Emperor Phocas (the murderer of the pious Emperor Mauritii and the first founder of the Pabst primacy) to Pope Bonifacio the Third in 606 to make it to his liking: he baptized it differently, called it the church of all saints instead of all idols, and did not include Christ, from whom all saints derive their sanctity, thus establishing the invocation of saints and new idolatry. 

To this Bonifacio, the third one, D. M. Luther interprets his name in his Chronica thus: Bonifacius is a papal name, means so much as a good form or reputation; because under a good appearance or form he does vain evil, contrary to God and men. 

When | was D. M. Luther was in Rome, | saw this church: it had no windows, but only a round hole at the top, from which it had light, and was vaulted high: it had such thick marble stone columns or pillars that our two could hardly encompass. At the top of the vault were painted all the gods of the pagans, Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Venus, and whatever else they were called. All these gods were one with each other, so that they might deceive and cheat the whole world; but since Jesus Christ is coming, they do not want to suffer him, nor has he beaten them. Now the popes have come, and have driven him out again; but who knows how long it will last? 


98 The bet does not know Christ and his own. (Cordatus No. 48.) 

As Christ himself, so are we in the world, namely invisible, 2) because the world does not recognize us who believe in Christ, as it does not recognize Christ, who is certainly in the world according to the word: Behold, | am with you. 


2) The et before quod is to be deleted. The second sicut, which D. Wrampelmeyer objects to, is correct. 


320 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ*. § 99-103. 321 


99. knowledge of Christ. 


The righteousness of our works does not consist in fears and mortal misery; indeed, it causes heartache to those who rely on it. Nothing on earth makes man certain (it is called the work or the righteousness of God's law, much less holiness chosen out of human devotion or discretion) that sin is forgiven and not imputed: only the knowledge of Christ, through which man receives comfort and strength of faith in all afflictions and mortal distresses. Without this knowledge of Christ, | cannot suffer any conscience at all; indeed, the devil drives me through sin, so that the world becomes too narrow for me; only the knowledge of Christ straightens me out and satisfies me. 


100. What Christ requires of us. (Cordatus No. 817 and No. 823.) 

God demands nothing else from the believers than: This do in remembrance of me. But if you say, "Yes, Lord, | will be struck on the mouth over this," He answers you [Ps. 50:15], "Call upon Me in time of need, and | will save you." And this is an easy service of God. Of such ease of his service he says that you should seek first the kingdom of God, and after that be of good cheer, for everything else will fall to you. He also promised us help in the cross, so what can we lack? 

If | had as much faith as | should, | would have slain the Turk long ago and made the tyrants mad. | have been so troubled with them, but | lack faith. Meanwhile God says to me [2 Cor. 12:9], "Be content with my grace, for my power is mighty in the weak." 


101. by the grace of God shown to us in Christ. (Contained in Cap. 26, § 16.) 


102. joy in Christ is hindered by the devil. 

We should rejoice in Christ without ceasing, as St. Paul exhorts us, so that we may be completely joyful and full of joy. 


We would be healthy, and could not become either sad or sick. But the wicked Satan hinders such joy wherever he can, goes about without ceasing, tormenting and distressing us, either without means, by his fiery darts, or by wicked poisonous mouths, even by ours. | encounter this very often. 


103. will | not wash you 2c., Joh. 13. 


These words, Joh. 13, 8. where Christ says to Peter: "If | do not wash you, then you have no part with me", are not to be understood that Christ baptized his disciples at that time; because Joh. 14. is clearly expressed that he himself baptized no one, but his disciples, and they among themselves baptized one another, at Christ's command. Also, the Lord did not speak these words about washing water alone, but about the right spiritual washing (but the cause is taken from this physical one), by which he alone, no one else, washes and cleanses Peter, the other disciples and all believers from all their sins, and makes them holy and righteous. As if to say, "I am the only true physician; therefore, if |do not wash you, you will remain unclean and dead in your sins. 

But with this way he also saw the priests' way and ceremonies and wanted to follow them, who, according to the law of Moses, washed their hands and feet before they went into the temple. So does our true eternal priest. As if to say: Before | begin my new kingdom and go into the new temple, and you follow me, | will first wash and cleanse you. But that Christ washed not his own feet, but the feet of the disciples, when the high priest in the law washed not the feet of others, but his own feet, this is the cause: he was unclean and a sinner, like other men, therefore he washed his feet, and offered not only for the sin of the people, but also for his own. But our eternal High Priest is holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners: therefore it was not necessary for him to wash his feet, but he washed us and made us clean from all sins by his blood. 

Above this he wanted to indicate by this foot washing that his new kingdom, which he had 


322 


would not be an external worldly kingdom with a difference of persons, one higher and greater than the other, as in Moses' kingdom, but one should serve the other through humility. As he says Luc. 22, 25. 26.: "The worldly kings rule ... But not so do ye: but let the greatest of you be as the youngest, and the chiefest as a servant." Which He Himself also showed by this ministry of foot-washing, as an example to us, as He says John 13:14, 15: "If | your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. An example have | given you." 


104. miracles of Christ and the apostles. (Contained in Cap. 61, § 6.) 


105. Christ's highest humility. 


Whoever reads the Passion diligently and pays attention to it will see the great humility of the Lord Christ, so that it could not have been greater. But the fact that he humbled himself so deeply is not only due to us, that we should follow his example, as St. Paul very finely points out Phil. 2, 5: "Let every man be of the same mind as Christ was" 2c., but is more due to the devil, that the Lord Christ thereby deceived the trusting, cunning spirit, so that he would be misled about such great humility, and not think that he should be the seed of the woman who would crush his head. As the promise, Genesis 3:15, made to the first parents, reads: "I will put enmity between your seed and the seed of the woman"; as if he wanted to say: | will deal with you, you poisonous serpent. 

In 1533, Doctor Luther interpreted this saying of Paul, Phil. 2, 6, in such a way that Christ "would not have considered it robbery to be like God," namely, that St. Paul wanted to say: Christ is God, but he does not want to be, but wants to be your servant; and that alone does it. 


The greatest miracle that has happened on earth. 


The greatest miracle that has happened on earth is that the Son of God of the most ignominious 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 103-106. 


323 


died on the cross. It seems miraculous to us that the Father should say to his only begotten Son, who is a true, natural God, "Go, be nailed to the gallows of the cross and be hanged. 

Now one should not separate the Godhead from mankind. But | presume that it may be so; nevertheless, the eternal Father's love for his only begotten Son is inordinately greater than Abraham's love was for Isaac. For he is the only beloved Son, as the Father himself testifies from heaven, Matt. 3:17: "This is my beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased." And yet he is so miserably cast down, as "a worm and no man, a mockery of men, and contempt of the people,” Ps. 22:7. 

Blind reason is offended by this; think: If he is the eternal Father's only begotten son, how does he deal with him so mercilessly? Does he not deal more kindly with Caiphas, Herod, Pilate, and the worst evil- doers on earth, than with his Son? St. Paul says that the Jews, that is, the works saints, are offended by this sermon, and the Greeks, that is, the worldly wise, consider it foolishness, 1 Cor. 1:23. But for us Christians it is the greatest comfort, because we know from it, and certainly believe, and do not doubt, that the merciful God and Father so loved the poor, damned world that He did not spare His only begotten Son, but gave Himself up for us all to the most shameful death, so that all who believe in Him might not perish, but be saved, John 3:16. 3, 16. Rom. 8, 32. Therefore we consider this sermon to be our highest wisdom and true golden art, and a divine power by which we are saved, 1 Cor. 1, 24. 

This example is especially meant for those who are afflicted with high spiritual temptations (which everyone cannot bear, such as: Sadness and melancholy of spirit, fear and trembling before God's wrath, judgment and eternal death, and such poisonous, fiery darts of the afflicted Satan), always have before their eyes and comfort themselves with this: that although they feel such heavy and unmistakable suffering much and often, they are not rejected by God for this reason, yes, that He loves them above others, because He has conformed them to the image of His only begotten Son. 


324

325 





They do not doubt that because they suffer with him, he will also deliver them from it, just like him. "For all who want to live godly in Christ must suffer persecution", 2 Tim. 3, 12, but one more than the other, according to whether each is strong or weak in faith; "for God is faithful, who will not let us be tempted above our ability", 1 Cor. 10, 13. 


A wonderful thing is the faith of Christians. 


Our faith is a strange thing, that | and others, who want to be saved in another way, should believe in the man Jesus Christ, that he is the true, natural Son of God, and yet he had to die an ignominious death on the cross, hanged between two evildoers. As he himself said to his disciples shortly before his suffering Luc. 22, 37: "It must yet be fulfilled in me, which is written of me, that he is reckoned among the transgressors; since we have never seen him", 1 Petr. 1, 8. that he is like a stone lying in the sea to us, since we know nothing of it. But because he says in the gospel Joh. 14, 6: "am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but through me"; item, Matth. 28, 18. 19. 20: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me", therefore "go and teach all nations, baptizing them ... and teach them to observe all that | have commanded you." Well then, if he says that he is Lord over all, who has authority in heaven and on earth, then he is and will remain so. 

He proved it at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg a year ago, when the greatest and most powerful leaders in Christendom, both spiritual and secular, were assembled against him, and were furious and angry to destroy his word completely and to exterminate all of us. But if we did not know that he was Lord over all, he would have proved his majesty, so that we should praise and give thanks to him without ceasing, and be sure that he is able and willing to save us from all danger and distress, however great and severe they may be. But what shall | say? This great 


The miracle of this Diet has been forgotten as if it had never happened. The world is no good at all; it is of the devil, as it goes and stands. 


108 Against the Obstacle of Reason. 


We Christians do not allow ourselves to be challenged that reason, the devil's whore, according to her blindness, allows herself to think that there is no more unrighteous, foolish faith than that of the very Christians who believe in a crucified Jew, Jesus Christ. Well, let them lie and mock as long as they can, in the name of their idol, the devil. We have and praise it as the highest grace of God that we recognize and believe in Jesus Christ, who was crucified and died for us, because we know that "no other name has been given to us men, whereby we may be saved. 4, 12. Therefore condemn as blasphemous abominations and lies of the devil all other faiths and religions, as invented by Pabst, Mahomet and others, are certain that God has given away and rejected the founders of these superstitions and false religions in a wrong sense. 


109. difference between the resurrection and ascension of Christ. 


When one of the doctors asked Luther: What is the difference between the resurrection and _ the ascension of Christ? he said: Christ is set over all things by the resurrection, even after mankind, as it is written in the eighth Psalm, v. 7, 8, 9.And the Lord Christ Himself said after His resurrection Matth. 28, 18: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me," although according to the Godhead He was from eternity; but through the Ascension He receives dominion and government over all things. This is the difference, as that | give a likeness of it: A young prince, king or prince, is heir and lord of all the land and people of his lord father, but he is not permitted to rule or reign until his time. To go to heaven and sit at the right hand of the Father Almighty is to be like God, to sit in equal majesty and power, which is called a divine power, and to rule over all. 


326 


110 Ascension Day. 


It was a strange thing to see that Christ disappeared before the disciples’ eyes and ascended to heaven; and the good disciples will have thought in part: We have eaten and drunk with him, and now he is visibly being lifted up from us into heaven; if only it were true? For they were not all equally strong in faith, as Matthew writes in chapter 28, v. 17: "When they saw the Lord, they fell down before him, but some doubted." 

| know Doctor Jonam very well, and if he were to appear now in the air and disappear before our eyes, it would truly give me strange thoughts. But the Lord will be alive for the forty days from the resurrection until the ascension, when he has shown himself alive with many proofs, Acts 1:3. 1:3, taught them all they needed and strengthened them in their faith, reminding them of what he had said to them before, so that they did not doubt his person. Even though it was difficult for them. For when the Lord stood in the midst of them in the evening of Easter day, and said, Peace be unto you. "they were frightened and thought they saw a ghost", Luc. 24, 36. 37. "And Thomas would not believe before that the other disciples had seen the Lord, because he had seen the nail marks in his hands" 2c., Joh. 20, 25. And Acts 1, 7. 1, 7. when he had talked with them forty days about the kingdom of God and was now about to ascend, they asked him: "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" 

But afterwards, when they received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, their minds were much changed, and they were no longer afraid of the Jews, but stood up fearlessly, and preached of Christ with all joy before all the people 2c. And Peter, Apost. 3:6, said to the lame man, "Silver and gold have | none; but what | have | give thee, in the name of JEsu Christ of Nazareth: arise, and walk." And yet afterwards the Lord had to show him by a vision, Apost. 10, 9. ff. that the Gentiles also have the promise of life through Christ. 


Cap. 7: Of the Lord Christ. §110. 


327 


Although he had heard from the Lord before, shortly before his ascension, Marc. 16, 15: "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creatures"; and Matth. 28, 19: "Teach all nations"; and to the Galatians, Cap. 2:14, Paul punished him because a complaint had come against him. | say this to show that the apostles, after receiving the Holy Spirit, did not soon know everything and were sometimes weak in faith. Paul (since all of Asia turned away from him, also some of his disciples departed from him, and many false spirits, who had a great reputation, sat against him) says with a sad heart 2 Thess. 3, 2: "Faith is not for everyone"; item, since he 1 Cor. 2, 3. "| was with you in weakness and fear and great trembling"; 2 Cor. 7:5: "We were always in trouble, struggling on the outside and fearing on the inside": he will not always have been strong in faith, so that the Lord had to comfort him: "Be content with my grace, for my power is mighty in the weak", 2 Cor. 12:9. 

This is comforting to me and to all Christians, for | also believe, but that it would be better, 1) and yet teach others the faith: | know that my teaching is right, but | am still far short of faith. | sometimes think: you preach God's word, the ministry is commanded to you, and you are called to it without your will, you confess and praise Christ, which does not come to pass without fruit, for many do better; but when | see my weakness, that | eat, drink, and at times am also cheerful and a good collationist, then | begin to doubt, and say: Oh, who only could believe! 2) That is why the secure, presumptuous spirits, as heretics (and all false Christians), are peevish, harmful people, who, when they have once looked at the Bible above or heard some sermons, soon make themselves believe that they have the Holy Spirit, understand and know everything. Oh, pious hearts are much differently minded, praying every day, even every moment: "Lord, strengthen our faith," Luc. 17:5. 


1) The meaning of this sentence is: "| should probably have stronger faith." 2) Cf. Cap. 12, § 19; 3, § 32. 


328 


Christ alone is to be heard. (Cordatus No. 816. s If Christ comes and speaks to you (if you repent of your sin) like Moses, "What have you done?" then strike him dead. 1) But if he speaks to you like God and your Savior, stretch out both ears. 


112. lamentation of the godly over their unbelief. 

Is it not a miserable plague that we make our sin so great and grievous, forgetting our baptism, yes, of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave and sacrificed Himself for it, for which "God hath made us, that He should be our righteousness," 2c., 1 Cor. 1:30, which, of course, the devil will have to leave unpunished? 

He who is rich and powerful defies and insists on it, and even if he is a wicked man, he does not worry that he will lose his property and power because of it. A lord, prince remains lord or prince over land and people, even if he is not pious because of his person. So a child is a child and heir to all his father's goods, and does not prevent himself from becoming unclean, courting his mother's bosom, or insulting his father. How is it then that we are so fainthearted, so despondent, and nowhere so wise as the children of the world? Luc. 16:8, so that we cannot also be moved and say (when we feel the power of sins through the law, and the terror of death makes us sweat with fear): What is it now that | have sinned? Is God, who keeps faith forever, Ps. 146, 6, therefore a liar? who through Paul, his chosen armor, speaks Rom. 5, 20: "Grace is much more powerful than sin"; and Ps. 117, 2: "His grace and truth rule over us forever". This would also mean to praise and extol our inheritance, not before the world, but before God, who is pleased with it and makes it the most pleasing service to Him. 


1) A heroic saying, by which is meant to be said: Although someone wants to attack you in Christ's name, do not accept him; Christ is not an angry judge, but a kind savior. Cf. in § 113 the saying, "It is not Christ who terrifies, but the devil." 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. 


§111-113. 329 

Our righteousness is not like the worldly righteousness of which the lawyers speak; but we are called and are righteous because Christ sacrificed himself for us and made us clean from sins, holy and righteous by his holy blood; item, because we have been baptized, have his word and believe. If the devil therefore come, reproach thee with thy sin, and afflict thee, and put thee to death; turn him away from thee unto Christ, who is thy righteousness and life, and let him debate with him. But thou keepest his word. The children are best of all; they trust their fathers, and say plainly, It is my father; and though they sometimes do it, and are wicked, and do evil, and are reproached for it, yet they dispute not whether he be father or no father; therefore they do best. 


113. a different. (The beginning of this § contained in Cap. 58, § 9, para. 5, therefore omitted. The following Cordatus No. 574. 2) 

It is the most insolent vice and the greatest deception of Satan that we trust men more than God. | do more good to my wife and all of you than to Christ, knowing that no one has done such things for me as he has. And although he has done so great things for me, | fear him more than | love him. As soon as | say, "Yes, | ama poor sinner," Christ answers, "I died for you, that is why | baptized you, that is why | teach you every day. How patiently he bore the apostles’ lack of understanding, and how kindly he dealt with them, we must diligently take heed. Christ, compared with all who are by nature the most kind, is yet alone the lamb, those the lions. The evil spirit reverses all this with the highest art, and makes of the kindest Christ a severe judge. But know this, that it is not Christ who terrifies, but the devil. This believe me, as when GOD speaketh, for the Holy Ghost speaketh to man, by a man, without [special] revelation. Pommer has with words that are not directed to it 


2) Cf. cap. 2, § 58.

114. name JEsus Christ. 


| have and know nothing of Jesus Christ, because | have neither seen nor heard him bodily, but only his name. But | have learned so much about him from the Scriptures, praise God, that | am content to let him suffice me, and for this reason | do not desire to see or hear him in the flesh. Moreover, in my greatest weakness, in the terror and feeling of the burden of sin, in fear and trembling before death, in persecution of the wicked world, | have often experienced and felt the divine power, which this name has demonstrated in me, who was otherwise abandoned by all creatures, snatched me out of the midst of death, made me alive again, comforted me in the greatest despair, especially in the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, that |, if God wills, will remain by the name, live and die. . And before | would allow in my life that Erasmus or another, be he called and be he who he will, should be too close to my Lord Christ with his godless and false doctrine, however delicious color he paints it, to 


The Jews, who are obdurate, thirsty and foolish, drive out and murder many pious people as the worst heretics; but some (as the red spirits and enthusiasts, called Anabaptists, Sacramentans, Antinomians, or others who will come after us) falsify and pervert the good word: so it is in the end, and must break in a short time. As happened to the Jews. When they ascribed Christ's teachings and deeds to the devil and blasphemed him on the cross, the whole creature trembled, for it could not bear it. The sun lost its light, the curtain in the temple was torn, the earth shook, the rocks were torn, the graves were opened. And when the Lord had swept his threshingfloor and gathered the wheat into his sheds, he set fire to the chaff 2c. So will he do now at the end of the world, when the number of his elect is fulfilled. 


117. no one leads to heaven 2c., says Christ John in the 3rd chapter. 


As if he wanted to say: Without me, no one can become pious and righteous before God by his own strength, merit, self-chosen holiness, not even by the works of the law, nor can he enter the kingdom of heaven. For | am and remain in heaven, and yet for this reason | came down from heaven, that | might 


adorn and decorate it, before | would not live. Yes, itltake you up with me. From this it follows that only 


would be more tolerable for me to suffer all torment and torture, together with my wife and child, and finally die the most shameful death, than to see such things and keep quiet about them. 


How a believing soul talks to Christ. 


(Contained in Cap. 48, § 35 and already printed: Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, 1509.) 


The blasphemy of Christ and his word makes it all. 


When people blaspheme Christ, persecute and condemn His Word as surely and boldly as the papists and their followers, blinded by the devil, are now doing 


1) The conclusion of this section is contained in Cap. 1, § 5, last paragraph. The preceding paragraph follows directly from Cap. 58, § 9. 


those who believe in Christ obtain forgiveness of sins, are justified before God and inherit the kingdom of heaven, that for this reason he came down from heaven into the world, that he took on human nature and through his suffering and resurrection redeemed us from the power of the devil, sin and death, and made us heirs of the kingdom of heaven; as he further says Joh. 3:14, 15: "As Moses lifted up a serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up," that is, crucified and slain, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 

In these three words (gone to heaven, come down from heaven, and be in heaven, which mean three different times) he briefly summarizes his omnipotence. 1. "Coming down from heaven" is that he descends to heaven. 


832 


He appeared on earth, became man (equal to us in all things, but without sin), let his glory be seen through teaching and miracles, and finally accomplished the work of redemption of the human race. 2) "To go to heaven" means that he will no longer appear on earth in bodily form. 3. to be in heaven is that he has never left the right hand of the Father, that is, the Godhead, but has always been and still is in heaven, that he has never left or will never leave the human nature he has assumed. 


If God is for us, who can be against us? Rom. 8. 


Now Christ our Lord and God has swallowed up death for our comfort and salvation forever. Now that death has been swallowed up forever through Christ, sin, which is the sting of death, has become blunt, so that it now has no edge or point to prick us, that is, to frighten, accuse and condemn us. So also the law is eternally unable to strengthen sin, that is, the law 


Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 117-119. 


333 


The faith that has been grasped through the word will be saved through patience. In his time faith will become a public and eternal vision, the invisible will become visible (as in the beginning of creation the world, which was not yet visible, became a visible and essential world), and man will have eternal life, bliss, joy and happiness. Happy is he who understands this and would like to believe it! 


119 Christ is the only consolation of his believers in their cross and suffering on earth. 


Scripture testifies that all the godly must suffer persecution, 2 Tim. 3, 12, and enter the kingdom of God through tribulations, Acts 14, 22. 14, 22. Therefore St. Peter admonishes the believers to "resist the devil, who walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, firmly in faith", 1 Petr. 5, 8. Further v. 9: They are not the only ones who are challenged by the devil and the evil world, but "should 


cannot drive us, nor convince us that we are sinners;| know that their brethren have the same suffering from yes, those who are in Christ and walk in the Spirit, not! time to time in all the world". Such is the feeling of according to the flesh, as Paul says Gal. 5:16. devout hearts who are serious about holding fast to 

In this way the devil is also captured, stripped and] the word of Christ and persevering in his grace and judged, and all power is taken away from him, so that! knowledge to the end. Let us not speak of the poor he cannot continue to rule over us forever. So also all ang afflicted consciences, who (especially in this last the fury, raging and raging of the blind false world, the} gruesome time, when the furious devil is pouring out 


devil's bride, has become a mockery and laughter; for what can it do more than kill the body and promote us the more temporally to eternal life and bliss? Therefore all misfortune, be it sickness, poverty, affliction, misery, sorrow, all kinds of suffering, is far too little and small, even if it lasts a hundred years and even longer, compared to the future glory that will be revealed to us on the blessed day of our redemption, Rom. 8:18. 

This is not the case with us and in us, but we feel the contradiction quite rightly; that is why faith is necessary, which neither sees nor gropes, but sticks to the word. But hope waits 


all his wrath and fury) suffer innumerable times to and fro, under the godless tyrants in the papacy and in Turkey, in various ways: Who, in their distress and anguish, have no other consolation than to have Christ, the Son of God, as their Savior and Advocate with the Father, to keep His word, and to have a heartfelt longing and desire for His blessed appearing, when He will finally redeem them and abundantly satisfy all their sufferings for eternity. 

Then one will look at the other, will confess us to each other, and say: Behold, how do we come together here? Who would have thought of this wonderful, blessed change? On earth we were the most miserable, unworthy, well-suffering people, had to be heretics and rebels, and 


334 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 119-123. 335 


as a curse of the world and children of the devil let the tyrants execute us. Where are they now, the angry nobles, the great, mighty kings and lords, who wanted to exterminate Christ, his word and poor little people to the ground? who spat at us, mocked and ridiculed us, trampled us underfoot, threw us into the towers, chased us out, inflicted all plagues and tortures on us, had us executed by fire and sword? Where are the holy spiritual fathers who banished, cursed and handed us over to the devil as the worst blasohemers and deceivers of the world? They are in the abyss of hell, "since their worm does not die and their fire is not extinguished," Isa. 66:24. On the other hand, we who have heard Christ, according to his Father's command, have believed in him, have held fast to his word, and have borne our cross for a little while, hardly even for a moment, compared to the great glory that is now revealed to us, now live in Christ in unspeakable eternal joy and blessedness, and praise him together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, with all the dear angels and saints. 


120. Apart from Christ, one should not remember God. 


No other God is to be remembered except Christ, of whom the Father testified: "This is the one you shall hear", Matth. 17, 5. The God who does not speak through Christ's mouth is not God. In Judaism, God would not hear anywhere except at the mercy seat, Exodus 25:22: so He will not hear anyone except through Christ. But as the majority of the Jews did not ask for the mercy seat, but ran from time to time, burned incense here and there on the high mountains and hills, or under the green trees, and sought God in various places; in part also out of great devotion, their sons and daughters, to God (yes, to the devil, as the 106th Psalm, v. 37). Psalm, v. 37, says) in honor of God and to serve him with it: the same happens in Christianity; the great multitude is drowned in their thoughts and carnal devotion; one seeks God in St. Jacob's, another in Rome, the third in the monastery, and so on. This is called 


the prophet Isaiah Cap. 53, 6: "going astray and looking to his own", self-chosen, not to God's "ways". For whoever seeks God apart from Christ will never find Him, and will do as he pleases. Whoever does not follow this word of Christ ("No one comes to the Father except through me", Joh. 14, 6.) is eternally lost. 


(Here a section of 26 lines is omitted because. contained in Cap. 2, § 84, paras. 7-9.) 


The enmity between Christ and the devil started in paradise. 


No wonder that Satan is hostile to Christ and opposes his word, kingdom and people with all his power and cunning. There is an old hatred and enmity between them, which began in paradise. So they are also of a perverse kind and nature. He smells Christ over several hundred miles. In Constantinople, he hears that we teach, speak and preach against his kingdom here in Wittenberg; he also senses what harm comes to him from this, which is why he rages and rages so horribly. 

But it is more to be wondered at that among us men (who are of the same kind and nature, and so firmly bound together by the bond of love that one should love another as himself) there should be such great ill- will, envy, hatred, anger, dissension, discord, revengefulness, that one should murder the other over it. Who is closer to the husband than his wife? to the son than his father? to the daughter than her mother? to the cord than her sister-in-law? and again. Item, brothers and sisters could not be closer related to each other: nor is it rare to find unity, love and friendship among them. The pagans also noticed this and complained about it, but they did not know that all this is the work of the wicked devil. 


Christ is an unworthy guest in the world. (Contained in Cap. 4, K 42.) What Christ is for a king, 


Christ does not pay much attention to the worldly and domestic regiment, because he is not 


336 


He did not come to be a worldly lord, but for this reason he became man, that he might be a king, to destroy the devil's kingdom and to make the people blessed. As he himself says: "The Son of Man came to save that which was lost", Luc. 19, 10. But he is foolish enough to do so. 


Christ and the law cannot dwell together in one conscience. 


(This § is in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, cap. 5. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, §44. 45.) 


In Christ we have everything. 


Oh dear God! said D. Martin, that we might trust in you and give thanks to you, who have cared for us in this way, yes, who have given us and bestowed upon us everything in Christ. For this is the great unspeakable mystery, which is hidden from all worldly and carnal wisdom, namely, that God, the heavenly and almighty Father, has died to us in His majesty, has manifested everything and given it to the Son, who is now our flesh and blood, yet without sin. To the same he directs us. If we alone hear and accept him, we shall have all things in him. For our sake he should be crucified so miserably and horribly by the most holy people, who had the greatest name. For Annas is as much as John; Caiphas as Peter; Judas as aking of the Jews. They had to take offense at your Christ and become knights at him. Summa, those who have had the greatest name in the world have been the worst scoundrels.

131. Christ's burden that he has borne. 


Christ had to bear the sins of all the world, and all the blood that has been shed since the beginning and will be shed in the future. He had (1 mean) a burden on him, under which he would have had to sink, if he were not true natural God, and did it all for our sake; but few among us thank him for it. 


Christ must have a big mouth and wants us to accept his words. 


(The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 709.) 


When Christ speaks a word, he opens his mouth, which is as wide as heaven and earth, even if he only speaks of a herb. He said this on the occasion of the words [Gen. 1:28]: "Grow and multiply, and fill the earth." 

Item, he said at another time: If the emperor speaks a word, that can do something; but if Christ speaks, he fasts heaven and earth at one bite. Therefore, when he speaks, the man's word must be regarded as different from the word of man, for he is truly God himself. 


Christ has interpreted the law. 


When Christ preached Matt. 5, he consulted, punished and refuted the false interpreters and interpreters of the law, and set right again Moses, whom they had adulterated, saying, Thus and so shall ye understand Moses.

139. Of the Preference of God's Word. 


Of the merit of God's word, Luther said: "Christ has lonce visibly come to earth and has lived among us and made us see his glory; he has accomplished the work lof redemption of the human race out of God's deliberate counsel and providence. | do not desire that lhe should come yet once, nor do | want him to send ime an angel.

And that D. Luther himself told this story: that he once prayed fervently in his little room and thought of how Christ hung on the cross, suffered and died for our sins; there was a bright glow on the wall and a glorious figure of Christ with the five wounds appeared in it, and looked at him, the doctor, as if it were the Lord Christ himself in the flesh. When the doctor saw it, he first hought it was something good, but soon he thought it must be the devil's ghost, because Christ appeared to : lus in his word and in a low, humble form, as he had

The devil had admonished her that she should not let the devil make a monkey out of her. Thereupon, she spit in the face of the image; the devil soon disappeared and the image was transformed into a large snake, which ran to the virgin in bed and bit her ear, so that the drops of blood stood on her ear and flowed down, and the snake was soon gone. Luther himself saw this with his eyes along with many others. 


140. Christ alone is to be defied and insisted upon. 


Well then, we have trusted in the man, the Lord Christ, the Son of God, who will certainly not leave us. Our life and limb are upon him: where he abideth, there shall we abide also: else know | nothing that | can contend against. Therefore, if Christ lives, he will know that we do and suffer all things for his sake, preaching, teaching, writing.

Christ and Satan cannot get along. 


1) Christ and Belial cannot be reconciled nor reconciled with each other, and humanly speaking they cannot let up on one thing: neither gives way to the other, it is an eternal enmity between them. For, the papists admit that they are wrong in indulgences,

Because the devil is a prince and god of the world, f the Lord Christ, of his word and of those who have it pure and unadulterated and hold fast to it, he must nd will also receive it, of whom it is written Ps. 110, : "You are a priest forever" 2c. and Ps. 2, 6: "| have ppointed my king on my holy mountain" 2c. And it is mpossible that Christ and the devil can get along with ach other in one bed, one must cast out the other. hus we Lutherans and Papists cannot dwell under ne roof with each other, neither can suffer the other, ne part must give way to the other. The Jews and the postles were also under one roof, but the Jews had 0 give way.

145. Apart from Christ, everything is wickedness. 


All that is in the world, apart from Christ, may be o high and delicious, may seem so angelic, and may e called holiness, honorable life, virtue, discipline, onor; but it is nothing more than a cover of shame, nder which lies hidden the highest wickedness, yes, he devil himself.

But Alexander did not forget his stulties, for he often got drunk and stabbed his good friends when he got drunk; indeed, he drank himself to death at Babel afterwards. 

Our youthful years are nothing: when one reaches the age of twenty, what does he understand? People are not as strong now as they were a long time ago. Solomon was not much over twenty years old when he became king, but he must have been instituted by Nathan; so our Lord God also appears to him, and says: He should ask what he wants, and God will give it to him; then he desires wisdom: this pleases our Lord God very well, as the text says 1 Kings 3:5 ff. Now one would desire a box of money, even my most gracious Lord himself. Well, they say, if | had money, | would get it. 


(Here, § lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 43, § 33, para. 2.) 


150 Christ soon grew tired of this life, and so did his Christians. 


Christ did not want to be long here on earth in the preaching ministry, but handed over the kingdom and rule to his Father, and appointed apostles. Of the same (as well as the others) Paul writes Phil. 1, 23: "I desire to be dissolved" (that is, to die). They also have enough of this life. So now we also cry out, we are tired and weary of this life, we also desire that God take us to His heaven only soon, or come with the last day, and put an end to the game (since the falsification of doctrine and other vices have become rampant). Our Lord God must be a humble man, so that he can provide the world with people.

Christ humbled and humbled himself deeply. (Contained in Cap. 7, §105.) 


152: How Christ distributes his merit. (Cordatus No. 519. 2) 


A merit is a work for the sake of which Christ has given a reward, but Christ gives us because of His promise. As when a prince says: Come to me to my castle, | will give you a hundred guilders. Here | do a work by going to the castle, for the sake of which the florins are certainly not given to me; not for the sake of any merit, but for the sake of the promise. 


153 The Christians' Consolation. (Composed of Cap. 1, § 54, para. 1. u. Cap. 7,§ 71.) 


154 Christ's preaching has not been like this, as now at the time of the Gospel. (Contained in Cap. 12, § 26.) 


Hearing Christ is the greatest worship. 

When one asked, "What is the greatest service that pleases God?" D. Martinus said. Martinus: Hearing Christ and being obedient to him is the greatest and highest worship; otherwise all is useless. For he has it in heaven much better and more beautiful than we can do it; otherwise Saul's sacrifice and service would also have pleased him, since he said, "Your service and sacrifice only provoke me to anger," 1 Sam. 15, 22. ff, and was nevertheless from the outside the most beautiful and best service. Thus says the fortieth Psalm, v. 7: "Thou wilt not have heave offerings and burnt offerings, but they shall be obedient unto thee. Just as the men of war say in wars: Obedience and keeping to the letter of the articles is the victory. 


Christ alone is the comfort and hope of Christians. (Contained in Cap. 7, §1, penultimate paragraph.)

157. Christ is a bishop of our souls. 


The best help for Christians is, said D. Martinus, that Christ is a high priest and bishop of our souls. 


God is not only the God of the Jews, but also the God of the Gentiles. 


St. Paul wrote the epistle to the Romans solely for

It was said to D. Luther in 1543 that Christ said to the Gentile woman, "He has not come but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," and yet he helps her as a Gentile and heals her daughter; therefore he must

Luther answered and said: "Christ was not sent to the Gentiles, but when the Gentiles came to him, he did not reject them: he was personally sent only to the Jews, therefore he also preached in the Jewish country, but through the apostles his teaching went into the whole world. Thus St. Paul calls the Lord Christ "a minister of the circumcision, because of the promise which God : ; made to the fathers, since God kept His promise truly, What the world thinks of Christo. and the Jews can boast of God's truth, but the Christ must be the world's joke, mockery and|Gentiles shall boast of God's mercy", Rom. 15, 8. 9, ridicule.

1) Cf. § 157 of this Cap. 


348 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ All the promises made to Abraham are also true. But the dear apostles understood it with difficulty. They were good rough fellows, they could not have done otherwise: they must have thought they wanted to become great lords; they had already divided the people among themselves from time to time. As the two disciples who went to Emmaus when Christ died said, Luc. 24, 21: "We hoped that he would redeem Israel. But this opinion had to be mortificiret. They could not think otherwise, the good fellows. The Lord Christ still treats them kindly, and he is much too kind to them. It is written in the legend of St. Peter that St. Peter always had a little cloth with him to wipe himself, and that he finally got red eyes; and | will believe it. When he was asked why he was crying, he said that when he remembered the most pleasant company of Christ with the apostles, he could not refrain from tears. Christ must have been a good, kind man: and so he still deals with us daily, but we do not recognize it. But after that, on the day of Pentecost, they will be taught differently. 


Christ cannot be unlearned. 


Christ is incomprehensible, no one can learn him in this life, so that he would understand what and who he is, because he is God. | cannot explain my own actions, movements and thoughts, how could | explain the majesty of Christ? 


166 Of Christ's Kingdom. (Cordatus No. 1759.) 


Since Christ reigns in his kingdom, he says: | baptize you, | give you the sacrament, receive, eat, drink, | preach to you. But in the worldly kingdom the ruler says: Do this, and | will give you this 2c. A king seeks his advantage, but Christ ours, with the gentlest words, but those are the cruelest oppressors. The harsher they are, the better. But in Christ's kingdom, the more gentle 2c. 


.§ 164-171. 349 


How to signify Christ. (Cordatus No. 1416.) 


Christ's history is to be regarded in three ways, first, as a history, second, as a gift, third, as an example. The stories are the most reliable examples of faith and unbelief. 


168. repugnant works of Christ and the devil. (Cordatus No. 659.) 


Christ and the devil are different in work and office, for the latter is the author of life, the sustainer of righteousness, the creator of heaven and earth; the latter, on the other hand, is the lord of death, the author of sin, and definitely the destroyer of all that Christ builds up. In short, all evil and all sickness are works of the devil. But when God ascribes evil to himself in the Scriptures, he did so for the sake of the Manichaeans, who set up two gods, one good and one evil. 


Christ bears the curse of the law. 


The malediction and curse of the law was borne, taken upon Himself, and abolished by Christ alone, and all this is found there; so that those who have the spiritual blessing and benediction bear and suffer the bodily curse and malediction are persecuted and well afflicted; the wicked here generally go empty-handed. 


170) Above the article of Christo, one should hold. (Contained in Cap. 12, § 35, sub. 2.) 


171. forgiveness of sins. 


Forgiveness of sins does much, therefore God can forgive the church under the papacy, especially because baptism has remained pure, as well as the sacrament and the text of the Holy Scriptures. Even if they have been tainted by glosses and jugglery, as accidentia, the essence has remained for itself, which has adhered to the hearts that should have caught it, there has been especially great power and authority. 


350 Cap. 7. Of the Lord Christ. § 171-177. 351 


(This paragraph Cordatus No. 1403.) The article of forgiveness of sins is in all creatures. (Here three lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 13, § 55) 

(From here to the end of the § at Cordatus No. 134.) 

Grace does not take away nature, but changes it, and uses it for the glory of God, e.g. the gentle nature of a person who is kind and calm by nature, like Hausmann, uses it in the preaching ministry, so that the sensitive people, who cannot stand anything, have a preacher who presents everything sweetly to them, on the other hand, when God needs a messenger, who seriously lectures his things and dares to rebuke the recalcitrant 1) he uses the wrath of a fierce man, a man like Cordatus, who is harsh in words and manner, so that those who are not converted by the gentleness of the one may be converted by his harshness, or perish, so that they have no excuse. Thus [God] also uses for the best those who are scheming, devious, those who have great intellect, the boasters and the like, so that everything may bring salvation to His elect. 


172. write or speak Bon GOD's grace. (Contained in Cap. 26, § 16.) 


173. How God's grace is fasted. (Contained in Cap. 1, § 5, sub. 3.) 


174. strokes make you angry. 


After the plague we get angry, like the Jews after the thunder and lightning at Mount Sinai. As we Germans also say, "The sick man was never worse than when he recovered. Therefore it must all come by grace, if we are to be saved. 


175 David's fame from his piety. 


Why does David praise and exalt his piety, purity and innocence so highly, since he has 


1) Instead of in moriMros ilLvioriseros will have to be read, as D. Wrampelmeyer conjicirt correctly. 





was a murderer and adulterer? Answered D. M. Luther: You must look well at the little word (meam) "my"; for when David speaks: My piety or righteousness, give him a right Correlativum, my righteousness, namely, against my enemies, there | am pious, for you, my God, know that | have a good cause. 

So it is with baptism and absolution: if we go away, we are also pious; yes, before men, but not against God; if he wanted to act seriously with us, we are not yet pious. So my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, must now also be pious against the one of Brunswick, and say: You know my piety against my enemies, not against God; for we have a good, just cause, they are evil. 


176: Reason's annoyance at Christ's weakness. 


Reason, when it sees Christ born a little child, lying in its mother's womb at the breast and sucking, cannot recognize Him as a Savior and Beatificator of the world: so do the enthusiasts in the Sacrament of the Altar. Just as Christ was wiped out of the grave with a great earthquake, so also today there is and will always be a tumult and tumult in the world, when Christ's obedience, holiness and merit are preached, praised and believed that he alone is our Savior. But such an earthquake is more salutary and pleasing to pious, godly hearts to see and hear than Christ lying in the grave and resting: if there is peace and tranquility in Christendom, it is an evil sign. 


177 Christ was silent until his thirtieth year before he entered the ministry. 

Christ abstained from preaching and teaching until his thirtieth year, and always kept silent, neither letting himself be heard nor heard in public. However, since he had so much and so many impiety, abominable idolatry, theft of God, false worship, so many

Yet he jeven deal with a few words of the Scriptures, and the was able to refrain from doing so until he was publicly |Holy Scriptures were even covered up, unknown and 


called to the preaching ministry. 


178. Christ's words are powerful. (Cordatus No. 542.) 


The words of Christ are very strong, have hands and feet, and pass over all the counsels, cunning, and wisdom of the wise, and he puts them to shame with the simplest words and thoughts, that we can do nothing nor escape, as, "Pray unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's." There he neither forbids nor commands anything, but yet he concludes them with their own words, saying, "If you have caused Caesar to be so [far] broken down that you must have his coin, give him what is his. [Matth. 22, 20. 21.] 


179 Ways of Preaching in the Papacy. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1322.) 


In the past, it was considered feminine and childish to mention Christ in the pulpit. Scotus, Bonaventure, Occam, Aristotle and Plato ruled. 1) 

People were somewhat ashamed and shy, indeed, they considered it to be almost inconsistent, effeminate and a disgrace to call Christ on the 


buried. 


180 Christ's intercession and preaching are certain. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 95.) 


181 Believing in Christ alone makes you blessed. 


There it is, said D. M. Luther, there it is. Whoever believes in the man called Jesus Christ, God's only Son, has eternal life; as He Himself says John 3:16: "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 

If others do what they want, they are still lost, and neither Moses nor the law helps here; indeed, Moses and the law kill man, and do not give life, but death. Therefore it is all up to the Son, who brings eternal life. He who has the Son of God has eternal life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life: for the Son must please God, and God cannot be hostile to the Son. Where the Son is, there he looks, and is well pleased with him. Therefore, in short, it shall be the son alone before God, and nothing else. If you do not believe in the son, whether you are a monk or a nun, a Carthusian or a barefoot, you are already

Chapier 8. 


Of the Holy Spirit. 


1. of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 

2. when the Holy Spirit has begun to fulfill His ministry. 

3. what the Holy Spirit is. 

4. the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 

5. with what the Holy Spirit comforts, and why he is called a comforter. 


1. of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. (Cordatus No. 1036 and No. 1159.) 


The spirit is one and the same, but it has two offices, for the spirit of grace makes God pleased with us and us pleased with God. But it is the spirit of prayer that prays for us and the whole world that good may come and evil may depart. The spirit of grace teaches others, the spirit of prayer asks that the name of God be sanctified, that his kingdom come 2c. 

Notice that it is one thing to have the Holy Spirit and another to have the revelation of the Spirit. Before Christ, many had the Holy Spirit, but they did not have the revelation of the Spirit. 

(The following is contained in Cap. 13, § 35. The following 

paragraph in Cordatus No. 1310.) 

The Spirit is always first in teaching, but not in hearing. He is preceded by the word and followed by the spirit. 


2. when the Holy Spirit has begun to fulfill His ministry. 


(This § is found in the house postilla in the sermon on the holy day of Pentecost. Pentecost. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. XIII, Col. 2057, § 21; Col. 2058, § 22; Col. 2059 f., § 26. 27; Col. 2051, § 9. 10; Col. 2052, 8 11; Col. 2053, § 14.) 


3. what the Holy Spirit is. 

The Holy Scriptures testify, and the Nicene Symbol confesses and teaches from the Holy Scriptures, that the Holy Spirit is the one who gives life, and who is worshipped and honored at the same time as the Father and the Son. Therefore, the Holy Spirit must also be true, eternal God with the Father and the Son in one being. For where 


Why the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Truth. 

Why the Holy Spirit is called a witness. 

8. testimonies of the Holy Scriptures that the Holy Spirit is also God, and yet another person than the Father and the Son. 


If he were not the true, eternal God, then the divine power and honor, that he makes alive and is worshipped and honored with the Father and the Son at the same time, could not be attributed to him either; as the holy fathers have vigorously claimed and preserved this from the Scriptures against the heretics. 


4. the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 

The Holy Spirit is an eternal, almighty God, as we believe and confess in our Christian faith: to Him the Lord Christ gives special names, and calls Him 1) a Punisher, who punishes the world for sin 2c. 2) A Comforter. 3) A spirit of truth. 4) That he proceeds from the Father, and thus is true, eternal, almighty God with the Father and the Son. 5) That he testifies of Christ 2c. 


5) With what does the Holy Spirit comfort? and why is He called a Comforter? 


(This § is found in the sermon on Sunday Exaudi in the Hauspostille. Walch, St. Louis ed. Vol. XIII, Col. 622, § 2 and 3; Col. 623, § 4.

1. difference of hereditary and real sin. 

None of the Fathers in the Church thought of original sin, except Augustine, who distinguished original sin from real sin, namely that original sin is evil lust and desire, and a root and origin of all real sin. And even though the wages of sin is death, as St. Paul says Rom. 6, 23, such lust in believers is not a mortal sin, but only a daily sin, which God forgives them and does not cause them to commit.

The people of the world are not to be reckoned with because of their faith in Christ, and because they resist it with the help and assistance of the Holy Spirit. 

St. Paul writes and points out the difference between mortal sin and daily sin to Romans 8, v. 13, where he says: "If you live according to the flesh, you will die. But if ye by the spirit of the flesh kill business, ye shall live." Here you have a very clear distinction in saints and epicureans. 


358 Cap. 9. of sin. §2-4. 


2. sinning against the recognized truth. 


Many papists do and argue against the known truth, as well as the heretics and fanatics. But we have a rule given to us by the Holy Spirit, as St. Paul says Titus 3:10, 11: "Avoid a heretical man, when he has been admonished once and again. And know that such a one is reprobate, and sins, as one who has condemned himself." And Christ Matth. 15, 14: "Let them go, they are blind and blind leaders. Thus Doct. Pommer used to say, "If a man is blind, he cannot see. For if it is a bad error, done out of simplicity, one gives way to the admonition and lets himself be taught; but if it is a stubborn will, one does not give way, but remains stubbornly on it. Just as Pharaoh was hardened and hardened and did not recognize his sin or humble himself before God until he was thrown into the Red Sea. 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 1564.) 

| think that if Moses had used the signs in Egypt for one, two or three years, they would have been used like the suns 2c. That is how ungrateful the world is. 

1) D. Carlstadt also had such a stubborn mind: when he promoted someone to the doctorate in Wittenberg, he had an oration and said: "| stand here and promote this one, and know that | do wrong and commit a mortal sin: but | do it for the sake of two florins, which | get from it. But he introduced the saying of Christ, Matth. 23, 10., where he says: "You shall not be called masters"; from this he wanted to prove that neither Magistros nor Doctores should be promoted. Since in the same place the Lord Christ admonishes us that we should beware of sects and cults and let the Lord Christ alone be master in divine matters. Otherwise, children would not be allowed to call their parents father and mother, because God also allows Himself to be called Father. What was to become of it? Since the word, Carlstadt has also fallen and fallen into various errors and remained in them. 


1) This narrative in another version also Cap. 67, 8 9. 


359 


Therefore, a distinction should be made between those who sin out of simplicity and those who sin wantonly out of hardening. 


3. sin in Holy Spirit. (Cordatus No. 339.) 


There are six sins against the Holy Spirit, which, although they amount to one, are different in their deeds, or rather misdeeds. The first is presumption, 2. arguing against the known truth, 3. hardening, 4. despair, 5. begrudging his brother grace, and the sixth: impenitence to the end. 2) 


4. sinning from ignorance, whether it is sin, and from the difference of ignorance. 


It was asked of the saying Augustini: Whether that alone is sin, which happens willingly? From this it follows that what is done out of ignorance is not sin. Then said D. Mart. Luther said, "Augustine speaks of the will in a worldly and common way, as the right- wingers are accustomed to speak of it, not theologically; as he then interprets and explains this saying himself in the recanting books. Moreover, anyone who sins in error does so willingly, without constraint; it is a deliberate error. But the papists do not sin in error, but knowingly with will; for they now know, especially the most distinguished among them, that our doctrine is right and founded in God's Word, as they themselves confessed and said at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530. 3) 

For when the Confession of the protesting estates was read before the emperor and all the estates of the empire, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria (who was vehemently opposed to the teaching of the Gospel) said to Doct. Eck: "Doctor, can this thing also be overturned from the Holy Scriptures? Then Doct. Eck, the theologian, said: No, it cannot be overturned with the Holy Scripture, but with the Fathers. Thereupon the Bishop Albrecht of Mainz, Cardinal, had said to the Duke of Bavaria 


2) For the continuation of this, see Appendix No. II. 3) Cf. Cap. 27- § 150, towards the end. 


360 


Cap. 9: Of sin. § 4. 5. 


361 


See, how fine our theologians hold with us; those, the] one willfully does not want to know a thing, which the 


Lutherans, have to prove their thing in the Scriptures, we have it outside the Scriptures! 

The same bishop Albrecht also said at this imperial diet (since several committees had been formed by princes and theologians to reconcile and compare the Lutherans and the papists): "Ah! what is the point of much concord! see, the Lutherans have one article, even if all the others were not right, so one cannot refute the same, namely of marriage. And V. Luther said, when he told this: Haec testimonia ipsorum valde nos confirmant: These testimonies of them strengthen us very much. 

But theologically, according to the Holy Scriptures, everything is called and is willingly sinful; for we are all sinners by nature, conceived and born in sins, completely corrupt and poisoned, have an evil will from Adam, which is always contrary to God, unless it is negated and changed by the Holy Spirit through the Word. Neither the philosophers nor the jurists know or understand anything about this, therefore they are excluded from the theological circle and the judicial obligation to recognize and judge the doctrine apart from God's word. 

But there are three kinds of ignorance: one is called insurmountable; the other gross; the third assumed. The insurmountable one is when | know nothing about the rights described, whether they are divine or human. And this one excuses and makes all peoples and nations innocent. For although they neither know nor believe that God is triune in person and became man, they are excused for this insurmountable ignorance by reasonable, worldly- wise people, but it does not apply in theology. For St. Paul says Rom. 3, 23: "They are all sinners" 2c., and Rom. 5, 12: "Death has come to all men", and also rules over those who have not sinned, that is, even over little innocent children and infants. 

Gross ignorance is when one does not want to learn; he is cheaply ignorant, that is, he is excused in something, but not at all. 

But assumed ignorance is when 


lawyers call dolum malum, bad trickery, because one does not want to know it; as our papists are now. 


5. the greatest sins committed against God. 


The greatest sins committed against God are those committed against the first tablet, understood in the first three commandments: but no one understands nor feels the sin, except the one who has the Holy Spirit and the grace of God. Therefore, everyone is sure, and since such have angered God and become the devil's own, they still think they are well off with God; even if they falsify, persecute and condemn His commandment and word, they still think in their mind that they are doing God a favor and special service. As, an example: 

Paul did not weep otherwise, he did God a favor by helping to defend the law; for he considered the law of God the highest, noblest and greatest treasure on earth, just as we now consider the gospel. And he wanted to put life and limb on it and leave it above, and in short defend the law; and he lacked nothing at all in understanding, wisdom and power, if he had need of it. But before he looked around, and when he thought his cause was best, he received another command, and it was said to him, that all his works, doings, diligence and zeal were against God. And yet he had the best reputation and appearance among scholars, wise men and saints, so that everyone had to say that Paul acted rightly and did godly, good works, because he was zealous for God's honor and His law. 

He also had the arguments and the reason for himself, which could not be overturned nor refuted by reason. But God found a solution and struck him on one ear so that he fell to the ground and had to hear: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Apost. 9:4, as if to say, "In order that you may think you are serving me, you are persecuting me with hostility. And that it may be true, read this lesson: Thou boastest that thou hast my word, and understandest the law, and dost earnestly desire it.

which the Turk has now brought under him; Hungary is almost gone as well. We Germans, and other nations, also do not want to hear the gospel nor suffer, therefore they must hear and suffer the devil's hordes, the Anabaptists and sacrament abusers. Alfo it shall happen, where one despises the word of God, and does not want to hear, there hear the Turk with his Koran, the red spirits and all devils, who preach all kinds of error: because it is the highest and greatest sin, so also the greatest and most severe punishment belongs to it.

(This § is in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, cap. 1. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 76.) 


12. the cause of sins. 


When Martin was asked, "Where does sin come from and what is the cause of it?" he said, "Holy Scripture shows that it comes from the devil, whom our parents obeyed against God's word, disobeyed God, and thereby fell into terrible punishment. For through the same sin, not only are our bodies so weakened that they have become mortal from immortal, but the mind, heart, spirit and will have been destroyed. 


Cap. 9: Of sin. § 6-16. 


365 


is utterly depraved and wicked. For man has lost the right true knowledge of God; so the will is so utterly depraved that it desires and wants nothing, for that is evil, which is, as Paul says, "hostile to the law of God," and takes pleasure in sin, yes, is an "enmity against God, and is not subject to the law of God, for neither is he able," Rom. 8:7. 


13. the punishment of sins. 

The punishment of sin is death, both temporal and eternal, as St. Paul says Rom. 6, 23. Therefore it cannot be sweet, but bitter, because God says: "The day you eat of it, you shall die of death", Gen. 2, 17. 


14. what sin sorry, or not. (Cordatus No. 135.) 

Sinning against the Ten Commandments is tolerable, but sinning against the mercy of God is intolerable; but so sin those who persecute Christians for it, because they do not defend themselves or take revenge. 


15. the punishment of sins. (Lauterbach, Nov. 29, 1538, p. 182.) 

Then they spoke of the fierceness of the plague, which killed people by very short attacks, and at that time three people died in two houses in Wittenberg. Luther said: Punishment follows sin, as Paul says to the Corinthians (I. 11, 30.): "That is why there are so many weak and sick among you, and a good portion sleep." It will certainly have been a good distemper. So also Paul says 2 Cor. 13, (3.): "Forasmuch as ye seek to know him that speaketh in me, even Christ." So also the extraordinary sins of ungodliness and ingratitude will provoke God's utmost wrath. 


16. difference of the Pharisees and tax collectors sin. (Cordatus No. 1344.) Christ knew best how to distinguish between sins. That is why he hates the envy of the Pharisees very much and punishes it severely. 


366 


But to the Magdalene he proves to be kind and friendly. Those do not want the word, this one seizes it. Let us be sinners, and only not envious. 


Let no one despair because of his sins. 


Because of our sins, that we are great sinners, we shall not despair nor despair. For God, who has publicly proclaimed the forgiveness of sins to all who recognize and confess them from the heart and has offered it to everyone, excluding no one, will not be otherwise minded, but remains true to His word forever and ever, and keeps faith. 


18, example that God forgives sin. 


We must not make or think ourselves more pious nor more pure than the avenger and murderer was on the cross before conversion. And if the apostles had not thus fallen, | believe that the forgiveness of sins would not be believed. Therefore, when it comes to the reckoning, | say: Dear Mr. Peter, | have not denied Christ my Lord as you have done, even though | am a great sinner. So the forgiveness of sins remains. 

Even though the apostles were sinners, the Lord Christ always excused them, as when they plucked up the ears, Matth. 12, 1. ff. But he vexes the Pharisees with the giving of interest, as he has always been almost sharp and mocking against them. And he always comforts the disciples, as Peter, when he says: "Do not be afraid, you will see men again", Luc. 5, 10. 


19. God does not leave unpunished any sin that is not recognized and confessed, especially in the first table, which is not considered sin but virtue. 

(Cordatus No. 1743. 1745. 1) 

The judgment of God is revealed and certain, that he who does not believe will be condemned. Accordingly, we too can condemn the ungodly, such as Zwingli, David his son Ab-

salon, when he says: Oh my son Absalon! because he knew that he had died in public turmoil, and because he had defiled his father's bed. [Ps. 58, 12: "God is still judge on earth", that is, no evil goes unpunished. 

Let God make me fall into all sin, only not into that which | do not recognize for sin; for nothing offends God more than when one does not want to have sinned, like Saul. But there are sins that are not recognized against the first table, others are against the second. Some are restored to repentance by preaching, like David. But when they say [Deut. 29:19]: ["It is well with me, because | walk according to my heart"; "That the drunken woman may go with the thirsty"; likewise Num. 16: "Is this his spirit? 


20. the fall of the wicked, and how they are taken in their ungodly nature and false doctrine. (Cordatus No. 1746. 1757.) 

Our Lord God catches the wicked when they are most secure, and in the most trivial matters, like the pope through indulgences. 

What falls from heaven is diabolical, what stumbles on earth is human.

368 Cap. 9: Of sin. § 24-30. 369 this answer: You want to be without sin, and yet have no right sin. Christ is the forgiveness of righteous sins, as murdering parents, blaspheming publicly, despising God, breaking marriage 2c., these are the righteous sins. You must have a register, in which righteous sins are written, if Christ is to help you: you must not deal with such pile-up work and puppet sins, and make a sin out of every bombardment. 


Forgiveness of sins is in all ranks and offices. 


(The first sentence Cap. 7, § 171; the rest contained in Cap. 2, § 24.) 


Forgiveness of sin must be above everything by all means.

If they make unjust judgments, and the devil torments them in conscience, they could not resist him, even if they had Bartholum, Balduin and all the scribes for themselves: but with the érreiyeia, that is, with the forgiveness of sins, they may protect themselves. They must "strike first" and hit what they can, and then say to our Lord God: "Dear Lord God, let it go like this, we can't do better; if it is wrong, forgive it. Because it is not possible to do justice, mathematicum; therefore no jurist, even in the very best conclusion, can stand against the devil, if he does not take theologiam to his aid, so that he comes and says: Dear Lord God, | have given a judgment in this matter, it is our rule so; if it is not right, forgive it. And this a jurist must do also in civil matters, not only in spiritual ones; because they cannot meet punctum mathematicum, or the actual law. 

But a theologian must have it and be sure to say: It is written in God's word, and nowhere else. This the jurists cannot do; they do as the uncertain organists do: when they strike on an organ, if one pipe does not agree rightly, they take the others; if one voice is not right, the other is right. But theology meets the punctum mathematicum, which says: There is one righteousness, which is Jesus Christ; he that believeth on him is righteous. Of Christ we theologians preach and say: This our doctrine is right; so also say the prophets, Isaiah and Jeremiah. We do not want to have forgiveness of sins, because the teaching is not mine, but God's; as the Lord Christ also says: "The words | speak are not mine, but my Father's", Joh. 14, 10.

The trees do not all grow straight, the waters do not all flow straight, nor is the earth the same in all places.

374 Cap. 9. of sin. § 41 is only about the righteous after the fall, or about the holy ten commandments, not about the commandment [Gen. 2, 16. 17.], which was given to Adam in paradise. 


42 Recognition of sin. (Cordatus No. 1318.) 

This is the highest impiety of the world, that it does not want to believe that it is God who justifies, and all men ascribe righteousness to themselves, and no one wants to confess what God Himself obviously says about all; for when He says: God justifies the impious, He calls us all arch-villains. For what does the wicked not dare to do? Everything, if he has the opportunity. He who has not done the evil that another has done, has done something that the other has never done. No one is pure, but confession is lacking. What is done is done. He who has stolen, let him steal no more. [Eph. 4, 28.] 


43. sins are distinguished. (Cordatus No. 1319.) 

Crimes in office [publica crimina] are much more serious than those committed by private individuals. For what is a thief who is hanged compared to the sins that H[archduke] G[eorg] commits? Every day he kills many souls, and yet he wants to be just. 


44, sin must be confessed. 


Magister Paul, 1) who had secretly given his stepson to a farmer in the Mark, and had a dead carcass put into a coffin and publicly buried in Wittenberg, as if the child had died, because of which he was also imprisoned and lay in the tower; he sent D. M. Luther a psalm that he had made, and wrote to him next to it that he wanted to pray for him that he might be set free again. Then the doctor said, "Oh, dear Lord God, how | would like you to be free; but your loose, useless excuse will disgrace you, for the circumstances are too important, great and much; over and above that which accuses you, you will be disgraced.

also the deed and the work itself. It would be better to confess the sin and ask for mercy and relief from punishment; for confession of sin and_ iniquity deserves and obtains mercy, not only from God, but also from people, who have mercy on the one who confesses it. But it is lazy to confess one's sin, and one is ashamed of it. 


So David did: after he had committed adultery, he kept silent for a whole year, as if nothing mattered to him, although his heart would often have told him and he would have felt it; but he did not heed it. The nature and manner of sin is that it makes a man dumb, then Satan comes along and makes him completely obdurate. So he goes in impenitence, where God does not reveal sin to him through the law, so that he feels his wrath against sin, and in turn, he is corrected and comforted through the gospel. Oh, rather let us confess and repent; for we have a gracious God who does not let us lack Him; He will gladly forgive if we only recognize and confess it. 


No evil-doer goes unpunished. (Contained in Cap. 9, § 19.)

Great saints have also been sinners. (Cordatus No. 653.) 

Let David be a great example of divine mercy; he tore a lion in two and slew a devil on Goliath. He had God's testimony about this, and then he fell over two pigtails; fie on you, and he became a murderer and hopeful. | think that he has come out of it. He was almost the greatest of all the saints, with the exception of the Baptist, after him is Elijah. | mean, Moses, Aaron and his sister also became detached. But when God said [Deut. 32, 51]: "Because you did not sanctify me at the Haderwaffer", if he had not taken the forgiveness of sins, he would have died immediately and been condemned. 


376 Cap. 9. of sin. § 48-53. 377 


48. difference of the punishments and cause of the sin punishment. 


They talked about the causes of the punishment, which is done out of God's justice; partly through the authorities, partly also through various plagues and misfortunes, but also both through repentance, that one corrects oneself, and through the gospel. Then said Doct. Martinus said: "The punishments are very unequal, one is greater and more severe than the other. It is a godless opinion and delusion of those who pretend that all sins are equal, as Sebastian Frank teaches. St. Paul's sin is much different than Neroni's. 


49. from original sin. 


These thoughts of Erasmi's are the greatest and most dangerous torture and challenge, for he thinks that God is unjust when the pious are wronged. For if God were just, he thinks, and ruled according to justice here on earth, giving to each one as he deserved; then it would not be evil for the pious, nor good for the wicked. This is an epicurean and godless delusion and thought, which comes from the fact that they think that nature is neither mad nor corrupt. They do not see that our knowledge, reason, understanding, will, powers, inwardly and outwardly, in body and soul, are completely evil and corrupted by original sin; therefore they think that God is such a man as they and their bewitched eyes think. They all have blue spectacles before their eyes, and through them they also look at God as if He were such, and cannot look at Him otherwise. For they do not see what great misfortune and evil original sin has caused us, and how it has corrupted our judgment, knowledge, understanding and senses. Reason thinks that this alone is original sin, that one has evil desire and disorderly lust for the female sex. That is why all scribes and scholastic theologians say that carnal lust and desire are original sin; but unbelief, hopefulness of heart, despising God, scorn, blasphemy, murmuring against Him when things go bad, they know and understand nothing about it, nor do they consider it a sin. 


50. blasphemy sin. (Cordatus No. 479.) 


Whoever the devil says that Christ is not merciful to him, makes God a liar who points us all to Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and this is to answer him: Even if |am a sinner, Christ is righteous. 


51. sin grows and takes over. 


In the 86th year of Abraham's age Ishmael was born to him, and before he was 99 years old Sodom and Gomorrah perished. So soon sin increased and prevailed in the five cities. Just as with us man's wickedness has grown and risen so high in such a short time that | believe the world will not be able to endure beyond five or six years. Sodom and Gomorrah perished in the 488th year after the flood. | am telling you this terrible story so that you may learn the right use of it, namely, to frighten those who are hopeful, proud and presumptuous in their hearts. 


52. sinners should not despair. 


Therefore let him who has fallen into sin not despair, but amend, repent, and cease from sin, and let him do it no more. Judas, in betraying Christ, committed a great sin, but not unto death; whereupon he repented, and was not restored by faith, and the sin grew greater and greater, and followed that he despaired. 


53. how sin is forgiven. 


First, sin is forgiven, not that it is no longer present or felt, but that it is not imputed. Secondly, the law is fulfilled, not that enough of us is done for it, but that we are forgiven for what we cannot do; 1) for the righteousness of our works has heartache. In the article of forgiveness of sins is the knowledge of Christ, which alone can comfort and raise up: without this | can

through sin, so that the world becomes too narrow for me; only the knowledge of Christ raises me up again and sustains me. 


54 Of original sin in Christians. 


Original sin, after baptism, is like a wound that begins to heal. It is a real wound, but it is healed, and is in constant use and practice of healing, even though it still festers, hurts and aches. Thus, although original sin remains in the baptized until we die, it is killed daily and without interruption; its head is removed so that it cannot condemn and accuse us Christians. 

At Eisleben, M. Luther said to Doct. Jonas, when a barber cut off his hair and took off his beard, that original sin in man was like a man's beard; which, even if it were cut off today, so that one would be smooth around the mouth, nevertheless the beard would grow again in the morning. Such growth of hair and beard did not cease while a man lived, but when one strikes it with a shovel, it ceases. So original sin also remains in us and stirs while we live, but it must be resisted and such hair must always be cut off. 


Original sin corrupts everything. 


Anno 1541 D. Luther said of the original sin: We would have a blessed life, if the Venenum originale, the original sin, were not, the Vritis sieut Dii: You will be like God, Gen. 3, 5. Our Lord God says: Do what | command you and let me rule; so we want to be gods and want to rule. Then we are well able to do it, and so we direct it that all misfortune and heartache come upon us. 


56. to sin willfully. 1) 


To err and sin is still okay, but to want to sin willfully, knowingly and deliberately is too much. 


1) Cf. Cap. 13, § 51 the beginning of the fourth paragraph. 


who offended him. 


Luther answered and said, "No, for Christ neither did this himself nor commanded it. It is enough if he forgives him in his heart, and if he is asked, forgives the guilt, and does not desire revenge or punishment, but asks for him. | once also wanted to ask some who had offended me, as M. E[isleben] and D. H. S[churf]; it happened that none of them was at home, and | refrained from doing so. Therefore, | now thank God that it did not happen. 

Then one of them said, "Is there anyone so pious among those who are offended that he does not bear the words of reproach and abuse with impatience and does not hate the one who offends him? Luther said: "If someone does wrong, he must also confess it; but should | not remember what is public, what Carlstadt, Minzer and Grickel have done to me? Who would deny it to me? | have done them no harm, but all good. 


Zedermann seeks his own benefit, because nature is corrupt. 


All natural inclinations are either against God, or without God; therefore none are good. | prove it thus: For all the affections, desires, motions and inclinations of man are corrupt, as the Scripture says: All men are false and indebted to God, that is, the nature of man is evil. Experience also testifies to this; for we see that no one is so pious as to marry, to beget children alone, to love them, so that they may be brought up and taught in the right knowledge of God. No great hero has done great deeds for the sake of the common good, but out of a desire for honor, and is condemned for that reason. From this it follows that such natural innate desires and inclinations are evil? Are they evil? 

Luther answered: "It is true that such emotions and inclinations are evil, but God tolerates and suffers them, and allows them to exist in those who believe in Christ. Thus he creates a man from man's seed in his own image; through authority he makes peace, and pleases him with all these things, 


380 


like a carnival play, not for the sake of our worthiness, but for the sake of God's mercy and forgiveness. 


59, what is the soul of man. 


| would like to know what the soul of man is, because the body, when it is dead and the soul has gone out, is nothing else but a stone. | cannot understand it: we will not see it before what we were before the fall, because when we will see the opposite image. 


60. twofold case. 


Falling and sinning happen in two ways: First, out of weakness; this is forgiven if one recognizes it, confesses it, and abjures God. The other, out of stubbornness and stubbornness; this is not forgiven, if one recognizes it and is sorry for it. But that they which have fallen shall be received again into grace, if they repent, is proved by the examples of Adam, David, and St. Peter: for the Holy Ghost is given by the word. Therefore, if those who have fallen hear God's word and repent, they receive the Holy Spirit again: but those who do not hear it are lost, like Saul, Jude 2c. David asks that he not lose the Holy Spirit again, for he knew well what a great thing it 1) is; therefore he asks: "Do not take your Holy Spirit from me again", Ps. 51, 13. 


61. image of God's mercy. (Cordatus No. 77 and No. 78.) 


With mere words, God could not have brought His mercy so close to us, namely forgiveness of sins and all other things, so that He blesses us to believe them, if He did not also impress it upon us in great and strong examples by His word, first on Adam, then on others, such as David who broke marriage, Job who cursed, likewise Jeremiah and many others. 2) 

"Cursing" reads harder in German than in Hebrew. But it means only this much,

63. whether bad fornication is sin. (Cordatus No. 1501.) 

Since Paul says [1 Cor. 6:9] that both fornicators and adulterers will not possess the kingdom of God, it is strange that to this day people are found who ask whether simple fornication is a mortal sin. 4) Therefore, | answer such people that they may read for themselves what is written. But if they want me to be their judge, | certainly cannot judge differently from what the Scriptures say. 


64. from an evil getbifsen. 


D. M. Luther once said about the table that it was a tender weak thing around an evil conscience, because it could not save itself. As also the pagans said of it: Conscia mens pravi de se putat omnia dici: An evil conscience always draws to itself everything that is spoken. And D. Luther then told this story: Someone had entered a hostel and wanted to spend the night there, who would have liked to steal. As the guest and the innkeeper sat at the table, the light began to run because there had been a knot in the wick. The host pointed to the light with his hand and shouted: "Thief, thief! The guest, who was a thief, jumped up from the table, took hold of the words, and wanted to hit the innkeeper; his conscience drove him there. For if he had not been a thief, he would not have followed these words. 

Item, he said, "There was a preacher who scolded adulterers in the pulpit, saying, "I have long punished adulterers with words, and now I will punish them with deeds; for | know an adulterer among this multitude of my hearers, and | see him before my eyes, and know him so well that | will punish him also with 


3) Instead of "vol" in the original, "vel" will be read. 4) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. 1, 1225, z 60. 


382 


And he lifted up the stone, and stood as if to cast at the adulterer. Then there were one or twenty of them down under the pulpit, and they all cowered, and feared every one that he would throw at him, and would run out of the church. Then the priest said, "l wept that there were only one adulterer among you; so you should all be adulterers. That is what conscientia, conscience, does. Then he told the story of the woman who had stolen the brush: when she saw other women talking to each other, she did not think otherwise, because they were talking about her stolen brush 2c.

65. from a tender conscience. 


| think that if the apostles had lived at such a time as we are living now, when sin and vice are overflowing everything, their consciences would have been much too tender, they would not have been able to suffer it. But we have bear skins, wild boar skins; we do not feel it so hard. Whoever has a hard 1) skin over his heart, it might well break. Well, we may well pray and become pious.

This remark shows that Férstemann had no idea of how arbitrarily Aurifaber dealt with the pieces taken from Luther's own writings, apparently to make table speeches out of them. If he had known this, he would have approved and accepted Stangwald's statement without further ado. 


384 Cap. 10: Free will. § 4. 5. 385 


4. a different one from the free will. 


Oh, dear sirs, said D. M. Luther, why should we boast and say so much about our free will, as if it should also be able and do something in divine and spiritual matters, however little that may be? For if we were to look at it and consider it rightly, and were able to do so, what terrible misery the devil has wrought in us men through sin, which is innumerable and unspeakable; we would be ashamed to death; indeed, if we recognized it rightly, we would be frightened with great sorrow, fall down immediately and die. 

For first, he led us into original sin and brought death upon us. After that, not only death follows sin, but also all kinds of misfortune; as we experience daily that in the world there is all murder, lying, deception, stealing, robbery and other disgraces, vices and plagues; so that no one is safe for a moment, neither of his body nor of his goods, all of which is in danger. 

Over such misfortune is a greater one, as it is written in the Gospel, that the devil leads into men, possesses them, makes them mad and foolish; so that because of sin the human race is no different than a stinking, shameful, secret chamber of all devils. So shamefully has he brought us humans to ruin through sin that we could not have been more shamefully brought to ruin. For eternal death and God's wrath are upon our necks: after that we are never safe, and are afflicted in body and soul here on earth. Let this be a terrible, miserable and horrible devil's kingdom. 

Now what can such a corrupt and poisoned man, who is the devil's tool, even cloak, think of doing good, much less do that can please God, especially in divine and spiritual matters that affect our souls’ salvation? 1) In worldly matters, which concern body and goods and this temporal life, governing land and people, keeping house and the like, 2c. he can do something that has a semblance and appeal to God. 


1) See the 18th article of the Augsburg Confession. Likewise, the "Instruction of the Visitators," Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, 1667 f. 


But "everything that does not come from faith is sin," says St. Paul Rom. 14:23. 

But we do not yet know what we have become after the fall of our first parents and what we have brought with us from our mother's womb; namely, a nature that is completely crazy, corrupt and poisoned in body and soul and in all its powers. There is nothing good about it, as the Scripture says. 2) And this is my final opinion, as can be seen in all my writings, especially against Erasmum Roterodamum, the most distinguished of all scholars in the world. Whoever wants to deny man's free will, that he is able to do something in spiritual things and can contribute, even in the slightest, has denied Christ. | stand by this, and know that it is the certain truth. Even if the whole world were against it and decided otherwise, the decree of the high divine majesty would remain in force against all the gates of 


hell. (The following up to the end of § is from the house postilion, sermon on 4 Sonnt, according to Epiphania, Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. XIII, Col. 1623 f., § 15 and § 16.) 


5, whether the will of man in conversion and justification also does and works something for it? 


One spoke to D. Martin: "Doctor, some new theologians claim that the Holy Spirit does not work in those who resist Him, but only in those who will and give their will to it, therefore man's will is also a cause and contributor to faith. From this it follows that not only does faith justify, nor does the Holy Spirit work through the word alone, but our will also does something to it. Luther answered and said: "By no means, the will of man works and does nothing everywhere in his conversion. 


2) Aurifaber's remark: There you see, dear Christian, that what some, especially the synergists, chatter and pretend is a lie, as if the dear man of God had changed and softened his hard opinion of free will, as they baptize it, because it is straight against their error. Still, they boast of D. Luther's discrepancies. Yes, behind them. 


386 Cap. 10: Of free will. § 5-8. 387 


and _ justification. Non est efficiens causa In our conversion and justification before God, we do Justificationis, sed materialis tantum, but suffers only nothing inwardly, nor do we work with our powers and and is the materia in which the Holy Spirit works (as a free will, not even the smallest thing, but only suffer, potter makes a pot out of clay), even in those who and allow the Holy Spirit to shape and create us 


resist and are recalcitrant, as in Paul. But after he (the Holy Spirit) has worked in such a resisting will, then he also makes and creates that the will cooperates and agrees with him. 

Against this he said: St. Paul's example is a special 


through the Word, as a potter does his clay. 

The sayings in the Holy Scriptures about failure (such as: "No one can come to me unless the Father draws him", John 6:44) can be seen as if they deter us. But it is not so: for they only show us that with our 


work of God before others, since he was converted, powers we can do nothing, nor are we able to do therefore it cannot be taken for a common rule that it| anything good before God, and remind the godly that must also be kept with all others. Luther replied: "Just! they pray; if they do so, they are provided. 


as St. Paul was converted, so the others will also be converted at all times: for we all resist God, but the Holy Spirit draws us men, if He wills, in His time, through the ministry of preaching, therefore the oral word should always be held in high esteem and heard; for those who despise the oral word soon become heretics. 

But here one should diligently distinguish the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes the word is preached orally, and yet the Holy Spirit does not work immediately: for this reason one should not despise it, but always hear it with pleasure outwardly; God will work well through it in his time. In the meantime, he moves the hearts inwardly and blows where he wants, works and makes the word in the heart strong and active, if it pleases him, but not because of the ministry of preaching, which God wants to have unnoticed. For God has decreed that no one should believe, nor can believe, except through the ministry of preaching, that one may hear His word, for this is the instrument and the tube through which God the Holy Spirit stirs the heart, awakens and works true repentance and sorrow in conversion and right faith. 

Just as no one can beget children, with God and honor, except in the state of marriage; although not al married couples have children, but it is God's work alone, as the 127th Psalm, v. 3, says: "Children are a gift of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is a gift": so the Holy Spirit does not always work through the word, but when it pleases Him. That we therefore

8, the name free will is hostile. (Lauterbach, Jan. 10, 1538. p. 7.r) 


The third question: whether man has a free will? Luther answered: "This name, free will, was very detestable to all the fathers, although they and we admit" that God gave man a free will. But here the question is whether that freedom is within our powers. It should be called a fickle, changeable will, because God works in us and we act in a passive way, as the potter can make a vessel out of the same mass "for honor" or for dishonor. Thus our free will is suffering,

1) This § follows Cap. 36, § 1. 


388 


9. another, of the incapacity of human will. 


Is it not a miserable pity, said D. M. Luther, that a man should not be able to do so much? When God Himself beckons to him and says: "Dear one, you have two ways before you; take and choose one, Sir. 15:15 ff. Wouldst thou rather have my grace and eternal blessedness given and carried home in vain, without all thy cost and labor; or stand to gain it by thy works, and yet not obtain it? Yea, exhort and entice unto grace, and against it with everlasting wrath and punishment, if we accept it not. 

How should or can he do more, if he does not help anyone, that he offers his mercy so abundantly, irritates and gives, admonishes and admonishes, punishes and strikes? He himself would gladly let go of justice and put a stop to it, so we want to have justice without mercy, and yet also have our own idol with us. 


10. man for himself. 


Dear one, how shall he know how to govern who knows nothing of God, who was conceived and born in sins (as we all are) and is by nature a child of wrath and an enemy of God? Eph. 2, 3. How shall we find the right way and stay on it, if we can do nothing else, as the prophet Isaiah says Cap. 53, 6. but walk astray? How is it possible that we should resist the devil (who is a prince and god of this world, and of whom we are all prisoners), since we are not able with our strength and power to do so much that only a small leaf would not hurt us, or even that we could forbid a powerless fly? What do we poor miserable people want to boast of great comfort, help and counsel against God's judgments, God's wrath and eternal death, when we experience every day and every hour in ourselves and others how we can neither advise, help nor seek comfort in small, physical hardships? 

Therefore, only shoot freely: As little as a natural sheep can help him in the very least, but must be bad of all good deeds. 


Cap. 10: Free will. § 9. 10. 


389 


Much less can a man govern himself, find comfort, help and counsel in matters concerning salvation, but must rely on God, his shepherd, alone, who is a thousand times more willing and diligent to do whatever needs to be done for his sheep than any pious shepherd in the flesh. Item, because the nature of man is completely corrupted and condemned by original sin, from within and without, in body and soul, and flees from God when it feels its sin rightly: where then remains free will and human powers? Where then are the laws of man and the preachers of works who speak to man? Do your best: we must also do our part; send yourself to the grace of God, and you will become a child of blessedness. Yes, we are unprepared and unskilled with our abilities, powers and works: when it comes to the meeting, it does not hold the sting. 

How should one reconcile himself to God, whom he does not like to hear, flee from Him to a man, be more faithful and loving to a sinner than to God? What a fine reconciliation is this? Just as the children of Israel did at Mount Sinai, when God gave them the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:18. This indicates that nature and free will cannot stand before God, for they are afraid that He will strike them with clubs, and consider Him to be nothing but a devil, an executioner and a bully, who can do nothing but rage. Oh, he who has nothing more than free will and good works, let him go to hell, he will gain nothing, it must be something greater than our holy life. 

Therefore | say that the spiritual powers are not only corrupt, but also completely destroyed by sin, both in men and devils; so that there is nothing else but a corrupt mind, and such a will, which is indeed hostile and contrary to God, which neither thinks nor strives for anything else, but only for that which is contrary and contrary to God. It is true, and | also admit it, that the natural forces in man are still somewhat uncorrupted. But what are these natural forces? Namely, that man, who otherwise would be in the 


390 


ungodly being was drowned and became the devil's own, but nevertheless has a will, reason, free will and power to govern the house and the world; item, to govern ships and other such things, which are subject to man without God, Gen. 1, 28. 29. For such natural works and powers are not withdrawn from man, as there are, to beget children, to have government and authority, to keep house 2c., although God by His omnipotence must also be involved; but are much more confirmed by the Word of God, as is written in the above-mentioned place. But the sophists have drawn it into the spiritual realm and being, and may well have found something of it in the dear fathers; but the Romanists, who have less sense than horses and mouths, have drawn it into these spiritual things, and thus mixed spiritual and worldly things together. 

Therefore it behooves us to sweep out such filth as the sophists have brought into the church, and to put aside and get out of the way such vexations. We allow that such sayings are true and right, as long as they are understood and interpreted as they belong, namely in this temporal and physical world kingdom. But if one wants to draw them into the spiritual realm, where one has to do with God and before God for the sake of one's conscience, then we say no to that, because there is nothing pure or good about us, but what we are and have is all drowned in sins. Everything that is in our will is evil, and everything that is in our mind is only vain error and blindness. Therefore man has and does nothing else in divine matters, but vain darkness, error, wickedness, perverse evil will and lack of understanding: what then can he do good, love God? 2c. 


Cap. 10: Of free will. § 10-12. 


391 


11. most terrible wrath of God, when he weighs down our will and takes his word. 


Alas! said D. M. Luther, how could there be greater wrath, than when God lets us go according to our conceit, mind and will, takes away his word, that he no longer punishes and lets men, yes, the devil himself be our master? What else can there be but dissension and disunity of doctrine, whereupon from disunity of doctrine follows also outward disunity, strife and sedition; as it was said in Joseph's time, how abominable dissension and sedition were among the Jewish people, hard before the birth of Christ. What is much praised about free will and human powers, about the natural light of reason? What is it but blindness and darkness? What can it be better than fencing against faith and God's word? 

| therefore reject and condemn as vain error all doctrine that praises our free will, as it strives against the help and grace of our Savior Jesus Christ. For since apart from Christ, death and sin are our lords, and the devil is our God and prince, there can be no strength nor power, no wit nor understanding, that we might send or strive for righteousness and life; but must be blinded and captive, belonging to the devil and sins, to do and think what they please, and contrary to God with his commandments. Well, that may be a fine freedom for me. 


12. right doctrine of free will against God.

The catechism must remain. (Cordatus No. 486.) 

"You are a priest forever" [Ps. 110, 4]. He wants to remain a priest, even if the papists do not want to. He has already fought two battles, against Muenzer and Zwingli, both of whom they call martyrs, and our catechism will prevail. 


2. the catechism is necessary in the church, especially for the children. (Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, p. 82.) 

After that, it was said that in Pomerania the [catechism] examinations were neglected in schools, homes and churches. Luther said: "Oh, the sermons in the church do not edify the youth, but the interrogation of the catechism in the home, the explanation and interrogation at confession is very effective. This is burdensome, but necessary. The papists have fled these discomforts, have to think only with the interest register. And so the army of Christ and the church have been neglected. 


The Catechism is the best and most necessary teaching in the church. (Lauterbach, May 26, 1538, p. 85.) Luther: My advice is that one should not disputire about hidden things, but should be a

stay in God's Word, especially in the Catechismo, because in it you have the most correct way of the whole religion. For God Himself has given the Ten Commandments, Christ Himself has prescribed the Lord's Prayer, the Holy Spirit has set the articles of faith in the most correct way. These three things are so arranged that they could not be putin a finer, more comforting and shorter way: but people despise it because it is a small thing, because boys and little children recite it every day. 


4. a different. (Cordatus No. 694.) 


The Catechism is always to be preached as the most perfect doctrine. | wanted to preach it daily and read from the book, but our preachers and listeners know it so well [ad unguem] that some are annoyed to preach it, and others, hearing it, are ashamed of this little teaching and strive to be seen, and when they hear the peasants and noblemen say: Our pastor always fiddles on one string, 1) they seek better and higher things.

394 Cap. 11 Of the sacred catechism. § 5-7. 395 


5 Des Catechismi Summa und Anhalt. 


1) The Catechism is the true layman's Bible, in which the entire content of Christian doctrine is comprehended, so that every Christian needs to know it for salvation. As the Song of Solomon is called a song about all songs, Canticum Canticorum; so the Ten Commandments are God's  Doctrina Doctrinarum, a teaching about all teachings, from which God's will is discerned, what God wants from us, and what we lack. 


On the other hand, the symbol or confession of faith in God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is 2c, Historia Historiar'um, a history above all histories, or the supreme history, in which the immeasurable marvels of the divine majesty are presented to us from the beginning to eternity, how we and all creatures were created by God; how we are redeemed by the Son of God (through His incarnation, suffering, death and resurrection); how we are also rejuvenated by the Holy Spirit, sanctified and made a new creature, and all together, gathered into one people of God, have forgiveness of sin, and are eternally saved. 


Third, Oratio Dominica, the Lord's Prayer, is an Oratio Orationum, a prayer above all prayers, the most exalted prayer, which the most exalted Master taught, and in which he comprehended all spiritual and bodily distress, and is the most powerful consolation in all temptations, tribulations, and in the last hour. 


Fourth, the reverend sacraments are Ceremoniae Ceremoniarum, the highest ceremonies, which God Himself founded and instituted, and in them assures us of His graces. For this reason we should hold the Catechismum dear and valuable, and teach it diligently to the youth, for in it the right, old, true, pure, divine doctrine of the holy Christian Church is summarized; and what is contrary to it, consider it to be innovation and false doctrine and insanity, which has also lasted so long. 


1) This § seems to be only another, extensive redaction of Cordatus No. 1453, which we have communicated in the second paragraph of § 20 of this chapter. For the first paragraph, compare Cordatus No. 1714, in our second appendix. 


and as great a semblance and reputation as ever it wants, whether it be old or new; we should beware of this. 


The catechism is necessary in the church. 


Doct. Mart. Luther said about tables: "We must have baptism, the passion of Christ, the Lord's Prayer, faith and ten commandments, and the article of justification, how one should become pious, righteous and blessed before God in the church, otherwise it may be as it pleases. For the world does not want it; for if anyone has learned the faith, it should be me; but we see that the world does not believe, therefore it does not believe. And if the catechism would not help the preachers in any other way, it would still be good so that the common people would no longer fall for the ceremonies. In my youth and throughout my life, | did not hear the Ten Commandments or the Lord's Prayer preached. 


7. contempt of catechism will bring gruesome darkness and heresy. 


Future heresies will darken this light, for we have the Catechismum, praise God! pure in the pulpit, as it has not been in a thousand years. For from all the books of the fathers, one could not gather as much as is taught by God's grace now, in our times, in the little Catechismo. There have, indeed, been great eclipses, and Doct. Carlstadt was awarded a doctorate, since he had never seen the Bible. 2) | read the Bible alone in the monastery in Erfurt, then God wonderfully sent it, against all people's thoughts, that | had to go from Erfurt to Wittenberg, there | was well deposited, 3) and have now become a wonderful monk, who deposited the devil in Rome, the Pope, by God's grace; yes, not I, but God through me, his poor, weak instrument, which no emperor nor potentate could have done. Therefore, he can easily drive out and overthrow the Turk by some means. For the fact that the emperor is tempted to do something against us means something; his melancholy will be something.

Good. Perhaps he has seen and noticed the malice and impiety of the papists, which makes him angry that they are dragging out the concilium for so long. 


8. a different. 


Whoever is not satisfied with the Catechismo, when the Catechismum is preached, is being preached to by the devil, said D. Mart. Luther. 


9. the catechism must reign. 


(Here 13 lines are omitted because contained .in Cap. 1, § 14.) 


(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 484.) 


Opportunity makes a preacher. | cannot take my sermons from my own posts, | cannot let myself be bound by words, but | still preach the same content. The occasion of some person or private business gives me the content of the sermon, and my servants, who were once dear to me, were kept only so that they might answer me when they were asked how | had been, and [to see] whether they knew how to answer when they were asked. 

If | were younger, | would cut off a lot in my posts and make them shorter, because | have used too many words in them. No one can follow or achieve the same long speeches and chatter, nor is it suitable or rhyming at all times: everything must be adapted to the circumstances, but the catechism must remain and reign. 


10. of the ten commandments virtues and vices. (Cordatus nos. 1420-1424.) 


The Decalogue [the Ten Commandments] is a book which contains so perfectly the virtues against God and man, and the sins opposed to them, that none is equal to it in the world. 

The virtue of the first commandment is godliness, that is, fearing and believing in God. The sin, on the other hand, is ungodliness; of the second commandment, confession of doctrine and preaching, the sin of blasphemy; of the third, outward worship, which is useful for teaching, as hearing God's word. Of the 


Cap. 11 Of the sacred catechismo. § 7-11. 


397 


same the worship that shows our faith. The sin that opposes this is contempt for religion and the Word. 

The virtue contained in the fourth commandment is obedience to superiors, parents, and authorities, and it [virtue] is distributive justice [i.e., that we give everyone his due]. The opposite sin is sedition. The virtue of the fifth commandment is kindness, not anger, not seeking revenge, the sin is cruelty; of the sixth [virtue] is abstinence, not committing adultery; the sin is unchastity; of the seventh [virtue] is charity, the sin is covetousness, theft, fraud in trade and commerce. 

The virtue of the eighth is truth, not damaging the good reputation of anyone, the sin of impersonating evil; the ninth [virtue] is righteousness, the sin of covetousness; the virtue of the tenth is abstinence, the opposite sin contained therein, evil air. 

The ten commandments are to be interpreted and understood as commanding [affirmative], according to the words of 1 Tim. [1, 5.], "The principal sum of the commandment is love." So also, "Thou shalt love GOD thy LORD," 2c. [Matth. 22, 37.] 


Abuse of God's Name Against the Other Commandment. 


These words: "| am the Lord your God, you shall not have strange gods beside me"; item: "You shall not take the name of your God in vain"; they seemed to me to be futile, useless and ridiculous in the light of the Gospel. When | first read them, | thought: "Who doesn't know that? But now | see, praise God! what they want; yes, they are much more wonderful than all men can understand and reason out, they are who they want. Carlstadt, Zwingel, Pabst, and all the others, who talk a lot about them, do not believe in their hearts that they are true, so that they may remain true: In the name of God, all misfortune arises. | mean, the hordes and enthusiasts prove it honestly. If God's name were not misused in this way, things would be better on earth now; but because there is neither measure nor end to misuse, everything goes badly, as we see and experience. 


398 Cap. 11 Of the sacred catechism. § 12. 399 


How should one honor and take hold of God? 1) (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 366.) 

The first commandment teaches faith in the promises and fear because of the threats, and since God is known from his deeds, he adds the execution from Egypt, just as it is otherwise said that God raised Christ from the dead; through such things we grasp the true God. Here belongs what he says: Whoever sees me (my deeds and my works) sees also my Father. "Your God" is the one who helps you, who cares for you; but not the gods of the Gentiles, who have eyes and do not see. Promises have benefits, threats punishments, as is the downfall of the Egyptians; and "strong" to help and punish; "a zealot" who wraths the apostate. An example is Sanherib, who wanted to conquer Jerusalem with his power. Secondly, he is also a zealot against his own whom he loves, whom he helps, whom he comforts and protects. This seizes faith, but fear deals with it, lest we give offense. "He that visiteth" is a terrible threat, which is rightly to be impressed upon our souls, and reason fiercely contends against it; but since the law is passed in the parents, Ezek. 18, [v. 20. ff.], their children do not perish, and the promise which follows is beyond all human comprehension. "Thou shalt not make [any image nor likeness] unto thee" [Ex. 20:4], that is, | will not be worshipped in thy way. This is how our Philip interprets it, he believes it is the same thing and good. 2) 


1) This § follows, as with Cordatus, so also with Stangwald, after § 26 of this Cap. and begins there thus: So then we serve God the Lord with faith in His fear 2c. 


2) putat idem esse et bene quidem. Regarding these last words, I must confess that they are not clear to me. - This passage, according to the words of Cordatus: Thus our Philip interprets it, seems to be not by Luther, but by Phil. Melanchthon. Whether this number of the Cordatus is an excerpt from one of Melanchthon's writings, which is completely included here in the Table Talks, or whether the presentation in the Table Talks is an extension from the Cordatus, I am not able to determine. - In Rebenstock II, 40 a. and Bindseil II, 42, the above passage (in excerpts) forms the conclusion of a memorial to the preacher Johannes Mantel in Miihl 


3) With faith in his fear, for he says, "| am the LORD your GOD." If he is our God, he will take care of us, feed us, protect us, help us and save us. But the gods of the heathen have eyes and do not see, ears and do not hear; therefore the heathen and the Maulchristen do not believe that God cares for them, yes, they have no right God, but a deaf, blind God and idols. But we have a God who cares for us, hears us and helps us, and punishes the wicked; therefore we should believe and trust in him, and expect and hope for help from him, and also fear him, so that we do not anger or offend him. 

But he testifies that he cares for us, because he brings his people out of Egypt, protects and shields them. Although he is slow in doing so, and had well afflicted them before. But God is wont to do so, that is His way, that He may thus try us, test our faith, and finally snatch and deliver us from temptation and distress. It is also a horrible example of God's wrath that he destroyed all Egyptians at once. But the human heart is so hard and iron that it does not fear God, even though he punishes with great severity and cruelty. 

And here also other deeds of God are to be shown and told, that he fed his people in the desert and protected them from the enemies and fiery serpents; item, the calf servants were punished very severely, likewise those who doubted to take the promised land. These and many more countless examples, even in distant times, if we would only consider them, show us that God cares for mankind. But we pass by finely. 


hausen. Instead of the last words of Cordatus, which are incomprehensible to us, we find the following: "Thus Christ speaks to Philip, who asks him to show him the Father: When you look at Christ and his good deeds, you grasp the Father." Assuming now that the relation of Cordatus is the original and correct one, we see here that the Latin Table Talks made Philip the apostle Philip out of Philip Melanchthon and then also trimmed the text accordingly. - With regard to the last words of the Cordatus, it is also doubtful whether these are to be regarded as words of Luther or as words of the Cordatus. 

3) The first words of the following paragraph are to be regarded as an answer to the question contained in the heading of this §. 


400 Cap. 11 Of the sacred catechismo. § 12. 401

This "A zealot.” GOD is zealous in two ways: First, lis an atrocious word of doom, which should strike fear God, as a zealot, is angry with those who fall away jinto our hearts. But it is contrary to our reason, for we from him, become unfaithful and perjured, and prefer think it is wrong that the children and descendants creatures to him, trusting in the favor of great lords, lghould be punished for the sake of their fathers and relying on good friends, their power, works, wealth, forefathers, and that they should repay them.

even over the penitent children from time to time, for the sake of example, so that others may take offense at sins and be pious. 

"But do well and be merciful in a thousand" 2c. This is a great, glorious, comforting promise, which far surpasses all understanding of reason, which considers it neither right nor just that for the sake of a pious man many undeserving people should receive good. But one finds many examples that many people have benefited from a pious man. For Abraham's sake many people were preserved and blessed, as well as for Isaac's sake, and God did well and blessed the whole kingdom of Syria for Naaman's sake. 

But "to love God" means to believe and believe that God is favorable to us, that He helps us, assists us and does us good. Reason thinks that God does not ask anything about us, does not care for us. The fact that God burdens and burdens the human race with too many plagues and misfortunes is therefore hostile to God. Therefore, love comes from faith, and faith is required of us, because God promises everything good. 

"Thou shalt not have other gods before me, nor make thee any graven image. This is to be understood plainly, that this is the very God who has given this word to the world, and to honor him as he has commanded. For to have other gods and to make idols is to devise and set up new divine services, as those do who forsake the fear and faith of God and invent human gratification. So the summa of this commandment, as it is written in Moses Deut. 6:13: "Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him only." And in the 34th Psalm v. 6: "Those who wait for you will not be put to shame." The other commandment requires invocation of God's name in all afflictions, and thanksgiving; that is, to recognize and confess that we have received all good things from God. 1) 


1) This entire § is found in Bindseil's OoUoouia II, 244-246, but not in Rebenstock, which reinforces the assumption expresse above that this passage will not be by Luther, but by Melanchthon.

13. short sayings of the Catechismi, as D. Martinus Luther has taught him in his house. 2) 


The Ten Commandments of God. 


1. 


As faith is, so is God. God does not remain outside, even though he forgives. 

Despair makes monks and priests. God cares, 

but we are to work. God wants to have the heart 

alone. Idolatry is the idolatry of the heart. God 

gives through creatures. 


2. 


God's word presents the world to us, what a tender little fruit it is. 

One should celebrate for the sake of God's word. 3) 


3. God's Word is our sanctuary and makes all things holy. Works of obedience are to be greatly respected. 


4. 


All those who rule are called fathers. Fathers of souls are worthy of double honor. Authority does not belong in the fifth commandment. 


5. 


Anger is forbidden to everyone, without the authorities. All causes of death 4) are prohibited. 


6. 


Marriage is for everyone, 5) through all classes. 

Marriage is necessary and required. 

Marriage is forbidden and betrothed against God's commandment. 

Marriage is a blessed state and pleasing to God. 


2) This whole § seems to be a collection of aphorisms from Luther's writings, namely his sermons, with the exception of the few sayings we have proved from Cordatus. 

3) This spell is missing from Bindseil. 

4) Thus Bindseil II, 233 instead of "death". 

5) Thus Bindseil II, 233 instead of "before all". The meaning is: 


d all, in all estates, shall become eyelich. The unmarried state is 


godless. 


404 


7. To steal is to take wrongfully. Infidelity is also thievery. Thievery is the meanest food in the world. The great thieves are unpunished, as the pope with his own. Unfaithfulness and avarice do not prosper. 


8. 

Aftertalk is reaching into God's judgment. 

Judgment and malicious gossip belong to the authorities alone. 

No one should be judged and punished in the back. 

Everything should be interpreted for the best. 

No good work is apart from the commandments of GOD. 

9. 10. 


Fear and trust in God fulfills all commandments. The first commandment drives all the others. 


ten 


Faith. 


Faith teaches to know God and to know what kind of God we have. 

We must exercise faith in all kinds of cases. 

God gives Himself to us together with all creatures. 

The article of Jesus Christ should always be practiced. 

The Holy Spirit brings Christ home to us, who must reveal Him to us. 

Where the Holy Spirit does not preach, there is no church. 

The work of the Holy Spirit continues forever. 


The Lord's Prayer. 


To pray means to call upon God in distress, which is made deliciously good by God's command; and distress makes earnestness and devotion, which is our weapon against the devil. 

Devil, world and our flesh is against God's will. 

The devil hinders and spoils the daily bread and all the gifts of God. 

God cares for our bodies daily. 

No one can live in the world without sin. 


Cap. 11. of the sacred catechismo. § 13. 








405 


No one can bring his own piety before God. 

We must also forgive as GOD forgives us. 

Forgiving our neighbor makes us sure and certain that God has forgiven us. 

We are tempted in three ways, by the devil, the world, and our flesh. 

Contestation serves against the security of the flesh. 

Challenge is not overcome by one's own strength. 

The devil prevents everything we ask. 

The devil thinks he can get us into all kinds of trouble. 

Baptism. 

Faith is attached to baptism. 

Faith must have something external before it. 

Faith makes the person worthy. 

Baptism is not our work, but God's. 

Eternal life in body and soul is given through baptism. 

God confirms infant baptism by His Word. 

Baptism is right, although no one believes. No one 

should rely on his faith. 

Unbelief does not weaken God's word. Baptism is 

a daily dress of Christians. 


Communion. 

The Sacrament of the Altar is God's order. 

The word makes a sacrament. 

Without the Word, it's all bread and wine. 

The Sacrament is the food of the soul. 

Forgiveness of sins comes through the Word alone. 

Faith receives forgiveness of sins. 

Those who express themselves of the Sacrament are not Christians. 

The sacraments are not in our worthiness. 

Faith and natural reason are contrary to each other. 

Faith hangs on the Word. 

As one holds Christ, so one has him. Faith is the 

wealth of Christians. 

The gospel is God's power. 


406 Cap. 11. of the sacred catechismo. § 13. 407 


Good works. (Following set Cordatus No. 1730.) 


Good works have no name. 

The Christian's works are the neighbor's benefit and piety. 

Faith in Christ cancels sin. 

The holy scripture only comforts, not bequeaths good works. 

Christ is a common good. 

Christians ask and desire the last day. 

The church hears no one but Christ alone. 

Christ is of a low estate and standing. 

In tribulations one should be manly and courageous. 

Our whole life is to be manly, fearing and trusting God. 

Faith makes us the inheritance of Christ. 

Drawing Christ into the flesh is very comforting. 

We should seek heavenly glory and not look at human contempt. 

Christ gives birth to us out of pure grace through the Word. 

Gospel is vain joy. 

Grace condemns all own justice. 

Bliss is given and acquired to us entirely without our merit. 

Baptism gives us blessedness completely. 

Faith is the renewal of the mind. 

The rebirth is the work of the Holy Spirit alone. 

Reason and nature cannot comprehend nor understand God's goods. 


(Following sentence Cordatus No. 1748.) 


[Good works are evidences of faith; for as a letter needs a seal, so faith needs works. 

Faith looks at the word, not at the preachers. 

The speaker and the word are two persons. 

Natural life is a little piece of eternal life. 

Own conceit spoils all things. 

The Gospel comes from God, shows Christ, and demands faith. 

Gospel is a light in the world that enlightens people and makes them children of God. 


(Subsequent paragraph Cordatus No. 1749.) 


A godless preacher is worse than a virgin abuser. Challenges make a good preacher. 

Righteousness is obtained by faith and not by works; stand firm in the faith. 

A prince is a game in heaven. 

The person must be good before the works. 

We must be undaunted, believe and call. 

No stand is valid to make pious before God. 

Faith does not suffer human statutes in the conscience. 

The saints have often erred as people; offices should be separated from the person. 

Punishment is hated, but sin is loved. 

God sustains the saints even in the midst of error. 

No great saint has lived without error. 

A Christian life consists of three parts: faith, love and the cross. 

Christians are not given anything, but they are admonished. 

We must break our mind and will. 

(Following sentence to "angry" Cordatus No. 1750.) 

Love ‘curses not, but faith. For since it makes children of God, it punishes and wraths. For this reason all vengeance is abolished among Christians, who are to grow and increase in the fruits of the Spirit, among whom love is greatest, for it deals with people. 

Forgiveness of sin is a fruit of the Sacrament. 

Reason does not yet understand that Christ is our brother. 

Christ is given to me with all his goods and works. 

Christ comes to us through preaching, so he is in our midst. 

Without the cross, we do not come to glory. 

The gospel cannot be preached without rumor. 

The Holy Spirit does not make a person perfect as soon as, but he must grow and increase. 


1) This saying is missing in the Hall manuscript. 


408 


(Following set Cordatus No. 1751.) 

There is nothing to be lost in the Gospel, therefore one should put everything into it. 

Works belong to the neighbor, faith to God. 

Those who judge and condemn others condemn themselves. 

1) As faith is, so is good. 

Doubt is sin and eternal death. 


(Following paragraph Cordatus No. 1752.) 

To believe the Gospel is to refrain from sins. We owe works to our neighbor, but faith to God. A good work is that which benefits another. Then Christ is known when he breaks our bread, that is, the word in the heart gives faith through the Spirit. 

Faith means to build on God's mercy with certainty. 

Christ does not demand outward and seeming piety, nor hypocrisy and glitter, but piety of heart. 

It is by grace and mercy that we are saved, if we trust in it, but God must change hearts. 


(Following paragraph Cordatus No. 1753.) 

A parish priest is a Spittelmeister. The law is a mirror. 

Christ carries us on his back before the Father. 

Love does not look upon ingratitude. 

2) The sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing; as, dipping the infant in water or pouring it is a sign of baptism. 

Penance is a sacrament, and is repentance and sorrow, confession and absolution, and that is the definition of penance. 

Objectum Justitiae comes from the works, that is, justice has to do with the works, as this saying testifies Luc. 6, 37: "Forgive and you will be forgiven. Item Luc. 16, 9: "Make friends of the unfaithful. 


1) In Bindseil this saying is missing here, but is found instead of the first: As faith is, so is God. 

2) The following sayings, with the exception of the last "Christ will" 2c., which is found similarly in Cordatus No. 1202 (see App. IL), are all missing in the Hall manuscript and are possibly additions by Aurifaber.

right mammon." So the publican's breast beating is quite a prayer. 

The tree must be good before it bears good fruit. 

We should esteem God's goods, which we have, as great, but ourselves as small. 

Christ wants all men to be blessed, that is, he alone makes them all blessed, he alone is the light that enlightens all men. 

| want the catechism to be preached to the common people, which serves the people. And | shall use it in all my sermons, for it is the noblest and best doctrine. And | teach to the utmost of my ability, so that the common man, children and servants may understand, for the scholars know well beforehand that | do not preach to them. 


14, of the first three commandments of God. (Cordatus No. 1008-1011.) 

The first commandment is God Himself and the kingdom of His glory. The second is the kingdom of faith and the grace of Christ. The third has the provision of the Sabbath for the sake of the Word. The first has the kingdom of glory, the second the kingdom of grace through the Word. The first alone will remain, the others will cease. The second table belongs to the world regiment with the exception of the ninth and tenth. 

The first commandment is the most diligently acted by Moses, after that also by David, because the Psalms are nothing but concluding speeches [syllogismi] from the first commandment. The upper sentence is the word of God itself, the lower sentence [minof is faith, the conclusion [conclusio] is the deed and execution itself, so that it happens as we believe. 

If we believe the first commandment, we please God, and everything that is ours pleases God. If the first commandment is kept, the pleasing [placet] goes through all the other commandments and works. But he that hath not the first, his works all please God. 

"He who honors me honors the Father" [Joh. 5, 23.], that is, | am all that God is. What the Father is, does and suffers, that | am 2c. | and the Father are one. | do what God does, therefore | am the Father. 


410 


GOt. This is a reason from what follows [argumentum a posteriore], and what | suffer and what happens to me, that God suffers and that God happens. But this reason is not valid with the Jews. It is to them as when | strike an anvil with a straw. For they cannot suffer any cause whatsoever against them. For they cannot suffer anyone to say that even the uncircumcised are God's people. There are plenty of examples of this: the Ninivites, the king of Tyre. And that means to be obdurate. Therefore, it is useless to argue about big things with the Jews, because they do not even admit small, trivial things and stick to their opinions. 


(15) Upon the first commandment draw all things, and be comforted thereby. 


Oecolampadium has killed his conscience that he has said: This you have done; and has not been able to throw himself around again, that he would have said: Have you sinned? Admit it, but God is greater than our sin: | will not do a greater sin to this sin, than that | should deny Christ; but will cease to sin. How many subjects did King David have put to death before the city of Ai for the sake of a harlot, Bathsheba? Then our Lord God was silent about the fifth and sixth commandments, and was harsh about the first commandment alone, saying, "He has blasphemed God's name among the nations. What did Manasseh, the murderer of the prophets, do? He learned to speak: | have sinned. The king of Israel, Ahab, kept evil house with the prophets of God, and Elijah had to flee from him, otherwise he would have choked him away; yet he has refuge in God, that our Lord God says of him to Elijah, "Did you see how Ahab humbled himself before me?" 1 Kings 21:29. 

These are marvelous examples. The Bible cannot be studied, because one does not go back to the first commandment: we remain alone in the work, if one is to trace the works back to the first commandment, as the epistle to the Eberians does, when it says: Abel sacrificed in faith. We do not do this, but when we read something about sacrifice, we think of 


Cap. 11 Of the sacred catechismo. § 14-20. 


411 


we think that more had happened before. But Abel says: | have God as a friend, and then he sacrifices. Cain says: | do not know if | have a God. 


16. sin against the first commandment. (Contained in Cap. 9, § 19.) 


17. what the ten commandments of God are kept for in the world. (Contained in Cap. 12, § 83, sub. 1.) 


18) What the punishment of original sin is. 


The punishment of original sin is actually not knowing God and not knowing anything about him, which is blasphemy; then, not knowing one's neighbor, not respecting him, that is, doing him all harm, strangling and killing him. Third, not to know oneself, that is, to care for oneself, to wait for one's neighbor, and to seek one's own, even to the detriment of another. 


19. how to preach the ten commandments. (Contained in Cap. 11, § 10, last paragraph). 


20. of the order of the ten commandments. 


The first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh commandments are all in order. It is a greater sin to kill than to fornicate or commit adultery. It is more grievous to commit adultery than to steal. In the other three there is no order. Although | do not want to judge or conclude, | think that the three last commandments are like the width or circumstances of the first and previous commandments, that with the mouth and desires (for these two are forbidden in the last three commandments) one sins against the previous ones. But methinks this is the order: for bearing false witness is not so grievous a sin as coveting another's wife. Neither is it so grievous a sin to covet another's goods as to desire to have one's wife. 

(The following at Cordatus No. 1453.) 

One prayer above all prayers is the prayer of the Lord; one teaching above all teachings is the Decalogue [the holy ten commandments]; one virtue 


412 Cap. II Of the sacred catechismo. § 20-25. 413 


above all virtues is the Symbolum or faith. For as the Our Father asks and obtains in the best and most beautiful way, so the Decalogue teaches and admonishes in the best, most abundant and most beautiful way, and faith does and practices everything in the most abundant, best and most beautiful way. Thus this trinity makes man perfect and complete [absolutum] in thought, speech and action, that is, it forms the mind, speech and body and leads to the highest perfection. 


(Here 6 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 1, § 9. [Erl. ed. 57, 13. to end.]) 


21. brief content of the ten commandments of God. (Cordatus No. 164.) 


The first table teaches how we should act with God, but in such a way that the Gospel is also included. The second table contains the common life according to reason, which the philosophers who wrote about duties explained very well, namely the Academics, Peripatetics and Stoics, who all said that the highest good is virtue. If they differed somewhat in words, they agreed in substance. They have been able to speak eloquently of this life, which the second tablet teaches, because they alone hold the definitions of the virtues. 


22. what reason understands in the ten commandments of god. (Contained in Cap. 12, § 83.) 


The first commandment of God. (Cordatus No. 189 and No. 190.) 


The first commandment in the holy ten commandments is a loud promise, and also the Jews themselves do not call it a commandment. But someone would like to say: The first commandment demands faith, therefore the law justifies, because faith justifies. The answer to this is: The commandment does not justify, but the promise, if it is believed. Some distinguish the faith commanded by the law and say that it is our work; but the faith that takes hold of Christ is God's gift and also his work. 





The law, if it were fulfilled, would make righteous, but it does not find anyone who fulfills it. And the Holy Spirit would also fulfill the law and make people righteous by fulfilling the law, but he too has not yet found anyone who would be capable of his work and grace in such a way. 


Why the Ten Commandments should always be taught. 


The ten commandments of God must always be preached, for our hearts are godless and weak, therefore they must be kept with the law, as ina dungeon and prison, until they come to the right knowledge of themselves and of God's wrath against sin, are frightened by it, humble themselves before God and crawl to the cross; then they are comforted with the gospel, which does not serve the crude, the secure and the hypocritical: as Christ says Matth. 11, 5: "The poor have the gospel preached to them"; and Matth. 9, 12: "The physician is not useful to the healthy, but to the sick. 

Therefore, the devil does not cease to challenge even the God-fearing, pious Christians daily, and to torment and provoke them to do against the Ten Commandments of God, especially against the first tablet. There the great devils, the military leaders, must be against us. But in the other table there is rage, killing, fornication, adultery, robbery, stealing, backbiting, slandering, etc., which the young devils, the party stallions, can do. 


25 From the Catechismo, printed at Augsburg. (Cordatus No. 1229-1231. 1) 

They [the Sacramentarians] feel that they are in error, but do not want to be regarded as such, and this is their main reason: no one is made better by the word which the Wittenbergers preach, so _ their doctrine is not true; but it is not enough to believe only the Gospel, but one must also leave one's wife, have nothing of one's own 2c., and so they turn back to their own righteousness and cannot 


1) In the old table speeches, these numbers were rearranged. We have restored the order. 


414 


distinguish between the seed that falls on the rock and that which falls on the good land. Nor do they distinguish between the tares and the wheat. They are very foolish because they want to judge the word or the seed from the fruits. The gospel is a power of God that saves all who believe in it. 

The Catechism of the Augsburgs does not agree with ours, because in the first commandment they present it as if the words of this gospel promise: | am the HErr, your GOtt, were a commandment. The gospel promises, the law commands and enjoins. Thus they very ungodly divide the Lord's Prayer into three parts or spiritual petitions, and the fourth petition, our daily bread, they put last. Christ did not know the order correctly. 

Bucer freely confessed that he did not believe that the word of God was that which was not received by men. Therefore, | answered him that the second commandment was not God's word, 


Cap. | |. Of the sacred catechismo. § 25-27. 


415 


because it would not be kept by the wicked, who do not believe that there is a God. Thus they are mocked by Satan in their wisdom. 


The mind and content of the first commandment. 


Fear God, do right, trust God and hope in His grace. One should fear God and trust God at the same time, not one after the other. Do not sin, for you may soon die. Do not despair even if you have sinned, for God is merciful, who gladly forgives sin out of pure grace, for Christ's sake, since it is only known and confessed from the heart 2c.

Anno 1524, Feria 2. post Judica, D. M. Luther said: Those, who praise Mosis court order, Judicialia, laws and rights in world affairs, so highly, are to be despised; because we have our described imperial and land laws, under which we live and to which we have committed ourselves. Just as neither Naaman the Syrian, nor Job, nor Joseph, nor Daniel, nor other sronim Jews kept Mosi's law nor used it outside their country, but the laws and rights of the Gentiles with whom they were. Mosiah's laws bound and obligated only the Jewish people in the place that God had chosen. Now they are free. Otherwise, since one would have to keep Mosi's judicialia, laws of court and world affairs, we would also have to be circumcised and keep the ceremonialia and Mosaic ceremonies; for there is no difference: whoever considers one as necessary, must also keep the others. Therefore be content with Mosi's laws;

2. the law most terrifies the godly. 


God puts the sword into the hand of the emperor, who then puts it into the hand of the judge and lets him punish thieves and murderers, and then takes it out of his hand again if he wants. This is what God does with the law; he lets the devil have his way, so that he can frighten the sinners. But that the godly and pious Christians are most of all tormented, vexed and martyred by it, the game is for the last day; not for the pope alone, but for the whole world. The devil senses the end of his kingdom, therefore he wriggles. Let us therefore be confident, strong and joyful in the Lord. Let us be armed and girded with the sword of the Spirit, pray and call upon God in all troubles and afflictions, and wait either to be delivered from all evil, or to be punished.

Preaching that it is not necessary to keep the law for the sake of obtaining salvation appears to the Jews as it would appear to Christians if someone preached that Christ is not the Lamb of God who bears the sin of the world. 

The custom of the law is twofold. Paul could have patiently borne the free fulfillment (This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Of the law, but the Jews did not want that, just as little Galatians, Cap. 3. Walch, old edition, vol. VII, U 443, 444. as our papists, who definitely want their ceremonies 445. 447. 448. 449. 456. 457. 458. 459. 460, with several omissions and one rearrangement). to be held by the one who wants to be blessed.

The righteousness of the gospel is not understood by reason. (Cordatus No. 1017, the first paragraph.) 


If H[arch] G[eorg] sinned only against the gospel this would be a futile sin for him; but this sin cannot b forgiven him, that he sins against the known truth an drives people out of his states without cause. H understands only the righteousness of the law; th justification which is in Christ he understands not, no the Spirit; that is, [he understands only] th righteousness of the law, not the justification of faith o of the gospel, which few take hold of, for they want t know of their sins and their righteousness. 


The gospel is equal to the bfab mi in the musica. (Cordatus No. 1291.) 

In music, b fab m is the gospel, because it governs all the music, the other claves are the law, and as the law obeys the gospel, so d ka d mi governs the other voices, and mi is the law, ka the gospel. The second tone [secundus tonus] is weak due to sin, because in b ka b mi, wherever it is, it allows this [voice]: Mi or fa.

The righteousness of the law does not make one blessed. (Cordatus No. 1696.) 


Clouds that hasten but give no rain are the righteousness of the law, which promises much but gives nothing but hypocrisy. 


38. antitype of the law and the gospel, how both go from places. 


What is law does not go out from places, nor does it go out voluntarily from the hand, but is resisted and resisted, and is done unwillingly and with reluctance; but what is gospel goes out from places with pleasure and all will. Thus God has preached the gospel also through music; as one can read in the Josquini 2) Canto 


1) A sufficient explanation of the above has not yet been found. (Wrampelmeyer.) 2) Cf. cap. 13, § 62. 


428 


Seeing that all composition flows and goes out finely, cheerfully, willingly, mildly, and sweetly, is not forced nor compelled, and is bound to the rules strictly and straightforwardly, like the finch's song. 


The gospel does not require us to do any works. 


The gospel is a good message that brings a good new tale, that God's Son became man and died for us, and rose again from the dead 2c., is not a sermon about our works. Therefore, whoever says that the gospel requires works for salvation is a liar. 


40. works of the law are done with unwillingness. 


Doctor Martino brought his little daughter Magdalenichen, who was supposed to sing to her cousin N.: The pope calls emperors and kings 2c., but she would not do it, although her mother urged her to do so. Then the doctor said, "Nothing good comes from the works of the law unless grace is added to them: what one is forced to do does not come from the heart, nor is it pleasant; for under Moses alone one murmurs, and wants to stone him all over, but he is not favored. 


41. why the law repealed. 


That the law was abolished and taken away was as necessary (so that it could no longer condemn the faithful) as that it was instituted and given; namely, so that one would know that Christ had now come, of whom Moses 5. B. 18, 15. says that one should hear the same, because all the prophets said that then the law would cease. 


(42) One should not argue with the devil out of the law, but out of the gospel. (Contained in Cap. 26, §1.) 


The law must always be preached. 

Because our flesh is for and all weak, even evil and corrupt, through original sin, therefore the ten commandments of God must always be obeyed. 


Cap. 12: The Law and the Gospel. § 38-44. 





429 


preach. That the wicked may be kept and forced as in a prison, until they learn to know themselves aright, and feel that they are damned and lost in the wrath of God, with all their works and virtues, and so long for Christ, who alone can and will save from sin, death, the devil and hell, out of pure grace, all who believe in him. 1) 

The ungodly are not to be preached the gospel, for they abuse it to the lust of the flesh and become angry with it, but the law, that they may be terrified and humbled. 


44. the antinomer pretending not to preach the law. 


In 1541, M. Jobst 2) showed D. M. Luther over the table the propositions that one should not preach the law in the church, because it did not make one righteous. Luther was very angry about this and said: "This is what our people want to do while we are still alive. Mr. Eisleben is of this opinion; envy, hatred and ambition drive him to it. Oh, that we could give the honor to M. Philippo, who teaches clearly and differently about the use and custom of the law, and | also teach about it, and | have abundantly dealt with this in the epistle to the Galatians. Count Albrecht of Mansfeld's prophecy will come true, who wrote to me: "There is a coiner behind it; for he who abolishes the teaching of the law politically abolishes the teaching of the police and stewardship. And if the law is cast out of the church, there is no more knowledge of sins in the world; for the gospel does not punish sin, but uses for it the office of the law, which is spiritual and describes and reveals sin done contrary to God's will and commandments. He who pretends that the transgressors do not sin against the law, but rather dishonor the Son of God, is not to be heard; for such speculative theologians are a pestilence to the church, for they have no conscience nor true knowledge of the divine word, 


1) Cf. cap. 26, § 16. 2) Justus Menius. Bindseil I, 268. 


430 


they also teach without some dialectics, and throw everything into one another. They do the same as those who argue: Plenitudo legis est Dilectio: the fulfillment of the law is love, therefore we have no law. But these poor, unintelligent people do not see the minor point, 1) that this fulfillment, namely love, is quite weak in this flesh, and that through the spirit one must daily fight and contend against this weakness, and this weakness, because we live, must be under the law. 


Why the gospel is preached so clearly now. 


Now, in our time, the light of the gospel is a sure sign of the glorious future of the Lord Christ, and like the dawn that precedes the eternal day and the going forth of the Sun of Righteousness. 


46 The Gospel does not distinguish the persons. 


The law says: Every person is either a public person, who is in a public common office, or a private and individual person, who is in no office, who does not command the sword. To the private person it says: You shall not kill. But the gospel abolishes all distinction of persons, speaking badly in general: If you believe, you please God; as Christ says Joh. 3, 16: "So God loved the world, that everyone who believes in him has eternal life" 2c. and Marc. 16, 16: "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved." 


47, how to stand against the charge of the law. 


(This § is from the Hauspostille. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIII, Col. 2031 f., § 25. 26. 27. 28. 


48. the gospel will be starved. 


The fact that the pastors, preachers and ministers of the Gospel are so poor at the present time that some of them may pine away with their wives and children is due to the fact that peasants, noblemen, officials, castles, princes, all of them of the

The gospel brings poverty, but false teaching brings wealth. (Contained in Cap. 1, § 55.) 


50. blissful time. (Contained in Cap. 2, § 138.) 


51 Different effects of grace and the law. (The first paragraph is contained in Cap. 12, § 60, therefore omitted). (The following at Cordatus No. 340.) 


Difference of the law and the gospel. The law is the back of God, wrath, sin, weakness. The Gospel is His face, the grace of the Lord, perfection. Therefore, God says to Moses, "You will see my back, but not my face" [Ex. 33:23]. 


It is difficult to distinguish the law from the gospel. 


When one complained that he could not distinguish the Law from the Gospel, D. M. Luther said. M. Luther said, "Yes, if you could do that, you would be a good doctor. And he stood up, took off his beret, and said, If ye can do this, then will | say unto you, My dear Doctor, ye are learned 2c. Paul and | have never been able to get there. To St. Paul it was said, because he would have liked to be free of his thorn: Sufficit tibi gratia mea: Be content with my grace, 2 Cor. 12:9, that is, you have my word and command, keep it and be content with it. For if our Lord God gave us a strong, unwavering faith, we would become proud, despise Him, and boast about it ourselves. If he then gives us knowledge of the law, we become stupid and despondent, knowing nowhere to stay. Therefore, it is best that God play with us in such a way that we recognize our misery and suffering, and cling to the man called Christ with all our thoughts, who will certainly set right what we have ruined.

53. lies, 1) A lie is like a snowball, the longer you roll it, the bigger it gets. 


54. beware of sophistry. (Contained in Cap. 40, § 1.) 


55. from abthuung of the law. (Here 7 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 12, § 41.) 


D. M. Luther spoke a lot about the abolition of the law through Christ, referring to the saying Rom. 8, 3: "Which was impossible for the law, because it was weakened by the flesh, God sent His Son, who fulfills the law in us" 2c. God has redeemed us from the tyranny and obligation of the law, as Saint Paul says Rom. 10, 4: "Christ is the end of the law" 2c., that is, Christ is the summa and the right pure opinion and the content of the law; whoever has Him has fulfilled the law rightly. 

But it is an impossible thing,’ yes, completely against God, that one would want to do away with the law and abolish it, since it is in nature and naturally written in the hearts of all men and is innate in us. Although the natural law is somewhat obscure, and speaks only generally of works, Moses and the Holy Spirit expound it more clearly, and point out in particular by name the works that God wants us to do 


and to leave undone. Therefore Christ also says: "I c 


have not come to abolish the law", Matth. 5, 17. One should give a coat of gold to one, and hold him glorious in the world, who would bring it about that Moses would also be completely abolished by Christ. Oh, then we would see how it would be. Oh what a fine being it should become! But God be forewarned and protect us from such desolate error. He will not let us experience it. 

That | have spoken and written so harshly against the law with my teaching in the first is because the Christian church was completely overwhelmed and weighed down with all kinds of superstitions and aberrations. 


1) Cf. Cap. 52, § 6. 


and Christ was completely darkened and buried. | wanted to redeem and set free devout, God-fearing hearts from this kind of conscientiousness through the word of the Gospel. But | have never rejected the law. t would have been a louder caning and torture of ¢onsciences: in praying, there was only a babbling and ranting of many words; no prayer, but only a work of pbedience. For the pope commanded three kinds of prayer: The first, materialis, as when one only recites and speaks the words that one does not understand, as the nuns pray the Psalter. The other, formalis, when pne pays attention to the understanding of what they have in them. The third is affectualis, namely devotion and spiritual opinion, since it comes from the spirit. They paid little attention to this third, nor did they insist on it, but only that the words be told and spoken without understanding. 


56. how the law is fulfilled. (Cordatus No. 191.) By a gift (that is, the Holy Spirit) the Law began to be fulfilled in Christians, but by grace it is fulfilled, namely, forgiveness of sins. 


57. various nonsense. (Cordatus No. 1346.) The divine law is general, the natural is implanted all men, the civil is secular, the provincial municipalis] is land law; city law are some excerpts rom these all. But the papacy has no foundation. 


The preaching of the Law and the Gospel is necessary. (Contained in Cap. 37, § 50.) 


59 St. Augustine's Opinion on the Justification of the Law. (Cordatus No. 131.) 

Augustine's opinion is that the law, fulfilled by the owers of reason, does not justify, just as moral works 0 not justify the Gentiles. Even if the Holy Spirit had een added, works do not justify the Gentiles.

It is God's glory 


also a punishment of sin, which has fulfilled the law here. But the question here contrasted is not whether the law justifies, or the works of reason, or the so- called moral works. But the argument is whether the law, fulfilled by the Holy Spirit, justifies, and the answer is: No. For we say that the man who fulfills the whole law by the power of the Holy Spirit must nevertheless call upon the saving mercy of God, because he has not decided to be saved by the law, but by Christ, and works never make the mind of man calm and secure, nor the conscience happy and peaceful before God, which can be seen most of all in Christ, since he was afflicted, who truly could never have been afflicted if he had not been urged by the law, under which he placed himself for our sake, and [if he had not] entirely believed that God was angry with him and his enemy. How else could he have been grieved? 


To whom the law is given, and to whom the gospel is given. (Cordatus No. 1406.) 

The law does not suffer grace in its turn, nor does grace suffer the law. Thus the law is given to the hopeful, as the Zwickauer are, likewise to the hypocrites, who want and love many laws. But grace belongs to the wretched, the humble, the broken- hearted, such as Hausmann, Cordatus, Philip and myself. 


61) Whether to preach about God's grace and mercy alone. When one of the doctors asked Luther about this, 


to preach grace; though we make people more wicked and angry with it, God's word cannot be left out, but we also practice the ten commandments diligently, in its time and place. 


The gospel does not concern the wicked. 


(This § is spurious, just another redaction of Cap. 26, § 16, third para. Cordatus No. 815.) 


63. the office, use and fruit of the gospel and the law. 


The Gospel is like a fresh, gentle, cool breeze in the great heat of summer, that is, a comfort in the anguish of consciences, not in winter, when there is otherwise cold enough, that is, in the time of peace, when people are secure, and think to make themselves righteous and blessed before God by their works: but in the great heat of summer, that is, in those who rightly feel the terror and anguish of consciences, God's wrath widsr sin, and _ their weakness. 

But this heat is made by the sun: so shall the terror of the conscience be done and made perfect by the preaching of the law, that one may remember and consider that he hath transgressed the law of God, and not of man, and hath done contrary thereto.

good works, which God commanded and commanded in the ten commandments. But we are vexed and plagued by gnats, flies and vermin, that is, by the devil, the world and our own flesh, but we must tear through them and not let ourselves be deceived. 


436 Cap. 12: The Law and the Gospel. § 64-68. 437 


The gospel has delivered us from the Pabst's idolatry, 

superstition and countless abominations. 

How we have lived in such great darkness and superstition of human traditions and statutes, and how we have been entangled and entrapped with innumerable various ropes of conscience, is still witnessed by the papists' books and many living people. From all such abominations and snares we are redeemed and freed through Jesus Christ and his gospel, and called to true righteousness of faith, so that we may believe in God the Father with a good and calm conscience, trust in him, and boast that we certainly have forgiveness of sins, earned and acquired through Christ's suffering and death. 

Who can sufficiently praise and extol such a treasure of the conscience, which is now everywhere revealed, spread, offered, and given out of pure grace, that we are now victorious over sin, law, death, and the devil, and after that also freed and redeemed from all human statutes? And if we were to consider only the tyranny and caning of the confession of the ears, which is the least freedom, we could never thank the gospel enough for it. 

When the papacy was still in full bloom, every king would have gladly given 100,000 florins, a prince 100,000, a nobleman 100, a citizen and peasant 20 or 10 florins, that he might only be delivered from such tyranny and execution. But because such freedom is obtained in vain, by grace, you respect no one, nor do you thank God for it; but we all become worse than before. Thus the Gospel has brought freedom to both the Papists and the Waldensians, to the Hussites in Moravia (as they are called) today; but they abuse it shamefully, and are ungrateful, as we all are. 


This is the beginning of the new gospel. This is our Lord God's way and process in creation, to prescribe from weakness to power. First, he creates heaven and earth, that is, the raw matter, 


Then he gradually decorates them and completes them. From a kernel he produces a root and a tree. He creates the fruit in the womb and gradually brings it forth. He could well do one thing and say: Let there be a beautiful tree from the beginning; but he will not do it. It is the same with our gospel. First of all, it began weakly. Johann Huss, who was the kernel or seed, must die and be buried in the earth; then it grows with force. Our Lord God's thing is vain weakness. He reveals his gospel to the poor fishermen who do not know Hebrew, yes, who do not know anything at all, so that they can preach it; and yet this same supreme weakness is far stronger than all human strength; his nothingness is far more than all human multiplicity. And the more confessors of the gospel are put to death, the more come forth again daily. The devil cannot expel Christ, he must let him reign in the whole world. There are Christians in Constantinople and everywhere in Turkey. Also in Rome, where the Germans have their own temple, in which the Gospel is taught in German, although the Christians are not as strong and pure as elsewhere. 


66 On the Difference between the Law and the Gospel. 


(This § is thrown together from 6 sections: three from Luther's 1523 Preface on the Old Testament and three from his 1545 Preface on the New Testament. Walch, old edition, vol. XIV, Col. 3, § 4; Col. 99, § 2; Col. 2, s 2; Col. 3, § 4; Col. 102, R 10. 11. 12. 13.) 


67 Why no law was given to the believers. 


(This § is composed of Luther's Preface on the New Testament of 1545. Walch, old edition, vol. XIV, 103, K 14; K 15; anda passage from the great exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 2. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 137.) 


(68) To distinguish the gospel from the law, especially in

69. of the gospel art. 


Cassia is like cinnamon bark, has the power to cleanse and purify the eyes, and is good against viper and snake bites. It is an image of the Gospel, which drives away darkness and restores light, and is a common remedy to be used against all bites and stings of poisonous worms, that is, of the devil and his scales and servants. 


70. against the lawbreakers. (Lauterbach, Oct. 13 (XVII x. rrin.) 1538, p. 148.) 


On October 13, he preached at home on the Gospel of Luc. 14, since he did not know it in the church. On that day he was very surprised at the insolence of the antinomians, because they so rejected the necessary teaching of the law, since they did not see its effect. Therefore Augustine illustrated the power and the office of the law by a very beautiful simile, namely, that sins are revealed in us and wrath is increased, which, of course, is not the fault of the law, but of our nature, just as lime is still, but when water is poured over it, it becomes hot, not through the fault of the water, but through its nature; but when oil is poured on the lime, it remains still and does not become hot. This is a splendid similitude. 


For the sake of the law, St. Paul has much to do with the Jews. (Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 174.)

The Jews’ annoyance because of the law. 


The Jews were exceedingly vexed by this preaching, that the law was abolished and done away with, because Christ, the promised Messiah, had come; which went through the hearts of the Jews, who were zealous for the glory of God, like a shearing knife, and stung them hard and struck them on the head, Acts 7:54. 7, 54. For, truly, religion, worship, sacrifice, police, government and the temple were a fine and glorious treasure among the people. To reject this, no doubt, will have greatly angered and displeased many people. | truly believe that it penetrated the heart of dear Paul before his conversion, and hurt him very much, as Acts 9 says. 9, and after that to the people of Israel. We see from Romans 9 that even after conversion, St. Paul will still have had a great affliction from it. 


The law and the gospel should be diligently distinguished. 


(This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle, to the Galatians, Cap. 2. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 128 and § 152.) 


All laws are deadly apart from Christ. 


(This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 2. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 220.) 


The law, if kept equally, makes no one righteous before God. 


(This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, Cap. 2. walch, old edition, vol. VIII, § 160. cap. 3, § 532 and § 534.) 


The law puts all people under the curse who are outside the faith. (This § is found in the great interpretation of the Epistle to the 


Galatians, Cap. 3. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, §§ 209. 210.) 


The law, whether it is necessary for justification? 


When someone asked whether the law was also necessary for righteousness in the sight of God, D. M. Luther said, "The law is neither useful nor necessary for justification. M. Luther: The law is neither useful nor necessary for justification, much less for-

80. How to become wise before God. 


"The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord. 


78, a different, How the law is to be fulfilled. 


The law is necessary, but not for salvation, for no one can keep it; but the forgiveness of sins accomplishes and fulfills it: namely, if one believes in Christ crucified, he has done enough for the law with his obedience, suffering and death, and gives his payment to all those who recognize and confess their sins, and accept such gifts with faith. 


The law is not only not necessary for justification (that is, to become righteous before God through it), but it is completely useless, ineffective, even impossible. And when we speak of justification, w cannot speak enough against the law's inability and against the very poisonous and harmful reliance on th law. For the law is not given for the purpose of makin righteous or alive, or of helping righteousness, but onl for the purpose of denouncing sin and provoking wrath, that is, accusing and charging the conscience For as death was not put upon the human race that w might live by it, nor is sin inherent in us that we shoul be innocent and righteous by it; so also the law wa not given that we should thereby become righteous, pious, and blessed before God, since it can giv neither righteousness nor life. Summa, as high a heaven is from earth, so far shall the law be separate from justification. And in the business of justification ; nothing is to be taught, spoken, or thought of, excep UReaiSt eae ORLY the word of grace alone, evidenced in Christ.

Citizens are so godless that they would not even feed a pastor. If princes and lords do not do it, we are not to remain long. That is why Isaiah (49:23) said: "Kings will be their nurses", but peasants will not, as we unfortunately see in the experience of the ungrateful today. 


86. a whimsical story. 


In 1540 D. Martinus arranged a collation, to which he invited the most distinguished of the university: among them was also M. Eisleben, because of whom such a thing was begun. When they had eaten and everyone was happy, M. Luther had a glass handed to him, which was ripe; he brought it and drank it with wine to the guests. And when they had all said their piece, it came to M. Eisleben: D. Martin showed him the glass and said: "M. E., dear, | give you this glass with wine to the first rime, the ten commandments; to the second, faith; to the third, the Lord's Prayer; the Catechismum altogether. As he said this, he, M. Luther, drank the glass completely and had it filled again, and gave it to M. Eisleben. The latter, when he received the painted glass and began to drink, found it impossible that he could have drunk over the first rime, therefore put down the glass, and then had an abomination to look at it. Then M. Luther said: "| knew before that N. Eisleben would drink the ten commandments. Eisleben could drink the Ten Commandments, but he would leave the faith, Our Father, and the Catechismum alone. For he had also caused the antinomianism that the laws should be taken from the church to the town hall. 

Magister Johann Spangenberg, pastor of Nordhausen, was present when this happened in D. Luther's house. M. Luther's house, and also recorded such a story in his Bible.

because it is already created: therefore, a righteous man who is already righteous cannot be said to be still righteous, because he is already righteous. It does not rhyme, however, to say that, though we are initially justified by faith, after- 


448 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone justifies before God. § 1. 2. 


But at that time righteousness will be completed and replaced by works. 

This word also, that the righteous are called a new creature of God, and the firstfruits of his creature, stoppeth the mouths of all men. Therefore it follows that our works do nothing for righteousness: for our works or the works of the law do not make us a new creature of God; but as God alone began to make us new creatures by faith, so he also accomplishes it. "We are created in Christ JEsu unto good works," Eph. 2, 10. Therefore works do not create or make us, otherwise we would not be God's creatures; but, as they speak of it, creatures of our works. And even if our works do not make us their creatures (as they cannot), they still force God (according to their mind) to do so. 

As the beginning of the new creature is without the work of the law, so is also the middle and the end, otherwise the three, beginning, middle and end, would not be one creature, nor of one creator nor of one generation, but an ugly, monstrous creature, partly without work, partly for the sake of works. And God, who is not moved by any work to begin, would be moved by works to complete what he has begun. 

Now the faithful or righteous are born of God, John 1:13, but works do not give birth to anyone, but to God alone; therefore they do not make anyone righteous. 


2-11. disputation of Philipp Melanchthon with D. Martin Luther Anno 1536. 1)

It is evident that Augustine has expressed himself much more correctly when he is not in argument than when he is speaking in argument. For he

449 


If this is true, then we are not justified by faith alone, but by all gifts and virtues; this is certainly the opinion of Augustine. And from this came "the grace that makes pleasant" [[gratia gratum faciens] of the scholastics. But you, do you now hold that man is righteous by that regeneration, as Augustine, or rather by the righteousness which is imputed to us in vain, which is apart from us, and by faith, that is, the confidence which springs from the word? 


Answer by D. Martin Luther: 


This is my opinion, and of this | am most firmly convinced and certain that it is the true opinion of the Gospel and the Apostles, that we are righteous before God by imputation of righteousness alone, free of charge [imputatione gratuita].

Fol. 833.) - Melanchthon himself says in his edition, against Osiander, 1552, that he wrote down these propositions and presented them to Luther with the request that he would write down his answers to them in detail. This had happened sixteen years ago, that is, in 1536. - Christoph Pezel in his edition of Consilia Ph. Melanchthonis, Neustadii 

1600, reports that this disputation was recorded in the Acts of the Altenburg Colloquium and published against Osiander in 1552, sixteen years after it was written. Originally, however, it was written in the house of the pastor D. Bugenhagen, where Luther, Philippus, Jonas, Cruciger and others met to discuss it, because the arrival of envoys from England and France was expected. There, in the presence and before the eyes of all those present, the propositions of Philippus were drawn on paper, and Luther stated what his opinion was about them and wrote. 

Since this disputation is found in Stangwald only in Latin, but in all other editions no other than the inadequate Aurifaber'sche translation, we have seen ourselves compelled to venture the translation of the original. We have followed the text of the original of 1552 given by Férstemann, from which, by the way, the text given by Stangwald differs only in very slight variations.

451 





[3.] Pleas of Philip: 


Is man justified by this mercy alone? 

That he is not righteous by this mercy alone is evident from the fact that our righteousness is necessary, that is, a good conscience in works. 

Or will you not admit that it is said that man is justified chiefly by faith, and to some extent [minus principaliter] also by works, since faith signifies assurance, and in order that this assurance may remain certain, it must be understood that perfect fulfillment of the law [perfectio legis] is not required, but that faith substitutes for what is lacking in the fulfillment of the law? 

Ahr admits a twofold righteousness, namely that it is necessary before God, namely that of faith, and the other, namely that of a good conscience, in which faith replaces what is lacking in the fulfillment of the law. What is this but to say that man is not justified by faith alone? For surely you do not understand "being justified" in Augustine's way from the beginning of regeneration. 

Augustine does not think that man will be blessed for nothing, but that he will be blessed because of the virtues given to him. What is your opinion about this opinion of Augustine? 

Augustine's whole doctrine [ratio] of merit is different from yours, and he only cancels the merit of the ungodly. 


Dr. Luther's answer to all the preceding: 


My opinion is that man becomes, is and remains righteous, or a righteous person, simply through mercy alone. For this is a perfect righteousness, which is opposed to wrath, death, sin 2c., and it consumes everything and makes man simply holy and innocent, as if in truth he had no sin in himself, because the imputation of God, which is in vain, wills that there be no sin, as John says [1 John 3:9]: "He that is born of God doth not sin." For 


it disputes against each other, being born of God and being a sinner at the same time. According to this righteousness, man is righteous and is called righteous according to the work or fruits that God also demands and rewards. This is what | call an external righteousness and a righteousness of works, which cannot be holy in this flesh and in this life. Therefore, it does not take away death or sin, nor can it resist them, but only guards against future and greater sins. 


[4.] Words of Philip: 


l ask of Paul the born-again, why Paul, after he was born again, was already immediately righteous, that is, agreeable [acceptus]. 


Dr. Luther's reply: 


Of course, by nothing else but by the regeneration through faith alone, by which he was justified, he remains righteous and pleasant all the time. 


[5.] Philip's interjections: 


Is he then righteous only because of mercy? Or is he only righteous mainly because of mercy, and to some extent by his virtues or works? 


Dr. Luther's reply: 


No, but the virtues and works are just, because Paul is just, as a work pleases or displeases for the sake of the person, as is also said in Terence, because a good work, done by a wicked man, does not even please men. 


[6.] Words of Philip: 


It seems that [this] is not [done] for mercy alone, because you yourselves teach that the righteousness of works is necessary, and that before GOtte. And Paul, who believes and does, pleases [GOtte’; if he did not do, he would not please. Therefore our righteousness is at least a partial cause of our righteousness before God. 


452 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 6-11. 


Dr. Luther's reply: 


It is necessary, but not by a legal necessity, or by compulsion, but by such a necessity that it happens voluntarily, or that it follows from it, or that it is unchangeable. As the sun necessarily shines, since it is the sun, and yet it does not shine by compulsion of law, but by nature, or (that | say so) by an unchangeable will, because it is so created that it must shine: so the just man, as a new creature, does works by an unchangeable necessity, not by law or compulsion, for no law is given to the just [1 Tim. 1:9]. Then we are also (as Paul says [Eph. 2, 10.]) created for good works. By the way, when you say, "if he did not do, he would not please," this contains a contradiction [acceptus], because it is impossible to put a believer who does not do good. 


[7.] Philip: 

That is why Sadoletus says that we speak contradictory things, because we say: by faith alone, and yet we say that the righteousness of works is necessary. 


Luther: 


Certainly, because false brethren and hypocrites pretend to believe; therefore, works are required so that they may be put to shame in their hypocrisy. As Elijah demands works from the priests of Baal, where Baal was put to shame. For so also God necessarily does nothing but good, and yet without law 2c. 


[8.] Philip: 

When you say that we are justified by faith alone, do you understand this only from the beginning, namely from the forgiveness of sins? Or do you want the born-again Paul to please afterward, not because of his own obedience or virtues, at least in part, but only because of mercy? 


Luther: 


Yes, obedience pleases because Paul believes, otherwise his obedience would not be ge 


453 


And because the person is righteous, he is continually righteous and righteous by faith as long as faith remains. It is therefore a bad division to divide a person into beginning, middle and end. Therefore, works shine through the rays of faith and are pleasing for the sake of faith, not the other way around. Otherwise the works that follow would be more glorious than faith, in that they justify, because they justify longer (that is, in the middle and at the end of life), and so faith would justify only in the beginning, but afterward it would diminish or cease, leaving the works the glory, and so become void and transient. 


[9.] Philip: 

Paul is righteous, that is, accepted to eternal life, solely out of mercy. On the other hand, if the partial cause, namely obedience, were not added, he would not be saved, according to the words [1 Cor. 9:16], "Woe to me if | did not preach the gospel." 


Luther: 

No partial cause is added, because faith is always effective, or there is no faith. Therefore, whatever works are or are valid, they are and are valid through the glory and power of faith, which is inevitably the sun of these rays. 

[10.] Philip: 

In Augustine, the "by faith alone" excludes only the 

previous works. 


Luther: 


Whether this be so or not, the word of Augustine sufficiently shows that he is with us, when he says: "I may be affrighted, but | will not despair, because | will remember the wounds of God." For here he clearly states that faith is valid in the beginning, middle, and end, and continually, as David says [Ps. 130:4], "With thee is forgiveness," and [Ps. 143:2], "Go not into judgment with thy servant." 


[11.] Philip: Is this sentence true: The righteousness of works is necessary for salvation?

True saints are all church ministers, secular lords and authorities, parents, children, heads of households, household servants, and what is more, ordained and appointed by God, if they first hold and believe that Christ is their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and that after this each one does in his profession what God commands and ordains him, abstaining from the lusts and sins of the flesh. 

But the fact that they are not all equally strong, but that in some there are still many_ infirmities, weaknesses and aversions, does not harm their holiness; but so far as they do not sin out of evil intent, but out of weakness. For Christians feel the lusts of the flesh, but resist them, so that they do not carry| them out: and even if they fail, stumble and fall into

19. question. (Cordatus No. 1222-1225.) 


It is certain that reason, before faith and the knowledge of God, is darkness in divine things, but in the believer, through faith, it becomes a light and a very good instrument of godliness. For as in the ungodly everything they have by nature serves ungodliness, so in the godly it serves salvation. An eloquent tongue promotes faith, reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and made alive again. 

Just as our body will be resurrected glorified, so our reason according to faith is different from the one that was before. So it must be said of the memory, of the will, of the tongue-all are changed, as a red-hot iron is different from that which is not red-hot. And this is the rebirth through the Word, which, since the same members and person remain, yet makes the members and person different from what they were conceived and born from Adam. 

Reason, and all things which we have from the first birth sof Adam] are subject to vanity, are fool's work, but faith purifies the being from vanity. So even David separated natural use and his valor from his bow, swords, steeds 2c. [Ps. 44, 7.] Thus the godly say: Woman, children, gold do not help to heaven, and separate from every being [substantia] all vanity [vanitas]. For the essence of a harlot, for example, is not to be rejected, but her vanity, which Job well knew, saying [Job 2:10], "Thou speakest as foolish women speak"; he did not say, Thou speakest as women speak, which are wont to be foolish. He does not rebuke the sex, but the wickedness.

20. of the righteous faith Art. 


The righteous believers always think that they do not believe; therefore they struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle and strive without ceasing to maintain and increase the faith. Just as the good and skilful master craftsmen always see and notice that their work lacks something, even much, and is lacking; but the 


bunglers make themselves believe that they lack 


nothing, but that everything they make and do is quite perfect, just as the Jews think that they can well keep the Ten Commandments, since they do not learn them, nor do they respect them. 


(21) The Christian's only comfort is faith in Christ. (Here 7 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 37, § 133.) (Cordatus No. 1520.)

But as | once pondered on this day 3) (on which the monks had been assigned a special place) on these words [Hab. 2, 4.]: "The righteous lives by faith", and [Rom. 1, 17.]: "The righteousness that is valid before God" 2c., At the same time it came to my mind: If we have to live righteously by faith for the sake of righteousness, and this righteousness of God is for the salvation of every believer, then righteousness comes from faith and life from righteousness, and my conscience and spirit were raised, and | was made certain that it was the righteousness of God that made us righteous and blessed, and immediately these words became sweet and pleasant words to me.

24, triple justice. (Cordatus No. 1589.) 

The righteousness that must be diligently preached in the new churches is threefold: the educational consists in ceremonies; the civil, which the emperor has described much better than the pope. These two are necessary, but they do not justify. The righteousness before God, namely the theological one, is faith, and it justifies before God. Here belongs the forecourt for the outsiders, the temple and the holy of holies. 5) 


(25) By faith no man can teach rightly and purely, nor reprove and condemn the righteousness of works, except he be tried and drawn by the heel. (Cordatus No. 1219. 1220.) It is a great presumption if a man dares to say: |am

464 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 25-34. 


It is a great art to throw the trust in the works out of the heart and to consider their righteousness as dirt. It requires a practice, which Paul had in the most correct way, who speaks more contemptuously of the law than any of the sectarians about the sacrament of baptism or the Lord's Supper, since he calls it an office of death, of sin, of condemnation. Even Moses himself, if he lived today, could not bear these expressions of Paul with equanimity. 


(26) What faith is is understood only in temptations. (Cordatus No. 195.) 


The so-called justifying faith is formally the righteousness of a Christian, just as the whitewash gives shape to a wall, and heat makes the water boil. This faith is understood only in the cross, without the cross not at all. | am not referring to sins of the flesh, which also challenge the godly, but | call it a cross, which spiritual sins lay upon us, which those know who have experienced them. 


27. the Christians’ justice. (This § is contained in the previous §). 


28. faith does not respect repulsiveness. 


God despises and laughs at angry princes, as it says in the other Psalm. So also courageous preachers and Christians, who have faith, do not respect the world's anger and rage; for where there is faith, there must also be laughter. Although Satan also mocks and ridicules, when he said to Christ Matth. 4, 3: "If you are the Son of God, say that these stones become bread" 2c. And Matth. 27, 47: "He calls Eliam" 2c. But the Christian's laughter and mockery must go over the devil's laughter and mockery, and keep the defiance and the field. Therefore, just as the devil has sworn to kill us and wants to drag us down to hell and overthrow us, so we must climb over him into heaven and push him down into hell with our feet. 


465 


Faith is a great thing, whether it is weak or not. (Cordatus No. 375.) 

Faith is a very great thing in every way, which the Psalter amply indicates. | know that my faith stands like a fur on its sleeves. But it is faith and the church with me, in which all the devout pray for me and for all Christians. My likeness and my hands also pray for me. 


39. faith proven in the cross. 


The faith of the cross does it, for faith cannot be or exist without the cross. But when the water goes over the baskets, 1) he sees what faith is able to do and what it is. Not a speculation and a fictitious thought, but a certain confidence of the heart in God, which is righteous and the work of the Holy Spirit. 


31. strength of faith. (Contained in Cap. 7, Z100, last para.) 


What Joseph of Arimathea believed about Christ. (Cordatus No. 1385.) 

Joseph and the women at the tomb accepted Christ as a good friend and did not believe that he would rise from the dead. The apostles also had such faith. 


The righteous lives by his faith. (Cordatus No. 1388.) The devil cannot overthrow this reason: the righteous lives by faith. But blessed is he who believes. 


34) Abraham's faith. 2) (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1694.) Abraham will be held against us very sharply on the last day, because we have done a lot of things.

466 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 34. 35. 


have greater promises than he, and yet do not believe. Therefore, it is not surprising 1) that the Turk overtakes us. 

This example of Abraham far surpasses all understanding of human nature, that he overcame the fatherly love he bore for his only begotten son Isaac, in whom were the promises that his seed should be spread out like the stars in the sky and the sand on the sea. And yet, despite all this, he was more obedient to God and, against the law of nature, wanted to slaughter and sacrifice his son. How he would have felt at that time, for three days, and how his heart would have throbbed, what he would have had to endure, is not to be denied. 

The same is the example of Jacob, who lost his beloved son Joseph in his old days, because he did not know that he would perish and be eaten by wild animals. "I will now", he said Gen. 37, 35, "go down to my son into the pit in such suffering"; which probably indicates how great his heartache will have been. Thus, God has exercised them through their children's accident and misfortune. With which examples he comforted Doctor Benedictum Pauli, the honest man and jurist, since his son had fallen to his death in his absence from home. 


35. assurance of faith in the word through the Holy Spirit. (Cordatus No. 1213-1218.) 


Let us not divorce the Holy Spirit from faith, which is the very certainty in the Word, but not without the Word, but by the Word -comes it. 

All papists, Turks, sacramentarians have no certainty, and therefore also not the Holy Spirit, because they have what they claim in_ their unconditional righteousness, not in their words. They may do many good works, suffer many things, speak many very beautiful things, but they are and remain in doubt: "Who knows if it pleases God? 

A Christian is certain, neither wavering because of

of his holiness, nor does he ask the least about his unworthiness. He deals with "believing in Jesus Christ". And it is only the spirit [Cor. 12, 3] that can say that Jesus is the Lord; all others call him a curse. 

| believe that the Elector John had the Holy Spirit, for he did not want to deviate even a finger's breadth at Augsburg, and often said: "Tell my scholars to do what is right and not to look at me; and if he had not stood so firmly himself, many of our doctors would have fallen away. He held like a hero. He would not yield to the emperor, since he ordered him to desist from preaching, and since | admonished him to yield, because he was in a city of the same [emperor], he answered my letter 2): | do not know whether | am fooling or my scholars. For he was much more easily minded to move from Augsburg than to slacken his preaching there. 

It is the Holy Spirit alone who walks along in the certainty of faith in Christ without any doubt; the sectarians always speak some words from which one perceives that their heart is in doubt: | hope | am pious, | am righteous. But a Christian: | do what | can. What | do not do, Christ's suffering pays for me. |am blessed in Christ; no one shall take away my comfort. Jesus is my Savior, and there is nothing else by which our God and our conscience can be reassured.

36. difference of faith and hope. 

(The first 6 paragraphs of this § are omitted because contained in the Great Interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, cap. 5. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, §§ 63-67; U 69.70. 1)) 

Faith is the key to the holy Scriptures, and the right cabbala and interpretation, which one receives and learns from the other, as the prophets gave the teaching to their disciples, and one is always grounded on the other, as it were. Thus we teach and speak much differently of the faith and other articles of faith in the Scriptures than do foreigners; so that it may rightly be said that it is such a doctrine as one hands over and hands on to another, and always remains in one school. 

2) Faith is not a qualitas, as it is spoken of in school, but a gift of God for itself: and not only a knowledge and science, but also an assensus, an accident of the will, so that the heart certainly believes it to be so, as the Word instructs it, and says: Jesus Christ alone is the Savior of the world, for whose sake God is gracious to us and accepts us as His children and heirs out of pure grace and mercy, without any merit or worthiness on our part. Which the devils do not have, just as they do not believe all the articles of faith. 


37. what the reason of faith holds articles. (Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 173.) 


The articles of our faith are very foolish to reason and seem to be able to stand only by persuasion, as it were. Therefore, it is necessary to cling firmly to God's words. Three years ago there was a monk here with us, 


1) In this case, Stangwald, and after him Férstemann and the Erlangen edition, notes the origin: "from the great Commentaria D. M. L. on the Epistle to Galatians, as translated by Justus Mmius". Although almost all the many passages from the Epistle to the Galatians that are found in the Table Talks are taken from the translation of Menius, this does not apply here, where it is noted. 

2) This paragraph is another redaction of Cap. 13, § 60. 


3) D. i. Consent. 


a Moor, with whom we disputed through an interpreter, and through all our articles decided, he said: This is a good creda, i.e. faith. 


38. hope. (Lauterbach, April 8, 1538, p. 59.) 


Everything that happens in the whole world happens in hope. No farmer would sow a grain if he did not have the hope of the seed. No young man would marry if he did not have the hope of offspring. No merchant or day laborer would work if he did not expect profit and reward. 


39. weakness of faith. (Cordatus No. 824.) 


Since D. Jonas said that he could not believe this passage of Paul's [2 Tim. 4, 8.]: "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me," he answered that Paul did not believe it either, because it would be too high, and | also cannot believe as | preach, although everyone thinks that | firmly believe it. Nor would it be good for us all to do as God commands us, for he would lose his divinity; and the Lord's Prayer, the faith, and the articles of the forgiveness of sins would come to ruin; he would become a liar, and he alone would not be true, and all men would not be liars. And if someone says: If it turns out like this, God will have a small, little service on earth - he is well accustomed to that, he must and will be God of great mercy. 


40. of faith and its causes. 


The materia of faith is our will. The form is that one takes hold of the word of Christ, inspired by God. The final cause and fruit is that it purifies the heart, makes us children of God, and brings with it forgiveness of sin. And from these causes comes the definition of faith, namely: faith is a gift and present of God in our hearts, so that we may take hold of and grasp Christ, who for our sake is the Lord. 


470 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 40-46. 


471 





was born, died, rose again, and ascended into heaven, for whose sake we receive forgiveness of sins, eternal life, and salvation, by grace alone, without any merit or worthiness on our part. 

Since this righteous faith in Christ brings forgiveness of sins, it follows irrefutably that neither our works, nor caps and plates, nor devotion or vows make us blessed. When the Dialectica has thus done its work, and has briefly described faith, the Rhetorica comes to it, embellishes it and elaborates it with words, and indicates that faith brings with it forgiveness of sins, and makes children of God: but those who are children of God have the dear angels for friends and servants, and are lords of the devil, death and hell. 


Faith alone makes one righteous and blessed. (Contained in Cap. 13, § 66.) 


Faith must be everywhere, (Cordatus, No. 178 and No. 20.) 


Faith is necessary, not only to justify the wicked and to calm their hearts, but it is also true in all things what Paul says [Rom. 5:1]: "Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God." For if you, having a son, did not believe that he was your own legitimate son, you would feel constant struggle in your heart. 

| would not have believed that my first explanations of Galatians were so weak. They are no longer suitable for this time, they were only my first struggle against the trust in the works. 


43. how to become quite pious. 


Once we stop lying, deceiving, stealing, murdering, robbing, committing adultery, then we will become righteous, which is when we are buried in the ground with shovels. For Paul says, "He who has died is justified from sin," Rom. 6:7. 


44. How to be just before God. (Kummer, 2. Theil, p. 285. (Lauterbach p. 202.)) . 


"It is not up to someone's will or running", to this saying | answer: Paul (Rom. 9, 16.) does not at all disputirtt about the election [praedestinatio] in this place, but he speaks against the Jews and the righteousness of the law, and wants to say: You must despair and give God the glory, and say: | did not begin it. Thus, when | was a monk, | was a willing and a running man, but the longer | went on, the further | got away. But what | have, | have not by running, but from GOD. Thus Paul speaks in this passage all against presumption, that we may learn to say, Lord, it is thy grace which is in us. So he also uses the saying: "| will have mercy on whom | will have mercy. You will not do it without my forgiveness. In sum, all things are spoken against the trustworthy. To whom | give, he shall have it; you shall not take it from me with your holiness. What more shall he do? He will say: Ye shall have it, but ye seek it, and will have it with righteousness. | will not have it, but before | have it | will tear it all up and cut it off, priesthood, kingdom, even my law. But if ye have mercy upon me, ye shall have it. 

Here the doctor was asked by someone: "If someone had not come to this teaching, would he have been saved? | really don't know, he said, because | would have looked at baptism. It could have done so, 1) as | have seen many dying people who had Christ's cross held up to them. The man [Christ] has nevertheless been over the deathbed in the custom. 


Without faith, even God Himself is of no use. (Contained in Cap. 19, § 24, second half.) 


46 The article of righteousness, which is valid before God, preserves from all errors. (Enthaltm in Cap. 12, § 35, last paragraph.)

473 


If you see and respect Christians, you will soon extinguish all the merits of good works, for they can do nothing to earn you grace and salvation, or to save you from sins, death, the devil, and hell. 

The little children are saved by faith alone, without any good works, so faith alone makes them righteous. And if the power of God can do this in one, it can do it in all; for it is not the power of the child alone, but of faith: neither does his weakness or inability do it, for otherwise the same inability would be in itself a merit

5V. Faith, not good works, makes one righteous. 


Doct. Mart. Luther said in 1542 about tables that not good works but the grace of God merited eternal life and blessedness; this would be clear and obvious from the fact that they were not the spiritual birth, but only fruits of the same birth, for we would not become children of God, heirs of the kingdom of heaven, or righteous, holy and Christians through good works. But when we have been made, created and born children of God, then we first do good works; therefore, before our good works, we must have eternal life, God's grace and blessedness. For a tree does not become good from good fruit, but a good tree bears good fruit: the tree must first be good. Thus we are born, begotten and created righteous by the word 


done evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words." We should also remember that it says, "Forgive us our debts." | should say, | will not be pious before God's judgment, but gladly confess myself a sinner. What would be easier to say than that we say: 

man am a poor sinner, but you, God, alone are righteous? So it would be bad; 1) but we are our own executioners and cane-masters, tormenting and torturing ourselves with it. The spirit should say: | am pious and just; but the flesh must say: | am a sinner, you, God, are just; that you may be right in your words. 


51. we are more and more afraid of the devil, because we believe in Christ who comforts us; and of the difference of sins. 


One asked, "Why should we believe the devil who

from our spirit, and is the work and deed of our powers; therefore God has forbidden it by the highest penance and punishment. That we now believe more and before the punishment than the promise and reward is called reason or the spirit of man: Hoping and believing is different from thinking and speculating. Reason sees death before it; that it should not be frightened is impossible. Again, that God should give His Son and love us so much, we cannot be persuaded to say from the heart: Dear God, You did not let Your Son be crucified in vain. But this is beyond all human reason, that God is so merciful, not for the sake of my works, but for the sake of His dear Son. | do not want to enter into this. 

The article is lacking in all the red spirits, whether they say they believe or not. But | think they all have evil consciences, which | prove with this: For when the fall and the misfortune come under their eyes, that they come into redness and danger, they despair, as Arius, Muenzer 2c. Therefore | think they know that they do wrong. Thus the bishop of Minin and Duke George make a joke out of God's word; as Adam did in paradise, and human nature is always in the habit of doing: when it sins, it thinks it has no need. Thus God causes them to fall from sin into sin against the Holy Spirit, so that they sin knowingly and willfully. George fell into sin, because he saw that he was doing wrong, and yet he did not cease and desist, and not only persisted in such sin, but also did not ask for forgiveness. This is a sin against the Holy Spirit; so one comes out of the other table into the first. But if you feel it is wrong and have an evil conscience, this is not a sin against the Holy Spirit. But if you sin and make a good conscience out of it, that is a sin against the Holy Spirit. Of this kind are Duke G[eorg], H[ein] Mordbrenner's Carlstadt, MUnzer, where one knowingly punishes our Lord God with lies. 

Oh dear Lord God! It is enough, yes, all too much, that one sins and does wrong: it is 


It is enough that one has sin, but one still wants to be right. No householder suffers such people in his house: anger burns in the heart and becomes more intense when the one who has done wrong still wants to be right. But if you confess the sin, and yet do not refrain from it, it is a great sin, and is called despising God; but it is not a sin against the Holy Spirit: but if you know that you do wrong, and still defend it, that is too much. 

Our Lord God can suffer that no sin can be so great, if you fall down before Christ and ask for forgiveness, it is forgiven. But Duke Georg] relies on the fact that the Christian church will forgive him, and so he continues. But he will find out differently. 

(The following paragraph at Cordatus No. 33.) 

My opinion is that many kings of Israel, who ruled very badly, became blessed, because in death they called on the name of God Israel, and their sins were easily forgiven. But this seems to be certain of those about whom it is written, "And he slept with his fathers,” that is, in the same faith in which his fathers died. Of the godless Ahab one reads a great testimony that he became blessed, since God says to the prophet: "Did you not see how Ahab bowed down before me?" Solomon has sufficient testimonies in the Scriptures that he has become blessed. (This he answered me because | claimed that Solomon was damned). 


The most noble article of Christian doctrine is that of the blessedness of souls. 


This is the most noble article of the whole Christian doctrine, namely, how we shall be saved. All theological disputations should be directed to this article, which all the prophets have most often dealt with and blued themselves with. For if this article of our salvation is grasped and retained with certain and firm faith, then the other articles will come and follow smoothly after it, as of the Trinity. Nor has God declared to us any article so publicly and clearly as this, namely, that 


476 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 52-56. 


471 





we are saved through Christ alone. Although he also said much about the Trinity, he always rested on this article of the salvation of the soul. There is much in the others, but this is the most important; for all the works of the papists are instituted and performed for their sake, so that they may attain eternal blessedness. But they are deceived, for apart from Christ there is no blessedness, which can only be grasped in the Word through faith. Since this article remains pure, the church also remains pure; but if it is adulterated or falls away, then the church has become a whore and is gone, as we have seen and experienced in the papacy. 


How to become pious before God. 


How one should become pious, that is what one asks. A barefoot monk says: Put on a gray cap, wear a rope and a plate. A preacher monk says: Put ona black robe. A papist: Do this or that work, listen to mass, pray, fast, give alms 2c., and each one what he thinks will make him blessed. But a Christian saith, By faith alone in Christ thou shalt be saved, justified, and blessed, by grace alone, without any works of thine own, and without any merit of thine own. Now consider one another, which is the true righteousness. 


54. presumption of faith. 


St. Paul, 1 Corinthians 13, speaking of love and praising it highly, punishes the false and mouthed Christians, who had well begun and boasted of faith, when none was left but had perished, out of sheer presumption. As also Matthai 7, 22. the hypocrites will say in that day: Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? 2c. So Balaam blessed and confessed God in Israel with right faith and spirit, and from without with work and deed; but he fell away again and was presumptuous. Like Thomas Muenzer, when he had once rejected faith, he became presumptuous and foolish. So do all presumptuous men, and let them dream, 


They may do what they want and desire under the appearance and name of faith, like Ananias and Sapphira in the stories of the apostles in chapter 5. And Saul was a miracle man in the first place, after which he was presumptuous, thinking that everything he did and did was right and good, and that God would have to let him do it. As also Apost. 15, 5. st. happened, when a concilium was held, whether the law of Moses should be imposed on the Christians, or whether good works were also necessary for salvation. 

Therefore St. Paul says 1 Cor. 13, 7: "Love believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things," even though it sometimes overcomes the wickedness of men and makes them weak. Therefore he says Cap. 10, 12: "He who stands there, let him see that he does not fall"; demands a faith that is not made up and false, thereby indicating and giving to understand that a true faith tends to become a made-up faith if one does not live, watch and pray in the fear of God. 


55. weakness of faith. (Cordatus No. 1369.) 


The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak [Matth. 26, 41], this is what Christ says about himself; Paul says the same in Rom. 7, the spirit would like to believe, but it is hindered by prudent reason. Our Lord God must have patience and not extinguish the smoldering wick [Isa. 42, 3; Matth. 12, 20] and be satisfied with the firstfruits of the spirit that we have. sTogether] with the pope, the lawyers have deceived us. 1) 


56. weakness of faith in paulo. (Cordatus No. 1392.) 


That Paul was also weak in faith, we can see from the fact that he was often comforted by the brethren, and in temptation the intercourse with godly people is of great benefit. 


1) In the original: Ouni ?Lpa oepit “urista. This seems to give us the above sense, since the jurists dealt with nothing but the Pope's canons and decrees. 


478 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 57-60. 


An example of faith in theurization. 


On the 13th of the fallow month of Anno 39, D. Martino was told what had happened not far from the custom 1) in times of theurungs: namely, how a pious God-fearing matron with two children suffered great hardship. Since she had nothing more to live on, she adorned herself with her little children and wanted to go to a well, praying that God would sustain and refresh her in such a difficult time. On the way, a man met her, asked her, and argued with her: "Would she also like to eat from the water of the well? But she said, "Yes, why not, for all things are possible and easy for God: He who fed the great people of Israel forty years in the wilderness with manna can also sustain me with drinking water. And when she so steadfastly affirmed it, and persevered, the man (perhaps an angel) said, Behold, because thou hast so steadfastly believed, go home, and thou shalt find three bushels of flour 2c., and she shall have found it so according to his words 2c. 

Then said D. Martin Luther said: "If it is true, itis a great miracle and example of faith; but if it is invented, it is a Christian and artificial poem to provoke people to faith. 


58. be sure of the faith. 


He who is not sure of his faith cannot stand: but the foundation of faith, on which he builds, is God's Word, rightly understood. Whoever has this pure and unadulterated can stand and win in the battle against all the gates of hell; but whoever is not sure of his doctrine and faith, and still wants to dispute about it, is lost. 

But D. Mart. Luther said: "A Christian must be certain of his faith, or strive to become certain of it, and then, when the time and the matter demand it, confess it freely and constantly. An uncertain heart should not be sworn to God's Word and Sacraments. 


1) Stangwald: Sittau. 


479 


(Here 12 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 1, § 31.) 


Item: Every Christian should be equipped in such a way that he is certain of his faith and doctrine, and so establishes himself with sayings from God's Word that he can stand against the devil and also defend himself if he is led astray, and thus help to maintain and defend the doctrine. 


Never again will there be unity in the church, in the doctrine. 


There will never be a concilium, said D. Martin Luther, because the people should agree together out of the Holy Spirit. God allows this to happen for the very reason that He Himself wants to be the judge and not suffer men to judge. That is why he commands everyone to know what he believes. It will not help that you say you have heard and heard it preached; the devil will not inquire. But if you have God's word, you can say, "Here | have the word; what else may | ask, what the concilia say? then he must return. 

Because God wills, as we see, that His word shall suffer no judge but Him: so let no man depart here, neither can there be any rest. And since God is before us, if there were silence and rest, the gospel would be over: it must rumble wherever it goes; if it does not, it is not right. Therefore Christ says Luc. 12:49, 51: "I am come to kindle a fire upon the earth: what would | rather that it were kindled? Do you think that | have come to give peace? | say, no, but discord." If this is to work, Ishmael must move his hand, and that one again. Then let the Holy Spirit separate us; when men want to separate, it only becomes worse. 


60. what faith is. (Cordatus No. 1807.) 


Faith is not a constitution in the spirit, that is, a thought; for however great this may be, it is not valid in itself, but this is the faith that 


480 Cap. 13. That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 60-66. 


Christ in himself and grasps Christ. Apart from Paul, this theology is not there. (This incompetent people do not believe.) 


61. to lament weakness of faith cheaply. (Contained in Cap. 26, B 28.) 


62. Luther's complaint about his weak faith. 


When the text from the prophet Hosea (Cap. 13.) was sung over the table of D. M. L.: "This is what the Lord says" (Josquinus 2), he said to D. Jona: "As little as you believe that this song is good, so little do | believe that theologia is true. Jonah: "As little as you believe that this song is good, so little do | believe that theologia is true. | love my daughter, yes, | love her better than myself (this is certainly true), that is, | would rather die than that she and the little children should die. | love Christ, who redeemed me with his blood from the devil's power and tyranny, but my faith should be much greater and more fervent. Oh my Lord, "do not enter into judgment with your servant" 2c. 


63. the Christians’ greatest art. 


D. Luther said: "If anyone asks, 'What can Christians do and teach?' then one should answer nothing else, except that one knows Christ and believes in him, and knows that he was sent by the Father, John 17. Anyone who cannot do this, nor teach or practice it, cannot boast of being a Christian, even if someone else knows everything that happens under heaven, and how God created heaven and earth, with the sea and all that is in it, and even that he knows the Ten Commandments and keeps them. In sum, even if he knows and is able to do as much as the angels, none of this makes a Christian; therefore God says Jer. 9:23, 24: "Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom, nor the mighty man of his strength. But if any man will boast. 


1) The last sentence is an addition of Cordatus, with which he aims at Melanchthon, Cruciger and Jonas, with whom Cordatus was in a fierce dispute in 1536 and 1537 because of synergistic statements. Cf. Cordatus No. 174. 221.

64. faith the most pleasing service. (Contained in Cap. 38, § 2.) 


65. believe the some rule in theologia. 


There is only one article and rule in Theologia: whoever does not know and have it well is not a theologian, namely, right faith or trust in Christ. The others all flow into and out of the article, and without it the others are nothing. The devil has contested this article from the beginning of the world, would have liked to destroy it and in its place impose his wisdom on the afflicted, miserable, afflicted and contested hearts: they like this article, and it is they who understand the article. 


Faith alone makes one righteous before God. 


Adam received the promise of the given seed before works and sacrifices, before he did good and sacrificed; so that the truth may stand, that faith without works obtains righteousness and forgiveness of sins before God, by pure grace. Therefore, the Epistle to the Ebrians, Cap. 11, 4, rightly praises the faith of Abel in his sacrifice, yes, he also praises faith in all the works and deeds of the saints, that God considered him before works, yes, through faith and from faith all works followed. 

Therefore, the separation of the righteousness of faith and works is not to be allowed or permitted, as if they were two distinct righteousnesses, as the sophists teach, otherwise they will be truly and rightly separated and set apart; but it is One righteousness of faith and works in righteous Christians, just as God and man are One Person, body and soul are One Man. For as soon as they are separated and set apart, faith is gone, and works remain, which is double hypocrisy.

74) Causes of faith. 1) 


Christians are righteous and holy by faith. The real cause of faith, which works and creates it, (Contained in Cap. 38, § 3.) is the Holy Spirit, and is a gift of God alone: the formalis and materialis is that he takes hold of and

Word; finalis, the final cause, is first of all our righteousness, so that we are counted righteous before God, and then God's glory, so that God is honored, praised and glorified: after that follow the fruits. 


Our faith is very weak, and yet it is a rock, for it is al cornerstone in the heart: that is, an inexpressible ‘groaning, and the Holy Spirit to it, who holds fast what God has promised; who does it. 

Then someone asked: Why does God not give us perfect knowledge? Luther answered: "If anyone (Here 2 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 16, § 4.) could believe it, he could neither eat nor drink with joy, nor do anything else: God wants to preserve the) What man's reason and other powers and members do for faith. church until the last day, so that it will not perish.

and Justitia, righteousness. Then | rhymed the abstract and the concrete, righteousness and being righteous, together, and became certain of my cause, learning to distinguish the righteousness of the Law from the righteousness of the Gospel. Before, | lacked nothing, for | made no distinction between the Law and the Gospel, taking them all for one, and saying that there was no difference between Christ and Moses, except for time and perfection. But when | found the right difference, that one thing was the law, another the gospel, | tore through it. 

Then said D. Pommer: | also began to be of a different mind, when | read of the love of God, what it means passively, namely, that it is called such a love, so that we are loved by God; before | understood the love active, so that we loved God, M. Luther said: "It is clear of love, that it is often called in Scripture such a love, so that God loves us; but in the Ebrew language the oonitivi of love are difficult. Pommer said: but nevertheless they explain other sayings after it. 


Rebirth alone makes God's children, not works. 


In 1542, Martin Luther said of the article of our justification before God that it is like that of a son: he is born an heir to all his father's goods, and does not become so by merit: he succeeds to his father's goods without any work or merit. But the father admonishes him to do and accomplish this or that diligently, and also promises him a gift or present, so that he may be the more willing to do it, and the more willing, easy, and pleasurable to accomplish it. As when he says to his son, "If you will be pious, follow me and be obedient and study diligently, | will buy you a beautiful tunic. 2c. Item: Come here to me, and | will give you a beautiful apple. Thus he teaches the son to walk by the benches: since the inheritance is otherwise and without that naturally due and due to him; but the father wants to make the child happy by the promise to do what the father has promised. 





485 


wants to have. The child is to be preserved in pedagogy. God also deals with us in this way, is kind to us with sweet, sweet words, promises us spiritual, eternal, physical and temporal goods; since eternal life is given to those who believe in Christ out of pure grace and mercy, free of charge, without all our merit, good works and worthiness, as cure children, or filiis adoptionis, who come to it through water and the Holy Spirit. 

And so one should also teach in the church and congregation of God that God wants righteous good works, which he has commanded and commanded, not which we do and do ourselves out of our own choice and devotion or good opinion; as the monks and priests have taught in the papacy: for these do not please God, as Christ says Matth. 15, 9: "In vain do they serve me, because they teach nothing but the commandment of men" 2c. Thus one should teach about good works, but always so that the article of justification, namely, that only faith in Christ makes us righteous and saved, remains pure and unadulterated, as it is the main part, cause and source of all other promises: where this remains pure and endures, the church also remains pure. For Christ can no longer suffer anyone else besides Himself; He wants to have the bride alone, according to the saying: Mine alone, or let it be. He is a zealot. 

Should one then also teach and say: If you believe, you will be saved; if you do what you want, it is no good at all. For faith is either false and fabricated, or, if it is righteous, it is extinguished when one knowingly and wantonly goes against God's commandments: and the Holy Spirit, which is given to the faithful, is lost through evil works done against the conscience, as David's example sufficiently testifies, 1 Kings 12, Psalm 51. Therefore we should know that such promises and rewards are only a pedagogy or child training, so that God stimulates and entices us, makes us happy and willing, like a pious, kind father, to do good and to serve our neighbor, not to earn eternal life with it, because he gives and bestows the same only out of pure grace.

78. objection that faith makes you righteous. (Contained in Cap. 12, § 84.) 


79. from where one becomes fair initially. (Cordatus No. 1146.) 

The beginning of justification is the grace and the promise. So justification happened to Abraham while he was still an idolater, to Moses as a murderer, and unexpectedly, 1) they did not think of it. 


The most distinguished main article of Christian doctrine. 


The article of justification and forgiveness of sins is the noblest and most distinguished, very comforting, and to which Satan is exceedingly hostile. That is why St. Paul has been so assiduous in his efforts, always showing grace upon grace in defiance of the devil; for the devil does not want to let Christ reign, whom he must nevertheless let remain and reign. As St. John says in his | Epistle, Cap. 4, 4, says: "He that is in you is greater than he that is in the world." 


(81) Faith alone makes one righteous. 


D. Martinus spoke much in 1541 about the majesty and glory of the article of justification, which is quite unknown to human wisdom, because we are by nature so minded that we are more concerned about the righteousness of works than about the mere mercy of God, which is offered and given to us free of charge, by grace, for the sake of Christ. Therefore, the parable of Matth. 20, 1. ff. about the laborers whom the householder hired into his vineyard is a mighty thunderclap against this carnal delusion of human reason. 

He then told a story from the life of the old fathers about a hermit who had led a very strict life and was considered a living saint. When an old father came to him with a young brother to visit him in his cell, a murderer met him and went with them to the sick man, 


1) The reading illsporgto needs no change. The word is to be understood as an adverb, not as an ablative. 


stopped outside the door, heard and saw the old patient's holiness, that he had led such a strict life, wondered about it, sighed and said: "Oh, | should have lived like that. The sick man said, "Yes, you should have done as | did when you wanted to be saved in another way. And when he had said this, he died. But the young brother saw that his soul was led away by the devil in the air, and he wept bitterly. The murderer followed them, had remorse and sorrow, wanted to confess and receive absolution and forgiveness of his sins through faith in Christ, hurried and ran so much that he fell down his neck and died. Then the angels took his soul. The young brother saw this and laughed and was happy about it. The old father, when he saw that the young brother was acting so strangely, for now he was weeping over the death of the holy man; soon he was laughing at the accident of the murderer, so he asked him why he was acting like that. But he said that he had done right and Christianly: for when he saw that the trustworthy saint was damned, he would have meant it; but when he saw that this poor sinner had been converted and had become blessed, he would have laughed justly. And said D. Luther said: "Thus it is in the kingdom of Christ that the last become first, and the first last; for God cannot tolerate any sin less than the apparent hope and presumption of one's own righteousness. 


Believing in God is not everyone's cup of tea. 

Trusting God, believing in Him, and doing Him justice in all His words and works is a great art, which even God-fearing and well-practiced Christians often lack: we have had to learn this art long enough throughout our lives. But that the faithful God may awaken, kindle and strengthen faith in us, He entices us most kindly through Christ (in whom all the promises of God are Yes and Amen, 2 Cor. 1, 20, and all the treasures of wisdom lie, Col. 2, 3), since He says Luc. 12, 32: "Fear not, little host, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom," 2c.: nor are we afraid of Him. Is it not the devil? 


488 Cap. 13 - That faith in Christ alone makes one righteous before God. § 83-85. 


The Christians’ religion and faith. 


There is no religion and faith more foolish under the sun than that of the Christians: for what reason and wisdom can persuade a man that there is a God? If human reason falls into it, and Erasmi head and mind, he ridicules and mocks it. Therefore, the religion of our Christian faith can never be taught enough in the world, so terrible and horrible is the fall of man. Remembering the sin committed and forgiveness is the nourishment of faith, from which it increases and grows. 


84 The consequence of faith. 


If you believe, you speak. If you speak, you will suffer. If you suffer, you will be comforted. For faith, confession and the cross belong together, and are the duty of a true Christian. 


That the enemies of the gospel must bear witness to the doctrine of the righteousness of faith, that by it alone one is justified before God. 


Duke Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, has himself told me, Doct. Martin Luthern himself said that when Duke Hans of Saxony, Duke Georgen of Saxony's eldest son, wanted to die, he desired in his last moments the Lord's Supper of Christ in both forms. Then the father, Duke George, had an Augustinian monk from Old Dresden demanded for his son, and informed the same monk that he should give his son good words, and persuade him to receive the Lord's Supper in the same form, and should preach to the son as if he, the monk, were well acquainted with Doct. Luthern and had dealt with him a great deal. 


489 


and that he, Luther himself, had advised some that they should receive the Lord's Supper in the same form. Thus the pious prince was persuaded to receive the Lord's Supper from the monk in the same form. 

When Duke George saw that his son was in his last days and was dying, he comforted his son with the article about the righteousness of faith in Christ and reminded him that he alone should look to Christ, the Savior of the world, and forget all his works and merits, including the invocation of the saints. When Duke Hansen's wife, Landgrave Philip's sister in Hesse (later called the Duchess of Rochlitz) heard this, she said: "Dear Father, why is this not preached publicly in the country? Duke George answered: "Dear daughter, it should only be said to the dying and not to the healthy. 

This Duke Johann died Anno 1537 on the Tuesday after Epiphania on 13. Januarii dora 8. in the evening. He was to inherit Duke Georgen and be regent in Meissen, and had to swear an oath to his father that he would remain an eternal enemy of the Lutheran doctrine after his death. Therefore, he also had the old Lucas Cranach, painter, Doctori Martins Luthern, offer that he wanted to be his worse enemy than his father would have been. But then God came with his righteous judgment and brought him down. 

Doctor Johann Eccius does the same, said D. Luther. Luther: he confesses that my doctrine is the truth, and serves to comfort, strengthen, and straighten consciences: but such doctrine makes wild, desolate people, so that there is no discipline in the world.

In ceremonies and statutes, the realm of love should prevail and rule, not tyranny. Item, will experience of the love, not a rope. They shall all be done, judged and interpreted for the benefit of the neighbor. The greater he is who rules; the more he shall serve according to love. 


4. good works of Christians. 


The good works of holy and righteous devout Christians are unclean and defiled when they are seen in themselves alone, separated from faith, as 


But because faith is and must be by nature and kind before works, we rightly say that we are justified by faith alone. For it is not by works that we believe, since they are not yet present or done, but by the Word, which promises grace, and clearly says that believers are pleasing to God and blessed, and that sins are forgiven. After this, one does good works by faith. Thus, faith is magnified and made known, indeed, made almost tangible, through works. Just as the Godhead alone, and Christ the Lord also, cannot be seen nor understood; but after he has become man, he becomes visible and tangible, as John says, 1 Epist. 1, 1:"The word that our hands have touched," and Joh. 1, 14, "that was used among us," 2c. For as soon as itis separated and set apart, there is no other God anywhere, and the flesh becomes harmful twice over. 

For if we are justified by works which follow faith, we are not justified by faith, nor for Christ's sake, but by ourselves, as doing works after faith. But this is to deny Christ; for Christ is not apprehended and grasped by works, but by faith of the heart. Therefore it is necessary that we be justified by faith alone,

they be trusted in, it is profitable that they should be condemned, and made sinful; as it ought and must be, when they are set apart, as a way to righteousness, separated and set apart from faith. 


>492 Cap. 14. of good works. §4-7. 493 


Works, however, are praised for the sake of faith, are considered good, and please God. Therefore, the righteousness of the works is also of the faith from which they flow and origin, not of the works. 

Now as it is false and unjust for them to say that the righteous are provided for salvation by the works that are to come, so it is also false for them to pretend that one is justified and saved by the works of faith that were done before. But as the grace of salvation bringeth good works afterward, which alone, without any works, calleth and calleth him that shall be justified, and doeth good works: so also faith bringeth good works, which justifieth and blotteth out sin before all works. For faith is not accepted because of works, but works are done because of faith; neither does faith wait for works to make it righteous by them, but works wait for faith to make them righteous and good by it. So that faith is passiva justitia fidei, that is, faith, as the working righteousness, works and brings about good works, but works are the suffering righteousness, effect, and fruits of faith. Otherwise, and without this, works would be the real cause of righteousness, as without which the effect and fruits of righteousness would not exist nor could be; even if faith were there as a cause, yet without the effect and consequence of righteousness it would be utterly void, fictitious, or lost. 


5. to do a good work. 


Many are not worthy to do one good work; and truly it is a great thing that a man should be worthy to do a good work. 


6. whose good works please God. 


Good works are pleasing to God, even to those who have forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ; they also have their reward. But if the heart relies on them and trusts in them, thinking that it will have a gracious God through them, they are useless. 


and cannot please God, for trust is not due to our works or the works of others, but only to God's mercy in Christ. Our works are not to be set against grace. Oh no; but they should be done as obedience, which we owe to God, a kind, gracious and merciful Father, confessing that even if we do everything we can and owe, we are still useless servants, Luc. 17, 10. 


Give, and it shall be given to you again. 


This is a certain saying (Luc. 6, 38.) that makes people rich and poor. It sustains my house. | should not boast; but | know what | give a year. And turned to D. Gregorius Brick, and said: If my gracious lord would give a thousand florins to a nobleman, he would not receive my house with it, and have only three hundred florins; but God gives enough, he blesses it. 

There was a monastery which, because it gave gladly, became rich; but when it gave no more, it became poor. One day a beggar came to the monastery and asked for alms, but was refused them. The beggar asked why they would not give him anything for God's sake. Then the porter said: We are poor. Then the beggar said, "The reason for our poverty is that you had two brothers in the monastery, one of whom you expelled, and the other of whom also turned away secretly and left. For, after brother Oats, prayed, was cast out and rejected, so the other brother, Dabitur, to whom is given, has also lost himself. 

And that is also true, said D. M. Luther, the world is obliged to help its neighbor in three ways: by giving, lending and selling. But now no one gives, everyone robs, scratches, and pulls for themselves; they take well and steal gladly, but give nothing: so no one lends, but only usurps, scrounges, and scrapes: no one sells any more, but he sells and deceives everyone. That is why there is no more vadttur, our Lord God does not want to bless so abundantly anymore. Rather, whoever wants something must also give. Never run to a gentle hand. 


494 Cap. 14: Of good works. §8-14. 495 


8. pious hearts anxiety. 


It is difficult for a pious man to get out of the works and to be right in them, for he knows that God wants them, and he gives earnestly to do them. But if he makes this distinction, that she will have God, and one should do it, but not rely on it, nor build on it, (which is very difficult and humanly impossible because of original sin, where the Holy Spirit does not stir the heart, teaches, guides and governs by God's word), but God will reward her here on earth with peace, rest and other gifts and pay well; then | should not worry about it, but believe him, because he will have it so. 


9, merit. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 152.) 


10. from the saying: whoever has two re. (Contained in Cap. 4, Z124, the last two paragraphs.) 


11. never do the highest penance. (Cordatus No. 1742.) 


Since Christ says [Joh. 8, 11.]: "Sin no more", he demands first of all faith, secondly also the improvement of life. He who does not promise this cannot be absolved. 


12. 'The works of the profession shall be greatly respected. (Lauterbach, Aug. 22, 1538, p. 117.) 


He marveled at Wicel's bitterness and envy, who sought to write much against the Lutherans without having anything, but seize every opportunity where he can; how he picks on the saying, since we have taught that the works of a publican are far better than all the works of the hermits. There the wretched man argues against us. He does not take into account the works of profession, but only those of superstition. Paul has written in his letters more abundantly and appropriately of virtues and good works than all the philosophers; he also exalts the worldly works in the godly. Should not David's war and battle have been better than the very best, most pious monks' fasting, praying, 


let alone superstitious monks, among whom was the one who wanted to conquer his evil lust by breaking his beloved cooking pot? truly a great killing of the flesh! 


13) Give freely and simply, without any pleasure. (Lauterbach, Nov. 15, 1538, p. 167.) 


Since they came to the small town of Jessen, he gave alms to the poor. Also D. Jonas gave with these words: Who knows where God will give it to me again. Luther laughed and said: "As if God had not given it to you before 1). One must give freely out of pure love. 


14. reward of good works. 


In 39, January 21, an Englishman, D. Antonius Barns, asked M. Luther: "Whether the Christians and the godly, who are now righteous through faith in Christ, deserve anything for the sake of the following works? because such a question would be very mean in England. Answered D. M. Luther: First, let it be known that we are still sinners, now that we are already righteous, as we believe and pray for forgiveness of sin in this life: "Forgive us our trespasses", and Psalm 32:6: "For this all the saints will ask you" 2c. This opinion and sentiment is certain that we are all sinners, and live under the grace and forgiveness of sins. 

On the other hand, God promises retribution and reward to those who do good, so we deserve something, one might say. Well, let it be equal, God repays and rewards persons for good works, but differently; just as one star is distinguished from another. And these things all happen and are under the forgiveness of sins; for since heaven, thatis, since justification is under grace, how much more are the stars under grace? For just as the stars do not make or decorate heaven, but only adorn and decorate it: so works do not make heaven, but adorn the faith that makes righteous. 


1) formerly - before. 


496 Cap. 14: Of good works. § 14-17. 497 


We are to believe the word badly and simple- mindedly, and because we have now been justified, do good works which God has commanded, then we are stars. 

This single argument solves and _ resolves everything: | believe in Jesus Christ, who suffered under Pontius Pilate 2c. for us: He alone is everything, our work is nothing; he alone does everything, we not, as far as salvation is concerned. But after that, if by grace we have become children of God, we are also differentiated in gifts, one having this gift, the other another gift; so there is a difference among Christians because of gifts, as the heaven has various different stars. Summa, the article of justification by Christ solves it all. For if Christ deserved it by his suffering and death, we do not deserve it: in Christ there are gifts, not merit. Since the principal and self-existent righteousness is nothing, the accidental righteousness, accidentalis Justitia, is also nothing. The substantialis justitia, principal righteousness, is the righteousness of faith: the accidentalis, accidental righteousness, are the gifts; but God crowns nothing, but only his gifts. 


15. the word reward and merit. 


The word reward is very well interpreted and 

explained by St. Augustine, against the fallacies and deceitfulness of the sophists and the school bully, since ‘they say that the Virgin Mary, with her virginity, deserved to become the mother of Christ, the Son of God, that is, she was sent with her virgin body to give birth. Truly, this is a beautiful merit, a fine merit, as if | said, "The tree deserves to bear fruit, for God has ordained and created it for this purpose, so that it may stand on God's gifts, not on our works. So Augustine looked diligently at the word merit, and concludes from the words of Mary, the virgin: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord. He has considered the lowliness of His handmaid"; that it is on God's grace, not on our merit. For the merit of our works is nothing with God, but the merit of our righteousness. 


The only way we can be justified before God is by grace, or Christ must have died in vain. Apart from this, we are all non facientes, sed patientes, who only suffer, not work; for there must be a difference of gifts. This error comes from the confusion and mixture of the law and the gospel, which are mixed and brewed together: if each doctrine does not remain in its circle, as God has ordered it, then we make hell out of heaven, and again, a heaven out of hell. 


16. alms of D. Martin Luther in the Theurung. 


I, said D. Martinus Luther, tried it, and stopped at the Schésser, he wanted to lend me several bushels of grain for poor people, just at the time when the pestilence reigned, and complained to my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, that there was a shortage in the city, because nothing was supplied to us, so we had to suffer three kinds of plague, pestilence, hunger and frost. In addition, | indicated that | would have to share and access the grain and wood of His Electoral Grace with the citizens 2c. His Electoral Grace graciously wrote to me with these words: You should also take hold with me, dear Doctor 2c. On such words | will now dare to help the poor. 


Give, and it shall be given unto you again. Luc. 6, 38. 


This is a certain saying that makes people rich and poor. Those who do not give, and think to leave their children much behind and after them, the same keep nothing. It is a common saying that will probably remain true: De male quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres; unb roie bie Italians say: Male quaesit, male perdit Uebel gewonnen, Ubel zerronnen. Unjustly good does not talk, does not come to third heirs. Again: Who gives there gladly, to him is given; that receives the house. Therefore, dear Kathe, he said, we have no more money, so the cups must follow; one must give, if we want something else.

502 


25. interpretation of the saying of Isaiah (Cap. 30, 15.): In silence and hope you will be strong. 


This saying was interpreted by D. M. Luther in 1541 over the table: If thou wilt learn to overcome the greatest, most dreadful and most shameful enemies, which otherwise may well devour thee, and also harm thee in body and soul, against which one should buy him all manner of weapons, and give all money to learn this art, then know that there is a sweet, lovely herb which serves for this purpose, that is called Patientin. 

Yes, you say, how can | get such medicine? To this is answered: Take the faith before thee, which saith that no man can hurt thee without the will of God: but if it be so, it is of God's kind and gracious will: so that the enemy himself doeth him a thousand times more hurt. For out of this flows love for us Christians, which says, "I will do him all good for evil, and cast fiery coals upon his head. This is the armor and harness of Christians, that they may smite their enemies, who seem like the great mountains, and otherwise cannot be overthrown, or won with iron and steel. This same love learns to suffer all kinds of things. 


26. comfort against many enmities. 


One of them said that he lived peacefully with everyone, did no harm to anyone, and kept quiet and withdrawn, and yet many people were hostile and angry with him. Then said D. M. Luther said: "Be patient, and do not give cause for this. Dear, what do we do to the devil? What is wrong with him that he is so hostile to us? If he does not have that which our Lord God has, he is so vehemently angry with us that he burns with hatred toward us. Therefore, if God gives you food, eat; if he gives you fasting, be patient. If he gives you honor, accept it; if he gives you shame and harm, endure it. If he throws you into prison, suffer it; if he wants to make you a lord, follow him; if he throws you down again, respect it and do not worry. 

Item: No one will harm me; he will be harmed before he dies. | do not sin by tolerating and suffering such things, but he who harms me harms me. 


Cap. 14: Of good works. § 25-30. 


503 


Patience is necessary everywhere. (Cordatus No. 249 and No. 466.) 


| must have patience with the devil, | must have patience with the enthusiasts, | must have patience with the Scharrhansen, | must have patience with my servants, | must have patience with Kathe von Boren, and there is still so much patience that all my life wants to be nothing else but patience. 

"By being still and hoping you would be strong." (Is. 30, 15.] Be patient, suffer and hope, and do not despair in conscience. 


Sometimes you have to dissimulate and suffer a little. 


One must suffer an evil branch for the sake of the. For the sake of the tree, for the sake of the body, for the sake of the body, for the sake of the body. 


29 On the saying of the Psalm: Commit thy way unto the LORD, and hope in him; D. M. Luther made this verse: 


Silence, sorrow, avoid and forbear. Your distress alone complain to God. 

In God never despair. Your happiness comes every day. 


30. from the remedy. 


A Christian suffers violence, and does not resist evil; whether he may nevertheless use the right, and what it permits and allows him? Answer: A Christian always suffers from the authorities, and only from the authorities, because they always persecute Christ and God, that is, the law and the gospel. But | also call those who rely on the office of the authorities, as not to be resisted; otherwise, if anyone resists or is able to resist and protect himself, he needs the authorities to protect him and stand by him. Therefore, if the authorities are for him or against him and act, a Christian does it or suffers it, and it follows that a murderer or highwayman who is superior to one is like the authorities against him. But a fainting murderer, who is too weak, is under him as under an authority. 


504 


The law is for him and protects him. For violence thou shalt suffer, but justice thou shalt not forsake: for one thing is violence, and another is justice. 


31 Dr. M. Luther's rhyme of one. 


In luctu gaudium, In gaudio luctus, Gaudendum in Domino, Lugendum in nobis. In Traure" Freud, In Freuden Trauern; Fréhlich im HErrn, Traurig in uns sein. 


32. bon vindictiveness. 


The first anger is the best, so that the good deeds are not lost; but man does not do that, but continues and relies on men. Again, the first atonement is the best, so that not so much evil may happen; but a man always continues, does not let up, wants to take revenge; but if one wants to live, one must finally get along. For war cannot last for ever, nor be eternal, if the land cannot be built, nor provisions be left. How are we then so senseless, mad and foolish through the devil's instigation and activity, since we must at last reconcile ourselves with harm, and depart from each other as friends and part, since all good deeds are lost? 


33. against revengefulness. 


Have you not at least learned that when you do harm to someone, it must unfortunately happen to you a hundred times over? What happened to one of the nobility of G., who was the chamberlain and councilor of a prince, certainly harmed many; at last he had to punish himself and kill himself horribly. Therefore, if you are in a great, high office, where many people must be annoyed and offended by you, against your will; do not seek revenge, but what gives or interprets a right, follow it and execute it. For to suffer injustice, and to control and resist wrath and vengeance, makes and keeps a good, safe, and cheerful conscience; but vengeance 


Cap. 14: Of good works. § 30-36. 


505 


must always make a guilty, restless and evil conscience. This is not lacking. 

What is it now? Dear, what do you gain? By striking another, you wound or pierce yourself. But he suffers the punishment of injustice with a cheerful heart, but you suffer the guilt of revenge with a wounded conscience; therefore you harm yourself most of all when you harm another. Therefore, let our Lord God take vengeance, that he may punish the wrong publicly; he will certainly not give it to anyone, no one will escape him. It is said, like a sheep to the slaughter; not, like a cry to war. Christ was a sheep before Pilato, not a tyrant; so shall a Christian be. 


The death of the saints is more devout than their life. 


| wanted, said D. M. Luther, that the adversaries would kill me, because my death would be more useful to the church than my life. So Samson the Philistine killed them rather when he died than when he lived. Judg. 16:30 For this reason | would gladly go to war with our prince against the Turk; if | were to remain dead, then the Turk would also be destroyed. 


35) How to do good deeds. 


One of them apologized and said that he wanted to help the people, to serve and to do good, but their ingratitude put him off. Then said D. M. L. said: "Charity and good deeds should be done secretly, not gloriously; they should be done quietly and without a request for enjoyment, and for the sake of God's honor and the neighbor's good. 


What works please God or not. 


In all works one should look to God's word; therefore, which works are done by and according to God's command, they are not our will, but we are only God's instrument and tool through which He works; they are not ours, but God's. As the works of the law are called and are called, which are done and are done by commandment. 


506 


Cap. 14: Of good works. § 36-43. 


507 


and commandment of the law, not voluntarily.) otherwise need our help, and so suffer hardship that 


Therefore, all works that are not done by God's command are works of our hands and are done without God's word; they are ungodly and condemned, especially if one thinks that he will be justified before God by them. 

The righteous does good works not by force, but voluntarily, in honor of God who commanded it, and for the service and benefit of his neighbor; for he can do nothing else, just as a good tree brings forth good fruit by nature. Therefore, these two kingdoms at the end of the world are the two last abominations, the priest and the Turk. The one is the rule of the priests; the other is the rule of lies. Therefore the end of the world is near at the door, it wants to fail. 


37. works do not deserve bliss. (Contained in Cap. 13, § 50.) 


38: Luther's speech of protection by a lenient hand. 


M. Johann Holstein, D. Martin Luther's table companion, said to D. M. Luther: One can see it on one's hands if one is mild, free of cost and kind; and understood that one could judge it from the chiromantia. Martin Luther answered and said: "That is true, one can see by the hand if one is mild, because one must spend with the hand, one does not give with the feet. 

D. Martin Luther said that at Speier on the beautiful Oelberg, which is in the cathedral, the Jews all carry halberds, which images are quite artistically carved out of stone. Now it was asked: Why do they wear no other weapons than halberds? A mischievous man answered: "They have lent our citizens the spears. He wanted to show that they were running and running wild with the Jewish spear. 


39. three kinds of alms. 


There are three kinds of alms, said the doctor: First, that we give something to maintain the ministry. Second, that we give to poor friends who are related to us, as parents, children, blood friends, and the like. Thirdly, that we also help others and strangers who live with us, or who 


they cannot live without other people's help. 40. four main virtues. 


The ancients, said D. Martin Luther, have set four main virtues: Temperance, which preserves the body; righteousness, which nourishes; manliness or magnanimity, which weathers; and wisdom, which governs all things. 


Ceremonies in the church shall be free. 


It has been an old custom to bury and lay the dead with their faces turned toward the morning and the exit of the sun, for the sake of a secret and spiritual interpretation, which is indicated by this; but this has been done freely, and without law and superstition. Thus all laws in the church should be, namely, free, which no one would be forced to do, as they neither justified nor condemned before God, but were kept only for the sake of respectability and outward discipline. 


42) The righteousness of works. 1) 


D. Martin Luther said that the righteousness of works and hypocrisy is the most harmful pestilence, innate in us, which cannot easily be expelled nor gotten rid of, especially when it is confirmed and confirmed by habit. For all men by nature want to act with God, to reason, and to do enough with their powers and works. That is why Doctor Staupitz used to say: | no longer want to talk about being pious, | have deceived our Lord God too often; | want to ask God for a blessed hour. 


Good works do not make one righteous before God. 


One argued and said: "Evil works condemn, therefore good works make righteous. Then said D. M. Luther said: "The argument is still not suitable Ratione contrariorum, because they are not right against each other. For evil works are fully adequate

45. from the little word merit. (Cordatus No. 511 and 512.) 


Ceremonies, as there are: Eating meat, fasting, clothing, place 2c., are free and allowed in themselves, because they violate neither divine nor natural law, but often make a burned and confused conscience. 


47 Which is the best work. 


The best work on earth is listening to sermons. Common prayers, the week of prayer and processions all aimed at God's giving us rain and blessings for the sake of it, since we called upon the dead saints. But how is it that one does not ask for justice? 


44: Ceremonies during Advent. (Lauterbach, Dec. 1, 1538. p. 185.) 

Luther then said of the ceremonies of Advent, how they were best used for thanksgiving for the incarnation of Christ. For truly unspeakable has been the mercy and love of the Lord s--Ua‘w7rca] toward men, that he took on flesh and blood. This can never : ; ‘ be considered enough with human thoughts.

others in general, did not understand the definition correctly. We praised and said of the rising of the heart, but there was a lack of syntax, so that we could not bring the Deum (the word God) to it: yes, we fled from God, could not freely and surely go before God and ask Him through Christ, in whom all power and certainty of prayer is seen; but have always prayed con- ditionally, with a condition and a certainty, uncertainly, on adventurousness and _ counsel. Therefore, dear brothers, pray in your heart, sometimes also with your mouth, because, by God, prayer sustains the world, otherwise it should be much different. At home | am not so brave and cheerful, for | must always protest beforehand; but in church among the congregation it is heartfelt and also penetrates. 


2. about prayer and its power. 


As acobbler makes a shoe, and a tailor a skirt; so a Christian should pray. A Christian's trade is prayer. And the prayer of the church is a great miracle. In our time, three of them have been raised from the dead: I, who have often lain deathly ill; my housewife Kathe, who was also deathly ill; and M. Philippus Melanchthon, who lay deathly ill in Weimar in 1540: although deliverance from illness and bodily dangers are bad miracles, they should be noted because of the weak in faith. For these are far greater miracles to me, that our Lord God baptizes every day in the church, administers the sacrament of the altar, and saves from sin, death and eternal damnation. These are great miracles to me. 


3. a different one from the power of prayer and from the Lord's Prayer. 

In the Lord's Prayer, the Lord Christ has understood all needs in very few words, what we should ask and how we should ask. But apart from the temptation, no right prayer can be 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, no date, p. 155.) 


The papists say that God understands all the words of those who pray. But Bernard judges differently, saying that God does not hear the words of a prayer if they are not first heard by the prayers. 

The pope has tortured the consciences as a real cane-master and weighed them down without measure. The assembly of his scribblers and religious, priests, monks and nuns, was nothing else than a frog's fiddle, which neither served nor built anything: and if one thought that they had taught and done much, it was only sophistry and deception, without any benefit and fruit. 


4, another one. 


What a strong wall and rampart of the church is the dear prayer, and weapon of the Christians and godly, no one knows and learns, except a Christian and believer who has the spirit of grace and prayer. Oh, how an excellent master has composed these words, in which there is and is an infinite rhetoric and oratory, in which all things, needs and troubles are comprehended! The first three petitions contain and comprehend such great, excellent, celestial things that no heart can ever be able to comprehend them. The fourth petition includes, as if in a bundle, the whole police and economy, the worldly and domestic government, and everything that is physical and temporal, which is necessary for this life. The fifth petition is against the devil's own evil conscience, both inherent and committed sins that weigh down the conscience 2c. Truly, a wise man has made it, and no one can do the same. 

Furthermore, Martin Luther said of the Lord's Prayer that it would not be called prayed if it were spoken without faith, and that we could not pray it without Christ, the mediator. Turks, Jews and godless people can tell it and repeat the words, but they cannot pray it. 


514 


prayed often, but they did not pray. For Christ says to John in the 16th chapter, v. 24: "You have not asked anything in my name before,” since they undoubtedly prayed much and spoke the words: but when the Holy Spirit came, only then did they pray rightly in the name of Christ. Summa, the righteousness of the law makes no one righteous before God: if prayer and reading is a mere work, it is nothing. Righteous prayer of Christians is a strong wall, as God Himself says in the prophet Ezekiel, Cap. 22, 30: "| sought among them if any man would make himself a wall, and stand against the breach against me, for the land, that | should not destroy it; but | found none" 2c. Therefore let us pray, since others blaspheme. 

Anno 1532, den 18. Augusti, da keine Hoffnung mehr der Besserung und Gesundheit des godmen, christlichen Churflrsten, Herzog Johannes zu Sachsen 2c., sprach D. Martin Luther: 1) Dear Lord God, hear our prayer, according to your promise: let us not throw the keys at your feet; for if we become angry with you in the end, and do not give you your honor and interest, where will you stay? Oh dear Lord, we are yours, do it as you will, only give us patience. 

On August 20, he spoke again with great heartfelt compassion about the pious, sick Elector, and said: "Dear God, you have a title that you hear the sighs and prayers of the poor, as David says in Ps. 1:45, 19: "He does the will of those who fear him, and hears their prayer. Dear Lord, let us ask no evil, let us not throw the keys at your door. 


5. a different one from the power of prayer. 


Said D. Luther: Our Lord God always gives more than we ask: if we ask for a piece of bread, he gives us a whole field. When my housewife was sick, | asked God to let her live; so He gives her the Zulsdorf estate in addition, and otherwise gives us a rich, fruitful year. 


1) The two following prayers are already printed in Valch, St. Louis edition, Thxil X, Col. 1519. 


Cap. 15 Of prayer. § 4-8. 


515 


But | think it will be a good pestilence 


follow it, for we are too wicked and cause heresy even among ourselves. 

The doctor said to him, "Doctor, how is it that in the priesthood we prayed so fervently, so diligently, and so often, but now our prayer is quite cold, indeed, we pray seldom? Then the doctor answered and said: "The devil is always driving his servants, who are laborious and diligent in their worship; but the Holy Spirit teaches us and instructs us how we should pray rightly; but we are so cold, and so lacking in prayer, that it does not want to go anywhere. 


6. that prayer should be practiced and practiced daily. 


D. Luther said that he had enough to do with himself every day so that he could pray, and let it suffice him when he lay down that he could pray the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer, and then take a saying or two from the Bible and fall asleep with the same contemplation. 


7. that peasants do not like to pray. 


M. Luther said that the pastor of Holzdorf did not want to let his peasants go to communion, because they did not know the main parts of the catechism. Now the peasants accused him before the Visitatoribus. The priest answered: "Dear sirs, | confess that | did not want them to go to communion, because they cannot pray. Then one of the peasants came out and said, "We are not allowed to pray, because that is why we keep you and give you your wages, so that you may pray for us. 


8. bon of a monk prayer. (Cordatus No. 404.) Monachus super latrinam Non debet orare primam? Deo quod supra, Tibi quod cadit infra. This is how someone answered the devil. 2) 


2) The other half of this number of the Cordatus is found Cap. 24, § 23. 


516 


9. that preachers should put their prayer together. 


Once upon a time in Wittenberg, D. Johannes Aepinus was the superintendent of Hamburg. When he departed from there again, and D. M. Luther blessed and said: | entrust myself and my church in Hamburg to your reverence" prayer; then D. Martinus answered: "Dear Domino Aepine, the matter is of our Lord God, let us sit down together with our Lord's Prayer, then the matter will be decided; otherwise nothing helps: | will pray against the Pope and the Turks while | live. And | like it very much that in the Hamburg ordination you seriously command to pray against the pope and the Mahomet. 


10. of the causes of prayer. (Cordatus No. 1717.) 


The causative cause [causa per se] of prayer is faith, but the incidental [per accidens] is necessity, the form [forma] is seized by undeserved mercy, the matter involved [materia circa quam] is the promise and command to pray, the end [finis] is the answer or deliverance. 

(A single sentence that follows here, torn out of No. 1481 of 


the Cordatus, rst omitted here ; communicated in Appendix No. II.) 


11. prayer of D. M. Luther for a gracious rain. 


(This § is already printed in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, Col. 1498 f. - The second part of this 8 is printed again Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 1591, No. 157. - Cordatus No. 1492. 1493. 1)561.) 

Since he always prayed and sighed at the time of 

drought, he always complained that the stinginess of the peasants prevented the prayer of the Christians, that GOD did not give rain when reminded of His promises. God wants to punish the peasants, but He also knows how to provide for His own in times of famine. Those mammon servants have become quite confident. God has different means to preserve and to destroy. Thus, God could also strike down the Turk with the greatest army by locusts, as one reads in the church history that a very great army of the king

of the Persians, which besieged Nineveh, was chased away by mosquitoes. 1) 

In the time of drought he prayed with his eyes lifted up to heaven: "O Lord God, you have said by the mouth of David your child [Ps. 145:18, 19]: "The Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him with earnestness. He does what the godly desire, and hears their cry, and helps them.” How then, that thou wilt not give rain, because we cry and entreat so long? Well, if you do not want rain, you will give something better, a quiet life and peace. But what will the wicked say to these words [John 16:23], "If ye shall ask anything of the Father in my name" ? | know that from our hearts we cry out to you and groan 2c. And the same night rain came. 


12. from the papist prayer. (Here 24 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 12, § 55, last paragraph). 

After that, he, Martin Luther, began and said how he had toiled in the first week, when the Gospel had begun, with the horis canonicis, which he had omitted and not spoken, before much business. On Saturday he would have locked himself up in his cell, and what he missed that week he would have fulfilled. Finally, however, he would have been so burdened and prevented by business and weakness of his body that he could not have complied with and fulfilled it. And since the others, as Amsdorf, laughed at and despised such prayers, he would also have dropped them, for it would not have been possible for him to do so, and would therefore have refrained from doing so out of despair, and said: "It was a great torture and torment from which we are redeemed through the gospel, and if | had done no good but this alone, | should be thanked for it. No one can believe what a torture it was, how ver- 


1) From the above relation of Cordatus, Kummer seems to have formed his own, which we have already communicated Cap. 2, Z121. The date given there (1542) is certainly incorrect, because Cordatus concluded his diary with the year 1537. The year 1532 was a year of great drought, therefore this speech is probably to be put there. The statement "at this time of drought came many locusts" is a later addition.

and taught; as in the book "Rationale divi- norum" innumerable monstrous things are written. 


13. exhortation of D. Martin Luther's exhortation to prayer. 


In 1539, January 6, on the Feast of the Three Kings, Martin Luther exhorted the people to pray diligently against the devil's raging and raging in the blinded papists, who incited the emperor and other kings, potentates and great princes and lords against the gospel. They are, he said, mad and foolish with their blasphemy, and still want to defend it as right. On the other hand, we provoke God's wrath with our great wickedness and ingratitude. Therefore, repent, amend, and pray that God will judge, guide, and keep the emperor's heart, which he has in his hand, for the planting of the Gospel, so that he will not wage war against the revealed teachings of the Gospel, to preserve the great, shameful abominations, errors, and excesses of Pabstism and its worms and vermin. For we have, by the grace of God, the true, pure Word of God, the sacraments, and how to live a proper Christian life, along with fine Christian ordinances. Therefore, let us pray diligently and repent in this time of grace, that we may not be condemned with the world. And thus concluded: Dear God, 1) govern me, that with spiritual eyes | may recognize and confess my inherent sickness and weakness, and thus be led to the right knowledge of Christ, and be governed, cleansed and sanctified by your Holy Spirit, amen. 


14. to ask for peace. 


Anno 1539, Sunday Reminiscere, D. M. Luther made an earnest exhortation to ask for peace in these very perilous times, since we have had peace in a most marvelous way for twenty years; since no time, when the Gospel is preached 


1) This prayer is already printed, Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, Col. 1505. 


and all estates. Rather, give us a strong pestilence, in which the people are pious, and religion, police and economy, the church, true pure doctrine, secular and domestic government are not so devastated and violated, corrupted nor adulterated. 

Item: In the same year, on the 15th of March, there was talk about the fury, rage and fury of the papists, who described and gathered war people in the country of Bohemia under a foreign name. Then Luther said: "Lord God, give us peace, spare us, and do not let us be repaid for our sins: we are too wicked, ungrateful and secure, since Satan does not sleep. They can soon invade this land and destroy everything, for it has no fortified city or castle inside; everything is open to them. But | am glad that we are not the first to attack, and if we were to remain in this little country and be strangled, the noise would then continue to spread across the Rhine, Bavaria 2c. We Saxons are weak, sit among thorns, have evil neighbors as patrons, the M[ainz] and H[archduke] G[eorg]; but God is the supreme patron, who says: My will shall be done. Even though we should be more pious, he has patience with us, only that we do not despise his grace and word. 

Well then, if they attack us, God grant us patience: if we bet a penny, they must bet a florin; for they have hair, we are bare. The LORD will terrify the Amorites and defend Jacob, as Moses says. If God were not for us and on our side, we would have been discovered long ago; and since they are about to strangle us and kill us, they will not gain much nor accomplish much. 


15. Asking for peace. 


Doctor Martin Luther read a letter that M. Philip had written to him, as it would be on the Colloquio; and said: what Philip-. 


2) This prayer is already printed, Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, Col. 1489.

pus writes, that has hands and feet, authority and gravity, is important, in few words; as | notice from his writing, so | think it will be a war. For the papists would like it, but they do not have so much courage, so ours cannot; so that it would be. Well then, let it go in nomine Domini, in the name of the Lord, | will let God rule, and | will be Crito in the game and Homo pax. 1) We want to ask God to change our adversaries; we have a right good cause: who would not want to fight pro Sacris, for the sanctuary (which is God's word, which sanctifies everything), to lose life and limb, goods and blood? Moreover, the secular rights and political orders are also right, for our people have always and still ask for peace and confess that they would be provoked and provoked in such a way that they would have to protect and defend themselves and their subjects against unjust violence. But they do not want to give peace. 

But the sissy at Mainz wreaks all misfortune, and Hseinz] Mordbrenner continues in his malice. Therefore, our people must answer promptly and immediately. It is not good to wait long; it is better to come first, before others come. If | were a landgrave, | would bet the three of them, and either perish or kill them, because they do not want to give peace in a very good and just cause. But it is not for me, as a preacher, to advise such things, much less to do them. If they sincerely desired peace without falsehood, they would have given it immediately from the beginning, and not delayed twelve days. At last he said, "This letter was given ten days ago; it will now be decided how it is to be. May the eternal merciful God give His grace to it. Let us pray and watch, for Satan truly does not sleep nor celebrate. 


16. an exhortation to give thanks for peace. 


On May 11, on the Sunday Vocem Jucunditatis 1539, D. M. Luther exhorted the people to give thanks that God had given peace this year. For we see publicly, 


1) In ?1autu8 Irinurni". 4, 2. 94 ff. (Férftemann.) 


Cap. 15: Of prayer. §15-18. 


521 


he said that God is watching and still resists the bloodthirsty papists, who rage and rage against us out of devilish hatred, and every year get pregnant and thirst for our blood, which God has often put to shame and will continue to do so; as the dear God Himself has now miraculously made peace, in that the godless man Duke G[eorg] has been killed. Therefore, we should thank God for this, pray and repent, for there is no peace to be hoped for: because the Pope reigns and the Gospel shines, hatred and disunity will last forever and will not cease. God protect us from bloodshed. This is what we should ask for. 

When the same time was said about the peace that was made at Frankfurt, D. M. Luther said: "I cannot think how peace can be made between us and the papists. M. Luther: "| cannot think how peace can be made between us and the papists, for neither part yields to the other, and there is an eternal war between the seed of the woman and the old serpent. They do not tire of each other, as secular kings, princes and lords do; when they have tired of each other, they make peace for many years. Such conditions and means do not apply in this matter, for we cannot depart from the confession of the right, true Christian religion and the Word of God, which they insist upon. In turn, they do not want to let go of their idolatry and abominations. The devil does not want to cut off their feet, so Christ wants to preach and spread his word unhindered. Therefore | cannot think and hope for any decency or peace between Christ and Belial. 


17. world peace. (Cordatus No. 1002.) 

Civil peace is a very great gift of God on earth, but it is a very great abuse of it when everyone lives in peace, as he pleases, against God and against the authorities. Oh, how the nobles, peasants and citizens will pay for it one day, like the Hungarians and Austrians. 


18. from unity. 


There was talk of quarrelsome jurists and despisers of theology; then D. M. Luther spoke: 


522 Cap. 15 Of prayer. § 18-22. 523 


By unity we take too small things and goods, as the pagan says; but discord and dissension is dangerous and harmful, especially in schools, professions, high arts, and the same professors, since one should and must reach out and kiss the hand of the other. But if we bite and devour one another, let us take care that we are not consumed among ourselves. Therefore let us pray and fight, for the word of faith and the prayer of the righteous are the mightiest weapons: so God himself sends his holy angels round about them that fear him, Ps. 34:8. We shall fight, for we are under one Lord of hosts and princes of war; therefore with one hand we must build, and in the other hand we must wield the sword, doing both to teach and to defend. 

It must have been very serious, since the Jews led the trowel in the hand and walled, and soon twitched the sword; therefore we may well pray against the old serpent, which stabs Christ in the heel. Now is the time to watch, for it is for us; for they will join with the Turk against us. They truly mean us, we may and must dare, for the Antichrist will war against the saints of God and prevail, as Daniel says. Externally, we are in great danger from traitors, for the papists will take it upon themselves to corrupt and smear all our captains with money. A donkey loaded with money can do anything, as the pagan Cornelius Tacitus writes of the Germans: We have taught them to take money. There is no more faith nor belief on earth. The Welsh and the Spaniards conspire and hold themselves together against us, only for the sake of their own enjoyment. 


19. disunity in churches among the servants. 

(Lauterbach, Feb. 2, 1538, p. 21.) On this day came the request of a pastor who complained about the disobedience of his deacon. Luther answered: Ah dear God, how hostile is the devil to us that he stirs up even the ministers of the Word with hatred against one another! The devil always lights one fire after another. Let us extinguish it by praying, by reconciling and yielding. 


We may disagree in morals, but there must be unity in true doctrine. Not like the papists, who are very unequal both in doctrine and in life. Afterwards he sighed with uplifted eyes: "Lord God, how great is the ungodliness and ingratitude of the world, which so neglects and persecutes your ineffable grace; even we, who boast ourselves evangelical and know that the word of God is genuine, as the testimony spoken from heaven indicates (Matth. 17, 5.): "This is my dear Son, hear him!" But we hold this most holy gospel of Christ in such low esteem, as if it were a word from Terence. 


20. of the power and ability of prayer. 


Praying from the heart, and poor people's lamentations raise such a clamor that all the angels in heaven must hear it. Our Lord God must have great ears and a sharp, silent hearing. 


21. exhortation of D. Martin Luther's Exhortation to Pray Against the Devil and Papists. (Lauterbach, Dec. 25, 1538, p. 194.) 


On December 25, Christmas Day, Luther preached at noon, after which he exhorted to public prayer for the course of the Word against all attempts of Satan, especially against the bloodthirsty papists, who would be the most bitter opponents, could not provide us with anything better than that they daily counsel against God's Word and the public peace. Therefore, you who are pious, pray, repent. Do not only hear the word, but also live according to it, so that we may put a little candle 2) or incense on our Lord God, because all the world, papists, epicureans, nobles, peasants, cause so much trouble, who live freely according to the flesh, without all faith and love. They accept everything from God without thanksgiving, serving no one. 


22 The prayer will surely be heard. 


All who call upon God in right faith with earnestness from the heart will certainly be heard, and

34, whether foreign faith helps anything? 


One of them asked, "Does someone else's faith help you to salvation? Luther answered: "Stranger's faith is only useful to him who has it; but | will not be saved because of your faith, for no one can believe for another; each one must believe for himself, and through this [his own faith] he will be saved. But the prayer of another, which is done in faith, helps and promotes, yea, obtains, that another may be converted, and receive his own faith, and so be saved. 

Therefore, it is said that Paul was converted and saved through the prayer of St. Stephen. However, he was not pleasing before God, nor did he become God's dear child and a chosen instrument of Christ for the sake of Stephen's faith; but through Stephen's faith, through prayer, Paul obtained faith from God, through which he became blessed before God. Thus, many are still preserved through prayer, as we prayed M. Philippum alive in Weimar, 1) otherwise he would have died. Prayer does much. 

Then someone said, "Was Paul converted long after Stephen's death? No, said Luther, he was converted in the same year. He was still a fine young man, and learned: he stood firm and firm on the righteousness of the law, which says: whoever does this will live inside. Therefore, he thought that it pleased God that he consented to the death of St. Stephen by keeping and preserving the clothes of the witnesses while he was being stoned to death. 2) He was not a man of the law. It is impossible that God will not accept the prayer that is in faith. 


1) Cf. § 2 of this Cap. and Erl. Vol. 56, 226, Luther's letter to his wife, July 8, 1540. 2) In all editions: his clothes. 


Whether he does not always do it, nor soon gives what one asks, that is a different matter. God does not give according to the measure, manner and time that is prescribed for him, he wants to be free; but he heaps it up and shakes it, as Christ says Luc. 6, 38. 

So he did to St. Augustine's mother. She asked God that the son be converted. But it would not happen anywhere. She appealed to all the scholars to persuade him and persuade him to do so. Finally, she suggested to him that she wanted to free a Christian virgin for him, so that she would draw him back and bring him to the Christian faith and baptism; but it would not work either. But now that our Lord God comes, he comes well and makes such an Augustinian out of him that he is now called a light of the church. That is why St. James says Cap. 5, 16: "Pray for one another, for the prayer of the righteous is heard" 2c. This is also one of the best sayings in the same epistle. It is a strong thing about prayer, if only we could believe it; for God has joined and bound Himself to it. 


35. Christ directed the prayer to the Father alone. (Cordatus No. 70.) 


Before his glorification, Christ did not want to be glorified. That is why he prescribed the Lord's Prayer to the apostles in the Jewish way, since it only worships the Father. But now we will not be heard if we do not ask through Christ. 


36. Wider 3) the temptations should not be prayed.

Many have been heard by God, but afterward have fallen into great temptations, out of which they could hardly have come. 


3) This heading is wrong. It should read: To contestations etc. 


530 Cap. 15: Of prayer. § 37-41. 531 


The children’s prayer. 


Jonas said that his little children prayed against the Turk, whether they did not understand what they were praying for. Luther said, "The children's prayer is good, because they still have pure voices and have not had an opponent who contradicts them and holds oppositum. 


38. Bon quite a few sayings. 


Martin Luther was asked if these sayings were against each other, since God says to Abraham: "If | find ten of them (in Sodom), | will not destroy them", Gen. 18, 32. and since Ezekiel Cap. 14, 14. says: "Even though Noah, Job and Daniel would pray, | will not hear them" 2c., and Jerem. 7, 16. does God tell the prophet not to pray for the people? To this the doctor answered and said, No, they are not against one another; for in Ezekiel it was forbidden them that they should not pray, which was not with Abraham. Therefore one must see where the word is. When God says: You shall not pray, you may well stop. As | may say: Do not pray for my Andres N., if you already pray, it will not help. But if | say: If someone asks for my Andre N., that would be different. 

Another said: "How can we know now, when we should pray, whether God will hear us? Said D. Martin Luther: We do not have the word or command that we should not pray; if we did, we should not pray, but we have it that we should pray. That is why | would have stopped praying against the Turks long ago if | hada command, but because | do not have one, | have to pray, even though it seems as if we should never pray. 


39. as D. Martinus Luther prayed. (Contained in Cap. 15, § 6.) 


40. By prayer one should command God everything. 


In 1543, Luther said: "You should command God to do everything, He will do it well; as he finely says Isa. 46, 3. 4. 


to me, you of the house of Jacob, and all the rest of the house of Israel, who are carried in the womb, and lie in the mother; yes, | will carry you to old age, and until you grow gray. | will do it, | will lift, and carry, and save"; therefore only lay it on me, dear one, command me. So also St. Peter says 1 Epist. 5, 7: "Cast all your care upon him." That is a fine comforting saying; and Psalm 55:23: "Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall supply thee: he shall not leave the righteous in trouble for ever." These are beautiful, comforting sayings. But we want to do and accomplish everything, since we are not able, indeed, it is impossible for us. We want to lift and lay, and forget our Lord God in the process; so we sink, and make evil worse. Yes," you say, "| have commanded him, but he will not come: he consumes too long. Wait for the Lord; you must wait and endure, for he will surely come at last. It is better to wait for the Lord than to go to the side of the pope or the bishop of Mainz, since there is no hope that they could help, for they themselves are poor sacks of maggots. 

Eck is now dead, as they say. | am sorry for the loose man: | would have hoped that he would have recognized his blasphemy; but he has not done so, but has been accustomed to boasting, flaunting, fornication, whoredom, 2c., has become obsolete in it, and out of constant practice and habit has become a nature, and thus [he has] died and corrupted. What does he get out of it, but death? nothing more; although eternal death is still behind. 


41. the power of prayer. 


In 1542, Martin Luther spoke of the power and benefits of prayer and told this story: "When the king of Persia besieged the city of Nasili 1)) and the bishop saw that he was too weak for human help and could not stand or protect himself, 


1) Perhaps "Nisibis", which was em episcopal see at the time of the Arian disputes. Cap. 2, §121, Lauterbach p. 201 states "Nineveh", in the old table speeches "Edessa"; Cordatus No. 1493 also Nineveh. Cf. Appendix No. II. 


532 


and could not protect or defend the city against such 


Cap. 15: Of prayer. 


§ 41-47. 533 


That is why another said: To a righteous prayer 


a mighty king, he climbed the wall, lifted up his hands |pelongs Dimidium Sphaerae, Sphaeram, cum 


to heaven, and prayed; then he made a cross over the enemies. Then the eyes of all the horses were full of gnats, and [the Persians] fled out to the land. 1) So God could also order and direct the heart of the Turk, if we only prayed diligently in faith. 


42. With prayer, one must stop. 


When Martinus prayed for rain, but none came, he said: God hears us, but he does not do otherwise than like the unjust judge in the Gospel Luc. 18, 2. ff, he does not hear, but one overpowers him with constant perseverance. 

(Here 11 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 6, § 7.) 


43 A prayer of D. M. L. that the last day may come. 


(This § is already printed in Walch, St. Louis Edition, Part X, Col. 1520. Originally it comes from the second sermon on the 4th Sunday after Trinity, Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XII, 735, § 18, and is somewhat changed from it. 


44. God demands the heart in prayer. 


One says of a monk, spoke!). Martin Luther, who daily hid in a corner, fasted and prayed a lot. When he was tired and weary from praying, he asked God if it was enough that he prayed for and for? Then he heard a voice saying to him: "Speak to me mediam Lunam, Solem et Canis iram 2); that is, Cor. And it is also thus. God does not want to have only outward giving, but to be called upon with all the heart: and it is not to be said how hard a thing it is to pray from the heart. 


1) Thus changed by us, instead of: "and flown out to the country". 

2) In this and the following Latin saying is the same word play. The half moon is 6, the middle letter of 80l is 0, the middle letter of irn is R. - A half circle is 6, a circle is O, the beginning of coma - H, so in both cases Oor. 


principe Roma, exigit a nobis summi creator olympi; that is, Oor, because the prayer must go from the heart. 


45. you have to pray and what it create. 


Dear God, said Doctor Martin Luther, we must pray. | think that if we prayed earnestly, the Turk should not break off anything from our people now. When a man asks a king or a prince for something, 3) he thinks himself so proud, and pleases him well: why then do we not let Christ say: Dear, kneel before me, lift up your hands and your heart, ask only what you want, | will give it to you, only have no doubt about it. 


Christians pray forever. (Cordatus No. 1182.) 

A Christian always prays, whether he is sleeping or awake. For his heart is always praying, and groaning is a great and powerful prayer. For thus says [the Lord] (Ps. 12,) [6.], "Because the poor groan, | will arise, saith the Lord." Thus a Christian also always carries the cross, even though he does not always feel it. 


47. How the lawyers should start their trade with prayer and the fear of God. 


D. M. Luther said: "Affects are like a painted glass: as it falls before one's eyes, so he sees it; for he sees nothing as it is in himself, or as it has a form. So the lawyers in their schools also know what is right, indeed they teach it to others; and this cannot be blamed, because they are in theoria. But when it comes to the practica, the painted glass is soon there and the affects, and hinder it; be it Cupid, Odium, Avaritia, or whatever it may be. 

Therefore, a lawyer must be a pious man who prays diligently and says, "Dear God, | am to do justice; help me not to be lacking, nor to be too close to anyone. This do 


3) So Stangwald instead of: requested. 


534 


But they do not, for they think they can do it all. Ifa matter comes before them, they soon answer, "The matter can be helped; and God is not thought of there. But we poor theologians must first kneel down with the church and pray if we want to preach a sermon. But the lawyers are not allowed to pray, as the peasants of Holzdorf 1) said; that is why things are so bad in the secular government. 


48. of the father-our and its power. (Cordatus No. 1657.) 


The Lord's Prayer binds people together, therefore it becomes the strongest prayer. 


49) That one must stop with prayer. 


Doctor Martin Luther said that the church was preserved by prayer, because prayer had done the best for the church until now; 


1) Cf. Cap. 15, § 7. Stangwald also correctly has "Holtzdorff", i.e. Holzdorf near Schweinitz, instead of "Golsdorf". 


Cap. 15 Of prayer. § 47-49. 


535 


therefore it must still be prayed. Therefore Christ says: "Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. First of all, he wants us to ask when we are in temptation: for God often hides Himself somewhere, and will not listen, yes, He will not let Himself be found; so then one must seek Him, that is, stop by praying. If one then seeks him, then he closes himself up in a closet: if one then wants to enter to him, then one must knock: if one then has knocked once or twice, then he interrogates a little. Finally, if one knocks too much, he opens and says, "What do you want? Lord, | want this or that. Then he says, "Get it for yourself. So he must be awakened. | believe that there are still many devout people here who pray very diligently, although there are also many bad boys here. Therefore this saying: "Ask" means nothing else than: ask, shout, scream, knock, rumble. And this one must do for and for without stopping.

Through God's word and the article of justification, sadness must be dispelled. One reads an example in church history that Julianus, in order to test the constancy of his Christian soldiers, ordered them to be beheaded. When they were brought in, they hold a youth among them who asked that he be beheaded first. As he was now happily offering his neck to the executioner, it was ordered that he be set free. When he stood up, he said:

And he turned to the king and said, "After God | have no one better than you, and | would gladly be obedient to you, if it were not against God. 5, 29: "One must be more obedient to God than to men". So he was executed. Oh that we could also be so constant when it comes to this! said D. M. Luther. And he said further: "If the authorities themselves are enemies and against the word of God, then we give way, sell and leave everything, flee from one city to another; as Christ commanded: for the sake of the Gospel one should neither make a noise nor resist, but one should suffer everything. 


3, what Christ requires of us. (Contained in Cap. 7, §100.) 


4. what follows faith. 

If you believe, you speak and cannot be silent: if you speak, you suffer and are afflicted: if you suffer, you are comforted. So faith, confession, and the holy cross belong to each other, and are proper to a godly man. 

(The following Cordatus No. 1432. 1433.) 

A Christian is said to have the greatest strength in the greatest weakness, the greatest wisdom in the greatest foolishness, and just as he is another in feeling, so he is entirely another in faith. 1) 

With good works we give interest to God, through faith we receive the inheritance. 


5. denial of the word. 

A priest in our principality took a wife in marriage; then, when he was tired of the wife, he left her and went back to the principality, to the lands of Duke George. When his magistrate heard of this, he sought him out and put him in prison. Therefore 


1) Instead of <1si is to be read Was. Meaning: The Christian feels weakness and foolishness, strength and wisdom he believes. 


with him? He answered: If the captain did not want to behead him, he would like to hang him; one would be as much as the other. 

Anno 38, on the 5th of September, D. J. Sch[urfs] was remembered, who in the beginning had been quite favorable to the Gospel, but now he had been so taken in and persuaded by his canon and Drecket that he had become a great cavilator and blasphemer; so that he disliked the whole church, with all its servants, for the sake of digamy and ordinances, that the church servants were again freed, illegitimate, and not ordained, as the canons set. Then said D. M. L.: | am sorry for the good friend that he is so blind, and gives more to human laws than to God's word and authority. Seven years ago | prophesied about him in the presence of M. Philippi: "This man (I said) will fall and will hardly come back. This prophecy of mine has come true, and is now coming true, not without great heartache. Well, | had to get used to the cases; for the Lord Christ does not do otherwise, who makes disunity among father and children, among husband and wife. So we must take it for granted that the fault is not ours. 


6. every Christian is guilty of confessing Christ. 

Every Christian, especially those who publicly hold office in Christendom, should be ready for himself at all times, so that he can stand where it is necessary to confess his Lord Christ and to represent his faith, and always be prepared against the world, devils, mobs, and whatever he is able to muster. But no one will do this soon, unless he is so sure of the doctrine that even if | myself become a fool (since God is for me) and recant, or deny my doctrine, he will not step away from it; but say: Even if Luther himself, or an angel from heaven, teaches otherwise, he is maligned, Gal. 1, 8. 9.

538 


8 Duke Henry of Saxony's Confession of the Gospel and its Consistency. 


D. M. Luther said that Duke Henry of Saxony, Elector Moritz and Augusti father, would have been a pious and constant prince. For when our Lord God attacked Duke Georgen, his brother, and punished him so that his sons all died in marriage, for he (Anno 1537, on 18. Januarii, his eldest son, Duke Hans, died, and Anno 1539, on 24. Februarii, Duke Frederick, the other son, died): he had sent to his brother, H[Duke] Henry, to Freiberg and had him informed that if he wanted to leave the gospel, he would make him heir to his hands and people, otherwise he would give the land to the emperor and other people in the will. To this H[archduke] Heinrich answered: By Mary! (which was S. F. G.'s proverb) before | would do this and deny my Christ, | would rather go out of the country with my daughter begging on a stick. He remained steadfast to God's word and shortly thereafter inherited the Meissen land. His brother, Duke George, had to be his faithful guardian and acquire and save wealth for him, and make hima rich prince. Thus God honors those who honor and confess him. And when Duke George's body was led to Meissen for burial, and Duke Henry followed the body as it was driven over the bridge at Meissen, he sang the responsory De divo Martino: Martinus hic pauper, coelum dives ingreditur. 

At another time, M. Luther said: "When this praiseworthy, pious prince was to die, and much had been said to him about the Lord Christ, and he asked whether he also wanted to die on him, he would have answered: | think so, | will not be able to get a better procurator than this one. 


9. how God cares for the confessors of the gospel and graciously averts all danger. 

D. M. Luther told how in 1539 the papists had great practices and war armor. 


Cap. 16: Confession of doctrine and consistency. § 8-10. 


539 


against the protesting estates had intended to exterminate them; so that Duke George of Saxony had said: his brother, Duke Henry, should not rely on the Elector of Saxony and his alliance, because they would see where they would stay on Pentecost. And after Emperor Carl had ordered a meeting of the princes at Frankfurt am Main, where peace was to be negotiated, and Duke Joh. Frederick, Elector of Saxony; Count Palatine Frederick, Elector; Margrave Joachim, Elector of Brandenburg; Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and other princes; and the imperial majesty also sent their councillors of the places; since they only led the protesting estates around with their noses for the sake of peace (for around Bremen and LUneburg nine thousand choice good warriors converged, who were to be used against them. However, the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse had the same men discussed with them by Mr. Bernhard von Mila, a knight, and had them drawn to them, and had given them money in hand. This happened by God's miraculous providence, so that the servants who had been appointed against the Protestants had to be their protectors): 

Suddenly and unawares, Duke George of Saxony died in Frankfurt on that day. When this great link was torn from the chain, all the armor remained. And said D. Luther said: "Thank you, merciful God, that you are awake when we sleep. For in this no one but our Lord God may be praised. The Christians’ prayer has been our wall, that they have prayed the Psalm: Domine, dissipa gentes, quae bella volunt. God will give them war enough. 


10th Elector Hansen's dream in Saxony. (Cordatus No. 1228.) 


The dream of our Elector, which he had at Augsburg, is now beginning to come true. For the mountain he saw falling on Duke G[eorg] was the emperor. This has now collapsed and therefore H[erzog] G[eorg] now humbles himself before our prince.

1. of the sacred sacraments. 


God (said D. Mart. Luther Anno 1531) has often changed his sacraments and signs in the world. For from Adam's time until Abraham, the Church has had for sacraments the sacrifices, that fire fell from heaven, and set the sacrifices on fire and burned them. This has been much a glorious sign, because we have. After that Noah had the rainbow as a sign. Then Abraham was circumcised. From that time circumcision continued until the Lord Christ. From the time of the Lord Christ, baptism has lasted until this day. The signs have gradually diminished, but the cause and the work have increased. 

But the sign and the promise are to be bound together, not torn apart. And he is far wrong who would let the sign stand and go, and thus say, God is the God of the Gentiles; therefore | will not let myself go. Or that a Jew would have said: | am the son of Abraha, therefore | will not be circumcised. For the promise is always that the seal and the letter shall be together; for the seal or signet that is on the letter

Luther, Gevattern zu bitten. 17. from the baptism power. 118) Whether to baptize with warm water. 9 Of the uncertainty of baptism. 0. confirmation of infant baptism. 1) Whether the children believe and are baptized rightly. 2) Whether baptism is right, even if one does not believe. 23) What is and is not to be done at baptism. 4. of the benefits and power of baptism. 5. an answer to D.

Anton Lauterbach, Pfarrherrn zu Pirna, given. 28) That the baptism of infants should not be reproached nor despised. 29. a form of baptizing the Jews. 


The promise is confirmed and reaffirmed and assured. None is valid without the other. One does not believe a blanket, since only on bad paper a seal is printed, and nothing is written on it; again, a bare writing or prescription, to which no seal hangs, is also valid nothing. 

This is how itis with the sacraments, therefore one should strive for baptism, because the word and the sign are connected together. If you have the letter, have it sealed. The promise, joined with the water, makes a baptism. Abraham has God's word, and also circumcision: so baptism is also water, fasted in God's word, and gives baptism here as much as circumcision there. Abraham must say: | am circumcised, and in this circumcision the Lord Christ is promised to me. This promise, which does, we also have in the New Testament, that God says: | will be your God, and you will be baptized. But if the promise or the word is gone, then circumcision does not help and is not valid in itself: as, it does not help the Turk today that he is circumcised, because the promise is gone. If that also were gone from baptism, | asked nothing. 


542 Cap. 17. of Holy Baptism § 1-5. 543 


according to the water. Therefore the fathers received the promise that God would be their God, and they were circumcised. 


2 Baptism and the Word are the greatest gifts of God. (Cordatus No. 412.) 

Since a challenged 1) answered: | do not know how | am, | answered him, Are you also baptized? O itis a great gift to be baptized, which neither the Turks nor other unbelievers receive. Moreover, love for the word of God is a great gift of God's grace. Thus Paul gives thanks for the pledge [Eph. 1, 14.]. Then, as he says to Titus [3, 3.]: That we should not serve the lusts and various pleasures, but trust in the living God, that should certainly comfort us. 


3. whether to baptize a baby who is only half-born. (Cordatus No. 935.) 

Those who baptized a part of a child that came forth [in birth] were mistaken according to Aristotle, who said that the whole soul is in the body and in any part of it. If still something should be missing, then the child GOtte is to be ordered. For what is suitable for a bath is also suitable for baptism. 2) 


The power and effect of baptism. (Cordatus No. 1205. 1206. 1207. 

When | once asked my wife if she believed that she was holy, she pondered for a long time and answered: "How could | be holy, since | am such a great sinner? So much has the pope stained our whole being, whose teaching has penetrated our innermost being, that we do not hear with healthy ears that Christ is our Savior, our righteousness, and our peace. 


1) According to Aurifaber, this challenged person was D. Hieronymus Weller. Likewise Bindseil Il, 184. 

2) Luther to Leonhard Beier, Walch, old edition XXI, 1254: No one can be born again who has not yet been born. - Cf. also De Wette IV, 505 f. and Walch XXI, 1288 s. 





It is wonderful that we believe that we are baptized, even Christians, and yet we do not believe that we are holy. For in baptism our sin is condemned and we are given the righteousness of Christ, but we do not believe that we have been made holy. As far as we are men, as far as we are sinners, but because we are baptized and believe, we are holy through Christ. Thus the woman answered. 3) 

Rather, the whole Christian is also holy, because if the devil took away the sinner, where would the Christian be? Therefore, my wife's distinction is no good. He who clings to his baptism with firm faith is truly holy. That is what David calls himself a saint. The papists, who do not grasp the article of the forgiveness of sins, can neither believe nor understand this holiness, and are only annoyed when they hear such things from us. 

Dear, tell me how God should do it with us. He has given the law, and we do not want to be sinners; he has given grace through the gospel and the forgiveness of sins, and they do not want to believe. He whistles and cries, yet it does not help. It is still said [Hab. 2, 4], "The righteous lives by faith." Therefore he who believes is holy. 


5. the testimony of the Lord Christ to children. 


This text speaks of the children, and not of old adult people, as the apostles were, but of the children it says Marc. 10, 14: "Such is the kingdom of heaven"; that is, |am their Christ also, | am promised to them, just as | am also promised to you old adult Jews; but you have become too wise, and do not want to have me. So infant baptism also has a promise and command. For when the Lord Christ says, "Go into all the world and teach the gospel to all nations, baptizing them," he does not mean by the word "nations" to exclude infants from baptism, for God wants to be God to them all, whether they are great or small, young or old. 


3) The following paragraph contains Luther's answer. 


544 Cap. 17. of holy baptism. § 5-9. 545 


Therefore we must not look at this saying, Marci 7. triple baptism. 10:14, with the eyes of a calf, or look at it as a cow ; hack, looks at a new gate; but do with it as one is ae paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Feb. 13, 1538, p. accustomed to say at court: Letters of princes should He ni spoke of the threefold baptism of water, be read three times; that is, read often and many ih gpirit, and blood. 1) The Church of Christ has kept TIMes (op tiiey igs wien EaretUly 290 me shoulg ct these three ways of baptizing.

The children, said D. Martin, they should be 


1) In the original: fluminis, flaminis, sanguinis. 


546 


(The following at Cordatus No. 1148.) 


That God gives His Holy Spirit to little children when they are baptized, we know from the great gifts of the saints who lived in the Church, like Bernard. Likewise, Christ says: Go and baptize all, and makes no mention of age. Here belongs circumcision, which has the same promise as baptism. 


10. benefits of infant baptism. (Cordatus No. 1149-1157.) 


The Anabaptists conclude that no one should be baptized who does not confess his faith. They prove this with Cornelius and thus conclude from the particular to the general. Therefore, nothing follows from this and Peter did not baptize Cornelius because of his faith, but because of the justification of Christ and because of his word and the command of God, for if no one had to be baptized unless his faith was first certain, then no one could ever be baptized. And if | were baptized for the sake of my faith, faith would be greater than the word and command of Christ, by which He commands to baptize. Likewise, [God's] word would have no power at all unless our faith were added to it. This would be to measure the power of God according to our weakness, but this is blasphemy. 

And they [the rebaptizers] say that the children have no reason, as if reason adds to faith. But it is precisely for this reason that children are most to be baptized, because they lack reason, and the less reason there is, the greater the ability to accept faith, because the objects are lacking which most greatly avert the wise. 

Reason is the greatest obstacle in relation to faith, because everything divine seems to it to be inconsistent, that | do not say stupid. In short, if God can give His spirit to adults, He can give it much more to children. 

Since faith comes from hearing the Word, and children also hear the Word of God when they are brought to baptism, they consequently receive faith. This becomes 


Cap. 17. of holy baptism. § 9-11. 


547 


proven by John the Baptist, who, hearing God's word, leapt in his mother's womb. 

Infants were circumcised in the Old Testament, so they can also be baptized in the New: for both signs have the promise of grace and eternal life 2c. Christ commands the little ones to come to him, saying that theirs is the kingdom of heaven. So infants may be baptized. For to all those to whom grace belongs, the sign of grace also belongs. Therefore Christ also blessed them, which surely means to receive someone by grace and to present him to the Father to be sanctified and preserved. And the children who were killed by Herod, did they not belong to the kingdom of God? 

The Anabaptists say that no commandment compels that infants be baptized; but Scripture has nowhere forbidden this, and we have examples which are just as valid as acommandment. And the children do not obtain the forgiveness of sins other than in the church, consequently they must be baptized. And since John the Baptist could be sanctified without the help of reason, God can do the same to others. 

This reason: "The children do not understand the word, therefore the sacrament is not applicable to them", is to be resolved by holding up circumcision, which testifies that grace and faith in the promise is in some, in whom the understanding of the word is not; for its sacraments indicate that the forgiveness of sins belongs to the children. 

Circumcision was a sign of Christ who was to come, but baptism is a sign of Christ who has come. But each of them is a sign of grace and forgiveness of sins. 

When they counter: "If the kingdom of heaven is theirs, then they do not need baptism", one must say: the kingdom of heaven is indeed of the children, but they receive it only in baptism, not before.

First, it is to be considered certain that baptism is God's ordinance, which He instituted for this reason, so that we might know where to find Him. He seeks us, he comes to us, we cannot come to him from ourselves. Therefore, if your conscience makes you anxious and despondent, you have the Word, baptism, absolution, and the Lord's Supper to keep you and seek comfort. Do not go to St. James at Compostel in Hispania, or to any other saint, or to a monastery. So do not seek him, because you will not find him.

Third, what baptism is, namely God's word, water and power, Marc. 16, 16. Joh. 3, 5. 1 Joh. 3, 9. Tit. 3, 5. Eph. 5, 26. And here one must also remember those who call it a dog's bath; item, the Pabst's error. For the barefoot monks say from their Scoto: It is a true baptism, God stands by and baptizes spiritually. Which is darkly spoken. But we say: that he, God himself, baptizes.

(28) That the baptism of infants should not be reproached nor despised. 


One evening, Martin Luther spoke about infant baptism and said: "In the past, many of them had spared the baptism of infants and raised them until they had grown up, out of this delusion and thought that they had seen that the children of Christians had fallen away from their Christianity again and had fallen into an ungodly, wild and desolate life of the world. Then they thought it would be much safer to bring up baptism until they grew up, so that they would not defile baptism with sins. But those who were devout Christians held baptism in high honor. Videbatur quidem pius error, sed occasio malitiae erat; for since St. Augustine and others were thus baptized slowly, they despised baptism altogether, so that they did not want to be baptized afterwards. 

And D. Luther told a story ex Confessione Augustini, who had had a compatriot and playmate, who had also not been baptized; now, when he was deathly ill, he had been baptized. 


1) The place where Lauterbach was pastor at that time is given by Luther Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, Col. 1441, Leisnig. Likewise with De Wette, vol. IV, 671 ff.

When the young man became sick and wanted to die, his parents hurriedly had him baptized.

With this speech he dissuaded Augustine to stop blaspheming and despising baptism. The safest thing to do is to baptize little children.

The use [ritu8] had been until now that they were baptized in a bucket full of water and then dressed in a white robe. From this usage, the Sunday after Easter would be called "white Sunday" [Dominica in albis], and the dead would be clothed in white garments. But baptism means death, and | believe that Christ was also baptized in this way in the Jordan.

Cap. 18: Confession to the ears. § 1.2. 


557 





1. on the abuse of auricular confession in the papacy. 


Doct. Martin Luther said: "That in the confession of the ears of the papists, only the work was considered, and it would have been such a run to confession that one would never have been able to confess enough. For if one remembered something more that he had perhaps forgotten, then he had to confess it again quickly. For one had to confess all sins, so that a priest once said to me: God has commanded and commanded that one should hope in His mercy. And | knew a doctor of law who was so troubled that he went back to the confessor three or four times before he received the sacrament; indeed, when it was handed to him, he said it in one ear. We made the confessors tired, so they made us anxious with their conditional absolutions; for so they absolved: | absolve and absolve you for the merit of our Lord Christ, and for the repentance of your heart, and for the confession of your mouth, and for the satisfaction of your works. 2c. This condition and the appendix caused all misfortune. 

We did all this out of fear that we might be justified and saved before God; we were thus weighed down and overburdened with innumerable human statutes, so that Gerson 1) had to let the consciences loose a 


Those who have never experienced such imprisonment are presumptuous enough to despise and reject all laws. 

Summa, the consciences in the papacy have been so martyred, stung and pecked that no one would believe it now, if we did not have their books and our own experience, which are still alive, as witnesses, who have unfortunately tried it: no one would believe that such a great blindness had existed. And since the pope had neither sinned nor done anything wrong, except in the days of the week of martyrdom and fasting, with confession, he would still be worthy to be torn apart with red-hot tongs. Our people at present know nothing of the prison and torture of conscience, live in great freedom and security, feel neither law nor Christ. 


2. secret and serious cases in confession should be handled carefully and in a Christian manner. 


It is highly necessary that we deal carefully and Christianly with consciences in confession, that secret and annoying cases and things be kept covered and concealed, and that the persons be admonished to true righteous repentance, said D. M. Luther. M. Luther. And he told a case that had

3. whether it is necessary to tell all sins in confession?

in turn, comfort and uplift through the preaching of the Gospel. 

Therefore | say: If she is absolved, | do not know D. Martinus about it, but Christ knows it. Martinus nothing about it, but Christ knows it, with whom she has spoken; for | do not hear confession, nor absolve, but Christ. They shall not draw us to their judgment- seats and hadermarkets. Therefore we have hitherto held above the canon law and justice, and still do, and will no longer leave anything to the secular court in matters concerning doctrine and conscience, nor will we concede anything to them therein, not even in the slightest. They wait for their command, they have enough to do with it, and let us carry out our office as Christ has commanded; that and no other. 

But how would it be if a confessor gave you a confession slip? As was done in Venice by a monk who absolved a woman who had strangled a young journeyman who had slept with her and thrown him into the water. But the monk let himself be bribed with money and betrayed her. The woman protected herself, said she was absolved, and presented the monk's handwriting. The Venetian council recognized and judged that the monk should be burned, but the woman should be expelled from the city. 

Thereupon D. M. Luther: This is a right, good, reasonable verdict, and wise consideration of the council, and the monk is justly burned as a traitor. But if | had given my handwriting to a frightened, fearful conscience, and the judge had it with him, | would rightfully demand it again; as | have done with H[archduke] G[eorg] (of Saxony). For whoever holds other people's letters without a good title is a thief. Now this manuscript is given in matters of conscience, by God and office, which the church has from Christ, through his blood very dearly earned and acquired, therefore a secular judge cannot rightfully hold it. 


5. talking about becoming pious. 


A godly, pious, and honest man, 1) having confessed, said: | will 


Chapter 18: Confession to the ears. § 4-7. 


561 


no longer confess and lie like this, because | always promise and agree that | will improve my life and become more pious, and yet | do not do it, and thus | become a liar and an unman before God. Then said D. M. Luther: It will not do here with us, man remains man, and kind does not leave kind; therefore let us only ask God to grant us a blessed hour, so that we may depart from here. 


6. causes why the auricular confession is used. 


D. M. Luther said: "That the auricular confession was instituted for the sake of these causes in the first place, that the people there might give cause and account of their faith, and confess that they desired the sacrament from the heart. We do not force anyone to do this, although | certainly do not want to refrain from it; for it is not a man who absolves, but God Himself through the mouth of His servant, be he what He wills. 


(7) Whether one who disputes with one in court may be admitted to the sacrament? 


(Lauterbach, Feb. 13, 1538, p. 27.) 


On that day (Feb. 18) | (Lauterbach) asked Luthern about this case: If one who wants to go to the Lord's Supper confessed that he was in dispute with someone, the matter was in court and not yet decided, but he had no hatred against his opponent and was awaiting the verdict of the court,' whether he could be admitted to the Lord's Supper? To this he replied, "The person who is in public disagreement cannot be admitted; for if he were admitted, although he had no private hatred, there would still be an annoyance if he were admitted publicly who lived in public court strife. After that he said he would consider this case and give a more certain answer 2). 


2) From this one recognizes that Luther does not know the answer given by him as finally regarded zero, therefore also a preacher, where such a thing would occur to him, would not have to judge himself according to it. About the answer given later by Luther in 1540, compare Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, Col. 


1) Staupitz. Cf. Cap. 14, § 42 and Walch, Vol. VIII, | 2222. Compare also Cap. 19, § 2. 


Explanation of the Ep. to the Gal. Cap. 5, § 223. 


562 


8. from the absolution. 


The power of God's word is great, said D. M. Luther, that one brother and Christian informs and comforts the other with God's Word. The benefit and fruit of the key and special absolution in auricular confession is very great, by which the conscience can be satisfied, therefore | want to have it without reproach. Under the priesthood | was a poor, sorrowful monk, always in the greatest work and temptation; at last | received comfort from the word of a brother who told me: "I should be confident and hope, our salvation and blessedness is faith in God in Christ; why then would we not trust God, who calls us and commands us to hope? And with this word he comforted me so that | was satisfied. 


9. the church key custom. 


Christ has given the keys to the Church for her comfort, and commanded the ministers to act with them, as He commanded to bind the impenitent, and to loose them that repent, acknowledge and confess their sin, make them sorry, and believe that God forgives them for Christ's sake. 


10) Whether it is necessary to report all circumstances in confession? Then, speaking to D. Martin, said D. Staupitz to D. Henningo 1): Lawyers, theologians and 


1) The reference is to the provost D. Henning Géde at Wittenberg. Férstemann, Vol. Il, 292. 


Cap. 18. of auricular confession § 8-12. 


563 


Doctors should and must report correctly, so they can also advise, help and absolve. But what is said to such persons, they shall keep silent and secret; but if they say it, it shall be nothing. 


11. that confession was a difficult thing in the papacy, from which we are now delivered. 


No one can be absolved in the church unless he promises to amend his life. This includes believing in Christ and changing and improving his life. My sins, which | confess, are that | do not pray so much, nor give thanks so much, and am sometimes angry and curse Duke George. Confession was a miserable carnificina before this time: but how we have such a noble life now in comparison! | was a poor wretch because of confession, you now have master's days (he said to his table companions). But the devil will also cheat you one day, where you do not recognize it. Now we can't believe the dear man Jesus Christ, and | could believe all the shitheads before. Now just strike and kill that we do not want to believe the pious man, Christ. Oh, it would make me very lazy if | were our Lord God.

1. the papists' misconception of the power of the church. (Cordatus No. 1279 and No. 1119.) 


On this the pope, as the strongest foundation of all, has built all his teachings and works, that he is the head over all the churches of the world and over the Scriptures 2c. Therefore he has used and instituted this law, that the cup of the Lord may be ordered according to the judgment of the church; as it is ordered that the sacrament be given only to those who have fasted, although Christ has given it to those who have eaten, ‘in that the boys will not distinguish between the essence, which is the cup, and the accidental, such as having fasted and being full. And that [the essence, the cup] has the commandment [of God] this [the accidental but stands in free will. And fasting, which is a middle thing, serves for reverence, but that violates the institution of Christ, and the Germans would have gone to the Sacrament more drunkenly than once the Corinthians [1 Cor. 11, 20. ff.].

2. one question. 1) 


D. M. Luther was asked this question: Three brothers are at odds with each other about an inheritance: the oldest brother wants to have too much of it, more than may be due to him; the other two do not want to confess it to him, and put it to the council's judgment. Nevertheless, because the matter is before the authorities, they both ask in writing and orally for reconciliation, so that they may be reconciled. Now the question is: Whether these two should be admitted to the sacrament? The doctor answered and said: "Because they have brought nothing to him, and have wanted to reconcile with him, and have not brought anything to him. 


1) Cf. cap. 18, § 7. 

2) The "not" should probably better be missing. The sense would then be: because they have brought the request of reconciliation to the eldest brother etc..

Luther had come, and had sat over the does not rest with them but with the judges. able with the Elector, Duke Philip of Brunswick, and Mr. Hans Ungnade, D. M.

Then Mr. Hans Ungnade started, and said: Doctor, | Miraculously, it has happened that the Sacrament Ould like to ask you something, if you would answer of Christ is instituted under one form.

To this M. Luther had answered: He considered them perjurers, traitors, and evil-doers; for if they confessed that the Lord's Supper was right in both forms, they would not administer it in one form (which is contrary to the order of the Lord Christ). This question has snuffed D. M. in the nose, but lhe has bitten it, and soon started: Mr. Hans Ungnade, | answered E. G. to your question before. | ask E.

Luther was asked what the man should do about this. He answered: "Because they are both one flesh, they should also bear the same cross with each other. However, he was advised to send his wife to her friends in our principality for half a year, waiting to see how this tyranny would end, and if the wife were to stay with the friends for this short time in the name of Christ, the length of time with Duke G[eorg] would not last. 


7. the change of the sacrament. (Lauterbach, May 21, 1538, p. 84.) 

The papists raise their prestige in the Church above the Word by this argument: the apostles changed baptism, therefore the bishops may change the sacraments. The answer to them is: Granted that the apostles changed something, there is a great difference between an apostle and a bishop. The latter is a person directly ordained by God and called with gifts of the Holy Spirit, but a bishop is a person chosen by men to preach the word and to ordain ministers in a certain place. Granted, then, the apostles had the authority, the. Bishops do not have it. As Elijah killed the false prophets, so any pastor may not do. Therefore Paul clearly distinguishes: He appointed some as apostles, some as teachers, some as shepherds (Eph. 4, 11.). Among the apostles there was no primacy, but equality. But an apostle is a general person above the bishop. But the declaration of Peter's supreme power over the bishops is false, because the declaration extends further than what is declared; because thus it is concluded: The pope is the supreme power to decree ecclesiastics, to convoke the rest 1) and to transfer kingdoms [from one to another]. The definition we do not concede to him, because every good definition must be clear, actual, and clearly stated, that in the definition there is neither more nor less than in what is defined. 


1) The opinion of this will be: to convene and assemble conciliums. 








8. common sacramental rites. (Lauterbach, Aug. 5 and Sept. 22, 1538, p. 109 u. p. 135.) 

Some Hungarian students requested Holy Communion in both forms in our church, but because they did not understand German, they requested a separate and special celebration of Holy Communion in Latin. Luther refused them, because they knew Christ's institution, and they should stay with the common order of the church. 

(Sept. 22) On this day some Hungarian students stopped with requests for the sacrament under both forms, but because they did not understand the German language, they wanted it to be given to them privately in Latin. Luther replied: "That would set a bad example in the church if one wanted to communicate privately. Even if they did not understand the words, but knew that it was the true order and institution of Christ, Christ's testament, and that it was given publicly and together in our church through the Word and in the Word, they should not separate themselves from the church in any way, since it would be much safer for their conscience and less annoying to the church if they took the sacrament in public communion. They did so obediently and gave thanks. 


9. sign of an evil conscience. 

Duke Georg is said to have said to one in Dresden: He did not want to force him to take the sacrament under one form; but since he did not want to take it the way it had been ordered and used in the church, he should leave the country. Finally it came to this, if the priest kept quiet about it, he should stay; the priest told him that he should be satisfied, and that nothing should happen to him. There spoke D. M. Luther: This is a sign of an evil conscience, which neither before itself nor behind itself may go, is everywhere challenged by itself. As Jeremiah says, Lamentations 1:2, "All her persecutors hold her evil, and affright her, and find no rest." These are real angustiae, fears; yet H[archduke] G[eorg] would not desist from his transgression, nor come to his heart again. 2) 


2) So all German editions. Bindseil III, 31 offers: redire noluit ad cor suum, which would like to be translated: "still become sincere again". 


570 Cap. 19. of the sacrament of the altar. § 10-13. 571 


(10) Whether a death-row inmate who has not yet been reconciled with the church may be admitted to the sacrament, since he has otherwise been reconciled with friendship and authority. 


In 39, on the ninth of February, a citizen 1) went to the sacrament in Wittenberg, who had committed a death three years ago; however, he had otherwise reconciled and gotten along with everyone, except with the church and its servants and fathers. For this reason, M. Luther punished him publicly in the pulpit, 2) and did not want to admit him to the sacrament, he should also get along with the priest beforehand, and was angry with Magister Frésche, who had admitted him. But if someone, unknowing to the chaplains and church servants, conceals his sin and shame, and is thus absolved and admitted, let him take it on his conscience; then the church servants are excused. 


11) Whether a householder, in case of need, may offer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper to his household. 


M. Luther answered and said: "Not at all; for first of all, there is no vocation nor profession, as Joshua said, 4 Mos. 11, 28: "My Lord Moses forbid them that prophesy" 2c. Deut. 4:6 and Deut. 6:6: "Put therefore all my words into your hearts." Apost. 2, 16. 17. and Joel 3, 1.: "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith GOD, that | will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy" 2c. 

From this it follows that those who are not called may not preach; so it is also reasonable that they may not administer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for the sake of avoiding trouble. For many would therefore despise the ministers of the church, and leave them unattended, if they could help them themselves. 


(12) It was asked, "Were those excused who under the tyrants take the sacrament under one form, since they could not have both? 

M. Luther answered and said: "This question is mean and often asked of me. 


1) Schubart; cf. Cap. 21, § 5, para. 15. 2) Cf. cap. 21, § 5. 





3) But | have answered in the most simple way, namely: Those who are not yet well reported, and still doubt the institution of the sacrament, they may take one form: but those who are certain that both forms are instituted, and take only one form, they do wrong and sin against conscience. For many under Duke George are now thus afflicted and scourged; which tyrant also shall die in his impenitence, because he hath grieved many consciences miserably, would gladly return, and yet cannot. 

Anno 1539, the twelfth of May, D. H[ieronymus] S[churf] 4) sent to D. M. Luthern, and asked that he be allowed to choose a person to administer the sacrament to him, since no deacon pleased him, because they were digami, had two wives, and were not smeared. Then spoke D. M. Luther said, "Let him go to Kemberg or Torgau and take it there. So much | have allowed him. | would give it to him myself, if it were the custom; but | cannot grant him any more, so that the ministry of the church and the ministry of preaching will not be endangered and despised; for it sets a bad example and annoys. 

On Easter Monday, April 7 of the same year, M. Luther ordered D. Jonas, because he himself could not preach, that he wanted to confute and embarrass the pope's argument, who wanted to defend the One Form with the breaking of bread at Emmaus. And when he was asked what ceremonies should be held in} Communion when the Sacrament was administered? He said: "One should indeed keep it as in our Electorate of Saxony 2c. 


13. elevation and abolition of the sacrament. 


What is it necessary, said D. M. Luther, to argue and quarrel much about the abominable idolatry of elevation? M. Luther, much disputing and quarreling about the abominable idolatry of elevation, that the sacrament should be lifted high and shown to the people? since it has no testimony of the fathers, and is 


3) Cf. Walch, old edition, vol. XIX, 2274. 4) Cf. cap. 43, § 115. 


572 


without any benefit, except that the errors were confirmed, namely, worship and transubstantiation, as if bread and wine should lose their essence, and only the form, smell, and taste remain 2c. This is what the papists call transubstantiationem, and obscures the proper custom of the sacrament. Since in the diocese of Milan, from the time of St. Ambrose until this day, neither the Canon, nor the Elevation, nor the Dominus vobiscum is used or kept in the Mass. 

(Here 6 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 35, B 6.) 


14) Where the elevation of the sacrament comes from and why it should be omitted. 


Doctor M. Luther was asked in 1542 by his table companions: Where does the elevation (that one lifts up the host and the chalice in the papist mass) come from? To this he answered and said, It is taken from the Old Testament: for they keep two words, one called Trumah, the other Tnuphah. 1) Now Trumah was when they took a sacrifice in a basket, or whatever it was in, and lifted it over themselves, as we lift up the host, and showed it to our Lord GOD to see it, after which they took it and burned it, or ate it. Tnuphah was the sacrifice when they did not lift it over themselves; but pointed and showed it to the four ends of the world, just as the papists in the mass made the crosses and other umbrellas to the four places of the world; for hence they took the same manner and ceremonies. 

And when D. Luther began to make the same crosses, with a strange movement [gesticulatione] 1) of the fingers, and could not meet the old custom, then he said: Marge, God's Mother, how we were troubled with the mass, and especially with the crosses. Mr. Friedrich Mecum often told me that he had not been able to make them all his life. Ah, we were poor people, and yet it was nothing but idolatry, we were real idolaters. They made some people so anxious with the words of institution, especially those who were pious.

They were so serious that they trembled completely when they said the words: Hoc est corpus meum: "This is my body," because they had to be spoken without offense. Whoever stammered or left a word out had committed a great sin. For this he had to read the words without all foreign thoughts, and so that he alone heard it and those around did not. | have also been such a devout monk for fifteen years; God forgive me. 

Then one of the table companions said, "Doctor, are there any other reasons why elevation should be discontinued than adoration, that is, the worship of the Lord's Supper? M. Luther answered: "I do not know of any other. Then he said, "Doctor, in places where the gospel has not been preached for so long, may one be patient and not discard the elevation so soon, especially where the people have not yet been confirmed? Then the doctor said: "We do not care about that, let it be taken away or not, we do not ask anything about it, if only the abuse is not there, the worship. Some churches have seen that we have dropped the elevation, so they do it after us; we are well satisfied with that. 


15. those who have not gone to the sacrament for a long time. 


One spoke to D. M. Luthern: Doctor, what should | do, how should | behave, if | find people in my church who have not gone to the sacrament in twenty years and a long time? Then M. Luther said: Let them go to the devil, and when they die, put them on the shingle. 2) 

He was further asked, "Should they be forced to take the sacrament? No, he said, because that is papist: tell them; if they want to do it, good; if not, let them go. But | am surprised that people abstain from the Sacrament and take it so rarely and unwillingly. Perhaps they are afraid of confession to the ears; but they really must not: he who feels his sin rightly, and who takes it seriously and loves the word of God with all his heart.

He will come and be glad that his conscience will be comforted and his weak faith strengthened. 


16. of the sacrament of the altar cause. (Cordatus No. 1718.) 

The causa efficiens of the sacrament is the word of God or the institution of Christ, the materia is bread and wine, the form is the body and blood of Christ, the finis is that we receive our faith, so that we do not doubt that Christ has passed away for us and that our sins are forgiven. And from this we obtain this benefit, or rather he himself offers it to us, that he wants to be our Savior, not our judge; our Redeemer, not our accuser; our Deliverer, not our avenger, and that we, who are guilty of death and condemnation, are justified and saved by the blood of Christ. 


17. of the words in the Lord's Supper. 


It was asked about the word "given for you" in the Lord's supper 2c..: Whether it is to be understood of the present kingdom, when the sacrament is administered, or when it is given and offered up for us on the cross? Then said D. M. Luther said, "It pleases me best that it be understood from the present kingdom and distribution, although it can also be understood from that which took place on the cross. And do not prevent Christ from saying, "This is given for you," when he should have said, "This will be given for you," for Christ is called hodie et heri, today and yesterday. It is | who do it, he says. Therefore it pleases me that the little word datur, given, should be understood to indicate the custom of the work. 


18) Whether to pay homage to the sacrament? 


One of them asked: "Should we pay homage to the sacrament of the altar? Then said D. M. Luther: "When | take the sacrament at the altar, | bend my knees in reverence, but in bed | take it lying down. 


Cap. 19. of the sacrament of the altar. § 15-20.

19 The Pope's conduct with the Sacrament. 


The pope does not deny the sacrament, but has robbed and stolen one form or part of it from the laity, and has not taught the proper use of the sacrament. The pope does not reject the Bible, but persecutes and kills righteous, pious, faithful teachers and people; just as the Jews persecuted and killed the prophets who interpreted the Scriptures correctly. As far as substance and essence are concerned, the pope lets the sacraments and the Bible remain; only he wants to force us to use them as he wants and prescribes. 

We teach the right custom of baptism and the sacrament of the altar: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved" 2c., Marc. 16, 16. But the Pope adds: He who believes and does good works will be saved. The priest does nothing else, but that he converts everything that God has ordered and commanded. |," he says, "will put on a low garment and use it for a crown, and my pants for a bodice. Thus he denies not the work in himself, but the custom; therefore all my disputing, writing and doing is against the abuse of the pope. 


20. the pabst's stand. 


Against this a Bohemian fought, 1) who wanted to reject the pope. Then said D. M. Luther said: "It is written: "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. Since one does not misuse God's name, it would be unavoidable to forbid that one uses it uselessly. We can use the name of God well and badly, otherwise no one could find or do wrong. Therefore it follows that he who takes God's name in vain has the right name of God; he who takes a false name in vain does not sin, but he who takes the right name of God in vain complains about it. Because of the abuse the name does not become false, which the Waldensians in Bohemia do not believe, nor can they believe it. 


1) Dr. Henning. 


576 Cap. 19 Of the sacrament of the altar. § 20-22. 577 


So a rebel who sits down against the authorities and makes a noise sins, but he does no harm to the authorities but to himself, for the authorities will and must remain. Thus Judas is a mischievous man, and yet he baptizes, preaches, and heals the sick: when he says to a lame man, "Arise and walk," it is so; for he does this in the name of Jesus Christ, even though he does not believe in Christ; indeed, he thinks nothing of him. 

Therefore the ministry is not that of Judah the betrayer, nor of the pope, nor of the bishops, but the ministry of preaching is commanded and entrusted to them by Christ. Thus God pours wine, oil, through a stinking reed or vessel, and yet nothing is taken away from the wine as far as its substance and essence are concerned; although the taste is somewhat changed, so that it tastes and smells like the unclean vessel. Item: A magistrate and commander gives grain or a donation by order of the prince; although he is a mischievous man, | accept the gift he gives me out of the grace and benevolence of the prince: what is he to me who gives it and distributes it? | look to the prince. 

If Thomas Aquinas, a preacher-monk, had called God's word Opus operatum, he would have come through. Then Heineck said: 1) Doctor, a sorceress has God's word and needs it, should one believe her, like the pope? To this D. Mart. Luther and said: She is not in the preaching office, nor does she have a command from God, as the pope and the bishops have; but is only a private and individual person. The offices are various and different, but it is God who sits there and condemns and works all in all. 

Thomas Aquinas also says that there should be a secret power in the baptismal water. Therefore, the disputation arose that a character, that is, an indelible mark should be imprinted on the baptized person, as one burns a mark on the forehead or face. But Scotus denies this, 


1) The same Boehme, Dr. Henning. Henning he is called Cap. 8, § 1 and Cap. 43, Z144; Heneck Cap. 13, § 35; Hennike Cap. 9, § 63: Hennick Cap. 13, § 67; Dominus Heinneck Bindseil II, 23, and Cap. 37, § 3. 


He said, "Let it be because of God's covenant; when the priest baptizes, God is present with his covenant. And he was right in saying that he was a very fine man. 


21. of the sacraments of the old testament. 


The sacraments of the Old Testament and Law did not make righteous by their power and their own effect, but were only mere signs, meanings and indications before the people. But baptism is a water involved and connected with God's Word, in which grace is promised; for the sacraments of the New Testament are not mere signs, as those of the Old Testament were, but also work forgiveness of sin, righteousness and blessedness in those who need them with right faith. As the words read: "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved" 2c, Marc. 16, 16. "This is my blood, shed for you for the forgiveness of sins", Matth. 26, 28. 

Summa, it was only because the Bible was not read in high schools: and those who read it at the same time thought that it had to be understood according to the sense and opinion of the See of Rome, as the Pope interpreted it and wanted it to be understood. It has been nothing but child's play. But | hope that many people have been blessed who have remained simple-mindedly with the bad text and have adhered to it alone; for the text of the Holy Bible alone holds the sting. Ambrose, Augustine and other fathers do not. 


22. auxiliary of the pope. 


So also the pope says: | have the Bible and the right text, and | also say, as you do. How shall one do to him? God alone must be the judge of which part is right, in which the Scriptures are presented most clearly and plainly, according to the content of the words, what they are actually and plainly called, and what they are put on paper by the Holy Spirit. Not to interpret, understand and twist according to reason and philosophy, but as God Himself has spoken them through the mouth of His prophets and apostles and godly teachers, as we have it, praise God, pure and unadulterated.

28 Sacrament. (Cordatus No. 1720.) 


Sacrament is an act of a man with divine promises, or a visible sign with [divine] promises. 


29. Christ's true body 2c. in the sacrament is also in many places. 


Just as a thousand days are only one day before God, so also one place before God is all places, and all places are only one place. Therefore it is no wonder that in the sacrament Christ's body is in many and various places at the same time and at once. 

In the sacrament is possible what is otherwise impossible in nature, as, dimensionum penetratio, that is, one body is in the other body, and yet each retains its size, and no one exceeds the other's size, similarly there is the length and width of the body. 


(30) Against those who do not believe that Christ's body and blood are in the Lord's Supper. 


Doctor Martin Luther once said: O Lord God, whoever cannot believe that Christ is in bread or ina grain of wheat, will believe much less in creation. This is a high article, that all creatures are created from nothing. And even less will he believe that God became man. Least of all that there are three persons and only one being. That leaves reason well satisfied. 

It is easy for me to believe that Christ's body is under the bread; but it is difficult that so many glorious bodies in heaven and earth should come from nothing. This | cannot understand, it is not possible for me. Much less can | understand that the Son of God was born of Mary the Virgin, and that the other two Persons of the Godhead did not take on flesh. Do they want to take offense at the article? If they do not want to learn the ABC, how can they learn the Donat? The article of creation is such a high thing that no man can understand it: so the holy scripture remains hidden to the wise and prudent, says St. Paul, 1 Cor. 1:20, 21. 


If they do not believe this, the consequence will soon follow. The word of God, even God Himself, sits at the right hand of the Father. And yet | live here in the word of God. "In Him we live, weave, and are", Apost. 17, 28. Where then will my life remain? 


31. that the act of the Lord's Supper should not be used as a joke or a joke. 


It was attributed to Doctor Martin Luther from Nuremberg that a priest, a Gauch, should have given communion to a woman in her area, and since he did not have a chalice, he would have taken a spoon and said: Take it and drink, it is the spoon of the New Testament. Doctor Martin Luther laughed a little at this; but he said, "This must be a knave. And if | were the lords of Nuremberg, | would give him the spoon; for it is a blasphemy; | would have him cast into the tower for a year, and say, This spoon belongs in such a spoon's food. 


32. from the little word "All drink from it”. (Contained in Cap. 45, § 84.) 


33. an argument against the papists. 


All those who do not keep the Sacrament as Christ instituted it, have no Sacrament. Now all papists do, therefore they have no sacrament. For they do not receive their Sacrament, but offer it; after that they pass only one form, contrary to Christ's institution and command. The major, the first saying, is true, because the sacrament is God's work and order, not a man's. 


34. of the same shape. 


The church can therefore be excused in one form: just as if someone desires baptism in true faith and dies beforehand, he is baptized in his faith and death instead of water, whereas otherwise others are always baptized to death. So also: He who desires both forms, and yet cannot have them, is as one who is caught ignorant, and has died with faith. 


582 Cap. 19 Of the sacrament of the altar. § 34-36. 583 


all both received shape. In this way God was able to preserve His own, even in another way, unknown to us. Because the right knowledge and faith remained with them, that it is Christ's order that the true body and blood be in the sacrament, they received it with faith, and no sin could harm them to condemnation, because they were deceived, and did it unknowingly, not knowingly; so that they are not condemned even if perhaps the devil only gave them bread, because faith in Christ's institution devours it all. But that faith remained with them, this song proves: "With his flesh and with his blood" 2c., also indicates that both forms were in use among the laity. But | will let it be, otherwise they, the papists, should also forbid this little hymn, even though it came from their church and was not made by Luther. 


35: The Consecration of the Sacrament. 


D. M. Luther was asked in 1541 whether it was in the preacher's power to consecrate the Lord's Supper, and how the bread could become Christ's body? whether such a great thing was in the preacher's power, because preachers were often bad boys? To this he replied, "Just as God ordained in creation that the sun should rise and shine daily, giving light and warmth to the creatures; so also the Lord Christ ordained and commanded that in his church his essential body and blood should be in the Lord's Supper, not only spiritual but also bodily, and yet incomprehensible. For thus says the Lord Christ, "Receive, eat; this is my body; this do in remembrance of me." Therefore in the church of the Lord Christ's body is in the Lord's Supper, when it is received according to Christ's order. And one should not look to the priest who administers it, but only to the word of the Lord Christ, who has promised this to his Christianity. Just as the Holy Spirit is also in the Christian church, that is, with the saints or believers. 

In sum, one should admonish the astute disputatores that they should therefore be very careful about their 


Rationes and Argument" do not insist, build and trust; for God is wont to make fools of worldly men, as happened to Ahitophel, Absalon's councilor. And the holy scripture says that what is high and excellent in the eyes of the world is an abomination in the eyes of God. So this worldly wisdom of the Sacramentans can also be very deceived and displeasing to our Lord God. For what other proof and reason do these disputators have for themselves, but vain human thoughts and rational causes, spun and taken from reason, which are not comforting to a conscience, and do not strengthen or satisfy a conscience? Yea, let them be concerned about that which is most needful in the Scriptures, namely, faith, judgment, and mercy, as Christ commands, more than with these things and disputations. What do such fellows do more wrong than to leave the doctrine of justification (how to become pious, righteous and blessed before God, and of love), and to quarrel about sacraments, and to be mosquito swallowers and camel devourers? 

They should be reminded of this, either by those who doubt the sacraments or by those who stubbornly defend the new doctrine. For it is of no use to dispute sharply with them about the matter, since seldom can one be sufficiently instructed and satisfied by disputing, since one comes together once or twice. It takes a good long time to tear such erroneous opinions and delusions out of the heart: this requires fine friendly conversations and decent modest people. 

But | think it best to teach the Catechismum, the Ten Commandments, the faith and the Lord's Prayer in the pulpit. For it is certain that even those who think they are mightily learned in the Gospel and are masters of the craft do not yet understand. 


You fall however you want, wherever you want, that's how you fall. 


Some err and fall too much on the left side, that they give too much to the sacraments, namely, that they do justice ex opere operato, when the work is done and one uses them. 


584 


Cap. 19, Of the Sacrament of the Altar. § 36-40. 


585 





with the deed, even without faith; as in the papacy. The sacramentarians err and fall too far to the right hand, namely, in that they break off everything from the sacraments, considering them to be mere signs of life. Thus it goes: if one falls out of the ship in the back or in the front, one lies in the water. 


37 The Taking of the Sacrament for Itself. 


One of them asked M. Luther: "If someone should die and could not have the whole sacrament from the papists, would he like to give him the sacrament himself? No, he said, because there should always be at least two persons: one who gives it, the other who takes it. Just as a woman may baptize a child in distress, but the child does not baptize itself. If one cannot have it, it is enough in faith, according to the saying of Christ, "Thy faith hath saved thee" 2c. But if he can have it, let him not despise it. 

St. Ambrose says the like in one place, that he had a catechumen, so he reported in the Christian faith, and the. Catechismum taught and converted. The latter, when he set out, wanted to go to Ambrosio and be baptized by him, so he died on the way, unbaptized. This made Ambrosio think hard that he said: Doleo ventrem meum: my belly is hurting me (misused of the words in the prophet); he wanted to show his heartache and sorrow for the unbaptized boy with such words. Finally, after having argued with him for a long time, he concludes that he was saved even without baptism, through his faith: because he considered baptism to be right and did not despise it, he would also have been baptized in faith if it could have happened to him. | have had many questions, especially from the land of Meissen, where Duke G[eorg] tyrannized. But it is wrong that someone wanted to give him the sacrament himself. 


38 Another question, addressed to D. M. Luther Anno 1542. 


Whether one may take the sacrament from a minister who publicly holds and teaches that the true body and blood of Christ are not 


in the sacrament, but that Christ is there spiritually, as he is in all places with his grace? Some admit it and let it go, because one should not consider the person or the dignity, worthiness or unworthiness, which the sacrament bestows. But M. Luther said straightforwardly no to this; for there ceases not the worthiness of the person, but the thing itself, res ipsa, there is no sacrament. Item, if he does not keep the sacrament right, they must not do against Christ, who shed his blood for them. 


(Here 12 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 19, § 30.) 


Faith in the Sacrament. 


(Here 2 paragraphs are omitted because contained in Cap. 19, § 30.)

They have not had the temptations and thoughts about the Sacrament that | have had. That is why | have often said before this racket that Carlstadt started: | do not know of any challenge to the faith on the part of the rotten, except the two, of Anabaptists and Sacramentarians. 


40. Spiritual things also have their time. 


One said he still doubted the baptism. Thereupon D. M. Luther said in a friendly and humble manner: "You have not been on the level when you first came here, now that you are up. Continue to wait, let our Lord God take his time; let the trees blossom before they bear fruit. Who have | been? | have worshipped the saints who have never been born. It is not yet time, or | would say it; but wait, and it shall be seen what the outward oral word is and can be.

Blaurerus taught, as | am reported, that bread and wine are objecta sensuum (that is, that which the senses perceive); but the body and blood of Christ are objecta fidei (that which faith grasps); so make them first duo objecta. Well, what is that?

It would not be good for us to know pugnam Angelorum pro nobis, for we would have to despair; for the devil's thoughts are no different than that he intends to destroy us completely, for he is hostile to the Lord Christ and his members.

good friend of D. M. Luther, and the doctor's report from it. 


The first: Whether one may take the reverend sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord Christ in Bohemia from the Hussites or Picards 3) with a clear conscience? because the Hussites, according to Christ's command, do not speak the words about the bread and wine: "This is my body, this is my blood" 2c. publicly, as here in Wittenberg, but secretly, but do so in church before the people. The Picures, however, whether they do it according to Christ's command, | do not know, but they do not do it publicly in church, like the Hussites, but secretly in the houses where they come together. Therefore, since the sacraments should and must be performed and used publicly, according to Christ's command, please report to me favorably, from which (Hussites or Picards) would it be safer to receive such? 


Answer by D. Martin Luther. 


Because one does not know what these or those do, it is better to abstain from the sacrament: especially because the Hussites hold to the pope and no longer follow the priest, their communion in the sacrament is to be avoided, lest one become partaker of their nature as the pope. And because they celebrate private masses and speak the words secretly, no one can be sure that they are spoken; for all men are liars, and it is also contrary to the institution of Christ to celebrate private masses and speak the words secretly. Since this is done knowingly, we should not approve what we have done before, since we did not know if it was sinful; it belongs to the forgiveness of sins.

and grace of God belong to all men: therefore, if the} The cries of the Sacramentarians that we Lutherans forget all 


children are to be blessed, they must receive the reverend Sacrament as well as the aged? 


Answer by D. Martin Luther. 


It is wrong that they consider it necessary for salvation to give the sacrament to children, even if it is not a sin; for St. Cyprian also did this; since the saying John 6:53, which they add: "He who does not eat" 2c., does not belong to the sacrament, but to faith. Therefore, it is unnecessary to give to the little children, but they are not condemned because of it. 


47. of the sacrament. 


If one did not truly know and be certain that the sacrament is a great and mighty thing in the Christian church, one could or should recognize it by the fact that the devil challenges the sacrament so much and has challenged it through the sacrament abusers, the fanatics, the Minsterians and many other cults and sects. For the devil challenges the great pieces of Christian doctrine the most, and follows the common saying: Where our Lord God builds a church, the devil builds a chapel next to it. 


(48) Whether the sacrament should be given to one who lies. 


When the time is right, and | admonish a rich man in confession to give something to the poor for God's sake, and he says he does not have it, shall | also give the sacrament to such a liar? one asked. Then said D. M. Luther said, "If he denies it, what more can be done? If he persists in his denial, do as Christ did, who also gave the sacrament to Judah the traitor. 

One of them said about the example of Anania, Apost. 5, whom St. Peter, because he lied, killed with one word. Answered D. M. Luther: That was something special; and | believe that Peter did it not out of his spirit for himself, but out of revelation. For God wanted to confirm the first church with miracles and miraculous signs. 


love toward them. 


Doct. Luther said Anno 1542 about tables: The Sacramentirer have well plagued us with the Charitate in their books and writings, and spoken: You of Wittenberg have no Charitatem. When one asks them, what is charitas, they say, ut consentiamus in Doctrina, et omittamus rixas illas de Religione. Then one must answer them and say: Yes, listen, there are two tables in the Ten Commandments, Prima et Secunda; now Charitas belongs in secundam Tabulam, there it goes over all works: but in prima Tabula it says: Time Deum, audi Verbum ejus; there they ask nothing. Now Christ says: Qui Matrem et Patrem plus diligit quam me, non est me dignus. You shall have Charitatem erga Parentes, erga Liberos, Conjugem et Vicinum. In the other tablet it says: Ama, ama, sis pius in Patrem, Matrem et proximum; but in the first it says: Si quis diligit plus Patrem et Matrem quam me. Where the ME comes, Charitas ceases, and there | will gladly be called pertinax, superbus, capitosus and sine Charitate, and whatever else they want to call us; only that | am not particeps to their false teaching, because my dear God protects me from that. 


50. abuse of the sacraments. (Contained in Cap. 37, § 75.) 


The priests are ordered to do this. 


The ministers of the church are not ordained to make or bring the sacrament, but to administer and give it in the church. Just as they are not to bring or administer baptism or the word, but to administer or preach it. 

The water and word together is baptism. From where? Does the servant do it? No, but that it is Christ's order. So, under the bread and wine is the body of Christ, for Christ has so ordered it. 

3) They, the papist priests, like fools, presume to have power and authority to consecrate and to make the Sacrament, which neither the angels in heaven, nor Mary, nor the whole Church of the Holy Spirit have.

The papacy is intolerable, because the pope not only presumes to be the head of the whole church (which could be granted to him after all), but beyond that he has also presumed to have power over God's word, which he has not preached, nor will he ever preach, that is not to be suffered.

doctrine if it were approved by the pope. This has been openly confessed by H[archduke 1) G[eorg], therefore he will go to his God, to whom he has given glory. 

Those who praise the prestige of the church over the word are like those who say: | would like to love the son, but | must first beat the mother to death; for they ascribe more to the generated church than to the begetting word. But thank God that we are not heretics, but only schismatics, and that through their fault.

2. what the church is. (Cordatus No. 1415.) 


The church is an assembly of the people who are 1) well versed in things not before their eyes. The wicked see nothing but defects [peccata] in it, but they do not find crimes [in it]. 


3. God must preserve His Church Himself. 


We say to our Lord GOD: If he wants his church, let him keep it, for we cannot keep it: and if we could, we should become the proudest asses under heaven. That is, | say it and do it. For God alone speaks, does nothing according to the opinion of the wicked, as they think it good and right. 


4. the poor bad shape of the church annoys the world's worshippers. 2) (Lauterbach, Jan. 16, 1538, p. 12.) 


Therefore, Jerome S[churf] and the sages are offended by the image of the church, which is subject to perverts and sects, because he believes that the church is the pure, holy, undefiled dove of God. True, the church has such a reputation before God, but before the world it is similar to its bridegroom Christ, Is. 53, chopped up, scratched, scorched, crucified, ridiculed. 3) 


5. equality of the right and wrong church. (Lauterbach, Jan. 16, 1538, p. 13.) 


The figure of the church and of Christ is the sheep, the figure of the hypocrites the snake, the viper, the adder; we learn this from the very bitter hatred of religion, which is far stronger than all human and brotherly hatred, as we have learned from Oecolampad, Zwingli and Bucer. Cochlaus wrote to me very calmly at the beginning and exhorted me to the gospel, later he became a viper.

6. comparison of the church among the Gentiles and Jews. (Lauterbach, April 30, 1538, p. 74.) 


When he was asked whether the church of the Gentiles or that of the Jews had a greater reputation according to what is before his eyes, he answered: "The church of the Gentiles is nothing compared to that of the Jews. For what, Christ [alone] excepted, is equal in the whole New Testament to the first three chapters of Genesis, of the creation? It is truly a great majesty of creation; as we sing: Great Creator of the stars, Eternal Light of the faithful [Conditor alme siderum, Aeterna lux credentium] 2c. Behold the deliverance from Egypt, the Red Sea, the pillar of cloud, the manna. But all this became small with the Jews. Behold the glory of baptism, which was glorious in the beginning! Are we not so accustomed to baptism that we miss the glorious act of baptism and run after the smallest spectacle, a barrel-stealer 4)? Consider if someone admires the reading of the Psalter as much as the style of “erence or Cicero? In short: By frequency everything becomes small. Thus a papist exclaimed in the beginning of the Gospel: Eh, how the world is transformed! Now one wants to preach the ten commandments. Who has ever heard it before? 


7. the church should be in the midst of the world among the people. 5) (Lauterbach, Aug. 31, 1538, p. 126.) 


That is why God placed His Church in the midst of the world, in the most diverse businesses and professions, so that Christians would not become monks, but would live in common society and our works and practices of faith would be known among men. For human society, as Aristotle says, is not an end in itself, but a means, its ultimate end being to instruct one another about GOD. Therefore, Aristotle says: Not a physician and a physician, an agriculturist and an agriculturist 2c. form a commonwealth. There are three estates: the ar-

the healing, the warring and the ruling; of these the state consists. Therefore Plato says: As cattle are not governed by cattle, and goats by goats, so men are not governed by men, but by heroes. 


8. definition of the right essential church of God. 


Doctor M. Luther pointed out the correct definition of the true, essential, Christian Church, against the Papists' boast, namely, as it is written in the third part of our Christian faith, where we say: A holy catholic, that is, general church, acommunion of saints. It does not say Roman. This is a good learned dialecticus, who can take from what precedes, ex antecedenti, and conclude the consequent, as certainly follows from it; so that the art of dialectica does not stand in rules alone, but most of all in works and examples; as U. Philippus is, who acts both, word and thing, not like Aristotle: Omne A est B, omne B est C, ergo etc.. 


9. difference of the true and false church. 


The true church is thus distinguished from the false church, namely: The true church teaches that sins are forgiven out of pure grace and mercy of God, free of charge, for the sake of Christ, without our merit and works, to those who recognize and confess their sin from the heart and firmly believe in Christ with the heart. But the false church ascribes all this to our merit and works, and calls it doubting. 

That is why we are burdened in the church, with the church, asking for the church, said D. M. Luther. For there are three things that preserve the church, and actually belong to the church: First, to teach faithfully; second, to pray diligently; and third, to suffer earnestly. 


19. new reformation of the church, and how to reform the church. (Lauterbach, 4. Der. 1538, p. 186, and 12. Der. 1538, p. 191.) On December 4, D. M. Luthern received from Phil. Melanchthon a written refor 


Cap. 20: Of the Christian church. § 7-11. 


599 


The Pope had received a copy of the Papists' Declaration under Duke George, which they had written themselves, since they feared Duke George's harsh and strict reformation. Having recently read it, he said: "These people want to reform the church and govern it according to their thoughts and human wisdom, since such things are much too high for human suggestions and counsels. If our Lord God wanted to reform His Church, it was done in a divine, not human, way, as in the time of Joshua the judge, Samuel the apostle, and in our time. 

I can see that the papists are afraid. They are more afraid of H[Archduke] George than of Luther: they have asked H[Archduke] George to be their godfather, and now they want to get rid of him. . For if his Reformation should have its way, the pope would have to leave his splendor, and the bishop of Mainz would have to ride only with four horses, and so on. 

Then they talked about the reformation of the papists under Duke George, and Luther said: "| would like to see what kind of church they want to establish, whether after the example of the first church at the time of the apostles or the martyrs: they will have to read all the fathers. Or if they want to follow the church of the time of the heretics, they will also have to read a lot, otherwise they will become the most unfortunate imitators. Our church is, by God's grace, closest to the apostolic church, because we have the pure doctrine, the catechism, the sacraments, the right custom of the world and domestic regiment. If the Word of God remains pure and in force, which alone makes the Church, all is well. The papists, however, who want to establish the church according to their canons and decrees, make a unity of discordant things, and will draw water with a sieve, however they trust in the wisdom of reason. 


Where and which is the right church. 


In 39, Jan. 16, there was talk about how the papists boasted about the name and authority of the church. M. Luther: "Where God's Word is pure and taught, there is also the church, for the church is sustained by the Holy Spirit, not by ordained authority. 


600 


succession and inheritance. For it does not follow and conclude: Peter was a pious, Christian bishop at Rome, and at that time a Christian congregation, therefore the popes and the Roman church are also Christian. Otherwise, if this were to be concluded and applied, one would have to say: Caiphas, Annas, the Sadducees would also have been a Christian church, because they boasted that they came from Aaron. 

On 18 Jan. of the same 39th year, the Abbot of Naumburg at St. Georgen, 1) a good singer and cheerful man, dined at night with D. M. Luther and said much about the united argument of the papists, about the church; then D. M. Luther spoke. M. Luther said: "One should not be surprised that there was discord and disunity among the Gentiles, since the same church was also a people gathered by God; for this is what happens when one lets go of God's word and looks at persons and external things. 

It is true that it is said that the church cannot err; but of this is the dispute, which is the church. Duke George has always hoped that our church would fall; but because he now sees that it is growing and increasing every day, and his parishes are becoming desolate, the leaf would almost fall from his eyes. The bishops, however, are blind, do not take care of the church, and would rather that all parishes be devastated and abandoned than that the gospel be taught righteously and purely. The princes have to deal with other things, do not despise God as much as the bishops. Many of them are presumptuous and make themselves believe that they know and understand the gospel very well, that they are masters rather than disciples. That is why St. Paul speaks to the Corinthians, out of great compassion and pity, thus: If God wanted you to rule, oh how | would like to grant it to you 2c. It is truly a bitter jronia and a fierce sting against the despisers and presumptuous, satiable spirits. 


The church sheds its blood. (Cordatus No. 985.) It is impossible for the church to grow, or even be sustained, without blood;

601 


because the devil, their adversary, is a liar against the truth and a murderer against those who believe the truth. It grieves me that | should carry my blood to the grave, especially since many monks who have been preachers have died shedding their blood. 


13. the state of the christian church. 


The Christian church will be no different than a lamb that the wolf has caught by the wool and wants to eat. Our nobility, burghers and peasants also do not listen, do not mean differently, when we preach the gospel and scold the monks with their works, we preach good days and allow them to do what they want. 

Alas, it will go badly with them, they sin too much and do not listen to what we say; if we cast out one devil, seven will take their place. If we expelled all the monks, we would get seven times worse than the present ones. 

But | thought it would be more beneficial for a country to let up on the chasing and destroying, and | allowed everyone to move out and stay whoever wanted to. | hope they will soon devastate themselves. But the lords and the nobility are looking for their own, so they will get it like the dog gets the grass. Everyone wants to become rich from the beggars of the monasteries; but they take care that their wealth does not become beggars! 


14, the shape of the church. 


Worldly men see that the church is shapeless and despised, poor and miserable; but other ungodly men are brought forth and exalted, judging it by reason, without God's word; so they go. Hence they despise the whole religion, and say that the article of the resurrection of the dead was only invented to frighten the mob, and to put and keep them in fear. The peasants seldom come to despise God and religion, they just do not think about it otherwise; but the wise and prudent take care of it, think about it, measure it and judge it according to reason. So 


602 Cap. 20: Of the Christian church. § 14-20. 603 


has Erasmus Rotterodam, and others, the most learned, understanding and wise people, the Epicurer in the bosom. 

But we know by the grace of God that the holy Scriptures are confirmed and corroborated by miraculous signs, which no other teaching is able to do, except to raise the dead and cast out devils 2c. That is why our Lord God warns us so often to stay with the Holy Scriptures and His Word. 

(Here a section of 45 lines is omitted because contained in 

Cap. 1, § 89.) 


There are many troubled consciences in the Christian church. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 119, para. 2 u. 3.) 


16. the church fear. 


The church's mourning and lying in childbearing will last for a long time, but her age and time will come when she will be redeemed and have a happy countenance. Joh. 16, 20. 21. 


17. the shape of the church. 


The shape and appearance of the church is ugly, sad and distressed, but in truth it triumphs and wins with Christ. St. Paul says in Eph. 2, 6: "He has seated us together with Christ in the heavenly realm. Just as a bride is a dominatrix and wife of her husband's goods, so a believer is lord of all his bridegroom's goods, for he is raised with Christ and seated in the heavenly realm. Therefore, it is not a hope when we defy the devil for God's goods and gifts, which Christ has acquired for us and he, the devil, has lost. God sees nothing evil in His church and congregation, for He only looks at Christ, His dear Son, whom He loves so much that He sees nothing evil in His bride before such love, for He "has cleansed her through the bath of water in the Word," Eph. 5:26. 

Item: In the form of the church nothing less is seen than that it is said of her that she is the Lord Christ: therefore one must open the eyes of the heart and lift them above oneself, and not look according to the outward appearance and according to our mind and 


We do not judge in our own minds, for we feel sin and the devil's terror; but we are to judge according to God's word and promise. 


18. the world and church reputation. 


The world's appearance and reputation is like a paradise, but the reputation of the true Christian and God's church is very ugly, shameful and annoying in the eyes of the world; yet it is precious, high and dear in the eyes of God. Aaron the high priest, in his robes and adornments, walked gloriously in the temple, smelling well; but Christ walked badly and despised. Therefore we are not to be deceived nor disputing what and how the world thinks and judges of the church. Why do | ask that the usurers, nobles, peasants, burghers, miserly people, and scoundrels despise me and consider me filthy? | will do the same in his time, at the last day, and will despise them again. Therefore, we should not let ourselves be deceived, nor should we worry about what the world thinks of us with its smarties. Virtus est placuisse bonis: Honor and virtue is to please the pious. 


10. why the church on earth is in misery. 


First, that we may be reminded and admonished that we are exiled and cast out from paradise because of Adam's fall. Secondly, that we remember the misery of the Son of God, who became man for our sake, took our flesh and blood, yet without all sin, walked on this miserable valley of tears, suffered for us, died, and rose again from death, and thus brought us back to our fatherland, from which we were driven. Third, that such misery may teach us and remind us that our citizenship is not in this world, but that we are only pilgrims here on earth, and that another life, namely eternal life, is still left to us. 


20. testimony of the faith of the church. (Cordatus No. 29.) 


That there is a church is an article of faith that can be grasped with faith. 


604 


not with eyes. Moreover, God hides them in a miraculous way, sometimes through sins, sometimes through disputes and errors, sometimes through weakness, all kinds of impulses, the death of the pious and the multitude of the wicked 2c. He hides them so much that he also needed the disunity of the apostles for this, as can be seen in the dispute of Paul against Peter, also in the disunity of Marcus, Barnabas and Paul. And one must believe that all of Asia, a very famous country in many respects, fell away from Paul for no other reason than that the church was hidden, which was certainly in Asia, but in very few who were known to God [alone]. 


21. fame of the church among all hypocrites, (Lauterbach, Dec. 5, 1538, p. 187.) 

The name and fame of the church is their [the hypocrites'] strongest argument. In Acts (6, 13.) they cry out against Stephen: "He has spoken against the people, against the holy place and the law." The title was used by Cain, Ishmael, Saul, the Turk and the Jews, but Moses resolves it in Deut. 32, (v. 21.): "They have provoked me against that which is not God; with their idolatry they have provoked me to anger. And | will provoke them again" 2c. Piece by piece you can leave me, so | can leave you again. For GOD and the people, Word and Church are two things that belong together [correlativa] So the papists are called bishops, but they are not. We are not called bishops and yet we are, according to Paul's explanation, Titus 1 and 1 Timothy 5. The pomp of the papists would still be bearable, but their idolatry is the most godless. 


The fruit in the womb is an image and likeness of the church. 


Just as the child in the womb is surrounded and wrapped with a thin skin, which the Greeks call the chorion, we Germans call it the afterbirth, and desires no more nourishment than its cotyledons, as it is called, from which the fruit has its sustenance, bring. The afterbirth also does not break, unless the fruit is early and ripe and comes into the world to light. 


Cap. 20: Of the Christian church. § 20-23. 


605 


is brought. Thus the church is also locked into the Word and bound to it, and seeks no other teaching of the will of God than that which is revealed and indicated in the same Word, with which it is satisfied, on which it also remains and rests through faith. Until such time as in that life she sees God's light and face present, and hears God himself preach of the secret and now hidden things, which we have here in faith, but there in sight. 

But that some are so careless and glorious that they break the afterburden by untimely movement (like the Anabaptists and other enthusiasts and red spirits who despise the preaching ministry and wait for new inspiration and movement from heaven), these must become untimely fruit and dead children, as abortus et immaturae massae. Therefore, the church should learn, when considering this likeness and image, that it is bound by the word given to it by God, from which it should not depart one finger or one bit. 


Another likeness and image of the church. 


Amaranthus grows in the month of August, and is more of a stem than a flower; it likes to be broken off, and grows finely, happily and merrily. And when all the flowers are gone, and this is sprinkled with water and made moist, then it becomes pretty again and equally green, so that one can make wreaths from it in winter. It is called amaranthus because it does not wither or wither. 

| do not know if anything can be more like the church than Amaranthus, this flower, which we call Tausendschon. For even though the church has chosen her garment in the blood of the lamb, as it is written in the first book of Moses and in the Revelation of John, and is dyed with red, she is more beautiful than any state or assembly on earth. And she alone does the Son of God love as his dear bride, in whom alone he has his delight and joy: to her alone does his heart cling, rejecting and disgusting all others who despise or falsify the gospel. Moreover, the church also likes to be broken off and plucked up, that is, it is willingly and gladly obedient to God in the cross, is 


606 


It is patient in this, and grows again with joy, and increases; that is, it receives the greatest benefit and fruit from it, namely, that it learns to know God rightly, to call upon Him, to confess the doctrine freely, and brings forth many beautiful, glorious virtues. Finally, the body and the trunk remain whole and cannot be cut off, even though some of the members rage and rage and are torn off. For just as the amaranthus, the thousand-flower, does not wither or die, so the church can never be destroyed or cut off. But what is more wonderful than amaranthus? If it is sprinkled with water and laid in it, it becomes green and fresh again, as if raised from the dead. 

So we shall have no doubt that the church, raised from the graves by God, will come forth alive again, and praise, extol and glorify the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, together with the Holy Spirit, forever. For though other empires, kingdoms, principalities, and dominions have their changes, and soon, like little flowers, wither and fall away, yet this kingdom, which is so high and deeply rooted, cannot be destroyed nor laid waste by any power or force, but abides forever. 


24. from the oil tree. 

An oil tree can stand, last and bear fruit for two hundred years, and is a beautiful image of the church. For oil means the sweetness and kindness of the gospel; wine, the teaching of the law. There is sucha natural unity and relationship between the vine and the oil tree that when the vine is grafted and planted on an oil tree, it bears both grapes and oil. So the church, planted in the people, sounds and teaches the gospel, and needs both teachings, and brings forth fruit from both. 


25. useless fame of the pope from the Roman church. | am surprised, said D. M. Luther, that the pope praises the Roman church as the most noble, since the one in Jerusalem is the mother, where the doctrine is first revealed and taught. 


Cap. 20: Of the Christian church. § 23-26. 


607 


The church of Antioch was founded by Christ, the Son of God, Himself and His apostles. After that is the church at Antioch, from which the Christians get their name. Third, is the church at Alexandria. And fourth, the Roman, though before it were Galatians, Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians 2c. Churches. 

Is it such a great thing that St. Peter was in Rome? Since Christ our Savior was in Jerusalem, since all the articles of our Christian faith were made, since St. James was ordained and became bishop, and since the pillars of the church had their seat. 

It is [the Roman church] the last wrath of God, which boasts and boasts with vanity, and burdens and torments many consciences with lies. 


26. from the saying Augustin: Evangelio non crederem etc.. 


This saying of St. Augustine, when he writes: | did not believe the gospel, the church confirmed it before by her authority 1) 2c., (said D. M. Luther) is never written of the opinion, how the papists dream and invent. For Augustine never intended to write that one should believe his and other writings more than the Gospel; but wants that one should believe only the Holy Scriptures and God's Word, and not judge them according to our understanding and reason, as about the doctrines of men; as he testifies in another place with these words, in Prologo lib. 3. de Trinitate: "Thou shalt not believe my writings to please thee, but the holy Scriptures: what thou findest in them, believe without delay, and without all doubt, though thou didst not believe it before. But in my writings, what you do not believe to be certain, unless you understand it to be certain, do not believe it to be firm." 

And in the 8th epistle to St. Jerome: | have learned to give this fear and honor to the holy Scriptures, so that | may not believe that anything in them is false. Or, if | find anything in it that might be contrary to the truth, | should think nothing else, but that the book is false, and that it is not true. 


1) Cf. Cap. 57, § 11, 4th paragraph.

wrongly written; or that the interpreter has not attained the opinion of what is said; or do not doubt that he has not understood it. But if | read the others in this way, be they as holy or as learned as they please, | do not think that it is true because they have believed it to be so; but that they prove it to me with holy scripture or proven causes that it is true 2c. And again: So am | to

On the 27th of April he said much about the church, which boasts the name church, but this name would be less, than the true church. For with the churches the dear prophets fought, as Isaiah soon

in the election and calling of God, which is strong in its weakness. 


The Sophists' Deception, Fallaciae Sophistarum. (Lauterbach, April 19, 1538, p. 65.) On April 19, one mentioned the intrigues of the

The papists stand on it: the Church cannot err: we are the Church; ergo, therefore we do not err. To the erstell. Saying, majorem, | answer D. M. Luther: The church cannot err, is true, yes, namely, in doctrine, but in works and deeds she may well err, and often errs, therefore she asks: Forgive us our trespasses or sins.

Therefore, if one argues and says: what the church teaches is right and pure, that is true; then we admit it. But if one says: What the church does is right, we do not admit it, but say no to it. Therefore one should always look at the teaching, the teaching does it. 


28. the difference between Christ's kingdom and the world's kingdom. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 166.) 


29 The Church's Annoyance. (Contained in Cap. 20, § 4.) 





This is the kind of false conclusion: Every kingdom that suffers in temporal things is a temporal one; the church of Christ suffers in temporal things; therefore, the church of Christ and the kingdom of Christ are temporal. | answered, No, dear brother, the kingdom of Christ does not suffer, but our body is smitten by its sins, as Paul says in the Acts of the Apostles (14:22.): that "through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of GOD." It is not said that the kingdom of God suffers externally. Of this kind is also this fallacy: God is love; God justifies; therefore, love justifies. Such fallacies can deceive even an astute and well- trained person. Therefore, one should not answer soon, but take time to think, or speak: | do not know how to answer. For when Diogenes was thus pointedly said: What | am, that thou art not; | ama man; therefore thou art not a man: then he answered, Lift up the syllogismum on me; he could not at once discover the fallacy. Occam wrote a statement on the elenchum, in which he diligently warns against these fallacies.

Power, wealth and prestige are with the wicked, but we have the wretched Christ Sheflemini [i.e. Sit at my right hand, Ps. 110.], whom we have before [i.e. in advance], after whom they do not ask. May they have the treasures that are on this earth, we have the heavenly [treasures], the word, the sacraments, the ministry [am Worte] [ministerium], of which we know that they have no part, as Ambrose put the emperor under ban, who as victor had cruelly violated children and virgins. When he [Ambrose] was called out of the church by the enemies, he offered them his neck and said: Here | stand, here | will die, standing like a pillar, a fine courage. 

In short, the world puts weight only on present things, but faith has the certainty of things to come. When something unpleasant happens to the world, it says: | would not have meant that; but faith: | knew that the cross was due to faith.

Our dealings with the pope and the whole papist order are nothing else than banishing. But to banish is in fact and truth nothing else than to convict and declare with the word of Christ that the pope and all those who confess him, yes, also all other ungodly people, are such people who are not obedient to the word of the Lord Christ, as when we preach: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved, Marc. 16, 16. If we now, not for the sake of example, but compelled and forced by this text, publicly] say: "The pope together with his crowd does not believe this; therefore he will not be saved, that is, he will be condemned:

Cap. 21. of the ban, or jurisdiction of the churches. § 2-5. 


613 





What is this different than putting under ban, that is, executing what the word indicates? For the ban is the execution of the word of God and His Christ. 


3. from consistoriis. (The first paragraph in Lauterbach, Nov. 16, 1538, p. 168.) 

Then there was much talk about the need to maintain the consistories in order to ward off the wickedness of the people through the ban. D. Briick said: "The noblemen fear for themselves that you will attack [the] peasants and then you will attack them. Luther answered: "If you lawyers only keep your moral laws, only punish honestly, [so] we also want to handle our ceremonial laws and hand over some to Satan according to the flesh, whoever they may be, peasants or noblemen, with the right ban, not the fictitious and void ban of the pope. 

A godless citizen was also remembered at that time, who had publicly confessed before the council that he had not gone to the sacrament in fifteen years. 1) Then said D. Martin said: "When he has been admonished once and twice, | will publicly proclaim him on the preaching stand as a banished person and indicate that he should be considered a dog. But if anyone then wants to deal with him and have anything to do with him, let him do it on his conscience; if he dies in this way, he shall be buried on the shingle, like a dog, and, thus banished, we will make him subject to the rights and laws of the authorities. 


4. letter of admonition from D. L. to N. N. at Wittenberg. 


After the bailiff [Hans Metsch] 2) had despised God, His word and servant, and also the authorities, with his courtly conduct, and had subjected himself to and undertaken many things against them, and had also been fraternally admonished by D. Martin for this reason, he once again sent two captains, MM. N. and N., to him, Anno 1538, Nov. 16, with this note, which the man of God wrote with his own hand, with such words: 


1) Cf. Cap. 19, 815; Cap. 21, 818; Cap. 1, § 93. 2) Bindseil |, 27. 


To tell the bailiff. 

First, that Mr. Fréschel's absolution should be nothing, because he has not recognized himself correctly. Secondly, that he has received the sacrament in his sins and has atoned for them, that is to be borne by him, not by me. Third, if he wants to be a Christian, he must first be reconciled with us preachers, pastors, and also with the council and city, as Christ says: "If you go to the altar and offer your gift," 2c., Matth. 5, 23, 24. Or if he does not want to do this humbly, then | am satisfied in the place of the pastor that he will be saved elsewhere, because | do not want to bear his wickedness, nor be condemned because of his sins. This is the other admonition, according to the command of Christ, Matth. 18, 15. ff. 

(From here to end of § at Lauterbach, Oct. 17. 

1538, S. 153.) 

When Hans Metsch was admonished by Luther for the second time that he should repent, he apologized and answered that he was innocent, that he had no hatred against anyone. But the doctor ordered us deacons before and after that not to admit him to communion and baptism. In the same week he also punished a nobleman, Heinrich Ryder, a great usurer, to his face, and forbade his pastor to admit him to the Lord's Supper, because he dared to take thirty florins a year from the hundred. And so great is the wickedness of the nobles that they dare to boast, without making a conscience, that one had carpentered forty-three children a year; another, should he not take forty florins a year out of a hundred? 


5, admonition of the excommunication, so the dear man of God, D. M. Luther, did publicly at Wittenberg after the sermon, on 

Sunday Invocavit in the fast 1539. 

There has been acry among you that many have made themselves useless, that the ban should be reestablished. Now it is true that | have spoken of the ban, not that one should re-institute tyranny, as the officials do, but of the ban, of which Christ teaches Matth. 18, 15. ff. that one first admonishes one in particular, and then again by two persons 2c. 


614 


We would like to establish such a ban, not that a chaplain or preacher alone should or could do it; all of you must help yourselves, as St. Paul says: With your congregation and with my spirit, that is, with the whole multitude. You must with us, and we with you, that the Lord's Prayer may be said against him who is separated and banished from all Christendom. Again, if he converts, that one prays publicly over him in the church, and accepts again. This is not to be done by a person of the parish priest or captain. 

How? should |, as a parish priest, also watch the bakers baking, and butchers slaughtering, the tailors and millers stealing 2c.? This belongs to the regents. For the sacrament is set for the consolation of sinners who recognize and confess their sins from the heart, have remorse and sorrow over them, would like to have a merciful God and be rid of sin. But if someone is a manifest sinner, whom neither the ruler nor the council punishes; as if some persons publicly scold each other in the street, fornicate, and live in public discord; to such the sacrament shall not be administered, for they have first reconciled themselves with their neighbor; if not, then the sorrowful devil shall give you the sacrament. 

What may | do to be guilty of other people's sins, if | have enough of my own? | have lived evil through my youth, and for fifteen years | have angered God with my monasticism and mass-keeping, and have mocked, crowned and crucified my Lord Christ with my unholy works! Now, if | knowingly let you go to the Sacrament, | take your sin upon myself and make myself partaker of it. How could | be condemned for your sake? It would be much better if | were a shepherd. 

| say this not because | want to rule over you and exercise tyranny; | cannot and will not do it. But ask) thine own heart, whether thou wouldst go to the Sacrament rightly, because thou livest openly in sins and discord. Ask yourself whether you would not give cause to banish yourself; then you will have to confess it, if you want to speak the truth otherwise and not against your conscience. 

For how can | save my soul for your sake? 


Cap. 21. of the ban, or jurisdiction of the churches. § 5. 





615 


be condemned for your sake? Life and limb we dare with you, property and honor, wife and child, house and farm may go, as you see, that we remain faithful with you in death; and it is also right. But that | should set aside my own soul for your sins, and go with you into hell; what would you give me for that? We cannot do that. 

Therefore it is said: 'When we know that you are a manifest sinner, you hurry, you are stingy, you are usurious, you live in discord 2c. Just as here the N. [bailiff] did not get along well with the council and the congregation, and nevertheless went to the sacrament, and remained in discord over it; if | had known, he would have had to stay away from me, if he had not reconciled himself first. So everyone who is unreconciled should stay away from it. For how could | condemn my soul, as | said before? Yes, it concerns not only me, but all of you, that we do not share in the sins of others; a whole city should be punished for such a one. 

| don't know any other way, we punish adultery, murder 2c. If this were not the case, we would pray an Our Father with the whole church against such people, and all those who love God and His Word would have to help banish them, for the banishment is for the whole church, not only for the pastor, the captain or the preacher. 

So | wanted to have begun the banishment, want to do it also, if God wills, at present: when | have first admonished him, then | send two persons to him, as two caplains or others. After that, | will take him before me to the sacristy, or otherwise in the presence of the chaplains, two of the councillors and lords of the castle, and two honest men from the community. If he then does not reform, but continues to live in public sins according to his stiff-necked head, | shall publicly announce it to the church, thus: Dear friends, | announce to you how N. is admonished, first by me, then by the chaplains; thirdly, by the council and caste lords, and those of the congregation, and he will not desist. Therefore my friendly request to you is: help to counsel, kneel down, help to pray against him, and hand him over to the devil 2c. 


616 


Then you should see what would happen: people would not live so publicly in shame, for this would be a severe ban; not like the pope's ban on money, such would be useful to the church. And this would happen where people did not want to convert, and the council or authorities did not want to be diligent in their office and command. But if he mends his ways, he can be absolved again. These are the keys of the church, that sinners may be bound and dissolved. | do not say that one should practice tyranny with it. 

In addition, it is not secret that a citizen's son here, the old S., 1) fell into a public murder, as you all know, and nevertheless went to the sacrament 2) and leda bride to church; | have no favor for that. Now it is said that the matter has been agreed upon by the friends and the authorities; | do not know that, but the council and friendship that it concerns must give letters and seals over it. As long as this does not happen, he shall not stand before me for baptism, choir and sacrament until he shows the council's seal that the matter has been settled before a council. We want to do this because it is a public act, so the reconciliation must also be public; otherwise it is no good. If he brings word from the council and asks for forgiveness of sins, he should kneel publicly before the altar, and the priest should say that he is absolved, because the whole church is offended. This is the ban that not we, but the whole church has; for one must not joke thus, and thus bear hatred and envy, especially murder; that is not fit in any way. 

Moses commanded that if a dead body was recovered between two cities, the city to which the body was nearest must accept it, wash itself, protest to heaven and earth, and testify that it was innocent of it. There shall be neither insult nor joke here; therefore do not blame me, who is commanded to the church regiment, in such. If the guilt is obvious, then the reconciliation should also be obvious.

Cap. 21. of the ban, or church jurisdiction. § 5. 6. 





617 


| would like to do that, but it is not yet time. However, a council could still finely prevent us from doing it; unless there is public hatred and envy against each other, we would keep the ban, but you must help us 2c. This the man of God publicly denounced in the church at Wittenberg on the preaching stand with great earnestness and said on the day and year as indicated above. 


6. a different from the spell. (Lauterbach, Feb. 25, 1538, p. 41.) 


The Elector had returned with other princes and the rumor was that the Elector had ceded the title and the regalia [prerogatives of a prince] to the Bishop [of Halle] and received 60,000 florins and Dahme 3) as compensation. When Luther heard this, he was very sad, but he thought better of it, saying: "If the thing happened in such a way that the Elector respected those regalia so little for the sake of money, and neglected the consciences of the dear people in Halle in such a way, then this would be a great annoyance and a disgrace for the whole house of Saxony. So | would not have been surprised why the fathers ran into the monasteries when they saw that the world was so unstable. If it is done, let it be done, and | shall be sorry from the bottom of my heart, but | do not want to despair and leave the world like the monks. We must get up. The Lord will preserve his own in the midst of trouble. We must not flee into the desert. Even if those regalia are of little use, they are nevertheless to be highly valued out of deference and for the sake of respectability, for my most gracious Lord can gain greatly with the regalia. The Electorate of Saxony is very poor and brings little benefit, and if Meissen did not maintain the duke, he would not be able to maintain himself in the Electorate with forty horses. That is why the princes are given tribute, interest and levies to keep over the regalia for nothing. My lord has great regalia at Halle, the high courts, he can give them the

620Cap 


. 21. of the ban, or church jurisdiction. § 8-11. 


621 





We want to be reproached and told about the beam that stands out in our eyes. 

This is the right and foremost reason that the ban has fallen almost everywhere, because of the fact that the true Christians are few everywhere, and even a small group of few in number. For if we all, as would be right and just, indeed should be, loved right godliness and the word of God from the heart, we would esteem the command of the Lord Christ greater and more precious than all the goods of this temporal life. For this commandment, to admonish and warn the brother who sins, is as necessary as that, Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal 2c.; for if thou neglect this admonition, either for fear or for some other cause, it is not thy neighbor's body and goods that are in danger, but his soul's salvation. And if a pastor knows that sin is openly wicked in the city and country, he is obliged not to admit such people to the sacrament of the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, unless they first repent, that is, stop sinning, and show and prove by true confession and righteous fruits that they are enemies of sin and condemn it; but a Christian and serious admonition must precede it. 


9. the authority of the ban. 


The authorities who, in this play, do not do what is required of them by the ban. And does not punish public offences seriously, as it is guilty of, sins at all. And where she also hinders the church's censure and punishment, and does not want to permit or allow the ban, as Christ has instituted and commanded it, she promotes, fosters, and thus helps to cause offences; so she becomes the servant of God's servant of the wicked devil in hell. 


Do not despise the church's ban. 


Beware, | say, that you do not by any means despise the church's banishment, which has been duly and lawfully done and issued, for it brings with it a certain judgment of God's wrath and eternal damnation, as Chri 





stus says Matth. 18, 18: "Verily | say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Therefore the tyranny of the pope is to be cursed all the more, who has abused the ban, even if a poor man has not been able to pay immediately on a certain and certain day, yes, even if one has not kept his statutes, as if one had not fasted, had not confessed 2c. 

But against us he now needs a ban, so that we publicly confess the salvific teaching of the gospel. But first, the Lord Christ comforts us when He says Matth. 5, 11: "Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you because of Me, and speak all kinds of evil against you. And again John 16:2: "They shall put you under a ban." Secondly, it is certain that the pope's ban is not the ban of the Lord Christ: because it is not done according to Christ's appointment, nor is it done, therefore it is not valid in heaven. But nevertheless it brings certain harm and ruin to the one who abuses this command of the church, for it is such a sin that God's name is blasphemed. 


11. secret and invisible spell. 


But just as this outward and _ visible excommunication and ban applies only to and is to be used against those who live in public sins and are convicted of them, so there is another, secret and invisible ban, which is not of men, nor is it done by men, so that it can be seen, but is God's own, and is done by Him alone. For God does not judge by works alone, as we men do, but looks at the heart, and judges the hypocrites, whom the church cannot judge nor punish, according to the common saying: De occultis non judicat Ecclesia: The church does not judge what is secret and hidden. 

However, not all of them are so greatly burdened with public ailments that they can be publicly accused and charged with some abuse and misdeeds, as is right. For although there are many _ misers, fornicators, adulterers 2c. 


622 Cap. 21. of the ban, or jurisdiction of the churches. § I-15. 623 


But they are so careful with it, they do it so secretly, that it cannot be brought to their attention, nor can it be proved as it should be. 

Therefore they are in the church among the Christian congregation, hear the sermon and God's word, also need the sacraments with the other righteous Christians, and are de facto, in fact, banished by God, because they live in sins against their conscience, and do not amend themselves, according to the saying of St. Paul, 1 Cor. 6, 9. 10: "The fornicators, drunkards and adulterers... will not inherit God's kingdom." 

But God's judgment will not remain outside forever, nor will it be far from them, so that it will not affect them. Men deceive them, but they cannot deceive God, Gal. 6, 7. On the last day He will "send His angels to gather up all the reproaches and throw them into the furnace of fire", Matth. 13, 41. 


How to escape from the secret spell. 


Whoever wants to be free and free of this secret spell of God should beware of sins and repent, that is, improve his life from the heart, always live in the fear of God, pray diligently, and believe that his sins are remitted and forgiven by grace for Christ's sake. This is the only way that one can escape from this secret spell of God. 

But if you continue in sins, and rejoice in them as a privilege and freedom, and want to comfort yourself and help yourself so that you may sin the more surely and freely with others, you will do nothing but deceive yourself, and provoke and cause a harder and more serious judgment against you. For although the outward ban is equal to the secret and hidden ban as far as the end and the effect or effect is concerned (for God keeps watch over it in heaven and confirms it), yet the outward and public ban should be the more preferable to us because it is like a medicine by which we are called to repentance. But the secret and hidden ban, because it is not felt for a while and (as they say) for a period of time, strengthens and increases security. 


The church is built up by the gospel, although there are many hypocrites among them. 


The church, if it is righteously holy, is established and built up by the gospel, as also Isaiah says Cap. 35:8: "And there shall be a way and a high place called holy, wherein no unclean person shall pass." What kind of way is that? you might say. Just the one of which the Son of God preaches John 14:6: "Il am the way, the truth and the life"; item Cap. 8:51: "He who believes in me will never see death." For the ungodly also need the sacraments, and thus cover up their ungodly nature with hypocrisy, as if it were pure piety and holiness. For not all who are baptized remain in the faith, and yet are truly baptized. But righteous faith in Christ cannot remain hidden or secret, it breaks out and proves itself with righteous good works, which God has commanded and ordered. Therefore, Christ is the way that the wicked do not go, and that alone makes the holy Christian church. 


14 From the ban D. M. Luther writes to a good friend thus. 


(This § is Walch, old edition, Vol. XXI, 1505, No. 106, §3, the last part of his Latin letter to Ant. Lauterbach, April 2, 1543, and again in the German transcription vol. XIX, 1254,'s 3 and § 4, which was here). 


15. the church key Heredity. 


Christ has given the church two keys: one to bind, the other to loose, which the pope, as the true antichrist, has made into lock picks and shamefully abused, as has been experienced. But now, because God has again given us His word pure by grace, we are to use them rightly, and not throw them into corners and let them rust, as has happened until now; but make them passable again, so that they can close and open, bind and loose. Bind the reprobate, the impenitent, who lie in public sins, both against the first and the second table of the ten commandments of God: give others trouble, either with false doctrine, or evil living. And since they 


624 


If they are admonished once and for all, and do not want to be at their best, despising all admonition, then heaven shall be closed to them, and they shall be considered pagans, as Christ earnestly commands: give them to the devil, whose own they are ready for, only that one declares it publicly, so that one can beware of them. Until such time as they recognize and confess that they have grievously angered God and displeased the church, seek forgiveness of sin; then they are to be absolved and accepted again, as St. Paul teaches with his example at Corinth. 

These are the two keys that Christ commanded and entrusted to His dear bride, the church, when He said to His disciples (in whose place are now all righteous, pious, faithful pastors and preachers and church servants), "Truly | say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven," Matth. 18:18 and Joh. 20:23. 

Affirm such an earnest command with a hard oath, that what is thus bound and loosed here on earth shall surely be yes in heaven. But first set the binding key, and then the loosing key: for if any man be loosed, he must first be bound. Whoever does not feel that he is bound by the devil in his sins, does not recognize nor confess them, even does not want to have done wrong, thinks that he is free and free; to him one cannot give the loosening key, but must let him remain bound and command God's judgment, consider him a heathen and an unbeliever and let him go in his arrogance and pride: the church cannot prevent him from this, although it should punish it and warn the others against it. 

The authorities have the sword from God and the command to forbid, ward off and punish public false teaching and agitation, both what is done publicly against the first and the other table, so that outward discipline, peace and unity are preserved, God's name is not reviled, nor the congregation angered, nor disrupted and seduced. The preachers and church ministers, however, are only to wield the sword in their mouths, and according to Christ's command, not only teach and comfort, but also punish and frighten, and thus bind and loose, according to God's will. 


Cap. 21. of the ban, or church jurisdiction. § 15. 16. 





625 


The sins of the people. Those who sin and remain stiff- necked in their sins and do not want to amend, are not to be released, but are to keep heaven closed: but those who recognize their sin, confess it and ask for forgiveness, no matter how great gross sinners they are, are to be released, heaven is to be unlocked, and they are to be accepted again as members of the church, and are to be treated kindly with them, with comforting and other works of love. But the impenitent, the proud, the arrogant, and the unrighteous and arrogant of the world are to be punished, and not to suffer, for these are really the virtues of the devil. 


16 The effect and finite cause of the ban, and how it should apply. 

When someone asked whether the ban, because it had fallen in the papacy, should be reinstated, and why it should be done, D. Martin said. Martin: God still wants today and forever that the ban should apply and continue in the church, where it is rightly dealt with to punish the wicked and to keep them in fear, but not to make them truly pious or wicked. For the command that Christ gave to the apostles and all the ministers of the church is not abolished or dead, even if it has not been used for a while or has been misused (as in the papacy); but it still stands firm and must irrevocably remain so, since he says John 20:23: "Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins ye remit, and whose sins ye retain, they are retained." And Matth. 18, 15. 16. 17.: "If your brother sins against you, go and punish him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have won your brother. If he hear thee not, take thee another, or two. ... If he does not hear them, tell the congregation. If he does not hear the church, consider him a Gentile and a tax collector." Item v. 18: "Verily | say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." And St. Paul, 1 Cor. 5:11, 13, says: "If any man be called a brother, and be a fornicator, or a covetous man, or an idolater, or a blasphemer, or a trun- 


626 Cap, 21. Of the ban, or church jurisdiction. § 16-1.9. 627 


You shall not eat with a bandit or a robber. ... Put out of yourselves him that is evil." And John, 2 Epistle, v. 10, 11: "If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not at home, neither salute him: for he that saluteth him maketh himself partaker of his evil works." 

These and such sayings are the unchangeable will, decree and opinion of God, the supreme Majesty: we have no power to change them, or to relax them or to rescind them; but we have a serious command to keep to them with all faithful diligence, regardless of the reputation and power of some people. And even if the ban has been shamefully abused in the papacy and has become a real cane-mastery, we should not let it fall, but use it rightly, as Christ commanded, for the betterment and edification of the church, and not to use it for desolation and tyranny, as the pope has done. 


17. from the absolution. (Cordatus No. 1703. 1704.) 


Est (veritas) non mundum sed non (mendacium) Non claves [veritas] sed "usus 


earum" [mendacium] "Vveriatur". 


In German: The yes (the truth) does not rule the world, but the no (the lie) does. 

It is not the keys that "change" but "their custom". 1) 


The service of the word must continue, even if the listeners are not worthy of it. The gospel is the general absolution, but with the church servant is the private absolution. 


18. self-imposed ban. 


We must not banish our usurers, drunkards, taciturns, whoremongers, blasphemers and scoffers; they banish themselves, and are ready to do so up to their ears; 


1) Meaning: Where truth reigns, the "keys of the kingdom of heaven", the binding and loosening keys, which stand on God's word, cannot be missing. But where falsehood reigns, God's immutable truth is turned into a "false conclusion", as the Pope has done. Cf. Luther's writing on the keys, Walch, old edition, vol. XIX, 1121, especially Col. 1150, § 48. 


They despise the word of God, do not come to church, do not listen to sermons, do not go to the sacrament. Well then, if they do not want to be Christians, they are still pagans, who asks for that? If they take away the goods and income of the parish priests and take everything for themselves, the parish priest shall not absolve them, nor give them the sacraments, nor shall they come or stand at any baptism, nor at any honest wedding, nor at any funeral; they shall thus keep themselves like heathens among us, which they also do gladly. And if they want to die, no priest, no chaplain shall come to them; and if they have died, the executioner shall drag them into the drudgery pit out of the city, 2) there no disciple, no chaplain shall come to them: because they want to be heathens, we also want to keep them as heathens. 


19. ban should be put back. 


We must re-establish the ban, although we have not yet done it by force, so that when we see a usurer, adulterer 2c., we say to him: Do you hear the cry that you are such or such, therefore do not go to the sacrament, abstain from baptism, do not bring a bride into the church. Summa, forbid him everything that is of the church. But | fear in our part, our parish priests will be too bold, and reach into the bodily things, after the property, like the pope; if he excommunicated someone and put him under ban, and he did not comply, he said: "Well, we must also forbid him the market 2c., so that he does not buy or sell. That is the devil, if one wants to reach too far. 

To the ban belong fine courageous, joyful and understanding pastors, in spiritual things well experienced and practiced. We have many of them who have courage and heart in physical things, but that alone does not do it. 

One of them asked, "Does an exile want to go to church and listen to the sermon? Answer: Yes, he should not be forbidden to do so, because in sermons they learn where they are lacking. 3)

156. how preachers are death-beaters. 


Cochlaus is not such a theologian, he is a complete fool, there is still hope in him: but H[archduke] G[eorg], M[arkgraf] J[oachim] 1) belong straight to hell. Zwingel and Oecolampadius have been in the challenge, like the works saints and papists; they speak: | have done evil, therefore | am damned. This makes them speculate and judge according to their reason. When they hear about theology, they say: | have sinned, therefore | am damned. 


3. in which Theologia see. (Cordatus No. 554.) 


The theologians who judge divine things according to their reason [speculative] are of the devil. Theology 


Oecolampadius have missed the way: for all| is practical, not speculative. Zwingli has not in his life 


theologians who handle and judge divine things with reason and speculation are of the devil. 


1) Cf. cap. 24, §115. 


632 


The people believed otherwise, because Christ in the Lord's Supper was spiritual, that is, speculative. Every speculative art, housekeeping and world regiment is lost. He who makes his account in the hand 1) is speculative. Such a one was Christian Goldschmidt with his printing house. If | cannot dissuade him from this, | will no longer serve him. 


4. preach Christ. (Cordatus No. 597.) 


Preaching Christ is a difficult and very dangerous thing. If | had known this earlier, | would never have preached, but would have said with Moses [Exodus 4:13]: Send whom you will. No one was to take me there. That is why the bishop of Brandenburg said to me correctly: "Doctor, | told you to stand still, you will make trouble for yourself, it will affect the holy Christian church. | mean, | made trouble for myself by incurring the hatred of the whole world, since | used to live very quietly. 


5. to do nothing without a profession. (Cordatus No. 1662.) 


Let no one presume to do anything without a profession. But it is a twofold profession; one divine, which is of faith, the other, of love, which is done by one like me, as when my brother minister asks me to preach for him. 


6. desire the office of preacher, whether it is right? (Kummer p. 283 d. Lauterbach p. 144. note)) 


Whether he who seeks a preaching ministry is called? First of all, this is certain: young people must be raised to learn the Scriptures. After that, they know that they are to be called to pastors. If they offer themselves afterwards, if there is any vacancy, it is not called intruding. But he is ready, who demands him, that he knows that he should do it. As a girl is brought up for marriage: if someone demands her, so does 





Cap. 22: The office of preacher or church servant. §3-8. 


633 


they do it. But to intrude means to repel another. But to offer one's service and say, "I will gladly do it, if you need me;" if they accept it, it is a true calling. As Isaiah, Cap. 6, (v. 8.) [says], "Send me, here | am"; comes himself, hearing that a preacher [is needed. And this must be done. One is to see if one may be, and after that, if one will have him, that must also be included. 


(This § reads as follows in Cordatus No. 1663:) 


Those who have studied theology here can ask for an office from the visitators with a clear conscience, because [1 Tim. 3, 1.]: "Whoever desires a bishop's office desires a good work", 2) and such a one does not intrude, because it is in the will of the visitators to consider him worthy or to reject him. 


7. from the profession of Mosi. 


Christ did not say to me, as to Paul, that | should stand up and preach, and | will be with thee; for that | read it in Paul as an example, Acts 9:6. 9, 6. Moses had to go to God six times, and at last he hardly went after many excuses, when God said to him: "I will be with you", Ex. 4, 15. 

But | wanted to take the lawyers as counsel and advice and sue the Lord God in reality freely and punitively, because he did not keep Moses' promise and promise. Thus he comforts in the Gospel, when he says Matth. 11, 29: "And you will find rest for your souls"; but we see the contradiction in John the Baptist, in his dearest son Christ, and in all saints, martyrs and true Christians. According to the lawyers' sentences and judgments, who proceed and speak according to their canons and decrees, he would have lost by far. 


8. comfort for those who are in the preaching ministry. (Contained in Cap. 22, § 94.)

9, What to preach and thus "seek". (Cordatus No. 1462. 1463. 1464. 1465. 34A. 344.) 


When | [Cordatus] was asked by him how | was doing in my ministry and with my preaching, and | answered him about my complaints, my weakness, 2c., he said: "It was the same for me, | was probably as afraid of the preaching chair as you, nor did | have to leave. At first | was afraid of the sermon in the refectory before the brethren, oh, how | was afraid! But you want to be a master right away and perhaps seek praise, and that is why you are so challenged. 

We must preach in honor of God, and not look at the judgment of men. If someone can do it better, let him do it better. Let us preach only Christ and the Catechism. That wisdom will uplift us because it is the word of God; praise and rebuke are none of our business. 

| gave Staupitz more than fifteen reasons when | opposed becoming a doctor and preacher, and when | finally said: You are killing my life, | will not live a quarter of a year, he laughed at me with many words. 

Staupitz was a very wise man, a great lover and promoter of the students. After he was elected, in the first three years [Triennio] he wanted to carry out this work of faith according to his advice, in the second triennium he wanted to carry out this work of faith and attack the cause according to the advice of the fathers, but it had no progress. Thirdly, he ordered the whole thing to GOtte, and it progressed much less. Therefore he said: Let it go as it goes 2c. Neither |, nor the fathers, nor God can do it. Another triennium and vicariate must come. Then | came into it and started it differently. 

My prior Staupitz once sat pensively under the pear tree that still stands in the middle of my courtyard. At last he said to me: "Master, you will receive the doctorate, so you will have something to do. This happened in the fourth 1) year, after

635 


| had become a doctor, in which | published the theses on penance and indulgences. 

When he [Staupitz] met with me again about the same thing under the pear tree, but | refused and gave many reasons, especially that my life forces were exhausted, so that | would not be able to live much longer, Staupitz answered: "Don't you know that our Lord God has many great things to do? He needs many clever and wise people to help him. If you always die, then you must be his advisor. - But at that time | did not yet understand this prophecy, that it should be fulfilled in this way, because four years later | began to fight against the pope and his whole being. 2) 


10. of which church servants will still keep a meager one. (Cordatus No. 1479.) 


The Gospel is preached to the poor, and if the Pope did not feed us from his own, we would all die of hunger. He has snatched the stolen goods to himself, so we must snatch them out again, so that what Job says may happen: He must give to the one whom he does not want, although hardly the fiftieth part comes to the custom of the church. The other he spurns, we hardly get the little bread under the table, because we are hardly fed. And if we did not expect another wage, we would be the poorest people, and | would have the crumbs for a good year. If one will have our little, make us rich and esteem us great, we will blow ourselves out again, for it is the devil that God cannot improve us either by humiliation or by prosperity. We despair or become proud. Paul. 


2) The same narration in Lauterbach, July 27, 1538, p. 102: If | had died before | was promoted to doctor, it would not have been necessary to suffer this misfortune. But there, Staupitzen's prophecy had to come true when | refused the doctorate because of my weakness, otherwise | would die. He answered: If you storm, your God may also go to his regiment. This prophecy was soon fulfilled in me.

boasts of another art in prosperity and in tribulation. 2 Cor. 6, [10.]. Phil. 4, [12.] 


11. preach only as you can, do not imitate. (Cordatus No. 750. 751. 752.) 


When Mag. Joh. Forster complained that all his thoughts were getting too narrow because of his profession, he would rather stay in his professorship, he answered: Oh, that dear Paul and Peter were there, you should probably scold them, because you already would like to be as skillful as they are. Do you want to have the tithes and not first the firstfruits? You have to go forward a little when you can go no further. 1) Do your 2c. And if you cannot preach for a whole hour, preach for half an hour or a quarter of an hour, and do not completely conform to the way of others (as one now desires), you cannot obtain my or another's sermon from word to word, but grasp the main thing in the simplest way and command it to God. Just seek the glory of our God and not the applause of men, and pray that He will give wisdom to your mouth and a sincere hearing to the listeners. Believe me only this, that a sermon is not a human work, neither be bold, but a preacher who fears GOD. For | am an old and practiced preacher, and yet | am afraid to this day when | preach. 

If a preacher who trusts in God also falls out of his concept, he should be sure that he will speak what pleases the people, even if it displeases them, which happens very often. Third, it also happens that what is worked out [conceptum] pleases the preacher and the listeners. These three things are to be remembered, but God must always be asked. 

| do not know how it is that we do not want to preach marriage, because it pleases us the most.

first ourselves, and if we were not forced by our profession, we would not do it. Philip would never have written the Apology if he had not been forced, he would always have wanted to do it better. 2) 


Do not preach long sermons. (Cordatus. No. 798.) 


A long sermon is abhorrent to me, because the listeners lose their desire to listen and the preachers harm themselves. Therefore, D. Pommer is rightly punished for this, and although he preaches long sermons of his own free will and with pleasure, this is done out of error. 


13. D. Mart. Luther's way of preaching. 


Since Martin at Werlewitz had preached a sermon from 1 Tim. 1 before the highborn princes of Anhalt and the young margrave, which is printed thereafter, 3) M. Vitus asked him if he had understood all the parts of the sermon beforehand, for it would be a very good, beautiful exhortation to the highest and most noble divine service, namely, to hear God's word. If one could have heard a mass in the name of the devil every day in the papacy until now, why would one not also perform this service daily, from which the greatest benefit comes? 2c. Read the preface before the same sermon. 


(Cordatus No. 1108, the following paragraph.) 


When | want to preach, | do not design the individual pieces, but only the main thing; for example: an exhortation to worship, that one should hear the word of God diligently; and other things that are necessary occur to me under the speaking. For if 


2) In the middle of the last section was inserted a piece which is found § 55 of this Cap. 

3) Witt. Ausg. I, 456; Jen. Ausg. VI, 32 b; these two editions say that the sermon was preached in 1533 at Dessau. Walch, old edition, vol. IX, 522 and Erl. 19, 296 give the year 1532. According to the last words of this 8, the sermon must not have been held in the city, but in a village. Therefore the indication at the beginning of this 8: "Z" Werlewitz or Worlitz, will be probably correct. Luther was there on Nov. 24, 1532, as can be seen from the letter to M. Hausmann. Walch, old edition, Vol. XXI, 1402, No. 30.

"2c). cuts better than the other. 

A preacher does not have to judge for himself whether he has preached ardently or coldly, but the listeners, and | have often been ashamed of a sermon that others have praised very much, and what we like very much usually displeases others, and vice versa. 

In short, the judgment is up to the listeners.

them. But this is the cause of their praise, that the people admire them, since they hear the histories and examples which they tell, and how they play with words and allegories, in which | am also a master. But in the article of justification, no one is judged to be eloquent, and the people do not like to hear it, nor do they praise it. For this, take it as a certain sign that the people are asleep when we preach the article of justification, and cough; but to the histories they straighten up their ears. | believe that there are quite a number of speakers for these [histories] with us, who preach with their eloquence under the pew and out again. 


20. qualities and virtues of a good preacher. (Cordatus No. 721.) 


Conditions of a good preacher. The first: He must be teachable; 2) have a fine head; 3) be eloquent; 4) have a voice; 5) have a good memory; 6) know how to stop; 7) be diligent in his work; 8) put life and limb into it; 9) let himself be mocked by everyone; finally, that he bear patiently, so that nothing is seen more easily or more quickly in preachers than their faults 2c. 


21. as a preacher shall be skillful, who shall please the world. 


Six pieces belong to a preacher like the world wants now: 


1. that he is learned. 

2. that he has a fine pronunciation. 

3. that he is eloquent. 

4. that he is a beautiful person, whom the maidens and young ladies can love. 

5. that he does not take money, but gives money. 

6. that he speaks what one likes to hear. 


now. D. Jonas has all the virtues of a good preacher: only that he clears his throat so often cannot be considered too good for the good man. 


23 A Preacher's Posse. (Cordatus No. 723.) 

When a certain preacher heard from two Leipzig . students that they would come to preach, he said: "Come, you will see what | will do. When they came into the church, he said, "Oh, dear friends, they are under Pabst's spell; | must not preach any further," and went down from the pulpit. 


24. no measure can be kept, not even preachers. 


Doctor Jonas once said to D. Martino: If the doctrine of the Gospel, that the soul is immortal and an eternal life, were not true, then it would be the greatest cheating under the sun to persuade people of it. Yes, said D. M. Luther, because God says it, it is certainly true, for he cannot lie nor deceive.

27. how to preach in the priesthood. 

(Cordatus No. 766.) 

There was a strange diversity among the papist preachers, especially in gestures and in what they preached about [thematibus], Fleck began "with rejoicing and shouting,” Munzer with singing: "Es fahrt lein Bauer gen Holze," Magister Dietrich: "Yesterday we were drunk and full.” It all rhymed. Well, it was a 


Doctor Luther's housewife said to the doctor that |time to joke; now it is time to be serious. 3) 


she had heard his cousin, Johann Polner, 2) who was otherwise waiting for the doctor, preach in the parish church: she could have understood him much better than D. Pommern, who otherwise deviated far from what he preached and included other things in his sermon. To this Luther replied, "Johann Polner preaches as you women are wont to speak, for what they think of, they also say. Jonas used to say: You should not address all the soldiers you meet. And it is true, D. Pommer sometimes takes along some of those who meet him. But this is a foolish preacher who thinks he wants to say everything that occurs to him. 

A preacher should stick to the proposition and do what he intends to do, so that it may be well understood. And remind me of the same preachers who want to say everything that occurs to them, just like the maids who go to market: if they meet another maid, they hold a pocket market or a stand with her; if they then meet the other maid, they also hold a speech with her; so they also do with the third and fourth, so they slowly come to market. In the same way, the preachers do the same, who nimis procul discedunt a proposito and think that they would like to say everything at once. But they do not. 


1) In this form, this saying is found in Luther's writings, e.g. Walch, old edition, vol. VII, 978, §104. 

2) Hans Polner, Luther's sister's son, is mentioned in Luther's letter to his wife of Aug. 15, 1530. At that time he must have been a young boy, because Luther says: "Hans Polner I have ordered Peter Wellern; see that he keeps obediently. Cf. de Wette, Luthers Briefe, IV, 132. - 


28. three common vices. (Cordatus No. 966. 967.) 


S / Superbiam / A / Avaritiam / L / Luxuriam / 


Keisersbergei 4) in his letter interprets it thus: Avarice [avaritia] of preachers is a gross sin and is leasily recognized. So luxuriation and intoxication are wretched sins, since one gets the sniffles from them in the morning and has aching days. But the pride [superbia] and envy are major sins, which harm the most and can hide under the appearance of godliness. Thus the devil can disguise himself into an angel of light and [into] the bright day. Thus, hope wants to be righteousness, and envy wants to be zeal for righteousness. 

The Christ is well preached [to preach] now, but the world wants to be deceived and turns away from the truth and follows the lies. 


29. righteous preachers. (Cordatus No. 1646.) Just as the bee is a little animal that was created 


ito gather honey, but still has a sting, so there is no 


preacher of such a kind spirit who does not sometimes have to be angry and sting because of the wickedness land ingratitude of the world.

inheritance as a still minor in whose place Luther acts. Cf. Walch, old edition, XXI, Cyl. 1593. 


4) Perhaps this refers to D. Wolfgang Severus (Schiefer), who, from 1539 on, was Luther's table companion, since he is named from his 


birthplace Keisersberg in Styria. (Wrampelmeyer.)

as the two apostles, Paulo and Barnaba, had their hands laid on them. Item Cap. 20, 29, where St. Paul warned the bishops and pastors at Mileto to beware of the wolves. Item 1 Tim. 3, 1. ff. and Tit. 1,6. how a bishop should be called and sent. 

To him he said: "My dear brother Benedicte, you are ordained by God to be a faithful servant of Jesus Christ in N. 2), to promote His holy name with the pure teaching of the Gospel, to which we have called and sent you by God's authority, just as God has sent us. Therefore, watch with earnestness, be diligent, pray to God to preserve you in this high calling, that you may not fall away through false doctrine, heresy, sects, nor through your own thoughts, but in the fear of God, faithful diligence, constant prayer, you may

35. God commands the preachers to preach. 


Doctor M. Luther said: "God has acted wonderfully in commanding us poor preachers to preach His Word, and we are to govern hearts that we cannot see. But it is the office of our Lord God, who says to us, "Hear, you shall preach; | will prosper you, | know the hearts of men. Let this then be our comfort, the preacher: let it always happen that the world ridicules and mocks our preaching ministry, and laugh with us. 


(Here a paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 44, § 23.) 


36. ordination way of D. M. Luther. 


Since D. Martinus ordained M. Benedictum Schumann Anno 1540, April 22, 1) on the Sunday Jubilate, he read the saying Apost. 13, 3., 


1) This time is wrong, because in 1540 the Sunday Jubilate fell on April 18. In 1537 Jubilate fell on April 22. 


part of his prayer. 

Then he laid his hands on him and, kneeling down, prayed the Lord's Prayer aloud. When he stood up, he lifted his eyes and hands to heaven and said: "O Lord God, heavenly, merciful Father, who has commanded us to pray, to seek and to knock, and who has promised that you will hear us if we call upon you in the name of your Son: on this thy promise we rely, and pray that thou wilt send this minister of thy word, Benedictum, into thy harvest, assist him, bless his ministry and service, open the ears of the faithful to the blessed course of thy word, that thy name may be glorified, thy kingdom increased, and the church grow, amen. Therefore, my dear brother, | wish you happiness and blessing, that you may walk in the fear of God and trust in the Lord. Then they sang: Now we ask the Holy Spirit 2c. 


37. where a preacher should look. 

Doctor Erasmus Alberus, since he wanted to go to the Mark, asked M. Luther to give him a form and a way to preach before the prince. The Doctor said: "All your sermons should be simple, and 


2) Naumburg. Bindseil II, 118. 


648 


Do not look at the prince, but at the simple, silly, coarse and unlearned people, which cloth also the prince will be. If | were to look at Philip Melanchthon and other doctors in my sermon, | would not be doing anything good, but | would be preaching to the unlearned in the most simple way, and it would please everyone. If | know Greek, Hebrew, | save that, when we scholars come together, 1) then we make it so frizzy that our Lord God is amazed at it. 


38. ingratitude and contempt makes preachers thener. 


It will go on with us for a long time, as in Hispania and France, where there are no parish priests, but only runners, as with us were the stationers: the same go through the country and preach in every town for a week, and the people must be satisfied with that for the whole year. Whichever town is somewhat rich gives a monk a hundred guilders during Lent to preach for that time. After that, Germany will be wrestling with its contempt and ingratitude. 


Let pure teachers be honored; let them live as much as they can, 


The ministers of the Word, though life is not so perfect, if only the teaching is pure and wholesome, are to be held in honor, love, and esteem, though both would be good for each other. But a false teacher, whose doctrine is impure, deceives one or two thousand, and often more people. 

Therefore, dear brethren, said D. Martin, let us pray, both for this great ministry and the persons who are in it, for you see with what earnestness and zeal Christ prayed before he called his apostles to send into all the world. Satan is now, in this last and evil time, attacking the holy preaching ministry with all his might and earnestness through the tyrants, the fanatics and the false brethren: Therefore, pray diligently that God may prove and maintain His power and authority among the weakness. It is highly necessary to pray.

40. office of a faithful pastor. 


Nurturing and defense must be together in a pious, faithful shepherd and pastor, 2c. otherwise, if the defense is not there, the wolf will feed the sheep all the more gladly, since they are well fed and fattened. Therefore St. Paul, Titus 1:9-11, urges so hard thata bishop be skillful and powerful to present the salvific doctrine accurately and properly, and to shut the mouth of the adversaries and resist them. A preacher must be a warrior and a shepherd; to nourish is to teach, and that is the hardest art: after that he should also have teeth in his mouth, and be able to defend or fight. 

(Similar thoughts in Cordatus No. 1656:) 


A teacher has the right to teach and to instruct. Erasmus does neither, but is ambiguous [amphibolicus], that is, a godless mocker of religion. 2) 


(41) Many washers, though they are learned and eloquent. 


D. M. Luther said: "There are many eloquent preachers, but there is nothing behind them but words: they can talk a lot and teach nothing correctly. Then said M. Phil. M.: The world would have had such Thrasones, glorious shouters, at all times. For it is written that Cicero, the most eloquent pagan in the Latin language, said, since he had heard a great, excellent chatterer speak: he had never heard one all his life who had said nothing with such force and authority. And Erasmus Roterodamus, having heard in Bononia 3) one who triumphed in his oration and towered high, was asked how he had pleased him? He said, "Well, for he has made it far above my thoughts, and as | have meant. How then, said one? Then he answered and said: | would not have thought that there was such a fool in him. Therefore to speak is not an art, but to speak clearly and correctly is given to few. No one should presume to do anything unless it is given to him from above, John 3:27.

The Gospel and its servants are held in low esteem. (Lauterbach, Feb. 19, 1538, p. 33.) 

On February 19, one spoke of Bautzen, where the servants of the Word were poorly provided for. The cities do nothing more than to be more or less at the will of the people, since the authorities 1) have long since thoroughly defiled the papacy. But they still care sluggishly for the gospel. They will also realize this with their damage. 


43, contempt for preachers does not go unpunished. 

M. Luthern was told over the table that the boys of students would have come to M. Friederich, 2) chaplain, in front of the house, and would have mocked him and preached like him. Then D. L. told a story about someone in Kemberg, who had also mocked the priest there: when he was in his garden, he would have sung and preached like the priest, and made fun of the priest; but what happened? the devil possessed the mocker bodily, and plagued him so much that one could neither advise nor help him, and also strangled him. And then L. D. said: "Let our Lord God be satisfied in his servants. 


44, how god orders his preaching ministry. (Lauterbach, April 5, 1538, p. 58.) 

Our Lord God orders His high office whimsically: He commands it of preachers, poor sinners, who say it and teach it, and yet weakly do it: thus God's power always continues in the greatest weakness.

42-47. 651 Counsel: Go in peace, pray to God for sincere harmony. This is my advice to all who thirst for unity, that they first take care that the noise stops, and that the people are instructed in the most simple way without the noise of disputations and quarrels, just as we calm down so that it is not stirred up again, but we have stirred it up enough, we must now let it grow. Therefore, | advise those under the papacy to simply preach the pure gospel without rebellion. If they do that, the pope falls, because he is not in the gospel. 4) 


46. of unanimity of the preachers.

If | had the donum that | could raise the dead, what would it be if the other preachers all taught against me? | would not take the Turkish Empire for this consensus. Muenzer did us great harm in the first. The gospel ran so smoothly that it was a joy, but soon Muenzer came in. Now the pope says: "Well, among us it was all under one head and quiet, but now it is all ambivalent. 


47, lack of preachers the greatest misfortune. (Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, p. 80.) 


On that day he was distressed because he spoke with sobs about the future misfortune of the churches, which would have a lack of preachers and ministers, because they want to have them painted and treat them in the most ungodly and ungrateful way. Therefore, within a short time we will experience misfortune in the churches. Our H(ans) M(etsch) boasted that he wanted to get ten of them instead of one, excellent preachers, and a lot of them.

The Gospel of the 3rd Sunday after Trinity is a wonderful picture of how God is minded towards sinners, how He seeks them with the greatest care. The main part and theme of this Gospel is about repentance, for it speaks of broken and penitent sinners; to whom this Gospel is to be preached. And after that he asked the Lord Cyriacus (Gericke): Did you preach it yesterday? Oh yes, he answered, | emptied my bag purely. Luther answered: "It is time to stop, because | have learned the art. When | have nothing, | will stop. And he told a story of a monk, a beginner in preaching, who practiced and had learned a sermon of eight sheets by heart.

51) Preachers should not be too rich or too poor. 1) 


D. M. spoke of stingy priests, who scratched and scratched, and collected goods as they could, per fas et nefas, sighed and said: What shall become of it? If they become rich, they are no good, they leave their service and office; as happened in Niemeck and Brick to those who had become rich and had fattened themselves and fattened themselves. If they are poor, they cannot leave, as can be seen everywhere.

If only the [fixed] income were left to the pastors, then they would be provided for. Our parish in Wittenberg had only 90 guilders of fixed income under the papacy, but over 350 guilders with the donations. The daily penny from the donations went a long way for monks, terminarians, priests, capitulars, altarists. The common people did not notice that. Now, however, farmers and citizens are getting so rich from it.

It has come to this, since we are still alive.

For they dream such a righteous church as Adam was in paradise, to whom wrath was revealed from heaven, as if God wanted to say: Adam, you shall eat of all fruits, but, if you eat of this wood, you shall die. 


The first of these is the "Theological", which is the "Theology". (Lauterbach, Sept. 25, 1538, p. 135.) 


On September 25, he lamented the future situation of the church, because it would have to suffer a great shortage of ecclesiastics within a short time, because they would be exposed to dangers and efforts, and yet could only leave poor widows and orphans, whom no one would take pity on. They will again have to flee marriage with a fictitious celibacy [celibacy] and then attach themselves again to the citizens and their wives and daughters; if they have these as friends, then their husbands and fathers must also love them. This is how the world wants it, which hates and despises truth and sincerity; it will cause deceit and fraud. 


55. pious, faithful preachers. 


Doctor Martin lamented the fall of the Gospel in the future because of the lack of true, faithful servants: if Pomeranus, Gabriel, Spalatinus die, where will we find capable ones? Orlamtnde could not find one, because it wants to have a house father and house mother there. It will be found, dear sirs, the fall of the gospel is ready at the door, for there will be a lack of people; as we, unfortunately, will see and experience.

For what people do not punish, God 


It is highly necessary for a preacher to distinguish between two kinds of sinners, the penitent and the sure; otherwise the whole scripture is closed. That is why Amsdorf at Schmalkalden said very harshly in the beginning of his sermon before many princes: "The gospel belongs to the poor and afflicted, and not to you princes and lords who live in joy without temptations. It was a_ displeasing beginning and_ captatio benevolentiae 2), and yet it must be, because even the most spiritual teaching of the gospel attacks even the best and most pious minds, as we see in the letters of

have. And indeed we see, unfortunately, the great devastation, that it is lacking everywhere and wants to fail. It is said that in Bohemia in the three hundred parishes, likewise in  MH[archduke] Gleorgsl Furstenthum and in the diocese of W[trzburg] 1) shall stand alone and be desolate. Summa, where one does not have people, devastation, misery and distress, and all misfortune, both in religion and police, in ecclesiastical and secular regiments, must certainly follow. 

Thus, the pope finally broke the Bohemians, made them weak and brought them back to himself: since they no longer had priests and ecclesiastics, the bishops forced the new ordinands with oaths that they had to abide by them and submit to them. We, however, by the grace of God, still keep the justice to ordain in our churches, so that they do not plague and vex us in this way; however, we may see to it that we do not, with our great ingratitude and contempt of God's word, again come into the clutches of the devil's head and his scales, as we well deserve. Although the papists cry and complain much about such our ordination, and rely on the possessorium that they are in grant, yet they must suffer it; notwithstanding that their happy condition annoys us, that they have good days. Just as this kind of trouble also tormented and hurt dear David, Ps. 73:2 ff. But he resolves the argument and puts it to rest, saying, "You prepare them for the slaughter with such fattening. Thus our Lord God prepares the epicureans and the fatlings for the slaughter in this life. 


66. make a lot of words and talk magnificently. 


D. M. Luther was brought a commentary that one had written about the 93rd Psalm, with very many’ words; then he said: "Those who go over with many words and are very germane, they are dangerous and suspicious. For all history shows that the greatest heretics have come from this place, when they can use their talk and their mutterings, and thus

| am very hostile to those who preach according to the high and learned listeners and not according to the common people, whom they do not respect. For to go forth with high and splendid words vexes and breaks down more than it builds up. To be able to say many things in a few words is an art and a great virtue, but it is foolishness to speak nothing with much talk. That is why St. Peter says 1 Peter 2:2: "Be eager for the sensible, pure milk, as the now-born babes, that by it ye may increase." 


67. the preachers’ offering. 


They also remembered the strange ways and gestures of some preachers, who said that there were some in Italy who were running back and forth, shouting and making strange, ugly gestures, like fools and fools. Then said D. M. Luther said, "The world wants to be deceived, and for that you need fakes. For you see how he is vexed and tormented at court: now he wants this one, soon he rejects and repudiates him again. The court is like a whore; when one is soon full, it gives one to another. 


68. old preachers and servants hated. 


The margravine of Lichtenberg 4) indicated to D. Martino how the church servants in Prettin 5) were now old and unable, therefore they should be spared from now on and disposed of. Then he said: "Because we can, we are needed, and then we are beaten to the grass: we are poor, miserable people.

69. world despises all urging and preaching. 


The best and most comforting vocabularies, words and sayings were somewhat hostile to the papists, as: God's justice, truth, mercy. Now, in the epicurismo and the life of a pillar, one no longer respects the words of doom. How should one do to him? said D. Martin said. If the soul is loosed, the body is tormented; if the body is loosed, the soul is tormented. In the past, princes and lords had to be afraid of a lousy monk and priest; now, any town or village may dismiss its priest at their pleasure, since they neither support nor pay him. Summa, if they want to rule over the parish priests and preachers, they may send them themselves and pay them from their own. We do not want to allow them this sacrilege and willfulness, nor do we want to suffer from them. 


70. talk slowly. 


Speaking slowly is most convenient for a preacher, and a fine virtue; for he can thus deliver his sermons all the more diligently and thoughtfully. Seneca writes of the most distinguished Latin orator, Cicero, that he spoke slowly and to the heart; as you also see in D. Gregorius Brick. 


71. schoolmaster to the preaching office best.

Ingratitude against God's servants. 


On July 21, Anno 39, D. Martin spoke of the great, shameful ingratitude of the nobility and the peasants, who refused to give their parish lords even the tithes they owed them and did not want to burden their goods. Then said D. Martin said: "To the same people we should say again: Dear nobleman, you do not want to burden our preaching chair and altar. Oh dear Lord God, the bright light of the Gospel shines very brightly, a terrible storm will follow: let us pray that God's name be hallowed. 


The first time, the first time, the first time, the first time, the first time.

When | descended from the preaching platform, | reflected and found that | had preached nothing or even little that | had conceived and considered.

To be sure, no one is allowed to preach to me and Philippo, although we can also learn something from it that is necessary for us. One does not have to preach and bravely strut about with great words, splendid and elaborate, that one may be seen to be learned and to seek one's honor. Oh no, it does not apply here. 

One should be guided by the audience, and this is what all preachers commonly lack, that they preach so that the poor people learn very little from it; as Bucer and Zwingel did in Marburg, in great splendor, and everything in the most elaborate way, so that they would have the praise of it; as if they wanted to say: See, D. Martinus and Philippus see how | am such a learned journeyman. To preach with simplicity is a great art. Christ does it himself.

77. Proud and presumptuous preachers and teachers. (Lauterbach, Nov. 9, 1538, p. 160.) 


Then he spoke of the foolishness of the clever, who trusted too much in speculative science, since they were inexperienced in things, and experience, the teacher of things, should moderate everything. Therefore the philosophers did very well, whose students had to remain silent for five years, i.e. not pass judgment, so that they would not become nosey judges. And it is not without reason that certain periods for graduation are established at the universities. In Paris, no one receives a degree in theology who has not studied for ten years in the faculty. In Erfurt, only people of fifty years of age were awarded doctorates in theology. Many were astonished that |, when | was only twenty-eight years old, received the doctorate, forced by Staupitz. In short, youth is presumptuous. Thus we see that the jurists in the first year are masters of all laws, in the second people like Justinian, in the third fully trained

could well be understood. Item, in public sermons should not use Eraean, Greek, or foreign languages; for in the church or congregation one should speak, as in the home, the simple mother tongue, which everyone understands and is familiar with. At court, the lawyers, advocates, and orators may well have ornamented words and speak gracefully, but they are well off; Osiander and Mathesius follow and imitate them. Doctor Staupitz, though he was very learned, was a peevish preacher, and the people preferred to hear a bad brother and preacher, who made it simple to hear. For behold how childishly Christ speaks. In parables in churches, neither pomp nor glory is to be sought; there it is to be done badly, plainly and rightly. 


79. world reluctantly gives righteous preachers. 


There was talk about the poverty of pastors and preachers, who were not allowed to demand their promised salary, which they could not pay because of necessity; because as soon as they demanded it, which they had a good right to do, they were told that priests are stingy: "You received it for free, you should give it back for free", Matth. 10, 8. 

Then D. Martinus said: The world is not worthy to receive the heavenly treasure, nor to give anything to the servants: therefore it wants to have impudent beggars and crybabies, like brother Matthes at the prince, to whom the prince had promised to give a fur for his begging and hurrying. But since the steward or the locksmith had not bought him the fur, he said publicly in the sermon before the prince: "Where is my fur? After that, the locksmith was ordered once again to deliver it to him. But since it was forgotten and not respected, he went out again publicly in another sermon in the presence of the prince: "I still do not have the fur. At last, with such impetuous and impudent persistence, he got the fur. Thus the world wants to be driven; with a cheerful heart and gladly it gives nothing, or gives it either forced, or out of superstition and superfluity, for the sake of enjoyment, to earn something with it.

80. from what causes one comes together in churches. 


On June 7, 1545, on the first Sunday after Trinity, Luther was angry and scolded those who murmured and hummed in church when the psalms and spiritual songs were sung. For Christians and God-fearing hearts do not come together in church to bleat and murmur, but to pray and thank God. If you want to roar, grumble, grunt and murmur, go out among the cows and pigs, they will answer you, and leave the church unhindered. 

But on the next Sunday, since some did not refrain from going early, D. Martin soon left the church. Because of this, D. Pommer punished them severely, saying: "You chased our father, D. Martinum, out of the church, you will also chase me out, so that | will not preach to you. 


81: Serious Admonition by D. M. Luther. 


After that D. Martinus began an admonition and punishment sermon: Which unfortunately, he said, is now becoming very strange, indeed we must see vices, vice and wantonness, which have become so entrenched and are gaining so much ground that no preacher may touch them any more, much less punish them, without danger to body and good, or be driven out. For pious, God-fearing, faithful preachers, since they punish sin, are scolded and called quarrelsome, biting, blasphemers of God and man, who attack people's honor, make the authorities contemptuous, and arouse uproar and indignation 2c. 

But listen, dear brother," he said, "why do you pester yourself with ungodliness and offences? Don't you know that the servants of the Church are seriously charged by God with the office and power to punish what is wrong and sinful? If we are to promote godliness through the word, and teach what is right, Christian and pure, then we must truly also punish ungodly beings with their fruits, and condemn what is wrong, false, unchristian and impure: otherwise God will demand righteous blood from us. 

Dear, what godly heart can see through the fingers, and gloss over such- 


668 Cap. 22. of the ministry of preaching or church servants. § 81-84. 669 


abominable great sin, as blasphemy, disobedience, thievery, as selling kofent for beer, usury, adultery, discord, dissension, strife 2c.? In these vices we all shun and have no pleasure, but curse and condemn them. And every householder complains about the great wickedness that is everywhere in the world; he complains and cries out about the willfulness, disobedience and unfaithfulness of the servants, workers, excessive increase of everything that one should only have for necessity in the market, among craftsmen 2c. 

Is it right for you to complain about it; why do you want to shut the mouths of the preachers who stand in God's place and punish? Then they cry out again: Yes, he has meant me. Yes, dear fellow, don't you know that there is an old saying: When one casts among the dogs, he who is hit cries out? That is why you betray yourself with such grumbling and crying, and make it obvious that you are the guilty dog who is hit. lf you do not want to hear it and murmur, go out to the hole that the mason and bricklayer left open; you will have to hear God's judgment one day, who will say to you: "If | did not let you hear it through my preachers, why did you not hear them? You will not be able to excuse yourself. 


Secular rulers should not get involved in spiritual affairs. 


On June 16 Anno 1545 forbade D. Martinus M. Antonio Lauterbach and D. Daniel, 1) pastors of Dresden, that they should not consent to the decrees of ceremonies made at court, nor permit and allow the courtiers such great power and authority; but to indicate to them that they were waiting for their office in the council chamber and chancellery, to govern merchants, country and people, each in his state. According to the saying, Let every man do his trade: let a horseman take care of his riding and his horses, and let a singer take care of his singing; and let no man take care to do or to teach that which he hath not learned. They [may] rule their court, 


1) Greser. Bindseil III, 130. 


and let God and his servants rule the church; we have enough to do on all sides, all our hands full, and to answer for. Let the smart ones, ambitious and glorious Hansen in all gaffes, who want to have five tips of the bag and rule everything, always go and have a good year, they always do the greatest harm in all regiments, can bridle the horse in the butt. 


83. preachers poor people. 


To. The gospel is preached to the poor. Preachers must be poor fellows; but they look to another life, therefore we must believe the future. But if we were to believe the treasure of eternal life, we would become too proud. That is why God has hidden this treasure of His mercy with a great lid that He has placed over it, which is called fides, faith, on which we have to roll all our lives. 


84. take preachers from the schools? 


While they were talking about M. N., Doctor Martin said: "We must now have many pieces of work, and cornerstones, and filling stones: he must deliver a cornerstone. For schoolmasters have been accustomed to talk in school with their pupils, how one should act and interpret the sayings of the holy scriptures in a fine way. | would not want anyone to be named a preacher if he had been a schoolmaster before. 2) Now all the young apprentices want to become preachers, and they flee the work of the schools. But if one has kept school for about ten years, he may leave it with a clear conscience; for the work is too great, and one keeps it small. In a city, however, a schoolmaster is as important as a parish priest. We can dispense with mayors, princes and noblemen, but we cannot dispense with schools, for they must govern the world. 

Today we see that no potentate is lord and master, he must be governed by a jurist and a theologian: they themselves can do nothing,

We pasiors are to watch that ceremonies are made and held in such a way that the people do not become so wild, nor too holy, otherwise they become epicureans, or hypocrites and works saints. 


94. devil's and the world's hatred against pious preachers and authorities. 


To a God-fearing and faithful servant of the church, or in the secular government, the devil is certainly hostile, and sets himself against him. 

(The following at Cordatus No. 558. 1) 


Those who are theologians should persevere and not despair because of ingratitude, because it will happen in three years that they would dig a theologian nine cubits out of the earth. 


95. right way of preaching. (Cordatus No. 1572.) 


The first book of Moses has not been read and understood from the apostles’ time as it is now. If | should preach it now, | would hit it better. For someone must have known the world who wants to understand this book, and every pastor must have looked around in the world. If | were to start the gospel now, | would want to send myself in a different way. | wanted to let unbelievers [i.e. unbelieving people] stay under the papacy and only secretly help the troubled consciences. Therefore, a preacher must have learned to know the world and not have been a monk like me, who believed, because | did not know the world, that people would immediately run to the gospel as soon as it was preached; but now | know that the opposite happens. 


96. the nature and office of a good speaker. A good speaker's office or sign is that he stops when one hears him most gladly, 2) and thinks that he will come first: 


1) Cf. Cap. 73, § 1. 2) Cf. Mathesius, St. Louis edition, p. 216. 


674 


But if one hears him with weariness and displeasure, and would like him to stop and come to an end and resolution, that is an evil sign. So also with a preacher: if one says, | might have listened to him longer, it is good; but if one says, He had come to the washing and could never stop, it is an evil sign. 


97) Poor laymen, children and servants should be the target of the sermon. 


When |, said D. Mart. Luther, | intend to preach only to the servants and maids. For the sake of D. Jonam, or Philippum, or for the sake of the whole university, | do not even want to appear, because they can otherwise read it well in the Scriptures. But if one wants to preach to the highly knowledgeable, and throw out vain rabbis and masterpieces, then the poor people stand like a cow. 


98. faithful preacher burden and sense. 


If 1, said D. Martin, were to write about a preacher's burden and hardship, which he must bear and endure, as | know and have experienced myself, | would discourage everyone from the preaching ministry. For a pious, God-fearing preacher must be of such a mind that nothing is dearer to him than Christ, his Lord and Savior, and the eternal life to come; that even if he has lost this life and everything, Christ nevertheless says to him, "Come here to me, you have become my dear, faithful servant. 


99. what D. Mart. Luthern comforted in his preaching ministry. 


| hope he will also address me on that day; for here he addresses me very unkindly. | bear the hatred and enmity of the whole world, the emperor and the pope with all their attachments. Well, because | have come in, | must see and say: It is right. After that the devil also appeals to me for this, and indeed he would often have killed me with this argument: You are not called; if | had not been a doctor. 


Cap. 22: "Of the office of preacher or church servant". § 96-105. 


675 


190: What a pious preacher should do. 


Doctor Martin Luther said to a pastor: "When you want to preach, talk to God and say: Dear Lord God, | want to preach in your honor, | want to talk about you, praise you, praise your name; although | cannot do it as well as | should. And look not at Philippum, nor at me, nor at any scholar, and let it seem to you that you are the most learned, when you speak of God in the pulpit. | have never been afraid that | cannot preach well, but | have often been afraid that | should and must speak of the great majesty and divine nature before God. Therefore, be strong and pray. 


101. why to preach. 


What we do with preaching and suffering, we do all this in honor of God and for the salvation of the elect, so that they may also believe. 


It is God's work alone, a righteous faithful preacher. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 29.) 


The persecution of the faithful preachers is smelled. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 29, and Cap. 78, § 1.) 


The teaching and the life are to be distinguished. (Contained in Cap. 27, § 95.) 


Balaam, an example of hopeful spirits and teachers. 


Doctor Martin said that Balaam would certainly be damned, even though he had great revelation, no less than Daniel: for he also includes all four emperors, and is a mighty example against hope, so that one does not become proud, and does not exalt himself in God's gifts. Otherwise, if one knew that he would become holy by preaching rightly, few would be saved: but our Lord God can so terribly throw Balaam, Saul, and Caipham, who have been taught by God's Spirit. O be humbled! 


676 Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 106-110. 6717 


166. courting, especially in preachers, does great harm in the church. (Cordatus No. 1145.) Against hopeful people, like Jcarus, the ancients played quite with words, saying: Si vis bene ambulare, Non debes nimis alte volare, Si nimis alte volas, Tunc debes comburere pennas. 1) 


If you want to walk well, you must not fly too high. If you fly too high, you will burn your feathers. 


107 The Hypocrite's Court Ride. (Cordatus No. 482.) 


The hypocrites’ pride is most presumptuous when they humble themselves. We see this in the Pharisee, and yet he smears all his humility with dirt, since he says [Luc. 18, 11]: "| am not like" 2c. 


The greatest harm is done in the churches by arrogance, presumption and ambition. (Lauterbach, Feb. 3, 1538, p. 22.) 

Anno 1538, February 3, Luther and Amsdorf talked a lot about the hope that corrupts the church when it falls for a preacher. Zwingli was seduced by it, so that he did what he wanted, as his extremely arbitrary [superbissima] translation of the prophets indicates. For he dared to despise everything, princes and rulers. Therefore he wrote: You pious princes, forgive me for not giving [you] your title. For the windows are also shining through. Likewise: The Munster's gushers and many others burned with ambition. 2) 


109th Bon Hoffahrt. 


About Doctor Martin Luther's tables In 1542 there was talk of an imperial city that was very 


1) Where these Leonine verses are from is not known. (Wrampelmeyer.) 2) In Lauterbach, this § forms the entrance to Cap, 37, § 34. 


The reason for this was that she had a great deal of business with salt. Thereupon spoke D. Martin Luther said: "| wonder why people are proud. We are born in sins and are in danger of death every moment. Is that why we are shabby and mangy, why we shit, why we ooze, why we stink upstairs and downstairs? In the old days, there were these shaking verses, which were called gnt: 


Cum fex, cum fimus, cum res turpissima simus, Cur  superbimus, nescimus quando perimus. 


What harm is done by ambition. 


At another time, Doctor Martin Luther said that the pride and ambition in the church was doing great harm: because Zwinglius would have been very ambitious, he would also have written in his books that he had learned nothing from me; and | would also not like him to have learned his sacramentarianism from me, because he does not do it well. So Oecolampadius let himself think that he was a great doctor, and before he had heard anything from me, he would already have been in a great reputation. D. Carlstadt also said: "Oh, | care nothing for you. Thomas Munzer preached against the two popes, as against the new and old popes, called me the new pope, yes, | must be King Saul to him, because | would have started, but the Spirit of God would have left me. 

The good man, Oecolampadii, has often lamented me, and | have also been surprised that he should become so bitter against us and spout such blasphemous words against us, since he was otherwise pious. But | set her example before all preachers as a warning that they should not seek their honor in the holy Scriptures when they want to preach, for there they must go down. In Virgilio and Cicerone there is Gloria, 3) but the Holy Scripture wants humility and a contrite spirit, where the Holy Spirit dwells within.

111) Where to seek honor. 


Anno 1541 D. M. Luther said: Honor may be sought in Homero, Virgilio or Terentio, and not in the holy scripture. For Christ says: "Sanctificetur nomen tuum" ; non nostrum nomen magnificetur vel celebretur; for this we are to use the word Sanctificetur. He commands us to preach his word, and we preachers are to be held before the world as injusti, stulti, so that GOD may be justus, sapiens et misericors: that is his name, which he will leave to no one else, and the devil would have to go down over it. But if we let God have His name, kingdom and will, He will also give us our daily bread, and give us our sin, and deliver us from the devil and all evil; but we should not presume upon His honor. What can Jeckel and Grickel do? 1) Jeckel may be a better gracus and more eloquent than |: otherwise | can do more than he. Grickel may be a better Terentianus, but | also understand him well; in other things we are equal. The Elector of Saxony has done well by making Jeckel a court preacher, but has punished Grickel here in Wittenberg. 

D. M. Luther said about the table in 1540: M. Grickel, the poor little man, has a plague and disease, which is called yaivodo€ia. | only complain about his wife and children. He wants to be much more learned than M. Philippus and |; and yet we cannot believe it. He despises D. Pommer very much, who is a distinguished theologian and has the golden art behind him. D. Creuziger is much more learned than M. Grickel. Creuziger is a fine theologian. 


112. by Osiandri and Agricola Hoffahrt. 


D. Luther was astonished at the hope and ambition of some theologians, such as Osiandri and Agricola. M. Luther was astonished at the arrogance and ambition of some theologians, such as Osiandri and Agricola, who boasted a great deal about his life, and let themselves think a great deal, and wanted to burst forth by force and let themselves be seen to be learned; and then he said, "Oh, dear Lord God, if | could do it with a clear conscience. 


1) Dr. Jac. Schenk and Mag. Joh. Agricola. 


How | would have liked to keep silent and watch what they wanted to do! | also understand that they should not break a great sweat from the papists, nor do them much harm. They want to triumph and have not yet won a victory. This causes great annoyance. 

When | first began to write against indulgences, they knew nothing about them, they all pulled in their pipes, and | was completely abandoned for more than three years, and no one reached out to me; instead, everyone left me alone to fidget with the papists. Now they all want to triumph and have a lot of brains in their heads. Therefore Solomon says right: 

Non est finis scribendorum librorum. You will still see miracles when | once will lie in the sand what will be of the book writing. | should now have peace at my age. | should have peace in my old age; but there those want to me, who should otherwise stand by me. | would have enough trouble from my adversaries if my little brothers did not. But who can resist them all? They are fresh young people and have lived in idleness: | am old now, and have had great toil and labor. Nothing makes Osiandern so hopeful as his idleness, for he has only two sermons to preach during the weeks and has four hundred guilders for his salary. 

D. Luther also said in 1541: "There would still be many sects, and Osiander would also cause another one, because his Jngenii way would be that he would have to run over the mouths of others and reprehend them. We have Germanized the Bible; but he takes a word or two from our translation, reforms and masters the same, so that he would have it much better Germanized; since Christianity is not interested in such a trade and vocabulary. And yet he does not even prove that our translation is wrong, and thus annoys the church. Since he could have secretly discussed it with me, but he cannot keep to himself, nor can he hide his art. 

In Schmalkalden | preached the text from the Epistle of John, that Christ dwelt in us through faith and grace, working in us, protecting and saving us. As soon as | became ill in Schmalkalden, he preached 


680 


publicly against me, in the presence of all the theologians who were there from that day, although he did not call me by name, and said: Christus habitat in nobis essentialiter. This greatly disturbed all the theologians, and especially Brentium. But he has his eloquentiam, he disposes his thing and rhetoric according to it, and does not teach the common man at all in his sermons. 

D. W. Link and M. Veit Dieterich, who preach that the common man learns something from it. M. Joachim MGrlein pleased me very much this day with his sermon, where he dealt with the office of women and maids, namely, that a woman should remember that she lived in a holy state; item, a man would be a gift in the house of God. A maid should also know that her position is holy, and her works are holy, good works. This the people carry home with them; but what is puffed up, high and secretly hidden, no one understands. 

| spoke with Bucer in Gotha in 1537 that he and Osiander abstained from such high art, because | do not read or preach for his sake, but for the sake of simple, poor and incomprehensible people. Christ could have taught from a high place, but he gave his sermons in the most simple way, so that the common man would understand. Dear God, there come into the church maidens of sixteen years, and women of thirty years, then old people, burghers and peasants, who do not understand the sharp, high sermons; but he who can bring forth fine parables in sermons, as D. Link is a master of, such the common man keeps: therefore he who makes it bad and just, fine childish, simple, so that people can understand it, he is the best preacher. So | also wanted to make it low and bad. But when it comes to disputing, someone comes to me in the school, | want to make it sharp enough for him, and answer him, he makes it as curly as he wants. | must once again write a book against the wise preachers. 


The sermon is little respected. (Cordatus No. 904.) Although | know that God's word is not respected in my house any more than it is in 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 112-117. 


681 


of our church, | still preach in my home as often as | cannot preach publicly in church, for the sake of my office and conscience, since as a householder | must preach to my servants. 


114. hunger makes the churches desolate. (Lauterbach, Jan. 16, 1538, p. 11.) 


On this day, someone brought Luther the petition of a very poor pastor near Zerbst, who, forced by hunger and poverty, had left his profession. He answered: "These are all preparations for God's wrath and punishments. We do not want to give food to the poor servants, so God will not give us food again. 


How D. Martin came to the trade. 


(Here 19 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 58, § 3; what follows, up to the conclusion, is transferred to Cap. 58, §3, where it belongs). 


This is the first time that the Bible has been used in a book. 

Let us, dear lords and brethren, wait for our office in the fear of God and reverence, with faithful diligence, that is, to present the teaching of the Gospel to the listeners in humility, the fear of God, and in supplication. After that, let us be confident in God, that this thing is, and remain steadfast in such fear of God and honor, and not let ourselves be bitten and torn by it. 


117. preachers are burdensome to the world. 


The Jews with their priests in the Old Testament were well plagued, likewise in the papacy princes, lords, nobility, burghers and peasants, by the mendicant monks; but we preachers are now burdened by our lords. 

The Jews had to give the tribe of Levi the tithe of all goods, and sacrifice so much that no one was allowed to sleep with his wife, he had to give something to his priest; as the Turks do now’. In the papacy, one had to give the priests, the Terminirians and Stationirians as much as one had, and make them rich, and make themselves beggars: but now that we have abolished this, they take from us what is ours. 


682 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 117-124. 


683 





we are supposed to have. So our lords and nobles thank us. Well, they will repent. 

The monastery and church goods belong to the pen, to order the right service: so the spit takes them, and orders the devil's service with it. It goes unequally to God must punish. 


118. student of the Evangelii Epicurer. 


Our students, said D. Most of them are Epicureans, and they measure our sermon according to their liking, and want to have good days. Pharisees and Sadducees have been enemies of Christ, and yet have heard him gladly. The Pharisees because they wanted to see him; the Sadducees because they were able to mock him. Pharisees are our monks: Sadducees our nobles, citizens and peasants. Our nobles, citizens and peasants hear us well, they believe us well: but that they do what they want, that is that they remain Epicureans. 


119. counsel of D. M. Luther, how one should preach now. 

My advice would be to read the text badly now, a chapter from the Bible, pray according to it, and then admonish the people ad Moralia, to good discipline and Christian life; that would be the best preached now, as the world is. But for the sake of the poor afflicted consciences who feel God's wrath against sin (of which there are very few), one must also preach the gospel and comfort them with it. The great crowd wants to have a Moses with horns. 


120. preachers and teachers are despised. 


The world does not want to believe us poor preachers, said D. M. Luther, "Now onward they will not believe us poor preachers. If we had money and were rich, like the papists, we would easily convert them; but because we are poor and have no reputation, they despise us. 


How a preacher should be skilled in preaching. (Cordatus No. 301.) A preacher must be a dialecticus and a rhetor, that is, he must teach and he must 


admonish. He who wants to teach about a matter must first distinguish, then explain, thirdly cite scriptural passages about it, fourthly explain it with examples from Scripture or elsewhere, fifthly adorn these words of his with parables, sixthly punish the wicked, disobedient and indolent 2c. 


122. contempt for church servants. 


Now there is nothing good nor joy in the church servants. Those who are married are despised and chased away, since in former times, when they held mass, especially on high feasts, when the sacrament was Carried around, they had enough honor. In what honor were only the village priests held by the nobles! the gray monks and clogs 1) by princes! Likewise, one saw how diligently the common people ran to the Christmas mass on Christmas night and listened to it. 


The best way to preach. 


(2 paragraphs omitted here because contained in Cap. 19, § 42, sub. 10.) -. 

It is a difficult business to preach God's word and to do good to everyone, and to suffer all kinds of ingratitude for it. But that is why it is called God's justice. The world is not able to do right and suffer evil for it, nor does it belong to its rule. For it is not right that he who does right should be punished or suffer violence, but should receive good in reward and thanksgiving. Again, he who does good to receive thanks and reward is not Christian but worldly. 

Therefore, to do good and receive evil for it, and yet not grumble about it, but to want to receive the reward from God with a humble and right heart, is a heavy and exceedingly grievous thing to do. 


124. of preachers who speak many languages. 


Oh, how | am so hostile to people who introduce so much language in the pulpit as 


1) Barefoot monks. Cf. Walch, old edition, vol. XVIII, 1738, where the Franciscans at Weimar are called HolzschuhbarfiiBer.

125. their priests teach for money, Mich. 3, 11. (This § is taken from Luther's interpretation of the prophet Micah, Cap. 3, V. 11. Walch, old edition, vol. VI, 2832 ff, § 59-67.) 


How peasants have been punished who did not want to tithe to their parish lord. (Cordatus No. 769.) 


There was a complaint that in the duchy of the Palatine the peasants refused to give tithes to their pastors. He called them and said: "You are doing right, because we want to feed the pastors and take twice as much from you. - So you have to learn the journeymen. 


127. preach for the sake of money. (Cordatus No. 604.) Whoever has the desire to preach and to govern, to him his 1) God gives enough. | would not take a thousand guilders for a sermon, which | would do voluntarily and not forced by my profession. For it is for God's sake that one must preach, and serve Him alone with the sermon, not for the sake of the world. 


128: Prophecy and Warning by D. M. Luther. M. Luther. (Cordatus No. 605.) 


However clear and easy the gospel is, it is not for the people, to whom nothing more useful is preached than the catechism. For from the latter they become all too sure, but by this they are kept in fear to some extent. 


129. the world Art. (Contained in Cap. 22, §16.) 


1) of preaching and governing. 


The teaching and the sermon should be based on the listeners. (Cordatus No. 534.) 

It must be preached what is suitable according to place and persons. There was someone who preached that it was ungodly for a mother to look for a wet nurse for her child, and had vain wheel spinners in his congregation, to whom he preached for a whole hour with this single piece. It was also such a man who preached the praise of marriage in a hospital of old men and old women. 


Those who wish to study the Scriptures and God's Word. 


The Holy Scripture, said D. M. Luther, wants to have a humble heart that holds God's word in honor, dear and valuable, and remains alone with the same and holds fast to it, also prays always and forever: "Teach me, Lord, your ways, your rights," Ps. 143, 10. But the Holy Spirit resists the hopeful, does not want to dwell with them. And even though some study diligently inside and also teach and preach Christ purely for a while, God excludes them from the church as soon as they become hopeful. Therefore, every hopeful spirit is a heretic, even if not yet in the work, but, de jure, justified before God. 

But it is difficult that he who has special gifts before others should not be proud and presumptuous, and should not despise others. That is why God sometimes allows those who have great gifts to fall into severe temptation, so that they may learn that they are nothing when God removes his hand. St. Paul had to bear the sting or stake of the flesh in his body, 2 Cor. 12, 7, so that he would not become proud: and if Philip Melanchthon were not so afflicted, he would have strange opinions and views. 

And because Jeckel and Grickel are hopeful and despise their preceptors and good arts, | fear that it is over and done with them; they are gone. | know the spirit of Minzer, Zwingel and Carlstadt. Hopefulness thrust the angels out of heaven; therefore humility in studying the holy scriptures. 


686 


132. theologians should read the rights of the pope. 


Every theologian should read the Pope's Drecket with diligence, et cum judicio. For St. Paul says in 1 Thess. 5, 21: "Test everything.” But the word of the Gospel is not to be tested, but, since it is pure, it is to be heard straightway. For the Father gives earnestly, by His voice sounding from heaven, and says, Matt. 17:5, "This (Christ, My Son) ye shall hear." It is a matter of hearing, and not of asking why, of mastering, nor of reforming and interpreting according to our reason and philosophy. 

But praise be to God that our doctrine agrees with God's Word, the Sacraments, and the Lord's Prayer. The doctrine of the papists is totally contrary to this. John the Evangelist lived after Christ for sixty-eight years and suffered much externally and internally. Under the emperor Nero he came out of the Patmos again. 

133) How to deal with angry priests and preachers. 

(This § in Lauterbach, Jan. 16, 1538, p. 13. Cf. 

Mathesius, St. Louis edition, p. 203.) 

There was a complaint about an uncouth and angry pastor. Luther answered: "| do not pray for such people. If they cause trouble, they should be imprisoned and deprived of their office. Therefore, the Elector decided to build university prisons to keep the angry priests in check. 


What a preacher is. 


A preacher is like a carpenter, his instrument and tool is God's word: and because the audience with whom he has to do and work is varied and diverse, he should not always sing one song and present the same teaching; but, since the audience is diverse, he should at times be angry, frightened, punished, scolded, comforted, and atoned for. A man is so willing and ready to teach all others, except himself! 


How M. Luther wanted to make one a preacher. 


| easily wanted to make one a preacher if he wanted to follow me, for | 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 132-139. 


687 


would have him take the small Catechismum in his hand and read from word to word from the pulpit. On Sundays, however, he would read a piece of the Postil and then repeat what he had read. But they are ashamed of it; so I, now an old doctor, still take the book with me to the pulpit and read from it. 


136. What Dr. M. Luther Learned in the Ministry of Preaching. 


In the preaching ministry, | learn what the world, the flesh, and the devil's hatred and wickedness are, which one could not recognize before the revelation of the Gospel. At that time, | thought it was no longer a sin, but fornication. 


137. preaching well is now. 


Now it is much easier to preach than in the priesthood, because it always comes up and happens that one has to preach and talk about either the church, police or economy, justification, faith, patience, love, prayer, and other articles of Christian doctrine. 


138. court sermons. 


At court one should keep this rule, that one shouts and complains quickly. If one does not want to hear once, that one supplicate again. For modesty and the gospel do not belong at court. Court; but one must be angry, insolent, complain and lecherous. One must put Moses with the horns in the court, not Christ, who is kind and gracious. That is why | advise my pastors to complain to the court about their misery, poverty and need. For | have preached publicly before the prince, that the prince is indeed pious and righteous, but the people do what they want. For the sake of the word, some at court have accused D. Jonam and M. Philippum, to whom they gave this answer: Luther is old enough and knows what he should preach. 


139. some word of god gives a sermon. (Contained in Cap. 1, § 9. Para. 6.) 


688 


140. unworthy of preachers in the world. (Cordatus No. 931.) 


Preachers count for nothing in the world, and yet the world cannot do without them. For as long as death reigns, the work of preachers is necessary, and in ‘death they desire ours, and if there were no death, | would not look at a preacher either, for they can do nothing but scold people. But death also includes the way of life and everything that concerns the conscience. 1) 


141. from Osiander. 


Osiander, said D. M. Luther, is a learned man, who should sit over the Bible and make Glossam ordinariam. Then said one, Doctor, Osiander cannot teach low things. Yes, said D. M. Luther, it is true, | am surprised that they cannot lower themselves according to the mind of the listeners. There are children, servants and maids who go to church, to whom one must preach, they are allowed to hear our sermon, not the scholars. If | alone were to preach to D. Hieronymo 2) or Philippo alone, | would not want to preach a sermon for the rest of my life, because they understand it well. But for the poor youth and the unintelligent man it is too much, there one must let

| will not answer Cochleaeus on any book against me, and [he] will become much more angry with it, and | will [not] do it for the sole reason that he will not gain the honor he seeks in his writing. 

He also had a letter written to him by one of these clowns, which he read and said: "Art cannot remain hidden; when the belly wants to burst, it is time to get rid of it by preaching and writing. He said this with a sneer, and added: Presumption and presumptuousness is the head of the serpent. 


143. serious saying of D. Luther. (Kummer, zweiter Theil x. 375 b. [Lauterbach p. 203 f.]) Cursed be every preacher who strives for high

Against the smarties. It is a very good lie against presumptuous mongrels that a fly had sat on a load of hay, and when one drove in, it was very dusty. Then she said, "Oh, hell, what kind of dust can a fly make?

to the lowest level, | do not look at the doctors and masters, of whom there are barely forty, but at the hundred and thousand young people and children, to whom | preach, and to whom | make myself comfortable, they may also hear it. If the others do not want to hear it, the door is open to them. Therefore, in the church one must make the greatest effort to be clear and simple, to look at the children and the simple, as a nursing mother does with her child. She fondles the child childlike and gives it from her bosom; she may not drink wine or malmsey, but has the best- known drink in her breasts. So also must the preachers be in their sermons in the church. But when they are in the disputations of the learned, they may let themselves be heard in his place, how learned they are; there they shall lack art. But to mix Greek, Ebrew, Latin into the sermons is to be wise in an unsuitable place, namely, that the people should be astonished and praise them.

144: With preachers, court keeping does harm. 


Doctor M. Luther spoke of a theologian in the Oberlande when Zwingl was mentioned and said: "N. N. is a Nequam per omnes casus, per omnes partes orationis, per omnes regulas generales Grammatices. | trust him no more, for St. Paul saith Tit. 3, 10. "Haereticum post unam aut alteram admonitionem devita." Another said, "I think that ambition and wealth make people so proud. Then the doctor said, "That a maiden should be resplendent in a new skirt, or with black eyes, that will go well; for soon a fever will come, and take away her beauty. And the fact that Mornholt and Ranzau, both my table companions, are hopeful, that also goes well; for soon some pestilence comes and takes away their hope. A nobleman, who is trustworthy, gets a bullet through his body in a war, and that's the end of it: but the Gloria religionis does excellent damage. This is what Luther said in 1542. 


A great complaint of Luther's about his addiction to honor and courtly conduct. 


(Contained in Cap. 37, § 33, sub. 3.) 


Preachers should be humble. 


D. M. Luther once said: "For my sake | do not write a book, nor do | preach for my sake, for | have already written it in my heart. What | know, that | know. My Adversarii bring against me vain loose argumenta, which | would know better to lead, than they. But we write for the sake of other people, so that the simple sheep may be protected from the wolves and those who err may be converted. And it is a true word in Theologia that those who know something know nothing. For he who hears and learns God's word cannot be sufficiently amazed at it, nor learn it. Let one humble himself only, so that he may remain a disciple in it. 

The same is found in Politia, that those who are good men of war and fine rulers of the world do not boast much about it, nor do they gloat over it, but 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 144-149. 


691 


live in the fear of God, and see that they learn more and more. But the common man, and especially the broad merchants and the shrewd, despise such fine people. So it often happens in economy: those who are richest of all pretend that they are poor and have nothing. But it is said: Beware of can-do's. If you strike an empty barrel, it sounds bright, but a full barrel does not sound very loud. 


147. preaching or reading in front of scholars. (Cordatus No. 1245.) 


When | give lectures, | make the cross for myself and think that there is [not] Philip, D. Jonas, Pommer, or any wiser person in the lecture hall, and let me think that there is no wiser person on the lectern than | am. 


148 A Doctor Theologia. 


A Doctor of Sacred Scripture should be able to read and comprehend the Bible 1). Item, how the prophets go in and on each other, not only one piece; as, that one Jesaiam can, not only one article of the law and Evangelio 2c. Now, however, they become Doctores, since they hardly understand only one article correctly. The jurists can humble their disciples, if they want to pride themselves on their art, because they have their court cases and practica. But we theologians, because we do not have the Practicam, cannot humiliate our disciples, and untried ones, especially theologians, should be nothing. 


St. Paul diligently studied and interpreted Moses and the Prophets. 


In the Psalm it is said: In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum: "Their cord went out into all the world", Ps. 19, 5. But St. Paul, Rom. 10, 18, translates it that their sound went out into all the world; such is now equal to one. 

There are many sayings of the Bible, as St. Paul kept the version of the seventy interpreters, because he did not despise them; for he was the preacher of the Greeks, therefore he had to 


1) Cf. § 32 of this Cap. 


692 


to speak to them as they have failed. So he also used the saying 1 Cor. 15, 55: "Death is swallowed up in victory"; because in Hebrew it says: in finem. And yet it is one thing, in finem, in aeternum, that death shall not come again in in Victoriam, id est, Vita vincet. St. Paul is very rich and superfluous with words: one of his words has probably three Orationes Ciceronis in it. He often speaks one word that runs through the whole Jesaiam or Jeremiam. O, St. Paul is a fine preacher, he is not called Vas electum in vain. Our Lord God says: | will give the world a preacher who shall be excellent. There is no one who understands the Old Testament as well as he does; | exclude John the Baptist. St. Peter is also excellent. 

St. Matthew and the others describe the histories diligently, and this is also highly necessary; but the res and verba and vim verborum of the Old Testament, what power is behind the words, they do not report. St. Paul has translated many Hebrew things into Greek that no one else could do. He often interprets four, five or six chapters in one chapter. Oh, he loved Isaiah and Moses, for these are also the most distinguished prophets, along with King David. The Verba and Res St. Pauli are taken from the prophets and Moses. Therefore, the young theologians should study Hebrew, so that they may contrast the Greek and Hebrew words and see the same quality, nature and power. St. Paul made the saying Rom. 4, 3: Et imputatum est ei ad justitiam, so useful to him, and yet in Hebrew it only says: et cogitatum est. If | were young and wanted to become a high theologian, | would confer Paulum cum Veteri Testamento. He was a mighty dialecticus and rhetoricus. 


150: Luther's advice on how one can become a good theologian or preacher. 


Whoever now wants to become a theologian has great advantage: for first he has the Bible, which is now so clear that he can read it without any hindrance. Then he reads the Locos communes Philippi, which he reads diligently and well, 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 149-152. . 


693 


so that he even has them in his head. If he has the two pieces, he is a theologian, whom neither the devil nor any heretic can break off, and the whole theology is open to him, so that he can read everything he wants ad aedificationem. And if he wants, he can also read Philippi Me-lanchthonis Commentarium in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos. If he then also reads my Commentary in Epistolam ad Galatas, and in Deuteronomy, | will then give him eloquentiam et copiam Verborum. 

You will find no book among all his books where the summa religionis, or the whole theology, is finer than in the Locis communibus. Read all the Fathers and Sententiarios, and it is nothing compared to all of them. Non est melior liber post scripturam sanctam, quam ipsius loci communes. Philip is tighter than |: ille pugnat et docet: | am more a rhetoricus, or a washer. If the printers wanted to follow me, they would have to print only the books that have doctrinam, as ad Galatas, in Deuteronomy, item, the sermons in the four chapters of John the Evangelist. The other books of mine should be read pro cognoscenda Historia revelati Evangeli, that one may see how the doctrine has first begun, for it has not been so light as now. 


151) Whether one can be in the ministry without marital status. (Cordatus No. 1162.) 


If someone who is called to the priesthood is allowed to preach the gospel, but under the condition that he remains celibate, he cannot leave the profession without a good testimony, by which 1) the sin is put on the conscience of the listeners. And indeed God has made marriage a plaster, which he can use over his weaknesses, who cannot remain celibate; but it shall be well with him under the 


papacy. 


152. by Nicodemi Gleichen. 


Whether one would also have the power to do so if he came to the papacy, and one or their

more there desired to teach them the Word of God secretly, perhaps for fear of the authorities; how far he had power to do this, and with what modesty he should do it, since he is not a preacher? 

Martin Luther's answer: If he is asked to give a lesson, he may tell his neighbor how and what he believes and what is to be believed, as otherwise two journeymen chat with each other. But he shall not refrain from preaching or preaching office, nor shall he interfere with the preachers in their office. 


153. preach according to the art. (Cordatus No. 525.) 


Those who have knowledge of a thing can easily speak of it. For the knowledge of things is followed by the art of speaking. Therefore, those who, without understanding the matter, want to shine through art, fail. | cannot make a sermon according to art. 


A theologian must be pious. 


A lawyer can be a prankster, but a theologian is a pious man. Cause: for a lawyer deals with physical and temporal things; but a theologian with spiritual and eternal things, to whom God entrusts Himself, His heaven, and all His gifts and treasures, forgiveness of sins, righteousness, and everything. A pious man belongs to this. For God says: "Whomsoever thou forgivest sin, | will count him as my child. 


Whether a preacher is also obliged to go to the sick. 


When someone said that two preachers had died of the pestilence in Nuremberg, the question was asked: "Should a preacher, who alone is appointed to the ministry of preaching, with a clear conscience deny his service to sick people at the time of the pestilence, so that he does not visit them? Luther answered and said: "By no means, the preachers must not flee too much, so that they do not make the people too fearful. And that one sometimes says that one should spare the pastors and preachers, and not make them too afraid at the time of the pestilence. 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 152-155. 


695 


The reason for this is that if the pestilence ever took away some of the chaplains, there would be others to visit the sick. That is why, if the pestilence sometimes takes away some of the chaplains, others are available to visit the sick. Item, so that not everyone shuns the priests at such times, as it is seen that no one wants to go to them, and everyone flees them. For this reason it would be good not to burden everyone with them, but rather one or two. 

If my fate were to strike me, | would not shy away or be afraid. | have now endured three pestilences, have also been with some who had them, as Schadenwald, who had two of them, | understood them well. But it did me no harm, praise God! | came home the same time, and grabbed my Margarethen, who was still small at the time, around the mouth with unwashed hands; but | had truly forgotten, otherwise | would not have done it, because God would have tempted me. 

It pleases me well of the Jews that they draw the 91st Psalm: "He who dwells under the shelter of the Most High" 2c. (Qui habitat in adjutorio altissimi etc.) to the pestilence. | wanted to have interpreted it finely, but | was worried that the psalm would be prayed against the pestilence, just as St. John's Gospel was prayed against the thunderclap. When the mass was over, the priest read St. John's Gospel in a loud voice, and whoever had heard the Gospel read was free. Therefore, they brought a fable to the pulpit to confirm their lies, namely: How the three of them were riding together, when a storm came and they heard a voice: Strike. Then one of them was struck down. The other one said again: "Strike! The other one would have been knocked down. Soon another voice was heard: "Strike! And another voice: "Don't strike, because he heard the Gospel of St. John today. This one had escaped with his life. This is what they preached to confirm their idolatry. 

Item: the story happened with one, who was supposed to be the Lucas painter, then living in Gotha with her father, who was sitting with his tailor in the castle, and had beautiful colorful clothes made for him for the inn. So the tailor looks out the window and becomes aware that a weather 


V96 


And he cometh, and saith, | will go and take palms, and cast them into the furnace: for | have not heard the gospel of John this day. Go out and do so. The young man said, "What are you saying? Do you think that the priest alone can read the Gospel? | can read it as well as he. Open the window, lift it up, and run: In principio, etc. Then the thunder strikes in, and knocks the pants off the legs of the young, handsome, rich journeyman, so that he soon falls down and dies: but the tailor's sole is knocked off under his feet, but he does not die. This story has certainly happened. 

But that farmer was even better. When a weather came and a thunderclap happened, he made four crosses and said: Matthew, Marcus, Pilate, Herod, these four evangelists, he said, certainly help. It was a miraculous thing in the papacy, the young fellows know nothing about it. 

Then someone said, as in a small town, not far from the Naumburg, the priest would be 


Cap. 22: Of the preaching ministry or church servants. § 155. 156. 


697 


died of the pestilence, as did the schoolmaster. Now the people there were stubborn like beasts, without any sacraments, because they did not want to keep a chaplain nor pay him, even though the pestilence was not yet reigning. Then said D. M. L. said: "It serves them right, since they otherwise think that preachers and chaplains are not allowed, and they can well do without them. So the people of N. did not want to feed or maintain their pastor; | said to the judge, "How can you not want to maintain a pastor or a pastor, and keep a shepherd, to whom you must give whatever he wants? Then said he, Yea, my lord, we cannot well do without it. 1) Therefore you see why they are concerned only about the belly. What they wear, they love, nothing else.

The 23rd chapter. 


Of the angels. 


1. what an angel is. 2. how and what to teach about angels. 3. of good and evil angels. 


1. what an angel is. 


Doctor Martinus was asked by one, "What is an angel? He said: An angel is a spiritual creature, created by God without a body, for the service of Christianity, especially in the church ministry. Ps. 103, 20. Ebrews 1, 14. 


2. how and what to teach about angels. (Lauterbach, Sept. 29, 1538, p. 137.) 


On this day, because it was the feast of Michaelmas, he spoke a lot about the angels, how their knowledge was necessary in the church. Therefore, godly preachers must be eloquent and pious. 


The angels are our patrons. 5. history, how an angel protected a child. 


preach from this doctrine. For the dialectical passages are the main seat for the proofs, especially the more excellent passages, which are taken from the explanation, division and causes. Therefore, whoever wants to speak of angels in a godly and appropriate manner must first explain what angels are, namely, spirits and incorporeal beings. Second, the division: What kind of spirits? namely, good and evil. Here we must speak of the evil spirits, which were not created by God, but fell through hatred of God. They have exercised this hatred against the Church in Paradise and at all times, and it will last until the end. 


698 


Therefore the angels are not such ungodly spirits, but good ones. Thirdly, it must be said of their ministry that they are the ministering spirits of the pious, Ebr. 1. Here the pious are truly given a great comfort and example of humility, that the purest angels serve our business, even the filthiest, in the household, in the government of the world and in religion. There they are our most faithful servants, doing the works of which even a poor, miserable man is ashamed to serve another. Thus we must speak of the angels appropriately on the basis of the dialectical passages. Those who do not take these dialectical passages into account may well say many things that are inappropriate to the matter, but they will build little. 


3. Bon good and evil angels. (Cordatus No. 1050. 1051.) 


The angels are very close to us and protect us and the creatures of God according to his command. But they have long hands to defend themselves, so that they can easily drive away the devil when he wants to harm, and they come to us very quickly without effort, since they stand before the face of the Father next to His throne; and the devils are also very close to us, pursuing our salvation and our life at every moment. But they are prevented. The angels are prevented from doing harm, so they do not always do harm, although they always want to do harm. 

Many evil spirits are in the forests, in the waters, in swampy and desolate places, so that they do not harm people; others are in dense clouds and excite storms, thunder, lightning, hail, pollute the air. Our philosophers and physicians attribute this to nature, and | do not know to what causes 2c. 1) 


4. The angels are our patrons. 2) (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1660.) It would not be good for us to know that such a 


careful and strong guard of angels was for us; for we would be lazy, even well 


Cap. 23: Of the angels. § 2-5. 


699 


We would despair if we saw that a devil was causing so much trouble for so many angels. That is why the scripture only says: "He has commanded his angels over you", as if he wanted to say: Do not be distressed, do not doubt or despair; for it is certain that you will be protected by angels. But how this happens, you should not worry about it. 

In Job, Cap. 4:18, itis written: "Behold, among his servants there is none without change, and in his messengers," or angels, "he finds foolishness," that is, in the wicked. 

D. M. Luther once said of the angels: This is my imagination, and | am certain that the angels are already in armor, and are putting on their armor, and are girding themselves with weapons; for the last day is already dawning, and the angels are arming themselves for battle, and want to plunge the Turk with the Pope into the abyss of hell. 


5. historia, how an angel protected a child. (Lauterback, July 7, 1538, p. 96, tells this story as follows:) 


Then they said many things about miracles. A little girl had gone to the field to look for the cows, but got lost in the forest and, overwhelmed by a great snowfall, got lost there. She remained lost for three days. Finally she was found by her family under a tree. It was a large perimeter where there had been no snow, and when she was called, she answered: Hiev | am, | am waiting for the cows, as if she had waited only one hour. There God has been the protector. 3) 

Doctor Caspar Creuziger heard this story from Luther himself: That not far from Zwickau, in the Voigtland, in a village it had happened that a child, who was able to walk and talk, in winter, not far from the village, had lost itself in a wood and was late, so that it had to stay in the wood at night. 


3) Luther's own selection of this history is found in the Hauspostille. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIII, 2644, § 18. -

1. A godless person is a conterfei or image of the devil. (Contained in the next following § 2 of this chapter.) 


2. the devil's image and likeness, from the ten commandments. 


(The first paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 11, § 24, para. 2. The following is found in Cordatus No. 786 and 787). 

As God is the thesis of the decalogue, so the devil is the antithesis of it. Therefore, whoever wants to see the devil, let him look at the reverse Decalogue. His head is against the first tablet, that we should not trust God, not love God, not fear God, which he demands of us in the first commandment. In the second, he tempts us to blaspheme, to murmur against God, and to abuse His name with the mouth and with the tongue. In the third, he incites us not to listen to God's word, but to doubt it, to despise it and its servants, and to misuse the word. These are the ears and the throat of the devil. The second tablet contains his body. In the fourth commandment he teaches to despise parents, not to obey them, not to support them, to be ashamed of them and dishonor them, to be rebellious against the authorities, this is the devil's chest. The fifth commandment [of the devil is] to kill, to be angry, to hate, to resent, to envy and to harm everyone, that is the heart. The sixth, to be a fornicator, an adulterer, an incestuous person, a_ soft-hearted person, shameless in words and gestures; this is the belly. The seventh is to help no one, to rob everyone by trickery and violence, to steal, to usury, to sell false goods or more than they are worth; this is the hands, the big finger. The eighth is to degrade, doubt and defile the good life of men; that is his will. Such a friendly image is the devil. 


After that, whoever wants to know the devil, imagine a completely desperate man, of the most evil life and conscience, there you will see the devil incarnate, as Christ depicts the boy with very few words, saying: He is a liar and a murderer. A liar against the first tablet, because

He constantly incites people to false teachings and opinions. The holier the people, the greater the temptation. This is also the Moloch service, which had the greatest appearance of all, but was the greatest lie, which led to the murder of the own, most beloved children, whose blood this murderer shed, whom he nevertheless proclaimed to be the most holy, just as those were respected most holy by the people, who pushed the most children into the monasteries under the papacy. Furthermore, what he intends to do in the world with these two [lies and murders], we often learn. Everyone avoid him as much as he can. 


(The last paragraph contained in Cap. 5, § 5.) 


3. the devil is a crafty, cunning spirit who can shamefully blaspheme and pervert even the best works that devout Christians do by grace and the power of the Holy Spirit. 


(Composed of Cap. 24, § 59 and Cap. 27, § 153.) 


(4) Why the devil is an enemy to true Christians and attacks them so harshly and swiftly. 


The devil must be an enemy to us, because we are against him with the word of God, destroying his kingdom 2c. But now he is the prince and god of the world, and certainly has greater power than all the kings, princes and lords on earth: therefore he will certainly want to take revenge on us, as he does without ceasing, and we also see and feel it. 

On the other hand, we have nothing more from the world, for as great as we are, what is in our pants and vest, namely the flesh and blood, is from the world. The spirit, however, is the small booty, where the patronage money, the Hungarian gold, lies inside. He should and must leave it untouched and unchanged, and have no thanks for it. 

Moreover, we have a great advantage against him, even if he were so wicked, cunning and powerful that he cannot harm us; for we have not sinned against him, but against God alone; as David Ps. 51:6 says, "Against you alone have | sinned. "2c. But God is gracious and merciful, patient and 


7106 


big, and of great kindness to all those who hold to Christ, whom he has given them as Savior. 


5. the devil torments us with our sins, since he is the cause of all sins and evil, as if we deserved eternal punishment by them; therefore he is called a blasphemer and a reprobate. 


(The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1524.) 


Is it not a pity that the devil wants to condemn us by his inspirations, since he is far worse than all of us, and what does it matter to him that | have sinned? We do not sin against him, but against God, and he has not given me a law which | transgress, but God. Therefore it is said [Ps. 51:6], "Against you alone have | sinned." 

But we know by the grace of God that we have a gracious God and a merciful Father in heaven, whose wrath and displeasure against us Christ, our Lord and Savior, has reconciled through His holy blood. Since we now have forgiveness of sins and peace with God in and through Christ, the sorrowful enemy must leave us alone. So that he can no longer accuse us of having sinned against God's law; for "Christ has blotted out the handwriting” of our conscience, "which was against us" and testified, "and has taken it out of the remedy and put it on the cross," Col. 2:14. To God be glory, praise and honor in Christ Jesus forever, amen. 

D. Luther said in 1533: "Every night when | wake up, the devil is there and wants to dispute with me; then | learned that if the argument does not help, quod Christianus est sine lege et supra legem, then he should be dismissed with a fart. The villain, he wants to dispute with one de Justitia, and yet he himself is a knave, quia he wanted to push God out of heaven, has crucified his son. Nor shall any man be alone contra Satanam. God has appointed Ecclesiam and the Ministry Verbi to join hands and help each other. If one person's prayers do not help, another person's will. 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 4-7. 





107 


(6) The devil guides and rules the hearts of all the wicked, so he knows what they are thinking, and can sometimes tell and guess what they are thinking. 

through his servants, what is to happen in the future time. 


The devil knows the thoughts of the ungodly, for he gives it to them: he controls and governs all men's hearts that are not guarded with God's word, yes, he holds them captive in his ropes, so that they must think, speak and do according to his will, 2 Tim. 2, 26. And 2 Cor. 4, 4. says St. Paul: "The god of this world blinds the minds of the unbelievers, so that they do not see the bright light of the gospel" 2c. And Christ shows how it happens that many hear the word and yet do not understand it nor keep it: "The devil," he says, "comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe nor be saved," Matth. 13, 19. Therefore it is no wonder that he sometimes begs beforehand and proclaims through his prophets what happened afterwards. He could easily have guessed the outcome of the Bavarian war, for he saw that Count Palatine Ruprecht was proud and rich, and that he was bold enough to despise Emperor Maximilian. Again, he noticed that Maximilian had an honorable, sincere mind, and therefore wanted to be disrespected; this is why the same war arose in 1504. 


7. the devil's science. 


When one said that Magister N. had preached that the devil did not know what men's thoughts were, he said, "| do not believe that he preached in this way, for the Scriptures clearly show that the devil gives evil thoughts to men and blinds the minds of the wicked. And of Judah it is written Jn 13:27 that the devil put it into his heart to betray Christ. And Cain was not only given to think evil of Abel his brother and to be an enemy to him, but he also incited and drove him to murder him, Gen. 4:8. 

He does not know the thoughts of the faithful until they lead out with it; for Christ is too wise for him. As then he could not know what Christ thought in his heart; so 


708 


Nor can he know the godly thoughts in whose hearts Christ dwells. But a mighty, devious spirit is he, whom Christ himself calls "the prince of the world", John 14:30, who goes about and shoots terrible thoughts, which are his fiery arrows, also into the hearts of the godly, as there are: Unwillingness, anger, hatred against God, despair, blasphemy 2c. St. Paul understood them well in part, and also complains strongly about them, as he says 2 Cor. 12, 7: "| have been given a stake in the flesh, that is, the angel of Satan, who smites me with fists" 2c. 

These are the high spiritual temptations that no pope has understood. The crude, unskilled, untried people knew of no other temptation than the evil inclination and lust of the flesh. Therefore they interpreted the words of St. Paul: "| am given a stake in the flesh", from the disorderly love of Paul, so that he should have been inflamed against Thecla. 1) (Oh, the devil has been so hard on him that he has well forgotten the carnal immorality). Of this challenge, namely of the unchastity, the teachers in the Pabstthum, whose they also held partly for holy, have written the most, and of others little. 

Of Benedicto they write that, since he was once very challenged with unchastity, he rolled naked in briars and scratched the body well to drive away the evil desire 2c. With this and other ways, it is called haren Hemde, the body chastise with whips, remaining fasting 2c., (so that some have hurt their bodies so much that they have had to die before the time), nothing is accomplished; indeed, the devil has seen his pleasure and joy in it, laughed at the poor people and mocked them that they have toiled so hard, and thought: before this armor and brave armor | will remain well, will not be repelled by it for a long time, nor put to flight and overcome. 

Therefore, if the evil, poisonous spirit is to be resisted, this is not the way to meet it without word and heartfelt prayer, 


1) Cf. Cap. 26, § 40; § 46; § 50; Cap. 53, § 5. 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 7. 8. 


709 


as in the papacy, where they did not learn, much less experience, the benefit and power of the word and prayer; but subjected themselves to warding off the afflictions of the flesh by their own works, out of human devotion and discretion. For over this temptation, as | said, they were most troubled, which would have been well advised if God's word and order had been followed, since He says: "It is not good that man should be alone" 2c. But the devil has reversed all this, forbidding marriage through his governor, the end-Christ at Rome 2c. 

You write about a nun, Mechtilde, if | remember correctly: Since she was severely challenged with unchastity, she asked God that he would rid her of it and put on another, however great and difficult it might be. Now that she had granted her request, she was challenged for wanting to condemn God. Then murmuring and blasphemy arose in her heart against God. 2) She could bear this temptation much less than the previous one; therefore, if she could get rid of it, she would gladly suffer the previous one. 

Oh, the poor people lacked the word and right prayer. We have both, praise God, pure and abundant. But few need this armor against the devil. In a short time, after this bright light, a terrible, horrible darkness will come again. 


8. the devil's handiwork, which he does daily to damage 

people. 

(The beginning of this section is transferred to Cap. 7, § 94, where 

it belongs). 

In sum, the devil's power is greater, neither we think nor believe, because only God's finger can resist him in believers. May Christ say, Luc. 13, 11. ff., of the woman who was crooked and could not look well, since Satanas had bound her eighteen years; and Peter, Apost. 10, 38, Christ "healed all those who were overcome by the devil"; so he will also be able to bewitch a man (do not talk about spiritual bewitchment, Gal. 3, 1.), paralyze a member of his body, ruin an eye out of God's decree.

vexed and frightened, so that sometimes the whole body sweats from great fear of the heart. In addition, he leads some asleep from their beds and chambers to high and dangerous places, so that if they are not protected by the service and protection of the holy angels around them, he throws them down and they fall to their deaths. 


The devil's power and cunning are controlled by Christ alone. (Cordatus No. 1377. 1378.) 


The devil is not a doctor, but experienced, and against him no one but Jesus Christ is valid, and can make himself fine to God and says [Matth. 4, 9.]: "l will give you all these things", where he believes that Christ is his creature. But Christ calls him by his right name [Matth. 4, 10.], "Lift thyself up from me, Satan." This challenge no one understands, he will have moved Christ, especially since he spoke with words of majesty: "All these things are mine, | give them to whom | will. 

The devil gives, and God gives, but you distinguish between giver and giver. | admit, says Christ, that you are a giver, but for that reason | will not worship you. He is a mischievous spirit, who is allowed to accuse Christ of this. He will have presented him with an illusion in which he saw the whole world, and the temptation was: "One might well accept such honor and at the same time be the Son of God. 


13. to meet the devil when he holds sin against us. (This § is included in the sense of Cap. 11, § 15, para. 1.) 


If the devil plagues you and reproaches you for being a sinner, yes, say | cannot deny it. - Therefore you are mine. - Not by a long shot, for God's mercy is much greater than my sin and the sin of all bets. For this reason | do not want to heap more and more horrible sins on top of the previous ones, so that | should prove God, my Lord, false, who is merciful, and deny Christ, who gave himself for our sin. David did evil, took Uriah as his wife, and slept with her, so that 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § I I-14. 


113 


she became pregnant by him, 2 Sam. 11, 4. ff. because he could not persuade or move the pious Uriam with good words, so that he went to his house and slept with his wife 2c. But he confessed his sin and obtained forgiveness of his sin through Christ. 


14, to resist the evil spirit when it troubles our conscience because of the sins we have committed. 


When the envious, poisonous spirit, our enemy, the wicked Satan, accuses us and torments us (as he is wont to do) because of our life, evil works and sins, and gives us up as if we should belong to his kingdom for their sake, his servants and prisoners, and be eternally condemned, that he should lead us into despair, we should meet him and answer in this way: Why dost thou, thou blasphemous spirit, converse with me these things? Do you not know that Christ, my Lord, who crushed your head, forbade me not to believe you, even though you speak the truth, baptizing you and calling you "a murderer, a liar, and the father of lies," John 8:44? Nor do | confess to you that | am to be condemned by you as a prisoner, because of my sin, as a condemned man to eternal death and hellish torment and torture, who have now long been stripped of Christ, my Lord and Savior, judged, and cast out and handed over to hell with eternal bands and chains of darkness, so that you will be kept with all your companions for the judgment of the great day, and finally plunged with all the wicked into the abyss of hell. Further, by what authority dost thou presume to exercise such law and violence against me? For thou hast not given me life, nor wife, nor child, nor the least thing; neither art thou my lord, much less the maker of my body and soul; neither hast thou made me the limbs that | have sinned. How then, thou wicked false spirit, art thou so bold and foolish, that thou canst refrain from ruling over all that lam and have, with all authority, as if thou wert God? 

Also thou shalt hold before him, when he shall afflict thee, as it is said, that thou shalt speak: 


714 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 14. 15. 


715 





You have a God and Lord who says, "| am a God of the dead, that is, of afflicted, miserable sinners; but that | may make them alive, happy and righteous, as it is written in 1 Sam. 2:6: "I kill, and | make alive; | lead into hell and out again." | acknowledge Him as my God, call upon Him in all distress, praise and extol Him for all His mercy and good deeds. You are also a God, but of the living (that is, of the secure, presumptuous 2c., who do not feel their sin and damnation), that you kill them. | do not want and do not like that god, therefore troll you, you spirit of shame. 


(15) The devil must be resisted by word and prayer, otherwise nothing can be broken off from him. 


It is not enough that one who is challenged by the devil reproaches him with God's word; for the wicked, cunning spirit is so clever that he takes away one's defenses, and suddenly frightens him so much that he does not know where to start from: as he often does to me. He knows and feels that my heart prays without ceasing; nor does the evil one often reproach me, and afflict me: | do not pray. In sum, he is a swift spirit that reaches for the sword and sometimes snatches it out of one's hand when our Lord God steps behind the little door and hides himself a little. Therefore, it must always be prayed: Dear heavenly Father, help for the sake of Christ. 

No one should dare to fight with him, because he first prays with great earnestness. He is a thousandfold artist who is far too strong and powerful for us, for he is the prince and god of the world. He is also far too clever and cunning for us, and has long practiced his craft of lying, deceiving, seducing and murdering, so that we do not know the thousandth part of what he knows. In addition, he is murderously hostile to us, walks around like a roaring lion 2c., has also brought down much greater, holier, more learned people than we are; yes, whom we could not hold a candle to, as, Adam, Moses, Aaron, David, Peter 2c., that he well knows how he should come at us, because he has deceived those. 


Therefore, we should always persevere in prayer and watchfulness so that we do not fall into temptation. The false saints go safely, live without any temptations, like Judas, their father. Therefore, when their hour comes, they go, not knowing where to end. We, however, who are in the field with him, know by God's grace how to deal with the swift rogue, even though he often makes us sweat with fear. 

His greatest trickery and cunning is that he makes a law out of the gospel. If | could distinguish between the two, the law and the gospel, | would tell him to lick me every hour. Even if | had hardly sinned, | would defy him and say, "How, because | have sinned, is the gospel to be blamed or denied? Not by a long shot; grace is much more powerful than sin. 

But if he puts me to the task and burden of disputing with myself, "This you have done, that you have left undone," then he has won, and | am down, unless I, by the grace of God, take hold of myself, pick myself up, and take up the sword again, defend myself, and say: That | have done this, | have left that, | am therefore undaunted, for | believe through Christ forgiveness of sins: and that | should not doubt it, | have a sure pledge of it, for | have been baptized 2c. For this | have received the true body given for me, the blood of my dear Lord and Savior JEsu Christ, shed for me, for the remission of sins. 

But whoever persists in doing and not doing, and does not take hold of the article "forgiveness of sins", he goes there, like D. Krause 1) at Halle, who fell into temptation, because he had taken the half sacrament, which he had previously received completely, according to Christ's command, to please the bishop, then he would be lost, Christ would stand against him and accuse him 2c. But there would have been no need for him if someone had been there to comfort him in God's name: If you have done it, it is done. - But | have contradicted 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, Col. 2218 ff. Luther's letter to the Christians at Halle of Apr. 26, 1528. Dr. Krause cut off his neck in despair. Cf. Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, 1968, § 33.

Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 15-17. 


77 


my conscience, therefore | am of the devil. - Not yet,| Earnestly exhort to prayer that the dear God and 


let our doings be as they may, but God wants us to hear His dear Son, in whom He is well pleased, who says: "He who believes" 2c., no one excluded, "shall be saved", Marc. 16, 16.: "Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened", Matth. 11, 28. 

Whoever could make a strong distinction between the law and the gospel would be well advised. For they are two different words: one speaks of our doings, the other of God's grace and truth. Or, one frightens, the other comforts. Now when the devil reproaches you: You have not kept what God commanded, nor obeyed what he forbade, therefore you are mine. - Oh no. Not to me. That God is angry and punishes is true, but the obstinate and impenitent. But he is kind and gracious to those who feel their misery and desire his mercy. But his mercy is a thousand times greater than our sin. "He is angry but fora moment, and delighteth to live," Ps. 30:6. as he speaks through the prophet, Ezek. 33, 11. "As | live, | have no pleasure in the sinner's death," 2c. If | have sinned, let Christ, our mediator, who gave himself for us to redeem us, help me. 

That would be the right art to meet the devil; but it is difficult for anyone to get there, especially because the temptation lasts; as Paul himself complains about it Rom. 7:23: "| see another law in my members, which is contrary to the law in my mind, and takes me captive to the law of sins. But this is our comfort, that "God is faithful, who does not let us be tempted beyond our ability, but makes the temptation come to an end so that we can bear it," 1 Cor. 10:13. 


16. how the devils are cast out. 


We should not now, nor can we, cast out the devils with certain ceremonies and words, as the prophets, Christ and the apostles did in the past. We are to pray in the name of Christ, the church with 


Father of our dear Lord Jesus Christ may redeem the possessed man by His mercy. If such a prayer is made in faith, based on Christ's promise John 16:23: "Truly | say to you, if you ask anything of the Father," 2c., it is strong and powerful, so that the devil must leave the person; as | could tell you several examples. Otherwise we cannot cast out evil spirits, nor are we able to do so. 

But if one were called by God without means, and had faith to perform miracles, he could cast out devils that possess man in the flesh; as the prophets and apostles of old, who were called by God without means, and had a special command to cast out unclean spirits and to perform other miracles. Therefore they pushed and tore through them mightily, so that the sick were healed, who alone were overshadowed by the shadow of Peter, Apost. 5, 15. and Apost. 19, 12. Lucas writes: Since those around Paul "held his skin sweatcloth and tissues over the sick, the plagues departed from them, and the evil spirits departed from them. 

(Here a paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 24, 

§ 64.) 


17. conjurors of the devils in the papacy. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1666.) 

Those possessed by the devil under the pope were not freed by the power of the conjurers, because they did not mean it seriously. This must be done by the power of God and not by these words: "Go out, you evil spirit, and someone must put his life on it, because it does not happen without terror. So Christ felt Marc. 5, 30. Luc. 8, 46.] that a power had gone out from Him 2c. The evil spirit is cast out either by the prayer of the church, which gathers its prayer together, or by one who is strong in spirit. That he was seen to go out at a given sign is a lie to deceive several spiritually. Paul calls [2 Thess. 2, 9.] such things: False miracles, as that the evil spirits would be driven out by the sound of the bell of St. Cyriac. 


118 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 17-20. 


119 





1) So it happened in St. Cyriac's church, in the monastery at Weimelburg, not far from Eisleben, where there was a great pilgrimage and crowd, that a monk, a good drinking brother, commanded a possessed man that he should open his mouth, let him put two fingers in it, and yet not bite him; this happened. He also commanded the devil that he should go out when one would ring St. Cyriac's 2) little bell; this the prankster also did, so that he strengthened the poor people in the delusion and error that the little bell would be so holy that the devil would have to go out to his sound, and thus even destroy the faith in Christ. 


18 There were many possessed people in the time of Christ. (Cordatus No. 1667.) 


At the time of Christ, everything was full of Sadducees, Pharisees, Epicureans [fleshly-minded people], Peripatetics [philosophers, reasoners]. That is why there were also many who were possessed by the devil. And there are many even now, but they are called madmen, fools 2c. And no one is reckoned possessed unless he is evidently afflicted with the devil. In our time he is not cast out so soon, because he does not pretend now [as if he were cast out]. 


19. the devil cannot be cast out now, when the gospel is being taught, as he was before in the papacy, because his mischievousness 

and cunning is known to us that he cannot deceive us. 


Now | think that there are as many possessed people now as in the time of Christ; only those who are physically plagued and tormented by the devil should be counted as _ possessed, not the moonstruck, fools, senseless 2c. But in our time, when the light of the gospel shines, the evil one cannot be cast out as he did in the papacy, when he acted as if he were executing when he was summoned, because he cannot ape and beguile us as he did before this time. 


1) This paragraph will probably be spurious, an extension of the last preceding words. 2) Corrected by us from "Ciliax" according to the preceding. 





Time. Yes, he proves his supreme power and cunning at the last time, does not play and deceive, as formerly in the papacy, as can be seen in the people, who visibly become more and more angry every day, and yet want to be Christians, to know much about the gospel 2c. On the other hand, Christ is weak, allows the wicked to continue in their pretensions, and, as it seems, does not take care of his small flock 2c. From this | assume and conclude that the blessed appearance and future of our dear Lord Christ must not be far away, when he will again show and prove his divine power against the devil and his scales. He will now let him be drilled until his hour. 

The mischievous one has sharpened the knife on the arch-fathers, before and after the flood; item, on the prophets, Christ, the apostles, and their disciples. We are the last and weakest group, even the yeast compared to them, and therefore can hardly hold a candle to them. For nowhere has there been such certain knowledge, firm faith, high enlightenment, great wisdom, holiness, steadfastness and power to resist the devil and to despise the disgrace and wrath of the wicked and condemned world as in them. But | hope that in and through us, who are the weakest of all, Christ will overcome the most powerful, poisonous and fierce enemy, amen. 


20) Whether the devil knew Christ according to the flesh. 


When one asked if the devil knew Christ according to the flesh, M. M. answered: Yes, he knows the scripture: "Behold, a virgin is with child", Is. 7, 14. Item: "A child is born to us" 2c., Is. 9, 6. and hear that we sing daily: Verbum cara factum est. Item: Et incarnatus est de Spiritu sancto, et Homo factus est. But because Christ held himself so low, dealing with public sinners and sinners 2c., and therefore had no reputation, he looked above and knew him not. For the devil is clear-sighted, he only looks at what is great and high, there he attaches himself; below himself, and what is lowly, he does not look at. 


720 


But the eternal, merciful God turns around and looks at what is lowly, as the 113th Psalm, v. 6, sings: "Our God looks at what is lowly"; and Is. 66, 2: "I look at the wretched, and the broken in spirit, and who fears my word. But what is high he lets go, yes, it is an abomination before him, as Christ Luc. 16, 15. says: "What is high among men is an abomination before God." Therefore let him who desires to go high take heed of the devil, lest he overthrow him: for his way is first to lead into heaven, and after that to cast him into the abyss of hell. 


Do not invite the devil as a guest. 


(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Oct. 7, 1538. S. 142.) 


That day Luther was hunting, where a hare and a fox were seen by everyone. When Erasmus Spiegel pursued him on horseback, the horse suddenly fell and died. This hare was a devil's ghost; as they told a story right after that, that many noblemen would have ridden in the bet and would have said: The last of the devil. But a boy, who had two horses, left the one behind, which was led away by the devil into the air. Luther answered: One should not invite the devil as a guest. We have enough to do against him with prayer and vigilance. 

‘) In 1546, Martin Luther in Eisleben was told over the table that noblemen in the land of Thuringia had once frightened hares at night on Herselberg and caught them at eight. When they came home and hung up the rabbits, in the morning they had been the heads of horses, which otherwise lay on the shingles. 


22) How blasphemy and presumption are punished. 


Doctor Luther said in Eisleben: That once good fellows had sat together in a coal mine. Now there had been a wild, wild child among them, who had said: If

ml 


If someone were to give him a good draught of wine, he would sell him his soul for it. Not long after that, someone came to him in the parlor, sat down with him and drank with him. He said to the man who had been so presumptuous, "Listen, you said before that if someone gave you a bottle of wine, you would sell him your soul for it. Then he said again, "Yes, | will do it; let me feast today and be in good spirits. The man (who was the devil) said yes, and soon after that he left him again. When the same gourmand had been merry all day, and at last was drunk, the former man (the devil) came again and sat down by him, and asked the other revelers, saying, "Gentlemen, what do you think, when a man chews a horse, does not the saddle and bridle belong to him also? They were all frightened. But finally the man said, "Well, tell it quickly. Then they confessed and said, "Yes, the saddle and bridle also belong to him. Then the devil took the same wild, rough fellow and led him through the ceiling, so that no one knew where he had gone. 

At another time, Doctor Luther told this story of presumption and blasphemy, and said: Once a man of war had been appointed in the Mark, but he had been wronged and violated. He had given money to his host, and when he demanded it from him again, the host denied it and said: He had received nothing from him. When the lansquenet disagreed with the landlord about the money and stormed the house, the landlord came and had the lansquenet arrested; he wanted to deceive the lansquenet into keeping the money and sued the lansquenet to the hilt, to the neck and to the stomach, as if he had broken the peace of his house. -Then the devil came to the farmhand in prison and said to him, "Tomorrow you will be brought before the court and your head will be cut off because you have broken the peace of the house. If you want to be mine, body and soul, | will help you. But the lansquenet would not do it. Then

If he comes among the jurists, he causes misfortune, disagreement, makes injustice out of right, and right out of injustice. If he comes among great potentates, emperors, kings, princes 2c., he causes war and bloodshed. If he comes among the theologians, he again causes such misfortune that no human wit can help: deprive people of property and honor, body and soul, with false doctrine. But it is God alone who can calm and control him with his word, even though it takes great effort.

41 Historia, wie ein Poltergeist einen Pfarrherr geplaget habe, und D. Luther's advice on how to drive him out. 


(Lauterbach, Apr. 5, 1538, p. 55.) 


On April 5, the pastor of the church at Subtitz, near Torgau, came and complained about ghosts and disturbances of the devil, who bothered him by nightly noise and real breaking of all household utensils, throwing his pots and bowls close to his head, so that they burst into pieces. 1) And apparently he torments him by laughing at him, but he sees nothing, and many other things he has done for a whole year, so that even his wife and children want to leave. Luther answered: My brother, be strong in the Lord and sure in faith, do not give way to that robber and suffer the outward and small harm by breaking the pots, for he cannot harm you in soul and body, as you have experienced, for the angel of the Lord is with you. Let him play with pots. You pray with your children and the woman to GOD: Troll yourself, Satan, | am master in this house and you are not. | am the father of the house here by divine power, and the pastor of the church by heavenly calling; | have the testimony from heaven and from earth.

Faith overcomes the devil. 


The devil is a spirit and founder of presumption, and is not driven out by an unbelieving, wild or crude Christian, but faith overcomes him. Luther told this example: There was a doctor of medicine who had seen a child being baptized in church, and had heard the words of baptism spoken with diligence, and from this he had gained a strong faith, so that he had said with great joy: "If | knew that | had been baptized with these words, just as this child, | would no longer fear the devil. When the child's parents and others, who were otherwise concerned about the baptism, said that he had also been baptized in the same way, and that these words had also been spoken about his baptism, the doctor gained even more courage and spirit, so that he did not want to fear the devil or any misfortune. Now it happened that the devil appeared to the doctor in the form of a shaggy goat with long horns and let himself be seen on the wall. The doctor realized that it was the devil and took heart, caught the goat by the horns and tore it from the wall, hit the goat on the table, kept the horns in his hand, and the body disappeared. 

Another one sees this and thinks: "If the doctor has done this, | will do the same, since | am baptized as well as he is. When the devil met him in the form of a goat. When the devil met him in the form of a goat, he also wanted to perform this miracle and drove out of the goat. 


728 Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 42-44. 29 


The devil twisted his neck and strangled him. This is what happens to a man who wants to be a monkey and, out of certainty and presumption, imitates the examples that only faith is entitled to and that no one else can imitate. 


43. poltergeists, so D. Luthern have plagued at Wartburg in his Patmo. (The first paragraph at Cordatus No. 1125.) 


The devil often tormented me with his haunting, especially in the castle where | was a prisoner for a while. There he took the walnuts from the table and hurled them to the ceiling all night long. 1) 

In 1546, when Luther was in Eisleben, he told the following story about how the devil had plagued him in Wartburg, and said: "When | left Worms in 1521 and was captured near Eisenach, and was sitting in the Patmo in Wartburg Castle, | was far away from people in a room and no one could come to me, except two noble boys, who brought me food and drink twice a day. Now they had bought me a sack of hazelnuts, which | ate at times, and had locked the same in a box. When | went to bed at night, | undressed in the parlor, turned off the light and went into the room, lay down in bed: there it comes over the hazelnuts, lifts, 


and had smelled that | was in the castle, would have liked to see me, but it could not be. So they took me to another room and put the same Frau von Berlibs in my chamber. There was such a rumbling in the chamber during the night that she would have thought there were a thousand devils inside. But the best way to drive him away is to call on Christ and despise the devil; he cannot stand that. One must say to him: If you are a lord over Christ, so be it. For so | also said to Eisenach. 


44. The devil can be driven away with contempt and ridiculous antics. 


Doctor Luther said: If he had not been able to get rid of the devil with the Holy Scriptures and with serious words, he would often have driven him away with pointed words and ridiculous antics. And if he had wanted to weigh down his conscience, he would often have said to him: 3) Devil, | have also pissed in my pants, have you also smelled it and written it in your register with the other sins of mine? Item, he would have said to him: "Dear devil, if the blood of Christ, shed for my sins, is not enough, | beg you to ask God for me. When | am idle, and have nothing to do, the devil creeps in to me, and before | look around, he

Then said he, saith God of Job unto Satan, Cap. 2, 6: "Behold, 


It is almost ridiculous that God has placed us, who are flesh and blood, in mutual war and battle with such a strong and great spirit as the devil is, and that He has given us no other weapons in our hands against such a great power than here and there a word of Scripture, which we are to take hold of in faith, and its so great evils-. 


1) In this section, Luther leaves the question undiscussed, in contrast to Aurifaber's account in the following paragraph. 


2) Cf. cap. 25, § 2. 


734 


The Word is supposed to defeat the deeds. This must certainly annoy the great spirit from the heart. But in this battle it is especially difficult to recognize the devil as the devil. For no one can attain with words how manifoldly that accursed majesty transforms itself. But if one knows Satan, that it is Satan, one can easily disgrace his pride by saying: Lick me in Ars, or: Shit in the pants [bruch] and hang it on the neck. 1) 


The devil condemns us, since he is worse than we are. (Contained in Cap. 24, § 5.) 


The devil is a formidable, fierce enemy. 


The devil is not a small, bad, but a mighty, great, fierce and swift enemy, who neither rests nor celebrates day or night, cannot be chased away with outward and bodily weapons; for he has Goliath's spear, with which he approaches and wants to stab us. For this purpose God arms him, sharpens his weapons, gives him a sting to his shaft, namely the law of God, with which he stings us and attacks us mightily. But God arms him for this reason, so that when he is overcome and defeated by the godly through faith, it will hurt him the more and he will be put to shame. The fact that a strong man is overcome by a weak man hurts him in his heart and makes him very angry. 


58. How the devil challenges the right devout Christians. (Cordatus No. 1418.) 


The devil contests with impetuosity, with frequent repetition, with persistence. 2) 

The devil attacks the godly and pious Christians in two ways: either he invades them by force, whether he wants to

If he is not able to do so, he will continue the challenge forever and will not let up, so that he will make them tired and checkmate them. As Cyprian writes of some martyrs, that they would gladly have died, but one would not kill them and put them to death. 


The devil is like a birdcage. (Cordatus No. 1641. 1642. 1643 and 1366.) 


3) The devil is like a birdcatcher who snaps the necks of all birds he catches. He would undoubtedly do this to all people if God did not defend him with his angels. He keeps few who entice and sing his songs, who must be his prisoners. | do not hope that he will put me in a pawn. He who wants to be safe from him needs the armor of the word. 

Whoever is sure, or indulges in his thoughts, the devil is very close to him, and he is defeated only by the word and prayer; he does not confess to this umbrella stroke 4). 

As the devil is in hell, and Duke George in Dresden, so he dwells in the hearts of the wicked, working on them and hardening them, and if he had no greater power than to torment our bodies and damage our possessions, he would not yet be a devil, having business only in earthly but not in heavenly things. 

The greatest art and the main dispute of the devil is that he nullifies with words the article of the forgiveness of sins in a negative and positive way [privative et positive], such as: You preached the gospel (who commanded it?) in a different way than it has ever been preached. Then he exaggerates our sins and belittles the good, or even slander. Then one must be sure, and so much so, that he can boast with Paul that he is a teacher of the Gentiles, a servant of God 2c. This glory is as necessary as an article of faith.

60: The devil's tricks and nature. 1) (Cordatus No. 657.) 


Christ describes in the most real way the wickedness of the devil Joh. 8, [44.] by saying: "You are of the father, the devil" 2c. From this it follows that all his wickedness starts from the lie [as he deceived Adam and Eve], 2) and after they were caught by the lie, he brought them to death. So he did soon after with the two brothers 2c. So his regiment goes: where he comes, there he challenges with lies, deceives the people. Afterwards he does not rest, he also commits murder and sedition through disobedience. Third, when he has brought men to that point, he drives some to despair and to inflict death on themselves, as he did Judas, whom he first deceived with lies. Then he caused him to become a traitor and a murderer of his own master. After that, he led him into despair and that he himself was saved. Thus he finally rewarded his servants. Our Savior, Christ, the greatest teacher of truth, behaves in the opposite way, for he has this testimony from the Father. Matth. 17, [5.] 


The devil despises and ridicules all the works of God. 


The devil has heard and vexed people in various ways, sometimes saying that the consecrated water burns him. Soon after, he said that he was not afraid of the consecrated water anywhere, because one had sprinkled it on himself in the morning, who had slept with his wife. So he despises marriage with such superstition and superstition. As a possessed man the sacrament of the altar,

of the true body of Christ, he said, "A prankster can sit under the stairs and let a pious man pass by. 

Two miles away from H. there was a great pilgrimage to the golden Lupa: for those who were not canonized, and were not raised by the pope, or by his order by the bishops, were called blessed, but not saints; after that it was revealed that a churchman had buried his dog, called Lupa, there. 


62. from a fortune teller. 


In Efrfurt] 3) a soothsayer and black artist was burned, who had been walking sadly and sorrowfully for several years, because he was very poor and had neither bite nor bread. Once the devil met him in a visible form and promised him great things, that he would become rich if he denied baptism and salvation through Christ and would never repent. The poor man accepted this; then the devil gave him a crystal from which he could tell fortunes; through this he got a great name and a great influx, so that he became rich. Finally, the devil deceived him honestly and made him look at his butt, so that he accused some innocent people from the crystal of thievery. This caused him to be put in prison, and afterwards he confessed that he had broken the covenant made with the devil, asked that a preacher be sent to him, repented righteously, and with his example brought many people to the fear of God, and died with a happy heart in his corporal punishment. Thus, the devil has been disgraced in his own art, and revealed in his evil plots and wiles.

738 Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 64-67. 739 


64. Satan possesses people in two ways. 


People are possessed by the devil in two ways: 1) some physically, according to the outward man and appearance; some spiritually, according to the spirit and soul, as all the wicked are possessed. In the insane, the frenzied, and those who are only physically possessed, the devil has only taken the body and plagues it, not the spirit or soul, therefore the latter remains unchanged and unharmed. From the same, then, the devils can be cast out with prayer and fasting. But the ungodly and blasphemers are spiritually possessed, they cannot be helped nor delivered from them; indeed, Christ could not cast out devils from Hannah, Caipha, and other ungodly Jews. Therefore it is much greater and more terrible, even more dangerous, to be spiritually possessed than to be physically possessed by the devil, although the world does not respect it, nor does it consider it so. 


The shape and form the devil takes. 


The devil has two forms and shapes or larvae in which he disguises himself: either he disguises himself as a snake, to frighten and kill; or as a sheep, because he puts on sheepskins, to lie and deceive. These are his two court colors. 


66) In which animals the devil hides and leads himself the most. 


The snakes and monkeys are subject to the devil above all other animals, into which he leads and possesses them; uses them to deceive and harm people. 


How to overcome the devil with contempt, in faith, not in presumption. (Lauterbach, Apr. 19, 1538, p. 64 f.) 


That evening Magister Simon  [Sulcer], Superintendent of the Swiss in Bern, was there, ate with Luther, conversed with him in the most intimate manner, and expressed good hope about Switzerland. For Bucer was working beyond his strength 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, 1024, § 7. 


and aged very much. Afterwards, he spoke of his colleague in Bern, a very learned man, how he probably smelled of unity, and told a story about this colleague: namely, that he had admonished a woman, who had long been tormented by Satan's rumblings, that she should despise him and say: Leave me alone and come to Constenius. When the woman had done this and said that Satan should visit Constenius, Satan went from there to Constenius at an hour's notice and plagued him for a whole year with all kinds of noise. Luther answered: Satan can be overcome by contempt, but in faith, not in presumption. Nevertheless, one should not invite him as a guest; for he is a strong enemy, for he sees and hears everything that is before us, what we now speak, and out of admission to God he corrupts everything that is good. He would that not one little grass or leaf should grow. That is Satan's power. Nevertheless, he cannot search our hearts, conscience and faith; he has a certain God-likeness, but God has reserved the true Godhead for himself. He can resist the devil. Therefore Christ says (Joh. 16, 33.): "Be of good cheer, | have overcome the world", i.e. the whole devil. Therefore we pray, "Deliver us from evil." [ovnpdv [evil] is manifold: all misfortunes, miseries, sins, aversions. In short, there is no cessation. Against this evil we pray from day to day, and are heard, as we see, when it is prevented, and we who believe judge the evil angels, 1 Cor. (6, 3.), although he creeps in again and again, for he does not like to be brought out of what he has been granted [praescriptum]. But the devil is a foolish spirit, because he himself gives opportunity to Christ; by tormenting the weak, he strengthens the reputation of Christ and the apostles who raise the mats. Rather, the devil should be silent, but the extreme desire to harm drives him to make himself manifest as well. 

Then he spoke of the great miracles of the apostles and the course of their preaching, which were more glorious than those of Christ's own person. For Peter, by one sermon, won three thousand, which is the same as that of Christ. 


740 Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 67-72. 741 


does not read. Therefore Christ says Matth. 11, (II.): "But he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." But Christ performs the most glorious miracles in His very weak kingdom. 


68. the punishment of the wicked when they are handed over to Satan and become the devil's apartments. (Lauterbach, April 19, 1538, p. 65.) 


After that, Satan and his power, who opposes God and all his creatures through his pride, were remembered once again. That is why the church did not hand over the godless and impenitent to anyone but Satan for chastisement, who killed them with God's permission or at least struck them with various misfortunes. Thus, even now in many regions are dwellings of evil spirits. Prussia is full of demons, Lapland full of witches. In Switzerland, near Lucerne, ona very high mountain, there is a lake called Pilate's Pond, where the devil rages. And Luther said that in his homeland there is a lake on a very high mountain, Pubelsberg, and if it were moved by a stone thrown into it, a great storm would arise over the whole region. These are dwellings of evil spirits that are imprisoned. 


Whether the devil knows the thoughts of men? 


St. Augustine writes about someone who was able to say what was in his mind, as if someone thought of a verse from Virgilio. But the devil had given him the verse beforehand, as he knows the thoughts of the wicked, what they have in their hearts. For he rides and drives them, works in them what he wills and for what he wills, according to all his pleasure: even as the Holy Spirit is in the godly, and drives them to all good. 

But what God works in the heart, and the Holy Spirit does in man, he cannot know, nor see. There he is even excluded, like a servant from his master's bedchamber. Thus, Satan did not know that the Holy Spirit was the Virgin Mary. 


Nor did he hear the angels singing to the shepherds on the night Christ was born, nor Zachariah's and Simeon's praise and blessing, nor all that was said over the tables in the supper when Christ washed the disciples' feet. He did not see the transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor, for the angels drove him away; otherwise he would have known that he, Christ, was the true Messiah. Even though he sometimes said that he knew that Jesus was the Christ, because he is a lying spirit, one should not believe his words, since he says that he knows. 


70. of conjurers of the devil. 


| once heard of an exorcist and conjurer, said D. Martin said that when he had summoned the devil to show him what had been lost, the devil would have shown him the city, but when he asked him in which house it was, the devil would have said, "| cannot see it, for a thick fog has rolled over it. 

But God and Christ see what the devil does, what he and those he drives have in mind. Likewise, the devil cannot see what the saints, the Holy Spirit and Christ do and think. Therefore this argument does not conclude: Christ saw the hearts and minds of the Pharisees, and is God: but the devil also sees them; therefore 2c.; for the devil had given them their thoughts. But it concludes correctly: Christ sees into the heart of the devil and his members what they think, which the devil cannot do; therefore Christ is right, natural, true God.

After that, it was said of three servants whom the devil carried away bodily at SiBen, near Augsburg, on Char Friday (April 19) this year, who had surrendered to Satan. Luther answered: This is the punishment of sin. How one does it, one has the reward. 


Whoever serves the devil, he also rewards him. (Lauterbach, Sept. 12, 1538, p. 129.) 


On September 12 they spoke about the deception of the devil, the murderer. Then D. Martinus said that the son-in-law of the barber Peter had been an invulnerable man of war. Finally he foresaw his death and said: My father-in-law shall do it. Furthermore: | will be stabbed at the table. Also on this very day Dieterich (that was his name) is said to have said to his wife: Buy, you will have guests today, spectators. So the devil paid him?) 


75. deuce of nobility history. (Lauterbach, Sept. 12, 1538, p. 129 f.) 


After that, Brick told a similar example, how two noblemen, who were very hostile to each other, had been at the court of the emperor, that one had sworn to strangle the other, if he overcame him. One night the devil killed one of them with the other's sword, which he then put back into the scabbard by the bed, and while this was happening the other was lying ina very heavy dream and believed that he had killed the other. Also his horse in the stable was as it were excited and stood there in the highest fear, full of sweat. He was found dead in bed early in the morning, and because of their enmity, the suspicion of many fell on the other, and his bloody sword was found. And yet he did not do it, but Satan. This nobleman was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but with the explanation: If one 


1) Cf. on this history Walch, old edition, vol. IX, 1421 ff. 


If you bring him to the square, you should push away the earth of his shadow and banish [him] from the area. This is called civil death. Because he wanted to kill the other, and it was done by the devil, he is guilty. And he decided: So it is with these who make a temporary alliance with the devil, who keeps his own warm for a time and flatters them. But in the end he pays them honestly. 

2) That evening, people in Lochau were happy. Luther said: "Oh, how | would like to be with the Lord Christ one evening when he has been happy for once; otherwise he has been sad enough. 


The miraculous conflict and victory of the Christians with the devil. 


Doctor Martinus commanded the people to listen diligently to the divine word and to pray, because we have to fight, not against the pope, but against the devil, whom Christ has overcome. We poor, weak people have to stand against such a mighty spirit, that we have to fight with him and win against him. It is truly a wonderful victory. As if one should quench a great fire, blaze and fire with a spoonful of water, or with a cupful of water; or if one poor little sheep should chase away many ravening wolves and fierce lions. For a certain devil is stronger and wiser than all men, than he who knows us by heart and inwardly, and to reckon against him we are alphabet pupils, weak and poor sinners; as we learn by experience. 

Therefore, these are the works of God, that we poor people with our weakness do more in Christ than all emperors, kings, popes, princes, disciples, doctors. For in the utmost and highest foolishness we are the most wise, in the greatest weakness the strongest, in the greatest injustice the most holy, in the greatest anger the most pleasant and dearest. 

That is why this victory is far above all ver- 


2) Transferred here from Cap. 7, § 44. 


744 


The truth of the matter is not in the hands of human reason, and yet it is grasped and understood with closed eyes through faith. And if God had not given us the dear holy angels as guardians and protectors, who encamp around us like a chariot, Ps. 34:8, we would soon be finished. As we see in Job, when Satan, as a slanderer, accuses him and says, "Yes, dear one, Job is good to be good, bad and righteous, for you have heaped a wall around him; but since you will stretch out your hand and allow me to attack him, it will be seen how good he is," Job 1:9 ff. Cap. 2, 4. 5. Then God permitted him, saying, Cap. 2, 6. "Behold, he is in your hand," attack him in his body and afflict him as you will, "but spare his life," and do not kill him. Then the devil went out and afflicted poor Job with so much evil French that there was not a whole spot on his skin, from the sole of his foot to the top of his head, that he sat down in ashes, and harmed himself with broken pieces, Cap. 2, 7. 8. Then also the curses began, so that Job blasphemed the day on which he was born, Cap. 3, 1. ff. And this is the sum and the whole content of the book of Job: If God does not preserve us, and as it were heaps a wall around us, then Satan has soon overthrown us and devoured us. Therefore this victory stands only in faith, that we always live in the fear of God, be courageous and call upon God with earnestness: "For it is no joke here, it is your honor and property, body and soul. Therefore, if thou art a sinner (as we all are without ceasing), believe; and thou shalt be justified. If thou art weak, believe; and thou shalt be strong. If thou art foolish, believe; and thou shalt be wise.

745 


Devil's work. In the past, the papists, being superstitious people, said that such people should not be baptized properly, some drunken priest. 


79 Some Histories Narrated by D. M. Luther. The first: Of a piper whom the devil led away. 


At Mélburg, 1) in the country of Thuringia, not far from Erfurt, there was a piper who let himself be used as a minstrel at weddings. He complained to the priest there how he was being challenged by the devil every day, and the latter 2) had threatened him, he wanted to lead him away, because he had drunk from a woodpecker and a long glass, in which wine and horse manure had been put by some young journeymen, out of malice; he would have been heartily sorry for that. Then the priest comforted him, prayed for him, prepared and instructed him with many sayings from the holy scriptures against the devil. From this he learned so much that he did not doubt the salvation of his soul and said, "The devil will not harm the soul, but he will take away my body, and no one can prevent him from doing so. 

But the devil showed him when he would come and take him. Then they appointed guards to watch over him in the chamber where he was, praying with him and reading from God's word, and some were appointed outside with their armor and weapons. This lasted and was delayed for several days, so that they waited for him. On Saturday at midnight, the guards and some others were sitting with him with lights, when a storm wind came and blew out all the lights, took him, and led him out to the parlor, which was locked, through a small narrow window out into the street. There was a great clatter and commotion, as if many armored people were beating each other. So he got away and was lost, so that no one knew where to go. 

In the morning they searched for him back and forth, 


1) Miihlberg, near the three Gleichen. 2) "this" added by us. 


746 


Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 79-81.

and finally found him lying crosswise, with his arms outstretched, in a small booklet or body of water that flows down from Gleichen to Mélburg, dead and coal- black. This story has certainly happened, said D. Martin, as Mr. Friedrich Mecum, pastor at Gotha, told me, and he heard it from Mr. Johann Beck, then pastor at Mélburg. 


The other story: How the devil can frighten the conscience and harm the body of man. 


D. M. Luther said in 1543 that it had happened recently, sixteen or seventeen years ago, in Eisenach, that there had been a piper there who had been tempted by the devil, as if he wanted to lead him away, for the sake of the cause, that he had whistled to a wedding, where one had been given a bride who was not his, but had been betrothed to another. Justus Menius and many fine priests were with him, who comforted him with sayings from the holy scriptures, gave him the sacrament and absolved him, stayed with him day and night, and guarded the door and windows so that he would not be led away. Finally he said, "Well, he can't harm my soul, but he will take the body away at eight o'clock today. So the guards were ordered and everything was kept safe. But the devil came and knocked two or three tiles out of the oven and took him away. In the morning they searched all the streets for him, but not far from the city, in a hazel tree, he was found dead. 

That is what conscientia does. Oh, | would like to tell the lawyers. He would gladly have harmed the poor man's soul, but when the man Christ is held up to him, whom he has crucified, he is ashamed of it. Therefore, if you say, "I believe in Jesus Christ, | have been baptized, | have received the body and blood of Christ in the Lord's Supper,” and say this from your heart, he cannot harm you. What he did to the body, he also did to the Son of God, whom he crucified and martyred to death. But if he has not won the soul, it is well. 





The third: About a nobleman who was served by the devil. 


A nobleman, not far from Torgau, went for a walk. He met someone and asked him if he wanted to serve him, because he needed a servant. He answered: Yes, he wanted to serve him. The nobleman asked him what his name was. He said, "In Bohemian he would be called N. N.". Well, said the nobleman, go home with me; and led him into the stable, and directed him the horses, which he should maintain. 

But the nobleman was a godless man, who nourished himself from the ripe, so that he would have a good servant. Once the nobleman rode away, and ordered him a horse, which was very dear to him, that he should wait for it diligently. When the nobleman had ridden away, the servant led the horse to a high tower, higher than ten steps. When the nobleman came back to his house, the horse knew him, started to scream, and stuck his head out of the window at the top of the tower. He was very surprised, and as soon as he came home, he asked where the horse had gone. Then the servant said: He had diligently carried out his master's order, and showed him where the horse was. After that, the horse had to be brought down from the tower with great effort and work, with ropes and cords. 

About this it happened that when he, the nobleman, was on the booty, those he had robbed hurried after him. Then the servant said, "Squire, flee quickly and get off the horse. Soon after, he came to him again and said, "He had taken all the horseshoes from their horses so that they could not have gotten away," and he rang the bell with the sack in which the horseshoes were and poured them out. 

At another time, when the nobleman was imprisoned because of a death blow, he called the servant for help. He said that he could not help him because he was wearing strong oak pants tied with iron laces. But when the nobleman stopped and said that he could help him, the servant let himself be persuaded and said: | will help you, but you do not have to flap your hands much and make umbrella strokes, for | will help you. 


748

749 





can't stand it (cried, making a cross in front of himself). The nobleman said: He should take him anyway, he wanted to stay inside. So he took him, and led him up into the air with the chains and fetters. And because the nobleman was afraid on high, he cried out loudly: Help God, where am |? Then he let him fall down into a pool, came home, and showed it to the women, saying that she should send for him. Since she did not want to believe it, he said: Why she did not want to release her squire, he would be trapped there in a deep pool in the stick. Then the woman ran there with her servants, found him lying there, and set him free. 


The fourth: From one of nobility. 


A nobleman went to a sick peasant, who was possessed, and, as some are foolish, he said: You devil, why do you plague the poor man so miserably? And asked him why he did not rather attack and torment the great Hansen at court? He said to the devil, "Leave the poor man alone. Then the devil answered, "He would gladly do it, if only he would enter him," and asked him if he would allow him to do it. But he said, "Certainly not. Then the devil asked him if he would allow him to live in the tail of his robe, if he would not harm him, and if he would be lucky and victorious in all knightly games and exercises. So the nobleman allowed him to do so, and he won all the knightly games, races and jousting, and did the best. All in all, he was always on top and received the best jewel and the greatest honor. 

Finally, however, the nobleman said: "I also think about how it will be after this life, | don't like this life anymore; therefore, | am on leave. Go away, | do not want you with me any longer. And he went from the court to a hospital, and served poor people there 2c. 


83 The fifth: Of a monk and a devil. 


Once a monk was traveling overland. There came to him one who was well armed and carried a crossbow or a steel bow. Then the monk was happy that he hada 





The monk had received a journeyman, because the way was uncertain. When they had gone part of the way, the monk spoke to the journeyman and asked him if they were going right? he said: No. When the monk saw that [it] was an unknown way, he began to be afraid. But the companion turned to him and said: "Monk, give me the cap. As he said this, it seemed to him that someone was pulling off his cap like a wind, and with great fear he ran as fast as he could toward the next village, half dead. After that, when he came back to himself, he told how it had gone. 


The sixth: Of two monks. 


A cardinal went with another brother across the field, and when they came to the inn, the innkeeper said: They should be dear guests to him, he would now have luck. For he had an evil spirit in one chamber, so that no one could sleep in it; but the guests who were laid up in it were not beaten, but only vexed. And he said that he would have a good bed made up for the holy fathers inside, because they were holy people who could conjure up the devil. At night, when they had lain down and wanted to sleep, the spirit kept on scuffling one after the other at the little wreath on the plate. Then the monks began to quarrel with each other, and one said to the other: Dear, don't call me, let's sleep now. Then the devil came again and twitched the guardian by the little wreath. The guardian said, "Go in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and come to us in the monastery. When he had said this, they fell asleep and had rest. When they returned to the monastery, the devil sat on the threshold of the gate and cried out, "Beneveneritis, Guardian. But they were sure, because they thought he was now in their power and hand, and asked him what he wanted? He answered, "He wants to serve them in the monastery," and asked that he be ordered to a place where they could find him in need of service. They directed him to a corner in the kitchen. And so that they could know him, they dressed him in a 


750Cap . 24 Of the devil and his works. § 84-88. 751 


He put on a monk's cap and tied a bell to it as a signto be like God. He is a very fiercely proud spirit, cannot that he was being recognized. Then they called to himstand that one wants to despise him. So | also ordered, to fetch some beer. Then they heard the bell, and hesaid D. Martin, that they should write to the priest said, "Give me good money, and | will bring you good again, so that they should certainly believe it to be no 


beer. 

So it became known throughout the city. When he came to a cellar where he had not been well measured, he said: "Give me a full measure and good beer, | have given you good money. It was considerable, and had a great appearance. The papists thought that it was good spirits, as Diana, and other many such idols and abominations, which the pagans honored as gods. 

And because the ghost, as | said, or the little devil (as our people call him) lived in a corner of the kitchen, the kitchen boy was a mischievous one, and poured in dishwater and other filth, hot broth, and such unclean things, which remained and were not fit, in corners. The little devil begged him and warned him to stop, and not to cause him any more trouble, but he would not let up nor stop. Then the devil got angry and hung the kitchen boy over a beam in the kitchen, but it did not harm his life. Then the guardian gave him a vacation. 


85. wonderful story of the devil who deceived and strangled people. 


A priest, M. Georg Rérern, wrote to Wittenberg: As a woman had died in a village, and now, because she was buried, she ate herself in the grave, so almost all the people in the same village had died: and asked him to ask D. Martin what he advised about it. He said, "This is the devil's deceit and wickedness: if they did not believe it, it did them no harm, and they certainly thought it was nothing but the devil's ghost. But because they were so superstitious, they would only die more and more. And if one knew such things, one should not throw the people into the grave so unjustly, but say: "Eat, devil, you have salts, you do not deceive us. And said D. M. Luther continued: "The devil, in short, wants to be feared, honored and worshipped. 


ghost or soul, but the devil himself. Therefore, they should go to church together and ask God to forgive their sin for the sake of Christ and to ward off the devil.

87) Over which, and how far, God forbids the devil to afflict the people. 


God gives power to the devil and sorcerers over people in two ways. First, over the wicked, when he wants to punish them for their sin. Secondly, over the pious and God-fearing, when he wants to try them whether they want to remain steadfast in faith and in his obedience. For without God's will and our consent, the devil cannot harm us. For thus he says: "Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye," Zech. 2, 8. And Christ says: "Without the will of your heavenly Father, not a hair of your head can fall off," Luc. 21, 18. 


88. a marvelous story of a virgin, how the devil played a game with her. 


There were two students in Erfurt, one of whom was so fond of a virgin that he almost went mad over it. Then the other one, of whom he did not know that he was a black artist, said: "Will 


752 Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 88-92. 753 


If you do not take her in your arms, | will make her come to you. When he agreed, he brought it about with his swan-like art that the virgin came to him. And when she went into his parlor, as he was a very beautiful man, he received her so kindly and talked to her that the black artist was always worried that he would love her. And since the student could not refrain from great love, he embraced her. Then she fell down and died. Now that she lay dead, they were very frightened. The black artist said, "Now we must try the worst; and he made the devil carry her home again, and did what she had done before in the house. But she was very pale and spoke nothing. After three days, the parents went to the theologians and asked them for advice on what to do with her. When they spoke harshly to her, the devil left her and fled, and the dead body fell straight down with a great stench. For the blood is a cause of good color, and the living spirits, these the devil cannot make, but God alone is the Creator. 


How to use the history of the devil's tyranny. 


Some years ago in the land of Thuringia, the devil wanted to take away a young journeyman, but he resisted and argued with him for a long time, so that the devil had to give way. -Then he repented and reformed, and was preserved. 

These are truly not useless and futile histories and stories to make people fearful: they are truly terrible, and not at all children's work, as the clever think. Therefore, take good note of such histories and the like, that you may be more modest, chaste and diligent, and beware of cursing and blasphemy, and do not invite the devil as your guest: he is much nearer to us than we think. And at the same time remember this saying: "The Son of God has appeared to destroy the works of the devil," 1 John 3:8. 

Well, may our Lord God help us, not only because the course of the heavens and the 


Star, together with many cruel and terrifying 


The church is not only a sign of no good, but also a sign of the devil's cunning, trickery, and practices, who is now attacking the church on all sides without ceasing in the most fierce and powerful way, and is storming towards it. 


90. the devil's way. (Cordatus No. 168.) 

The wolf has the devil's kind in many things, but he is similar to him in that he does not eat a fenced sheep, because he killed them all first. The same is found with the devil, he does not want to destroy one, but all. 1) 


91) The devil's power is seen in the case of the saints. 2) (Cordatus No. 158.) 

How powerful the devil, the prince of this world, is, cannot be seen from the fall of carnal people, nor even of wise people, nor of those who are the most perceptive by pure natural powers [in puris naturalibus], but from those who are endowed with the Holy Spirit, such as Adam, David, Solomon, Judas, Peter. For how great sins these have committed! But so it must be, that all flesh may not boast before the face of God. Lest David boast because of his government, lest Solomon exalt himself in his splendor and power 2c. In the sight of God, all saints must not be so holy that they never need to pray: Miserere mei, Deus, Lord, have mercy on me [Matth. 15, 22.] 2c. 


The Satan, when he is once seen, does not soon relent.

The one who invites the devil as a guest will not get rid of him. For D. Lucas Gauricus, the black artist, whom he had brought from Italy, has publicly confessed to me that N. N. had dealt with the devil, 


But it would have happened like this: A nobleman had a beautiful young wife, who had died to him and was also buried. Not long after that, the master and servant were lying together in a chamber, and the 


and that he wanted to help himself with the holy}deceased woman came at night and leaned over the 


scripture. He was right to do so, because it was written: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent", Gen. 3, 15. That man would have the power over the devil, that he would have to come to him if he wanted 2c., | do not want to dare, said D. Martin. 


93: Of deceased noblemen who have gone astray. 


Afterwards he told a story, which Mr. Niclas von Amsdorf would have told him for certain: How he once lay at night in an inn, two of the nobility, who had died before, would have gone with two boys, who carried torches, to him in the chamber, would have woken him up that he should get up, no harm should befall him. When he had gotten up, they would have called him to write a letter; as they had told it to him from their mouths in the pen, then ordered him: he should give it to the old M. 1); were thus gone. But he would have handed the letter over to the prince. Amsdorf indicated to me that it had certainly happened to him. Thus one sees in many histories and writings how the devil does not celebrate. He is truly not a bad master who is to be so despised; he is much closer to us than we think: he can deceive and cheat man's soul and spirit, how much more can he vex and afflict the body! 


94. How the devil can deceive people and beget children. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: That he himself had heard a story from Duke Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, that a noble family had been in Germany, that they had been born from a succubus. For that is what it is called; just as Melusina at Lucelburg was also such a succubus or devil. 


1) Margrave, Elector Joachim | of Brandenburg. Bindseil |, 207. 


master's bed as if she were talking to him. When the servant saw that this happened twice in a row, he asked the squire what it was, and whether he knew that every night a woman in white clothes came to his bed? He said, "No, he sleeps all night and sees nothing. When it was night again, the squire took care of it and woke up in bed: then the woman came before the bed again. The squire asked who she was and what she wanted. She answers: She is his housewife. He says, "Have you died and been buried? She answers, "Yes, she died because of his cursing and because of his sin, but if he wanted her back, she would become his housewife again. He says: "Yes, if only it could be. But she said, "I will not," and admonished him that he should not curse, as he had cursed him in a special way, because otherwise she would soon die again. This the man promised her. Then the deceased woman stayed with him, ruled in the house, slept with him, ate and drank with him, and fathered children. Now it happened that once the nobleman had guests, and after the meal was over, in the evening, the woman was supposed to fetch a gingerbread cake for the fruit from a box, and she stayed outside for a long time. Then the man became mischievous and cursed the usual curse, and the woman disappeared from that hour and was gone with her. Since she did not come back, they went up to the chamber to see where the woman was. There her skirt, which she had on, lay half with the sleeves in the box, but the other part lay outside, as the woman had hunkered down in the box, and the woman had disappeared, and had not been seen since that time. This is what the devil does, he can change into a woman and a man. 

Jam est Quaestio: Whether they are right women? and whether they are right children? These are my thoughts, that they are not right women. 


156 Cap. 24: Of the devil and his works. § 944-96. 157 


They can be women, but they are devils. And so go to it: the devil makes a noise before their eyes and deceives them, so that people think they are sleeping with a real woman, and yet it is nothing. The same happens when it is a man. For the devil is strong with the children of unbelief, as St. Paul says. 

But how are the children begotten? To this | say: That these sons were also devils, having such bodies as the mother. It is truly a horrible example that Satan can afflict people in such a way that he also begets children. So it is also with the mermaid in the water, who draws men to him as virgins and maidens, with whom he keeps them and begets the devil's children. Otherwise, begetting children is a divine work, and our Lord God must be the creator, because we always call him Father, and the conception must also take place per constituta media, et per homines in one moment; because he uses men as a means for creation, and through them he works alone, and not through the devil. Therefore, they must be stolen children, as the devil can steal children; as one sometimes loses children in six weeks, or they must be supposititii, change children, which the Saxons call Kielkropf. 


95 Historia von einem Wechselkinde zu Dessau. 


Eight years ago, there was one in Dessau that | saw D. M. Luther, which was twelve years old, had its eyes and all senses that one thought it was a real child. The same did nothing but eat as much as any four farmers or threshers. It ate, shat and sank, and if one attacked it, it screamed. If things went badly in the house, so that damage happened, it laughed and was cheerful; but if things went well, it cried. It had these two virtues. Then | said to the prince of Anhalt: "If | were prince or lord, | would take this child into the water, into the hollow that flows near Dessau, and would dare to commit homicide. But the Elector of Saxony, who was one of the 


Dessau, and the princes of Anhalt did not want to follow me. Then | said: "So they should have the Christians pray an Our Father in church, so that the dear God would take away the devil. This was done daily in Dessau; the same changeling died the next year. So it must be there too. Someone else has written about the Succubis and Incubis, because it is not strange. And the Succubi are women who have to do with the devil and atone for the lust of the same old whores and weather makers; as Melusina at Lucelburg was also such a Succubus and devil. 

In 1541, D. Luther also thought of this history over tables, and that he had advised the Prince of Anhalt to drown the changeling or the goitre (which is so called because it always keels in the goitre). Then he was asked why he had advised such a thing? He answered that he thought that such changelings were only a piece of flesh, a massa carnis, since there was no soul inside: for the devil could well do this, as he otherwise corrupts men who have reason, even body and soul, when he possesses them bodily, so that they neither hear, see, nor feel anything, he makes them dumb, deaf, blind: so the devil is in such changelings as their soul. It is a great power of the devil that he thus holds our hearts captive. And said, Origen did not understand the power of the devil sufficiently, because he was in the thought that at the last day the devils should be redeemed from eternal damnation. Oh, he says, it is a great sin of the devil that he knowingly sets himself against God, his Creator. 


96 Another history of a changeling. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 660.) 


It is true that the devil substitutes his children for the right ones, as it also happened in our time to someone who brought a very voracious changeling, since he was not able to satisfy it, to Our Lady in Hockstadt to be weighed there. As he crosses the river, the devil calls out of it: Kielkropp! The latter lay in a basket and 


758 


answered: O, ho! - Where do you want to go? - | want to go to Hockstadt and let myself be swayed. When the man heard this, he threw him into the river, in which they played with each other and mocked him. 

It is said that such changelings and keelheads do not live beyond eighteen or nineteen years. This often happens that the children of the women in six weeks of childbirth are confused, and the devils take their place, and make themselves nastier with shitting, eating and screaming than other ten children, so that the parents have no rest from such unfortunates, and the mothers are so sucked out that they can no longer breastfeed. 

And when Luther was asked over the table, "Are such changelings also baptized?" he answered, "Yes, because they are not known soon in the first year, but only when they suck their mothers dry. Luther then said, "Let us not despise the devil in this way, for he is truly an artist in a thousand ways. See how he tricked the poor boy who fell to his death here in Ambrosii Reuter's house in 1538 on the 5th day of December, who was a pious and diligent student; but when he was standing up in the house at four o'clock in the evening, he suddenly fell down and died. The devil can also prove this trick to pious hearts. 


Satan is a wise spirit through long experience and practice. 


Anno '39, the 15th of January, there was talk about the great security of the people in these last times. There spoke D. Martin: Oh, one must not be so sure, for we have great and mighty adversaries and enemies against us, namely the devils, which cannot be counted, so great a multitude are they; and they are not small party devils, but country devils, court devils and prince devils, who have now for a very long time, over five thousand years, become exceedingly wise and experienced through constant training. For, just think, if the devil in the beginning of the world would be a

He has been a bad creature, but he has become very cunning and wise through such long practice that he has challenged and plagued Adam, Methuselah, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, the prophets, apostles, even the Lord Christ and all believers with all his might without ceasing. 


98. from Samuel, so king Saul appeared, what it gewest. 


Doctor Martinus was asked: When Samuel, at the request of King Saul from the soothsayer, appeared to him, 1 Sam. 28, 14, whether it was the right prophet? He said, "No, it was a ghost and an evil spirit. Which proves that God forbade in Moses that one should not ask the truth from the dead; but was only the devil's specter, in the form of the man of God. Just as a sorcerer and black artist, the Abbot of Spanheim, had managed that Emperor Maximilian had seen all deceased emperors and great heroes, the new 2) best, so called, walking in his chamber one after the other, as each one had been shaped and dressed when he lived, among whom had also been the great Alexander, Julius Caesar, item, Emperor Maximilian's bride, 3) whom the King of France, Carolus 4) Gibbosus, had taken from him.

Rest of heart. Therefore let all who are tempted set before them Christ as an example and model, who 


wiles and practices. He takes the very smallest sins, |@/S° was tempted everywhere, but it was much more 


which he can make so high, that one does not know where he should stay before it. Once he really tormented me with the words of St. Paul to Timothy and almost strangled me, so that my heart wanted to melt in my body. For he reproached me and accuse me of being a cause that so many monks and nuns had run away from the monasteries 2c. 1) And too the main article of righteousness, which is before God, finely from my eyes and heart, so that | did not remember it, and held up to me the text, 1 Tim. 5:11, about the young widows, who, when they have become lustful and foolish, so that the food stings them, they want to be free, and have their judgment that they have broken the first faith 2c. And | came by the grace of God into the disputation of the law: there he had brought me naked and into a corner, that | could nowhere turn. D. Pommer was with me, | held it up to him, he went with me into the hallway: there he also began to doubt and waver, because he did not need to know that it was so urgent for me; then | was very frightened at first, and had to bite it all night with a heavy heart. The next day, D. Pommer came to me again and said: | am quite angry, | looked at the text right at first 2c. And it is true, it is a ridiculous argument; yes, if one is with himself, except for the challenge, otherwise not before. Such a fellow is the devil, he lurks everywhere for us. 

Nevertheless we have Christ, who came not to condemn but to save. If one stands on him and remains, there is no other God in heaven or on earth, but such a God who justifies and saves. Again, if you leave him out of your sight and heart, there is no help, comfort or rest. But when the saying comes: "God sent His Son, and so loved the world that He gave His Son" 2c., Joh. 3, 16. 


1) Cf. Cap. 26, § 37; Cap. 7, § 72. 





sour for him than for us. 2) 

| have often wondered how it was possible, because Christ knew that he was completely pure, that the devil could have challenged him. But that 


q|humbled him, that the devil said to him: "Do you hear? 


You are a scoundrel, you are one of the boys, you are 


, {the son of man; should you be the outlaw? Therefore 


thou art partaker of all the sins of the whole world, and of this flesh which thou hast put on. Yes, says Christ, | have done nothing. No harm, says the devil, | will find you here all the same! Therefore there is nothing in our temptation. 

| have not had a greater or more severe challenge than from my preaching, that | thought: this being you are directing everything. In my rebellion | often went into hell, until God brought me out again and comforted me that my preaching is the true word of God and the right heavenly teaching. But it costs much before one receives this comfort: with others it comes with righteousness or piety, and thereby challenges them. 

The devil wants to have only activam justitiam 3) in us, such a righteousness, which we do ourselves; so we have only passive, a foreign righteousness, which is given to us, and shall also have no activam and own, which we do, and which is valid before God. He does not want to leave us the other, namely, the alien and given righteousness of Christ; so we have only lost the activam justitiam, the righteousness that we do ourselves out of our own strength, because with it no one can stand before God. But if one rejects him and says, "Here is the one who was crucified, died and rose again for sinners: do you also know him? In whose righteousness | live, not in mine: if | have sinned, he answereth for it. And this is the very best way and way to overcome Satan through the Word. The other way is that we

We must overcome him by contempt, that we reject the thoughts he gives us, and turn our hearts to other thoughts, than to amuse ourselves with walking, eating, drinking, going to people, talking with them, and being merry, that we may get rid of heavy thoughts. This is also good, Gerson wrote about it. 

It must be so, our Lord God attacks us honestly, but he still does not leave us stuck. We should also do what is ours, and wait for our body and give it what is due to it, eat and drink, be of good cheer; according to the common old saying: Drink and eat, do not forget God. For in temptations it is a hundred times worse to fast than to eat and drink. When | am in temptation, | would not eat a morsel in three days, for | have no appetite, nor desire, nor inclination. This then is double and twofold fasting, that | eat and drink, and yet without desire. Now when the world sees such things, it regards them as drunkenness. But God will judge whether it is drunkenness or fasting. She will get the fasting, but not like me. Therefore keep your belly and head well, and do not torture yourself to death with fasting, especially when you are in melancholy, heavy thoughts and_ temptations; otherwise you have plague enough. 

It is like this with me: When | wake up at night, the devil soon comes and disputes with me, and gives me all kinds of strange thoughts, until | encourage myself and say: Kiss me on the buttocks; God is not angry, as you say. 


The devil's temptation. 

Apart from grace, said Luther, that is, according to the law we are evil. The devil is always accusing us of this temptation and tormenting us with it, especially at the last end or when we are in danger of life and limb. 


103. terrible story of a student who had surrendered to the devil. (Lauterbach, Feb. 13, 1538, p. 26.) 


On February 13, a young man, a certain Valerius (bell ringer), son of the 


Mayor in Nuremberg, absolved by Luther in the Sacristy in the presence of the deacons and his preceptor Georg M[ajor]. For this young man was very disobedient and had no _ inclination to righteousness, but was in a quite desperate situation. When he was examined by his preceptor; Why he lived without all fear of God and man? he confessed that he had surrendered to the devil five years ago with these words: | tell you (sChrist) to give up your faith and to accept another Lord. Luther questioned him about these words and pressed him hard whether he had said anything more; whether he was also sorry and now wanted to convert. When the young man imploringly agreed to this, then D. M. prayed with us. prayed the Lord's Prayer with us, laying his hands on his knees, and then added: "O Lord God, heavenly Father, you have commanded us to pray through your dear Son, and have ordained the ministry of preaching in your holy Church, that we should instruct the brethren, who may be overtaken by error, with a gentle spirit; and Christ himself says: He is not come but for the sinner's sake: therefore we beseech thee for this thy servant, that thou forgive him his sins, and receive him again into the article of remission of sins of thy holy church. 1) Then he recited to the young man in German these words, which he repeated to him one by one: | Valerius confess before God and all His holy angels, and before the assembly of the Church: that | have renounced my faith to God, [and] surrendered to the devil; | am heartily sorry for this, and now | will henceforth be a renounced enemy to the devil, and willingly follow God, my Lord, and amend myself, amen. He then exhorted him to repentance and godliness, that he should live sincerely in godliness and obedience, and resist the devil's devotions and lusts in faith and prayer. If the devil were to tempt him with evil thoughts, he should prepare himself with God's word, and quickly go to his preceptor or chaplain, and accuse and expose the devil with his counsel.

The devil's tyranny is in vain against the God-fearing. (Contained in Cap. 48, § 38.) 


How a man, who is a poor and weak creature, can overcome Satan, the most powerful and strongest enemy. 


God is even considered a fool, in that he sets against the most powerful enemy, the devil, who is mightier and stronger than a thousand Turks, man, who is a weak creature, who is like a crushed reed. It must greatly disgust the devil that he cannot overcome the common man, and that he cannot harm him, God forbid and allow him to do so. That is why Satan is angry and shoots fiery arrows into us. For this reason, we need the shield of faith. 

| have tried and experienced this fight. Now it does me no harm when | am with people. But when he seizes me alone, he teaches me morals. Satan takes the cleverest, holiest and most powerful in the world; again, God needs simple people, sends a poor peasant, a shepherd, a fisherman 2c. against them. This greatly displeases the devil. 


106 Of the power of the devil. (Lauterbach, Nov. 4, 1538, Monday, p. 156.) 


On November 4, there was a lot of talk about the power of the devil, who takes away people who are devoted to him bodily through the air. How a certain man, who had made a covenant with the devil, finally realized his danger, repented and confessed. When the hour came and was near, he often repeated: "The body is of the devil, but the soul will be saved. Finally, in the presence of many guards, he was kidnapped through the window. He answered: "One must not lure the devil, otherwise he will come and would like to be with us, as our rejected enemy. As the scripture describes him with a terrible title, where it calls him the prince of the world and a god of this world. It is a star

765 


ker, great enemy. Therefore, | believe that if infant baptism did not exist, there would be no church; for adults, seeing the power of the devil, would never take upon themselves baptism and the vow against Satan. 


The devil blinds people's eyes. 


Since H. B. was astonished that it was said that the devil could blind people's eyes, D. M. Luther said: "Do you not believe this? M. Luther said: "Do you not believe this? See how the devil can blind reason as powerfully as he blinds N. N.". At that time, the weather was remembered that had been in Nuremberg in the 33rd year on February 18, which had risen at midnight and raged so that it had torn down four thousand trees in the Nuremberg forest, and the roof on the fortress there was almost exposed in half; for a great, cruel wind had come, with thunder and lightning, so powerful that it was thought that the last day would come. 

Then said D. M. Luther: The devil makes such weather, but the good winds make the good angels. For winds would be nothing else than good or evil spirits. The devil snorts and breathes, just as the angels do when healthy, good winds blow. 


108. comfort against the devil and his scales rages. 


Dear brothers, said D. M. Luther, despise the devil quickly. For he who was crucified by him has crucified him again, the ruler of Israel, and has led him in the play, and has given us to mock, to ridicule, and to rebel against him, if we believe otherwise in the crucified one, the devil's crucifier. For though he crucify us, yet will we crucify him again, even with whom he crucified us. We will also crucify him on that day, or even before, and lead him around in the spectacle.

What Satan challenges Christians with the most. (Cordatus No. 456.) 


The devil plagues the godly with very little arguments, not because of contempt and blasphemy of the name of God, not because of faith and love, but our weaknesses he makes us very big, with snowballs he throws us and yet he magnifies his small, few and fictitious things in such a way that we believe he throws whole houses on us if we are not careful in faith. Summa: he is and remains a slanderer. If God allowed him, he would accuse us of the gravest sins against the first tablet, which we could not bear. Evil God allows him, but to afflict with greater things, the honor He has taken away from him. 


112. how to keep oneself in temptations. 


When a challenge comes, ask and say, "Devil, in what commandment is it written? If he does not indicate this, then say, "Troll yourself, you mischievous one, and let me be satisfied with the jokes. If these temptations do not want to remain outside, excommunicate them and put them under ban, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and say: God has forbidden us to take this coin. They are not Hungarian or Bohemian pennies, or the thalers of the Lords of Saxony, but are beaten by the devil; therefore we shall not take them, but reject his coin, for it is forbidden coin. 


113, Every thing has its time. 


There is a time for war, and a time for peace; there is a time to be foolish, and a time to be wise; there is also a time for temptation and sorrow, Ecclesiastes 3:1. But the Lord hears the soft sighing of the afflicted and the afflicted. 


114, Another of Luther's temptations and his thoughts. 


If heavy thoughts occur to you, dispel them with whatever you can; if you know nothing more, talk to good friends about something else that you feel like doing. One of them said, "Is it possible to do nothing great without heavy, deep thoughts? Then said D. M. Luther said: "Thoughts must be distinguished.

But the mind is not sad. 

So, when | wrote against the pope, | was not sad, because then | worked with my head and mind; then | wrote with joy: that even the preceptor of Lichtenberg 3) said to me one evening over the table: | am surprised that you can be so cheerful: if the trade were mine, | would have to die over it 2c. The pope has never hurt me, except for the first time, when Sylvester wrote against me, and put on the front of his book this title: The Holy Palace Master. Then | thought, "Corpse, will it be that the matter will come before the pope? Nevertheless, our Lord God gave me mercy, because Bachant wrote such a wicked thing that | had to laugh.

We must neither fear nor hate the temptations, but love what David did after he experienced the benefit of his temptations. Let the wicked be afraid, the Cochlaus, the Faber, the Margrave. That is, the temptation of the spirit does not concern us, because we are servants of God. 

Schlaginhaufen said: O my sins! To whom | answered, "I present to you four things which are to be held against the devil and sins: That one is baptized and absolved, that one has communicated and practices the Word daily. But if the temptation wants to hurt us a little, it does no harm, and the one who is tempted wants to call upon God, he gets angry. But whoever touches Anna, the devil will soon make it sweet. We lack only faith, which alone is the victor over all sins. And with Satan one must not argue about the law, but about grace, otherwise the evil one can make a cameo out of a louse. 


What Satan cannot do himself, he does through old wicked women. (Contained in Cap. 43, § 40.) 


The first time the author of the book was a student of theology. 


Satan wants me to look at the law, sin and death. He holds this trinity against me and torments me with it, and in it he has the advantage that sin is against God and the law. But St. Paul instructs and teaches me against it in a fine masterly way, when he says, 1 Cor. 15:57: "Thanks be to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." 

When Schlaginhaufen, the priest of Anhalt in Kéthen, complained to the doctor about his fear of prayer, he said, "He has often done it to me, but | know that | pray more a day than all the monks and priests, even though | do not babble much. And one shall

§ 115-120. 769 Do not despise the prayers described, for he who prays a little psalm shall be warmed. The devil has often reproached me and argued against the whole thing | lead and against Christ. But it is better that the temple should be torn to pieces than that Christ should remain hidden and concealed. (From here to the end of § Cordatus No. 654.) 


If any man be in affliction, or with them that are afflicted, only smite Moses dead, and cast all stones at him: but if any man recover, then shall the law be preached unto him. But to him that is afflicted no affliction need be preached. 


God gives life, the devil kills. 


Everything that God makes, He creates for life, as Jeremiah says: He creates that it be, and calls that which is not, that it be. It is said: He has a desire for life, but out of Satan's envy and malice death has come into the world, Weish. 1, 13. 14., therefore he is called a founder of death; for what does the devil do other than to deceive people from the right pure religion, awakens rebellion, war, pestilence and all misfortune? 

(Similar to Cordatus No. 275.) 


It is very beautiful that the holy scripture of GOD takes away death from GOD Himself and makes the devil the Lord of it, Ebr. 2, 14. For GOD is a GOD of life. 


119. the devil's mildness. 


The devil gives heaven before sin, and after sin he makes a despondent conscience and despair; but Christ does the opposite, he gives heaven after sin, and makes a happy conscience. 


120) How Satan dealt with D. M. Luther.

For then our conscience comes, and holds us back Satan flies the musica. from our sin: then the devil is on all sides, so that we cannot believe that God wants to hear us, thinking that we are not worthy. Moreover, the longer we pray, the worse it gets for us. 


The devil is a sad spirit and makes sad people, therefore he cannot stand happiness. Therefore, he also flees from music as far as possible: do not stay when one sings, especially spiritual songs. So David soothed Saul's affliction with his harp when the devil was tormenting him. 


Difference of obedience to God and Satan. 2) (Cordatus No. 86.) 


Between the obvious obedience to God and the devil, there is nothing more beautiful than superstition, And D. Luther turned to his table companion 1) and 3) and people perform both [obedience] with the same said: "Do you have thoughts to sell?

that no one is safe from him. What will you do with the Leviathan, he says, do you think he will fall at your feet and worship you? There are faded words and figures or pictures, so that the devil is indicated. The whale fish asks for no ship, Behemoth neither. He asks for no art, wisdom, force and power: the prince of this world considers it all stubble and straw, he asks nothing for it, itis as nothing to him. But one thing shall overthrow him, that is, God's word and faith. The seed of the woman must do it. 


131: Of Poltergeists, from M. Hieronymi Besold's Collectaneis. 


M. Luthern was told by someone over the table how the devil was rumbling and storming in his house, and yet one could not see anything, nor did it speak; and he then asked the doctor if he could ask who it was? The doctor answered, "No, don't swear at him, don't ask him, but you know who it is; you know it's the devil, and you shouldn't swear at him. And said: In Saxonia 1) a Spectrum would have run around like a dog, whom he had attacked, he had died. That could (said D. Luther) the devil well, he sees defectum complexionis; as a Medicus from the urine of the sick opportunity sees, and says: He will not live over three days 2c. Thus he sees the voluntates hominum, that one is so and so inclined against the other, and bears aversion together; then he can easily say: they will still stab each other; for he sees finely the cohaerentiam causarum. Then it goes on, if prayer does not intervene, and that our Lord God does not hurt the devil. 

Otherwise one cannot chase the devil away, because credendo in Christum, that one says: | am baptized, | am a Christian. If one calls the name of Jesus Christ with earnestness, he flees from the Semine mulieris, from Christ, because he is afraid of him, and he knows that he has corrupted his teeth in it: just as we have the teeth in the bite of an apple, so he is afraid of it. 


1) Cf. §126 of this chapter. There it says: In the Netherlands, 


he has ruined it in the semine. But if our Lord God causes the devil to become powerful over us, then it is a trial. 

It happened in Prussia, there were good full brothers in a monastery, who always carried enough beer with them into the church, because they were full day and night. Finally they start to sing the antiphon, Bonorum meorum non eget; they sing something else for it. Then the devil came out, as he had been painted in ancient times, with an infernal rod, and with the same rod he struck a blow on the earth in front of each monk, so that they all fell to the ground, and some remained dead. When an old friar, who was looking at the altar but had not entered the choir, heard this, he began to cry out: Ecce, Verbum caro factum est; and the devil quickly disappeared. 

M. Luther said: In necessitate one throws away caps, plates and all good works, and takes hold of Christ, saying: Help, dear Lord JEsu Christe; then he also helps. One does not know the devil, because in Christ. Christ illuminates us. 


132: Von des Teufels Gespenst und Betrug, from Al. Veit Dieterich's written Collectaneis. 


Over Luther's table, they talked about the Spectris and changelings: the doctor's wife, his housewife, had told a story: how a wistful mother in one place had been led away by the devil to a woman with six children, with whom the devil had had to do: she had lived in a hole in the water in the Milda 2) and the water had not harmed her at all, but she had sat in the hole as in a beautiful parlor. 

M. Luther said: "These are all Somnia. They were smothered as if he led them under the water: for the devil makes people asleep; he can do that well, and makes a jugglery before their eyes, with which they play until they awake. It is the same thing with the H6rselberg, in the

They told him that they would be their neighbors. When it was time to go to bed, and everyone wanted to sleep, and the guests were still to come, the bishop asked the innkeeper to let him lie in the parlor, for he would like to see the guests. The innkeeper agrees. He lies down and keeps watch; then the guests come in, and they are all Daemonia. He looked at them and told them to stay there and not to leave until he told them to.

133. mockery of the devil against the monks. 


Doctor Martin Luther once said that the devil had possessed a farmer bodily in one place. Now there had been a monk who had wanted to cast him out, and had taken other monks with him, who had gone in

134 Of the Devil's Rumble. 


When the devil is driven out of the houses where he roars, so that he no longer has to go around and roar (once said D. M. Luther), then he leads into the people, as, into the heretics, Rottengeister, into coiner and his kind; item, into the usurers and others. 

But it is not a strange, unheard-of thing that the devil rumbles and roams about in the houses. | heard him several times in our monastery in Wittenberg.

Duke Johansen of Saxony was also plagued by the devil when S. F. G.'s last husband died in 1521, that he rumbled in the castle as if his husband's soul was perishing. But S. F. G. wrote to me, D. M. Luthero, and offered to give a thousand guilders, from which one should keep soul measurement, and asked me for advice, what S. F. G. should do in this? But | answered S. F. G. that he should by no means establish a soul mass, but rather he should only despise the devil and his polishing, then he would probably remain outside. 


135 From a Tenfelsheinzlein. 


The Epicureans, said D. M. Luther, think nothing of either God or the devil. One of them said: "Should they not fear him, since they see that the devil possesses people physically? The doctor answered and said, "They think this is phantasia, or melancholy. As that maid also did: she always had a devil sitting with her at the hearth, because he had his own little town, which he kept very clean; as the devil likes to keep it clean where he is; as the fly also likes to shit on the clean, as, on white paper. Now once the maid asked the little Heinz (for so she called the devil), he should let himself be seen, how he would be shaped; but the little Heinz would not do it, until once the maid went into a cellar, then she saw a dead child swimming in a barrel. Then it was revealed who the devil was, namely, autor caedis; for the maid had once had a child, and had strangled it and put it into the barrel. 


136. of the devil's cunning and ravings against us men. 


One told about M. Luther's table, how one had almost choked on a bit of bread. Item, another would have fallen down from the house and would have remained almost dead. Then said 


so close behind us. But the race does not believe that it is the devil, it thinks it happens casu. Therefore, when you are in danger and the devil wants to throw you down the stairs, call out, "Help, dear Lord Jesus Christ," and take up the cross in front of you, but in faith, the devil will control himself, for he does not like this name. The devil is angry with us because of the man of Christ, whom he cannot stand. That is why it is called Orate. Item: Sufficiat tibi gratia mea, he said to St. Paul, 2 Cor. 12, 9: Let it suffice thee that | hear thee, and call thee to pray. Here then belongs the Doctrina de officio Angelorum bonorum et malorum. If then the devil tempts you, say: | ama Christian. As that virgin said, | am baptized, and my name is Christiana; so the devil does not stay long. 

And D. Luther told a story about it: That in a monastery there had been a possessed brother, who could see when someone stranger would come. Once he said to the conductor (he called him a porter, like Judas): "Listen, you will have guests today, order the kitchen. This happened. After that the vicar of the same order came and traveled to the monastery; there he said again: Listen, porter, the little David is coming, order the kitchen; called the vicar thus, because he was a little man; and had said: | wanted to have thrown him down the stairs, but the width (called the virgin Mariam thus) helped him. There one sees, how the devil is a liar. 

When the vicar came, the conductor asked him if he had been in danger on a staircase. Then he confessed that he had almost fallen down a staircase. Finally, they wanted to help him and asked for advice everywhere for the sake of this brother. Then the abbot of the cell in Meissen advised that he should be accufiren inobedientiae and prodded with rods. This was done, and he was brought before them. When he saw the rod, he cried out, "Not with the rod, for many heathen brothers have been beaten with it," but they continued. Then the devil went out. These are only the devil's mendacia and illusions.

How Luther was able to despise the devil's temptation. (The first paragraph was contained in Cap. 24, K114, therefore omitted). 

Dominare in medio inimicorum tuorum, Psalm 110, 2. This reads as if our Lord God should say to the devil: | know it well that you are Dominus mundi and supreme abbot in this monastery. Nevertheless, | will place the Lord Christin your rule, and he shall remain with me. Defy him who does anything to him. He has now reigned over five thousand years, and if this lord were nothing, his kingdom would have long perished. For all other idolatries have ceased, and other new ones have risen in their place. But this Lord Christ remains alone, because the Father has placed him there: Constituit eum super montem Sion ejus. The crucified Christ, who is thus weak and martyred, shall thus pass through. Therefore the 24th Psalm, v. 7, says: Attollite portas principes vestras; as if David should say: Ge 


think and let him rule, be obedient to him. Now they say, v. 8: Quis est iste Rex gloriae? Ei, it is Dominus exercituum. See how David is such a fine poet above all poets. But N. and N. think: We will stake our country on it, and not suffer the gospel and Christ. But David says here: "You must obey him, or you will all perish. A Christian should know the Psalter as well as he knows his five fingers. According to this, the four evangelists are also very clear. 

St. Bernard used to say, said D. M. Luther: Ecce, in p:me amaritudo mea amarissima; id est, in peace my sadness is greatest. The church is never worse than when it has peace and tranauility.

1. how D. L.'s mother was plagued by a sorceress. 


Doctor M. Luther said a lot about sorcery, about the heart potion and the Alps, how his mother had been plagued by her neighbor, a sorceress, so that she had to keep her in the most friendly and glorious way and reconcile her, because she shot her children so that they cried themselves to death. And a preacher punished her only in general, then she bewitched him, that he had to die, one could help him with no medicine. She had taken the earth when he had risen and thrown it into the water and bewitched him with it, without which earth he could not get well again.

Our soul and body are completely subject to vanity. Therefore, even though the soul is liberated through faith in Christ, our body is still subject to the devil's murder 1). That is why sorceries are brought against the believers, and | believe that my illnesses are partly sorceries and not purely natural. God, however, frees His own from such evils.

3. from jugglers. 


In N. 1) there was one, named Wildferer, who ate a farmer with horse and cart; which farmer then lay for several hours, over several field paths in a puddle with horse and cart. So a monk was talking to a farmer who had a load of hay for sale at the market, and he asked him what he would take and let him eat the hay. Then the farmer said: He wanted to take one kreuzer. The monk began, and had almost eaten up the hay, so that the farmer had to drive him away. 

Similarly, a debtor had a leg torn off by a Jew, so that the Jew ran away and he was not allowed to pay him 2c. So mighty is the. So mighty is the devil to deceive people in the outward senses; what should he not do in the soul? 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, 22 Febr, 1538, p. 39.) 


A certain citizen of Brandenburg, bewitched by witches, lost all blessings of goods. He went to a devil's soothsayer in Berlin to ask him for advice. At last his tormented conscience sought consolation. Luther answered: He has acted wickedly and ungodly. Why should he not stop after the example of Job with prayer for the blessing of God? Tell him that he should become reasonable again and no longer take refuge in Satan, but that he should bear God's will with equanimity. 


4, from a charmed maiden. (Lauterbach, Aug. 20, 1538, p. 117.) 


On this day, D. Spalatin reported about the impudence of the witches, that a certain girl in Altenburg sheds bloody tears; if that woman is there, even if she does not see her, nor knows [that she is there, she feels her presence and sheds the tears. Luther answered: Then one should hurry to the court with such. The jurists want to have too much testimony, despise these revealed [facts] |, he said, have had a marriage case these days, where the wife wanted to poison her husband, so.

that he has broken out lizards, and_ she, embarrassingly questioned, has answered nothing, because such witches are dumb, despise the tortures; the devil does not let them speak. These facts give enough evidence that an example should be made of them, to frighten others. 


5. from milk thieves. (Lauterbach, Aug. 25, 1538, p. 121.) 


On August 25, people said a lot about sorceresses and witches who steal eggs from hens and milk and butter. Luther answered: "You don't have to feel sorry for them. | wanted to burn them myself, according to the custom of the law, where the priests began to stone the guilty; for it is said that their butter, because it is stolen, stinks, falls to the ground in the food, and the sorceresses are tormented willy-nilly, when milk and butter are put on burning coals, then they are so tormented by the devil that they are forced to come. The village priests and schoolmasters knew their art a long time ago and plagued them well. But D. Pomer's art is the best, that one plagues them with the dirt and often stirs it, then all their things become dirty. 


6. from two sorceresses. 


There was talk of two sorceresses at D. Martina’'s, who in an inn had set two jars of water aside for the evening, in one place; and they discussed with each other whether it should be for the grain or wine. When the innkeeper, who was standing on a secret corner, heard this, he took both of the jars or stouts, and when they had gone to bed, he poured them over them; then the water turned to ice, so that they both died of it from that hour on. Said D. Martinus: The devil is very powerful in the sorceresses. 


7. magic on theologically painted. 

Although all sins are an apostasy from God's works, so that God may be grievously angered and offended; yet sorcery, by reason of its abomination, may be rightly called crimen laesae Majestatis divinae, a rebellion, and such a vice, that one may beware of 


784 Cap. 25: Of sorceries. § 7. 8. 785 


namely, against the divine majesty in the highest way. For as the jurists artificially discuss and speak of various kinds of rebellion and abuse against the high majesty, and among others they also count this, when one becomes a fugitive from his lord, disloyal and goes to the enemies: and to all such they recognize the punishment of life and limb. So also, because sorcery is a _ shameful, abominable apostasy, when one goes from God, to whom he is pledged and sworn, to the devil, who is God's enemy; so it is justly punished in body and life. 


8. that one sorcery has paid for another. 


Emperor Frederick, Maximiliani's father, had a black artist invited to the meal and made by his skill and art, 





that the black artist got ox feet and claws on his hands, and sitting above the table, the emperor told him to eat. But he was ashamed and hid the claws under the table. At last, when he could no longer retrieve them, he had to let them be seen. Then he said to the emperor: | will also make something for Her Majesty, if she allows me. Then the emperor said: Yes. Then he made a noise with his magic outside the emperor's chamber; and when the emperor looked out of the window and wanted to know what was there, he got big antlers and deer horns on his head, so that he could not bring his head back in the window. And said D. M. Luther: That pleases me well, when one devil vexes the other and geheiet; from this | conclude that one devil is stronger than the other.

One should not argue with Satan about the law. He who disputes with the devil about the law has lost. He only stops at the right time. Therefore, let no one dispute with this excellent speaker about the law or about sin, for he has the handwriting against us. He can make a big mountain out of a beam, therefore he must be overcome with the word of the gospel and the doctrine of grace, which annoys him very much. Judas is as necessary in the number of apostles as otherwise three apostles, and solves countless arguments 2c. | know, praise God, that my cause is good, right and divine; for if the gospel, baptism, sacrament and absolution are right, then | am also right. If Christ is not in heaven and a Lord over all, then my cause is wrong. What | teach, write, preach, and intend to do in the school and church, | do freely in public during the day, not hidden in

| am in a corner, and | judge everything from the Gospel, baptism, the Lord's Prayer 2c. The evil one still wants to turn everything around for me. Christ stands there, | cannot deny him. | base my cause on the gospel; if | revoke it, my God will protect me. Nevertheless, he often brings it so close to me with his disputes that | break out in a cold sweat. He is fiercely angry, | understand and feel that. He sleeps much closer and more with me than my Katha, that is, he makes me more uneasy than she makes me happy. 

But through the gospel, | solve and dispel all his arguments, if only | can remember it and take hold of it, and meet him with it. But | sometimes lack it. That is why he reproaches me: The law is also God's word, why then do | always hold the gospel against him? Yes, | say, but as far apart from the gospel as heaven and earth. For in the Gospel, God confides in us His grace, wants to be our God, and out of pure love gives us His only begotten Son, who redeemed us from sin and death and acquired eternal righteousness and life through His suffering and resurrection. 


788 


| do not want to make him a liar. Besides the gospel, he also gave the law, but for a different use. 


2. power of the divine word. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1362.) 


When the devil finds me idle and without reflection | 


on the Word, he drives into my conscience that | have disturbed the world order by false teaching, that | have stirred up sedition, he often brings me to that. But when | take the floor again, | am victorious. For | counter him that my teaching is not mine, but the Son of God's, that God does not ask about worlds, even if ten of them were rebellious and perished. It is said [Matth. 17, 5.]: "You shall hear him," or it] overthrows all in one heap, and [Pf. 2, 10. 12.]: "Let yourselves therefore be instructed, ye kings,” "that ye perish not." Thus Paul also had to comfort himself when they accused him in the Acts of the Apostles [16, 20.; 17, 6.; 24, 5.] as a rebel against GOD and the emperor. God wants the article of justification in its entirety, and if men accept it, they will not lose the rule of the world and the household; but if they do the opposite, they may blame themselves for the evil. 

So Christ also had to die, as if he had forbidden to give the emperor the womb, arousing the people; item, blaspheming God, that he had made himself the son of God. Therefore | say to the devil: As you have been disgraced in Christ and Paul, Squire Satan, so shall it be with me 2c. 


3. how a Christian should resist the heavy thoughts of death, which the devil gives him, as if God were angry with him; but if he gives us a thought of death, he will be angry with us. 

Christ sent, that we should live through him 2c. 


All gloom and sadness comes from the devil, for he is a lord of death, Ebrews 2:14; especially when a man is sad and anxious, as if he had an ungracious God, it is surely the devil's work and operation. Therefore, if a heavy thought comes into your head, as if God wants to be 


Cap. 26. of challenges. § 1-3. 





789 


have mercy on you, or that he will let you die in your sins and condemn you, or that you will now give up the ghost because of fear, then soon conclude that such a thought comes from the devil. For this reason God does not afflict, does not terrify, does not kill, but is a God of the living, and sent his only begotten Son into the world, not to terrify sinners, but to comfort them; and Christ died and rose again to destroy death, which is the work of the devil, and to become Lord over it, and to make us alive. Therefore in the Scriptures these and similar words of comfort are used: Be glad. Rejoice in the Lord. Do not fear. Be undaunted. Be of good cheer, | have overcome the world. The sting of death has become dull and chipped on me, even broken. 

Therefore, you should take courage in such a challenge and think that from now on you are not a man's child, but God's child through faith in Christ, in whose name you were baptized: therefore death cannot thrust its spear into you. For if you belong to Christ, believe in him and have been baptized into him, death has no right over you, much less can it harm you, for he is eternally devoured through Christ. 

But the wicked Satan resists as much as he can, so that such good, comforting thoughts of God do not occur to us in our temptation; or he darkens and obscures them for us. For the heart of the one who is challenged is then so violently taken up with the heavy thoughts of the law, of sin and death, that it cannot grasp the article of justification and faith: | believe in Jesus Christ 2c., much less comfort itself. 

On the other hand, all joy, comfort, peace, well- disposed, joyful heart in Christ comes from God. 1) For the Holy Spirit is undaunted and undaunted in the hearts of believers; indeed, He is the courage and comfort even in the trials of death. He speaks out courageously: World, sin, death, hell, leave me alone, you have no part in me: if you will not let me live, then | will die, in God's name. 


1) Cf. cap. 38, § 12. 


790 Cap. 26. of challenges. §3-6. 791 


But you shall not succeed. If you cut off my head, it won't hurt; | have one who will probably put it back on. 


4. use of the challenges. 


Such trials are not only necessary for us, but also good and useful, otherwise we would surely go without all fear of God and not call on him for help. For he who is healthy and happy has no need of a physician or comforter; then the devil could easily deceive us. After this, temptation also serves to make us live in the fear of God, walk carefully, pray without ceasing, grow in the grace and knowledge of Christ, and learn the power of the word: and though we are still weak, yet the power of our Lord Christ is mighty in the weak, 2 Cor. 12:9. 


5. temptations are a sure sign that God loves us, because He chastens all whom He receives. 

(Cordatus No. 863,564,565,566,567. The last number here 

transferred from § 35 of this chapter). 

Better is the sadness of the spirit than the security of the world. And the temptation that torments the conscience is twofold, for the devil torments us first with lies when he accuses us, who are justified by faith, of sin, but he attacks the body with murder. By sadness he kills the body, by certainty the conscience, that is, as much as is in it. Furthermore, let no one choose a trial, but when it comes, let him suffer it, and let him think that it will profit him very much. 

From all temptations we shall learn by experience that the devil kills with lies and murders. Through the spirit of sadness he denies us the joy of conscience from faith, his lie is opposed to the truth of Christ. He will not yet tear Christ down from heaven; when he has done so, | will hang myself on the nearest tree. 

Since one 1) said he would rather suffer the greatest diseases than this his challenge 


1) According to Rebenstock II, 223 d D. Hieronymus Weller. 


of conscience, he answered, After that are the diseases. For to every sickness impatience is added, and the devil's delight is lifted up, which happened to Job, who at first was very patient. But when he said in his heart, "God is angry," he became angry, and blasphemously said, "God is no longer merciful," which is to say, "God has changed His nature. But if He has not changed His nature, He does not cease to be merciful. 

But that God puts an end to all temptation, | ama witness, for ten years ago my body was so tormented by sadness that | could hardly breathe. The cause of this is that God calls to that which is not that it be. [So he delivered me alone, by struggling and writing, alone, | say, for whomsoever | approached and sought comfort, all answered, | know not his. He is not alone who is challenged, which the Psalm indicates [Ps. 116, 11.]: "I spoke in my trembling" 2c. There, of course, one finds temptations in the Psalter. | have experienced this verse every night [Ps. 6, 7]: "| wash my bed all night long"; nevertheless, the devil does not get the upper hand, because he has burned himself on Christ. 

The sadness of the spirit is the conscience itself, which, suffering the same, gives birth to the last day. But since we give birth to him, we will not perish for Christ's sake, because Satan has not yet condemned Christ. And such a contested one does not feel temptations of the body, like those of fornication. Such little devils have nothing to do there, but the passions hinder good works, because a fornicator does not study. 

(Here a paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 58, 

§ 9, and Cap. 13, § 70.) 


6. blasphemy is twofold. 


When one of them told D. Martin, "How that another was severely challenged, that he did not find in him a perfect righteousness, that he was not as pious as God requires of us in the Law, and in prayer always felt such blasphemy against Christ," D. Martin said. Martin: This is a good sign; for blasohemy 


792 


is twofold: An activa, really, when one knowingly and wantonly seeks causes to blaspheme God; as Faber (Doctor Schmid) does, H. M. 1) 2c. God protect us from that. The other is a suffering blasphemy, passiva, when the devil, against our will, gives us such evil thoughts before we know it, and we resist them: with which God wants us to be exercised, so that we do not lie and snore, or become lazy, but fight and pray against them. So at last such thoughts will disappear and subside, especially at the last end. Then the Holy Spirit is with his Christians, assists them, drives away the fierce devil, subdues him and makes a fine calm and peaceful heart and conscience. 

Therefore write to him, said D. Luther, that he neither worry nor torture himself, but be confident, trust God, and keep his word: the devil will then cease from himself to awaken and _ increase such blasphemy. But as far as perfect righteousness is concerned, that he would like to be completely righteous and pious, and feel and experience that he is completely holy and pure, nothing will come of it in this life, but this is an angelic life that will happen to us in the life to come. Here we are to be satisfied with the righteousness of Christ, which he has earned and merited for us with his rose-colored, innocent blood, and bestows it on us in the Word out of pure grace and mercy, without any merit or worthiness on our part, to those who grasp it with faith, and then prove it with good works, as_ fruits, which God has commanded, not we ourselves choose, 2c. 


7. to overcome temptations. (Contained in Cap. 26, § 16.) 


8. what one cannot prevent, and is wrong, he should have patience and pray, but not approve, but command God. 

David was a wonderful man, because he was allowed to teach and speak publicly against the false worship of the Jewish people.

§6-12. 793 

He was the first to see the people, and yet he could not prevent it. He saw one of them measuring and sacrificing, and the other one teaching falsely. And these were the greatest and most mighty multitude. If he had been able to overthrow and defend everything with his might, he would have done so; but because he knew neither counsel nor help against it, he had to have patience, and sang a little song to our Lord God about it, and called to him. 


9. remedy against useless thoughts. 


When I, said D. Martin, when | am in thoughts concerning the worldly or domestic government, | take a psalm or a saying of Paul and fall asleep over it. But the thoughts that come from the devil cost me something more: there | have to make a strong joke until | pull myself out.

(12) Challenge teaches, but we soon forget. (Cordatus No. 283.) 


When one challenge is over, there is certainly already another one that we have to face; but when the other one comes, we should hold ourselves in the same way, 2) as if it were the first one and we had not experienced any before. But we are thus dismayed, or sometimes we succumb to the new-arriving [temptations], since we should have become wiser through the experience of the former. This is reproved by the evangelist, who says, "And they heard not of the loaves." And Paul exhorts and says: "And do not grow weary" [Eph. 6, 13.namely because one temptation follows another. For all at once afflict our flesh for our good.

Pious Christians have to suffer a lot. 

’) The barley must suffer much from people. First, it is thrown into the ground so that it rots. When it has grown and ripened, it is cut or chopped off. Then it is threshed and soaked, dried and boiled to make beer or kofent, which is drunk by the peasants and given back down and up, and peed on the fences. 

Flax is a similar martyr. When it is ripe, it is gathered, roasted, dried, blued, broken, spun, woven, and made into canvas for shirts and coats, which are then torn. Then they use it for wiping, smearing plasters on it, which they put on wounds and sores. Item, the rags are taken from it, put them in stamps on the paper mill, crushes it small: from it one makes paper for playing cards, for writing, for printing: the paper is torn, and used for the very lowest works. 

These and many such creatures, from which we have much benefit, must suffer. So all godly and pious Christians must suffer much from the wicked and evil ones. David was a wonderfully chosen man and was rolled away desolately. But such a man is dear to God. Barley, wine, grain 2c. have an advantage over flax and flax, become flesh and blood, and inherit the kingdom of God in the godly and Christians. But at the last judgment they will cry out against the godless peasants, burghers, nobles 2c. and accuse them of having abused them so shametully. 


At one time D. M. Luther told this rhyme: Christ lets sink well, but not drink away. 


15. consequence of the challenge. (Cordatus No. 1541.) Cross and persecution teaches one the golden art.

. 26.0f challenges. § 13-16. 


795 


16. what challenges are for. (The first three paragraphs of this § at Cordatus No. 813. 814. 815.) 


No one can write or speak anything properly about grace unless he has been exercised by spiritual trials. The monks and the lawyers have not been able to speak of it properly. 

If | dispute with the devil about the law, he has won. Therefore, | will help stone Moses, or he will remain with the defiant and stiff-necked people, not with the fearful and faithful consciences. 

The wicked are made worse by the preaching of the gospel, for they learn from it only the licentiousness of the flesh. Therefore, the people belong under the law, not under the gospel. For it happens to them as to evil-disposed and evil-acting children, who become worse when they are honored and not chastised when they have sinned. A rod belongs on wicked children, not sugar. 

This distinction is to be diligently noted and kept, that the ungodly may be terrified and deceived by the law, and held as prisoners in a dungeon; but grieved and distressed consciences, recognizing their sin, feeling the wrath of God, and being terrified, are to be restored and comforted with the gospel, 2) preaching Christ to them, that the heavenly Father has accepted and loved them with grace, out of pure mercy, for the sake of His dear Son JEsu Christ. To him he has earnestly commanded that we should hear him saying, "Be of good cheer." "Fear not, | have overcome the world," John 16:33. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden," 2c., Matt. 11:28. Therefore, if ye will hear Christ, and call upon him in time of trouble, all things shall be added unto you. 

And this is the right worship, yea, the very easiest, and comforting to the poor, troubled, and burdened consciences, who otherwise cannot do the law enough, and are grieved because they have not kept it, nor are able; to whom the gospel is to be preached and reproached.

All temptation is to forget the present and desire the future, as Eve did in Paradise. 


The Christian victory through the Holy Spirit. (Lauterbach, April 25, 1538, p. 69.) 

On April 25, he spoke much of human frailty, which would be exposed to all temptations and dangers, internal and external, the devil and the spirits in the air, and if GOD were not for us, who could endure it One Hour? That is why the Scripture calls the Holy Spirit by a very beautiful name tTrapdyAn-o, i.e. an advocate who guides our cause in the dispute, gives victory to faith, intervenes in the case, chases away Satan. This is the victory of faith, by which we overcome the world, not by our strength and power, but by the action of the Holy Spirit and faith. It is truly something great that the wretched flesh and blood of the [weak] little children of men can overcome those spirits and powers of the devils. 


19. Christians must suffer. 


We, who are baptized, must endure and suffer, both active and passive, from God, who works and creates everything in them, as a potter prepares the clay, and from the devil and the world, who afflict them and wear them down, so that a Christian only suffers constantly and is a true martyr. 

Item: When M. Georg Rorer's little children lay ill, D. Martinus said: Our Lord God vexes all his saints, they must all drink from the chalice. He did the same to Mary, his mother. Summa, what is dear to him, that must endure. Christians overcome when they suffer, and when they fight, they lose. | am afraid of that. 


(Here 4 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 26, § 33.) 


20 Not everyone can endure temptations in the same way. (Cordatus No. 475.) 


Just as strong bones must be there to support the great mass of the body, so 


God does not lay great or many trials on the weak, because if there were all flesh, not bones and nerves, it would fall in a heap. That is how it is in the Church, that is why we pray for each other. And since it is impossible for the human heart to have and keep the fear of God, the very best treasure, without the cross, the temptation is something very good, and whoever has temptations certainly has a gracious God. What are we groaning for? 


David's trials were much more severe than ours. 


David must have had worse devils than we do, for he could not have had such a great revelation without great temptations, for they are great and glorious. David made and sang psalms, let us also, as best we can, make and sing psalms, in honor of our Lord God, and to the displeasure of the devil and his bride. 


(22) How to comfort one who is challenged and thinks he has sinned against the Holy Spirit, which sin is not forgiven. 


Doctor M. Luther, when asked about this, said: "Let it be said to him that he is idle in his temptation and does not worry about it, for he is not guilty of such sin. Our Lord God does not say to an adulterer or a murderer, "You have trampled my son's blood underfoot,” but: If you are sorry and believe in the Son, your sins are forgiven. As he said to the adulteress, Joh. 8, 11. and to the murderer at the cross. But to the Pharisees and scribes, who opposed the righteousness of the gospel and trusted in their own piety, he said, "Woe to you. 

Then one asked him, "Did he also sin against the Holy Spirit who knowingly denies the word of God, as there are many of them now among the rulers of George who deny it? No, he said, because it is done in weakness; as Peter denied Christ, and yet did not sin against the Holy Spirit; but Judas persisted in it, truly repenting, and remaining obdurate. 


798 Cap. 26. of challenges 


How M. Luther answered the devil when he challenged him at night. 


When the devil comes to me at night, 1) said D. Martinus, to trouble me, | give him this answer: Devil, | must sleep now, for this is God's command and order, to work by day and sleep by night. On the other hand: If he will not desist, and holds my sin against me, then | say: Dear devil, | have heard the register, but | have done another sin, which is not in your register, write it also: | have thrown in my pants, hang iton my neck, and wipe my mouth on it. Thirdly: If he now continues, presses hard, and accuses me as a sinner; then | despise him and say: Sancte Satana, ora pro me: Dear devil, pray for me, for you have never done evil, you alone are holy. Go to God and obtain mercy for yourself; and if you want to make me pious, | say to you: Medice, cura te ipsum: Physician, help yourself. 

The devil, however, is such a wicked man that he does not bring great and heinous sins before me and keeps them, namely, keeping Mass, despising God 2c. Also, God protect me for this.

(24) For which people are chastened by God. 


The godly is chastened, lest he be condemned with the world; but the ungodly, that he may know himself, or be hardened. The greater the Christian, the greater the condemnation; the greater the sin, the greater the fear.

overcome the world. Because of God, we are commanded to be joyful. Be joyful. But | preach it now, and | also write it, but | do not understand this art yet, when we are challenged like this. This fruit we have from being instructed. If we should always have peace, the devil should cheat us. God knows that our hearts are frightened. Therefore He speaks and commands: Do not let your heart be troubled. Furthermore, we are not equal to the holy fathers in faith. But the less we are compared to the fathers, the more glorious victory this will bring for Christ. For we are very inexperienced, very weak, very foolish against the devil, for he has a great advantage over us, because there was such great wisdom, power, holiness and faith in the fathers. Namely, our Lord God wants to put an end to extreme foolishness. Paul had to say: | alone am an apostle for all attempts of the devil. Either hypocrisy or violence rules. Violence with the rebels like Muenzer, hypocrisy with the monks and in the papacy. The devil often tormented me with these words: Who sent you to teach against the monasteries? Likewise: Before there was the most beautiful peace, which you have disturbed, who ordered you to do it? Here a certain one interrupted the speech and said: Your fatherliness has not commanded it, neither with regard to the monasteries, nor to disturb the peace. But he [God] only taught: "In vain do they serve me, because they teach such doctrines, which are nothing but the commandments of men" (Matth. 15, 9.); from this then followed of its own accord and from God's permission that which your fatherliness says. Luther said: "Before this occurs to me, | have already left a sweat over it. 


(38) Wherever the gospel is taught purely, persecution and temptation always follow. 


The gospel cannot be without persecution. For the man who is called Christ must taste blood; as Moses' wife said before to her husband, Moses, Ex. 4:25: "Thou art a bridegroom of blood unto me." For the Antichrist cannot be Christ's friend; as we now, in our times, know by experience.

He would have eaten and devoured us all. | am the Pabst's Kaulbars, which has spiky scales, which he cannot devour. He found a hedgehog to chew on me. 


39. comfort for one who is challenged. 


The Lord, our God, is a God of the humble and afflicted, who are in distress, temptation, persecution and danger, in which God demonstrates His power and strength. For if we were strong, we would be proud and hopeful, since God cannot show and prove His power except in our weakness. He does not extinguish the smoldering wick; neither will he crush the broken reed. But the devil would like to extinguish it and crush everything. 

God loves temptations and is also hostile to them. He loves them when they provoke and entice us to pray and to trust in Him; He is hostile to them when we despair for their sake. Therefore said D. Martinus said: "If you are well, sing a little song to God and praise him; but if you are not well, call on God and pray, for "the Lord is pleased with those who fear him and wait for his goodness,” Ps. 147:11. Peace has its time, war has its time; being wise and foolish has its time; being happy and sad, as well as affliction and temptation, also has its time. It is with us, like the April weather. 

He who feels that he is weak in faith desires to be strong: the food pleases God in us and is pleasing to Him. Oh, how great a part and piece of righteousness it is to desire to be righteous and godly. Therefore, do not despair, but straighten yourself up and comfort yourself with God's word and with the examples of the holy Scriptures. For God, who has helped all the patriarchs, prophets and saints, will not abandon you. 


40. contestation of faith. 


The contestation of faith is the very greatest and heaviest; for faith is supposed to be the 


806 


Cap. 26. of challenges. § 40-43. 


807 





And the other temptations must all be overcome. If this one is defeated, then all the others, even the smallest and worst, must overtake man. But since faith remains, one can despise the greatest temptations and dangers. For if faith is right and sound, all other temptations must diminish and abate. This challenge to faith has been St. Paul's scolops, a great spit and stake that has passed through both spirit and flesh, body and soul. It has not been a challenge nor a plague of carnal immorality, as the papists dream, when they have felt no other but such carnal immorality. They have not tried the great battles, nor have they ever experienced them; therefore they speak and write of them as the blind do of paint. 


41. how to resist spiritual temptations, r) (Lauterbach, Jan. 5, 1538, p. 4.) 


Holy devil, pray for us, if we have not sinned against you, merciful Lord Devil, you have not created us, nor given us life. Why then do you accuse us so harshly before God, as if you were so holy and the supreme judge of the right saints of God? Take the staff in your hand and go to Rome to your servant, whose idol you are. (Mockery of Satan.) 


From what causes God lays out the holy cross to the godly. (Lauterbach, Feb. 20, 1538, p. 34.) 


God puts tribulations on the believers because of what is still backward in the flesh and because of the present sin. Therefore, the argument is not valid: the righteous must have it good; the believers in this life are righteous; therefore, they must have it good. It is to answer the subordinate clause: the pious are righteous in this life by imputation [of righteousness], but because of the flesh which they still have about them, they feel the tribulations. The supersentence is a sentence of the law. 


1) According to the sense contained in Cap. 24, § 14. § 44; Cap. 26, § 23. 


43. the greater the saints before God, the greater the challenge. 

(Lauterbach, March 29, 1538, p. 49f., except the last 

paragraph.) 

Then came Doctor Weller, very challenged and fainthearted, whom Luther comforted to take heart in the Lord and deal with men, and asked him whether he was angry with God, or with Luther, or with himself. He answered: | confess my murmuring against God. On the other hand, he said: God does not give up anything. | myself often serve my God in this way. If | should put on good incense to him, | bring stinking pitch and devil's filth of grumbling and impatience, and if we did not have the article of the forgiveness of sins, of which God has promised for certain that he shall perform it, we would be in a bad way. Weller said: The devil can seek you out masterfully where it hurts the most. [Yes, he does not learn that from us. He can do it very nimbly, because if he did not give it to the patriarchs, prophets and the prince of the prophets, Christ, then he will not overtake us either. He can make the most wonderful final speeches: You have sinned, God is angry with sinners, therefore despair. Then we must descend from the law to the gospel and take hold of the article of the forgiveness of sins. You are not alone, dear brother, in suffering these temptations. For Peter admonishes that we should not let it alienate us that the same afflictions come upon us as upon the brethren (1 Pet. 4:12; 5:9). Moses, David, Isaiah suffered much. What do you think that David will have had for temptations when he made the Psalm (6.): "Oh Lord, do not punish me in your anger" 2c. He would much rather have perished by the sword than have felt the horror against GOD and GOD against him. | believe that such confessors far surpass the martyrs, who daily see the idolatries, aversions, sins, happiness and security of the wicked, but the fear of the pious, who find themselves like sheep for slaughter.

And yet there was no sin: item Ps. 73, 21: "It stings me in my kidneys," that is, a spear goes through my kidneys.

49) What the cross and the challenge are good for. 


(Lauterbach, Aug. 31, 1838, p. 125.) 


On the last day of August, Luther was informed by Jonas of the many and varied temptations with which the pious were whimsically afflicted. He answered: "One must have patience and pray. For if everything went according to our will, we would only become sluggish and brutish, as happened to the Romanists. Therefore, the temptations are our best remedies, which strengthen us against many evils, as your stone, D. Jonas, makes you suffer and is of more use to you than ten cotters. 2) God knows best how he must govern the life of his own; we are to obey according to our profession. 

(The last paragraph is spurious, an adaptation of Aurifaber on 

Cap. 20, § 7, which immediately follows this § in the original). 


1) The idiom is taken from court proceedings, where names are called out to determine who is there. Hence responaentes, answerers. The meaning is: Christ, by seme representation, does everything, man nothing. 


2) Kux -- share in a mine. 


The unchallenged understand nothing in the matters of God. 


The temptations of God-fearing Christians are powerful and useful, and a proper Christian school and training for the flesh and blood. He who is not tempted nor challenged understands and knows nothing. Therefore the whole Psalter is almost in every verse nothing but temptation, grief, sorrow, and a book full of temptations. The temptations of the holy fathers are childish in comparison, in the first table of the ten commandments of God; like St. Jerome's temptation of carnal lust. Ah! the great temptations can well ward off the party devils. Therefore, they do St. Paul injustice by blaming him for longing for the Thecla, as if he had called it a stake in the flesh, when it says that Satan's angel beat him with his fists.

When he then inquired where her former thoughts were, she answered: | have forgotten her. So do good, you who are afflicted. But the fornicators must fast. 

Where there is a melancholy head, there the devil has his bath. For such a one, a hungry stomach or a lonely life does not fit. Here belongs the example of the bishop's sister. [In the preceding.]

When | went to another one after that, | felt the same way. In sum, no confessor wanted to know anything about it. Then | thought, no one has this torment and temptation but you. Then | became a dead corpse. At last, Father Staupitz spoke to me over the table, because | was so sad and exhausted, and said: "How are you so sad, Father Martine? Then | said: Ah! where shall | go? And he said, Alas! You do not know that such treatment is good and necessary for you, otherwise nothing good would come of you. He did not understand this himself, for he thought that | was learned, and that if | did not have a challenge, | would become proud and hopeful. But | accepted it, as Paul says in 2 Cor. 12:7: "| have been given a stake in the flesh, that | should not exalt myself to high revelation"; therefore | received it as a word and voice of the Holy Spirit. 

| was very pious in the papacy, since | was a monk, and yet so sad and distressed. 


1) Cf. § 30 of this Cap. / 


often reproaches me: Oh, how many people you have seduced with your teaching! Sometimes | am comforted and my heart is again troubled by a bad word in my temptation. Once my confessor said to me, because | always brought foolish sin before him: "You are a fool, God is not angry with you, but you are angry with Him; God is not angry with you, but you are angry with Him. A precious, great and glorious word, which he said before this light of the gospel. 

Therefore, whoever is afflicted with the spirit of sadness, let him take the greatest care and see to it that he is not alone. 2) For God created the society in the church, and commanded the brotherhood, that its members should hold themselves together; as the Scripture says: "Woe to the man who is alone; for if he falls, he has not one to help him up," Eccl. 4:10. Also, God does not like the sadness of the heart, although He allows worldly sadness: but He does not want me to be sad against Him; as He says: "I have no pleasure in the death of the sinner," 2c., Ezek. 33:11; item: "Rejoice in the Lord," Phil. 4:4. He will not have such a servant who does not think well of him. Even though | know this, | may change my mind a hundred times in one day, but | resist the devil. 

Sometimes | hold up the pope to him and say, "What is your pope, if you make it so great that | should celebrate him? Behold, what abomination hath he wrought, and hath not ceased this day. So | hold before me forgiveness of sins and Christ; but | reproach Satan and set before him the abomination of the pope: so then is the abominatio and the abomination so great that | become courageous over it and freely confess that the abomination of the pope, after Christ, is my greatest comfort. Therefore, these are unholy fools who say that the pope should be

816 Cap. 26. of challenges do not scold. Only quickly scolded, and especially when the devil challenges you with the Justification. He often attacks me with an argument that is not worth a damn, but | do not see it in the torment and challenge; but when | am recovered, | see it finely. 

Well, the poisonous spirit does us much harm: but because we have and keep the doctrine pure, it shall not harm us; but if the doctrine falls, or is counterfeited, we are done for. But praise be to God, who has given us the Word and has sent His only Son to die for us. He did not do it in vain, so we should have some hope and believe that we are holy and blessed. If he has so accepted the thief on the cross, and Paul after so many blasphemies and persecutions, we have no reason to doubt. And indeed, we must all thus come to blessedness, like the thief and Paul. Dear God, what do you mean that He gave His only Son? For this reason he also sets apart all other good things that he has. For this reason we have no reason to fear his wrath, and yet we must fear it for the sake of the old Adam, who cannot grasp it as he might. And if we had only the first three words in faith, "| believe in God the Father," they are far beyond our understanding. 


54. challenging Satan. 


(This § is an excerpt from the "Tréstlichen Unterricht," Walch, St. Louis edition, Theil X, Col. 1780 ff, A 2-18.) 


(55) Those who are in trouble and weak should take care that they are not alone. (This § ibid. Walch, St. Louis ed., vol. X, 1786 ff. 8s 24-32.) 


(56) Which is the greatest challenge. 


On 14 Decembris Anno 1541 spoke D. M. Luther: The greatest challenge of the devil is that he says: God is hostile to sinners: you are a sinner; therefore God is hostile to you 2c. One feels this temptation differently from the other. He reproaches me for not having 


. § 53-56. 817 Sin, which | did in my youth, as especially among others, that | kept mass 1) and sacrificed and martyred God's Son, and thereby blasphemed Him: but many other things, which are nowhere equal to these; others he reproaches for what they did before in their lives. 

But in this syllogism and conclusion, the major, the first part, is to be denied, namely: it is not true that God is hostile to sinners. If then the devil says against this, and holds up Sodom and other examples of divine wrath to you, hold him up against it again before Christ, the Son of God, whom he made man for the sake of sins. If he were hostile to sinners, would he not have sent his Son for our sake, and not let him be miserably executed, tortured, suffer and die? But he is hostile to those sinners who think they are pious and righteous; that is, those who do not recognize themselves as sinners, whom he will neither hear nor see until they come to the right knowledge of their sins and hold to Christ alone by faith in the word. 

Such trials are very useful, good and necessary for us, and do not happen, as is thought, because we should be corrupted and lost by them, but rather be instructed and taught. For every Christian should remember and know that he cannot rightly learn or know Christ without trial and the cross, which is the school by which one rightly learns to know the man and the Savior. Twenty years ago | first felt this despair and challenge of divine wrath. Before that | had peace of mind that | also took a wife; | had such good days. But after that it came again. 

When | complained about it to D. Staupitzen, he said: He would never have felt nor experienced such temptations; but as far as | understand and realize, he said, they are more necessary to you than food and drink. Therefore, let those who feel them get used to them and learn to bear them, for this is true Christianity. If Satan had not tormented and exercised me so, | would not have been so hostile to him, | would not have been able to

818 Cap. 26. of challenges. § 56-58. 819 


Nor can we do so much harm. For when the challenge comes, | cannot overcome even a few, daily, smallest sins; therefore, it keeps us from hope, and at the same time increases the knowledge of Christ and God's gifts. For from the time | began to be challenged, God gave me this glorious victory, that | overcame monasticism and the shameful, cursed, blasohemous life that is in it. 

And how should our Lord God do it differently? Because Pope and Emperor cannot restrain me, there must be a devil who assails me, so that God's power may be known, and so that | may not grow weary and perish without enemies. St. Peter has a fine saying in 1 Ep. 5:9, where he says: "And know that the same afflictions pass over your brethren in the world,” that we are not alone, but suffer much in the world from time to time, the same ones with us whom we do not know. Yet we are not left desolate, but our victory remains, that we may overcome and succumb, for we have forgiveness of sins. Therefore, those who feel our sin have no reason to fear us, but those who do not feel it may well fear them. Everything depends on it, that we, who are frightened before, do not accept the hard, terrible sayings, nor the terrible examples, because only the consolation belongs to us. 


57. the most difficult thoughts of the devil. (The first two paragraphs Cordatus No. 357 and 358.) 


The most difficult temptations are when the devil brings this into our temptations, that we search for the causes of well-being and unhappiness, why it goes well with me and badly with you, why this or that happens. These temptations are very heavy and easily bring down. This is what he started in paradise with Eve and deceived Adam and all his descendants. 

There is no prouder thing on earth than a hopeful healer at the time of prosperity, and there has not yet been anyone among the saints who has not been troubled with the why, wherefore. 1) 


1) Another relation of what is contained in these two paragraphs in Cordatus No. 1412. 


Gerson writes that nothing can better avoid and drive away the devil's temptations and thoughts, which he gives you, than to despise him honestly. Just as if one despises a dog that barks in a hostile manner and passes by, it not only does not bite, but also stops barking. But if you provoke him with striking and throwing, he is likely to attack you and bite you and tear you to pieces. So the devil never ceases his temptations when he sees that you fear him and do not despise him, but you encourage and help him more and more. 


58: How Martin Luther visited and comforted a sick and challenged woman. 


Doctor Martin Luther visited a woman and comforted her, who had a great longing and desire for him. However, she had a serious illness in her and endured terrible paroxysms, which no physician could advise or help; for it was a pure evil work and unnatural thing and of terror and devil's ghost origin, because the devil in the form of a calf had pressed her, that she even fell into unconsciousness. Therefore she arrived afterwards for several days in great terror and trembling, so that she had four paroxysms, each of which lasted three or four hours, at which time she fell to the ground and died, so that she had to be resuscitated, fed and cooled, and became very ill, so that she could not breathe. Therefore she clasped her hands together and looked up to heaven with her eyes and sighed. Her hands and feet were so crooked because of the spasm, as if they were horns, and in addition they were very cold, and her tongue was dry and parched. Also, her body was lifted up by the disease and fell down again. When she was very ill, she opened her eyes, which were as if she were drunk with sleep, and said, "Oh, how heavily | have borne; take this great stone from me. And as she thus spake, she saw Martin Luther standing before her bed. Then she was very happy, got up and received him, and said, "Oh, my dear father! 


820 Cap. 26. of challenges. § 58. 59. 821 


in Christ, prayed to God for me, and fell back into bed, saying: | am still drunk asleep. 

Then said D. Martin Luther: Devil, God command you that you leave this divine creature and creature satisfied. And turning to those who had gone with him to this sick woman, he said, "She is afflicted in body by the devil, but her soul is blessed and preserved; therefore let us give thanks to God and pray for her. And he prayed aloud over her the Lord's Prayer, and concluded with these words: "O Lord God, heavenly Father, who hast called us and the sick to pray, we beseech thee through Jesus Christ, thy dear Son, that thou wouldest fatherly deliver this thy servant from her sickness and from the devil's bonds. Save, dear God, her soul, which you have purchased and saved from sin, death and the power of the devil, together with her body, through the shedding of the blood of your dear Son Jesus Christ. 1) Thereupon the sick woman said, Amen; and said to D. Luthern: Oh dear father, pray God for me, that | may abide in the Lord Christ, whom you have so faithfully preached to me: he is my only comfort and life. Even though he is now stumbling, he is doing it so that he may humble me, but not so that | may be saved again through this. But, O dear Lord Christ, grant patience and knowledge of my sins. 

Then Doctor Martin Luther comforted her with God's word and said: "She should recognize this fatherly will of God and command herself to him, for our Lord God used to nudge his little children so that their spirit would be blessed. Then the woman made a glorious Christian confession of her faith, and a beautiful thanksgiving, and said: | have been proud and hopeful, relying more on jewelry than on the word of God; the sermon went in one ear and out the other. But now | am in the right school, where God preaches to me. Therefore help, dear Lord God, for the sake of your Son. She spoke more such glorious words, and said, "When she is in the pa-

roxysmo, she felt nothing, she heard nothing; but only rested as in a deep sleep, and as if she carried a heavy burden; and when she came to herself again, she would be very tired in all her limbs. And when she had visited D. Luther the same day, she had good peace the following night, but after that the weakness had come again. But in the end she was mercifully delivered from it. 


59: Letter of consolation from Doctor Martin Luther to D. Benedict Pauli, whose son had fallen to his death. 2) (Cordatus No. 1690. 1691. 1692.) 


It is not forbidden in Scripture for a father to mourn his blessedly dead child, because the holy patriarchs also did this; only moderation must be kept, and a Christian also has comfort in his mourning, namely, that God reclaims the gift he has bestowed, as Job [had this comfort] when he says, "The LORD gave it, the LORD" 2c. 

He who rightly contrasts good and evil [sees that] he gains more than he lost, just like Job. Therefore, one must not focus on the existing evil, but on the many other gifts that God has left us until now. Even though the Son died, He [God] did not take away the knowledge of the Word; He left a good conscience, which is better than all good, for an evil conscience is true death and hell. 

When the children die, the parents must think that Abraham suffered much hardship, 


2) This § in Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 1565 to 1568, where another relation is found, which seems to be a translation of the Rebenstock text. (Rebenstock II, 2a.) With minor deviations from Rebenstock also in the Hall manuscript (Bindseil III, 206). Also in De Weites Briefen Vck, 218, where the same text is found as in Aurifaber's Tischreden, with the date 1538. Without date (After December 57). This date is incorrect, because none of Cordatus' speeches can be dated after 1537. Most likely, it is not a consolation writing, but a consolation speech, which therefore does not belong in the collection of letters. The reason for this was that the nine-year-old son of the mayor Benedict Pauli in Wittenberg had fallen down from the roof while removing sparrows’ nests. - Cf. Cap. 13, § 34. 


822 Cap. 26. of challenges. § 59-61. 823 


because he was commanded to kill his own son, and Jacob, [who thought] his son was torn by a wild beast, and David, because he was driven away by his son. Furthermore, this is a certain comfort to the parents, that it was God's good will that the child should die. Whoever holds another against them is the devil. 


60. consolation to L. Ambrosium Bernd of Jiiterbock, to whom his wife, children and mother in One week had died. 1) 


(Cordatus No. 615. 615a. 615b. 616.) 


| comforted a magister, who had lost his mother, wife and children in one week, as much as | could, saying: God's mercy in our misfortunes is much greater than all our misfortunes. You have cause for sadness, but it is nothing, there is a good sugar in this vinegar. Your wife 2c. is very well off, for she is already living with Christ. Have taken a leap from this misery into eternal life. Oh, that | had already gone through this leap, | would not long for it again. 

Do not look at the vinegar alone, let the sugar also count for something. Behold also other calamities full of vinegar where there is no sugar, as in the downfall of Zwingli, Minzers 2c. Thy afflictions are only bodily, namely otopyai guayai [natural affections]. Your wife has well died, leaving you nothing but the fondest memory of her intercourse and obedience. Be comforted by this; by this affection show thyself to be a kind and pious husband, and do not forget her. 

You are a very good dialecticus, you teach 


1) This § in De Wette VI, 189 ff. in the excerpt, "from 606. 187. 4° Ootb." - According to the superscription, it is Mag. Ambrosius Berndt from Juterbock to whom this consolation was addressed. He studied in Wittenberg since 1520 and became a master of philosophy in 1528. In the summer of 1537 he administered the decanate of the philosophical faculty and died in 1542. In 1538 he married Luther's niece Lene Kaufmann in second marriage. All these colloquia fall into the year 1532, therefore the death of Berndt's first wife will probably also fall into this year. (Wrampelmeyer.) Therefore also the date of the letter to Ambr. Berndt in De Wette, VI, 195 f.: "After May 1, 1538", is incorrect. 


Now practice this art publicly and explain well, distinguish, summarize, learn to distinguish the spiritual from the physical. Let the sugar also be something. Compare other misfortunes with your misfortune, then you will see that the death of your wife is not miserable in truth, but only in affection, because there are otopyal guoiyai. Therefore it is a memorable saying of Maximilian, who comforted King Philip, his son: you must get used. You will lose her many more who are dear to you. This is what those who have a noble, Christian spirit must do; nothing else will come of it. For the devil, who is the author of death and error, does not cease to work his wickedness on Christians. But he does not prosper; that is why Christ was under his hands, that he might destroy his dominion and overcome the author of death. For the devil is the author of death, God himself does not kill. For if Christ killed, who would run to him for help? For this is not the business of God, but of the sinner. When he takes away his hand, the devil eats us up. He inflicts death, of which God is not the author. Our death is indeed the will of God, but he has no desire for it. In short, God and the devil are opposed to each other. Everything that God does, He does so that it may be, but Satan does so that it may not be. Therefore, the devil is the author of death, a liar and a murderer, that is his craft. 

We cannot make the world pious, Master Hans must draw it. Therefore, Emperor Carl does right, who also kills the murderers again and spares none. 


61. comfort for a sick afflicted person. 


Anno 36, the 18th of July, after the sermon, D. M. Luther went to an honest, pious matron. M. Luther went to an honest, pious matron, who had been driven from Leipzig: who, because her husband had drowned, was in such distress and heartache that she also fell ill over it and fainted fifteen times in one night. When the doctor came, she received him kindly and said, "Oh, my dear doctor, how do | deserve it for you? D. Martin ant 


824 


Waited and said, "It is long deserved; Christ Jesus with his blood has done and deserved much more. 

Then he asked her: How was she, how was she doing? He admonished her that she wanted to please God's will and bear it with patience, as he chastised her as a father, whom he had previously redeemed from the greatest evil, from Satan and the abominations of the papacy. Dear daughter, he said, be content, and suffer the father's chastisement, be it for life or for death, as it pleases the dear God; for we are the Lord's, we live or die; as he himself says: "I live, and you also shall live", Jn. 14, 19. He has sent you a noble treasure to suffer, he will give you that you may bear it with patience, therefore pray diligently. To this she answered very Christianly: She would be well satisfied, God would ever weep well and fatherly with her, would also give her patience and help her bear such a cross 2c. So the doctor parted from her, blessed her and entrusted her to the protection of our dear God. 


Another consolation of D. M. Luther to a sick woman. 


In 36, August 4, Luther visited Hohendorff, 1) mayoress of Wittenberg, in sickness, and said to her: "My dear godparents, you should have patience and gladly bear the will of God, which is good and holy; for the body that has sinned must suffer and die. But we have the comfort and advantage of handing over our dear soul to the one who redeemed it. The world does not have this consolation. 


How M. Luther comforted the old master Lucas Kranach, painter at Wittenberg, since his son John had died in Italy. 

Anno 1536, the first Decembris, D. M. Luther visited the mayor Lucas, painter, who was very sad and distressed about his dear obedient son's departure, so with the

825 


He died in Bononia 2) on the 9th day of October, in the evening, in a beautiful, glorious, Christian confession. But the parents, beyond their natural love and inclination, were also tormented and tortured in conscience, as if they had been a cause of his death, because they had sent him into it. 

Thereupon spoke D. M. Luther said, "If it were true, | would be as high a cause as you, for | have faithfully advised you and him. But we did not do it in the opinion that he should die. Our conscience gives us witness that you would much rather have him alive, yes, much rather storm yourselves, and lose all your goods. Therefore put down this thorn in your conscience, for both heart and will bear much different witness to how you feel about your son. 

Then he turned to his father, who was weeping, and said: "Dear Master Luke, be still, God wants to break your will, because he likes to attack you when it hurts him the most, to kill our old Adam. And even though we do not have the greatest temptations, ours, which we feel, hurt us the most. Remember dear Adam, what a sorrow of heart it was when the first two brothers murdered each other in his presence. Remember dear David, who wept two whole years over his firstborn son Amnon, when Absalom stabbed him to death, 2 Sam. 13. Then, when he found Absalom stabbed to death in his sins, hanging on the tree, there was a wailing: when he saw his son eternally damned, there was weeping and anguish, 2 Sam. 18. for one. 

On the other hand, we should be comforted by his piety and obedience. For the world is so wicked and rude nowadays that even the very finest young men come to shame and sin: this could also have happened to your son, for you see how naughty and desolate the world is, that one may sin freely and do everything in denial, so that even in public sins and misdeeds one may impudently say, "My no!

is as much as your yes. 1) And said, first of all, about the desert life of our students. After that he said of a master at Erfurt, who had been a learned and pious man, but after that, when he became a priest, he fell into adultery with a stone-breaker's wife, who was ugly enough, but could not leave her: finally, one day, early at six o'clock, after he had taken mass, he went to the wife, and was seized by the man and stabbed. That is a terrible death. | also have five children, who are dear to me; but when | think of the evil courses of the future time, in which they might also turn out badly; when | think of it, | wish that they had all died, for there is little improvement to be hoped for in the world; as before my eyes. 

Thirdly, although it is painful that you had a pious, obedient son, for one can ever forget the evil, disobedient ones before the pious and faithful ones; let his obedience and Christian farewell be a joy to you, for he has received a good, blessed little hour, brought to him by God. Oh, blessed and blessed is he who comes well with the hour: it is my daily sighing and pleading that God grant me a blessed, happy hour, then | will have been well here and, delivered from all misery and sorrow, will be happy with God. 

To the fourth: Dear Master Luke, command this to God, the highest Father, who has more right to your son than you do: for you are only his physical father, have nurtured and nourished him only for a time, but God has given him body and soul, has protected and preserved him until now, is much, much closer father than you are, who knows and can preserve, care for and nourish him much better than you and the whole world. 

Fifth: Make a measure of hardship and mourning, forget it always cleanly, command it to God's will, which is better than ours! Your son is well pleased...

happen. Eat and drink, refresh yourselves, and do not grieve so, for you shall serve more people: But sadness and sorrow dry up the legs. 


64. comfort for a sick person. 


In Torgau, Luther visited a clerk who was a pious, diligent man and was sick with dropsy. He comforted him that he should be unconcerned about this illness of his, that he should not trouble himself with sadness, but should keep to the doctors’ rule, so that God's blessing would not be hindered by sorrow and heartache. For, as they say, good courage is half the body; when the heart is glad, there is no need for the body. And that he should keep himself according to the counsel of St. Peter, and commit his soul to the faithful Creator. We should die gladly, he said, for we have lived enough, only that we must live a while longer for the sake of others. 


65. of D. M. Luther's illness, how he comforted himself. (Lauterbach, July 17, 1538, p. 98.) 


When Luther was still seriously ill on July 17, he noticed a change in his pulse. The doctor comforted him. He replied: | surrender to the will of GOD; to Him | have surrendered completely. He will do it well. | know for certain that he will not die (John 11:25), because he is the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in him will live, even if he dies. Therefore | let him have his way. 


66. another comfort for a sick person. 


Doctor Martin Luther even visited an honest matron who was lying very ill, and comforted her thus: "Muhme Lene, do you also know me, and do you hear me? And when she understood and knew him, he said to her, "Your faith rests entirely on the Lord Christ. And he said unto her, The same is the resurrection, and the life. You will not lack anything, 2) you will not die, but like the Lord you will live. 


2) So Stangwald instead of "grant". 


828 


You will fall asleep in a cradle, and when the dawn rises, you will rise again and live forever. Then said she, O yes; and the doctor asked her, saying, Have ye no temptations? No, she said. How, then, do you not suffer? Yes," she said, "my heart aches. Then he said, "The Lord will soon deliver you from all evil, and you shall not die. And he turned to us, and said, O how good is he, for this is not death, but sleep. And straightway he went alone to the window, and prayed; and departed from her again about twelve past noon: and in the evening about seven she gently fell asleep in Christ.

68. consolation Against the challenge of oversight. (Cordatus No. 1705. 1706. 1707.) 


If the justified have peace, then those who do not have peace are not justified. Whoever should be thus challenged should know that the Christian life or righteousness moves in the midst of sorrow, trouble, tribulation and death. But they are God's children who suffer such things, according to this, "My son, do not slight the chastening of the Lord," Ebr. [12:5J So if they are children, they are not neglected by God, even though they are very severely afflicted by the devil, and because of God's good will toward them, it behooves them to be joyful in the midst of the afflictions, even because of the good conscience of faith [it behooves them to be joyful], through faith. 

The peace of faith, of which Paul says [Phil. 4, 7J, is higher than all reason, in such a way that it must also be there in death, in which nothing is seen less than peace. The flesh and the senses do not know it, but feel the struggle and the unrest. Thus David complains [Ps. 38, 4.]: That there is no peace in his 


Cap. 26. of challenges. § 66-69. 


829 


Even Christ on the cross did not feel peace, and if a Christian did not feel the same, to what should the promises and consolations of the gospel refer? Likewise the preaching of grace, such as [Matth. 11, 5.]: "The poor have the gospel preached to them", [Luc. 12, 32. "Fear not, little host", [Rom. 14, 1,:] "Receive the weak in faith", [2 Cor. 13, 11.:] "Comfort one another", and many similar words], which are mainly spoken and written for such people. 

Christians always have tribulations and feel sadness. That is why the first commandment is given, so that the sad and afflicted may be comforted. Would that they would accept the consolations! 


69. how to overcome the challenge of the accident. (Cordatus No. 784. 785.) 


The challenge of misunderstanding is like a very great fire and the wind that blows into it, because the more someone disputes about it, the more he despairs. God hates this disputation so much that He has instituted the Word and the Sacraments against it, so that we should hear that and look to this: | am baptized and believe in Jesus Christ, what do | care whether | am baptized or not? He has laid a foundation for us to stand on, Jesus Christ, and has made him a ladder for us to climb to heaven. 

The only way and the door to the Father according to the will of God is Christ, so we want to build above the roof in the name of the devil with contempt for the foundation, therefore we must also fall. If only we could believe the promises that God has spoken them, and look to Him [who speaks], then we would esteem this word great. 1) But since the world regards them almost less than the words of men, they are the same to us as if a cow had bleated.

How to comfort those who are challenged in their faith, D. M. Luther. (This § is taken from Luther's letter to Dr. Wenc. Link, dated July 14, 1528. Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. X, col. 1535-1537, § 10-§ 16.-In Cordatus No. 361 and 362 an excerpt from this. Cf. 


De Wette III, 349. the letter to Wenceslaus Link is again in Walch's old edition, vol. XVII, 2697 ff.). 


The devil's most noble challenge. (Cordatus No. 502. No. 1428.) 


The devil holds up the law to the conscience and Christ as a judge, and thus says: God hates sinners because he is righteous, but you are a sinner, so 2c. Thus he strikes down the conscience. Who could well distinguish and say: He hates not all but the ungodly sinners, and the penitent and 


But he makes the weak sinner blessed, because it is a twofold sin, as well as a [twofold] righteousness. 

Turning one's thoughts away from temptation is the best remedy against it, that is, one must think of Venice, the land of sleeping monkeys and similar things, but one must stop at prayer and adhere to some text from the Word of God. 


Other people's admonitions comfort you in times of trial. 


D. Luther said: "When he was in trouble, he would often have been comforted by a word he had heard from a good friend. For when, in 1535, the University of Wittenberg was transferred to Jena for the sake of the dying process, and | was quite distressed and sad about something, Doctor Pommer said to me: "Our Lord God is undoubtedly thinking in heaven: What more should | do with this man? | have given him so many wonderful, great gifts, and he still wants to despair of my grace. These words were a great and glorious comfort to me, and they remained firmly in my heart, as if an angel had spoken them to me from heaven itself; although Doctor Pommer did not think at the time that he wanted to give me any comfort with his speech. 


74 A different one from the accident. 


One should beware with all diligence of the disputation of the dispensation, for thereby a man is brought by Satan to disregard God's word and the sacraments, to consider Christ more a cruel tyrant and executioner or cane-master than a savior; He even abolishes Christ's office and custom, and makes us forget God, so that the whole service of God, which consists in praying and giving thanks, is extinguished and perishes, and nothing else but blasphemies prevail and are multiplied. 

Therefore, against this disputation, take the word, in which you have revealed God as He has revealed Himself and depicted Himself correctly, and recognize the great good deed of Christ, that for your sake He came down from heaven to give you 


832 


He became a good man and your brother, yes, flesh and blood, took all your sin upon himself, paid enough for it, and paid the Father for you with his bitter suffering and death, rose again from death, overcame death, the devil and hell, and took them captive through his ascension, all for your good. This is a great unspeakable love that God the Father has for you, that He did not spare His only begotten Son, but gave Himself to death for you. Let no other thoughts lead you away from this, but remain with Christ, lying in the bosom of his mother, or hanging on the cross. 


(75) That one should not argue about the accident. 1) (Cordatus No. 812.) 


The disputation of the verse is to be completely avoided, and Staupitz said: If you want to disputate about the verse, then start at the wounds of Christ, and it will cease. If you continue to argue about them, you will lose Christ, the Word, the Sacraments and everything 2c. | forget everything that is Christ and God when | get into these thoughts, and come to think that God is evil. We must remain in the word in which GOD is revealed to us and blessedness is offered if we believe Him. But in the thought of the transgression we forget God, and the laudate [praise] ceases, and the blasphemate [blasphemy] begins. But in Christ all treasures are hidden [Col. 2, 3.], without him all are closed. Therefore, one must simply deny the argument of misappropriation. 


76. benefit of the sayings of the accident. 


The sayings about misfortune, which have the appearance of frightening us, are only intended to do this and serve to show us the weakness of our strength and inability, and to admonish us to pray. If we do this, we are provided. 

But since one wants to argue and say: He who is provided, pleases God. 


1) Cf. cap. 2, § 84. 


Cap. 26. of challenges. § 74-78. 


833 


David is provided for; therefore he has not done wrong nor sinned. Answer: It is not our duty to judge according to what we have seen, but according to God's word, which is revealed and condemns evil works. For a godly and right pious Christian is not idle, but good works are only testimonies and fruits of our believing heart, yes, a newborn man is guilty and obligated to do what God has commanded. 


77 Cause of the oversight. 


The reason why God calls this one or that one is not to be put on our Lord God, but on man; he is to be blamed, not God. For the promises are universal, given and promised to all men, no one excepted, be he who he will, without distinction. Now God wants all men to be saved; therefore the guilt is not of our Lord God, who promises and will faithfully and surely keep what he promises, but of our own who do not want to believe it. 


78. beginning in thought of the accident. 


In the disputation of the verse it is useful and best to start at the bottom of Christ, so one finds and hears the Father; for all those who started at the top have fallen down the neck. So | once heard from Carlstadt in a disputation about the verse, that he said: If that should be, it would be just as much run into hell as carried into it. And M. Eisleben once went forth with these words: | am worried that it will rain dirt. And Muenzer, when we reproached him with this saying of St. Paul, Rom. 8, 30: "Whom he hath before ordained and called, them also hath he justified, them also hath he glorified," said he: "| know your sayings well. Therefore they fought hard in the disputation, because no one wanted to believe in Christ: and God says of the Lord: "Him you shall hear", Matth. 17, 5. 

Thus Christ says: "No one comes to the Father except through me"; but they do not want Christ and his word. As Muenzer also said (that God would forgive him): "If Christ did not want to speak to me, | would have him speak to me.

is stronger than a thousand worlds, too weak, and yet they want to be alone. Christ also did not like to be alone, which we know from the fact that when he was sad, he said, "You leave me alone," John 16:32. But even so he does not want to be alone, because he says that the Father is with him, with whom he comforts himself alone. 1) 


What harm loneliness brings. (This concern is Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 179," No. XII.) 


Sadness is the instrument of the devil. (Cordatus No. 1067.) 

The deeper someone is in sadness and passions, the more suitable a tool of the devil he is. For our passions are the tools through which he enters us and is effective in us if we are not careful. Where it is wet, one may easily water, and where the fence is evil, one may easily get over. So the devil has easy access where there is sadness. Therefore, one must pray and deal with godly people. 


84. sadness and bloody sweat of the Lord Christ in the garden. 


One does not find in any Historiis gentium that a man would have been so very distressed that he would have sweated blood. Therefore it is a wonderful history. No man can understand what the bloody sweat is, and that the Dominus Gratiae et irae, vitae et mortis should be so weak and so highly afflicted that he must seek solatium from the poor disciples, and say: Oh, dear, do not sleep, yet awake, yet talk with one another, so that | may hear that people are around me. That is right, as the 8th Psalm, v. 6, says: Minuisti eum paululum ab angelis, Ebr. 2, 7; but the sins of the whole world press him thus, and drive out his sweat. Against this he will have prayed: Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me, nec in ira tua corripias me, Ps. 6, 2. He drew out the heavy psalm, and many words will have fallen in the long prayer.

86 Doctor Luther's Weakness. 


Doctor M. Luther once fell ill during communion in the church at Wittenberg, and as he was leaving the church, he said on the way: "Yesterday | was fine, today it is completely reversed; it is the mutatio aeris". People are the best and most natural mathematicians; they soon feel it in their bodies and limbs when there is a conjunction, opposition, or change in the weather in the sky and the stars. Thus the devil is such a companion, he can soon cause diseases; as St. Peter says in the stories of the apostles that the diseases are Vincula Diaboli. And although God has ordained many medicines for one disease alone, and the same is often used, yet it works nothing; for the devil is so powerful, he can change medicines and apothecaries, and put dust in the boxes. Therefore we should have recourse to the right and true physician Christ, and ask him that when the hour comes that is to strangle us, as it must be one day, that he will give us a happy end. 


How Luther comforted a sick woman. 


Doctor Luther once visited a sick woman of nobility in Wittenberg, called the Selbitzin, and comforted her thus, saying: "It has taken far too long, if we only now in the last need want to learn to recognize Christ. He came to us in baptism and was with us, and has already made a bridge for us, so that we can go on it 2) from this life through death into that life; you should certainly believe this.

845 





1. the image of the Antichrist. (Cordatus No. 1354. 1355.) 


The body of the Antichrist is at the same time the pope and the Turk, because the body consists of body and soul. The spirit of the Antichrist is the pope, his flesh is the Turk, who attacks the church physically, but the latter spiritually. But both are from One Lord, the Teusel, since the pope is a liar and the Turk is a murderer. Bring the Antichrist into one and you will find both [namely lying and murdering] in the pope. 

But as the Church from the beginning remained victorious over the holiness of the Jews and the power of the Romans, so she is still victorious today and will always remain so against the hypocrites, that is, against the pope, and against the power of the Turk and the emperor. Let us only pray. 


2nd Interpretation by D. Luther's interpretation of the prophecy of the prophet Daniel, Cap. 11, v. 36, 37, about the Antichrist. 


(Cordatus No. 1409. 40. 1676. 1441.) 


The passage in Daniel [11, 37]: "And he will not respect his fathers God" 2c. is a certain description of the Antichrist. He will not respect God, thatis, religion, love of women, that is, the world regiment and the household. For by woman is meant procreation; he who despises this despises all men. Whoever disgraces preachers and women will not fare well. The same means: they despise all [people] and everything on earth, the office of teaching and the position of procreation; he [the Antichrist] despises God and people. 

Daniel said that the Antichrist will respect neither God's nor women's love, i.e. the pope will have neither God nor a legitimate wife, he will despise religion, the world regime and the household. Because the woman is, so to speak, before the household. Thus, the whole world government is for the sake of the woman, and to raise offspring through the woman. And this means that the Antichrist will despise the laws, the orders, statutes, all rights, good customs, 


He will despise kings, princes, rulers, and all that is in heaven and on earth, and will only lift up his little feet. 

Daniel was a mighty prophet whom Christ loved, and he spoke most accurately about Christ and the Antichrist, that he would reign between two seas at Constantinople, but the place is not holy and he does not worship the god Maosie (sic!) in such a way, nor does he forbid marriage. He also says [Dan. 11, 45.] to be abandoned by his lord. This is already the case with the kings who fall away from him. Therefore only believe that the pope is the antichrist. 1) 

The Turk and the pope are not different in the form of religion and differ from each other only in words and ceremonies. The Turk holds his own ceremonies and those of Moses, but the priest holds ceremonies that are partly Christian and partly those that sprout from his own brain, but of both they claim that they serve the worship of God and the forgiveness of sins, and just as the Turk acts against the ablutions of Moses, so the priest acts against baptism and the sacrament. And just as the former does not remain with Moses, so the latter does not remain pure with Christ. 


(The following is omitted because contained in Cap. 75, § 1.) 


3. that the pope is a living devil in disguise. 


| believe, said D. Martinus, that the Pope is a disguised and incarnate devil, because he is the end- Christ. For as Christ is a true natural God and man, so also the Antichrist is a devil incarnate. Therefore, it is true that the Pope is said to be an earthly god, who is neither pure God nor pure man, but a mixture of two natures; an earthly god, that is, a god of this world. 

But why does he call himself an earthly god? as if the right one were some and all. 


1) The meaning of this paragraph: Daniel's prophecy of the Antichrist is not to be drawn on the Turk but on the pope, Constantinople is not a holy place, the Turk has not the mass 2c.

It is indeed an and thundered, waging war by the power and might of abominable great wrath of God of the kingdom of others; as Daniel says, that he was mighty, but not by Pabst, namely an abomination of desolation, who his own power and might; as is now learned.

4, Bon Pabst Julio the Other. 


The Conversation of Pope Julio the Other is a finely funny poem, and at the same time true in itself, and well worth that one does not let it perish, but keeps and reads it diligently for and for. For it describes with splendid, magnificent words the papacy, especially in Julio, who before others has been a horrible, mighty beast of wonder, even a godless man, a cruel raging king and aggressive warrior, who has been allowed to undertake, dare and submit to everything, so that he might be an earthly 


which no emperor with the sword and force would have been able to do, nor to bring about. For the devil throws on knives and into scabbards; but when he is struck with the word of God, the pope becomes a chrysalis and a death flower, 1) that is, such a flower that goes out with the sun in the morning and sets again with it, like the same gele flower, from which a stubby, bald monk emerges in the evening. 


5) From where the Roman bishop got the name, that he is called Papa, Pabst. 2) 


When Martin was asked, "Where did the Roman bishop come to be called Pabst? He said: "| do not know of any reason to indicate where he got such a name, unless it came from a little word by reversing the letters, as if he were a father of fathers. For example, among the ancients, bishops were called Papa, as Jerome Augustine, who was bishop of Hippo, writes: the holy one; who was less than Jerome. And in the legend of Cyprian, who was a martyr in the Church before Jerome, it is said that the

Now it happened about the time he had become pope that he held mass unknowingly in a chapel in Rome, which was called Jerusalem; there the devils came flying frequently. When he asked what the name of the chapel was, and when it was revealed to him, he remembered the pact and alliance with the devil, confessed it publicly, and ordered that, immediately after the mass had been said, he should be sent to a small church.

He hoped that he would still be saved, because the ravens had taken the body away, and because they had left the heart there. Which happened, because he had repented, and (as they say) atoned with such death and done enough. 


19. many martyrs lie in Rome. 


In Rome, said D. Martinus, in St. Calixti Church, lie buried 176,000 holy bodies, and 45 popes, martyrs; they lie under the ground cramped; the same place they are called 

the cave. 

Item: In Rome | have seen in a large alley, which goes straight to St. Peter's Cathedral, a pope publicly carved in a stone, like a woman with a scepter, papal cloak, carrying a child on her arm; no pope passes through the same alley, so that he may not see such an image. 

For a woman named Agnes, who was a native of Mainz, was led by a cardinal to England as a boy and finally brought to Rome. There she was elected pope by the cardinals, but she was disgraced and it was

Then a cardinal answered: Because we are masters over the rights, we are also masters over the Priscianum and the Grammatica,; and in the Concilio all three popes were deposed and the fourth mentioned. But Pope John, who had handed over the papacy, thinking that he hoped that he would be elected pope again, died of sorrow when it did not happen: likewise Benedictus; Peter remained stiff-necked. 

Pope John was rejected because of his many evil deeds and tricks, because he had murdered his father and sold the bishoprics 2c.

| have heard this, said Martinus, for certain in Rome. So they did it: therefore their wickedness was ripe to be put to shame. And it is unheard of that Pope Leo held a council in our time, in which it was first decided that one should believe in the resurrection of the dead, 1) and that no cardinal should have more than five little hairs and little boys. 

Summa, no one shall be pope, unless he is a cunning, surpassing rogue and villain. The bishop of N. N. should be made pope at the next election, he deceives country and people. The Duke of B. is said to have said: "The bishop of N. N. buys a lot of cloth for the pope.

22) Whether Peter was the first pope, and how the goods, land and people came to him. 


All histories say that Peter was the first pope of Rome; but it is all a sham. After him, Lucius, Cletus and Clemens are said to have been there at one time, ruling one after the other. For at that time the church was still very small and thin, and these three preached in vain 2) houses among pious Christians, like deacons; not publicly, they did not rebuke the authorities. After that, the emperors gave them privileges, mainly for this reason: for the emperors had found from experience that Italy would not let itself be ruled by them, because the whales cannot suffer a head, nor have peace among themselves; therefore the emperors handed it over to the bishops of Rome, who all ruled well, except for Pope Hildebrand, the rogue, who fell to the whales and paid the Germans with ingratitude. For the first fifteen emperors, eight of them of the tribe of Emperor Carl the Great, and seven of Germans and Franks, were pious and were able to conquer the whales. Now, however, they have a right stick at the Carolo, which can finely pattern them with the Spaniards and teach mores. 


23. from Pope Hadrian and an English cardinal. 


Pope Hadrian was demanded to the papacy by Emperor Carolo, whose preceptor he had been, but he did not reign long, for he was of lowly lineage, the son of a burgher of Louvain. In England there was a cardinal, the son of a butcher, to whom a jester once said: "God be praised that we have such a cardinal: if he now becomes pope, we will be allowed to eat meat during fasting and on other forbidden days; for St. Peter, as a fisherman, forbade eating meat, so that he would sell his fish at a higher price; but this butcher's son will keep over the meat, so that he will make money out of it. 


2) So Stangwald instead of "vain". 


858 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, 8 Jan. 1538, p. 4. 1) 

On January 8, Luther mentioned Pope Hadrian, who exalted his praiseworthy actions when he held his triumphal procession in Italy. Therefore, two cities were painted on a tablet, one his father city, the other Leuven, where he had been graduated. [At the first one] was written: | have planted. The second city boasted: | have watered. Then the emperor's image above these cities answered: | have given the flourishing; because he had chosen him to be the pope. Someone who came along mockingly wrote on it: Here God has done nothing. 


24 The pope is the most diligent. (Contained in Cap. 54, § 27.) 


25. the papists' blindness. 


(Here are 12 heals omitted, an entrance brid by Aurifaber to the following). 


(Lauterbach, May 26, 1538, p. 86.) 

Luther: Cochlaeus denies the power of the pope from the gift of Constantine, but claims to prove it from the Gospel by this argument: 'Every governor has full power of his prince; Peter or the pope is the governor of Christ, therefore he has the same power.’ He proves this from the passage: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” (Matth. 28, 18.) To this must be answered: Peter is the governor on earth, not in heaven, because Christ says (Matth. 16, 19.): "What you bind on earth you throw." He does not say: what thou bindest about heaven. For He says to Peter, Follow Me, feed My sheep; | have come to serve; My kingdom is not of this world, that is: obtained by human powers. (Joh. 17, 19. 18, 36.) Therefore the pope is a red 2) Jew, who only praises the physical in Christ, as they say: Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho. [The rock gave to Peter, Peter gave the crown to Rudolph. 


1) In Cap. 44, § 21 at the end, in the section which we have omitted, Aurifaber incorrectly says that the city of Utrecht had the triumphal arch made, but Lauterbach that Hadrian had the panel painted when he held his triumphal procession in Italy. 

2) ie. a Turk, because they are said to come from Edom. (Gen. 25, 30.) (Seidemann.) 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 23-28. 


859 


Rudolph also dared to do it fresh, like Bonifacius the Eighth. The conversation of Julius has the chaff very well waffled, that is, the fable of the gift of Constantine, only that people did not dare to say it. 


How long the papacy shall last and stand. (Lauterbach, Oct. 13, 1538, p. 150.) 

In the decrees [of the pope] many and indeed very good passages are taken from the fathers and inserted, but the pope robs them of their prestige and determines the right for himself alone, and so he goes along in the name of God and rules, and his kingdom shall last 666 3) years according to the number of the beast, as John says (Revelation 13, 18.). For the heartache began soon after Gregory the First. After that the Constantinopolitan bishop and the one at Rome quarreled about the primacy until Carl the Great, when the Roman pope appeared, who became a lord over all kings. 


27. painting of the pabst's godless nature and tyranny. 


In very old books, several figures and paintings of the pope have been found, in which his deceitfulness, impiety, godlessness, idolatry and tyranny are depicted, because some people saw his great evil, but were not allowed to protest against it; they only secretly showed it with figures and pictures, so that one could notice and understand it. How some of these were found in Nuremberg and elsewhere and went out in print. 


28 How and by what means the papacy has grown and prospered. 

After the persecution in the Church ceased, the popes soon grabbed the reigns, out of honor and avarice. The first one was Hildebrand, or Hdéllebrand. After that they frightened all people with the ban. For the ban was such a terrible thing that it also affected the children, even the servants had to take the ban upon themselves. Just as 


3) Original: 660.

The pope's deceptions and practices, in turn, were very friendly and sweetly received, through which they sought great favor and the people's approval: they promised and praised the forgiveness of all sins, even the greatest and most serious ones. If someone had weakened the Virgin Mary or crucified Christ, the pope could forgive it if he only gave money. This majesty and power of the Pope was disgraced and taken away from him by God through my pen, said Father: for he made everything out of nothing, and can disgrace everything out of nothing. 


29. the case of the pope. 


The papacy, he said in 1539, must again take the blame and pay. For instance, only the life and the abuse were attacked, that the pope and his people led such a wickedly shameful life; now, however, we are attacking his doctrine and the essence and the foundation on which it stands with all our might. He is also eaten by monks, his lice and his own creatures. That is why Campey, the Cardinal, rightly said: "The great innumerable multitude of monks causes great misfortune and does much evil, namely disrupts and dissolves the most beautiful monarchy of the papacy, which is established with great counsel and concern. 

I think his prophecy is fulfilled, that the rat king will be paid by his own people. Theology cannot defend him nor protect him; for the canonists, his jurors and jurors, may well presume to protect him somewhat, out of long custom, that the papacy has so long stood and been in use, but it is of no avail. For the custom that applies to rights should be in accordance with reason and fairness; it is even a cold argument. He went on to say, "Oh, dear God, what is the pope to judge, since he neither knows nor understands anything about business? He is a foreign judge who knows nothing about cases that take place in the world and in the home. That is why he has judged and spoken so foolishly in matrimonial matters, which marriage state he has forbidden his scribes, since he has ordered it to be held as a sacrament. Since marriage would be a sacrament, then 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 28-30. 


861 


they should not be with the pagans, because the sacraments do not concern the unbelieving pagans. We in the church do not want to have anything to do with matrimonial matters, for as far as conscience is concerned, 1) to instruct it; for they are vain worldly affairs and do not concern the jurisdiction of the church, and do not belong in its jurisdiction and judgment seat. 


30 What overthrew the papacy. 


The pope is now rightly and justly oppressed and plagued, because he has gone against God's word. For if he had only confessed twenty-one years ago that some had sinned and done wrong under the title and name of the church, or had only done too much, and had ordered the Elector of Saxony 2c. and me to be silent, with the offer that he wanted to reform his own 2c., and had condemned corners and heresies, and only left me satisfied; it would not have come so far: but he wanted to defend himself, flashed and thundered. Then the truth burst out, so that even the papists themselves are not all satisfied with the pope. So it goes, for against the Lord no counsel helps. Now Philippi books, in which the most noble articles of our Christian doctrine are briefly, neatly and finely written, are also coming into French-speaking countries, and the adversaries are accepting them. Must therefore be plagued more by his own people and princes than by us. Now he acts as if he does not care about money, always lets them accept it, if only he can maintain his authority and reputation: he intends to get it all back in time. 

We, however, grab him by the throat, because we challenge his highest authority and doctrine: to it we rush in, and make him equal to the other bishops. | did not do that in the first place. Just as John Huss only punished the abuses and lives of the pope and his smeared ones. Although the Cardinal of Camers, in his book of vespers, attacked and overawed the pope enough and publicly disputes the pope's violence in Paris. 


1) The same statement Cap. 43, § 83. 


862 


31. the pabst's violence and practices. 


Before that time, the pope was very proud and hopeful, despising everyone, as Cajetanus the Cardinal, his legate at Augsburg, said to me: What do you mean that the pope asks for Germany? The smallest finger of the pope is stronger and more powerful than all the princes in Germany. But now, because he sees that the emperor does not fight for him, he flees the concilium, makes him a quandary between the emperor and the French, without which two he cannot be nor exist in this discord. For when the emperor has died, the Frenchman will be able to attack and take the empire, as he had almost five votes of the princes in the last election. If they abandon him, he will call upon the Turk, king in Persia, yes, the devil in hell himself, whom he has a parte, ante and before him, and on his side. He does not hand over the quarrel with the Emperor and the French, but keeps it with the two one, and is neutral, carries on both armpits. 

After that he said about the unspeakable wickedness of the pope: As one, who had been notary Rota 1) in Rome for nine years, had publicly confessed that only the grossest lies and vile things were acted outwardly, in the same court; but inwardly, in the Pabst's chamber, in the narrow council, atrocious practices and intrigues were carried out against kings and protesting estates. 

Pope Julius the Other has ever well solved, who rebelled against God and man in the most hopeful way; so that he held a terrible, great, miserable battle with the French early on Easter Day, in which much blood was shed and many good people perished and remained dead; as has been reported above 2) once already. Even though the French kept the field and the victory, it was with great bloodshed and heartache, because he lost his best men, since the pope hoped that he would certainly prevail and keep the field. 


1) Perhaps Liborius, licentiate at Magdeburg. Cf. Kummer p. 372. (Lauterbach p. 9.) Cf. Tischreden Cap. 77, § 1. 2) In z 10 of this Cap. 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 31. 32. 


863 


After that he blasohemed God in heaven. For when the message came to him that his people were defeated, and he sat and prayed his Horas Canonicas, he took the book and threw it against God's ground, saying: "Be now French in all the devils' names, Sancte Sui- cere, ora pro nobis. And so it happened, for he turned Emperor Maximilian away from the French by fraud and practices, and was weakened by the Swiss, after he had taken such a great damage in the same battle. 

He read a beautiful mass to the devil on Easter Day, when twenty thousand Christians perished. Oh, what should the boys fight for the church, who do not care about the church, but that they get a lot of money and property, land and kingdoms, that is their greatest concern. If he could bring it about this very day, so that he might preserve his authority, he would gladly do so. 

| hope that God's judicial process against the pope and his people will continue as it has begun, because the first three petitions in the Lord's Prayer are mostly against him: let the pope's name be blasphemed and cursed, let his kingdom be destroyed and fall, let his will be disgraced and hindered. | do not hope that there will be more monks and nuns. If his feet are cut off, he must crawl, because in 3) the length cannot be so. 


The Pabst's wickedness and evilness cannot be sufficiently explained in words. 


| would like to attack the pope's canons and decrees, the pope's patched coat. There is neither a name nor a swearword that could be used to call the pope hostile enough, as he is well worth it. Even if one calls him stingy, godless, idolatrous, it is still all too little. One cannot obtain nor excuse his great tricks. Therefore Christ denounces him in one word and calls him an "abomination of desolation standing in the holy place" (Matth. 24, 15). And St. Peter paints it finely and paints it with strange and peculiar colors. 


3) The word "in" is missing from the outputs. 


864 


Likewise St. Paul calls him 2 Thess. 2, 4. an "abominable man, who exalts himself above all that is called God". Daniel also pointed it out, and says Cap. 11, 36. 37.: He will become the most honorable, and will not respect the God of his fathers. 

We have read and re-read this before, and yet understood nothing of it. But now, because such an abomination is shown to us, both in God's word and with experience, we become so spiteful that | get such thoughts about it, which | do not like, namely, that this knowledge of the word will fall again, and the brigh light of the gospel will go out. For the gospel clear| says that Christ will come at midnight, when there wil be no day nor light. 













The pope is not an authority nor a primate in the church. 


The Pope cannot have the primacy, nor be th supreme head in Christendom, for it is impossible tha he could visit and govern all the churches if he wer Elias, Elisaeus, Peter or Paul. 


34. question. 


If the emperor gave to the pope his right to proclai and appoint a concilium, should he (the pope) also b obeyed? D. Martinus answered: The emperor, as verbum personale and ordinary authority, does no have the power to hand over to the pope, as a verb impersonali (who is not an authority). For the pope i such a person or thing, like an interest that stands o no ground or immovable good. Nor would it be translation, a transfer of power from the emperor to th pope, but rather a devastation; for if the empero transferred his power and authority to the pope, h would diminish and devastate the empire. Now however, he has neither power nor right to do so, fo the empire is not his own, nor does he inherit it. 

Summa, if one denies that the pope is an authorit (as he is not), then everything is taken away from him For what he 


1) Thus Stangwald. In the editions: "to describe". 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 32-35. 


865 


He did not have it by right, but stole and robbed it. Therefore it is nothing to say that the emperor got the empire from the pope, because he could not give him what he never had. For Carolus Magnus gave nothing to the pope, nor did he concede anything, as they falsely boast; but, since he had ruled up to the eighth rank, even without the pope, Heinricus, Duke of Saxony, called the Birdman, was elected emperor, and ruled up to the fourth rank, without which emperor's foreknowledge and will no pope was elected. But under Emperor Henry the Fourth, things changed; for since his father, Emperor Henry the Third, had decreed that no bishop should be elected without the prior knowledge and approval of the Emperor, Pope Hellbrand could not stand this, and 2) with Pope Gregory the Seventh, he caused all misfortune; since that time, things have gone as one has seen and experienced. So it goes in the world. 


35. the pabst's goods. (Cordatus No. 1476. 1477. 1478.) 


To the one who asks whether Constantine's donation is true, | answer: it is fictitious. But | have read that Constantine distributed many things among the poor and appointed bishops to them, who finally became lords. He did not give them land and cities. And the whole world wonders where the pope got such a great dominion. 

The popes were formerly not lords of the emperors, but were preserved by the emperors. For Lothar, Duke of Saxony and Emperor, bought the right of election from them; for it was a perpetual war in the election. Finally, however, they took this right again by fraud and caused that they would be confirmers of the emperors. This happened first with the election of Carl the Great, whom they elected emperor in such a way that he had the right of succession for his heirs. At 


2) Because Hildebrand and Pope Gregory VII are one and the same person, Henry IV is the subject of this sentence. Otherwise, this sentence would have to be changed to: "has as pope Gregory the Seventh" 2c. - Bindseil Ill, 244 has the same reading as Aurifaber. 


866 


The emperorship remained with them for a while, but when there were no more descendants, the popes assumed the right to vote. 

After that came the Emperor Otto, who appointed seven Electors, put an end to the war, otherwise there would have been a constant dispute with the Popes. 


The Pabstthum is stolen property. (Cordatus No. 643.) 


1) The papacy is vainly stolen property, and must be stolen again, for it is of no use to any custom of the church, nor of the world regiment. This is what they learned under Ferdinand. 


37. Constantini Donation. 


Emperor Constantius’ donation is a great lie, by which the pope arrogates to himself and wants to have half of the Roman Empire. And even if it were true, it would not have been in the emperor's power, he would not have had the power to forgive; it is also not due to the pope, according to the saying of Christ: "But not you" 2c., Luc. 22, 26. 


38 The Pabst's Ascent. 


Aristotle says that the course of nature is very slow in the beginning, but very fast in the end, and tends to fall. So the papacy has risen to the highest level these fifteen years. Thirty years ago, no priest was allowed to have two fiefs or benefices that did not suffer from each other; now, however, they have innumerable many, and a bishop now has three bishoprics. 


39. the pabst's pomp with his newly made cardinals, and how god will have blessed. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: "That the Pope would have made thirty cardinals in one day, to whom many thousand horsemen would have gone beyond the Tiber with great pomp, they would have shot with many rifles,’ received most gloriously. Then came our Lord 


1) Cf. Cap. 56, § 4. 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 35-40. 


867 


God also with thunder and lightning, so that they were all terrified, so that in one church the child of God's mother had fallen from her arms (as Pasquillus writes) and had gone to heaven, lest [it] also be made a cardinal. 

On the same day, a priest had lost the blessed host over the altar where he was celebrating mass, and had spilled the chalice from fright and sorrow, and the pope had cried out loudly that one of the same cardinals would become a pestilence and poison of the Roman See. This happened shortly before the gospel was revealed and brought to light. 


(The following Cordatus No. 790.) 


When my first theses were presented to the pope, he is said to have said: This was written by a drunken German. He will change his mind about indulgences when he sobers up. In the same way, all others despised me in the beginning with haughty pride. 


40) How Gerson attacked the papacy. 


In 1542, M. Luther said: "You do not know in what great darkness we are under the papacy. Gerson 2) was the best, who only began to attack the pope, although he was not yet sure where he was in it; however, he came to find the distinction in hac Quaestione: Utrum in omnibus sit obtemperandum potestati Papae. And said: Non esse peccatum mortale, non obtemperare. And still hung on: si non fieret ex contemptu. He was not allowed to consider that he had even made the rupture; however, he was somewhat comforting to the people, that is why they called him Doctorem consolatorum. But he was also condemned by the pope as a heretic and put under ban. That is why Cardinal Cajetanus also called me a Gersonist at the Imperial Diet in 1518, 3) since | appealed to the pope for a Christian free concilium. 


2) On Gerson, compare the note in Walch. St. Louis edition, vol. X, Col. 1751. 3) Cf. z 154 of this Cap. 


868 


And whoever wants to blame me for having yielded too much to the pope at first, let him see what darkness | was still in at that time. Those who have not been in the papacy consider the teaching and warning of the Antichrist completely unnecessary; but those who have been in it consider it necessary that the youth be diligently reminded of it. 


The first chapter of Saint Paul to the Romans. 


| believe that St. Paul described a register of great, horrible sins and disgraces Rom. 1, 21. ff. more prophetically than historically. Now it is fulfilled in Rom. The pope does not make so many cardinals in vain. Each one has an annual income of thirty thousand florins, which he gives for the pallium, so that the pope may be confirmed and strengthened by the money and prestige of the cardinals! Therefore Daniel says Cap. 11, 36: "The king shall reign according to all his pleasure and will. 

(From here to end of § at Lauterbach, Sept. 26. 

1538, S. 135.) 

The course of the Evangelii in Denmark and England. On September 26, letters arrived from Denmark and England in which many good things were reported about the course of the Gospel: In Denmark, the king is establishing both the churches and the university in the best godly order; in England, the papists have been overcome in many disputations; everything is united against the private mass and the marriage of priests; these continue to exist only weakly; rather, everyone can go out freely from the monasteries; the pilgrimages to the saints are being eradicated. Oh, St. Thomas with his golden shoe suffers misery. Luther replied: "Since the Cardinal was expelled from England, the foundation of the papacy has been violated, for the Cardinals are the cornerstones of the papacy in every nation, just as we have four Cardinals in Germany, so also France and Spain. So confident is the pope in his holiness and power even today that he despises even the highest God, however much he is debilitated and revealed with his godlessness. How great is the blindness of the 


Cap. 27, Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 40-43. 


869 


People who conceded everything to the pope, that he could do whatever he wanted! Clement made Hippolytus a cardinal, who had 60,000 ducats in cash every year, even though he was only a private person, holding no office or rule. Wasn't that an appalling tyranny? Finally, they suppressed and usurped everything, and the wretched people believed everything of their prestige, so that they worshipped Pope Clement as the most holy, who was a godless, hypocritical villain, a son of his sister, unbaptized and a man of war. 


42. of the pabst's evil wiles. 

New newspapers were written to England in 1539 about how the pope had corrupted the king's most secret and inner councillors and bribed them with money so that they should secretly kill the king as a renegade Mameluke; the kingdom promised them. For one of them was the king's blood friend, who was always at his side. And the pope boasted that he was an heir to the kingdom, because it was his fiefdom, and therefore he was justified in doing so; but when such a secret plot was revealed, they were captured and beheaded. 


43. the pabst is a table or belly servant. (Cordatus No. 50.) 

After the pope ceased to be a teacher, he became a table servant, which all his decrees testify. In these he does not deal with theological matters; having become a belly servant, he is zealous about three things. First, that he does everything to strengthen his rule; second, that he incites kings and princes to each other by the greatest hatred, as often as he wants to harm one of the great ones. In this he is obviously wicked. Thirdly, he plays the devil most secretly with great zeal, since, as if he were benevolent, he dissolves the hatred that he had aroused among them shortly before. And he does not do this until he has achieved what he wanted. Furthermore, that he perverts the truth of the Word of God, he does not do this as a pope, but as the Antichrist and the true opponent of God. 


870 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst, § 44-49. 


871 





44, the pope is a devil. 1) (Cordatus No. 183.) 


According to the real devil, the pope is in truth a devil, which is easily proven by this Clement, because he is evil, since he is an Italian; and even more evil he is, because he is a Florentine; the most evil he is, because he is a bastard. Add some more evil if you can. 


The hatred of the Pabst and his followers against the gospel is unceasing. 


The hatred of Pabst and all his followers, the papists, against the gospel does not cease, nor can it be reconciled, which has burned from the beginning of the world and cannot be quenched. For even those at Babel did not cease, but cried out for and for: Away with you always. In the same way, the Jews did not stop raging against Christ and the apostles until they were exterminated. So do the papists today; they strive day and night more to exterminate the Lutherans than to resist and ward off the Turk. Therefore, let us be courageous and pray, said D. Martinus. 


46. from the papist practices. (Lauterbach, June 28, 1538, p. 92.) 


On June 28, Luther said a lot about the treachery of the papists, who were hoping for the emperor's arrival and were gathering money from the monasteries and bishoprics everywhere and were recruiting soldiers, pretending that it was for the sake of the Turk. They want to attack us secretly on all sides. As the bishop of Mainz said: It is still about a small, and did not want to leave Mainz to be closer to the emperor. But the attack has fallen. God protected with his angels. Ps. 2. the pious pray. The counsels of the wise come to naught. 


47 The Papists' Blindness. (Lauterbach, Sept. 26, 1538, p. 136.) 


When our Lord God wants to punish someone, He makes him blind to God's 


1) Cf. § 10 of this Cap. 


Word completely despised. The papists are of this kind today, who make the confession for us that our teaching is the word of God, but they cannot admit the conclusion, against their conscience: When God speaks, He must be heard; God speaks the teaching of the Gospel; therefore you must hear. They answer: He must not be heard, but the Church must be heard. It is truly a strange conclusion that they allow the two prefixes and yet do not want the conclusion. But so they break through, as it is written in the decree of the Council of Constance: Even if Christ, who is the truth, said it, it would not be contrary to this that custom is to be kept as a law. So one must solvate the arguments if one wants to be right. If this is not the sin of the Antichrist against the Holy Spirit, then | do not know how to define this sin, because they are now sinning knowingly and willingly and are defending the sin against the most tangible truth of the Word of God in the most stubborn way. Who, | pray you, would not resist the devil here, the most impudent liar? | am not surprised that John Huss, even though he stood alone, died so joyfully when he heard such great ungodliness of the papists. 


48 Of the Pabst's Treachery. (Contained in Cap. 54, 8 6.) 


49 Pabst's Fall in Our Time. 


It is a very great miracle at this time that the pope's majesty has fallen, that several parts. For this all monarchs, emperors, kings, princes and lords had to fear and tremble: not one of them was allowed to do even the slightest thing nor to make a fuss against the pope, who only frightened them all with a wave anda finger and drove them in. The same God is now fallen that all monks are also hostile to him; although he is their patron, protector, even creator and God, and they his creature. But that they still hold above him, they do so for the sake of their enjoyment, otherwise they would be much more fierce and evil against him than we are. His wickedness and

But mischievousness is now even apparent, because it is on the day that he sent out 120,000 crowns 1) to order murder burners. 


50. the pabst's crown. (Cordatus No. 607 and 606.) 


| saw in Italy the whole suit of the pope ina monastery, but it was only a bishop's cap [infula]. Therefore, | said to a monk if this was the crown of the pope. He answered: O no, and he said that his crown was triple, which he called "the empire of the world" (that is a fatal name), and the whole of Germany could hardly pay for it. He is said to have pierced the emperor in Bologna with stones and jewels. 

All Italians surpass the Germans in pomp, speed or agility and finesse, and by games and gestures they can move the people watching them to do whatever they want. 


The pope is not the head of the church. 


The pope is not the head of the Christian church, otherwise the church would be a beast with two heads, since Christ alone is its head, as St. Paul says. The pope is the head of the false and devilish church. 


Collation or comparison of the Pabst with the bird cuckoo. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: "The cuckoo has the nature and manner to suck the warbler's eggs and lays its eggs in the nest, so that the warbler has to hatch them; then, when the young cuckoos have crawled out of the shell and are big, the warbler cannot cover them, so the cuckoos become leprous, and finally the young cuckoos eat their mother, the warbler. After that, the cuckoo does not like the nightingale, said D. Luther. The pope is the cuckoo, he eats the eggs of the church and shits out vain cardinals. After that he wants to eat his mother, the Christian church, in it. 


1) Thus in all editions. It should probably read: "suspended". 


If he is born and bred, a pious, Christian, righteous teacher cannot tolerate or suffer the catching, preaching, and teaching. 


The pope is the cuckoo, and the Christian church is the lark. 


Doctor Luther said in 1542: Where the lark is, there the cuckoo also likes to be, because he thinks he could sing a thousand times better than the lark. So also the pope sits down in the church, and there one must hear his singing, so that he overshouts the church. But just as the cuckoo is nevertheless useful, because it indicates that summer is near, so the pope also serves to announce to us that the last day is not far away. 


54. the papists' impenitence and obduracy. (Lauterbach, February 13, 1538, p. 27.) 


Afterwards Luther said of the frightening blindness of the papists, who run and rush to hell with earnestness. For they themselves see our just cause and innocence, they also admit that they are wrong, but they deliberately decide and counsel against us. They simply want us dead and do not want to mend their ways at all. But since they despair, they want to drag us down with them. But it will be an unequal course, they to hell, we to heaven. Therefore Paul rightly calls them dmndynyéres [Eph. 4, 19.] who have ended their pain, 2) who defend the recognized error and want to eradicate the truth. Never did Caiphas and the Pharisees hold the idea of righteousness from the law in such a way. For all heresies have the conviction of truth, but the papists have lost the thought of righteousness and conviction, condemn themselves and sin knowingly and _ intentionally against the Holy Spirit. They want to defend the public whore [as] a pure virgin. If the last day does not come, it will never come. | consider 


2) In the German Bible: "Which are nefarious". From the above speech we see that Luther could very well have translated more literally if he had wanted to. But he gives the sense incomparably more accurate and understandable in his translation. 


874 


Often at night in great distress and fear, how one could help them, so that they would repent and remain in good and honor. But it will not be. They themselves do not want to repent and simply thirst for our blood, as the bishop of Mainz is said to have said: What are you arguing about? We know well that we are wrong. And when the bishop of Salzburg negotiated with Philip, he gave a threefold way and manner of unification: First, if you Lutherans do what we want, you cannot do it. Second, if we follow your doctrine, we do not want to. Third, a treaty between the two parts is impossible, because neither gives way to the other. Therefore, one will destroy the other. You are weak and few, we are many and sure. | would never have believed that | should have experienced such words. God help us from troubles and from all evil. 1) 


God is hostile to the papacy. (Contained in Cap. 43, § 15.) 


56. the papists’ bloodthirstiness. 


Cardinal Campegius said in Augsburg in 1530: "Do you Germans want to withdraw from the Pope's yoke and not be subject to him? Well then, let us make Germany swim in blood. These are my thoughts, said D. Martinus, higher than we can attain, for the pope and Francis certainly have something in mind now. 


57) Who is the pope. 2) 


In the Pabst's and his soup-eater's books it is publicly stated what the Pabst is, namely, not only a man, but also God; that is, the Pabst is an earthly god, aman mixed with the Godhead. Yes, a real earthly god, like the devil, who has nothing heavenly. This argument was once brought up in a public theological disputation by a Doctor Juris, M. K. D. Wenzlaus Link answered and said: Yes, the pope is the god of the jurists, not of the theologians. 


1) For the conclusion of this section, cf. the other relation in Walch, old edition, Vol. XVI, Col. 2069, Z16. 

2) This § is most likely spurious, a combination of § 23 and § 27 of Chapter 54. 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 54-60. 


875 


The pope is the right Antichrist. 


That the Pope is the true anti-Christ, said D. Martinus, appears clear and public from the fact that those who transgress his statutes are punished much more severely than those who do against God's law, commandment and word. Thus the pope sits in the temple of God, yes, of the one who is preached and called God; that is, what concerns the service of God, over which he exalts himself and wants to be God. But he is not God according to the same essence, that is, he is not raised into heaven. That is why he is actually called the antichrist, because he sits in the temple and in the church of God, and exalts himself above everything that is called and is called God and worship. The Turk is not the Antichrist, for he is not and does not sit in the Church of God, but is an evil beast; but the Pope sits in the holy Church and arrogates to himself the service and honors that are due to God alone. For no one is an antichrist except God's Church. 


. The Ordination of Priests in the Papacy. 


In the papacy, priests were not ordained to preach the Word of God, but only to say mass and administer the sacrament. For when the bishop ordained them, he said: "Accept, | give you authority to say mass, to consecrate, and to sacrifice for the living and the dead. We ordain priests according to the command of Christ and St. Paul, namely, to preach the true, pure Gospel and Word of God. But they, the papists, do not think of anything in their ordination to the office of preaching, to teach God's word; therefore, their ordination is wrong and unjust; for all worship that is not ordered by God, nor established from and according to God's word and command, is good for nothing, indeed, it is vain idolatry. 


60. M. Luther's simplicity and lowly person harmed the pope. 


My simplicity and poor little person (I don't want to say just cause, said D. Martinus) did the damage to the pope. For there

And Christ says, "Petre, follow me, feed my lambs,” 63. that one should preach harshly against the pope. John 21:15, 19; does not say, | give you all authority in heaven and on earth. But now the pope wants to be Christ's governor and follow St. Peter's footsteps; and yet does not want to serve, but to be served, wants to be an earthly god and a god of this world, and to rule and reign over all kings, emperors, princes 2c. with great splendor, glory and power.

66 Of the Junker Pabst. (Lauterbach, Apr. 19, 1538, p. 64.) 


On April 19, a paper was brought on which a pope, a cardinal and a monk were described, whose image columns had been sent from Innsbruck. But Luther added [some] true, hostile plots and spoke with sobs: "Oh, who should be silent and have patience in the face of such great malice and recognized error! Whoever wants to honor the blood of Christ must rage against the pope who desecrates it. One cannot be enough of an enemy to this dragon of hell, especially those who truly love Christ. For now he sins knowingly, not out of error. What happens out of error is error, there is still hope. That is why | have added the seventh verse, which is spiteful enough: "| know and hold this for myself. By these words | strike his conscience. For he praises Christ and his gospel only because of the profit, means nothing sincerely. And this name: Bon christian is a mockery at Rome: Ah, a good fool. Ah, we should stay with the article: | believe in Jesus Christ. This one should be honored, thanked and praised, but through him the pope becomes a proud and glorious tyrant. The blood that Christ shed for our souls, the pope turns against our souls. Therefore Christ rightly cries out against them with terrible and harsh words, Matth. 23. And he read the whole chapter. Such a valediction would also be necessary now. 


The pope has a desire to get, therefore he hinders the concilium. 


Since there was talk about the Concilium 1) and how the pope was fleeing it, it would be best for the emperor, France and all of Germany to unanimously cite the pope to the Concilium, so that he would defend his teaching 2c. D. Martinus answered: "The pope does not allow this, and knows a way for it, so that the concilium is not promoted and has a continuation; therefore he does not allow the emperor and Francis to become one and to get along. And since 


1) Cf. Cap. 54, §26. 


If a concilium were to be held, no Protestant would come to it. Therefore, it would be a sin if a Christian is not heartily hostile to the prankster, the pope. 


68 Pabst's regiment is best for the world. (Cordatus No. 146.) 


The pope is without a doubt the best ruler for the world; for he knows so well the rule according to which the world is deceived, that he is also a lord of the fields, of the meadows, of the money, of our houses and of all things; likewise also of the bodies (which can be seen in his measuring monkeys, who ravish one virgin after the other and respectable women), and when he has thus arranged everything according to his lusts, then he gives the world eternal damnation as a reward. So the world wants to have 2). 


69. Pope Clement the Seventh’s attack against the Lutherans. 


I, said D. Martinus, "I also saw and noticed before the Diet of Augsburg that Pope Clement, a man of sins, has many plots. For since we know the devil and what he has in mind, how should we not also know his most beautiful member, whom he has on earth, and what he intends? But now this pope's most noble plot has been that he, through his deceitfulness and practices, has been able and driven the emperor to the point that he left Italy, since it was going well enough for him, and moved into Germany, and overtook and exterminated the Lutherans by his power. 


The Pabst's deception, how and from what he strikes coin. (Cordatus No. 45 and No. 1404.) 


The pope virtually beats the abundance out of all things in the world of money, only infant baptism excepted, because the little children are born naked and without money; otherwise he would not have spared them either. 

The princes make money out of metal, but the pope makes it out of all things, out of the mass,

(The following Cordatus No. 1740.) 


Oh that everyone who presides over the ministry of the Word had been in Rome and seen the Pabst's fair! 


The Pope's and the Cardinals’ court has corrupted their cause and promoted Doctor Luther's doctrine. 


The pope and his people relied on their great power, so they also overthrew themselves; for if they had handled things carefully, they would not have stormed, potz tausend fa mi re; quid non obtinuissent? But the papacy was to fall. When | moved against Rome, Rome was called Fontem Justitiae; but | saw that Ronl was a whore or whorehouse. Cardinal Campegius said in Augsburg in 1530: "Cardinal Cajetanus spoiled this thing in 1518, because he wanted to go through with his head. There one should have skilfully, with cunning and artificial grasps with the thing gone around. 

And said D. Luther: The pope is now overthrown in the German land, without still having some elders inside: this does not happen for the sake of his authority, but that some princes still protect him. For when Peter Paul Vergerius was the Pope's legate in the German lands in 1533, the ruffians, as the Pope's mother, almost threw him to death with dirt. After the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, Cardinal Campegius went to Vienna with King Ferdinando, where they made a little man from rags as a cardinal, and put him on a dog, which had the pope's letters of indulgence and seal hanging from its neck, and a pig's bladder with peas under its tail, and so the dog had to run through the streets of Vienna as a spectacle. The next day, the cardinal had a whore come to him at night, and she had stolen the cardinal's cross from him. This cardinal, because he was rich, was killed with poison by the son of the pope. 


76. agnus Dei. 


The Agnus Dei, as it was called, was worn before the Sacrament only once, because the pope was alive. In Pope Leo's time 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 74-78. 


It was consecrated when it was destroyed by fire and burned. This happened only because of a dispensation that Leo consecrated again. 


77 The Sanctuary. 


The bishop of M. boasted that he had a flame burning from the bush that Moses had seen. To the dark star at Compostel in Hispania is pointed the flag for a sanctuary, which Christ had in hell, likewise the crown of thorns, the holy cross, nails 2c. 


78. from the sanctuary of the donkey on which Christ rode on the day of the palm tree. (Lauterbach, May 9, 1538, p. 77.) 


On May 9, Frederick Mecum said a lot about the excessive pride of the Italians against the Germans and told an example of how a Mass priest in Rome had persuaded some Germans with sweet words in the confession of the ears: | have always known that the German nation is very God-fearing and loves religion, but the Italians are scoffers; he has a very great treasure, but hidden, [a] sanctuary. If he wanted to keep it secretly with him and give something for it, he would let him have it secretly for the great salvation of Germany, but on this condition that he should not reveal it to anyone in Italy, because the lives of both would be in danger. When he had promised with an oath, he gave him a thigh of Christ's donkey wrapped in silk. This is the sanctuary where the Lord Christ sat bodily on and touched the donkey's leg with his leg. He happily brought his secret treasure to Germany. When he reached the borders of Germany, he began to boast to his companions and finally came out with it and showed his treasure. Another was there, then a third, a fourth, who boasted of it, and that the gift was given to them on condition that they keep silent. When a fifth heard this, who also had one leg, he began to curse: Did the donkey have five feet? Luther answered: This was the glory of the Italians, to mock the barbaric Germans like this. But by God's grace, Germany feels and sees the wickedness and one can

In Orleans, France, there was a woman who, while still alive, ordered that if she died, no vigils or masses should be said for her, and she was buried in a monastery. Then the monks pretended that her spirit was dying, crying and weeping, and asked that masses be said for her, because she was in purgatory because of her sin. Finally, the fraud and deception were revealed by a boy, and [the monks] were expelled from the country by the king. In sum, the pope does not want to let up, but wants to be 

disgraced, and his lies are not human, but devilish. 


| believe, said D. Martinus, that the pope, out of special concern, has placed the feasts of St. Sylvester and St. Thomas Cantuariensis on the eighth day after the holy day of Christ and Christmas, because the former brought and won the English kingdom, and the latter the Roman kingdom for the pope. 

St. Thomas, the apostle, is nothing respected by the pope against St. Thomas of Cantuarias: 1) because the pope is most concerned that he may keep the goods, and when the empire is finished, he has always snatched the empire.

countless amounts of money have been made by daily chance? Now they become ungrateful, and they dare to deprive the godly not only of the incomes, but also of the substance and goods that are endowed for proper worship. 


84 Des Pabsts Geiz und Trendelmarkt. 


The pope takes annually in England from each one a petriniche, that is, two pennies, which has made nine times a hundred thousand florins. 

Many altarists had barely forty pennies annually, and were nevertheless able to maintain themselves abundantly from the accidentals and Kretzschmerei, vigils, soul and sacrificial masses. The parish of Wittenberg had hardly thirty guilders of money and income, and yet carried over three hundred guilders annually. The snowing in has been great. | know that the bishop of Mainz received two thousand florins annually, which he had from the Consistory, from fines for adultery and fornication. It actually belongs to the princes; if they were wise, they could get hold of such money. 


85 Of the Pope's Right. 


| also wanted to know the spiritual or ecclesiastical laws, said D. Martinus, and read Summam Angelicam. Then said D. H.: They should not be called angelic, but devilish, for the sake of the great superstition and sophistry, which is in there, so that no one can judge from it. So the pope, said D. M., with his cases, which he reserves for him in the shrine of his heart, has thus left them, that he has nevertheless reserved them for him. So all his rights are uncertain, so even he has vexed us with his devilish lies, under the appearance of key power. That is why St. Paul not unreasonably calls these times horrible times, when out of God's wrath the popes at Rome ruled by so many lying signs, needed their curtisan pieces. England was free, but St. Peter's pence brought the pope nine tons of gold annually. Yes, St. Peter describes the pope with very fierce and serious words 2. ep. 2, 3.: "There are (he says) 


sly people in avarice." He is not talking about bad and human avarice. 

Just look at what Pope Urban the Sixth, Gregory the Ninth and Boniface the Twelfth did before the Concilio at Costnitz. Although the Romanists were to acertain extent humiliated and frightened in the same Concilio, they regained their composure and became proud, just as they are now frightened again and driven to the chorus. Tetzel made it so crude that it had to be grasped. He wrote: "Indulgences would be a reconciliation between God and man, and that they would be useful, since a man would not repent without all remorse and suffering. 


Of the keys and pouches of the pope on which he hung. (Lauterbach, Feb. 17, 1538, p. 30.) 


On February 17, a picture was brought to him of the pope hanged with Judas and Judas' bag. He answered: "This will hurt the pope, who has been kissed by the emperor and kings on his knees, and will now be hanged on his keys. It will hurt the papists very much, because,their conscience will be hit and the matter will speak for itself. That is why the bag with the bishop's hat and Cardinalinful is very well armed, because there was such an incomprehensible and inscrutable, unheard-of avarice with the pope that he did not only seize the annates, the pallia 2c. of all countries, but also the sacraments, the indulgences, the brotherhood, the blood of Christ, the marriage. Therefore the bag is full of robbery, and rightly is he contradicted, as Revelation (18:6) says: "Pour ye in twofold." He has banished me and burned me and put me in the devil's butt, so | will hang him by his own key. 1) 


1) To this Stangwald makes the following remark: This painting was painted and printed by Doctor Martin Luther himself in Wittenberg in the year 45 with this title: Digna merces Papae Satanissimi et Cardinalium suorum (Well-deserved reward of the demonized pope and his cardinals). And under it set these rhymes: 

If the pope and the cardinal on earth are to be punished in time, you would have deserved blasphemy, as their right is painted here. 

Mart. Luther, D. 1545. 


888 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 87-91. 


889 





The first of these is a book on the subject of the "Pabst's Abominations in his Decrees. 


It is a great, terrible wrath of God: in so many of the pope's decrees, not a single saying of the Holy Scriptures or an article of the Catechismi is contained. For the pope wanted to arrange his church like an external worldly regime; therefore he blasphemously taught that a lousy monk's cap, 1) if put on a dead person, would bring forgiveness of sins, thus comparing it to the merits of Christ, the only Savior. This abominable idolatry and blasphemy was not only permitted by the pope, but also confirmed. 


88. from the papist idolatry force. 


The idolatry and superstition in the papacy has had great power and effect, because it has penetrated by force. That is why Daniel says of the Antichrist: "And he will succeed until the wrath is out," | hope that the same wrath is now out, that God will resist the pope, if only our own security and contempt of God's word will not promote such evil. 


The first of these is the "Bishop Benno's Idolatry and the Glory of the Papists”. 


When it was written by the visitators how Bishop Benno's idolatry in Meissen was destroyed, D. Martin said. Martin: Dear God, how the papists will now cry out and praise imperial foundations! For the bishops want to be princes of the empire: the emperor has even been forced to confirm and strengthen the papacy against himself. After that they took up the sword, like Pabst Julius. For when they had attained power and prestige, they laid aside the habit and the clerical garments and became princes and emperors; like the Cardinal of Salzburg and Mainz, they were the most powerful. But praise be to God, who lays his judgment upon them and against them, as the Scripture says. So the Lord will do to them as they thought to do to us. For | see their stubbornness, that the best people, as soon as they are elected bishops- 


1) Cf. cap. 30, § 30. 


and have sworn and done the law to the priest, they are hardened like Judas, for Satan leads into them when they have taken the dunked bite. 


90. of an official and his caplan. 


There was an official, said D. Martinus, who had a vicar and priest who said mass for him. The latter, because he had not said mass for a vain time, as he was ordered, his master was so angry with him that he wanted to remove him from office, so that he would give him twenty guilders. The priest was frightened and saddened, for he had no money, and asked him to give him a fortnight's respite, but he would raise the money. When the fourteen days were up and he had found another master, he bought two brooms and brought them to the official's house. What, said the official, do you bring brooms? Do you know that | asked for money? What more, said the priest, | have brought the two brooms, | will give one to you, and the other | will keep for myself, so that each man may turn in at his own door, and my master will not demand any money from me; and so he went away. 


The Papist Tyrants Rage Against Christ and His Word. (Except for the last paragraph Cordatus No, 1485, 1486.) 


The papists and tyrants may fall into the pit they are preparing for themselves, for we have humbled ourselves enough, suffered, our brothers have been burned 2c. They do not want to be advised, but God will defend His King, to whom He said [Ps. 110, 1.]: "Sit at My right hand." He has built him a high castle: if they shoot up with a rifle, he strikes down with thunder and lightning. 

The adversaries have innumerable, inconstant, and daily new advice. Always they cry out: [They] err, err, exterminate them. But it goes out at their neck. They will not be able to stay, but we have this single advice with God: the King Christ must stay. He has overthrown great kings; | would rather stay with him than with the Turk and our emperor.

He then leafed through a book printed under the papacy, in which all the bishoprics, monasteries, and annual expenditures and the simonia were described. He was amazed at the size of this empire and its destruction. 

This word, when God says: "Grow and multiply", Gen. 1, 28, God has not said to any monk, priest, pope, bishop; nor can they puff up their statutes, statutes and humanity so high that God's word is nothing compared to their clamor.

The first is the first of the two. 


Doctor Martin Luther said in 1541 that Pabst's kingdom had been a terrible blindness and wrath of God, which ruled and reigned in the world in such powerful errors and public lies that no man understood and noticed it; yet the Christian church had been so abundantly warned against it by the Lord Christ and the apostles. So there has never been a lack of people in the papacy who have had beautiful ingenia and great testimony of their art and skill. That is why | am often surprised that there has been so much darkness in the papacy. But | cannot judge myself from this, because by the saying of St. Paul, 2 Thess. 2, 11. 12. where it is written: "Because they did not believe the truth, God gave them strong errors. Therefore, the abomination and darkness of the Pabst could not have been greater. 

The pope has two pillars or foundations on which he stands; one is called: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven," Matth. 16, 19. Item, that the Lord Christ says to Petro: "Feed the people.

tualis), the pope's decree. This practicing church is above all others, as [the decree says]: Cuncta noverit mundus etc. [The whole world shall know]. [The whole world shall know.) Likewise [the Decret): Si Papa infinitas animas in mancipium gehennae duceret etc. [If a pope led innumerable souls into the bonds of hell). To them the answer is: Christ says (Matth. 28, 20.): "Teach them to keep all that | have commanded you." The pope's reputation has increased only because Peter and Paul were in Rome. By this excellent pretense, the Antichrist has taken over his empire, so that the emperor and the supreme Elector of the Palatinate have been forced to perform the service of a groom, have had to hold the reins and saddle of this beast. Therefore he was so proud that also a Cardinal at Augsburg said to me: What do you think that a Cardinal asks for Germany? Now he is forced to see that the greater part of Germany has fallen away, as well as England, Denmark, and that he is not respected by his own defenders. He is martyred by the spirit of the mouth (Job 15:30), but he will be destroyed by the coming of the Lord. Duke George, the excellent defender of the pope, wants to reform him. O how intolerable a word is: reformation; as the Cardinal of Piacenza said of the Bohemians at the Council of Florence: "Let the Bohemians, those beasts, eat and drink what they want; but that they want to reform us, that is not to be suffered; for if we give in to them in one article, then it is all over for our church. They will think [so]; and is also true. For they see the conclusion very well: if a single piece is wrong, the whole being, in its whole extension, will become wrong. For he who is once evil is thought to be always evil. That is why they, who are in possession, do not want to give way and defend the most obvious errors. Therefore, it is no wonder that Satan is angry with me, because he does not leave his church, but fights firmly for it, biting the heel of the pious, but Christ will crush his head. He must reign in the midst of his enemies, as the Papists, the Anabaptists and the raging sacramentalists. Therefore let us pray; it is

is not a minor matter, but Satan is angry. If a war should start in Germany, which God wants to prevent, then devastation will follow. 


The first is a new version of the original. (Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 171.) 


Of all the errors in the papacy, two were the most prominent, namely, one's own satisfaction and the fulfillment of the law, which contradict each other and also the merit of Christ. For when the conscience hears: The law must be fulfilled by perfect obedience; this you have not done; therefore do enough for it: then there has been a constant torture. But that monk in the battle of death did right, who at last broke through all the statutes of men, seized Christ's image, and said, What are my works and merits, and those of the whole world? | take hold of his merit and works [osculor] and trust in them. St. Paul has argued with the righteousness of the law against the people of God, as he also struggles with the strongest arguments in Romans 9, 10 and 11. It must have caused him much grief, so that he also wished to be banished for his brothers, that the joy must have been very strange to him, because he brought forward great, vehement speeches [instantias], [such as] (Rom. 9, 14.), where he speaks: "Is God then unjust, that He rejects His people?" 


The arguments of the papists are full of holes. (Lauterbach, Nov. 25, 1538, p. 181.) 


Because the papists have a bad cause, they try to defend themselves with the most erroneous arguments, which prove nothing. Therefore, their arguments are to be rejected altogether. The nature is this: All praise is an invocation; the saints are to be praised; therefore they must be invoked. | deny the upper proposition, because not every praise is an invocation. Likewise: Every act of concupiscence is illicit; the act of marriage is an act of concupiscence, thus. | ant, words on the sub-sentence: It is not an act of desire, but this sexual

The majority and largest house among the papists, especially in monasteries, have been very unlearned asses, some of whom have hardly been able to read properly.

At Bamberg, they annually assign for sanctuary a book in which Emperor Henry and his husband, Cunegund, are said to be described, since they both vowed to remain virgins. When Birkheimerus came there and took a fancy to see the book, what kind of contract they had made with each other, since they had contracted sponsalia. When he obtained this through great practices, the canons opened the book for him; it had been the Topica Ciceronis. It was such a cheating with them. Otherwise monks read in a monastery: Mumsimus for sumpsimus. When a young monk from the Grammatica punished them for it, the other fathers said: You young licker, do you want to punish us? so we have read Mumsimus for a long time, it should and must be called Mumsimus and remain so. 


Violence is the defense of the papists.

God deals with the papacy as he does in a dry summer, in which he lets the springs dry up, so all scholars in the papacy dry up. 

Rom, said D. Martinus, has learned people, but in the holy scripture one finds there big asses.

115 The Papists' Abomination. 


M. W. Calixt 1) told M. M. Luther a story about a disputation that had been held in Rome, in which he had been next to thirty magisters or more. There they had disputed the authority of the pope, who boasted that with his right hand he commanded the angels in heaven, but with his left hand he pulled souls out of purgatory, and that his person was mixed with the divinity. But he, Calixtus, would have disputed this, namely, that the Pope alone had the power to bind and loose on earth, Matth. 16, 19. And since they, the others, had vehemently disputed this, he would have decided that he had spoken it disputatorily, not that he certainly considered it so. M. Luther said: "That in many hundreds of years there has not been a papist bishop or priest, who has taken care of the poor schools, baptism and

Once, when two young people were reciting a comedy (or something like that) in front of Leo the Tenth about the immortality of the soul, and one of them claimed that it was immortal and the other that it was mortal, the holy father answered that the former was right, but the words of the latter made a happy face. This was the saying of this God of the earth, that the truth of the true God makes no one happy, but all sad. 

The Christian church should have such evil-doers and epicureans as rulers. Thus it was decided at the Concilio in Basel that the priests should wear long skirts down to the ankles, high shoes, wide plates, and no red or green dress: and one should not dispute whether the soul is mortal or immortal. 

The pope is a king without God and marriage. For what is divine he has taken away; then he has changed what God has ordered and established in the world, as, marriage.

and stood at eight hundred years. He was so holy, even superstitious, that he condemned a brother who had forgotten three florins, which he had not calculated in his office when he died, over the table and had such money thrown into the grave and thirty masses said to have delivered him from purgatory. O of the great abomination! 


Tetzel's ungodly boldness with his indulgences gave M. Luthern cause to write. 


Tetzel made it so crude, 4) that it had to be grasped, for he wrote and taught that the indulgence of the pope was the reconciliation between God and man. On the other hand, that the indulgence would nevertheless be strong and valid, since man would have neither newness nor sorrow, or would do penance. Yes, if one had impregnated the Virgin Mary, he could forgive him. He could also forgive the sin that one would be willing to commit in the future. Item: that the indulgence cross, which the pope would have erected, would be like the cross of the Lord Christ, and would have the same power 2c. Such and such abominations caused me to sit down and write against them, not for the sake of some man or money. 


The pope is a heretic, exalting himself above God's word. (Lauterbach, Feb. 24, 1538, p. 40.) 


Augustine and others make this distinction between a heretic, a schismatic, and a bad Christian: a heretic is one who deviates from the articles of faith; a schismatic is one who holds the same faith but disagrees because of some customs; a bad Christian is one who holds both but lives evil. They dare not call us heretics, but schismatics. But the pope is a heretic for me and | for him, because he is the opponent of Christ, and | the opponent of the pope (antipope). For he, the pope, unashamedly teaches that the priesthood of Christ is transferred to the governor of Christ, and thus denies the eternal priesthood of Christ.

910 Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 122-125. 911 


Just look at the two cuncta 105 of this chapter] in his decree, where he rises with great majesty above the authority of the Scriptures. In the interpretation of Scripture, he admits the Fathers, but when it comes to judging individual cases, he prefers the prestige of the apostolic chair, because he himself wants to be the Lord of Scripture, over whom no one is to judge. That is why he already flashes against me, also against his own canons. For he himself says: Custom shall give way to truth, in the 19th Distinction, and adds the example of King Hezekiah, who destroyed the bronze serpent (2 Kings 18:4). However, he does not follow this canon at all. For he does not want to give way to the truth in his countless, palpable errors. This is the most serious thing, that the youth does not see these errors, nor does he know them, nor does he think differently, as if it had always been so in the course of the Gospel. God led me strangely into the game of attacking the dragon, so that | disturbed monks and nuns and hanged the pope over it. If we had respected the word of God, those errors and idolatries would not have arisen. Let us, | beg you, follow this advice of God: "This is what you shall hear. (Matth. 17, 5.) Let us stay with the dear son and doctor. 


The Pabstical denies the power of godliness. 


The papacy has a beautiful, glittering worship, praises God's word, faith, Christ, sacrament, love, hope, etc., but denies the power of all this, teaches that it is radically contrary and alien. That is why St. Paul says in 2 Tim. 3, 5 that they "deny the power of godliness"; does not mean that they do not have godliness after their life, or that they deny godliness, but that they deny their power with false and superstitious teaching. 


The Roman church ship. 


D. Martinus showed a tablet on which was painted how the pope with his superstition and idolatry has betrayed the whole world; namely: the church little ship was full of monks and priests, who handed and threw 


The pope sat with the patriarchs, cardinals and bishops in the back of the ship, overshadowed and covered with the Holy Spirit, and looked toward heaven. This is a very old painting, conceived and poetized by a Pauline monk in Venice, which we have all believed to be an article of faith, indeed, against the Christian faith. 

So it was with the Veronica in Rome, which is only a black board hung with two silk cloths, since only one is taken away and shown. Thus, the people are persuaded with a fictitious picture, as if it were properly painted, and yet it is only a black panel, on which nothing is not written. So are the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul in Rome, carved in the courtyard of St. Peter's Cathedral, over which these verses are written against the morning and the exit of the sun: 


Ecclesiam pro mari rego, mihi climata mundi Sunt mare, scripturae retia, piscis homo. This is: The church | rule for the sea, The whole world is for the sea me. The holy scripture is the net of mine, there to fahn people to be the fish. 


This is Pabst's glory and triumph. 


The blasphemy of Tetzel and the ingratitude of the world. 

When Teizel's blasphemy was spoken of, and he spoke of his lies with splendid, pompous words, D. Martinus said: "We are in the utmost blindness and blasphemy. Martinus said: "We are stuck in extreme blindness and blasphemy; now, because we have been redeemed from this through the Gospel, by the pure grace of God, we are also ungrateful on our part, even full, provoking God to anger from both parts with horrible blasphemies and ingratitude. 

Oh, dear God, do not punish us according to our sins; help us to mend our ways. If then we are scolded and patronized for our ingratitude, let us easily recover from our loss; but our adversaries must be overthrown and fall to the ground, for they overdo it with their blasphemy.

The papists' spiritual state is a godless state, and yet they want to govern and reform the church. 


The papists boast that they are the Church and that the authority of the Council is with them; they want to have the power to assemble it, to recognize and conclude it, and they want to reform everything; since they have neither knowledge nor understanding of the Holy Scriptures, know less about them than a child, and are much worse than the Sadducees, 1) who, to some extent, kept a fine outward discipline and conduct; but these, the Papists, are utterly godless, blasohemers and sodomites, and still want to reform the church with outward ceremonies and customs: But if the doctrine is not reformed, it is in vain that one dares to reform the ceremonies and the life. . For superstition, superstition, and pretended holiness or hypocrisy cannot be known but by word and faith, since there are two kinds of holiness: one essential or internal, which is righteous in itself; the other accidental, or external, or hypocritical. So, St. Francis was righteous, essentially and inwardly holy, through faith in Jesus Christ, but after that he was deceived by outward and hypocritical holiness. It is neither a natural nor a formally accidental thing, but an abominable, unnatural monster. 

Oh, dear Lord God, shall we go to heaven with our clothes on, since we have to stay outside with this flesh, skin and hair, as it is now? We must not take on ourselves caps or ropes; we would have caps and orders enough, and enough to do, each in his profession and state: a preacher with his teaching; a magistrate with his governing; a schoolmaster with his teaching and instructing, to keep the boys in good discipline and obedience. Thus the whole world is filled with monks' caps, more than we can bear. My cap, which | now have to wear, has more than a hundred thousand folds; and so every man's profession weighs him down and weighs him down.

130 The fornication of the papists. 


Pope Paul the Third had a sister. Before he became pope, he gave her to the pope as a bridegroom, and thus earned that he was made a cardinal. Then he immediately left his wife and took her from him, for he was in wedlock and had begotten a son, who is now a cardinal. The popes have done such disgraceful deeds that go far beyond human thoughts. The priests had to give him, as a whore landlord, a florin from their cooks when they had a child, which was called a milk penny, and likewise a florin from the mother. And finally, all priests were allowed to have whores with them, without all shame and disgrace, from which they fled like the devil from incense. As it is also forbidden in the spiritual law. . 

| know of a city where the priests' cooks were held in great honor at weddings and in bathhouses, and they were called Frau Dechantin, Frau Prébstin, Frau Sangerin 2c. according to the offices their masters held. Therefore, D. Staupitz jokingly reproached the bishop of M[ainz], saying: He would be the greatest whoremaster in Germany, because no whoremaster, even in the richest house of muhmen, would not have more than fifty florins annually for interest, but he would have five hundred florins, and probably more. The bishop laughed and said, "Yes, that's how they pay the clerks in the chancellery. 

(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Sept. 12, 1538, p. 130.) 


A canon at Wuerzburg took away by force from a bridegroom his just married wife and said: "If it pleases you, allow it, then you shall have mercy on me, your Lord; but if not, then you must still suffer it. He replied, "These are sodomitical [sins] that cry out to heaven, as it is said in Genesis 6 (v. 2), "They took as wives whom they pleased,” nor did they shun blood relations. 


131. vain glory of the popes. 


What is it that the papists boast that they are the church § since they are the church's enemies?

and know nothing of the Holy Scriptures, much less understand them. Popes, cardinals, bishops have never read the Bible, it is alien to them, indeed, they are lazy, idle, rich guards, who rely on their power, consider and care for nothing less than God's will; as Erasmi's Dialogus by Pope Julio indicates. The Sadducees were much more pious than the Papists, who were outwardly pious; but the Papists are utterly godless, blasphemers and sodomites. Our dear Lord God protect us from their holiness. Let us pray against security, for out of it comes ingratitude, then contempt, soon blasphemy, and finally persecution. Thus the devil leads us to the utmost. 


132) When the article of the resurrection of the dead is to be believed in the papacy. 1) 


In the Lateran Council, which was held in the year after Christ's birth in 1515 during the life of Pope Julii and was completed after his death under Pope Leo, it was first recognized and decided that one should believe in the resurrection of the dead, and that a cardinal should have five boys as paramours and eunuchs; which, however, Pope Leo subsequently changed. There must be something behind it, from which a devastation will follow. Therefore let us pray; they will have to fall who still want to defend this.

with many signs and punishments, so that the people would live so without understanding that they would not become aware that the Antichrist was already reigning. Luther answered: They are fiction, but much agrees with Daniel. For the judgment of the pope is fire. He attacks with fire. The Turk strikes with sabers. The Antichrist punishes with fire and will be punished with fire according to the proverb: You have thirsted for blood, drink blood. The pope is already trembling and in a certain way he is excelling and cloaking the fox, because he himself is being gnawed by his defenders. Henry, the Duke of Brunswick, seizes the bishopric of Hildesheim, the emperor has invaded the two bishoprics of Liege sand] Frankstein, and the pope agrees. The pope has to suffer this and you will see even greater things, although the pope hopes for the end of the sickness attack and that he can flash against the invaders. 


135. of the pope's and his ignorance and blindness in the matters of god. (Lauterbach, March 27, 1538, p. 48.) 


Then Erasmus of Rotterdam was remembered, a very good and very learned man, who, however, having been corrupted by Venice and Rome, had turned to Epicurism, which he kept hidden. However, he praised the Arians more than the orthodox (Catholicos). For he dared to claim that Christ was called God only once in the whole New Testament, John 20 [v. 28]: "My Lord, and my God"; by concluding: "Behold, Christ is called God only once, more often man and son of man. If Christ were more often called God and Son of God, and not man, the Manichaeans would be given the opportunity. How should our Lord God do it?

This is what the Roman court and Epicurism set up. We also have in Germany a whole society of Epicurians: the Crotus, Mutianus,

Justus Menius. 1) In short, the Italians are nefarious and epicurean. No pope nor cardinal has read the Bible in six hundred years. They understand less of the Catechism than my little daughter. God protect us from such blindness and leave us his divine word. The papists realize their shame and fear their own conscience. They do not fear us because they take heart and say: Olim passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem. [Aen. I, 199.] [l.e. We have endured heavier things in the past, God will put an end to this thing too? The seizure will cease one day. Hence the saying arose among the papists: Peter's little ship sways, but it does not sink. But the heart has slipped away from them through their own conscience. They innocently strangled the pious Johannes Hus, who did not deviate from the papacy by the width of a nail. He only taught and plucked at life and morality; he sinned nothing against Pabstism, just as Christ committed nothing against the Pharisees and yet had to die. But now Johannes HuB must be smelled, according to the prophecy of Johannes Hilten in Eisenach, who is also killed in our time; he is said to have said while dying: Another will come and you will see him. That prophecy happened when | was a young man. In short, the perilous times are already here, as Paul laments, "For there will be a time" 2c. [Luther read the whole text and said: "When | read this passage, | thought of Turks and Jews and not of Rome, since he clearly tells us to go away from the pope and paints us the monks honestly.

136. Daniel's prophecy from the pope. 


Daniel, Cap. 12, 1.[11, 36.], has foretold of a tyrant, who "will want to be 


1) Seidemann: Cf. my references in Burkhardt p. 198 s. 


against the God of gods, and against everything that is called God", that is, against all divine order, and against all worship, and what is called God, whom we honor, and who is preached in the church. This is the right description of the pope, because he is against the church, the police and the household. He is against the church, the police and the household, against God's word, the authorities and the married state. 


The Papal Church is not the Christian Church. 


The Bishop of Mainz said: 2) | know that we have an unjust and evil thing, and that Luther's teaching is right, nevertheless we do not want to accept it. Likewise, the Cardinal of Salzburg, Bishop Lang, said: 3) We know and it is written in our consciences that it is right and just that the priests may become married, and that marriage is better than the abominable and shameful fornication practiced by the priests, but we do not want to change it; for the Emperor will not let Germany be disturbed for the sake of consciences. 

What is that different from despising God? They are devilish words. God, in turn, also mocks them; as we see that emperors, kings, princes and all imperial cities fall away from them, and they can neither protect nor excuse themselves any more than with the name of the church, and nevertheless rage and rage against their own conscience. For they know well that the church is subject to God's word, and cannot be anywhere except where Christ is taught and preached. Now they must confess, even against their thanks, that our teaching is Christ's teaching. Why then will they not hear us? 

The boys know that the papacy is not. The boys know that the papacy is not God's church, yet they all cry out in unison; and they know that they cannot exist or protect themselves with this title, yet they want to protect themselves with it. The church is where Christ is taught and preached. We teach Christ, as they themselves say, and yet they do not want to hear us; therefore the papacy is not God's church. Nor will we yield nor allow God to be over the church, and not the church over God.

138 The Papists' Deception. (Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, p. 81.) 


In these days came from England the servant of D. Johannes Thixtollus, Remigius, who said many praiseworthy and glorious things about the country and the government, how they hoped with great desire for the gospel; even some bishops taught sincerely against the abominable abomination of Pabstism. The name of the Wittenbergers, Luther's and Philip's, was highly famous, and those were already held in honor who had only been in Wittenberg and could tell something about it. He said of the very well cultivated land of their region, and told of the frauds of the monks at Candelbrugk, who had made a Crucifix with changeable countenances, [movable] mouth, lips; it could bend, had features and buttons on the back, and many people would have been moved to the highest veneration; but now in the last few weeks the intrigues had been revealed by the visit of the king, and shown publicly by the bishop in London. And at last, he said, this image had been led through the streets everywhere and destroyed. Luther replied: "The image should be kept in memory, as our Elector has an image of the Holy Virgin, who carries the infant Jesus in her arms, which would also be movable by its features, because it would not have wanted to look at the praying people, but turned towards its mother, so that they would seek mediation there, 1) and then it turned with outstretched arms towards the praying people. 


139. from the papist mass, as they are now flowering. (Cordatus No. 531.) 


We have very great refuters of our apology. Faber writes against the article of justification. Eck against the power of the pope and human traditions; Cochlaus against the marriage of priests and for the invocation of the saints. Now they call the mass a mysterious sacrifice. Let them go here.

But if it is a secret, that is, a sealed one, then it is not a true sacrifice, and the people will withdraw their hand. 


140 The papists' murderousness. (Cordatus No. 250.) 


Under Leo the Tenth there were two monks in the Augustinian monastery, 2) who, moved by the infamy of the papacy, had spoken something against the pope in their sermons; and behold, in one night assassins entered, cut off the heads of both of them and stuck their cut-out tongues in their buttocks. Julius treated Egidius, a very learned Roman, more humanly, although he had spoken very sharply against him, as he once did in asermon to the Roman citizens, which he began: "Go to the castle which is against you, for it is called the Castle of the Holy Angel [Engelsburg], the Pope's trust and confidence, the fortress. This one, who was also an Augustinian monk, Julius made Cardinal. Cordatus was present at this sermon. 3) 


141 Another of the Papist Murderers. (Lauterbach, Aug. 6, 1538, p. 110.) 


On August 6, a letter arrived from Bucer, in which it was announced that the Council in Vicenza had ended, and that the Cardinals had left, and that in many large cities the Gospel was being preached publicly with great constancy, in Piacenza, Bologna, and that the Pope was very angry. He had called a German, named Corfontius, to Rome with a safe escort 4). When he arrived there and wanted to go to the pope, he was thrown from the bridge into the Tiber. He answered: "This is the faithfulness of the papists. Blessed is he who does not trust the scoundrels in this way.

But we go from the person and life to his doctrine, which we dispute, and say: If the pope were St. Peter, he would be a godless knave and devil. 


The first is the first of a series of new books. (Cordatus No. 508.) 


When someone asked how St. James had come to Compostella, he replied: 


1) Here is an error in the Latin manuscript: Nam Tolosae et sepulti sunt, which gives no sense. The assumptions, which Mr. D. Wrampelmeyer makes, do not give any satisfaction. Therefore, we have seen ourselves compelled to leave it in this case with the reading of Aurifaber's table speeches, which at least gives a sense. Tolosa may not mean Toulouse, but the city in Spain. Whether there should be apostle graves there, we do not know of course. That Luther would count Toulouse or Tolosa to Germany does not follow, just as little as that he would have counted Rome, which is mentioned immediately after, to Germany.

and had great fortune, as our Lord God casts such outward temporal gifts into the Rapuse. 1) But David, the pious, God-fearing king, though he was fortunate enough, for he had conquered the Philistines, the Moabites, the Edomites, the Syrians 2c.; yet he was miserable at home in his house, a miserable, sorrowful man, all was full of trouble, because of adultery and murder: there the brother slept with the sister, one murdered the other: Absalom stirred up rebellion against his own father, whom he drove out of the kingdom. And even though his reign was not as happy and respectable as that of the other godless kings, as far as the outward appearance was concerned, he still had God's word pure, which he honored and promoted with faithful diligence, thus breaking the heart of our Lord God, which the others did not do, therefore they also had to go to ruin and perish miserably. 


153 The Malice of the Papists. (Cordatus No. 1363. 1364.) 


If | had not been a doctor, the devil would have given me a lot of trouble; for it is not so easy to attack things and to accuse the whole papacy, and nevertheless | would have gladly obeyed the pope and all the bishops, but since they do not want my obedience unless | deny Christ and his gospel, | would rather challenge them than make God a liar. 

In baptism and in the first commandment, we all vow to hold fast to God, and in all the temptations we overcome, this vow of ours is renewed. Otherwise | would have died long ago. 


Whether the pope is about a concilium. 


Doctor Luther said that Gerson was the first one whom our Lord God started to enlighten in this last time of the world, and he has been comforting to many people and consciences. But the pope condemned him, because he started to dispute, 


1) Cf. cap. 2, § 129. 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 152-155. 


929 


whether the pope was about a concilium; and wrote a Dialogum about it, which pleased me exceedingly. He introduces two persons, as the Detrectatorem and Adulatorem, the disputed ones of the pope. He would have liked to have found a medium that one should not give the pope too much, nor too little. 

At Augsburg, Anno 1518, when | appealed to a concilium from the pope, the Cardinal called me a Gersonist; then | answered: | do it by command and order of the Concilii at Costnitz, because the same has first opposed the pope, and the pope has deposed three. Then the Cardinal said: O est reprobatum illud Concilium, it is no longer valid; for the pope wanted to be above the Concilia and above God's word. But because now the bright light of the Gospel shines, there is a great contempt for the divine word. And this is what the Lord Christ says John 3:19: "This is the judgment, that the light came into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light." However, in the same place he also says: "Believe in the light, because you have it, so that you may be children of the light", Joh. 12, 35. But we do not listen and do not let ourselves be told, we also do like the Jews. Luther once said this to Hieronymo Besoldo of Nuremberg. 

D. Martinus also said at another time to M. Veit Dietrich: that Panormitanus Canonista pretended that privati hominis sententia praeferenda sit toti Concilio, si sit rationalis, aut melior, testimoniis Scripturae confirmata; and introduced the example of Paphnutii. But for the sake of his opinion he was excommunicated by the pope. cirt. 


155 M. Veit Ammerbach's pretense that the pope should be the external head of the church. 


There was a professor artium at Wittenberg, named M. Vitus Ammerbachius, who pretended that in the Christian church there should nevertheless be an external head, and that one should recognize and accept the pope for such a head. M. Luther said: "Graecia has never been under the pope, India, nor Scythia, like St. Hierony. 


930 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 155-159. 


931 





mus writes, since yet many more devout Christians have been. How do they come with the lazy argument, quod Ecclesia debet habere externum caput, videlicet Romanum Pontificem? But the whole Historia Ecclesiastica is against it, the whole Occidens has not been sub Papa, Totus Orions also not. It is only a Superbia with Ammerbach. O Lord God, who thus falls, that is a case above all cases. | am sorry for him, he will fall into other errors more. They are poor people, they do not think of the hour that will come to them. 

Luther further said: "Wittenberg nevertheless gives quite a lot of swarms. But how to do it? It is said, as St. John says in his first epistle, Cap. 2, 19: "They went out from us, but were not of us.” The false apostles and brothers had to come from the apostles. Where does the devil come from? From angels. Where do the harlots come from? From virgins. Where do the jacks come from? From pious people. The evil thing must come from the good. Where did Cain come from? From Adam and Eve. 


The papists' lies are public. (Lauterbach, May 21, 1538, p. 84.) 


The papists boast much against us of this example: Arius also ruled for a long time, more than four years, 1) and then he was ruined; the same will happen to the Lutherans. To them | answer: Arius ruled with his sect for about three hundred years, but because it was a heresy, it fell. Our opponents, however, are forced to approve our [doctrine] against their will; both the cause itself and the truth are there, but their lies come to light. 


The pope is a lion and a dragon. 


It is impossible that the pope can rest, if he already tolerates and bites the inflicted damage; however, he intends to avenge such dishonor with clandestine stratagems and tricks, 


1) This time refers to the person of Arius, the other, three hundred years, to his followers, the Arians. 


how and when he can. But it is easier to overcome a lion than a dragon. Thus St. Augustine says of the devil that he was a lion in the time of the martyrs and a dragon in the time of the heretics. Therefore let us watch and pray; for though we have martyred him in body, yet his soul still lives. Let us pray without ceasing and with confidence, for it is of great need, "for we have to contend, not with flesh and blood, but with the evil spirits in the air," Eph. 6:12. 

The king of England despises the pope's body, has rejected his ban and canonization, and has thrown off his yoke; but he still keeps his doctrine, still holds it dear and valuable. But the pope will not give it to him, he will bewitch him and sneak behind him with deceit and secret tricks and practices. For this king's apostasy is a bad example for Pabst's kingdom. After that, the other kings should do the same. 


158 The Malice of the Papists. 


It is unspeakable how great and insolent the wickedness and godlessness of the papists is. For, although they must confess that our doctrine is the right, true word of God, they dispute it and persecute it. If they taught it, it would and should be right; but because we say and teach it, it must be wrong. This is the regnum mundi, the kingdom of the world, and the devil's office, where the consequence is denied, and what goes before is admitted. This is a sin that comes not from error but from hardened malice. For even natural reason must say and conclude: If God has commanded it, then one should keep it justly. Neither would N. N. or any other prince and lord suffer that a magistrate should despise his commandment. 


The papists' tyranny and despotism. 


In 1539, February 21, D. C[aspar] Z[euner] 2) came to D. Martino, whom he comforted. 


2) Aurifaber does have "Cellarius" as a marginal gloss, but because Rebenstock |, 78d. and Bindseil |, 143 agree: “tnno 1539. 21 Januarii Oasxar 2in6rus vocatus in xastoreni ‘riderZensern, we think the latter is more correct. 


932 


and courageously made him his appointment: because it would be God's work, he should be called upon to promote and bless the work he had begun, and to give capable servants and to raise them in pure doctrine. He also promised him that by order of the Elector, the visitators would come there in the most beneficial way and do the execution, so that he would resist the little snappers who wanted to seize the spiritual and church properties. 

The devil gets in the way everywhere, so that he hinders the course of God's word. With us he does it through ingratitude and security and false brethren; thus he makes people hostile to us, thus he ropes them away from us. With foreigners and in foreign nations he does it through tyranny and murder. For in France so many people have been killed and strangled for the sake of the teaching of the Gospel that the king has finally had to forbid it to the theologians in the Sorbonne and the lords of parliament in Paris. Likewise the heretics in Hispania, if they seized one, the emperor was unable to exorcise him. 

In Paris, 1) for the sake of a few words, which were in accordance with God's word, they pulled a pious, honest citizen up to a high place in front of his house, tied him to a gallows with a chain around the middle of his body, put a fire under him, let him roast for a while, and after that, when he was well tortured and martyred, let him fall into the fire, so that he completely burned to powder; his wife, who was pregnant, and his little children had to see such horrible spectacles, and after that all their goods were confiscated and taken away from them, so that he should have said once: It would be too much to give the Mother of God the honor that is due only to her Son, who alone is our only mediator and intercessor. 


169. exhortation to patience in such tyranny. 


It is better, said D. Martinus, that we overcome it with patience, rather than that Germany 


1) Stangwald: Anno 1535. 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 159-162. 


933 


should cause a commotion and make a noise. For Germany is a large body, and if it becomes quite active, it cannot go without great harm. As we saw and experienced in the Peasants' Revolt (1525), for the sake of a cold cause, how in such a short time such a great outrage got out of hand and increased, be silent, if the princes and estates would do together, since we were silent about it. Oh, the papists have not done with it. Even if they were to extinguish us Wittenbergs or Saxons, they would still prepare and arouse a great fire from a small spark. Therefore let us pray for peace and that they may be converted. But they would rather perish and perish with us, they are so hostile to us. 


161. belly servants, who do it the way you want it, hang the coat to the wind. 


It was said of D. Peter G., 2) pastor of D[resder], who was a great persecutor of the gospel, that he had improved; for he claimed that he had had to do much against his will, forced to do so; but now he wanted to follow the gospel and preach the same, so that he would remain in office. Such companions, said D. Martinus, are the papist ventriloquists, hanging their coats after the wind blows, following the time and the weather, seeking only their own, not God's glory, nor man's salvation. Nothing can be built on them. 


The bitter hatred of the papists. 


Doctor Martino was sent a printed booklet from the Imperial Diet, in which a gruesome agenda, and next to it writings, were full of blood. When he had read it, he said with great astonishment: "This is a miracle of God, who has allowed such letters to come to light, in which the bloody plot and atrocious tyranny of the papists is revealed, and that such great lies, invented against the wholesome teachings of Christ, are made known. 


2) Bindseil 1, 144: D. Peter Eisenberg. 


934 


Praise be to God, who watches for His own who sleep, but stops and prevents the enemies' bloody plots, runs and practices. 


163. persecution and rampage of the papists. 


Two cities in France over which Sadoletus had been placed were burned to the ground for the sake of the Gospel, so that even the infants were not spared. That is why Calvinus would have fled to Switzerland, admonishing them that they would not consent to such atrocious tyranny and that they would renounce the alliance before the king. Then said D. Martinus said: "These are terrible and cruel deeds; Calvinus is a learned man, but very suspicious of the error of the Sacrament. Oh dear God, keep us by your word. 


164. beginning of Luther's teaching with indulgences. 


When Johann Tetzel proclaimed his indulgence in the castle of Wittenberg in 1517, Andreas Carlstadt sent out propositions in which he argued that no one could be granted an indulgence if he first confessed in the castle church. Against this D. Luther had opposed it, disputing that it was a privilege and nota mandate; Carlstadt had become quite angry and said to Luther: "If he knew that he was speaking in earnest, | would accuse you of being a heretic before the pope. 


Doctor Luther has been fearless against the pope. (Contained in Cap. 24, z 114.) 


166: That D. M. Luther is silly, and yet leads a fine cause against the devil. 


On the Sunday after Michaelmas, Anno 1541, D. Martinus was very cheerful, and joked with 


Cap. 27: Of the Antichrist, or Pabst. § 162-166. 


935 


his good friends over tables, respected his art and skill very little, and said to one over tables: | am silly, but you are a prankster and much more learned in rebus oeconomicis et politicis than | am. | do not take care of things, but have to deal with the Ecclesia and must look at the devil's entrenchment. | believe that, if | were to give myself to the world, | would also notice it. | believe everyone, therefore | can be cheated; but as soon as | present myself before someone, he takes nothing from me. And he said to those who were sitting at the table: Do not blame me, | am happy and in good spirits, for today | have heard many evil newspapers and now | have also read an evil letter. Now it is right that the devil should befall us in this way. 

We have a good won cause, and God is with us in the game, who will soon lead it out gloriously; for they, the papists, are overdoing it and are desperate boys. The pope wants to be judge over us, since he is part, and we have accused. Bishop Albrecht of Mainz wants to burn his own cities, and has now taken by force a prisoner in one city who was a Protestant. So other people attach themselves to the Turk and give him tribute. God will make up and judge the earth, and you will soon know. Just keep GOD quiet, they all have to go down. Thus, D. Staupitz used to say to me, even if he was sad and distressed: God grant patience, yet nothing remains unpunished, and all history testifies that God comes and finally punishes. It is already from this that one wants to consider Luther a prophet and apostle, because he prophesied that there is nothing good in a papist. This is now found in the murder-burning. Let us wait a little. Although they are now burning themselves white because of it, but it does not help, Abel's blood cries out against them.

Enemies. Since we teach and say these things, and yet suffer here those who praise them with their verses and writings, what is the result but that they say, "Now they praise us, and soon they rebuke and reproach us again? So they mock us all. 

| believe there are many scouts here, but we ask nothing of them. Hear us, do you like it, and behold, we are well satisfied. But we will not suffer that they should throw us into their mouths, and praise and extol our enemies. It is enough that thou art here among us as a knave and a traitor: but thou shalt not praise the bishops with public writings and books, which seek our lives with the sword, and seek to murder our souls with lies. But he that praiseth them, let him have that for a reward, whereof Solomon saith, The wicked perish, and go to destruction. 

| say this so that you may know that we are called to this, to the light, as St. Peter says in 1 Ep 2:9, in which we are to confess Christ. Because we have so many great and powerful enemies, we must indeed be vigilant and watchful, especially against the devil, who pursues us without ceasing and persecutes us inwardly and outwardly. Truly, he does not celebrate. But have patience, be confident and joyful, it is certainly good and useful for you, even if you do not think it so now, when you are challenged, but do not let yourself be challenged, do not judge and judge according to your feelings, but according to God's word. Christ is the goal to look to and strive for; but not all meet and attain it, some fall short and perish, fall to the ground over it. We should be pious, and let such little incense be consumed, and let the sharp wind blow by: if something more happens, we should also trample it under our feet and bite it, and see that we have and keep our bridegroom, Jesus Christ, in our hearts, and, as the bride says in the Song of Solomon, Cap. 8, 6, "like a seal in our arms. Martin did this exhortation publicly in church on the day of the Holy Trinity and read out his printed mandate against Simonis Lemnii's book of shame and blasphemy. 


14. a different one from Lemnio. 


When Lemnii's book of shame D. Martino was brought, in which he did not spare even the poor female sex; then he said, "Well, they act against us with lies and sham; therefore Christ says Matt. 5:11, 12: "Blessed are you when men revile and persecute you for my sake, and speak all kinds of evil against you, if they lie about it. Be glad and of good cheer, for you will be well rewarded in heaven" 2c. Such books do not make me stupid or fainthearted, who write jokes, dolts, Lemnius and the like. 


15. from Faber. 


Since Johannis Fabri, the evil and poisonous slanderer, was remembered, D. Martinus said: "Such poisonous people are the most annoying and harmful, with whom one should neither trade nor dispute: for they do not appear freely in public, and do not go right under one's eyes, but only blasoheme and revile everything, out of poisonous hatred, in the most bitter and atrocious way; just as Emser, Cochlaus, Eck 2c. were. 


16. by Witzel. (Lauterbach, Oct. 11, 1538, p. 147.) 


On October 11, one said of the horribly bitter hatred of Witzel and Cochlaeus, who had written against the articles of Luther's confession 1) and much praised by the fathers. He answered: | do not want to read them. After all, you may praise the fathers much, which | have also read. But we have a Father in heaven, who is above all fathers. Their patches and rags count for nothing. It shall be nothing, since 2) they write from a malicious and blasphemous heart, rather those writings are publicly considered lies. 


17. of the joke's blasphemy. (Lauterbach, Oct. 11, 1538, p. 147 f.) 


When Witzel was remembered, the poisonous man who attacked all of Luther's articles and

with whimsical gibes, he replied, "That is why | do not read them, because they write with such great bitterness and blasphemy against the Word and against their own consciences, and do not build consciences in the least. As Cochlaeus concludes: "The article of the Trinity is not expressed in the Holy Scriptures, but it is nevertheless believed; therefore one must believe human traditions without the Word. The joke is full of errors and blasphemies without end, nor does one let the boy live. He also praises lJ. S(chenk) and J. A(gricola) to our shame, that they taught rightly that whoever was once converted could no longer sin, but that whatever they did was good. But how should one do to him? After all, St. Paul did the same [Rom. 3:8.j: "Let us do evil, that good may come of it." Let us pray against their blasohemies. 


18. godless promotion. 


(The first paragraph contained in Cap. 37, § 70.) (Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 161.) 


One spoke of Witzel's reception in Leipzig. Luther replied: | am glad that he is there. He is caught in a mousetrap, as it were, because he is full of the worst opinions. When he comes out, he may well get his reward. He has sucked the poison from the Campanus, who in a very ungodly way wrote a book under this title: "Against the whole world after the apostles’ time." It is much taken in one bite. But he has lost his previous advantages. Witzel keeps behind the times, that is why his sermons are so cold. He teaches coldly because he does not dare to come out, walks like a tense hare, fears the judgment of the listeners. His prayer is not free, but bound in a prison. The words of a speaker, however, which are to move others, must be completely free. He teaches nothing sincerely, as the very presumptuous all do, like Carlstadt with his that, for 

In short: the spirit teaches, not the language. But the languages help the spirit, without which they are void. The words serve the things, not the things the words. What happened to the emperor Sigismund at the con 





cillum at Constance, who said: We do not want a oxioyau. The orator answered: Not 

oxiouay but oxiova, Against he said: If lam the master of all rights, i.e. of things, |am much more a master of grammar, i.e. of words. But the papists imprisoned him. He had to put on a diaconal skirt and read the Gospel at the Christmas Mass. And so every emperor is a diaconus of the Roman Church. The Roman king is subdiaconus. After that he was soon very unhappy against the Turks and against the Germans. The kingdom of Bohemia disintegrated and was completely devastated, which was once the best; so that they killed Ladislaus, a very good king, and chose as king a furrier, the grandfather of Duke George, a brave soldier. When at last King Matthias died, the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. 


19. a different one from Witzel. 


When Witzel's book, called Tesseratheca, was brought, in which he wanted to reconcile and make up with the pope and Luther, out of pure hopefulness and presumption, Doctor Martinus said: "If Witzel can accomplish this with the pope, then | will yield to them on our part more than they desire. These propositions and proposals are forged and made more out of fear than out of devotion and good will. For those of N. may want to court N. N. with these proposals, as they are otherwise hostile to the gospel. For the gospel is not a doctrine for usurers. 


20. from the Latomo. (Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 170.) 


After that, the Frenchman Latomus’ was mentioned, who would have written against Luther. Luther said: He is excellent among all my opponents. His main reason was: Whatever may have arrived from the church, one should not reject it. This is a plausible argument. As the Jews cried out: GO God's people! so the papists: The church cannot err! This is the highest 


946 Cap. 28: Of the adversaries who wrote against Luther. § 20. 21. 947 


Argument, so that the prophets and apostles have beaten themselves, as Moses says, 5 Mos. 32, (v. 21.): "They have provoked me against that which is not God; against a foolish people will | provoke them to anger." Likewise Paul, Rom. 2, 29.: "But this is a Jew" (belonging to GOD's people), "who is hidden within." Likewise Isaiah (11, 10.): "After the [root of Jesse] shall the Gentiles inquire." That is why the papists argue thus: It is impossible for GOD to leave His Church, because Christ says: | will be with you until the end of days (Matth. 28, 20.); thus. | answer: The "with you" must be distinguished, namely, which is the true church, whether it is the afflicted hearts or the Roman Sodomites. 


The 29th 


21. from a converted papist. 


There was talk about a very good man, a papist, who had accepted the gospel. Then said D. Martinus said: "These are the best, who do not suddenly burst out, but do it thoughtfully, hold against each other scriptures and arguments of both parts, put them on the gold scale, and search in the fear of God for the right truth. From this come fine men, capable of argument, who can hold the sting. Such a man was St. Paul, who in the first place was a strict Pharisee and a work saint, who held the law with seriousness and stiffness; but afterwards he taught and preached Christ in the very best and purest way, against all Judaism. 


chapter. 


Of the downfall of the enemies of the divine word. 


1. from some papists quick and' frightening death. 


2. punishment of presumption. 


3. punishment of a desecrator of God's word. 


1. from some papists quick and frightening death. (Cordatus No. 538. No. 1014. No. 1494.) 


No one considers the miracles of God that are happening now, many of which are happening against the papists. For the bishop of Trier died of drunkenness after Ferdinand's coronation. Count Ernst of Mansfeld cried out fiercely that the emperor was the savior, and died without lux et crux [light and cross], without confession and sacrament. Count von Werdenwerck died a sudden death at Augsburg, crying out that he wanted to die in the war against Luther. Doctor Matthias, who celebrated his first mass at Erfurt, died before this Imperial Day. For the people of Erfurt dragged him and his three whores into the whorehouse, defiled them before his eyes, and he was consumed with grief and died in that same year. 


This would certainly have to be taken seriously into account, that in the recent past years all those died miserably who mockingly spoke of the gospel. Count von Werdenwerck, Count of Mansfeld, the chancellor of Trier, Caesar Pflug. To all of them the gospel was a fable, a vain joke. Duke Georg, however, is not mortal, he is serious and does not joke. 1) 

When a nobleman from the lineage of the Ziegler despaired a few paws before his death, he said at the hour of his death: Devil, there you have the soul. A frightening example, although | have also heard similar things in the past. For when a captain of the Venetians had conquered a certain city and he had to die before the victory, he blasohemed. 


1) The last sentence is probably said ironically. 


948 Cap. 29: Of the downfall of the enemies of the divine word. § 1-3. 949 


He blasphemed the Holy Virgin and St. Peter in the Venetian manner, 1) and another Italian said dying: "To the world | give my goods, to the worms my body, and to the devil my soul. For among the Italians there is very great blasphemy. Erasmus knows these customs very well, and therefore they do not dare to do anything against him, because he would know how to tell them such things. 


2. presumption. (Cordatus No. 1109.) 


When someone wants to be able to do a thing and can't, it's a real pain. There is nothing more miserable than a presumptuous person. The papists are like that when they preach my words against me. That is what that Leipzig preacher did with my postilion, who was struck by a blow on the Sunday after Christmas, when he preached the history of Anna for the works. Place, time, person and words indicate that the man must have been hit. 


3, punishment of a desecrator of God's word. (Except for the last paragraph, Lauterbach, July 7, 1538, p. 96.) 


After that, Mag. Cellarius told a story that had happened in Bautzen in a village where a godless apostate pastor, 2) who had become a poisonous slanderer of the gospel, died struck by a terrible lightning and thunderclap. So also a certain pastor in Friedberg near Frankfurt nine years ago made a 


The pastor was obedient to the mother, the church, and he appointed the next day on which he would hold processions with prayers and litanies against this disease. Early on that very day, the pastor himself died, and so the procession became a funeral. Luther said: "Such examples are worthy of attention, for we see God's power present in them. 


Here also belongs the example that a monk in the year '26 in a public sermon called Paul a parasite and a liar, and one should not believe him because it would be against Christ that he said (Rom. . 12, 15.): "Rejoice with the joyful." And soon after he had chattered these words, he died. 


A doctor at K[6nigsberg], 3) who was a true Papist, at the University of K. once disputed there in the school, and brought forward this argument: A man's testament, if it is confirmed, may not be changed, much less God's: but now the Lord's Supper of Christ under both forms is God's testament; therefore one may not change it, nor should one. After the disputation he went out with a noble rich citizen, to whom he said: "How do you like my disputation? He said, "Very well," and slapped him neatly on the armpit, saying, "The servant who knows the Lord's will and does not do it will be beaten with two hands," Luc. 12:47. The next day the doctor died a quick death. So it goes. God does not joke with him in the play, he wants to keep above his word, or does not want to be God. Such examples should be well remembered and considered, for they are both terrible and comforting: terrible for the godless despisers of God's word; comforting for the God-fearing, who love and value

') Martinus told a story about a disobedient servant of Lucas Maler who had left Leipzig and had his master follow him on foot the next day with Christian Goldschmiede. That he, said the doctor, would not do me such a trick, | also wanted to have prayed to him. That is why Augustine said: "When rulers and lords humble themselves too highly, their reputation is weakened and they are despised. A servant should be a servant, a lord a lord. 


4. about a monk who ran away from the monastery and deceived the pope. 


The whales are very cunning, mischievous people; but since they learn to recognize the Germans, they can be easily deceived by them. Like a Carthusian, a desperate boy, who secretly had a woman with him in his cell, he finally ran away from the monastery and became a mameluk. After that, he regretted it and came to Rome to the pope. But first he went into the kitchen. And when they all fled from him, as from an apostate and a renegade, not thinking otherwise than that the pope would have him slain and put to death, he said, Give me a good soup and drink of wine, and after that | will do well in my cause; and went well fed to the pope, and fell down before him, and said, Misericordia, Misericordia, Misericordia, grace, grace, grace; and the pope thrust him under his feet, and said, What wilt thou? He said: | want to mend my ways, most holy father. Then the pope absolved him, and he went out again into the kitchen, struck him a little stone, and said, Didn't | tell you that | wanted to do my thing well, and that you should not be troubled? 


5. the great quantity of monasteries. 


The Electorate of Saxony had twelve monasteries of the Barefoot and Minorites, five monasteries of the Preachers or Paulites and Carmelites, and four monasteries of the Augustinians; these were only beggars' monasteries, which are now _ being destroyed by themselves. Then the Englishman, who was at the table with D. Martino, said

went: In England, if not many German miles of road were long and wide, there would have been 32 mendicant monasteries. (The following is contained in Cap. 27, § 36, and Cap. 56, § 4.) 


6. the freedom of the monks. 


The monks had great privileges from the pope, even over the bishops, they would not have considered a bishop: they were without means under the pope, and subject to no one else. The bishop of Merseburg had a quarrel with the Benedictine monks, but the pope, when it came before him, did not want to get involved in it, nor to tolerate the matter, wrote to the bishop: The Roman see could not suffer such clamor of the monks; it should humble itself and be satisfied with them. 


7. of gray monks and Francisco. 


Franciscus, a whale from the city of Assis, no doubt a pious man, did not think that such a superstition and superstitious being should come out of his life. There were so many gray monks that they offered to send forty thousand monks against the Turk, and the monasteries should nevertheless remain occupied. 

The Franciscan and Grey Monastic Order first arose under Emperor Frederick the Other, during whose reign St. Elizabeth was canonized and brought into the number of saints. Anno Domini 1207. Franciscus played his game for eighteen years, two years under Emperor Philip, four years under Emperor Otto, and twelve years under Emperor Frederick the Other. After that, when he died, he appeared to the pope in his sleep, holding a cup in his hand, and let it run out of his side full of blood. 

Is it not a regiment that starts with dreams and lies? Therefore, the pope is not God's image, but his monkey. In sum, he wants to be God and emperor. As Pope Innocentius the Third said: Either | want to take the crown from K[aiser] Philippo, or he from me. Oh, such histories should be described with diligence. If | were younger, | would write a chronicle of the popes. 


954 Cap. 30: Of the monks, their life and good days. §8-10. 


8. from where the papist clergy and monks have had their access most. 


The papists have had their greatest enjoyment and access from the offerings, and thirtieths, vigils and masses. A monastery granted each of the nobility, one to help the other, thirty florins annually; a rich farmer, a horseman, who had to harness and horses, four florins. Now one would unwillingly give four sacrificial pennies. 


9. pillars of the papacy. (Lauterbach, Jan. 14, 1538, p. 9.) 


On January 14, he said a lot about the realm of the pope, how it had not existed by laws, but by superstition, but that the preacher monks and the Minorites had been the best helpers of the pope, because those Dominicans [Dominicastros] and the order of the preachers were such glorious pugilists that they sought to glorify their fame by the disgrace of others and could not stand learned people. | mean, they honestly burned themselves on Reuchlin. And they have also set many things in motion against me, but have thereby done themselves evil. In the future Concilium they will take a lot of liberties with the rest of the papists by their shouting. Their highest cry is and was: What is the Bible and the Scriptures? The church and the concilium must be obeyed. With this they will want to shout over us, because they arrogate to themselves the right and the supervision over all people, even the judgment over the godly they will arrogate to themselves. As once happened to the prophets, who were forced to succumb. Jer. cap. 29 (vv. 26 ff.), where he speaks against Zephaniah the priest: "The Lord has made you overseer in his house over all madmen and prophets; so why do you not punish Jeremiah of Anathoth? From this passage it is clear that even priests who are placed in the highest office have abused their prestige against the pious prophets. Therefore he continues in such a way that the godless in the world will mock the godly under the appearance of piety. Blessed is he who is not mocked here. 





955 


19. of mendicant monks. (Lauterbach, Feb. 2, 1538, p. 20, and p. 21.) 


If the pope should take the liberty of rejecting the monks and monastics, he will set a fine fire. Admittedly, in Germany they are almost expelled, but in other nations they are still in bloom, and the pope has strengthened them earlier. He has made them feisty, where he has taken them into his fold, and given them the highest cardinals as protectors. If he now wants to expel them, it will be a fine game. All would conspire against him and the princes against the pope. Princes against the pope. For kings, princes and even the emperor have monks as confessors, by whom they let themselves be persuaded. 


Pope Julius, a very defiant man and an inveterate devil, made up his mind that he wanted to reform the Franciscans so that he could bring the different sects into a uniform rule. The monks, however, instigated kings and princes who resisted the pope in letters. But Julius would not turn to the letters and go forward. At last a Cardinal, moved by a very urgent request dev Franciscans [accompanied by] eighty thousand crowns, said: Who can resist so many armed men? and persuaded the pope. What will one do now in the abolition of so many monastic brothers? If only the common monasteries were overthrown, then the royal and princely convents, the princely monasteries, would soon also perish through the revolt of the people, for if one lets the dog chew on the rag, he soon eats the meat as well. In short, the monks are rightly hated by the priests of the churches, because they draw all enjoyment to themselves and have left only baptism to the priests. They have arrogated to themselves all other advantages without work and have suppressed the offices of the church with their superstitious customs. That is why before our time so many mocking and ridiculous things were said by the monks, and they burned among themselves with irreconcilable hatred, the Dominicans and Franciscans, for the sake of the first inheritance, where one kept the skin, the other the flesh of the calf.

On the other hand, the beggars, the barefooted, under the great pretense of sanctity and humility, were more proud than all emperors, and most often invented lies. 

From this, D. Severus said: "Dear Doctor, once King Ferdinand came to a monastery of the Barefoot monks; now one of the king's secretaries found these letters beautifully and wonderfully inscribed on the wall, As: 


M.N.M.G.M.M.M.M., 


When the secretary looked at the letters and wondered what they meant, King Ferdinand came to the same place, looked at the letters and asked what they meant. The secretary answered: "If Your Majesty would not be displeased by this, | would like to know what the letters mean. The king says: he should tell it, it should be without danger for him; then the secretary says: 

Mentitur Nausea (who was bishop of Vienna), Mentitur Gallus (who was the king's court preacher), Mentiuntur Majores, Minores, that is, the barefoot monks, Minorarii, that is, special monks who live in the Iplbus. The king Ferdinand heard this, and, forgetting it, went away. And was quite politely interpreted and interpreted by the secretary. 


16. of some nuns and convents. (Lauterbach, Sept. 30, 1538, p. 138.) 


On that day, the nuns of Hervord 1) [now Herford] in the Low Countries [Westphalia] wrote to him, entrusted themselves to his intercession, and were very pious virgins, who always lived in harmony from the work of their hands. He pitied them and said: "Such nuns should be left to their liking, just as the field monasteries are princely foundations for noble persons. But the mendicant orders were nets and harpies [birds of prey], which

For from these monasteries suitable persons can be chosen for the church, for the world regiment and for the household. 


17 The Discipline of the Monasteries. (Lauterbach, Nov. 9, 1538, p. 159.) 


On November 9, he spoke about the monastic discipline against the youth, that they made the young people conscience, if they steal one penny, they would have to go to hell. But, alas, so nonsensical is the world, if one steels a hundred thousand, they take no conscience about it. The monasteries have a fine arrival. But the superstition and the trust in the works have caused all the misfortune, it is the devil's way. 


18. from gray monks. (Lauterbach, Nov. 23, 1538, p. 178.) 

Then they spoke of the Franciscan Rule, which at the beginning boasted of this title: "According to the Gospel of Christ," since it teaches nothing of faith, hope, love, and true good works, but only of cold, fictitious, outward works, of poverty, of a fictitious chastity, all of which we have in truth already sworn in baptism. 


19. a different from monks. 


A provincial monk, by order of the emperor, commanded the council at N. that the monks there should be allowed to keep their papist customs and ceremonies. The council gave him this answer: that he should grab himself and not be found. But the monastery was closed to the other monks, so that no one could come in and bring anything to them. That is how the papists want it. 


20 Of the origin of monasticism. 


At Heidelberg in the Quodlibet it was discussed and asked: Where do the monks come from? To this was answered: The devil would be the 


31 


962 - Cap. 30: Of the monks, their life and good days. § 20-24. 963 


Monks founder and creator: because since God had made the priests, the devil wanted to imitate him, had made the plate too large, there would have been a monk dardaus. It is quite a fine poem. For a monk is neither suitable for church nor secular or domestic rule. That is why the devil must make monks who obscure God's word: they were not fit for the church, they blasphemed the secular authorities, they kept and taught coldly of the marriage state; for because it exists and remains in honor and dignity, monasticism is nothing. That is why the devil, under a beautiful mantle, has darkened the most beautiful order of God, namely marriage. If marriage had been taught in the church in a right, Christian and pure way, there would have been fewer monks and nuns. 


21. from widows. 


Saint Paul condemns the widows who break the first faith, 1 Tim. 5, 12, which saying the fathers, also Augustine, have drawn and interpreted on the vows of the monks, since the text clearly says about widows who receive and are fed by common alms. Oh, dear Lord God, how easily do those fall who, enchanted with superstition and superstition, follow the great heap, just as when one rolls wood and straw into the water, it carries away earth and muck. It is the same in the church. 


22. from St. Bernard. 


Saint Bernard was the most pious monk, | love him above all other monks; but he was allowed to say: It would be a sure sign of condemnation if one did not 


Summa: The world wants to have superstition and idolatry, the gray skirt and, as Paul says, such people who do not spare their bodies. | think that Adam's and Eve's furs must have been monks’ caps. Oh, if only the monastic life had not been forced, but free, it would still be to suffer. For what good has the impossible celibate state brought? Rivers in the sleep, which also the married couples are not even left, as Moses writes; since the marriage was commanded to the Jews and free to the Gentiles. Thus, in many regiments, it is customary that no single man who is not a husband is elected to the council, nor is he used in the regiment. Would to God that it also remained free and honest. 


23. from monasticism. 


The monks, but especially the Minorites and Franciscans, have had the best days, and lived in the greatest pleasures, through hypocrisy: they did not touch money, and yet were the richest with great tranquility. The shameful monasticism began when the people, under the pretense of godliness, fled from the worldly trades, which are hostile and cause much grief. But these are the most Christian ranks that God has established and ordered, of which there are three hierarchies, as the domestic, the secular and the ecclesiastical. 


From where the monks have become so proud. 


The mendicant kings with the caps are so puffed up and proud that they have also worshipped emperors and kings. As one writes of the emperor

4. how far one may tolerate the bishops. 


1. from the Cardinal of Salzburg. 


Magister Philippe praised against Doctor Martin Luthern the high intellect and quick head of the Cardinal and Bishop of Salzburg, Matthieu Langen, and said: He had been with him in Augsburg for six hours in 1530, had talked with him about religion; then he had finally said to him: My Domine Philippe, we clergy have never been good. Item, he would also have said: We know well that your teaching is right; 1) but do you not know, on the other hand, that no one has ever been able to gain anything from the priests? you will not be the first either. This Cardinal had been the son of an outreuter from Augsburg, and his father had been of a good, old, noble family there, but. Poverty half became a servant. He was the first Cardinal in Germany, and was known through the promotion of his sisters to the Emperor Maximiliani Court, and then sent to the Pope in Rome in a legation, which then happened; he was made Coadjutor of the Bishopric of Salzburg. 


2. from another bishop in the German country. 


M. Luthern was told that the same bishop had dismissed a schoolmaster and cantor who had been called from Wittenberg in his towns to serve as a schoolmaster: now he had given them ten guilders and let them jump. There spoke D. M. Luther: "The bishops do as their kind does: they are bloodhounds, and their feet hasten to shed blood. He has a mind like Cain, he

will not rest until he has slain Abel. If they start a war, they will lose. We have told and preached it to them enough; now we must prepare and arm ourselves with prayer against them. 

(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 1337.) 

Oh dear God, how you are so patient and let yourself be trampled underfoot, but he has suffered such things from his creature from the beginning. But you can pay them in your time. 

This bishop once saw that in his town one of the people had run in a crowd to the preaching of the Gospel, and with weeping eyes he said: "Oh, we shepherds should do that, how our sheep go astray! Well, | cannot do it differently. When this was reported to M. M.L., he said: "Will Christ be satisfied with this? He will see. He prefers the cardinal's and bishop's hats to divine truth. He fears that he might lose it and be deposed from the bishopric, he does not believe that God can depose the mighty and exalt the lowly, as they sing every day in the Magnificat. But they do not believe, they are the most pusillanimous people: length cannot stand with them, they have too evil a conscience, they are not at one with themselves, they are mad in their ways: for in the Augsburg Act of Anno 1530 they did not think with a single word of the noblest article of the primacy of the Pope and Vicariate of St. Peter, which was the main article of the whole papacy. 

D. M. Luther once said about tables: It would be a German proverb: At a fox one does not break a game; that is, one would like to

Th law is a beautiful bride when she stays in her bed; bu when she crosses over to another bed and wants t rule the theologians in the church, she is a grea whore. That is why the law should take off its bere before theology. 

Of this and other bishops, M. Luther said at anothe time: "| have not read such a frightening and thoroug example of hardening as in them. They far surpass th Jews, Pharaohs, and others; indeed, they are th closest to the devil: my heart in my body often tremble and shakes when | think of them.

from a false heart. (This paragraph in Lauterbach, July 1, 1538, p. 95.) 


In these days Luther was very distressed about the great malice of the bishop [of Mainz] and said with a sigh: Dear Lord JEsu Christe, save my life, and strengthen me, that | may cut a plate for the priests. For it is not a bad one, but the most mocking one. All other princes are, with respect to him and judging by him, simple peasants. This is a right one who dares to boast that not many attacks have been returned to him, as if he himself were in league with Satan. In the Hans Schantzen case, he so won over the lawyers that no one wanted to take up the case against him. These fearful people are afraid to exercise their profession and do not want to imitate the example of Papinianus. Therefore, it must be told to the Junker all the same, because he can very well overhear. When | wrote him a very sharp letter, he was able to overhear everything with a good pretense, except for this argument, which | reproached him with, that he had deprived the poor puke Elsa of her penny and stopped at 80,000 florins, and granted the 300 florins annual interest by grace, not by right. That has hit him badly that this is published. But that whore died very godly by reproach of the Gospel, according to Christ's saying: "The tax collectors and whores may rather enter the kingdom of heaven than you" (Matth. 21, 31.). 

(This paragraph in Lauterbach, 18 Dec. 1538, p. 193.) 


The Bishop of Mainz is a very fearful man, but cruel and tyrannical he is vicious. Brave heroes do everything openly. David, Julius Caesar and others have not had anyone stabbed, but have gone honestly under eyes. But the tyrants are mostly very feminine.

wicked, evil man and a hypocrite: he deceives and cheats everyone: he scents all money like a thief: he will frighten and sadden many people when he dies, to whom he is guilty. 

A princess said to D. M. Luther: "Is there also hope for this bishop, that he might be converted?

About this bishop Luther said on another occasion: 

"| want to leave the testimony behind me that he is the greatest rogue who ever came on earth, except

After that he said, "The Lutherans are such bad boys, they do everything for the sake of money. But because | have stayed with God's word, he could not win me over. For besides, he vexes everyone else. 


3. from other bishops. 


In the year two and forty, M. Luther said: "The bishop of Wuerzburg lets himself be seen as if he were almost with us, because he suffers that the choir students take nuns in marriage. 2c. He also advised a canon who secretly had a married wife that the secret marriage was also to be approved, even if they had not been held publicly nor gone to church and street with each other, if only pious God-fearing witnesses had been present. 

The bishop of Cameris confuted and refuted the Pope's primacy, saying: the holy, Christian, universal Church does not stand on a single person or the Roman Church. So he proved it: for the Church could remain on a single person, as in the time of Christ on Mary and the thief on the cross. The apostles would have fallen, therefore their successors, and those who take their place, could also fall; therefore the church does not stand on a certain place, and proper succession. If anyone said this to our tyrants, he would have to die,” said D. M. Luther. 

The bishops of Rome are the poorest of all, are only lords by name and title, and must walk; but if they have a horse, they must obtain it from another office. For the pope has innumerable table companions, who must buy the privilege with many thousand ducats, so that they may then have exspectations on bishoprics and cathedrals in German and other countries, so that a table companion must buy an exspectancy for three thousand ducats. Thus the pope's kingdom is only a devastation and tearing apart of the domestic, secular and church government or religion, and much more harmful than any tyranny, which alone leads and breaks in by force, but the pope tears apart all divine ordinances with a loud voice. 


Cap. 31: Of cardinals and bishops. § 2. 3. 


977 


Deceit and lies. The bishops in Italy, France, England, Hispania are usually the court advisors of the kings, for the reason that they are poor. But in Germany, because the bishops are rich and powerful and have a great prestige besides, they rule alone. 

M. Antonius Lauterbach showed M. M. Luther a letter from the Bishop of Meissen to the preacher in N., in which he accused him and complained that he was only making the people more wanton with his sermons, did not frighten them, they went there in safety, and were not afraid, only sweeping works of the flesh, not of the spirit. Then said D. M. Luther said: "That misfortune should befall the boys! What can they blame us for, as if we preached works of the flesh, since we always teach against them most vehemently and constantly? Only that they cannot see this because of great hatred and envy: they have innumerable plots and practices against us; they make great efforts, like Martha, and cause them much trouble without need, in vain; but we have mentioned the best part, and always insist on one opinion, namely, that God is Wonderful and Counsel, and that Christ lives and reigns. But they, because they have wicked causes, make endless plans and counsels, and never get on the right path. 

The papal bishops do nothing that their office requires," said D. M. Luther. This is our consolation, that they are not the righteous church, which needs them for the sake of the ministry of preaching, baptism and sacrament. Therefore they are not true bishops, because they are not such bishops as St. Paul defines and describes a bishop, Titus 1:9, namely, "he that holdeth fast the word which is sure, and is able to teach, that he may be mighty to exhort by sound doctrine, and to punish them that speak evil. For the church is in need of the teaching, first, of the law, of what we owe and ought to do. Secondly, of justification and sanctification, how we are justified and sanctified before God, namely, as much as the Holy Spirit works in us, 


1) Probably not to Joh. Cellarius at Bautzen (Bindseil Ill, 296), but to Caspar Zeuner, as also Seidemann (at De Wette VI, 704) assumes. Cf. Cap. 27, § 159. 


978 Cap. 31: Of cardinals and bishops. § 3. 979 


for he alone must always be the master. Third, prayer and thanksgiving, so that we may grow and increase daily in right faith, confession and good works. The antinomians and lawbreakers despise all this and have only a pretense of it. That is why Satan, as God's monkey, has invented much outward sanctification: because he sees that God does such things, he imitates them; but for the sake of an evil end, namely, either to make people mislead and dismayed, or to prefer and exalt lies and what is false to truth and what is righteous, and to accept and hold above them what is true, or to despise what is true for what is false. 

D. M. Luther remembered the Bishop of Brandenburg, with whom he had stood in prayer at Dessau on an Easter day, who had gone to the Gospel of his own accord, and had _ spoken vehemently against the papacy, the Mass, the Canon, and the offering ex opere operato, doing works of his own self-chosen devotion, since the priest, when he picks up the host, says: God, | offer you haec Dona, haec Munera, et haec Sacrosancta, these gifts, presents, and holiest things: since he eats a piece of bread. For he says such words before the consecration, before he consecrates. Ah, God give us such bishops more, as he has given us several universities, as Wittenberg, Leipzig, Rostock, Copenhagen, Kénigsberg, Erfurt. 1) We hope, Mainz shall also come. There is no hope from Cologne. 

After that he wished happiness and God's blessing to M. Cellario and M. Antonio Lauterbach to their bishoprics, and called them bishops; they would be right bishops and would have a greater regiment and superattendence than St. Augustine. For Hippo would not have been so great as Dresden. For if St. Augustine had been burdened with other things, as now the bishops of Shrovetide, he would not have been able to write such great books nor to preach. Unfortunately, we learn that the bishops are now so negligent and unfaithful that they do not only leave their office and do not go out of the church. 


1) Stangwald also mentions TUbingen and Greifswald. 


but secretly follow up and would like to prevent, even kill, those who do so. 

The bishop of N. N., although he has taken a wife, is a godless pope, does not promote the gospel, seeks only his own benefit. Summa, the bishops find only poison and pestilence of the churches and police, disturbers of both regiments. 

In 1539, on January 25, M. Luther had previously admonished D. Caspar Zeuner 2) that he would gladly accept the office of superintendent and the office of preacher at Freiberg, in honor of God. For although we are too weak and far too few for such a high office, God wants us to be fellow heirs and helpers, and He wants to work through us, he said. And he granted that he would write to the Bishop of Meissen, if he wanted to help in such holy work. We must nevertheless, said D. We do not want them to lose their authority and power if they only accept God's word, or at least let it have its free course. 

| will work diligently to help that the monasteries and small dioceses may remain, that preachers and pastors may be chosen and taken into the cities from them and educated, and that the small schools may become common pastors, while the large dioceses will become secular. If one now wanted to let everything fall, where would one take preachers and ministers? For the common rabble and the common man will not and will not feed us, so we cannot do it ourselves and feed ourselves; therefore let us keep this means. As | now intend and intend to ask the princes, in my book of the church. 

If we had one or two bishops on our side and brought them to us, as the bishop of Eichstadt was, who freely said to the emperor: "One should not hinder the course of the Gospel. We also have this hope for the bishop of Meissen, who advised at Leipzig on the day that priestly marriages should be allowed to continue, and that the sacra-

980 


ment under both figures. If that were to happen, we would have enough right away. For the celibacy and the celibate life of the priests is not over five hundred years that [it] has begun. At the time of Bishop Ulrich it was only introduced and started. And they probably circumvented it for a hundred years before they brought it into pregnancy. And they had soon slain the bishop of Mainz in Erfurt, because he had wanted to carry out the execution. 


4, how far one may tolerate the bishops. 


In 1543, on the 15th of May, on the day of our Lord's Ascension, 1) Luther had lunch with the Elector of Saxony. There it was also discussed that the bishops be allowed to remain in their authority, only that they swear to the pope and be godly persons who promote the gospel and are subject and obedient to him, as Speratus is. Then let us give and appropriate to them the righteousness and power to ordain ecclesiastics. Although Philip M. recanted: for there would be danger if they were to examine. Then said D. M. Luther said: "Our people must take the exam and then ordain them with the laying on of hands, as | am now a bishop. 


5. the word bishop, where it comes from and what it means. (The first paragraph Lauterbach, April 10, 1538, p. 59.) 


On April 10 there was much and careful disputirt about the name bishop, what a great office it would be, to whom an army not of goats or pigs, not a heap of gold or silver, but the army of Christ would be commanded. And he said he could not render this name ‘EtrCotrocg clearly enough in German, and the word émioxomeiv, whereon to think, to heed, to care. Therefore the pastors would best be called curators [caretakers]. And some derive it not unskillfully: bishop by sheep, who is to be with the sheep, always and diligently looking after them

remember. A househusband 2) is a name of status. But it should actually be a name of activity. But, unfortunately, the glorious name has completely passed away with the papists and has been only a name of dignity, but the devil's image of a tyrant, as the word spiritual has also become nothing else. Spiritual goods were called interest. Fie on you! At the time of Jerome there were only bishops, i.e. elders and deacons, as his epistle to Evagrius indicates; | will publish it. At that time there was neither cardinal, nor primate, nor patriarch, nor metropolitan, nor archbishop, but a bishop, i.e. an elder, and a priest and a deacon. But now such a fuss has been made, so that the Church, the Bride of Christ, is completely changed and has become a Papist whore, which has only the outward appearance, without the inward Word of God. 


(The following paragraph in Lauterbach, Apr. 30, 1538, p. 75.) 


After that he asked Jonas, who was leaving for Zerbst, to explain the passage 1 Peter 5 to him: The elders are to pay attention voluntarily, not forced, but gladly from the heart, not as if they had to do it. Who does this? Then that he does not seek shameful gain, that he only seeks to benefit souls and consciences. By this tremendous thunderclap he puts down the whole papacy, which seeks shameful gain, seeks honor and avarice, but also all hopefuls and belly servants. These words of Peter are not merely dwayxtixa [teaching], but also prophetic. Peter saw in his mind the ungodliness of his followers, who would do everything by force and for the sake of gain. In short, whichever elder has this testimony in his conscience, according to this passage of Peter, may well be glad and look forward with joy to the archpastor Christ, and certainly boast and say: Here | stand and preach, called with extended divine vocation. On the other hand, the listeners should believe: Here | sit and hear God speak, not

a human being. So the church would stand righteously. In short: St. Peter exhorts diligently. He was also serious, as the first letter concludes, "GOD who called you, the same will complete you, strengthen you, fortify you, establish you. Amen." 

Once upon a time there was a bishop on the Rhine who put many poor people who came to him asking for alms into a house and locked it; then he set fire to it, and when the poor people cried out in a pitiful, loud voice, he said, "Dear, listen to the mice chirping and screaming. This same bishop and tyrant was then eaten by large mice. Since he could not fight off the mice, he had a stone house built for him in the middle of the Rhine, where he lived, as happened. But the mice followed him, swam through the Rhine, and ate him. 


6. the bishops’ negligence. 


No bishop or papist priest in a hundred years has taken with seriousness to care for the poor as the schools and

churches with baptism and the preaching ministry, because they are burdened with God's hatred. 


7. from the bishop of Brandenburg. 


D. M. Luther said that when he had just begun to write against indulgences in 1517, he had sent a letter to the bishop of Brandenburg, asking him to defend Tetzel. He replied: "| should not start with these things; but if | did, | would gain trouble, because | would be attacking the cause of the church. Then the devil incarnate spoke out of this bishop. 


8. ordination of bishops in the papacy. 


If a bishop is made in the papacy, the devil soon leads into him; for he must vow to the pope at Rome to strive, rage and rage against the Lutheran doctrine, and to serve and be obedient to the pope. He swears to serve the devil, and the devil leads into him from the beginning.

The pope with his canons is vain beggary from the laws of the emperor.

they govern the world, for they contain judicial and secular matters; of the church they contain nothing. 


2. from the decree. 


The decree is not confirmed and approved by the pope, and nevertheless the pope follows it in what is for him. And is therefore by 


984 


long custom torn down and taken. For Gratianus, who forged it, when he saw the pope's power and splendid status, he decided and put it all in the pope's favor and will; but this is against the concilia. Therefore one should be obedient to the pope! 

Thomas Aquinas does the same. The same one, although he has the most beautiful sayings in the Scriptures, concludes with the opinion of Aristotle. Gratianus, in Canone of Consecration and Consecration, makes it very Bachantian. There were also Fratres ignorantiae, unlearned brothers. wanted you to read the decree, so that they would see the great impiety, impiousness and wickedness of the pope and his church. In the first, and sometimes, there are fine, good, healthy, righteous canons in it; but after that follows a very ungodly thing. There are two cuncta in it; there the pope has well let himself be noticed, and proved himself to be an anti-Christian. So it goes, when Christ is not there, and hides himself. | read Dinum about the decree, which confirmed me and gave me cause to write against the pope. 


(Here § lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 22, z 132.) 

The pope wanted his decretal to be held equal to the writings of the evangelists and apostles, and to be a purpose to which all canons and distinctions were directed. Summa, the pope wants to be a lord over goods and churches, and a lord over all lords. Fie on you! 


3. the Pabst's decree Jmpietat and his tyranny. 


To M. Holstein, the new jurist, D. M. said: Pabst's decrees have a lot of ugly devilish canons in them. When you read them, remember them. The church is especially plagued and besmirched with them. For the pope may impudently say: If a man kept and believed all four evangelists, and did not keep his decree, he would be maledicted, and it would be in vain and for nothing that he believed in Christ. Item, in another canon it is written: "If the pope sends countless souls to the infernal hell, then he will be destroyed. 


Cap. 32. of the papal or ecclesiastical right, B 2-4. 


985 


But one should not ask: why do you do this? Is this not the devil, and the extreme ruin and poison of the churches? | should follow the pope, even if he leads me to hell; since his office is to comfort the poor consciences and to feed them to Christ. Fie on you, should you teach the consciences to doubt? 

Item: You will often find in decrees that an article from Scripture is proved with fine, beautiful sayings. Now when he (the master) has led all Scripture, he argues against it, and says: The Roman church has decided otherwise; and may impudently subjugate the holy Scripture to men. So also does Thomas Aquinas, who in his writings and books argues pro and contra, and when he has led a saying from Scripture, he finally concludes thus: Aristotle in the sixth book Ethicorum holds it differently. There the holy scripture must give way to the pagan master Aristotle. 

The world does not want to recognize such darkness and abominations, but despises the truth and falls into horrible errors. Therefore, let us make good use of the time, for things will not always remain as they are now. 


4. decretals and decrees. 


In decrees, the pope rules and triumphs like a victor and conqueror: there he is in possession and on his mast, roaring 1) and thundering, along with these words: "We recognize, judge and judge by divine command: We have power to command and to conclude; the others shall and must be obedient to us." Item: "Let all the world know that no one has power to judge the pope, but he alone has power to judge the whole world." 

In the decree he only argues alone, but in the decree he triumphs. | believe that it is written more than a thousand times in the spiritual law that the pope may not be judged by anyone. And there is a special proof of this: for one pope introduces another. Thus proves a thing with himself. Gratia-

nus, who has compiled the decree, begins in the first fine, as said above, at the saying of St. Paul about the office of a bishop, and divides it finely into main sayings; but in the end he decides nothing but about prebends, consecrations, tithes, oils, smearings, and such gimmicks and abominations. All jurists were silent about this, except for Peter of Ferrara. 


5. the spiritual right, what it is. (Lauterbach, Nov. 4, 1538, p. 158.) 


Canon law, according to the judgment of all jurists, is a very unflattering book that reeks of money. Take away the arrogance and avarice from it, and nothing essential remains, and yet it has a shine under the best of appearances; for all misfortune must be raised in the name of God, as only in the name of God is righteousness and salvation. Thus also under the pretense of this name all idolatry and superstition arises; therefore not without reason after the first commandment follows the second: "Thou shalt not uselessly use the name of the LORD thy God." 


6. figure and conterfei of Pabst's Decretals. 


In the decretals of the pope, the consciences and bodies are tormented and martyred, therefore they are rightly compared to this image, which is a virgin at the head, because the beginning is pretty and lovely to look at; the body is a lion that breaks through by force; the tail is a snake, that is, all lies and deceit. So goes the whole pabstacy with its superstitions, superstitions and abominations. 


7 What Gratianus sought in the decree. 


Gratianus, the jurist who compiled the decree, was most concerned about it; and the ultimate reason why he did it was that he might concord and harmonize and unify the canons, and find a means between the good and the evil. He meant well, the good man, but it turned out badly, because he rejected what is good and what is evil. 


approved. For since he has submitted that this is impossible, he is deterred by the gloss that says: This is not to be held, for it is against the pope. For the histories testify that the pope has always wanted to be a lord and master even over the Holy Scriptures and the Word of God. And even though many bishops have resisted him, they have not been able to achieve or maintain anything against him, out of God's great anger to punish the world's ingratitude and contempt for his word. Thus, out of good zeal, Gratianus undertook to concord the sayings of the Conciliar, and to purgate and purify the good Christian canons from the ungodly and evil ones. 


8. of the pope's decree and chancellery. 


Anno 1539, the 21st of April, D. M. read in the decree, and said: It surprises me that in such a large book nothing of the faith is dealt with. So also the fathers, ecclesiastici Scriptores, cold have written thing enough of the doctrine of faith. And when he read in the decree how Emperor Louis, the great Caroli's nephew, had given the pope authority over all kingdoms and lands, he said: "| consider that the pope's chancellery is a cloaca full of lies, as he has drawn all privileges on custom. 


9. against the canonists. 


On the way to Schmideberg, M. was highly moved and very angry with the canonists, and said: He wanted to use Amsdorf as a mediator between him and D. Hieronymus] 1) S[churf]. Since he could not achieve anything by this, he wanted to teach publicly against him. For the canonists' faculty would be the most insolent and ugly, foreign of all arts, and not founded in Roman emperor's rights, but would only be a little trade and enjoyment of the Rabuls and tongue threshers. And they should govern the gospel and God's word? 


10. spiritual law. 


Emperor's law is nothing else than what human reason teaches; but the spiritual law is nothing else. 


988 


What the pope sets, paints and dreams is right. | wanted to give my left hand so that the papists would have to keep their canons. | mean, they would scream more than about Luther. 


11) There is nothing about Christ in Pabst's books. 

In all of the pope's legal books and laws, there is not a single word that teaches what and who Christ is. This is not called the shepherd of the church, but the devil. And comfort me also, as often as | think of it. He speaks of baptism shamefully enough; he has even torn apart the sacrament of the altar. 


(Here 29 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 27, § 43.) 


(Cordatus No. 69.) 

The papacy is the proper kingdom for all godless and despisers of God, who are worthy of such a ruler that they must obey a godless man even against their will, who voluntarily did not want to obey God.

14, the monks, papists, and enthusiasts regiment and comparison. (Lauterbach, Dec. 18, 1538, p. 193.) On December 18, he said of the Church of the Papists, in which the monks plagued the consciences with their statutes. They were worse than the papist epicureans, the cardinals, who ruled physically, thus became vain jurists, but to the highest ruin.

of conscience. Ah, dear Lord! The name of the church was the pretext for the most shameful heresies. For the papists arrogated this name to themselves, since they are the real enemies of the church, partly epicureans, partly idolatrous hypocrites. Therefore, their opinion is to be regarded as nothing without the Word. On the other hand, the courage of the zealots is also not to be suffered, because they completely reject the reputation of the church and hate the sayings of the best and most proven people and only decorate their opinions with passages of Scripture. Both of them sin. Therefore, the name of the church must be carefully taken care of. 


15 For such a long time, no one paid attention to the Pope's ungodly decrees. 


Let it be known that the righteous church has never had a name or title in the world, but has always been without a name; therefore it is believed and not seen. As we confess in infantile faith, and say, | believe a holy Christian church, because it is commonly weighted and covered with the holy cross. Just look at how it went with the pope, aren't these ungodly cruel decrees, the chapter Cuncta 9. q. 3; C. si Papa, dist. 40, item, the Cap: ad. Apostolicae, de appellat. in. 6?

7. where the word Easter comes from. 


1. where the statutes in the papacy come from find. (Lauterbach, Aug. 31, 1538, p. 126.) 

The human statutes in the papacy were created by the most unbearable tyrannical pride according to the words of Christ (Matth. 23, 4.): "They will not lift a finger." For the pope insisted with all his prestige on that which he himself despised, as those two Frenchmen who came from Rome said: they had eaten meat dishes publicly in Rome even on Char Friday. If they did that in France, they would be burned with fire. This is how great the impiety of the Roman See is. 


2. finite cause of human statutes in the papacy. (Lauterbach, Oct. 14, 1538, p. 151.) 

The final purpose of the ordinances of men, namely, that they are the services of God, necessary to salvation, is the devil and all misfortune, even though they have the most godly works. If a preacher, a ruler, a householder fulfills his profession quite diligently, but adds this as a final purpose: | do it for this reason, so that | may do good enough, then all is ruined. Such was the exceedingly godless superstition of superfluous good works, as the ship well indicates, in which only monks and priests and nuns sat, who held out their hands and threw ropes to the other people who were in the sea, as if the holy church were nothing but the heap of the shorn. For even today Witzel blasohemes me for praising and exalting civil works.

3. ceremonies find tinder of superstition. 1) (Lauterbach, April 3, 1538, p. 53.) 


If we could preserve the Catechismum and establish the schools for the churches coming after us, we would have lived well. 2) The ceremonies may fall, for they are tinder and cause of superstition. Let the ceremonies fall, for they are a tinder and cause of superstition. If | could only bring it about that one, as a worldly thing, ordained that one should not eat meat for two days a week, that would be enough. We do not want the superstitious papist fast, since the collations [snack] were better than the meals. And he told a story that had happened in Italy, where a stranger was asked whether he wanted to go to the table for the meal or for the snack. When he chose the meal, he was served herring and a few bad things; but at the other table the best delicacies, fish and confectionery, were served, since they were fasting, with the best drinks. It is a play of the devil. 


4. from the papist fast. (Lauterbach, Oct. 14, 1538, p. 151.) 

After that he said about the strict fasting of the papists, from which very miserable murder and corruption of the youth took place, where the people, according to arithmetic proportion, were forced to observe the same time, the same food, and so the natural forces are ver-

derbt. Therefore, Gerson was forced to write a consolation for those who were challenged, so that they would not despair, because in fasting they sinned less through abundance than through lack, because lack ruins nature. Such darkness was in Pabstism, where neither the Ten Commandments, nor the Christian faith, nor the Lord's Prayer was taught, nor was it considered necessary to know it. 

On that day Luther was quite ill and spoke of breaking down his tent, because he could no longer, he had done his part. God would raise others after him. It would be over with him. He still wanted to do what he could, but under the forgiveness of sins. 


5. hypocrisy and fictitious holiness deceive people. 


People are miserably deceived by the self- invented and chosen holiness of the hypocrites and superstitious. But it is only the Holy Scripture and the Holy Spirit's office to reveal such things. No dialectics can teach the difference between essential and accidental holiness. St. Francis was essentially holy only by the word of faith, and then he was accidentally sanctified by the holiness that was supposed to be in the cap, which the people could see and grasp, and thus assumed as if it were precious holiness; since the cap was a foreign and not an accidental thing of holiness, since it did nothing to it. It is not a natural and accidental thing that belongs to the being, as the form and powers in a young man are a natural and proper thing, although the being can well be without them for itself: but the monk's cap and the rope of St. Francis is a strange, monstrous and accidental thing; as if one put on a fool's cap or a carnival larva, without which a man can well be. 


6. from St. Bernard's Foundation. 


St. Bernard was an abbot for thirty-six years, during which time he built one hundred and sixty monasteries and provided them with abundant income. Think what 


to it has belonged, said D. Martinus, to preserve one hundred and sixty monasteries. Thus superstition and superstition increase and rise to the highest in a short time, since the gospel must beg and go for bread. 


7. where the word Easter comes from. 


About the word Easter, from where it is called, there have been many questions and opinions. Some have said in the first: It comes from the fact that one asked those who used the holy: edistis Easter? Do you eat it? Others say that it is because Christ, having risen from the dead, was seen towards the east. |, said D. Martinus, said, it is a corruptum vocabulum, a word in which the letters are displaced and reversed; as Easter for Urstand. Thus, in ancient times, they called the feast of Epiphany (which is called the feast of the three kings) Ueberschein. 


8. from the feast of the Holy Trinity. 


Doctor Martinus said that the Gospel Luc. 9, about the transfiguration of the Lord Christ, rhymed very well with the feast of the Holy Trinity. 

The chant: Come, Holy Spirit 2c., was made by the Holy Spirit Himself, both words and melody. Also for Easter: Stetit Angelus, der Engel stund bei dem Grabe 2c., is a very good song. 

But the musicians and singers are unequal. Like a German, when he went to St. Jacob, and on the way, when he came to France, the people there asked him to sing German, because he had a good voice; so he sang: The shepherd in the Niedermthl would like to have my little daughter; and he bowed. Then the French also bent their knees, as if he called God. 


9, avoid new and superstitious ceremonies. 


Since M. Antonius D. Martino of the Consistorii order at Merseburg told that it was met with new and superstitious ceremonies.

But the apostles were moved to do this by the resurrection of the Lord Christ and the fact that the Holy Spirit was the one who had come to life. 


The worship in the New Testament and the Christian Church is based on truth and simplicity: there is no colored and painted superstition, nor idolatry. Therefore, St. John describes in his canons and epistles that three things.

1. the Spirit, which is the ministry of preaching; 2. the water, which is baptism; 3. the blood, which is the Lord's Supper, 1 John 5:8. 

But the pope and the sectarians despise these testimonies and have invented and arranged innumerable services, ceremonies and sacrifices by their own choice without God's word; thus the church has been forced out of her bridegroom's institution and order by error.

As a householder says to his servants, "Eat, drink, and let me take care of you, but do my will," so God does not care what you eat or drink or how you dress, but only requires that you do his will. 


2. whether meat may be eaten on Fridays and other forbidden times. 


To this Doctor Martin Luther answered and said, "Yes, which is thus proved, for Christ saith Matt. 15:11, What cometh into the mouth defileth not a man. Item: "To the pure all things are pure," Titus 1:15. Against this one said, "The rulers of the church and the bishops have forbidden to eat meat on Friday, 2c.

5. from the feast of St. John the Baptist. 


The feast of St. John the Baptist, on which the New Testament began, should be left, for it says: "The law and the prophets have prophesied until John," Matth. 11, 13. This should also be done for the sake of the beautiful hymns, which we still have, read in the papacy, but not understood. 

Then one said: The song of Zachariah is fine. Yes, said D. Martin Luther, it is fine; for 


998 


The preface and foreword of Lucas indicates this when he says: "And Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit" 2c., Luc. 1, 67. 

We preachers and pastors are to watch and see to it that ceremonies are made and held in such a way that the people do not become so wild, nor too holy. Whoever wants to challenge a ceremony 1), let it be as small as it wants, must grasp the sword with both hands, not do as Erasmus, who only ridicules them, because they are foolish and ridiculous. But if one says against them, "God is also a fool, and gives foolish things, such as circumcision, sacrifices, the slaughter of Isaac 2c. 

How then, if such a foolish thing, which you ridicule, pleases God? Erasmus will never solve the argument, nor will he be embarrassed, because otherwise reason, when it comes and gets into divine things, despises them. He does not know the principium, the firm reason, namely, that one must insist on God's word and follow it. Only the article of justification by Christ must do it, otherwise the thought will always remain in the mind: "Perhaps...”. 


1) Thus it is correctly stated in the Duplicate Cap. 37, § 125 instead of "anrichten". 


Cap. 34: Ceremonies. § 5. 6. 


999 


why did you want to challenge it? Has not our Lord God commanded more foolish things? 

No one can withstand these arguments who cannot do more than Erasmus. The argument: "The church says it and admits it", repels them all. It is impossible that a believer could write as many books as Erasmus and not intersperse and mix in a few verses and testimonies of Christ. 


Omnis Spiritus laudat Dominum, ergo omni Lingua et Sermone est laudandus. (Cordatus No. 507. 497.) 


Let everything that has breath praise the Lord [Ps. 150:6], so let God be preached and praised in every language and speech. 

The emperor has decided that he wants to order that in all countries only Latin is to be prayed, read and mass is to be celebrated. He wants to forbid the dear Christ to speak, and although he understands all languages, he shall speak only in Latin. And in the Psalms it is said [Ps. 19, 4.]: "There is no language nor speech, where one does not hear their voice." The emperor says: You shall speak in Latin. Christ: let me speak as | will. So they are against each other. Which of the two will keep the victory?

2. abomination of the fair. (Cordatus No. 619.) 


No tongue can express the abomination of the Mass, no heart can properly sit it, and it would not have been surprising if God had corrupted the whole world for its sake, as [the devil] has certainly corrupted a great part of it through the trade of the Mass; but when he shall come with that fire [of Judgment Day], he will give him the due reward. 


3. great abuse and desecration of the Mass. 


Doctor Martin Luther told of a horrible profanation and desecration of the mass, which happened in Jtalia, where two mass ministers stand at the same time over an altar against each other and say mass: One turns towards the exit, the other towards the descent of the sun; the one reads the Gospel on this side, the other on the other side; they are finished in their craft, seek only their enjoyment and the dear penny, consider the Mass neither a sacrifice nor a sacrament, only they impudently look at its benefit; consider it a handling and a trade. The pope has seen and heard all these monstrous monstrosities, but has paid no attention to them, has let them happen; he must be either a gross ass or a devil in the flesh: an ass that he has not understood such errors; a devil that he has caused and defended such abominations. 


4th angle fair.

5. a different from the angle fair. (Lauterbach, Oct. 13, 1538, p. 149 f.) 


Afterwards, he spoke of the private mass and its superstitions, which were held in such high esteem that | would not have believed that only something of it would come to an end when | first wrote of the abdication of the mass. The Mass is the greatest acquisition and foundation of the pope. There was such a hearing of the Mass that if, for example, lords and mighty men had not heard the Mass in the morning, they had to have a dry Mass, all the prayers, the Epistle, the Gospel, the Canon and the consecrated host from the ciborium with the chalice, D. Basil replied: In France the prestige of the pope was not so great as it had been among the Germans, only the mass was still in bloom there, but in such a way that everyone daily devoutly heard one mass, after which they despised all other masses and passed by without reverence, and the king of France always gave a crown to the one who said it. Luther replied, "It is nevertheless very pleasing. For it seemed impossible to me in the beginning that the Mass should fall, which was founded in so many places and hearts. If the sacrament is done under both forms, the mass will not stand for long. Therefore, | would like to know if it is true that the bishop of Cologne allowed both forms. He is otherwise a good epicure; he believes as much as the See of Rome. 


6. from the Canon. 


The Canon in the Mass is cobbled together from many lies and is broken. The Greeks do not have it. |, said D. M. Luther, since

| was in Jtalia, 1) saw that those in Milan had no such Canonem. And when | wanted to say mass in that place, they said to me: Nos sumus Ambrosiani: We are Am. 

brosian; which also thus happened and is true. 

It is said that the Milanese disagreed with each other and quarreled whether they should accept Ambrosii's or Gregory's book in their church; they asked God to show them by a miracle. When they had placed both books in the church at night, they found Ambrosii's book on the high altar completely unbroken, but Gregory's book was torn into pieces and scattered from time to time. They interpreted this to mean that Ambrose should remain on the altar in Milan and Gregory should be scattered throughout the world. So the people of Milan hold it differently than the Roman church. 


7) Where the jewelry and clothing 2c. that are used in the monastery come from. 


The vestments, ornaments and clothing used at mass and other ceremonies in the priesthood are taken partly from Moses and partly from the pagans. For since the priests saw that the people were drawn to the market or playhouses by public spectacles and had a desire to do so, and that the churches remained desolate and empty as a result, they were moved and induced to set up and use such spectacles and jugglery in the church as well, so that the children and unlearned people would be moved and provoked to go to church all the better and watch such jugglery and folly. Just look at what they did on Easter evening for children's play and bragging. That pleased everyone, and would have been fine in part, if superstition had not been added to it. 

(This paragraph in Lauterbach, July 27, 1538, p. 103.) 


He told a story about when he was a young monk in Erfurt and went terminiren [begging] in a village, 


1) In 1510, when Luther was on his way back from Rome to Germany. Cf. Walch, old edition, vol. XX, 2227, § 71, where Luther reports the same. 


and when he was ready to celebrate Mass, the sexton began to sing to the lute: Kyrie eleison, and the Patrem. Then | had to sing the mass, although | could hardly contain myself from laughing, because | was not used to such organs. | had to direct my Gloria in excelsis after his Kyrie. 


8. the mass in the papacy the greatest service and good work. (Lauterbach, Dec. 5, 1538, p. 186.) 

On December 5, he said much about the exceedingly pernicious error of one's own righteousness, which has drawn even the best people away from the truth of God. The Jews performed their sacrifices ex opere operato, that they should be a propitiation and satisfaction, and that they should, as it were, throw a morsel to the enraged Cerberus [hound of hell]; since Christ alone is the right morsel, and all their sacrifices are euxapiot! [thank-offerings] and a Thanksgiving should have been. The papists' error of the sacrifice of the Mass ex opere operato, where an ignorant priest who does not understand Latin makes atonement for sins on behalf of others, is of this kind. Then Luther began to say many things about the abomination of the Mass, which imprisoned all people, both those who said it and those who were present. If a priest was put away from saying mass, it was his highest punishment, because saying mass was their one and only thing [fac totum]. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Mass is not abolished so quickly in England, because it has a great appearance. 


9. from the first meffe. (Lauterbach, Dec. 5, 1538, p. 186.) 

The first mass carried a lot of money, it was the right money network with sacrifices and gift. Then they put the Horas Canonicas with torches to the bridegroom. There the young lord had to have the first dance with his mother, if she was still alive, with great weeping of the spectators, as [when] Christ danced with his mother. When | held my first mass in Erfurt, | almost died because there was no faith, but | only looked at the worthiness of my person, so that | would not miss something and thereby sin. 


1004 Cap. 35. of Messt. §10-13. 1005 


10. what belongs to a papist mass. 


To the papist mass must belong the character, the mark that one was smeared and consecrated, and an altar stone. If one was only a priest and could say mass for the dead, that could feed him, because it was a rich fair that carried much profit. But if one had a mass for the Virgin Mary, he was well off. 


11. ignorance of the measuring monkeys. (Lauterbach, Dec. 18, 1538, p. 193.) 


There was talk about the mass priests of the Italians and France, who were completely clumsy and unlearned, because they were completely uneducated, did not understand Latin and lived only from the continuation of the masses. They far surpass our German priests in ignorance. How many sacraments are there? Three. Which ones? The sprinkler, the censer and the crucifix. The one can be enough for you. If someone was ordained and could say three Masses, it was enough: 1) The Requiem [for the dead], 2) of the Blessed Virgin, for all Sundays, 3) of the Trinity or of the Holy Cross 2c. Great was the blindness, unfortunately, and if the days had not been shortened, we would all have become senseless. But | fear it will be worse after us, because of the great contempt of the Word. For princes and cities take little notice of the holy religion, let everything go, punish no evil. Very dangerous times will follow. In short, the world is a strange lot. May our Lord God put an end to it. 


12. whether the mass is a sacrifice. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 537.) 

At the Diet of Augsburg, the papists insisted that we should agree that the Mass was a sacrifice of praise, so that they might make do with the word sacrifice, and they were disgraced. But | would have gladly conceded this, if they also wanted to allow each communicant to sacrifice. 

The mass must be aborted, primarily for two reasons: The first, so also 


reason can judge that it is shameful handling and dishonest enjoyment to sell a mass for a penny or eight pennies. The other is judged by the spirit, namely, that it is an abominable idolatry, that with it the whole Christ is destroyed and buried, because they want to do enough for sin with it, just for the sake of the work, if only that was done. 

These two abuses cannot excuse them at all, that is certain; although all universities have conspired, consented and sworn together to defend and preserve this abomination. For this reason, we cannot easily come to terms with the papists, nor can we agree with them; for if they were to drop and abolish the private and anglican mass, they would have to restitute and restore everything that they have lied about, stolen, and snatched away from princes, lords, and the people with the mass. 

There has not been a prince in the papacy who said, "My endowment is to be made for the sake of poor virgins, to endow them honestly, but only for the forgiveness of sins; for thus read and testify all the letters and seals of princes. | would rather let no peasant give anything to the priests, monks, and the spiritless; indeed, | would much rather suffer Turks and Tarterns than that the mass should remain. But the world is blind, it lboks askance, 1) when one takes a monastery; since it, the world, eats nothing more, 2) than the drunkenness given to the sows. 

The Mass is a twofold impiety and abomination: first, it is a theological blasphemy; second, it is a political sin, namely, a fraud and theft. 


13. the mass is the biggest service among the whales. (Lauterbach, Feb. 2, 1538, p. 19.') 

Doctor Schneidewein said: That the Italians were Lutherans in many ways and that they easily assaulted him. If you had not attacked the mass, there would be a great coincidence in Italy. But to reject the mass is in their ears the greatest abomination, because they are so attached to 


1) So Stangwald instead of: "stale". 2) So Stangwald instead of: "is".

The people are attached to this service, that whoever has heard a mass on one day is without danger and cannot sin. Therefore, the greatest sins and murders happen after they have heard the mass. That is why, after hearing the mass, they let out their long- cherished hatred and resentment in murder. For someone who, after two years of hatred and resentment, could not meet his enemy with [all] reenactments, seized him in the church under the Mass, killed him, and fled. After that, Luther said: "The book of the abbatial Mass is quite harsh, written against the blasphemous adversaries. It is not for the beginners, they are annoyed by it. For whoever should have taken the mass from me twenty years ago should also have come [together] with me in great numbers, for | revered it with all my heart.

Missa, the Mass, comes from the Ebraic word Maosim, which means gathered alms, donation or tax, for the sake of the priests or poor people.

Just as no one can say how ungodly a desecration of the sanctuary the mass is, so no one can say how much money it has lost and how much money has been lost through it. 


The 36th chapter. 


Of Purgatory. 


(Lauterbach, Jan. 10, 1538, p. 6 f.) 


A Hungarian asks Luthern for advice. On this day a student came to him to ask him for advice because of some doubts, and quoted from the Loci communes of Johann Eck, first: Of Purgatory, since he had proven it from the Fathers. Luther answered: Neither Ambrose, nor Augustine, nor Jerome give an opinion about Purgatory, but Gregory was deceived by visions and taught something about Purgatory, since God forbade to inquire about spirits, but one should ask Moses and the prophets; therefore, in this respect, nothing is to be believed in St. Gregory. Eck and others understand this passage of St. Paul in the First Epistle to the Corinthians [3, 13]: "The day will make it clear" 2c., of Purgatory, since this passage says nothing about Purgatory, but about the doctrine and the good and evil life of the pious and the heretics. For Arius has had his day. All heretics have had their day and their judgment. But the fire of faith has revealed it, just as the last day will reveal everything. In short: God has revealed to us in his word 





He presents two ways: salvation through faith and damnation through unbelief. He says nothing of purgatory, and one must not admit purgatory because it obscures the benefits and grace of Christ. That there is a purgatory in this world could be admitted in a certain sense. 

The second question was whether the departed saints intercede and pray for us. Luther answered: We may allow them to pray. But both their life and their prayer are unknown to us; nor can we know how their death is a life. It may be objected that St. Ambrose prayed for the Emperor Theodosius after his death, but this is attributed to him. Augustine may have asked for his mother Monica, but he does not claim anything about it, and he does not want his writings to be kept if they do not agree with the holy scripture, as he says: "I do not want my writings to be kept" 2c. In short, we must cling to God's bright word, not to human opinions. 1)

In 1521, that Marcus approached me with very

But he said: In seven years you will see signs. And soon the peasants’ revolt followed. He said, among other things, that he could see immediately by sight whether a man was devout or ungodly and not chosen. That means to get lost with words. This man spoke strangely dark words: coarseness, meanness, boredom, and when | asked him how people could understand him when he spoke like that, he answered that he only preached to gifted disciples who had the pound. And when | asked him about my pound, he said that | was in the first degree of mobility and would yet come to the first degree of immobility, in which he was, and since he had sent a letter and admonition from Kemberg with very kind words, he said that | was in the first degree of immobility.

150 D. Luther's Answer, Given to a Wise Man. 


| said, "Goodbye, dear Marcus. 

Drechsler said he had a message to him from his father. | [asked him]: Who is your father?-He: Jesus Christ. - He is my father, too. What then is the message? - That God is angry with the world. - Me: Where did he tell you that?-He: Outside the city, when | went out of the gate, | saw a very small cloud, which is a sign of the wrath of God. And in my sleep | saw the drunkards saying: It is true, it is true, and the hand of God upon them, and when one of them poured a candelabra of beer upon my neck, | awoke. | scolded him that he would not play his game with the name of God. But he went away and said: Whoever does not say what Luther wants must be a fool. 


2nd Rotten are proud and presumptuous. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1062.) Martin Cellarius, a very godless knave, also wanted to deceive me by flattery, for he said that my profession was greater than the 


1012 


the apostles. But | said to him: Oh, what am I against the apostles! He wrote me four sextons about the tabernacle of Moses, but when | did not want to believe his flattery, he insulted me more than he had praised me [before]. To this | said: Go and do what you want. 

Another from the Netherlands also came to me and wanted to argue with me until the fire, since he was quite unlearned. | said to him, "Let's argue about a candel of beer or two," and he went away again, for the devil, as a proud spirit, cannot stand to be despised. 


3. of sacramentaries. (Cordatus No. 1063. 1064. 1) 

When Bucer conferred with me at Coburg about the Lord's Supper and finally asked whether the sacrament was also given to the ungodly, I told him whether the ungodly could also hear the word of God and misuse it. After he left, he wrote me these words: "Do not doubt that we teach the same things that you teach. But it has come into denial, as H[erzog] G[eorg], they cannot go back. 

Oecolampad and Zwingli said they had to keep peace with me because | had been the first to preach the gospel, but after my death they wanted to make their opinion known. But they did not know that they would die before Luther. 


4. from Carlstadt. (Cordatus No. 1495.) 

Everything that Carlstadt also started, he started for the sake of vain honor", because he let himself think that there was no scholar from earth, but he. And what | also wrote, he imitated, but gave it another coat of paint. He wanted to be alone, and | would have gladly given way to him, but | could not do it without doing injustice to God. | have never used any audacity or presumption in writing, even when | wanted to begin; for | thought so when | saw the abomination of indulgences: | will write about this evil thing,

§ 2-5. 1013 After that, others will come and write about other errors; there would probably be other people who would know how to lead it out better. This | thought to myself, although by the grace of God | am more learned than all sophistical doctors or theologians. 


5. about Campano and his rapture. (Cordatus No. 762. 957. 958. 959. 179.) 

Campanus is an extremely bad man, and he must not be confronted soon; for, if one wrote against him, he would only become more audacious. He must only be suppressed with contempt, and his opinions will go no further. 

Campanus falls into these questions as a young and untrained man, much more because he thinks he understands more Greek than Luther or Pomeranus. He has not experienced any challenge and yet he boasts of plerophoria [complete certainty] and boasts that he can describe the Godhead more clearly than John, and condemns me as a liar because | teach a weak faith that must grow and increase day by day through struggle. 

Campanus describes a Christian as a perfect saint; but | say that a Christian is a wretched sinner, afflicted by various lusts, who feels human 2) inclinations about him. This is how Paul clung to Epaphroditus. Campanus, however, makes men into sticks, like the Stoics. If | were such a man, | would soon be baptized four times over. 

If we could be as sure and certain of our faith as Campanus speaks of the Christians, | would not give one lighter around the sermon and sacrament. 

No mortal can ever speak with such art and put his words so eloquently as the apostles. Therefore, Campanus is a worthless man who imagines that he can speak more clearly of the Godhead 3) than John himself in his Gospel. 

(Here 24 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 4, § 23.)

keep stiffly over their rapture, and that it also goes away. (Contained in Cap. 2, § 39.) 


7. from the Rottengeister ambition. 


(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Dec. 12, 1538, p. 190.) 

After that he talked about Carlstadt's and M. B(ucer's) arrogance, which would have greatly hindered the course of the gospel. For in other arts, professions and gifts, it is more appropriate to be proud. In theology it is the very most harmful thing to presume. For the heavens shall tell the glory of GOD and not their own; GOD alone the glory! (Ps. 19, 2.) Therefore | was very frightened when Carlstadt said these words: "I like to have honor as much as another." He did not want to give me precedence in the disputation at Leipzig, so that | would not deprive him of the honor that | nevertheless gladly granted him. But he put honor to shame at Leipzig because he is a very unfortunate disputator and has an awkward, ponderous mind. He had a particularly pleasant subject, but left it to me to dispute Eck's last theses on the primacy of the pope and on Johannes Huss. Eck, however, a domineering man, yes, an impudent and shameless one, obtained for me a safe stay and safe conduct with Duke Georg in Leipzig, so that | could debate with him; otherwise | had only come to Leipzig under the wing of Carlstadt. Carlstadt and Peter Lupinus were very vehemently hostile to me in the early days of the Gospel; but when | overcame them in the disputation and laid them down with Augustine's writings, they, after reading Augustine, became more vehement in this matter than | was. But the dreadful hope deceived the Carlstadt. 

We must, said Martinus, have something new every year: Two years ago there were the murderers, this year there was the patricidal war, which the papists wrought through their French G. of K., 1) 


1) Instead of "welschen G. von K." Bindseil II, 31: Herzog Georg.

Thus, D. J[eckel] is also setting up a game for us at F.; he wants to ponder and scout according to my letters, which | wrote to D. H. W. 2) especially and secretly, he wants to ponder and scout. But his horns shall be scraped, since he will not stop. Now V. Ammerbach is also rebelling against us, daring to rebuke our teachings and the priests’ marriage. 

Oh, the shameful mobs do great harm to the gospel, even among foreign nations; therefore the adversaries blaspheme us. For a French scout told me roundly and expressly, as his king would be, quite eloquently, that we respected neither religion, nor police, nor secular regiment, nor marriage, but that everything went wildly astray, like cattle. 

In addition, Carlstadt and Zwingel are brazen and defiant; for Zwingel may boast publicly and say: We want to have France, Hispania and England on our side and our part in three years. Thus, N. N. 3) has had his books carried from Switzerland into France under our name, so that many cities are still contaminated and polluted with them. And the city of N. N. is also not yet pure, only that they simulate under the appearance of protection and keep behind the mountain. But | have greater hope for those in Strasbourg. 


8. you have to condemn the spirits of the rotten, who otherwise proclaim their masters to be saints. (Contained in § 18 of this Cap.) 


9. red spirits are ambitious. (Cordatus No. III3.) 


How is it possible that all the rotas speak: It is I? They want to be alone and have the honor all alone and hate others. And the Sacramentarians and Anabaptists hate me more than the pope, and the pope is more hostile to me than to them, and all at the same time dispute the gospel.

15. by Witzel. 


D. Martinus said: Witzel is not worthy that | would write against him, lest he be strengthened in his wickedness. For | have experienced that those who have fallen away from us have become the most miserable people, since there is no heart, joy or courage in them. Nothing is there, because a bitter heart, which would gladly go by force and avenge itself, have no good hour. So | am not, praise God, that | would spoil my rest, food, drink and joy for the sake of the pope. But they are serpents, raised among us, they have laid aside all human affections and love, they do not take care of the needs of others. 


16) Why Georg Witzel fell away from the Gospel again. 


D. M. Luther said that D. Gregorius Brick, Saxon chancellor, would have kept Georgium Wicelium alive: because he would have been a beginner with the rebellion in Thuringia, therefore, when he was caught, one should have beheaded him: Then D. Brick would have asked for him. When he came to us in Wittenberg, | appointed him pastor of the Niemeck parish, which is now held by Conradus Cordatus. But since he then attached himself to the Campanum, wrote together, and was a cake with each other, and disputed the article of the divinity of Christ, which Dominus Philippus Melanchthon first learned and required the Campanum to do, and he pretended such terrible blasphemy; then Elector Hans went to, and had Witzel caught and put ina tower; but we theologians knew nothing about it. Then Witzel fell away from us and attached himself to the pope again, and has now become our worst enemy, but he will also get his modest share. 


17. gushers do not answer correctly. 1) 


On May 9, Johannes Cellarius, preacher at B[autzen], came to D. Martino, and told him much of his f[rankfurters], 2) who, whether they were well acquainted with the doctrine of the Gospel, were

asks to answer; but they confessed nothing freely, kept flour in their mouths all the time, their answer would be: Well, well. Then said D. Martinus said: "It is true that they do not give a correct, round answer; they are such that they may not confess what they believe: they are quite Erasmian, and their words are screwed, as it is now called, and doubtful, which can be interpreted and understood as one likes, from which nothing certain can actually be taken. (The following Cordatus No. 1683.) 

| can also drink, laugh, and make fun, but what is or must be done by the word, no one vexes me, and | let a lot of laughter. In Strasbourg, even when Bucer ruled there, the words "this is my body" and "this is my blood" were omitted when, as is the custom, the words of Holy Communion were read out in a very loud voice, and yet he wrote to me in the meantime, since | contradicted him and did not want to do everything that suited him: Martine, if you are not in earnest, it is better that we remain enemies than that we form a fictitious friendship. Isn't that playing at sacred things? This was said to me by someone who was present at her main service [missae]. 


18. God punishes the despisers and blasphemers of the Word. (Cordatus No. 1075. 1076. 1077.) 

The despisers of the Word perish in misery, soon here, soon there, for God is a just judge and His judgment is right. He proves this now, just as in Hamburg, where an outstanding despiser of the Word, who had turned many away, finally fell into despair, which no one could take away from him. And he said, My sin is greater than that it could obtain forgiveness, because he had deceived many. This man broke out of the house by force and threw himself into a well in broad daylight. 

It is terrible enough not to believe God's words, but how terrible it is to despise and laugh at the word! (Marcius mensis Mara et mors est.) 3) 

3) The bracketed words are probably, with Mr. D. 


Wrampelmeyer, to be taken for an addition to the cordatus. Therefore, we do not consider it necessary to add a

20. D. Zochen's Conversion and Opinion of the Sacramentarians. 


(Cordatus No. 536.) 


Carlstadt was very presumptuous to have been allowed to discuss in Rome in the most distinguished college, in domo Sapientiae. 


In any case, it is a somewhat forced explanation to give them aj relation to the predicted. Translated they read: The month of March is Mars and death. 


1022 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 21-24. 1023 


After that, he became a farmer out of loud envy, went bareheaded, and did not want to be called a doctor, but rather neighbor Enders. 

Oecolampadius was a kind man at first, but afterwards he was bitter and harsh. Zwingel was a cheerful, polite collation man, but became so dark and sad afterwards. 

Campanus came to Marburg and wanted to disputate with me, could not do dialecticam, and nevertheless wanted to defend his delusion and fancy hopefully and measurably; said that neither Luther, nor Zwingel, nor Oecolampadius, nor the pope had not taught correctly about the Lord's Supper, because he did not ask about figures or tropes and made a new way of speaking; said that it was a bread literal body. And he was very angry that he was not called to Marburg and allowed into the chamber for disputation and discussion. Such fellows are blinded by the devil. But Bucer and Capito are very friendly, kind and mediators, and would like to set things right, but it cannot happen so soon. There has been great trouble in France and Italy with the letter about the Lord's Supper in the upper country. The cause, raised against the papacy, went off well; but the enthusiasts, Carlstadt, Miinzer, Zwingel and their ilk, also wanted to hunt for honor, fished only in front of the hame, and thus promoted the papacy. 


22. sacramentirans are godless. 


Godless is called and is the one who denies God, which are the sacrament-riders: because they deny the essence and the custom of the sacrament. The others, who only deny the custom of the sacrament, are not godless, but are weak in faith. 


(23) Which are the best preachers among the enthusiasts. 


Among the gushers, these are the best preachers that these four pieces can probably do: One, don't put on achoir robe. The other, no chasuble. The third, not to think anything of confession. And the fourth, that in the Sacrament 


of the altar is nothing but bread and wine. Just as with the papists, who are smeared and shamed by bishops, they are held in high esteem, even though they are the most unlearned and rude asses. That is why St. James rightly says in his epistle that in the last times the person will be considered. 


(24) The swarmers do not want to have erred, but to have done right. 


Anno 1536, the 25th of August, D. Martin's letters came from M. Bucero, in which he asked the Doctor to write to the Swiss and to send them the Notel of Concord, as they had compared themselves with each other. Then spoke D. Martinus: "I do not know what to write, they only seek a cover with our letter to embellish their cause, and yet they do not want to confess their errors: they pretend and boast as if neither part had understood the other; 1) which | did not want to suffer, nor do | want the blame to come upon me that | should not have understood their opinion and opinion. Oh Lord God, she is too clearly understood. Why did | write so harshly against her if I did not understand? But | would gladly do so, if they confessed their errors, then | would also confess that | had been vehement and bitter against them. But | do not like this proposition that no one should have understood the other. It shall be said of me even after my death. For | have always been hostile to such mediations. And | have asked them more than ten times, since they did not seek right, pure, true unity, they should leave it at the first dissension and disagreement, until they bled themselves to death. | do not want to burden myself with other people's sins, so that | extinguish a little spark in them and make a big fire in us. God protect me from that. 

| have always taught God's word with simplicity; | will stay with it and give myself up to it; or | will become a pope who believes neither in the resurrection of the dead nor in eternal life. They have written only what is according to reason, that

1024 


In the sacrament one receives bread and wine, not the body and blood; but the body and blood are eaten and drunk with faith and spirit alone, but with the mouth only bread and wine. 

There can be no real true unity, because they measure this thing only with reason. | would gladly die if we could win back the church in Switzerland and the cities and bring it back into line, then the pope and the emperor would be afraid of us. But one should not trust in people, yes, one should let people go. They are looking for my words in the most precise and quickest way. | alone promised to do the best in the matter. They want to catch me with their words, they think. Oh no, | do not want to hand over God's word, | did not want to do it either in Augsburg or in Worms, since they also wanted to persuade me to hand over the matter. However, | would rather recite my escort and hand it over, at great risk to life and limb, than abandon my teaching, yes, God's word, and hand it over to people. 


25. complaint D. Martini about the gushers. (Lauterbach, April 22, 1538, p. 68.) 

Afterwards he sighed: "Ah, Carlstadt and Minzer have greatly hindered the Gospel. The Sacramentarians have gradually retreated. First, they taught nothing but bread and wine; second, spiritually, i.e. speculatively, there is body and blood; third, bodily, but it is received with faith. These are vain philosophical thoughts. For the articles of faith are against all philosophy, geometry, and arithmetic, yea, against all creature. Itis, itis not, that no one can rhyme together. That is why the landgrave, who once favored Zwingli, wanted to establish unity among us, that we should call each other brothers; but | did not want to, although Zwingli said with tears that he wished to remain in our church, and that no separation would arise among us. And | hope that he has been punished in time and has changed his mind. There will always be dangers. 


1) This is part of Luther's conversation with M. Simon Sulcer, Superintendent at Bern, Cap. 22, § 45. 


Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 24-26. 


1025 


We will not be overtaken by our golden friends. We will not be overtaken by our golden friends, since Christ suffered such things. 


The trouble caused by the swarms does great harm. 


D. Martinus said to the messenger whom the Swiss had sent to him: He still hoped good to them, that they would let go of the opinion and thought, sucked from reason, namely, of bringing Christ down and up from the right hand into the bread. Of this we have never taught; but have badly and simple- mindedly believed that the true body and blood of Christ is in the bread and wine, without ascending and descending; otherwise we could not believe any article of faith, of the holy Trinity and incarnation of the Son, as the middle person, if we would take reason with its wisdom to counsel. 

Oh, dear God, this trouble hinders many people. When the teachers disagree among themselves in doctrine, because one pretends this and the other that, and do not teach from one heart and mouth, this pushes many people over the head, so that they go astray and do not know whom to believe. Dear, what do you think that the Jews, who had been placed in the most beautiful kingdom or regiment and priesthood of God, were annoyed and displeased when they saw that righteousness was offered and given to all without distinction, free of charge, out of pure grace, without any merit, and the Gentiles were supposed to be like them? What thinkest thou that the Roman empire and empire, which was the most powerful, and had the wisest men, and walked in its divine services in fine order, should have thought that they should be ruled by a foolish nation of Jews, by strange, weird, monstrous, and superstitious fables (as they called and blasphemed the faith in Christ crucified)? Such astonishments have always caused the gospel to be persecuted, as is also happening today. What blasphemy and slanderous lies are thought and said about the true pure doctrine of faith and the church? as if we were heretics, rebels 2c. It is still going on.

The gushers' presumption and presumption of hope. (Lauterbach, Sept. 26, 1538, p. 136.) 


Zwingli was a very cheerful, open-hearted man, but after his fall he fell into such presumption that he dared to say and write: | hold that no man in the world has believed that the Body and Blood of Christ are in the Sacrament. He dared to speak this against the knowledge of almost all men, and so he perished miserably, like Egranus, the impetuous man. 


28. by M. Eisleben. (Lauterbach, Nov. 29, 1538, p. 182.) 


On the November before last he was merry with his paternal brothers, his brother and sisters, his blood relatives, and when they had mentioned J. A[gricola) they wanted to put in a good word for him; but he replied: | have taken this person for my most faithful friend, who has so injured me by his deceit that | can never again exclude him in the number of my intimates. | will write against him shortly. He may be provided with it, because there is no repentance, but a man with a very insolent forehead.

(Transferirt according to Cap. 45, § 58, to which this § is excluded by Lauterbach). 


30. from arch-heretics. 


There was talk of arch-heretics, in the presence of D. Erasmi Alben, who was called to Brandenburg. 1) Said D. Martinus: Erasmus Roterodamus has passed away and died, like a good epicure, without sacrament; God also help N. N. that it is his earnest. Eisleben remains obdurate and a sly, treacherous mocker who can simulate and pretend. That is why | did not want to receive him when he came here. And | said to the margrave: He was not yet reconciled with me; | wanted to

would gladly forgive him, if he were sorry. Then the margrave said to the doctor: If only he were serious. D. Martinus answered: "I will let the Lord take care of that. It is very burdensome and annoying to learn such things from the household. But Judas solves this argument, since Christ said to him: O Juda, you betray the Son of Man with the kiss! So we have to experience the gloss and learn to understand it. 

Such a fellow is also D. Jeckel, who now lies in Leipzig and is despised by everyone, because he is said to be able to do more than preach. He asked for my little girl, Anna Sfchiitzmeister], 2) free; but | told him: This shall not happen for eternity. And to the maiden: If you want to have it, then lift yourself up from me immediately, | will neither hear nor see you. It was the same with the mayor H. K., when he was courting his daughter. 


Ambition spoils everything. (Contained in Cap. 22, K 110.) 


32. comparison of the "Papilio", two-folders or summer birds, with the swarmers. 


A Papilio or summer bird is generated in the following way: First it is a caterpillar and hangs on a wall somewhere, gains a little house; then in spring, when the sun shines warmly, the house breaks open and a Papilio flies out. When it wants to die again, it sits down on a tree or leaf, presses a long tract of eggs from itself, from which young caterpillars emerge. So it is generatio reciproca, it is first a caterpillar, and becomes a caterpillar again. | have found varia genera of caterpillars in my garden; | believe that the devil brought them to me. First of all, they have horns in the nose 2c. But they are actually the hawkmoths. For the caterpillars have beautiful, silver, golden stripes, glisten and seem pretty; but inside they are full of poison. The enthusiasts pretend to be pious and holy, but they have false, erroneous and seductive teachings. And 


2) Seidemann: Lauterbach p. 2. 


1028 


When summer birds die, they leave many eggs behind, and one caterpillar becomes many other caterpillars. Thus, one hawkmoth seduces many people, and from it grows more hawkmoths and red spirits. 

At another time, M. Luther called the Rottengeisters, who were clowns and wise men, untimely and immature saints, who would soon become worm-eaten and fall under the tree by a soft wind. 


33: Of Antinomians and Lawbreakers. From Eisleben. 


My best friends, said D. Martinus with great sighing, want to trample me underfoot, and smear and turbulence the gospel; therefore | will undertake a disputation, to provoke the opposite, that they must come out into the light. And since they humbly offer themselves and surrender, | will not be satisfied with their pretense and hypocrisy, but will drive them either to oppose, or to preside and answer their propositions and pretensions. No, it is not a matter of joking. It is not for our name and glory, but for the glory of Christ. 

And he continued with great sorrow in his heart: "Oh, what a pity it is when one loses a good friend whom he loves very much! | had this one (Eisleben) at the table, he was my good companion, who laughed with me and was cheerful: nevertheless he is backwards against me; | cannot tolerate that, he can never receive it. For it is gross error to reject the law. If other errors and vexations would go, it would be easier; but to reject the law, without which neither the church, nor the secular and domestic government, nor any man can be and exist, is to push the bottom out of the barrel. It's time to fight: | can't stand it, and | don't like it. 

After that the doctor said: "Oh, how kindly and with a gentle spirit | punished him; but how deceitfully and treacherously he answered me! Oh the shameful hopefulness and presumption, what harm does it do! it is a mother of all heresy. Now would be the time to sing the Te Deum laudamus

singing and thanking God, it becomes a time of quarreling and bickering. Fie on you - there is no error so gross that does not have listeners! | must see that they still strut in my life and want to rule. As St. Paul says to the Corinthians (1 Ep. 4, 8.): "Would to God that you reigned without me." The good Paul had to see many of these things; as God speaks, Apost. 9, 16: "I will show you what you must suffer for my name's sake." Soon he was subjected to pati and suffering, and experienced it well; which suffering and heartache was also more bitter than death. It is called a martyrdom inter- pretativum, spiritual suffering, which happens without blood, in which one roasts and fears. | also have to suffer this in such astonishments and presumption of my disciples and pupils, that | would much rather suffer death and end with my blood 2c. Then he said to those who were at his table: "Pray for the peace of the church against these troubles. | am deceived, as Christ cries out in the Psalm against Judah. The adversaries do not do such great harm, but those who want to be out of us and cause trouble are the most harmful. 

It is altogether too coarse and much to reject Moses. If he had taught another repentance, which concerns the police, outward good manners and discipline, not the repentance of the churches; that would still have to be suffered. And it is not enough that he apologizes and says that he meant D. Creuziger and M. RG6rer; for the Catechism, the interpretation of the Ten Commandments, and the Augsburg Confession are mine, not Creuziger's or Rorer's. Since he wants to teach repentance out of love of righteousness, he only preaches the revelation of wrath to the righteous and pious; to the ungodly he preaches nothing. Since St. Paul says 1 Tim. 1, 9: "The law is given to the unrighteous". Summa, he opens windows and doors to all safety: for he who abolishes the law also abolishes the gospel. He casts out our doctrine from the comfort of conscience to the will of the flesh. | would not have done such a thing to him, if he had been able to talk to me about it every day and tell me what his opinion would be if he had a little Christian heart. 


1030 


34. a different one from M. E. (Lauterbach, 3, Feb. 1538, p. 22.) 

Afterwards they discussed many things about J. Agricola, who in great presumption wanted to be [it] alone and tower over all others by his proud behavior, but he is well hewn. And the prince ordered today that he should be admitted publicly to the sermons in order to investigate it, and he had it announced to me [Lauterbach] and the other deacons that we should admit him. | indicated Pomer's order, otherwise we wanted gladly. [Luther] answered: The prince's command goes over Pomerania. He does not insist on it without cause. He does not give him so much pay for nothing, therefore he wants him to be sincere. Amsdorf, however, could not turn his suspicion away from him, because he could cover up many things by dissimulation and leave many things unsaid in speech. Luther answered: We will watch him and force him to teach clearly. And if he does not teach the affirmative opinion [affirmativam sententiam] of the law, then watch him. | have preserved him jetzunder, he would otherwise be gone. Oh, how many pains and struggles of soul | have had in this matter, that | have experienced this annoyance, that he in whom | have placed my trust, whom | have favored, defended, elevated, who [sat] mildly and meekly at my table, has willed otherwise than he showed. If it were weakness, it could be borne; but since it is willful malice, it is appalling. | am not a martyr as far as blood is concerned, but what temptations | have had in this matter, God knows. | would have almost died of fear before | managed to write the theses. | wanted to come to his aid and [ward off] the arousal. Oh God, it is unfortunate to seek one's honor in theology; this ambition is a consuming fire. As Christ says, John 5:23, "He honoureth not him that sent me." The holy Scriptures are given for the dishonor of the flesh, and we great fools want to seek our glory in them. Every other kind of courting, among physicians, philosophers, poets and artists, among beautiful young people, is tolerable because it can be easily changed. A girl who imagines something out of her beauty will be

A disease humbles. But the abominable presumption in theology is the source of all kinds of evils and a consuming fire. 1) Let us ask God. 


35. a different. (Lauterbach, Aug. 18, 1538, p. 114.) 


On August 18, he wondered at the presumption and vanity of J. Agricola, who presumed to bring about a reign with his very insipid thoughts, and in the meantime hindered the cause of the Gospel. Philip answered: This is the complaint at all times; for all difficult tasks have few helpers, but many who hinder them, and yet God goes forward in the weakness of the few, against the hindrances of the many. To this Luther said: Who would have thought of this sect of the antinomians? | have experienced three horrible weathers, Coiners, that of the Sacramentalists and the Anabaptists. Through these senseless people, other [weather] comes into being. So there will be no end to writing. | do not wish to live longer now, because there is no peace to hope for. The ancients may have said, like Bernhard, that four things must be preached: Virtues, vices, rewards, threats. And that is very well said. But the wisdom of the antinomians is much different. Verse: 


Indocto tria sunt recte inculcanda popello: Virtus cum vitiis; his addes praemia, poenas, [i.e. To the unlearned people three things are to be properly impressed: Virtues, vices, rewards and punishments]. 

2) J. Justus Jonas said to D. M. Luthern: M. Eisleben Oportet will do it, and told how he used to say, the mush 3) must be gone: it is salted, we do not want it. Then D. Luther said: He must eat the mush again, | will salt it for him so that he would spit over it. 

On this Philip Melanchthon made this verse: 

Arator quoties miserandum portat oportet, Ipse sui fastus non bene portat onus.

What can one say, it is Satan's deceit, which makes all godless, secure preachers to proud, hopeful, glorious Thrasones, as if they seek only God's glory, and the people's salvation and bliss. 


39. a different one from M. Eisleben. 


Anno 1539, on April 19, V. Martinus seriously ordered M. Ambrosio Bernd that he, as a master, wanted to indicate to the professoribus in the university that they should not become factiosi and cause division or separation, but keep the right order. And forbade that M. Eisleben should not be elected dean, lest his presumption, presumptuousness and disobedience should thereby be confirmed and strengthened: for he is a most insolent and hopeless enemy of the churches, schools, and all of us; thus we should have a serpent in our bosom, which should not be cauterized and fed with milk, but with earth, unless he righteously converts and corrects himself. Tell this to your facultists, but if they will not do it, | will preach against them publicly. 

| am afraid of nothing more than of our ingratitude, which will now be greatly increased, grow and increase by the antinomian doctrine and hypocrisy: for they promise people everything beyond the cross in the most certain way; make good raw, wild companions out of them; write and carve a god and conscience for them themselves, according to their sense and pleasure. 

Oh, that we could recognize our sin and only cry out to God: God, have mercy on me; then the matter would be helped. For our Lord God can certainly give us something to be thankful for, even if we are sinners: if we only repent, confess it and let us be sorry from the bottom of our hearts, and hold on to faith alone in Christ crucified, then all is forgiven, simple and just. But the poisonous doctrine of the antinomians enters gently, tastes good to flesh and blood, is delicately sweet: it will do great harm. If God wanted D. Pommer to be here now, | would attack the hypocrite, Eisleben, with the judgment of the church and put him under ban: for his feigning and hypocrisy, that he poses as a friend, and yet is an enemy, is very wicked.

40. by D. Jakob Schenk. (Lauterbach, Jan. 10, 1538, p. 5.) 


Letter of Jak. Schenk against the preaching of the law. - A letter he had written to his pastors was shown, in which he completely rejects the preaching of the law as unnecessary, because it would be obvious to human reason. But the gospel, which is above all understanding of reason, must always be preached, and that in the sweetest way, because Christ commanded Peter: Feed, feed, feed my sheep, not slaughter them, nor kill them. And it would not be advisable for a preacher to blaspheme in his sermons because of a few ungodly people, and in the meantime miss the whole church. The ungodly must be admonished privately and reported to the authorities. Luther replied: "| have yet to see such monsters in my lifetime. Without my advice, the Elector had that Magister Karg 2) imprisoned, because he saw Satan's game among them, that one might sing at the other. 3) Perhaps all of this is done against the future aggravations for the glory of Christ and the gospel. 

After that, anew motet was sung, namely, "My soul has become joyful." He remarked: "They have given the most beautiful joyful notes to the songs of the Virgin Mary, just as the young journeymen sing their metz [girls] most joyfully; so they have invented everything for the glory of Mary. 





41 Another of the same. 


D. Martinus wrote to D. Jakob Schenk, and admonished him the last time thus: Although 


1) Bindseil 11, 76: cristarn; in Aurifaber and Stangwald "fight".

On June 20, the wife of the prince of Freiberg, 1) ke Heinrich, came to Wittenberg, with whom Luther ce discussed the pride and arrogance of Doctor Jakobi, and admonished her that she should be careful about the aggravations of the church 2c. There were also councilors from Freiberg who wanted to appoint another, and denounced Jakob's ungodliness and separation, because he had publicly taught carnal freedom: Do what you want, only believe, and you will be saved. Luther answered: It is badly distinguished, 42. the sins are to be distinguished. but one turns it around: Dear man, believe in God, and afterwards, as a born-again, new man, then do what

When the doctor heard this, he was frightened, sighed, kept silent, and prayed. And the same day he ordered to act with Eisleben, so that he would either publicly recant or be disgraced. 


46. D. J[eckel's] false delusion. 


D. Jakob S[chenk] 3) fraudulently boasted how he was one with the Wittenbergers. Then said D. Martinus said: "| must take him for my friend, and believe this, even though | have to protect him with letters and seals.

and covered them, indicating the wickedness of his spirit, and was finally about to tie up with Luther when he left. 


Fortune beguiles the people. (Lauterbach, Sept. 15, 1538, p. 132.) 


Afterwards, D. Jonas said a lot about the tremendous court life of J. A[gricola] and J. S[chenk], that they had done great things. He answered: Ah, how great is the corruption in man, since he degenerates more even through good days than through the cross! For these people have got into such great hope only through prosperity, presuming as inexperienced people everything and presuming that they, as idle and boastful people, would rule in what we have worked out. There should follow a beautiful church. The Catechism would have perished in the Church long ago, which we still preach with the greatest benefit. God keep us in the purity of his teaching. 


The devil can suffer that one preaches Christ with the mouth, but does not punish with what is to be punished 2c. 


In 1538, September 18, when J. Schenk was 

being praised and extolled everywhere as a pure teacher of the Gospel, who finely comforted consciences, D. Martinus said: "Oh, how | would like to hear this testimony from him, if only he did not speak such sweet and smooth words, as St. Paul did to the Romans in chapter 16. Martinus said: "Oh, how | would like to hear this testimony from him, if only he did not speak such sweet-mouthed, smooth, splendid words; as St. Paul complains to Romans Cap. 16, 18, which are the greatest deceivers, like the wind of Caecia, which blows so gently, softly and warmly, so that the blossoms are lured out to their destruction. So does the devil, who intends to destroy Christ, even though he teaches Christ and lies, even though he speaks the truth. A pious man may go up the stairs, but a wicked man lies down below. For this the devil can well yield to and suffer, that Christ passeth over the tongue, and meanwhile lieth under it, that the ears of the people are tickled, and they are infected with that which they love to hear. This gossip will not last long. For Satan wants to spread the gospel through the gospel. 


Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 47-51. 


1041 


since in presumptuous and secure minds there is no knowledge of sin, nor matter or tinder that [the heart of the gospel] 1) might be able. Christ has no workshop in which to work, for he alone came for the sake of those who are of a troubled and broken heart and spirit. As he himself says Matth. 11, 5: "The poor have the gospel preached to them." And in the prophet Isaiah God speaks Cap. 66, 2.: "| look upon the wretched and the broken in spirit, and who fears my word." But these despisers of the law are the most hopeful spirits, just as in the papacy the people under the traditions of the law were far from it and alien to it. Therefore, the preaching of the law is a preparation for the gospel, and gives Christ, who is the master of faith, matter in which he can work. 


For whom the preaching of the Law and the Gospel belongs. (Cordatus No. 1323. 1397.) 


The sermon of the law must be preached for the sake of the wicked, but mostly it falls on the good, who take care of it, and often too much. It is the same as when it rains on the sea and dense forests, not on fertile fields. 

God, who is merciful, does not belong to the peasants, but he who strikes with pestilence and war is right for them. 


(Here a paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 12, § 32.) 


The proud and presumptuous cannot teach Christ. 


Doctor Jakob Schenk acts the holy scripture, just as a schoolmaster Terentium walks the boy in school. So he looks at his person in the Scriptures, as ina comedy. He should be and wants to be. Therefore, it is impossible for a proud, arrogant, and arrogant man to preach Christ: he only wants to have broken, sorrowful hearts and lowly, humble spirits. 


1) In the editions: "that it could be capable." In Bindseil II, 68 this sentence is missing.

52. gushers are proud fools. ‘(Lauterbach, 7 Oct. 1538, p. 143 f.) 


After that, J[akob] S[chenk] was remembered, who proudly and mendaciously undertook everything and yet denied, and wherever he was, caused dissension by relying on the reputation of the prince and the applause of the people. But he will be disgraced in his time, as Joh. A(gricola) was in great prestige at court and almost the most trusted - councillor, but without me his prestige has fallen. When he preached at the synod in Zeitz, he displeased everyone. This wretched man, puffed up by his court, has deceived himself with new words. He insists that the revelation of wrath should be preached, not the law, since the revelation of wrath and the law are the same and synonymous. | would not ask anything about the revelation of the wrath if the law had been abolished. | would not ask anything about the revelation of wrath if the law had been abolished.

In theology arrogance finds no place, because it wants to have people who are spiritually poor, who should call upon God, and whom God wants to save, and he adds: You shall praise me, not yourself. Likewise: The heavens tell the glory of God (Ps. 50, 15. 19, 2.), not our glory, as those hopeful wretches do. It is a pity that we wretched people still want to seek honor in such great misfortune. We have to toil and gnaw with the devil, 


Those wretched, inexperienced people boast presumptuously of their victory. Just like that were Munzer, Carlstadt, Zwingli, Oecolampad, Stiefel, Eisleben, all of whom fell through hope. God preserve me, for |am a sinful man. | can also fall. 1)

(The first paragraph in Lauterbach, Oct. 10, 1538, p. 145; 

the second par. Oct. 11, p. 146.) 

When there was a lot of talk about J. S[chenk] that day, he answered: | don't want to accuse him for the sake of teaching, but have quite good hope from him. But | cannot avoid suspicion, because | am burned. [Be-]may well sensation, one praise him as one will. In a fine way Sulla said about Julius Caesar, who was praised by all: You shall be right, only hold fast to it, but this you should know, in Caesar there are many [people like] Marius. Thus Peter, the bishop of Alexandria, said of his presbyter Arius that he would take away Christ's glory. When Peter died, Alexander followed, who also resisted him [Arius]. Athanasius, his college, also resisted him. All of them he despised, and fell into the worst heresy. 

| praise open-hearted people, who state a matter with words and facial expressions and are not lying and hypocritical, like Joh. A[gricola] and J. S[chenk], who do everything amicably and yet lyingly. The name and designation "hypocrite" is very sharp and emphatic as well as Christ used [the word like this]. One cannot rebuke one higher than a hypocrite, a hypocrite, for he is the greatest plague. 


54. a different. 


Anno 1539, den 16. Januarii, arrived Doct. Martino letters from M. Gabriel Didymus, 2) in which he complained about D. J. Schenk, 3) the antinomian,

and supplicated to [the] Elector on account of his impure doctrine; for he clearly taught: One should abstain from gross sins and avoid the same. With which words hypocrisy would be defended. Then said D. Martinus said: The fool cannot hide himself, for it is an art above all art who can hide his art. The miserable, glorious, ambitious people seek only the favor of the common man even in the slightest word. 


55. of M. Eisleben's propositions. 


Anno 1539, the last of January, in the evening, D. Martinus of Eisleben read Propositions of the next disputation, which were quite unrhymed by Jonatha, Saul. 1) Finally, he noticed the deception of Eisleben's law, which played with allegories and _ secret interpretations, and thus revealed what he had in mind and meant. From such suspicion all propositions flowed and hung on each other. But one must, and shall, understand it thus: Jonathas is M. Eisleben, who eats honey and preaches the gospel; Lutherus, however, is Saul, who hinders the use of honey in the church 2c., but does not get back to the right goal. And said at last: Ah Eisleben, are you such a one? O, forgive you, God, that you are so bitter and consider me your enemy. God be witness that | have loved you and still love you. If only you would fight against me in public and not fight so viciously behind the Péckler 2). The next day was the disputation, and Eisleben was publicly disgraced. 


The antinomian doctrine is a very harmful doctrine. 


M. Hains 3) was remembered, who was an antinomian with the margrave. He did not want to punish, and made use of allegories. 


1) We have omitted with Stangwald here the following words, which are found in Aurifaber and the other editions "The most noble final cause that Cyrsilo rightly happened, that he would be killed; Eneas would still be excused."

and spiritual interpretations, which teaching is uncertain, but pleasant and airy to the people. There spoke D. Martinus said: Dear God, how the poison throws and eats around. M. Ham, Jeckel, Schenk are gone; so one would like to call M. Eisleben cheaply a colorful newt, 4) and a Kanker, who has many stars. It is a shameful and harmful doctrine that denies Christ by confessing him, and defiles and disturbs his kingdom by teaching Christ: it makes people presumptuous and despisers of God's grace, even though they boast of grace. 

P[hilipp] Melanchthon] wrote from Frankfurt, how he had to argue with the antinomians, and they defended their thing highly, and many people were attached to them. Then said D. Martinus said: "The devil is quite nonsensical, rages and rages. He will cause much misfortune through the antinomians, because many unrighteous things and evil things will come out of it and will take place if the law is brought out of the church to the town hall. After that the authorities will say: We are Christians too, the law does not concern us. Likewise, the executioner, as a Christian, will also throw away the law. Then, sweet mercy, that is, great and infinite courage and evil will follow, which cannot be controlled. So Munzer also concluded and concluded in 1525, with his and other people's following and adhering to him, great harm, made a lot of bad consciences, killed the poor people body and soul. 


The antinomian doctrine of different repentance. 


Anno 1539, April 15, D. Martino sent Positiones, printed in Leipzig, which, it was said, Johann Hanerus 5) had made, in which he disputes quite sharply how the law does not concern the Christians, and divided the repentance into three parts, saying: The Jews have another repentance, another the Gentiles, and another, the Christians. Then said D. Martinus said: Who would have thought that such unruly spirits should come? For this is a wicked and injurious thing. 


4) Cf. § 60 of this Cap. 5) Haner. Cf. De Wette IV, 545. 


1046 


It is a gross error to distinguish repentance according to persons, when all men repent in the same way, because all men, one and another, have offended and angered one God at the same time, whether they are Jews, Gentiles, or Christians. Therefore, it is a gross, abominable public error to distinguish repentance according to persons, as if men had a different repentance and faith before God than women; princes a different one than subjects; lords a different one than servants; the rich a different one than the poor. Thus, they make a person's reputation with God. 


58. a different. 


Haner, the wretched man, _ distinguishes repentance unjustly, and against God and his word; says: We Christians have a different repentance than the Jews and Gentiles: as if the prophets had not taught repentance rightly, and their repentance at Nineveh had not been righteous. Therefore, since repentance from the law should not be preached, it would follow that Christ had not been under the law, since he was under the curse of the law for our sake. 

Summa, Satan cannot rest nor celebrate, there come many heresies, which all at once dispute Christ as a God who became man. For all the heresies that have arisen have arisen either against the Lord Christ's divinity or humanity, 1) either denying His efficacy and power, or some circumstances. Thus the antinomians deny Christ, who was under the law, when they dispute the law, and think that it is no more sin than to crucify Christ; as if it were not a sin against the first commandment to crucify Christ again. 

We may well pray and watch, there are still many heresies to come. | do not say that repentance should not be preached to those who have already been justified by faith; but | do say this, and | urge that unrepentant, obstinate sinners should be taken seriously. 


1) Cf. Cap. 7, § 27.

1047 


2) and bring them to the knowledge of sins through the law; for where sin is not recognized nor confessed, and where one does not want to have sinned, Christ and the gospel can have no place, for where there is no sin or does not want to be sin, there is also no forgiveness. But the antinomians want to bring Christ into the midst of impenitent sinners, who have no conscience, nor know themselves how depraved and evil their nature is; there, truly, Christ has no place or room. 


59. false brothers, the sweet-mouthed teachers, are more harmful than the public ones. Enemies and papists. 


Our enemies, the papists, will not harm us, but the greatest danger is from false brothers. Who would have taken care of the antinomians? who protect and help themselves from my books, as if it were only a few sins that the Holy Spirit punishes. But if one were to ask the antinomians, "Is the offense against the Son only a few sins?" they would say, "For which Christ died, that is, for our sins against the ten commandments of God. Oh, | am quite hostile to the antinomians; God grant that they may recognize themselves. 


60. a different one from M. Eisleben. 


When it was said that C[aspar] Asquila, 3) pastor of S[aalfeld], and M. Ham in the Mark were antinomians, D. Martinus sighed deeply and said: Dear God, how the poison is thrown around! M. Eisleben should be called Stellio, a colorful newt, 4) because with his poisonous teaching the gospel is darkened. They, the antinomians, vex and mock the Lord Christ on the right, as the papists do on the left. For in teaching Christ, they impugn Him and take away His power and work. So J. Schenk simulates and holds behind the mountain for a while, and the boy Schwenkfeld, who causes much error, sows and seduces many people with his sweet words. There are still many thoughts

With this, Satan shows how hostile he is to the Word. 

But he made several degrees or stages of Christianity. The first one he called the decoction, that one should put away the gross sins, such as eating, drinking, fornication. The other is study, that one should think about another being and make an effort to improve. The third is wonder, speculation, and thoughts of sin and grace. The fourth is boredom, so he called the terror of the law, that one becomes hostile to it and suffers from sin. The fifth and last stage he called suspensionem gratiae, deep serenity, or deep unbelief and utter despair, as was in Judah. Serenity, the faith in God, that one should leave it to our Lord God. In this degree would be those who have heard God's word. 

This doctrine has a reputation of holiness, and in this way he diminished the authority and glory of the oral word, praised revelation and secret speaking, admonished and punished the Lost Gentiles, that is, those who would not praise nor accept his doctrine; and proved it with examples of the Old Testament. Until he brought together a great and mighty company of peasants and poor people without understanding, with whom he was going to attack and destroy the princes. So he brought in six thousand people miserably for body, honor and property, who were slain. 

He wrote from me: | also want to get him, his sharp tongues shall not help him. Once he wrote to me and M. Philippo: "I like it that you attack the pope in Wittenberg, but | do not like your whore marriage at all. He teaches about marriage that a man should not sleep with his wife unless he is sure beforehand, through divine revelation and inspiration, that he will beget a holy son or daughter with her; those who do not do so break the marriage with their wives.

tirerian preachers thunder and flash against the evangelicals, they held it with Philip and Luther, the others did not know what they blamed in their teaching. So, because they do not want to be our friends in God's name, they are friends in the name of the devil, as Judas was Christ's friend in the garden. 


74 Bucer's Argument from the Sacrament, Anno 1531. (Contained in Cap. 19, Z23.) 


Abuse of the sacraments is punished by God. 

(The first two paragraphs Cordatus No. 737. 738.) 

The enthusiasts, when they handled the dead stones and wooden images, won, but when the living came upon them, namely the Swiss, they were all slain, as it also happened to the coiner. 

If one needs the sacraments differently than God has appointed, it does not go out well, as Gideon did when he set up the ephod. He did not feel well about it either. 

Zwingel twitched the sword, therefore he received his reward, according to the saying: "He who takes the sword perishes by the sword", Matth. 26, 52; if God made him blessed, 1) then he did it extra regulam, outside the rule of His word, and dispensed with it. And D. Martinus continued: "Zwingel and Oecolampadius are like Phaeton and Jcarus among the poets, they want to master the Scriptures and interpret them as they please. 


The Sacramentarian Delusion of the Night Supper, and D. M. Luther's Concerns. M. Luther's Concerns. 

The sacramentarians are under the delusion that Christ's body is true in bread, and his blood is true in wine, but Christ's body and blood are neither eaten nor drunk by the ungodly nor the godly, but only spiritually. 

And that this is the delusion of the enthusiasts about the Sacrament of the Altar, was shown to all of us church servants in Wittenberg, especially in our presence, by M. Luther, our dear father, who diligently warned us aboutit, and said this as a testimony to his opinion and doctrine 


1) Cf. Cap. 9, § 19.

In this matter, namely, he could not, nor would not, admit, approve, or consent to this doctrine of theirs, because it is, he said, contrary to the clear public words of Christ, in which he commands us to eat his body; for Judas also, the betrayer, hath likewise taken the body of Christ, as well as the other godly, pious apostles. For one thing. Secondly, that this doctrine of theirs is not certain, therefore it cannot make consciences certain, nor assure that it is right. And for these two reasons he decided that he would much rather, and it would also be better, that this discord among us and the sacramentalists remain, than that one should compare and agree on certain proposed conditions and means. This was written to me, Johanni Schlaginhaufey, Johann’ Forster of Wittenberg on December 19, 1534. 


77 From Sadoleto, the Cardinal. 


Anno 1539, April 1, Sadoleti's letters were brought to Sturmium, in which he pretended to Phil. Melanchthon and Bucer, and praised them highly. When M. Luther had read them, he said: "How can the

0) The most serious damage to the gospel is done by the fanatics and the mobs. 


Just as no sword, power or authority could verthrow or force the pope, the lord of the world, xcept the one man, Martin Luther; so no tyranny will e able to prevent D. Luthern no tyranny can hinder, ut Satan by his cunning treacherous groups and ects, as in Apocalypsi stands that the lion has done o harm, but the dragon. For since Satan cannot do nything by force, nor is he able to, he dares to ccomplish everything by trickery and deceit, and to arken and falsify the gospel where he cannot even ampen it; he secretly sows tares among us. herefore, do not let the spirits of the mob take hold of ou or anger you, for this has always been the image nd fortune of the gospel; it tends to go that way. Only tay with it, God will preserve it and defend it from the evil and his scales. 


The first is the first of the two. At the Imperial Diet in Regensburg in 1532, Paul

cherry tree a cherry should grow; or how our mouth and our flesh are created. The world is full of miracles and wonders that happen every day. But, as Augustine says about the sixth chapter of John: Haec omnia propter multitudinem viluerunt. The Lord Christ once fed many thousands of people with a few loaves, but how many thousands of people does he feed daily? Omne rarum charum, vilescit quotidianum. He makes wine grow daily from the rocks, he can make butter and bread from the sand, but who respects it? 

So he created man once from the earth, and still daily he forms a man from a drop of blood. There is not a big difference. There in paradise he takes a lump of earth in his hand and says: "Make a man out of it"; then it happens. Nowadays he takes a drop of blood and creates a man out of it. These are great miracles, but because they happen daily, they are not regarded at all, and who can understand anything about them in the beginning? It is true that when reason is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, it can understand the Ten Commandments to some extent, and it can be guided by the Jewish religion; but to fully understand the articles of faith, as of the Holy Trinity; item, of the humanity of Christ, is far from being possible, because it does not rhyme. | cannot say that the King of France and this stone are one person; or that this knife and | are one person, for it does not rhyme.

But there he comes out when he says Col. 2, 3: In Christo sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae Dei; for in Christo all things are known, yea, all creatures, and the whole Godhead: in Christo is found the supreme strength and weakness, death and life, righteousness and sin, grace and wrath of God. Ah, it is a high article, and few take it seriously. 


operato. 


In 1542, M. Mathesius and the other table companions read over Luther's table the booklet de variis ritibus et ceremoniis Judaeorum by the baptized Jew Antonii Margarita. Then M. Luther said: "All religions, which are against the right, Christian, true religion, all come here ex opere operato, that one says: | will do this, it will please God. But this rule should be well noted, quod omne opus operatum est idololatria. So, what the papists only taught, that was all opus operatum. Their rules and traditions remind me of the Jews, as they have taken much from the Jews. The pope also wanted one to do this or that, as to put on a cap, wear a hard shirt and rope around oneself, and have it put on one's head: whoever did not do or keep this was condemned. Again, if one did it, they could not say for sure whether one would be saved by it or not. Fie on you, devil, what kind of teaching is this! If you do not do it, it will bring you damnation: again, if you do it, you will not know whether it is pleasing to God or not. In such. We poor people are stuck in such error. 

Then one of the table companions said: If the world should still stand fifty years, then still much thing would agitate. Then the doctor answered and said: "God does not want the world to stand so long, for it would become worse than it has ever been. For many sects would arise, which are now still hidden in the hearts of men, so that one would not know where one was. 1) Therefore come, O Lord, come, and smite with the latter day; for there is no more improvement to be expected. 


How all heretics could be fed. 


Do away with the ten commandments of God, said D. Martinus, and all heresies will cease. For the Ten Commandments are a fountain from which all heresy springs and flows. For the Holy Scripture is a book of all heretics. 


1) So Stangwald instead of "would be".

and ponder the reason why he wants it that way. He wants us to give ourselves the shame, but him the honor only; that we are poor fools and sinners, but he is wise and righteous, and considers those righteous who believe in his Son, as St. Paul says Rom. 3, 24. But we seek our honor and glory, and his shame. 

Therefore, whoever wants to be advised and helped, should diligently pay attention to the oral word, believe it, and turn the quare into an ita, and become like a child; as the holy scripture speaks of the oral word in a very fine and masterly way. If we had no more than the two Psalms, the 119th and 131st, which teach us that we should diligently pay attention to the word, we should be content with that, if the devilish quare (why? how?) had not taken us thus through original sin. 

But that some pretend and say that the oral word does nothing, but the Spirit does it, is necessary; for the apostles did not believe either, therefore God had to send them the Holy Spirit 2c. Answer: The apostles did believe, however weakly; but afterwards such weak faith became strong through the sending of the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit taught nothing else than what Christ had taught before, since Christ says in clear words, Joh. 16, 13: "He (the Holy Spirit) will not speak of Himself, but what He will hear, that He will speak" 2c. Summa Summarum, the devil does not want us to stay on the right path, but always drives us to one side. Epicurism goes to the left side, enthusiasm to the right, on which the most pious and devout walk in great superstition and idolatry. 


The first is the first of the two. 


In 1538, September 13, a fierce disputation against the antinomians and lawbreakers was held for almost five hours, in which D. Martinus opposed the new teachers in the strongest possible way and persuaded them to reject the law through the gospel and to abolish the law, and 


He said that he would resist them to the end, even if he should die over them. It shall also be said of him after his death. 

And on the evening over the table he said: He would never have agreed to Jeckel's and Grickel's opinion, he would never have put up with them, not even in the least. For the fire always used to be lit by a tiny spark. As the sacramentarians said in the first: It would only be bread; then, it would only mean the body; finally, it would be the true body, but only spiritual, 

So Arius also continued his heresy one by one, unhurriedly, of which Peter, bishop of Alexandria, when he noticed it, said long before that it was strange and against the honor of Christ; for whoever denies the divinity of Christ, takes away his honor. And he, Arius, began thus: First, he denied that Christ was God, and said, He was a creature, but fully adequate. But since the Catholic and pious bishops resisted him, he said to the other: Christ was the most perfect creature, even above the angels, through whom all things were made. Thirdly, he pretended: He would be only by the name of God. Fourthly, he said that he was true God from true God, light from light, led Christ into the school, and thus taught from him that the error was so subtle that many fell to him, and kept it with him. Also, the fine bishop of Milan, Auxentius, was deceived by the same error, against which Hilarius wrote an epistle. 

But since the pious Christian bishops were not satisfied, he said to the fifth: Christ was not born of the Father, like God, but made of one essence with the Father; he would not admit that he was not made. Then the quarrel arose over the Homousion. Hilarius opposed this, which book he wrote against him is the sum and content, that Christ is natural God, of the same essence with the Father. Although afterwards St. Jerome opposed it, he would have liked to see that this word, Homousion, was taken from the Symbolo Athanasii and Confession of Faith. 


1064 


because it was not written anywhere in the Bible and the Holy Scriptures. Which Athanasius. Athanasius put a stop to it and said: That one also spoke of the father, he was unborn, could not be born. Even though it was not written in the Scriptures, it rhymed well and would be spoken of in the same way. 

Summa, what shall | say: There is no error, superstition or idolatry so gross that one does not fall for it and does not accept it; just as now the Pope of Rome is also honored as a god. And the pagans also had a god, which name was not to be denied: for the same conceived as many creators as there were years in the world. As the Greek word (aApaéic) brings with it in number. 


87 A different from Arii heresy. 


The Arii heresy lasted very long, over three hundred years, reached the time of Augustine and Gregory. Under the emperor Constantino it was in the highest bloom; under the emperor Domitiano it tyrannized; under Joviniano, Valentiniano and Gratiano it diminished a little; it endured seven emperors until the Goths came. Thus the Turk is still today an Arian, although he praises in his oaths the four Gospels; item, that God is a creator of heaven and earth, likewise the resurrection of the dead. But he praises his Mahomet as the highest prophet: he has Christ preached publicly in Constantinople, but that one should leave his Mahomet satisfied and not attack and rebuke him, who is a wonderful man. 


88. Of the future sects prophecy of D. M. Luther. 


In 1539, January 23, D. Martinus lamented and lamented the sects that would still come from false brothers. There will be so much writing, he said, that the least grammarian and philosopher will want to write special things, and we will fall back into the old errors. For the devil is a thousandfold artist, and can disguise and adorn an error in many ways. So, the Samosateni's and Arii's error is almost the same, only 


Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 86-90. 


1065 


that the latter confesses one person with the Father, but the latter confesses two persons, but nevertheless one named God, who has only the name. Thus the sacramentarians have also twisted and decorated this saying: "This is my body”. 


89. of heretics, the abelists. 


He, D. Martinus, also remembered the heretics at that time, who were called Abelists and had taken the name from Abel; they would have been the most distinguished teachers outwardly in the light that the sun shone. For first, they held that all who wished to be in their sect should be in wedlock and have wives. Second, that they should dwell with one another, yet abstain from conjugal works, and diligently increase the household with goods and food. Third, that they should choose children from others and from other people to be their heirs. Truly, this has been a strange heresy, and a frivolous one, which has accepted foreign people as heirs. Who would not like that? Thus, the marriage state and God's order are always challenged. 


90 All sects and sectarian groups are rebellious. 


It is certain, said D. Martinus said, that every heretic and spirit of the mob is also seditious: for after he has taught and spread lies, he seals it with murder. Just as the Lord Christ paints the devil with the two titles, who so sets up poor people that they only set the antecedent, under a good opinion and pretense of peace, as if they sought nothing else than the salvation and salvation of people's souls, peace and unity: after that the devil soon infer such a consequentiam, and leads such a consequence on it, as the heretics themselves never meant nor thought. So Grickel does not now see this consequence that will follow; but the devil is a good dialectician, who has already made the syllogism, antecedens and consequens, the final soeech and consequence: but we are sure, think that the devil sleeps, walks idly, and does not rule, since he is among the children of God, and walks around, as Job complains Cap. 1, 6, and St. Peter says 1 Ep. 5, 8. 


1066 


Cap. 37. of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 91-93. 


1067 





The heretics and rotten errors have a great appearance. 


The heretics and the red spirits, the Jews and the enthusiasts, the doers and the nobles, are always more hopeful, more heated and have a greater appearance and reputation than the true Christians, for which reason one does not think otherwise, that they are righteous and that their thing is vain sanctity. But one can and must meet them with this one argument and reason, and ask them: Dear, is this also the command of our Lord God? Then they must fall silent. 


92. heretics unk Rotten want to be innocent martyrs on top of that. 


Doctor Martinus remembered the Grickel and said: "He is a proud, presumptuous man whom you cannot win over with whistling or crying, do what you will. The other day | was in Will, already on my way to talk and reconcile with Jeckeln and Grickeln, and yet | was about to be prevented from doing so and was advised otherwise: for | see that the kinder and friendlier | show myself to them, the more their stomachs swell, and they become more and more proud and defiant. He boasts that he is Abel, that he must suffer much and be strangled. What? He will become a martyr under my hands, and | must be his executioner to make him a martyr, since he has troubled and tortured me much more than all my adversaries. No pope or fanatic has grieved me more than he, and now he wants to lay the blame on me. Arius did the same when he wrote to his own: | am persecuted by my pastor and bishop for the truth's sake, but | overcome it all 2c. | mean, he was a martyr. In the same way, Christ also made the devil a martyr. Oh dear God, how we walk safely in such great wickedness, without all fear of God and prayer! Therefore, also very horrible and evil lines will follow. 

It was the same in the time of the apostles, after whom Manichaeus, the heretic, soon came and said: The apostles had the Holy Spirit, but inadequately, but he had it fully. So now our red spirits also say: we have well 


and be fine and right, but they would be perfect, they would have to work it out completely and bring it right 2c. So the devil's process goes, he does not do otherwise, that must be expected of him: he always wants to be our Lord God's master, and make everything better. 

So for these twenty years | have had more than fifty heretics who wanted to teach me, but God protected me from them, saying, "I will show you what you must suffer for my name's sake," Acts 9:16. 9, 16. Summa, "they must be heresies," 1 Cor. 11, 19; one cannot help it, do what one will. It was so in the time of the apostles; we will not do better than our fathers. When tyranny and persecution cease, heresies follow. For this reason | have let my confession and the three symbols of our Christian faith go out publicly, primarily for this reason, because these articles will soon come into danger and be challenged. The times under the Gospel are evil; where the doctrine is taught and preached purely, all things are revived. Now that this bright light of the gospel has gone out, we see what the world is, which we did not see before in the darkness: and though it hurts now, and we would gladly lament, Christ has laid down for us the loquebar, speaking, strong, as he says: "| am your Lord and Master, you are my disciples and pupils; if they have called me Beelzebub, how much more will they do it to you", Matth. 10, 24. 25. 10, 24. 25. You shall not have it better than I. 


93 From rebaptizers. (Cordatus No. 836. 837.) 

The Anabaptists are very bad boys who always boast of their great patience and always shed blood. That is why they cry out that the princes are godless and must be exterminated. They are living devils, not human beings. Carlstadt belonged to their sect and let his son die without baptism. 

Baptism is a bath of life, not just water. It is better that those who think it is only a sign remain without it. 


1068 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 94-98. 1069 


94. a different. (Cordatus No. 1695.) 


| do not know the faith of an adult, for he can lie; furthermore, the testimony of a man is not believed. Pay attention to God's word, which commands, and pay attention to God, who says: Preach, baptize, absolve. The prosperity is to be brought home to me. The Anabaptists say, If you believe 2c. Only the commandment and the word of God are to be regarded. 


The devil does not like the tanfe. 


Luther said that baptism is such a thing that all devils must not swallow a drop of it, otherwise it would become a cellar throat for them, which would burn them like hellish fire; but where they see baptism, they must not go to it nor stay with it, but must flee far away from it. Why is that? Because God has commanded and commanded that we should put our hand and tongue to it, and pour the water over the person to be baptized, with the words and letters that God has promised and assured us in the most certain way that He Himself will be present with His divine grace and power, and will do such a work Himself: Baptism is not mere letters, or merely bad water, but God has joined Himself to us and through us, as His instruments, to exercise His grace, power and might. 


96. mock remedy of the Anabaptists. (Contained in Cap. 17, § 10.) 


That one should read and contemplate God's Word diligently, for one cannot unlearn it. 


Doctor M. Luther said that Duke Frederick of Saxony, Elector, was in the habit of saying: "What one otherwise runs from worldly things or wisdom, | still want to understand well, but when God speaks, that is too high, that one does not grasp and fathom so soon. Yes, of course, said D. M. Luther; still 


we go there and think: O we read it ten years ago, and we know it well; but listen: 


Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit. This is said of a poet, for example, as of Virgilio or Ovidio; and if one runs it over ten years, then he finds something in it, quod delectet. But here they all cry out: O you can do nothing, because Fides, Fides, bona opera etc.. Well, they say: Repete, repete, acue, acue. So Moses cries out: Just read, just read, there you will probably find more, you will always find something that you never knew before. But we do not. | don't do it myself, that's why I'm sorry for myself, ego odi me; but when | come across it and read it, then | find strength, then | feel that it is a strength, and that it is not a history. The Sapientia says: Come and eat my bread, and you will not hunger; drink my wine, and you will not thirst; drink and be filled. Prov. Sal. 9, 5. 

Thus it is said: Letters of princes should be read two or three times, for they are written thoughtfully and wisely. Much more, one should read the Bible often, for God has written His wisdom in it. 


The teaching of the Gospel is like the sun and the moon. 


The teaching of the gospel is like the sun and the moon in the sky. For as the moon lightens the night, so the gospel also lightens the night, that is, our reason and human wisdom and understanding. Plato and Aristotle know well from the light of nature: Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris, but it is still dark and night to them. When the gospel comes, it wipes men's eyes so that they have to say, "Yes, indeed, it is true. Then the gospel is also a sun, because it brings the promise of the Son of God, when it says: Believe in the Son, who was crucified for you, died, was buried, and rose from the dead. This is the luminare magnum. That is why a Cardinal of Rome rightly said: "Even if the Gospel were not true (as they are wont to say), there is still no silent faith in the Son of God.

rer doctrine will never come on earth. And itis true that no teaching is more difficult than this, as you can see in Matth. 5:20 ff. 


99. enthusiasts always find followers. (The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Jan. 13, 1538, p. 8. - Das Folgmde, July 12, 1538, p. 98.) 

On January 13, Phil. Melanchthon a note written by an Anabaptist who had seduced G. K[arg]. This note had been given to Philip by the imprisoned G. K. had handed it over to Philip; in it the Anabaptist praised his spirit and where he had gotten it from; how he had been with Sebastian Frank, whose wife he praised with the highest and heavenly praises, because of her figure, because of her eloquence and her spirit, and he had agreed with her in such a way that his spirit and her spirit had joined together as high as [if] they were both one person; how he had stayed with the highest delight for seventeen weeks, at last he had departed from her, like Elijah from Elisha. This was written. Luther said: This was a whimsical deception of Satan and the most impudent lies by which he attacked the truth, and yet he had disciples who imitated him. The rude devil shall get disciples here, since we are still alive. | cannot hold Mr. D. S[chenk] unsuspicious that he has sent such a deceiver here. But in the end we will see how it stands [cujus toni]. 

On July 12, he commemorated the Anabaptist Hans Sturm, 1) who had been visited, interrogated and instructed here in the castle several times and still did not want to repent. When | asked him in the presence of many whether he also believed that Christ was a savior of children? If he believed that Christ died for them, and if he believed that he died for the children, that they also had sin, for which Christ had done enough by his death, he answered, "It is true that Christ died, but for us as an example, that we als should die. And thus he completely denied the powe

100 Whether the Anabaptists will also be blessed. (Contained in Cap. 9, § 19.) 


01. gushers want to be able to do everything and learn from no one. (Lauterbach, Aug. 14, Wednesday, p. 112.) 


On August 14, there was a respectable matron rom Freiberg, the wife of W(olf) L(ose), who in the resence of Luther deplored the audacity and ourtliness of J. S(chenk), and with what pride he had espised Wittenberg. Luther answered: "It is the art nd manner of the same spirits that they please hemselves alone, they despise the reputation of all thers; and told of the foolhardiness of some. Master orenz [Werder] of Torgau, the Anabaptist, and also a oldsmith were brought here; they went along in such reat impudence, wanted to be tested by us and aughed: What is the matter? Furthermore: What are ou examining us for, Magister Luther? | knew that efore you shat on a straw wipe. | am baptized and oly. | may no longer baptize children, for all my hildren are born holy of me. Such abominations atan begets in sure and presumptuous spirits. Therefore Solomon says Proverbs 28 (v. 14): "Blessed is he that feareth all things: but he that is stiff-necked shall fall into mischief." Let us take care and pray that 

we do not fall into temptation, and the visitations are very well ordered, so that such wicked men can be controlled.

1074 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 107-112. 1075 


Be enemies of Erasmus, for he is an abhorrer of religion. Just read his Dialogue de peregrinatione, and you will find that he wants to overthrow the whole religion from the ground up and completely reject the whole religion because of individual abominations, since the dialecticians say that no conclusion can be drawn from what is only individual to what is general. For it does not follow: A certain religion is godless, therefore every religion is godless. Therefore dialectics is also necessary, not the sophistical fallacies which he uses, as they [the sophists] once said: No one and no one bit each other in the sack; where they argued about whether "no one" was taken in itself [absolute], or accidentally, whether personally or really. 


108. erasmus is a launderer. 1) (Cordatus No. 1093.) 

Erasmus is not a Greek, but a little Greek, 2) who ridicules and imitates all others, and if he remained in his art, he would be a man, but since he wants to be wise in all things, he deceives himself. It is said: he shall be a fool before the world who wants to be wise before God. Erasmus does not want to do that. 


Erasmus is not a warrior. (Cordatus No. 1102.) 

Nature without art can do nothing, lies there like a log, and art without application can also do little. Therefore, use is the golden art, but art is the wooden art. The application has made me a teacher 2c. To mock Erasmus is not to refute, and if | were a papist, | would easily convict Erasmus; for although he mocked the ceremonies of the pope, he did not refute them. By mocking, we do not defeat anyone in our time. 


110. Erasmus is not Lutheran, but a papist Bloch and scoffer. (Cordatus No. 1226.) | want to free Erasmus from the suspicion that he is a luthe- 


1) Cf. Cap. 73, § 12. 2) Orusoulus Used by a scholar in a contemptuous sense: a conceited fool. 


He has the Roman faith and believes what Pope Clement believes. He is a papist, who believes what the pope wants, but ridicules everything about himself. In the dialogue, which he titled "Puerpera", his spirit and his faith come out. He says of God that if he were concerned about affairs, he would be foolish, powerless or unjust, because he does not govern everything on earth according to his will. But it is said [1 Cor. 1, 21.], "It pleased GOD well to make blessed by foolish preaching those who believe in it." 


111 Erasmus and Lucianus. (Cordatus No. 1294.) 


When | die, | will forbid my children not to read the Colloquia of Erasmus; for he speaks through other persons his exceedingly ungodly opinion, which is against the faith and the church. He may well ridicule me and others, but he will not ridicule the Scheflimini. Erasmus is much worse than Lucian, because he ridicules everything holy under the appearance of holiness. 


The Epicurean argument is like Caiphas' advice. (Cordatus No. 1304. 1305 and 1306.) 

| heartily hate Erasmus, because he uses the same argument against the gospel that Caiphas uses [John 11:50] against the person of Christ; for he thinks it better to be silent than that the princes of Germany should be aroused. John also hated Caiphas and Christ gives him a great blow [Joh. 19, 11.]: "He that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin." 

What a plain man 3) speaks should be noticed. Therefore John is to be read with special attention. Every word is worth a centner. He speaks as it were sleepy words like [Joh. 17, 5.]: "Father, glorify your son." But God and a godly person judges differently about these and other words of him. 

| have patiently borne that Erasmus mocked me, but since he also mocked Christ and

Even if many wise men in the world should be angry and turn away from me when | write against Erasmus, it is better that | lose them than Christ.

About Paul's letter to the Romans he says that the difficulty of the letter is greater than its usefulness. Does that mean Paul praised? Fie on you! 


114. by Erasmi Mona. (The first paragraph of this § at Cordatus No. 1330.) 


When Erasmus wrote his "Moria", he has begotten a daughter worthy of him. For it is fitting that that slippery-talking Vertumnus 1) should turn his tails in circles like this, and that a Thor should beget a Thorheit. (The following paragraph Cordatus No. 1338.) 


One leaf in Terence is better than all the dialogues and colloquies of Erasmus, my serpent, whom | hate. Epiphanias, Cyril, Bulgarius [Theophylact] have been the best in the Greek Church.

-§ 112-116. 1077 


| will faithfully oppose the reading of his books by all God-fearers, for they serve neither good discipline nor understanding. From one leaf in the Terentio, Erasmus can make a great long Dialogum or conversation. He is a mocker of religion, police and economy, of the church, secular and domestic regiment. And, since God is before, if our Confession and Apologia were dead, Erasmus would create an epicurean church. 


115 Erasmus sits between two chairs. 


Erasmus could well have served and been useful to the trade of the Gospel, as he is often Christianly admonished to do, but he has not done so. And now that he would like to, he cannot, for the matter has now come too far, and he no longer has the deck of cards in his hand, but has given it up. He has expressed himself in this way, so that he is no longer used by the papists for this purpose, and he is like Jude Iscariot, who also did not want to do it, since he was kindly admonished by Christ, when Christ said to him, "Why do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? Luc. 22, 48. "My friend, why have you come?" Matth. 26, 50. Then he could have refrained and served Christ, but he would not. After that, when he was sorry and wanted to, he could not, and was also despised and rejected by the Jews. Therefore a bishop said of Ario, the heretic, and said: Arius does not seek God's glory. So may | say of Erasmo also. 


116. erasmi way or ingenium. (Cordatus No. 1635.) 


Erasmus is such a mocker [Momus] that he cannot be seized either by us or by the papists, and on and on he devises new ambiguities which must be interpreted against him (even if the decree had not already made this determination). 3)

1078 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c 


If he were a Christian, he would not be playing his game with religion now as an old man. 


117 Erasmus does not respect Christ and his word. (Cordatus No. 1636.) 


| will speak plainly of Christ, and will say with Joshua [34:15], Call yourselves whom ye will serve; but | and my house will serve the Lord. How great a sin it is to mock Christ, as happened to him who said that Peter had said, "The devil is at war; what | strike, he heals;" this is clear from the suffering of the whole creature, which mourned when Christ was blasphemed on the cross. 


118. a different. 


After my death, said D. Martinus, now that he has spoken much of Erasmo, you shall say that Erasmus was a godless man and an epicure. But if | am alive, | will go after him. One should not suffer his treachery. He thinks he alone is wise and learned, mocks us as if we were vain geese and sleepy fools. In his writing he uses vain words of uncertainty, 1) which one can interpret as one likes, so that he will not be punished; as he now does in his new catechismo. Such dark, uncertain, and doubtful speeches do not serve piety, but do great harm and mislead the people. It behooves a teacher to teach, to nurture, and to defend with certainty. 

(Cordatus No. 1765.) 


| would have meant, | wanted to bring Erasmus with my epistle again in armor, that | would seize him as anot ambiguous [amphibologicum] in some words, but it is in vain. | would have hoped that | could cleanse the church of his doctrine and of his brood, that is Egranus, Crotus, Witzel, Oecolampad, Campanus 2c. | do not want him in the church.

119. by Erasmi Conterfei. 


When Doctor Martinus was shown Erasmi's conterfei, he did not like it. And it was said that when Erasmus saw his own Conterfei image, he said: Seeing thus, | am the greatest knave. So no one likes his own figure. 


120. from Erasmi Catechismo. 


Erasmus, said D. Martinus, has been poisoned and besmirched with Epicurismo in Rome and Venice: he has praised the Arians more than the Catholics: he may say: Christ is called God only once in John, since Thomas thus speaks to Christ: My Lord and my God, John 20, 28. But among all his enamored, 3) arrows | can least like his Catechismum, because he teaches nothing certain in it, makes young people only misguided and doubtful. 


121. of his life and end. 


(This § in Lauterbach, Aug. 16, 1538, p. 114, and. (the second paragraph) Sept. 30, 1538, p. 138.) 

Luther: Erasmus' sentence and position was: one must serve the time. He looked only at himself. He lived and died without a preacher and without comfort. He went in repentance correptam. 3) 

Erasmus of Rotterdam has written many things gloriously, for he had spirit, leisure, was without all complaint, without office, he did not preach, he did not read, he was not a steward, was in a state of life without God, lived very securely, as he also died [morixit], and in his agony did not desire a minister of the Word nor the Sacraments, and perhaps one still imputes to him the words that in his agony he is said to have confessed: Son of God, have mercy on me. God protect me that | should not desire a pious servant at my last end, yes. 


2). Thus at this point in Aurifaber. The otherwise more common spelling is: verlipt, e.g. Wittenb. VII, 148 b. It means: poisoned. 

3) in Teufels Rachen (Stuttg.-Leipz. Ausg.). This expression still occurs in Tischreden, Cap. 43, § 163, and in the admonition to the clergy at Augsburg. Wittenb., ed. VII, 447 b.; Jen. (3rd printing) V, 78 b.

If only | could call the next one, | would thank God. But that man learned that in Rome. But now one must be silent because of his reputation and his books. - Afterwards, there was again talk of collecting Luther's works in volumes; but he resisted: "I do not want my books, especially the earlier ones, to be published; indeed, | would rather destroy them all. For the whole church is filled with books, and the Bible is neglected. For many books of Augustine are nothing, the whole Jerome is almost nothing, with the exception of the Histories, which one would like to bring to four quaters 1). The world is vain, always desires new things, neglects the godly. A desire for libraries arises, and so my example gives others an opportunity. Everyone wants to write, because Luther has written.

Doctor Martinus pointed out to M. A. Lauterbach a very violent, bitter epistle that Erasmus had written to

D. Martinus answered: Erasmus has always attributed to him this divinity, which he wanted to deprive Christ of, has considered himself alone wise, has despised the others, and has considered us to be his fools and game birds, in whom he would have his pleasure, as if we did not understand his screwed and fickle words. | offered and challenged him in the epistle that displeased Philip, but he would not go along with me; for | had much from his great book, which he called Farraginem Epistolarum, that | wanted to cut out for him.

This, said D. Martinus, | leave after me in the will, and to this | take you to witnesses that | consider Erasmum the highest enemy of Christ, as none has not been in a thousand years. In his Catechismo there is not a word that he said: Do this or leave that. He

123: Prince Frederick's speech by Erasmo. 


Doctor Martinus said that Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony, had once addressed Erasmus at Cologne in 1519 and had given him a damask; after that he said to M. Spalatin: What kind of man is Erasmus? One does not know how to deal with him. And Duke George, as he used to say, "That the addiction stabs him, one does not know what he is up to: | still praise the Wittenbergers, who speak yes or no. It is also true, said D. M. M., because we tell it to the pope dryly. 

Then S. said: Erasmus once went out, let himself be heard of these blasphemous words: If God were not, | would rule the world by my cleverness. Dar-

If |am in good health and God gives me strength and power, | will confess my Lord Jesus Christ fully and freely against Him. | will not sell Jesus like this. | go to the pit every day, therefore | will confess him with a free open mouth, and not mince words. For he that speaketh sophistically, and keepeth gruel in his mouth, that is a good enemy to him, especially in matters where he is sensibly concerned. Just as the pagan Quintilianus says that one should beware of the one who speaks doubtfully, with uncertain and wavering words, which can be interpreted and twisted wherever one wants, in both rights. But now Erasmus speaks with diligence and deliberately, even maliciously, slippery and, as they say at court, with screwed words, which have no certain sense, and which he directs and ver-

can turn of his liking, according to his sense, as he wants, according to opportunity of the circumstances. 

Therefore | command you by God's command, said D. Martinus to those who were with him, that you be enemies to him and beware of his books, for he considers all our theology, like Democritus, the pagan mocking philosopher, that is, to be nothing but foolish heiding, you laugh and scoff. | will write against him, if he should die and perish: | will kill Satan with the pen. Although these thoughts have plagued me for a long time, | have refrained from writing against him, because | thought, "What if you kill him? Well then, | have killed Muenzer, whose death is on my neck. But | did it because he wanted to kill my Christ. Uncertain, doubtful, wavering words and speech are to be swept up, run through the reel, quickly chastised and not left well alone. With rhetoric | cannot be his equal, but with dialectica | want to be superior to him; if not beautiful and curly, as they say, then silly and firm. 


Erasmus does not respect God's word in theology. 


Erasmus, said D. Martinus, understands his thing, that is, pagan trades; but our thing, that is, theological things, he does not respect: brings together all philosophers, kings and princes, sayings, words and deeds: then he brings to heap and shows all the aversions that have come from our doctrine, that Christ, as an incomprehensible, inexperienced young man, punishes and rebukes them all at once, yes, condemns them. Finally, he concludes: "If there were a God, he would not suffer such things. That is why he has a god called Rhamnusia, 4) that is, luck: as it goes, so it goes, as it falls, so it falls, approximately; believes no other god. 

The first is that in all his books there is no mention of faith in Christ and how he conquered sin, death, the devil and hell. 


3) l.e. necessarily. 4) Rliarnnusia, i.e. nemesis, fate.

and which he has overcome. The other is that he deliberately desecrates and blasphemes our thing with special diligence, and uses such words and sayings that would not occur to a stick-fool; but he speaks and writes deliberately. But he opens his heart, and makes it manifest, because he defends his thing so highly, otherwise he would 1) press on the epicurum, as it is written Luc. 19, 22: "Thou servant of a fool, out of thy words | judge thee." 


Erasmus does not respect God's works and creatures. 


We, said D. Martinus, are now in the dawn of the life to come, for we are beginning to regain the 2) knowledge of the creatures that we lost through Adam's fall. Now we see the creatures quite rightly, more than in the papacy. Erasmus, however, asks nothing about it, cares little about how the fruit is formed, prepared, and made in the womb, so he also does not respect the marriage state, how glorious it is. But we, by the grace of God, begin to recognize His glorious works and wonders even from the little flowers, when we realize how almighty and kind God is; therefore we praise and extol Him, and thank Him. In his creatures we recognize the power of his word, how mighty it is. When he spoke, 3) there it stood. Also in a peach pit: the same, although its shell is very hard, yet it must open in its time, through the very soft pit that is inside. Erasmus ignores this and does not pay attention to it; he looks at the creatures as the cow looks at a new gate.

Erasmus does not think anything of God. (Cordatus No. 1518. 1519 and No. 51.) 


Erasmus is a jack in the skin, which is evident from all his books, especially in the Colloquiis, where he does not speak in his own person, but in others. He mocks the true religion next to the false one. If |hada year free, | would want to fight with him. To this Erasmus, the father and the son is a ridiculous thing. 

God has allowed us to play with "apples" and pears and nuts, our wives; but with Him and His majesty He does not let us joke. 

Philip Melanchthon: Erasmus of Rotterr dam said that after the theologians invented the Father and the Son, they also added the Holy Spirit so that they could argue about their offices.

In Erasmi's epistles you will find nothing more special than that he praises the friends and scolds and blasphemes the enemies and adversaries, and nothing else.

Paul has been the wisest man, according to Christ, who says [Tit. 3, 10.], "Avoid a heretical man, when he is admonished once and again." 

| am well pleased; he that deceiveth me, let him deceive me. The game is started in one name, which is called Christ. | dare now, ask nothing of it, where stocking 1) or tail remain.

139. of the Rottengeister theology. 


For when he looked around at all creatures, he saw in all of them something good and something bad, as in the trees some good fruit, some bad, in others worms, rotten twigs, and the like. Furthermore, that he fell into such a gross error was due to the fact that he either did not treat the first article of the Christian faith at all, or only very superficially; otherwise he would not have admitted a second God. The same happens to all those whom reason deceives. But it deceives those who either wholly or partially follow their thoughts and not only the word of God. 


141: Of errors and sects. (Except for the last paragraph, Lauterbach, 21 JkIn. 1538, p. 14.) 

Afterwards Schneidewein said that a big rumor was spread here and there about a preacher who was caught here, who had been seized during a disputation and thrown into prison. Some spread this rumor about M. Georg Rérer, some about Major. Luther answered and gave information about the matter and the person [Karg], that he was seduced by an Anabaptist, so that he denied that Christ had received his body from Mary. He claimed that Christ's body was a real body, not an illusory body, as the Manichaeans say, but a heavenly and divine one. When | countered him: If Christ has not taken on our flesh, then our flesh and blood cannot enjoy blessedness: he claimed, on the other hand, that our flesh would not be resurrected, but that a new flesh 


One of them said how the theology of the red-!would be created. Thus one error begets other errors, blooded spirits was the cause of much evil andland if we do not watch and pray, innumerable sects misfortune. Yes, said D. M. Luther, there is no greater will obscure the pure gospel. If the devil dares to defile mischief than the sun: for if it did not shine, there |the articles of faith in our time, when we are still alive, would not be thievery, adultery, robbery and drudgery. |what good can we hope for in our descendants?

140 Error is apparent and glistens. (Cordatus No. 87.) 

There is no error that does not have a very beautiful appearance when one breaks into God's word with reason. Thus, for Manichaeus, error had a very beautiful appearance of the two gods or principles, one of which was good, the other evil;

They strut in their gifts, but in the holy scripture everyone should humble himself 2) | hold Jakob S(chenk) suspicious that he has incited that student against us by his arrogance and hatred. For | hear that he has boasted that he wants to create all the theologians and philosophers of the university. It is just a lot to take a bite out of. 

The Anabaptists and Sacramentarians, said D. M. Luther. M. Luther, "have caused tumult and noise and disrupted the church, but have done no particular harm to Christianity. But |, if | were to take three bishoprics from the pope and deny Christ, would do great harm to Christendom. For the devil gives me other more pointed arguments, which they do not yet know and can pretend. But God protect me from that. And in this | realize that the devil is a master of the world. Nevertheless, | also realize that Christ is stronger: because Verbum Domini manet_ in aeternum, God's word remains eternally, and whoever clings to it with faith also remains eternally. 


The false teacher's nature and sin. 


All murderous and wolfish teachers’ kind, said D. M. Luther. M. Luther, is that they want to be praised as doing better than all other salutary teachers. Therefore, they also sin against the Holy Spirit in this way, so that their sin cannot be forgiven 2) but must fall into punishment, because they not only sin, but also justly defend such sin with all iniquity; for sin must be recognized and repented of if it is to be forgiven. 


143. false teaching does not hold the length. 


In 1532 a very poisonous book went out against the Holy Trinity. M. Luther: "People do not think that others have also written and acted on this article; but it does not hold the sting that | want to set my thoughts against God's Word and the Holy Spirit. 


1) From these words "for ... humble" is Cap. 22, z 57 made. - The same thought Cap. 37, § 34. 2) Cf. cap. 39, § 18 at the end. 


144, heretics cannot be persuaded of their delusion. 


In 1542, D. M. Luther said: "No heretic can be persuaded to turn away from his own delusion and mind and give honor to the truth of the divine word. No, they see and hear nothing. Like M. Stiefel, when he preached in 1533 that the last day should come in the same year: he neither saw nor heard me. Throughout my life, no adversary has given me such evil words as he did. And even if they repent, it is still generally a gallows repentance that does not have the time or the right root. 

Oh, it is soon done for a man that the devil takes him over so completely that he has neither sense nor reason. We do not believe that we are such weak people and that the devil is so powerful. | often wonder what kind of battle it must be between the devils and the angels. | think that the angels are often defeated for a while when they fight for us. It is said: You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, you shall not curse, rebuke 2c., much less commit heresy. | hold that Grickel believes nothing: he holds godliness to be a trade and business; and again. If it were without the prophets, and [we] had not them, we should despair: but their examples sustain us, because it was so with them, yea, with the Lord Christ himself. "The disciple is not above his master," Luc. 6, 40. 


145. lack of listeners and preachers. 


D. M. Luther said: "The only thing people lack is that they cannot take the preaching ministry for the word of our Lord God: they only think that it is the speech of the priests. Therefore they fear (as they say) that one wants to become papist again, or that one wants to get the upper hand over the laity again. So we pastors and preachers also fail to hold our teachings as God's word. For when people humble themselves before us, we soon want to tyrannize. 


3) D. i. duration. 


1090 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 145-148. 1091 


Now this is the plague that has always been from the beginning of the world, that the hearers are afraid of the tyranny of the teachers, and the preachers want to be gods over the hearers. It was the same with the prophets: If they put just a long time before: Haec dicit Dominus, it did not help until the punishments came afterwards. So then one complains: These are evil times. Yes, recordare, fili, says God, that you also did not want to hear me. This is what Solomon said in fine words, Proverbs 1:24, 25, 26: Extendi manus meas etc., nunc ego vos quoque ridebo. They are mala mundi, there is no other way, it will remain so. Lot must be in Sodom and Moses in Egypt, Jacob with Laban in Mesopotamia. Nothing else will come of it, therefore we may send ourselves to suffer cheerfully. 


The devil does not harm the gospel with persecution. 


D. M. Luther once said: "If the devil were so wise as to keep silent and allow the gospel to be preached without hindrance and persecution, he would have less damage to his kingdom; for if the gospel is not challenged and persecuted, it rusts away and has no cause to display its power and strength. 


Luther's complaint that it is evil in the German land and that God will punish it, as punishment has always followed the preaching of God's Word. 


O dear children, whoever can die, let him die soon, it does not want to become good in the world, it truly does not want to become good. If | knew that my children would see the misery that is coming, | would much rather die soon with my children and all believers in Christ. It will happen this way, and you can already see how John the Evangelist says: Christ will have ventilabrum in manu sua, and purgiren aream suam, he will winnow the grain on the threshing floor, Matth. 3, 12. When the Gospel was in Rome, our Lord God winnowed confidently, and many fine people came away. God gathers the grain into his barn. When 


When the people were gone, he set fire to Rome so that it lay in ashes and cannot yet be rebuilt. The same will happen to the German land. Our Lord God will collect his grain: when that is gone, he will set the German land on fire. For our sins oppress us, and we do not repent, but still heap God's wrath and punishments upon us. 

Recently, a great prince gave Erasmo Albero leave, only because he wrote to him that it was not right that the poor priests should give protection and tax from their pay, if they otherwise had no trade nor access, but their pay, from which they would have the nourishing bread to eat, and this pay they should still overspend. But he had to leave the country because of this, and the citizens, where he was, tied a pair of shoes to his door and wrote over them: Surge et ambula; so he had to go away in disgrace, as a rebel. Well then, let us begin a Domo Dei, so let it be lamented to God. 


148 Of the eclipses. 


It was once thought over Luther's table that the eclipses had neither effect nor effect; if one had said in former times that the eclipses or darkness always meant the death of a king or otherwise of a great leader. To this D. Luther answered and said: It is true, the eclipses want to have no more effect. I think that our Lord God will soon come with the right effect and strike with the last day; as I dreamed the other day: when I lay down to sleep after noon, I dreamed that the last day came on the day of Paul's conversion, and I said: In pace in id ipsum requiescam seu dormiam. 

And Luther said: "I know no more counsel, for it is as | dreamed that the last day had come. For it is impossible that the Pope's church or the Roman court should be reformed; the Turk and the Jews cannot be punished and reformed; there is also no improvement in the Roman empire; it cannot be punished and reformed. 


1092 Cap. 37: Of hawkmots and sects 2c. § 148. 149." 1093 


help. They have now come together for thirty years at many imperial congresses, and yet they have never achieved anything; the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. So our people are rising, and now they are also becoming incorrigible; so that this regiment cannot stand, no one can be drawn any more; therefore it cannot remain, or there would be no God. 


(This paragraph Cordatus No. 409.) 


There is no greater plague on earth than a wayward woman. Therefore Solomon says [Prov. 30:21-23] "A land is troubled by three things, and the fourth it cannot bear. A servant, when he becomes king; a fool, when he is too full; a hostile woman, when she becomes wicked; and a maid, when she becomes her wives' heir. When the louse is in the grind, no one can get along with her. The servant who becomes king is the nobles, the fool is the peasants. 

These four things are now going on with force in the pregnancy, therefore | know no other advice nor help, except that the last day will come; one can never help, it is desperate. Perhaps our Lord God lets his gospel go now, so that he wants to gather his Christians beforehand, as he has always done. When he wanted to destroy a kingdom, he first gave them preachers and had them call out: Here, here; come, come; learn rather. 

The sermon is always preceded by punishment. So he did also in Rome: when he had gathered his Christians therein, the Goths and Vandals came, and thrust them into a heap. He did the same in Jerusalem. As John the Baptist says in Matt. 3:12: "God hath a shovel in his hand, and gathereth his wheat into the barn, and the chaff he will burn with fire." How many a strong sermon will he have preached, which are only described in short words; he will have said: Dear people, look, your Savior is coming, | am his praecursor, he will surely come when | am dead. Yes, what does he mean by this? Little. | would like to hear such a sermon. What a sharp sermon that would have been, when St. John says: "You vipers", Matth. 3, 7. 


is much more severe than when | call the pope an antichrist. So all the sermons of the prophets are only short sentences and indications of their teachings: otherwise, if all the sermons of Jesus and other prophets had been collected together, it would have been a large book, probably sixteen times as many as the other prophets’ writings are now. 

But so it goes: our Lord God gathers his grain, the axe is laid to the tree, says St. John Matth. 3, 10. It will not be otherwise. Curavimus Babylonem et non est sanata, ideo relinquamus eam, say the angels, Jer. 51, 9. we will leave it and go away.' O it is a poor thing when the world is thus abandoned. 

Therefore | often think when | walk and speculate what | should pray for the Diet; for the Bishop of M[ainz], Albrecht C[ardinal], is not pious, the Pope is lost; so | know no other help than that | pray: Dear Father, adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua, and make it an end, veniat dies illa extrema. There is no hope of improvement. One can help the empire as little as | can help a ship that is out of my hands and floating in the middle of the Elbe; only that | pray that they do not make it worse, so that there may still be a little stay. 

lam not so much afraid of the emperor and the pope who persecute us as of our own sins and ingratitude. | did not want to look at the pope, he can do nothing, he has not done anything to us yet; but our ingratitudo, contemptus et fastidium verbi in tanta luce, will do it, so that the devil even creeps in to us. This sometimes causes us to be despondent, for this sin even pushes the bottom out of the barrel. 


149) That false teachers and heretics should be punished without knowledge of their sins, and without public knowledge of them. 

Revocation, not shall accept again. 


In 1540, Luther said: "If the pope would throw away his triple crown and leave his Roman chair, and let go of the primacy, and if the pope would give up his triple crown, and let go of his Roman chair, and let go of the primacy, and let go of his triple crown, and let go of his triple crown. 


1094 


publicly confess that he has erred and devastated the church, and shed innocent blood; yet we cannot receive him back as a member of the Christian church, but we must consider him to be the real Antichrist. 

When M. Eisleben had denounced the Antinomy in Wittenberg, and would have liked to have gotten along with M. Luther, and all kinds of conditions had been proposed; also M. Eisleben's wife wept bitterly, and begged very much to accept her husband again; item, the Elector of Brandenburg wrote for him, and interceded, M. Luther answered nothing to it, but this: If he is publicly recanted in this manner, he can be accepted as: | confess that | have deceived and wronged those of Wittenberg.

150. answer of D. M. Luther, given to a Kliigling. 

When M. Luthern once asked someone a question, and the doctor had answered him, and he did not want to be satisfied with that, he continued much more with various questions; then D. Luther said to him: Beware of the quare, si non vis errare. Strife makes strife. Hader significat panniculum, ex quo conficitur papyrus.

For a Christian, the essential [forma] of life is believing the Gospel, the purpose ffinis] is the forgiveness of sins, the active is the Holy Spirit, the accidental [accidens] is to be afraid in the world. 


2. the Christian service.

that they wear hard or woolen shirts, and cut themselves with rods 2c. God knows nothing of the service of God, nor does He desire or require it of us; but this is the right service of Christians: when His word is taught diligently, purely and unadulterated. There the hearts are properly instructed and taught, so that they know what and how they should believe, and are also taught how they should love God and their neighbor. 

Faith is the right worship that is most pleasing to God; however, it does not come from our will, strength, and effort, but from the Holy Spirit alone, who works it in the heart through the oral word when

and where he wants, if one listens diligently to the preaching of the divine word. "Therefore Christ also praises the faith of the Cananaean woman. He does not say that she is a bitch, but says, "It is not good to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs." And what follows shows that Christ was not serious when he spoke to her. Matth. 15, 26. 28. 


3. the holiness of Christians. (Cordatus No. 1209-1212.) 


Great is the narrow-mindedness of people, because of which they cannot receive the grace given to them by God. This is where blindness comes from, although we know that we have the Word, that we have been baptized. Although we have faith, we cannot be sure that we are holy. Likewise, that we rather allow ourselves to be called Christians, which is a much loftier thing than saints. We have been able to call clothes and dead things holy, but we do not dare to call Christians holy. We look at the condition and we believe that no one is holy if he does not perform miracles. This unbelief is strengthened by the pope, who declared only the dead to be saints. Zwingli also distances us from the [right] opinion of holiness, since he calls a righteous man and righteousness pious and godliness; hence it comes that we immediately look to good works. 

But we want to remain with righteousness, which is of the kind that is imputed to us, 2) and is nota condition, namely, that God considers us pious and righteous. We cannot consider ourselves so, because we judge according to our feelings. We do not judge according to faith, that is our weakness. 

Christians always do good because they are 


1) It should be noted that in Luther's time the expressions "pious" and "godliness" were used of a walk in so-called good works. That is why we have translated xius mostly as "godly". 

2) The words in justitia praedieainenti relationis 6t uou ouuUtatis would literally mean: "in the righteousness of the category of relation and not oer constitution", i.e. in the righteousness, dre is referred to us, but not inheres in us. (Wrampelmeyer.) 


They get up again when they have sinned, and with bruised hearts they praise God for the repentance and ask that He henceforth make them stronger and protect them from such a fall. From those who sin, the Holy Spirit certainly departs, but immediately they pray [Ps. 51:14], "Comfort me again with thy help, and the joyful Spirit reveal me." After Peter has denied, he weeps, Magdalene sheds tears 2c. 

The Christians whom Christ loses through sin, he seeks again and calls them back; we are only to believe. For faith is a very great thing, but it is learned only through practice, patience, challenge and perseverance [practical]. 


4. very difficult is to believe forgiveness of sins. 

Many boast that they have learned the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins, and can do it very well: and I, poor wretched man, can take so little comfort in the suffering and resurrection of Christ, and the forgiveness of sins. But this | can do, that | eat our Lord God's bread, and drink his wine and beer: but that | could accept the most necessary treasure, the forgiveness of sins, out of pure grace, that will not follow. 


5. miraculous dispute of Christ and his members with the devil and his scales. (Contained in Cap. 7, § 86.)

Christians have and should have to do and create with two things, namely with God's word and works. They should deal with this.

So Eck did not have peace in his heart, as also all miser, usurer 2c.

There is a great mountain that hinders us from seeing our blessedness; for if we rightly knew an understood the greatness and dignity of our baptism, we would be blessed even to feel it.

lam not afraid of those who attack the church from outside and of public enemies, such as the papists and tyrants with their violence and persecution. For by this the church is not corrupted, nor is God's word hindered, but rather it increases and is increased. As Tertullianus says: Sanguine Christianorum rigatur Ecclesia’ ): through Christian blood the church is watered, fertilized and improved. But the inner evil of the false brothers will do the right damage and devastate the church, so that there will be mercy. Judas had to betray Christ, and the false apostles had to confuse and falsify the gospel. These are the true companions through whom the devil rumbles and destroys the true church. 

Therefore, he comforted Mr. Gabriel, pastor, and Mr. Michael Schuttes, deacon at Torgau, for the sake of Jeckel, the antinomer, who was then Saxon court preacher at Torgau, that they should watch and pray. For the devil, he said, cannot be countered or resisted with human strength and weapons. For, as Job says Cap. 41, 18, he respects a long spear that is shaken and used for a thrust like a straw. But he is afraid of the sword of the spirit, that is, of God's word, which causes him burnt sorrow. Therefore, let us honor God's word, hold it dear, and pray. 


2. what a hypocrite is. 


Doctor Martin Luther asked how the little word hypocrita should actually be translated. 


1) Cf. cap. 20, z 12. 





(20) False brethren are the worst enemies of Christians, as Judas was among the apostles; that they should not be offended. 

The world does not recognize righteous Christians.

For "hypocrite," he said, would be too weak and too low. It means almost as muchasa__ villain, who for the sake of his 

The hypocrite is not only a hypocrite or flatterer who caresses and speaks what one likes to hear, but who also deceives and harms, and that among the people. Hypocrita is not only a hypocrite or flatterer who caresses you and speaks what you like to hear, but at the same time also deceives and does harm, and that under the appearance of holiness, as the examples Matth. 23, 23. ff. clearly indicate that Hypocrita is a harmful deceiver. For St. Jerome says: That pretended holiness is twofold wickedness. Therefore Hypocrisis is called false, Hypocrita a child of perdition, a false desperate knave. Lucas painter calls such a knave a holy rogue. Hypocrite is too thin and weak. 


3. with what people the Christians have to quarrel the most. 3) (Cordatus No. 266.) 


The greatest and most violent quarrel that Christians have is with false brothers, and it is by far the most violent because they want to be and be called Christians, which they are not. If they wanted to say that they were people like Pilate, Judas and Herod, that is, if they wanted to give up the name of Christians, we would suffer from them all the adversities that they would dare to inflict on us; the war would be over and peace would be restored to us. But because they still want to use the Christian name, we have to fight,

we arrogate to ourselves the rule over consciences by the word, and will not let it be taken from us. 


4 False brothers have come in the place of monks. (Cordatus No. 171.) 


After we have cut off monks and nuns 1) by the preaching of the word, now false brothers confuse everything, so that also in our listeners it will be true what is written: "He came into his own, and his own did not receive him. [John 1:11.] 


5. of Judah Iscarioth, the example and model of all false brothers. 


lam surprised, said D. Martinus, that nothing is written about Judah, what he did to Christ for mischievousness. | think he did it most with his tongue, because Christ does not complain about him without a cause in the 41st Psalm [v. 8, 10]. He will have gone to the chief priests and elders and spoken 


Judas, for what he serves and is useful as an apostle. 


Judas, said D. M., is as necessary among the apostles as otherwise three apostles; he solves and solves many innumerable "arguments" and loci, as, the main article of justification, against the heretics, the Donatists, who pretend that no one can baptize except he who has the Holy Spirit. Against this stands Judas, who is an apostle and one of the twelve; therefore what he did in his office was right; but if he stole and is a thief, he has done sin and wrong: therefore his person must be separated from the office; for Christ did not command him to steal, but to carry on the office of preaching, baptizing 2c. 

So also Judas solveth, which they reproach us with: Yea, say they, there are many bad fellows, false brethren, and unbelievers among you. Right, Judas has also been an apostle, he will undoubtedly have stood and held himself in a much better position than an intelligent man of the world, than the others, no one

bad guy, because if the man, Jesus Christ, is an enemy, there must be a great cause. He must have longed for Christ. Otherwise, if he had not been so wicked, our Lord God would have forgiven him, just as he did St. Peter, who also fell, but out of weakness; but Judas falls out of wickedness. 

But just as the Jews at Jerusalem could not be prevented from crucifying Christ, so neither can they be helped when the punishment of God is at hand. This we see in the case of the traitor Judah. Our Lord God has Judah and the other Jews finely attacked, and so they are very weak, 


1) shorn out, i.e. separated, eliminated. 


7. poor Judas, D. M. Luther. 


(This § is Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, Col. 1472 f. No. 40, the first verse). 


8. Judas, a picture of the enemies of Christ and his divine word. 


That Judas hanged himself, and his belly burst open, and his bowels fell out of him, is an example and a picture of how all those should perish who persecute Christ and kill his Christians. For as it happened to Judah, their commander and captain, because he betrayed Christ, 


1104 


Cap. 395 Of hypocrites and false brothers. § 8-10. 


1105 





So shall it be with the other enemies of Christ. And the Jews should look at their cousin Judah and see that they would all perish in the same way. 

There is also an allegory and mystery in the little words "belly" and "bowels". For the belly signifies the whole Jewish kingdom, which is to fall away and go to the ground, so that nothing of it remains. Item, that the entrails were poured out, so it was indicated that also the children of the Jews and their descendants, yes, the whole Jewish family, should perish and perish. 

It has also been said that where God's word goes, one only becomes more angry and stubborn, since one should reform and convert from it. There is a terrible example and spectacle of this in Judah: he preaches the gospel himself, and performs great miracles and wonders, and is also the chief among the apostles, and yet he betrays Christ and sacrifices him on the flesh bench, so that he is captured and crucified. Thus the Jewish people become neither more pious nor better: although they have heard the gospel from John the Baptist, from Christ, the Son of God Himself, and from all the apostles, yet they crucify Christ in the end, and beat all the apostles to death, and thus remain hardened in their sins until they are destroyed and annihilated by the Romans. It is a strange thing that the gospel, which should soften them and entice them to repentance, should only make them harder, worse and more wicked. But it is the same with the sun, which shines on mud or dung, which is soft and full of water, but the moisture dries up because of the sun's heat and warmth, and the dung becomes as hard as a stone or pebble. On the other hand, the sun also shines on wax, which is hard, so that it must be driven apart with axes and mallets, but when the wax feels the heat of the sun, it softens, melts, and fuses. Thus, some only become more angry and hardened from the preaching of the divine word, and to them the word is "a stench unto death," as St. Paul says in 2 Cor. 2:16, but Christian hearts are turned to God by it, and they are not ashamed. 


and the gospel is to them "a savor of eternal life, yea, a power of God that maketh them blessed," Rom. 1:16. Now, the Jews have not improved much from the gospel, nor have they become more devout through the manifold miracles and examples of the wrath of God, which He has presented to them for repentance. 

Thirdly, we learn from this example that the enemies of the Lord Christ and his word do not cease their tyranny until they are brought down to the ground; for no admonition, warning or miracle will help them, as can be seen in Sodom and Gomorrah, in Pharaoh who tormented the children of Israel, in the empire of Babylon, and in Jerusalem 2c. 


9, how Christians are preserved against the devil and tyrants. 


D. M. Luther once said: it reminds him of the pious Christians as a goose, which one ties on a wolf pit, where around vain hungry wolves stand, and they want to eat gladly; but the goose is kept alive, and the wolves, who jump after the goose, fall into the pit, are caught and slain. So also the dear angels protect us Christians, so that the devils, the ravening wolves, with the tyrants and persecutors do not have to destroy us. 


10. that the heretics and the fanciers are useful to the Christians. 


D. M. Luther said in 1542: "We do not know how good it is for us that we have adversaries, and that heretics revolt and oppose us. For if Cerinthus had not done so, John the Evangelist would never have written his Gospel; but since Cerinthus opposed the divinity of the Lord Christ, John had to write and say: In Principio erat Verbum, and made the distinction trium personarum so clear that it could not have been clearer. So, when | began to write against the indulgence and the pope, Doctor Eck lay against me, he made me lively and woke me up. | wanted to wish the same man from the bottom of my heart that he would be converted and that he would be like- 


1106 


| wanted to make a fist of him so that he would convert. But if he should ever remain so, then | wish him that he would become pope, for he would have well deserved it: for until now he has had to bear all the burden, toil and work of the papacy against me with disputes and letters alone; although they have also paid him in part, for he alone has seven hundred guilders from the parish of Ingolstadt income. But he would be cheap, because they have no one else who could do it and attack me. He gave me the first thoughts against the pope and brought me there, where | would otherwise never have been able to go. Therefore, if the heretics and others of our adversaries think they can do us great harm, they must serve us and be of use. 

And Doctor Martin Luther said at another time that St. Augustine said: "Heretics, they woke us up and made us lively, chased us into the holy scriptures to think about them more diligently and to investigate what is right, otherwise no one would think about the word. Dissensio haereticorum facit eminere, quid sentiat Ecclesia. 


False teachers do great harm in the world. 


A liar, said D. Martinus said, "A liar and a false teacher deceives people, deceives souls, and kills them, so that they do not even think it, notice it, or realize it, under the appearance of God's word; but he, a murderer, can deceive no one. So Judas is a liar and a murderer, like his father the devil. 

It is a great thing that Judas sat at Christ's table and was not ashamed when Christ said, Matt. 26:21, "One of you will betray me. The other disciples thought nothing less than that Judas would betray Christ; indeed, every one feared that he would be the one to betray Christ before Judas, to whom Christ had entrusted and entrusted the bag and all the administration and housekeeping; therefore he was held in great esteem by the apostles. 


Cap. 39: Of hypocrites and false brothers. § 10-15. 


1107 


12. from the way of the ostrich. (Cordatus No. 230.) 

It is said of the ostrich that if it has only hidden its head under a leaf or foliage, it means that it is completely covered and so hidden that no one can see it: so the hypocrites take some good work and think that all the filth of their sins is covered and hidden with it, and they are most beautifully adorned and righteous before God. 


13) Secret enemies of the gospel, false brothers. 1) 

We do not want and should not suffer that the secret enemies of the gospel and our persecutors, who nevertheless want to be called our brothers, want to trample us underfoot; unless they confess that they are such people, as they are in truth, that is, enemies of Christ and his word. But they do not do this, indeed, they boast that they are lovers of God's word, and teach righteously, and yet they secretly persecute him and his word. We do not want to suffer this, even if it should come to ruin, and we want to tell them plainly and not mince words. 


14. beware of false brothers. 

Anno 39, the 13th of January, letters came to M. Philippo from D. Jakob Schenk of Freiberg, boastful, splendid, and deceitful ones, in which he corrupted him and smeared his mouth. He reported this to D. M. Luther and said: "Whoever wants to court a beautiful woman must start with the maid. Luther answered and said, "This is my advice, which | give you, that you beware of him, and have no fellowship with him, neither in writing, nor in colloquy, nor in other conversations; for he abuses our goodwill. 


15. false Christians. (Cordatus No. 1805.) 

Clouds pass by without rain, like the false evangelicals who boast that they are Christians and yet do not bear good fruit, and Jude [v. 12.] says of them, They are clouds without water. 


1) Same content as § 3 and § 24 in this Cap. 


1108 


16. the Christians weapons and armor. 


Job says: "Man's life is a knighthood on earth", Job 7,1. A man, especially a Christian, must be a man of war and be at loggerheads with his enemies. And St. Paul describes the armor Eph. 6, 10. ff. Now there are two kinds of armor that Christians must have, one of which in Greek is called phylacteria, that is, armor to guard the heart; the other is called amynteria, that is, armor and projectile to strike and slay the enemy. 

The armor and armor, so serve and belong to the custody of the heart, are these: 

1) The belt of truth; that is, the knowledge of the pure doctrine of the gospel, which is righteous, not a fabricated and hypocritical confession. 

2) The cancer of righteousness; but this is not the righteousness of a good conscience, although this is also necessary, because it is written Ps. 143, 2: "Do not go into judgment with your servant" 2c. Item, St. Paul says 1 Cor. 4, 4: "| am aware of nothing, but therefore | am not righteous"; but is the righteousness of faith and forgiveness of sins, of which Moses speaks, 1 Mos. 15, 6: "Abraham believed God, and this was counted to him as righteousness." 

3) The boots or shoes are the works of the profession, in which one must remain and persevere, not going further nor breaking out beyond the set goal. 

4) The shield of faith. The fable of Perseus holding the head of Gorgoni in his hand rhymes with this: whoever looked at it was dead from the beginning. And just as Perseus threw the head of Gorgonis before his enemies and held it up before them, and thus retained the victory; so also we should throw the Son of God, as the head of Gorgonis, before all the evil temptations and wiles of the devil, and we shall surely prevail and retain the victory. 

5) The helmet of salvation; that is, the hope of eternal life, as St. Paul interprets 1 Thess. 5:8. 

But Amynteria, weapons so that you can use the Enemy beats and slays, that are two: 

6) Firstly, the sword of the spirit that 


Cap. 39: Of hypocrites and false brothers. § 16. 17. 


1109 


is God's word; and secondly, prayer. For as the lion is not more terrified or afraid of anything than the rooster's cry, so the devil can be overcome with nothing else but the word of God and prayer, of which Christ Himself has given us an example, Matt. 4:4 ff. 


17. likeness of a Christian life. 


Out life is like a ship's voyage. For as the mariners before them have the port to which they direct their voyage, that they may obtain it and come thither safely and out of all danger; so also the promise of eternal life is made and done unto us, that in it, as in a port, we should rest gently and securely. But because the ship in which we are led is weak, and great, violent, dangerous, impetuous winds, weather, and waves want to fall upon us and cover us, we truly need a wise, skillful shipmaster and patron, who will govern and lead the ship with his counsel and understanding so that it does not either strike a rocky cliff or even drown and sink. 

Now our ship's master and patron is God alone, who not only wills the ship, but is also able to govern and maintain it; so that, even though it is tossed and assailed from time to time by impetuous waves and storm winds, it may nevertheless reach the shore and port unharmed and unbroken. 

But he has promised that he will help us if we only ask him diligently for government and help, protection and protection, and call upon him with earnestness; and as long as we have and keep this shipmaster with us, there is no need, and we come out of all misfortune, so that the cruel winds and waves cannot harm us nor cover us. But if those who are in the ship, in the greatest danger, wilfully throw the master and regent out of the ship, who could preserve them by his presence and counsel, in that case the ship must perish and perish. And it is clearly seen that the shipwreck did not happen out of negligence. 


1110 Cap. 39: Of hypocrites and false brothers. § 17-23. 1111 


The ship's master was not to blame for this, but rather | 20. false brethren of the Christians worst enemies, as Judas among the for the willfulness and foolishness of those who were | apostles, that one should not be offended at this. 


in the ship. 

This likeness and image finely shows what the cause of our misfortune and misery is and where it comes from. 


18. Godly Christians Enemies. (Cordatus No. 65 and No. 1357.) 

The Christians are forced to suffer three kinds of persecutors, namely bad ones, worse ones and the worst ones. The first are the tyrants, who persecute us by force, and they sin against the Father, whose is all power or dominion. The second are the sectirians, who sin by human wisdom against the divine wisdom of the Son of God. The third are the false brothers, whose sin is out of pure malice against the goodness of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, they commit an indispensable sin and are the worst, they are simply Judases. Of these Christ says: "He who ate my bread" 2c. and complains about them in the Psalm and in the last Gospel. [Ps. 41, 10.; Joh. 13, 18.] "They tear down and eat our bread", that is, they hear our sermon and trample us underfoot for wages. 

Christians must endure threefold enemies because they believe and confess three persons in the Trinity. Against the power of the Father the tyrants, against the wisdom of the Son the sectirians, against the goodness and holiness of the Holy Spirit the false brothers. This is the theological proof. The grammatical one is that because some are more wicked than the tyrants, some more wicked than the sectarians, the third most wicked than the false brethren, who eat the bread of Christ and trample it under their feet out of pure wickedness. Therefore their sin is in vain. 1) 


19. a Christian is a patient. 


A Christian is completely passivus, who only suffers, both before God, because there he only receives and takes, and before the people, because there he only receives evil. 


1) The second paragraph is probably another relation of the first paragraph, which Cordatus took from another collection of Luther's speeches into his own. 


(Lauterbach, Oct. 13, 1538, p. 149.) 


No one is surprised about the fame of J[akob] S[chenk], who will have applause for a while because of his eloquence without real content [sine re]. For the vain world is always looking for something new and unusual. But when the people at court get used to his words and realize that he always plays on the same string, they will grow tired of him. After all, St. Paul complained from time to time about the arrogance of the false brethren and about the astonishing applause of the great crowd; see the whole chapter 1 Cor. 4, where he praises his teaching and the sincerity of Timothy against the pompous false brethren who only put the kingdom of God into words. It is no wonder that we are also repulsed by it. 


The world does not recognize righteous Christians. 


Just as Christ, so also we, who are righteous Christians and cling to him alone, are invisible in the world, for it does not see faith, nor does it recognize us who believe in him, just as it does not recognize Christ, who is certainly among us and in us; as he himself says, "| am with you always, even to the end of the age," Matth. 28, 20. and Joh. 17, 22. 23.:"I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one, even as we are one, | in them, and you in me, that they may be perfect in one" 2c. 


22. a Christian's characteristic. 

The characteristic of a truly devout Christian is that he is strongest in the greatest and greatest weakness and wisest in the greatest foolishness. One is understood with the senses, the other with faith. 


23. false brothers, inward secret enemies, the worst. 


Ingratitude is a very vexing thing that no one has yet to bear or overcome

The prophets have always been poor people; they have been plagued and persecuted the most, not only by external, public enemies, but also by internal, secret enemies, by their own people. What the pope is doing to us now is nothing compared to what Jeckel and Grickel are doing: they are doing us heartache, the golden friends and little brothers. But it should be so. That is why Moses rightly said: You are a strange God. 


24) From whom one shall suffer violence and injustice. 1) 


Suffering and tolerating injustice takes place and applies only when the enemies of God's Word persecute us and confess to it; but the sin of those is not to be suffered who want to be brothers and to be considered Christians, as if they were leaders. 


1) Same content As § 3 and § 13 in this Cap. 


Cap. 39: Of hypocrites and false brothers. § 23-26. 


1113 


They are of the same doctrine with us, since they falsify it in several articles and do not want to be taught or reported. When they have been admonished once and for all, and have been overcome with God's word, they are not to suffer, nor to be silent about it, but to be punished, and to oppose it, as Christ teaches Matt. 18:15 ff. Therefore, if they want to boast of the name that they are brothers and Christians, they recognize their sin and that they have done wrong, and let themselves be punished. But if they still want to defend their sin, they only freely confess that they are enemies, and then we will be satisfied and willing to suffer everything from them as enemies; but from brothers we do not want nor should we suffer it.

1. beware of sophistry. 


(This § except for the last paragraph in Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 174.) 


The world must be considered carefully because it is governed by opinions. That is why sophistical hypocrisy and tyranny prevail; true religion is forced to serve them as a handmaiden. Therefore, one must carefully guard against sophistry, which consists not only in ambiguities of words, 





but flourishes in all classes, as it has the most beautiful appearance in religion under the name of the holy scripture. There is more harm in sophistry than any human being can recognize. For our nature, which is all too inclined to the lie of sophistry, cannot see the evil, therefore Plato sets up an admirable description of sophistry: Those are not to be praised who can reverse everything and refute the sayings of others, and according to both

1. what are the biggest annoyances. 


The wickedness of the church is far greater than that of the Gentiles: for when the Christians go astray and fall away, they are far more wicked and godless than the Gentiles. Therefore the prophet Jeremiah complains in the 4th chapter of his lamentations, v. 6, that the wickedness of the daughters of his people has become greater than that of Sodom. And Ezekiel says Cap. 16, 51: "You justify Sodom with your sins." And Christ says Marc. 6, 11.: "It will be worse for the land of Sodom on the last day than for you." 

So it must be, "he came into his own and his own did not receive him", Joh. 1, 11. It makes, truly, the pious quite clumsy that they would rather be dead. As we learn today with great heartache, that many of ours give others trouble; as N. of M. 1) was much vexed, so that his cousin, even though he was a pope, was preferred to him. Therefore, one should diligently pray to God against vexation, so that his name may be sanctified.

8. aergemiss of the world. 

9. what is annoyance. 


2. the best becomes the ugliest. 


2) From the best of God's creatures come the worst; from the most pious the evil husks. For out of the church come heretics, out of the apostles traitors, out of the angels devils, out of Jerusalem, which was God's host and dwelling place, came the prophet murderers. Therefore St. Paul says Apost. 20, 30: "Even from among yourselves shall arise men speaking perverse doctrine, to draw the disciples unto themselves." Therefore the church has no outward reputation nor succession, it does not pray. Thus from Rome has come the highest profanation and the most desolate abomination. The most beautiful virgins become whores; husbands become adulterers. The same inward and spiritual aversions in doctrine always do the greatest harm, and offend the pious, much more than in life.

The first was called the early or morning sacrifice, indicating that we should first offer to Christ, not oxen or cattle, but ourselves, confessing God's gifts, both bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal, and thanking God for them. The other, the evening sacrifice, to indicate and signify that a Christian should offer to God a bruised, humble, repentant heart that considers its distress and danger, both bodily and spiritual, and cries out to God for help. 


3. argument from the service.

stoic argument, which the cane saints lead, who reject the affections and inclinations of human nature, and insist that one should willingly honor, serve, love and fear God alone as the highest good; which should be the noblest end and final cause. This is true: but God can well suffer that we love Him for His promise, and ask Him for bodily and spiritual goods: therefore He has also called us to ask, likewise to fear Him for the sake of punishment; as the prophets remind us. 

It is a good thing that man can know the eternal punishment and reward of God: and if he looks to this as the end and cause, which is not the noblest, it does him no harm if he only pays attention and looks to God Himself as the noblest finite cause, who gives everything for nothing, out of pure grace, without our merit.

6. right Christian pilgrimage. 


(Cordatus No. 828 and No. 462.) 

The present decade has had so many miraculous signs than otherwise some centuries have had, and So many changes that no one would have hoped for, as: the emptying of the monasteries, the abolition of the corner fairs, the crowd of tyrants and swarming spirits, Rome twice devastated, Muenzer who increased so rapidly and perished in this course; Zwingli perished, and shortly after that Oecolampad died in a gentler way 2c. 

All pagans serve their gods, Jeremiah says, and

to St. James, to do and pay enough for sin. But now we can make true Christian pilgrimages that please God in faith; namely, if we read the prophets, psalms, evangelists, etc. with diligence, we would not walk to God through the cities of the saints, but through oun thoughts and hearts, that is, we would visit the true promised land and paradise of eternal life. 

D. M. Luther said: That a German prince had come to Compostel in Hispania, where St. Jacob, the brother of the evangelist and apostle St. John, is supposed to} be buried. When the prince confessed (as was the custom in the papacy, and wanted to obtain a large Roman indulgence and forgiveness of sins; as indulgences were given out there, whoever gave money for them) to a barefoot monk, who had been al pious monk, he asked the duke if he was a German? When the prince confessed this, the monk said: O dear child, why do you seek this so far away, which you have much better and more abundantly in German lands? for | have seen and read an Augustinian monk's writing on indulgences and the forgiveness of| sins, in which he concludes powerfully that the forgiveness of sins and the true indulgence stand only in the merit and suffering of our Lord and Savior Jesus| Christ, in which the forgiveness of sins and the true indulgence stand only in the merit and suffering of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in which the forgiveness of sins and the forgiveness of sins stand only in the merit and suffering of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 





8. from the patriarchs service. (Lauterbach, Jan. 29, 1538, p. 17.) 

The holy patriarchs, from the creation of the world until Moses, for two thousand years, had no commandment from God to perform a specific service, and yet they offered their services and sacrifices to God. So GOt can be worshipped without a specific word of God, or their worship would have been in vain for two thousand years. Luther answered that this was an apparent and great argument, but could be resolved, namely, that the holy patriarchs had performed their services, but that these were confirmed by signs from heaven, namely consuming fire 2c. Likewise, that in those services they did nothing against the will of God, but only looked to the promised seed. Look at our papists and see if they are similar to them. Rather, they are quite unlike them, because they completely abandon God's word and the article of justification, and teach straight against the expressed will of God through their human statutes.

1126 


1. that righteous love between spouses is strange. 


A beautiful virgin in a place, who otherwise had many handsome suitors, took a priest for the sake of money; then said D. M. Luther: The money has overcome the virgin Reginen (queen). 


(The following at Cordatus No. 1091. 1092.) 


Oh dear Lord, how great it is to love wife and children very much. For the devil sets himself against this order and corrupts even our good natural inclinations. What is it therefore [to be wondered at] that someone said against his wife: If the devil had had you in hell as long as | have had you, he would have grown weary of you? 

The law incurs wrath even in civil matters. To everything we have to do, we are hurt even if you are forced by the law to marry anew woman every week; therefore, we love whores and hate women. Therefore, it is a sign of a good man if he can love his wife and children. 


2. whether a minister of the church may remain without marriage for the sake of the preaching ministry. (Contained in Cap. 22, § 151.) 


3. another question. (Cordatus No. 1163. 1164. 198.) 


If, on the other hand, they [the papists] say that celibacy is easier to bear than imprisonment, which a preacher must also suffer for the sake of the word, | reply that this is not true. For burning is harder to bear than imprisonment. But one does not have to 1) fast, because lust only grows stronger in the one who does not have the gift of chastity. | did not suffer much from heat, but the more | tormented myself, the more | burned. 

The celibate status of the pope is a sure artifice and deceit of the devil, by which he unnoticed from the church the freedom of Christ.

tears away. For if one could abstain, he should oppose it in order to preserve the freedom we have in Christ. But such a one would be forced to confess his marriage state by word and deed, and [it] need not mean silence. For Isaiah says [40:9.], "Get thee up into a high mountain, and cry, lift up thy voice with power." It is a strange thing all that is done out of immense hatred against marriage. 

In order to confirm the status of marriage, | had decided with myself before | was married that if | had had to die unexpectedly and | had suffered from an illness, | would have wanted to have a girl married to me on the deathbed. This | would have done in defiance of the pope, who more than can be said has destroyed and disgraced this state; this godless sodomite with all his orders. 


4. few believe that the marriage state is God's creation, order and institution. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 22.) 


5. image of the marriage state in all creatures. 


In the first book of Moses it is written about marriage, Gen. 1, 27: "God created male and female and blessed them. Although this saying was spoken primarily of man, it should also be applied to all creatures in the world, such as the birds under the sky, the fish in the water, and all animals that are on earth. There you will find a man and a woman, a man and a woman, 2) who keep together and forgive each other, breed and multiply. That therefore God has set before us the marriage state in all creatures, and that we should have the same image and counterfactual in the trees, in the sky, in the birds of the earth, in the animals, and in the sea in the fish, yes, even in the stones. For everyone is aware that even among the trees male and female are found, as, apples and pears, since the apple tree is the male, and the pear tree the female, and the like kind more are found on the trees. 


2) In the editions: "a hen and you". 


1128 Cap. 43. of marriage. §5-9. 1129 


And when they are planted together, they grow and get on much better with each other than otherwise. The man stretches out all his branches to the woman, as if he wanted to take her in his arms; in turn, the woman also raises her branches to the man. So heaven is also the man, and the earth the woman, for the earth is made fertile by heaven through the heat of the sun, rain and winds, so that all kinds of herbs and fruits grow from it. According to this, the marriage state is also depicted in the hard stones, especially in the precious stones, such as corals, emeralds and others. 


A husband must be a pious and God-fearing person. (Cordatus No. 449.) 


Whoever unites with a woman is without doubt a good man, but H[ans] M[etsch] is not worthy of this divine gift. Husbands and wives must be good persons, and to have peace in marriage is a gift that comes closest to the Gospel. But those who are unloving and do not care for their children or spouses are not human, but at least very similar to wild animals. 


The sweetest company and fellowship is among pious husbands and wives. (Cordatus No. 638. 1) 

A very great grace is to have a spouse whom you can trust with everything, who is a mother of children 2c. Kathe, you have a pious husband who loves you. Let another empress be, but you thank GOD. 


8. the dignity and benefit of the married state, which the world does not see. (Cordatus No. 516.) 

All works of God are hidden from the world. For who can worthily consider marriage, from which comes all offspring for the world, hence also the household, the world regiment 2c.? But although all this is very useful, the world does not see its benefits, but only its inconveniences. 


1) Cf. § 72 of this Cap. Cordatus No. 450. 


But let the papists pass away, who despise marriage so much and love whores mortally to the point of nonsense; but | want to die as a lover of the married state. 


A lewd woman is a man's greatest heartache. (Cordatus No. 674. 675. 676.) 


| regret the fate of the good man M[atthaus] A[urogallus], 2) who has a very lewd wife, and yet does not want to divorce her. If he complained, we would divorce him. Although she is not a public adulteress, yet, being lewd, disobedient, doing nothing according to his will, going about wherever she pleases, she thereby gives signs of adultery against herself. It is a very miserable thing to have an unfaithful spouse and to suffer a public rival, that hurts. For it is said that the peacock cannot suffer his equal and cannot see a rival. That is why he drowns himself when he sees his image in the water. 

These are very glorious words of the Holy Spirit [Prov. 31:11]: "Her husband's heart may rely on her", with which he describes the friendliest intercourse and fellowship between the spouses, which is not found among others. It is therefore an evil sign when one spouse rejoices at the departure of the other spouse and is terrified by his arrival. Therefore, a noble lady instructed her daughter thus: "Dear daughter, behave toward your husband in such a way that he will be glad when he sees the lace on the house when he comes home again. It is a great deception of the devil that dissolves this so great union and order of God. By natural and divine right the spouses are united and the devil takes both away by hatred and quarrels. Egg, strike todt. 

My advice to all who want to be free is that they do not joke when they want to take wives, and do not seek to be joined to them according to the lusts of the flesh and according to heat, but pray, pray. For

When a wife is taken, one must not go back if it has gone badly, and the wives one gets are dowries one gets. Just pray, it is necessary. Even if a woman is a little bitter, she must be carried, for she belongs in the house. 


10. D. M. Luther's advice on how one should marry, written to a good friend. 


(This 8, at De Wette VI, 417 f., will be printed in Theil XXI. of our edition). 


11. how new husbands are minded. (Cordatus No. 1510.) 


The first year of marriage makes one think strange thoughts. For when he sits at the table, he thinks: Before | was alone, now | am alone. When he wakes up in bed, he sees a pair of braids lying next to him, which he did not see before. For this reason, women cause their husbands many — unnecessary disturbances, no matter how busy they are, as my Catharina first did when she sat with me while | was seriously studying, and she asked me: "Doctor, is the Margrave's Grand Master brother? 


12) After the betrothal, the wedding and the wedding ceremony should not take place. (Cordatus No. 1511.) 


My advice is always to proceed to the wedding as soon as possible after the betrothal has taken place. For postponement is dangerous because of the slanderers that Satan instigates, and the friends of both parties usually start something that is not good. | know what happened to me with the marriage of Philip and Eisleben.

13. you have to have women. (Cordatus No. 1512. 1513.) 


In a woman, many good things are seen, the blessing of the Lord, the offspring, the commonality of affairs, and other such great goods that make a man 


could press. If we assume that this gender does not exist, then the house would perish and everything that belongs to the household and the world regiment. The world, however, could not do without women, even though men could beget children on their own. 

When you look back, marriage is not as evil as when you look ahead. For our fathers and mothers were holy in this order of God, even those who were not yet in the faith, for they had God's commandment of the generation of offspring, and my children see in the same way that | live in holy matrimony as | saw my parents. And marriage, which we approve of in our parents and others, we often detest in ourselves, deceived by the devil, and if we consider it rightly, we see in marriage truly divine things, why then do we despise it in ourselves? 


14, praise and glory of the marriage state, that itis a brunngnelle of all other divine stands. 


Lucas Cranach, the older, had abconterfeiet M. Luther's housewife. When the panel was hanging on the wall and the doctor looked at the painting, he said: "| will have a man paint it and send these two pictures to Mantua to the Concilium, and have the holy fathers, all assembled there, ask whether they would rather have the married state, or the celibate state, the unmarried life of the clergy? Now D. M. Luther then began to praise and extol the married state, saying that it was God's order, and without the state the world would have long since become barren and desolate, and all other creatures would also have been created in vain and for nothing, for they were all created for the sake of man; there would have been no order and states in the world. Therefore, when Eve was brought to Adam, he was full of the Holy Spirit and gave her a glorious, beautiful name, calling her Heva, that is, a mother of all living creatures. He does not call her his wife, but a mother, and adds the appendix "of all the living", Gen. 3, 20. There you have the highest treasure, honor. 


1132 Cap. 43. of marriage. §14-18. 1133 


and adornment of women, namely that they are fons omnium viventium, the fountain source and origin, from which all living people come. These are short words, but it is a wonderful encomium. And neither Demosthenes nor Cicero could ever have spoken of it so gloriously, but the Holy Spirit is the orator here, who shall declare and speak thus through our first father, Adam: and because this doctor and orator thus gloriously defines and praises the married state, we may justly cover up everything that is frail in a woman. For the Lord Christ, the Son of God, also did not despise the married state, but was born of a woman. This is no small praise of the married state. Therefore St. Paul also saw and praised the married state, when he says 1 Tim. 2, 15: Salvatur Mulier per generationem filiorum, si manserit in Fide: "The woman becomes blessed through childbearing, if she remains in faith, and in love, and in sanctification, along with discipline." 


15. God preserves the marriage state. (Cordatus No. 1522 and No. 1533.) 


God has made a cross over the marriage state, which is great, and also keeps over it, although the pope and the devil are enemies of Him, and in the marriage state one nourishes oneself better than outside. 

It is quite certain that God has been an enemy of the papacy from the beginning, for He has deprived it of the fruit of the womb. We would not have received this blessing of the body if God had not placed in us the instinct for the woman that makes children. 


The marriage state is God's blessing. (Cordatus No. 964. 965.) 


Although the women are icy, my wife violates this rule, since she is now quite hot in her illness. It is a poor thing about a woman, but by this she is highly exalted when she gives birth to children. For childbearing is God's gift, indeed, Jacob says [Gen. 33:5] that they are his children whom God has given him. And so marriage is also a blessing of the Lord, God has given his "Benedicite". 


[He spoke about it in Genesis 1:28. The world does not see this, it only sees the difficulties in marriage. That is why the bet does not say "Gratias" after that "Benedicite" of God. 

The woman is called in the holy scripture [Ezek. 24, 16] "the delight of your eyes". The Hebrews say that no one will be found who can interpret the first chapter of the first book of Moses correctly, 1) because it is the light of the whole Old Testament. 


The marriage state is necessary, and one cannot do without it. (Cordatus No. 1035.) 


It is very good that God does not want marriage to be broken, for otherwise it would perish and cease, the care of the children would be put in jeopardy, and the household would fall, and after that the world government and religion would also be neglected. However, marriage is that of the household, world regiment, religion. 

Foundation 9 of religion. 


18, unpleasantness and burden in marriage. (Cordatus No. 1103-1106.) 


The whimsical ways of women, the crying of small children, the greater expenses, burdensome neighbors, and the like are the causes that many have no desire to marry and would rather be free than submit to the bondage of such evils. 

Although the papists hate the married state because of its difficulties, they have never hated fornication, but rather loved it most of all, and this contempt, or at least this too little reverence for the married state, seems to be derived from the fathers, for absolutely none of them has written anything worth mentioning about marriage, and, like all monks, they see nothing in marriage but the lust of the flesh, since in fact nothing is more common in marriage than constant tribulation of the flesh. St. Augustine also did not speak very reverently of the marriage state. 


1) Cf. Cap. 59, § 6. 


1134 Cap. 43. of marriage. §18-22. 1135 


The fathers and all those who have been in the celibate state have avoided lust as a drop and have suddenly plunged into a whole sea of lusts and evil desires. We find only one passage in Augustine in which he speaks beautifully of marriage, saying: If anyone cannot live chastely, let him take a wife and come confidently before the court. Then he also said that it also belongs to the forgiveness of sins, if someone takes a wife not for the sake of progeny (perhaps because he cannot hope for it from a barren woman), but for the sake of necessity, and that because of marital fidelity. The good fathers could not say: Because of the faith in the word. 

God, after His great mercy before the last day, restored the marriage state, the authority and the service of the word, and caused us to see that they were His ordinances, which until then had only been thought to be His fool's play vi8]. Marriage was considered a kind of custom, authority was considered either a happiness or an oppressive burden, but not of goodness; on the other hand, the service of the word was contemptible compared to the ceremonies. 


Original sin makes the married state contemptible, but God preserves it. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: "It is a strange thing that the peccatum originis is so powerful that everyone is so hostile to the conjugio, and yet we are all born in the conjugio. Where would we be if the conjugio were not? Sapientia carnalis does not belong there. Look at all the books, they do nothing but vituperate the conjugium and pick out the incommoda: there they use all their rhetoricam and art: not, like Cicero, who teaches in rhetoricis: Incommoda dissimulanda et tegenda, et commoda amplificanda esse. That is why | love Ciceronem; et esse necessarium Praeceptum, how else would one obtain peace in the world? That is why the devil deals with it, and works very hard to bring us back to whoredom; or, if one is in marriage, that adultery may take place. This is what we see. Quia Conjugium est opus Dei, that is why he is sorry for him. That now the Con 


jugium be preserved, that is simpliciter miraculum orbis, as our Lord God otherwise preserves Oeconomiam et Politiam. How soon otherwise would a citizen have slain the mayor, or a servant have strangled his landlord! 


20. matrimonial matters do not belong before the parish priests and preachers, but before the authorities, who shall rule on them. 

(Cordatus No. 1610.) 


The pastor of Zwickau 1) writes to me about marriage cases, | want to give him a good sow, that he wants to involve me in these matters, which belong to the authorities. For these are external matters that have to do with dowry and inheritance; what is that to do with us? We advise such people [in matrimonial matters] only when it concerns conscience, and now the authorities want to impose these matters on us, and, what is more, if they dislike our advice and judgment, they do not carry them out, even if they are good. We are shepherds of consciences, not of bodies or goods. No one should take upon himself the complaints of others; they will do it without us. 


21. and there will be two One flesh. (Cordatus No. 287. [No. 1819.)) 

The two will be one flesh [Gen. 2:24, Vulg.] This is understood bodily and civilly, for the woman says of the man and everything that belongs to the man that it belongs to her, and the woman comes from the man and vice versa. 2) But in the children they are not one, except by inauthentic use [catachresin].

He was reprimanded by the bishop of Meissen's bailiff [praefecto] that he was not allowed to preach because he was not an ordained priest [and the bishop did not want to accept him; 1) because he answered that he was ordained by his wife (who had been a nun), with whom he was one body. This was an answer worthy of such a bishop. 

And thereupon he told a shameful story: That there had been a glutton, who had gone out every day to eat and drink, and had lived on a whim, but had left his wife at home to suffer hunger and grief: when he had come home, and the wife had complained that she had neither food nor drink, he had also mocked her with the proverb, saying, "Are you not full? have | eaten and drunk all day today, have you not tasted it? are | and you one body? Now she also came here, 2) and went away from the house for a day, and cooked no food for the man, nor left him any money to drink, but she ate and drank in another place. Now when she* came home again, and the man wanted food and drink, she said: Is it not enough that | have eaten? are not husband and wife one body? and mocked him again. 


23. daughters shall be provided with money, but sons shall be provided with fiefs, and in the Remain heir. (Cordatus No. 582.) 


It has been the advice of wise and wealthy people that daughters capable of marriage should be provided with money, but sons with fields, meadows and houses, and if this were not done, the inheritance of the sons would be torn apart. Therefore, the property should be left to the sons.

26. the weighting of the marital status. 


He who takes a wife, said D. M. Luther, he must not be idle, for he is a burden to him: just as keeping oneself chaste and being pious, apart from marriage, is not the least challenge, as those know who have tried and experienced it. On the other hand, the unpleasantness and burden of marriage is intolerable to people. That is why the wise pagan Socrates gave a good answer to the man who asked him if he should take a wife: Whichever of the two you do, you will regret it. 

Ah, in paradise, if man had remained in innocence, it would have been a lovely and merry thing about the marriage state: there would not have been such a heat and rage, but another kind of our flesh and blood; but we are so poisoned by original sin that there is no state on earth, which is established and ordered by God, who is not repentant, who is in it. This is the fault of our original sin, which has corrupted and devastated the whole of human nature. And indeed it seems to me that the sweetest life is a mediocre household: to live with a pious, willing, obedient wife in peace and unity, and to be content with little, to be satisfied, and to thank God 2c. And when he, D. Martinus, said this, he looked up to heaven and said: Oh, dear Lord God, how will you make it right, so that it may please us? 


27. that men cannot do without the marriage state.

and he had twenty wives. Now the friendship on both sides wanted to see which one would survive and prevail over the other. The woman died first; then he followed the corpse, had a little wreath on his head, and had her buried with pipes and drum, with a great triumph, as if she, the old hag, had now survived and retained the victory. This is what D. M. Luther said about those who soon forget their wives when they have died. 


22. Of agreement or disagreement between spouses. 


Doctor Martinus went to a princess 1) Anno 1542 and wanted to try whether he could reconcile her again with her lord. When he returned home, he said: "Dear God, what effort and work is needed in matrimonial cases! How much work it takes to bring a husband and wife together, and how much more work it takes to keep them together. Adam's fall has thus very much damaged, corrupted and poisoned human nature, so that it is most unstable, running now and then like quicksilver. Oh how good it is when married couples go to table and to bed together: even if they sometimes purr and murmur, that need not do any harm; it does not always happen like clockwork in marriage, it is a fortuitous thing; one must surrender to that. 

Adam and Eve will have been chewing on each other for nine hundred years, and Eve will have said to Adam, "You have eaten the apple: You have eaten the apple. Adam, in turn, will have answered: Why did you give it to me? Because they will have seen in such a long time of their life without doubt quite a lot of evil and a lot of misfortune with heartache and sighing in their marriage state. All of which came from their fall and disobedience, and therefore caused them to have to look at it with sighs and tears. It must have been a strange regiment, as the first book of Moses is also strange. 

Then one of them said to the doctor, "If a woman did it to a man now, he would

it would be difficult to forgive her. D. Martinus said: "If she did it, as a fool, what would he make of it? Martinus said: "If she did it, as a fool, what would he make of it? Therefore this is a blessed man who has a good marriage, although it is a strange gift. Then the doctor said: This is a martyred man, whose wife and maid know nothing in the kitchen. It is prima calamitas, ex qua inulta mala sequuntur. 


Marriage should be approached in the fear of God and prayer. (Lauterbach, Sept. 18, 1538, p. 133.) 


On September 18, Luther recounted some annoying examples of the marriage of the daughters of Philipp M(elanchthon), Lucas C(ranach) and Hans L(uft), which their daughters had committed evil. Oh, dear Lord, they do not pray. They only do this difficult thing brazenly and go about it without fear of God. That is why they are rightly punished by an unhappy marriage. That is why the epicurist D. Pistor insolently ridiculed our church wedding, that we insist on prayer in marriage. As if one should not pray about such things. He is an old fool, but will hardly change his ways, according to the saying: "He who is not beautiful in his twentieth year, not strong in his thirtieth, not wise in his fortieth, not rich in his fiftieth, should not hope for it. Age is no defense against folly. Like the bishop of Brandenburg, who was of low birth and attained his bishopric by drinking. After that, he was puffed up by great court, wanted to be held and called princely, hold princely dances, did not think that he had been a scribe. There is a great difference between nature and art, and a born prince and a made one. 


34: The freedom of spouses in the Old Testament. 


On the day of Martini D. M. Luther celebrated his birthday, to which he had invited many learned gentlemen, D. Jonam, D. Caspar Creuziger, Phil. Melanchthon, and others. Before dinner that evening, M. Ambrosius Bernd publicly advertised for his, the Doctor's,

and in good spirits. 


(The following in Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 162. The last paragraph Nov. 10, 1538, p. 164.) 


Afterwards he spoke of marriage betrothals and the privilege of a new bridegroom, to whom also the very strict Moses was favorable, so that he gave him the privilege to be free from all services for a whole year (Deut. 24, 5.). This was not done in vain, so that this status, which God has ordered by nature and divine right, and which is held in honor by all the fathers, would remain intact, and yet the pope has wanted to change it with his fictitious vows. | marvel at the majesty and power of the devil, who has opposed this most glorious divine order under the pretense of chastity and vows, as if all Christians had not vowed chastity in baptism, according to the sixth commandment, and as if chastity could not be other than in virginity, since the number of virgins in heaven is greatest. For many more virgins die than women. All who die before the twelfth year have been without evil desire. God has set this state (marriage 2) to ward off fornication. But the Papist celibate state does not swear chastity, but swears marriage. What followed from this, we have become well aware of. After that he added this advice that before the engagement the’ matter should not be told to many. If many people get in the way, it is dangerous. And after the engagement one should not postpone [the wedding] for long. And he told the case of the engagement of Philipp Melanchthon, that even very respected people

thing [substantia]. For everything is up to the two persons in this matter. It comes to us to consider it, and then to bed. Oh God, that it would remain with your order and creature and that one would not think of doing it better; we have well come to know how it was done better. 


35. praise of the marriage state. (Lauterbach, Nov. 22, 1538, p. 176; the last paragraph, Nov. 25, p. 179.) 

On November 22nd, the bridegroom Ambrosius (Berndt) had a secret conversation with his bride 2) Luther smiled at him and said: "| am surprised what a bridegroom should have to talk so much with his bride. Whether they could also get tired of it. But one must not vex them. They have a letter of right above all law and custom. custom. 

Then he began to praise the married state, saying that it was God's order and the best and holiest way to live. Therefore, it is right to begin with the best ceremonies, because of the cause, God, who wants man and woman to live together. He who wants to make it better, let him be well aware of it. Even if the woman is a weak vessel, she has the highest honor of motherhood, because all men are conceived, born and nourished through women. From them comes the exceedingly lovely offspring. This honor of motherhood should rightly cover and outweigh all the weaknesses of women, and a pious husband should say: Since we have received the good, why should we not bear the evil? So also the Roman law is very favorable to the marriage state, and gives many privileges to women, since it takes them into consideration because of 


3) Magdalena Kaufmann, Luther's sister's daughter. 


1144 


of the offspring, as also Paul 1 Tim. 

(v. 14.) Says: "I will therefore that the young widows be free and beget children. That is why all laws have had their purpose in offspring. So itis a rule in law: If someone bequeathed a thousand guilders to a virgin in his will, so that she would remain a virgin, she had the right to claim the bequest, even if she married. In short, it is a high estate if it is good; if it is not, then a man should rather choose death than have a visible devil at his side. If someone has the gift [of chastity], he gives thanks to God. Christ, Mary, John the Baptist were without marriage. The pope wanted to impose this rare gift without grace in general and wanted to make it better. When he was asked if Paul had been a husband, he answered that it was likely that he had been a husband, because the Jews used to marry early and yet lived chastely. For chastity concerns virgins as well as widows and married people, as the letter to the Hebrews teaches (13:4): "The marriage bed is to be kept undefiled." But the celibate state is actually only for virgins and unmarried people. 

The bride is always called first. That is the German way of talking, like cheese and bread. Cheese must also come first. Well, | will help with God to arrange this wedding, perhaps the last one. And he ordered that the schoolmaster with his musicians be ordered to the other day, for in the great crowd the music would have no place. For the belly has no ears. 


God Himself has ordered and preserves marriage. 


Marriage is the most beautiful order, because it is instituted by God, by whom it is also maintained. But the godless state of the pope is only a violent suppression of nature; since human life, which is otherwise very poor, laborious and short, is inclined to beget children. When a woman has had children for twenty years, she is finished. 


Cap. 43. of marriage. § 35-39. 


1145 


Marriage is the most noble state after religion. 


Marriage is the noblest estate on earth according to religion, for many reasons: but people, like cattle in the field and the world's crops, flee from it for the sake of personal misfortune; who, because they want to escape the rain, fall into the water. Therefore only go up confidently in the name of the Lord, and give yourself under the cross. Here one must look more to God's order and command, for the sake of generation, to beget children. And though this cause be not, yet it should be remembered that it is a remedy against sin, and to ward off unchastity. 

And he was angry with the jurists, who acted most strictly according to their canons and decrees, against their conscience: did not want to give way to God's word, defended secret engagements, against natural, divine and imperial law. Nor shall their canons be right. On the other hand, no one should be forced to marry, but everyone should be free to do so and answer to his conscience, for no one can be forced or compelled to love a bride. 


38. blessing of the marriage state. 


The best blessing of the married state is the children, which may never have happened to Duke G[eorg's] children, who impregnated the most beautiful princesses with dirt. The Elector, Duke John of Saxony, said: "The greatest blessing would be if children were pious and feared God. However, everything that is good in marriage is nothing other than the vain blessing of God, which no one recognizes except those who fear God and must purchase everything on the market. 


Marriage is God's gift if the devil is an enemy. 


Marriage is a beautiful, glorious gift and order, confirmed with two kinds of love: one that is natural and good; the other disorderly and evil. But the devil, who is an enemy and destroyer of marriage, does not destroy it alone 


1146 Cap. 43, Of marriage. § 39-43. ; 1147 


The love between husband and wife is not only disorderly, but also natural. That is why the ancients taught their children: "Dear daughter, behave toward your husband in such a way that he will be happy when he sees lace on the way back from the house. 1) And if a man lives and lives with his wife in such a way that she does not like to see him go away, and he is happy when he comes home, then it is well. 

God," he continued, "does not change marriage as he has ordained it, but preserves it; only in the conception and birth of his Son he has changed it. Although the Turks believe that virgins also conceive and give birth, they are not surprised that Mary became a mother and yet remained a virgin, for this often happens. But such faith does not come into my house. 


40. from the devil's tyranny against the spouses. 


One reads in the histories, 2) said D. M. Luther, that two young married couples had loved each other dearly and got along with each other quite well. Now the devil would have liked to make them disagree, that the same married couple had not loved each other so much, and comes to an old whore, to a wicked washy woman, and offers her a red pair of shoes, where she would make the married couple disagree. The old hag accepts it, and first comes to the man, and says: "Listen, your wife wants yout life. The man says, "That cannot be true; | know that my wife loves me dearly. Nay, saith the old woman, she loveth another, and wanteth to slay thee: and so make the man afraid of the woman, and do all evil. Soon the old hag also went to the man's wife and said, "Your husband does not love you. And the woman answered and said, | have a good husband, and | know that he loveth me. Then said the old maid, Nay, he will take another: therefore come before him. 


1) Cf. the second paragraph of § 9 of this Cap. 2) The same story Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, 391, § 132. 


take a shearing knife, stick it under the pillow and strangle him. The woman believes it, gains a suspicion, the mad poor fool, to the man, believes the old evil sack. The man is hard on the woman, and when he learns from the old whore that his wife has hidden a shearing knife under the pillow, he waits until the woman falls asleep, finds the shearing knife and strangles the woman. Then the old woman comes to the devil and demands the red pair of shoes. The devil handed her the shoes on along pole, was afraid of her and said: "Take it, you are worse than me. This made the old woman's evil tongue, and that husband and wife easily believed evil speech, which they should not have done; therefore it is said that husbands and wives should pray diligently in their married state. 

What do the evil tongues of the lawyers do, who also set people on each other? how will they fare? They will also get a red pair of shoes. 


41 Each one takes its equal. 


Marriage is best among equals. An old man anda young maiden do not go well together. But the money does something. Just as an old man boasted of all his treasure and showed it to the young maid. The servant let him like it and said to him: Dear maiden, he has this much more. At last, when he was also troubled by the cough, the servant said: "He, my lord, has this much more at night.

48. from the digamia. 


lam surprised, said D. Martinus, that the jurists are so much annoyed at the priestly digamy, when one takes another wife after the first, second, third, 2c. They think that such a one has no more power to preach and to administer the sacraments, since Solomon had more than a hundred, even a thousand wives at one time, and wrote such a book, which all lawyers are not able to do. So we want to bind God's word to the persons. Since we can suffer in the papacy that a sacristan or chaplain has had sixty cooks and attendants, and twenty puserons. 

The lawyers interpret the little word whimsically, if one takes a widow 2c. Oh, how there is such a great lack of understanding and ignorance in the human heart that it cannot distinguish God's commandment from man's statutes! One, the other, third, fourth 2c. Taking one wife after another is marriage, and not against God; but fornicating and committing adultery, which is against God, shall not hinder. The poor people do not know what digamia is. Lamech was the first to have two living wives at once; Jacob four: and yet they were holy servants of God. But from such examples of digamia no rule can be made in our time, nor do such examples apply to us Christians, because we live under our authority and use our worldly laws, according to the teachings of St. Paul. 

Anno 1539, the 16th of April, was spoken of the church servants, who after the first death had married another 2c. The church was in the process of being restored to its original state. Then said D. Martinus said: "Then | ask you, whether a digamus, who has married another woman, is also in the state of blessedness and a Christian? Since he is not rejected from the church and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, why should he not be considered a church servant, even if the stinking Chresem does not come to it? Satan is always looking for angle woods, arguments and wooden ways against God's order: because he cannot prevent marriage now, he invents questions about the digamia and other useless things. 


49. of king Solomon's many wives. 


One of them told D. M. Luther over the table how a book was to be printed in Leipzig in which the Bigamia 1) would be approved; D. M. Luther answered nothing to this, but sat as if he were in deep thought. Finally he said: "| often wonder how the Rex Arabiae could have seven hundred wives. Then one of [the] table companions asked, saying, "Doctor, what do you think of Solomon's wives and concubines, since he has had three hundred wives or queens, and seven hundred concubines or concubines? And the text says: "The number of virgins that were in his court was not counted"? To this D. M. Luther: One must pay attention to the fact that the holy scripture wants to indicate how many females Solomon had to maintain and feed daily; because that he had three hundred queens, these were his poor girlfriends from the family of David, who all found themselves to him, and he had to feed them in his court, exceptis Concubinis et reliquis Famulis, as he also had to feed four and twenty thousand men every day, in which the women were not counted. It is as if one would also say of the Elector of Saxony that the Elector has many wives: for he has first of all his wife, then several princesses in the women's room, then many noble maidens, item, a court mistress, then other maids and seamstresses. If one now wanted to say: The Duke of Saxony thus has many wives at court; it does not follow that they are all his wives. And how could it be possible that all these women would have been King Solomon's wives while he was asleep? Reason teaches that it cannot be. Solomon first had a wife, whom he had married when he was eighteen years old, for he had married very young; for they were very strong people. | believe, he had already had strength in the eighteenth year of a man in the thirtieth year. Then he married the daughter of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who is the other. Since he 


1) Cf. Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 1577. 


1152 


When he is old, he takes three ammonite wives. Otherwise, if he had had three hundred wives and a new wife every night, the year would have been over and Solomon would not have rested a day. This cannot be, because he had to rule. The regiment does not suffer, much deal with women. In sum, when one says that Solomon had many wives, one means that Solomon had a large number of wives. 

Then one of them asked the doctor, "Did Solomon feed the four and twenty thousand court servants in one place? He answered, "No, he had fed and paid them from time to time throughout the kingdom. Just as if one said: The Elector of Saxony feeds twelve thousand men every day: there one does not understand it: at his court, but now and then in the offices, as at Wittenberg, Schweinitz, Locha, Torgau 2c. 

After that, one of them asked 1): "Do you read anything about Solomon's resipiscentia in the holy scriptures? He answered, "No, but the saying is in there about him, quod obdormierit cum Patribus suis; therefore he considered it that he had been blessed. For this word brings it with it. For it is not written about Absalom and Joab. The Scotus has the Salomonem simpliciter damniret. 

Concubinage was left to the Jews in the Law of Moses, so that the poor widows and virgins might have victum et amictum in concubinage and be fed. This was not done for the pleasure of the Jews, but was annoying and burdensome to them: they had to do it out of great necessity, not ex libidine, nor out of avarice; but when one came to great honors in a family, or otherwise became rich, all his friends adhered to him: he had to feed them. Coacti igitur sunt, plures habere  uxores, necessitate consanguinitatis et promissionis. And the Jews will have become tired enough of them, and will have wanted that they had only one or none at all. God had promised the Jews that he would multiply their seed as the stars in the sky and as the sand in the sea. To fulfill this promise, they took many wives.

Cap. 43. of marriage. §49-51. 


1153 


Item: That the patriarchs, also the judges and kings of the people of Israel, as Gideon, David and Solomon, and others, had many wives, they had to do this out of great necessity, because of the promise. For Abraham and Isaac had the promise from God that they would become a great nation. After that, where a rich friend or cousin was, there the poor friends and little ones ran, and he had to free them, so that they would be clothed, fed and cared for. 


50 The papacy is hostile to marriage. (Except for the last paragraph Cordatus No. 1674. 1675.) 


Begetting children is not in human ability, but | believe in God the Father, the Creator of all things. 

The monks and papists shun marriage, not to avoid evil desire, but for the sake of discomfort, and although they imagine that they are very chaste through their celibate state, yet their hearts and words are far divorced from one another. Hence Paul very appropriately says [1 Tim. 4:2.], "So in glibness are liars," speaking otherwise than they have in their hearts. Daniel has beautifully pictured them [Dan. 11, 37. 38.]: he has the god Maosin 2c., which has been the fair that wears gold. And he shall stand in evil desire [after wives], which is the celibate life. These are the two pillars on which Samson makes himself. If we would allow these, harmony would come easily. But we cannot, because on these two pillars stands the Antichrist. 

Item: Satan has abominated the marriage state, which is God's order, by means of the papacy. For Cyprian writes in the booklet de Singularitate clericorum, |., that spiritual, consecrated persons should be something special; if he hears a woman speak, he should flee as from a serpent that hisses or whistles. Thus, if one fears fornication, he must fall into silent sin. As St. Hier6nymo would almost have done.

53. what marriage is. 


Marriage is a perpetual and ordained union and covenant of a man and woman; or, is an ordained cohabitation and attendance of a man and woman, according to God's order and command; or, of two covenants among themselves according to God's order. Two, | say, not many. For God thus says Genesis 2:24: "And there shall be two in one flesh." For many persons in one marriage is against the natural law. So St. Paul says Rom. 7, 2: "The woman is bound to the man because she lives." 


The first two pages of this book are devoted to the subject of marriage. 


The cause and founder of marriage are primarily God's commandment, appointment and order, and is a state established by God Himself and personally visited by Christ, and honored with a glorious gift. For God said Gen. 2, 18: "It is not good that man should be alone." So the wife should be the husband's helpmate, so that the human race may be multiplied and the children brought up in honor of God and for the benefit of the land and the people. Item 1 Cor. 7:2: "To avoid fornication,” that we may keep our bodies in sanctification. And the marriage state is pleasing to God, for St. Paul compares the church to a bride and bridegroom, Eph. 5:25 ff; therefore beware and take care not to look at 1) money and goods; 2) great lineage and nobility; 3) nor fornication. Ah, what can one say? Marriages preserve the human race, so that it remains for ever. 


55. what to consider in marriage. 


In marriage, consider these things: 1. God's commandment; 2. the Lord's confirmation; 3. Christ's worship; 4. the first blessing; 5. the promise made; 


6. society and community; 7. the examples of the holy patriarchs and archfathers; 8. secular laws and order; 9. abundant benediction and blessings; 10. the examples of malediction; 11. St. Paul's preaching; 12. natural law; 13. the nature and manner of creation; 14. practice of faith and hope. 


56. praise of a pious woman. 


(This section contains the Proverbs of Solomon, Cap. 31. 10- 31, somewhat modified and paraphrased). 


The woman is the wife of the house. (Lauterbach, Feb. 18, 1538, p. 33.) 


That evening Luther was at the wedding of Hans Luft's daughter. After supper he accompanied the bride to bed and told the bridegroom that he should keep to the common course and be the master of the house when the wife was not at home, and as a sign he took off his shoe and put it on the four-poster bed that he should keep the mastery. 


58. for what the marriage state is used. 


Before the fall of Adam, the marriage state was instituted for God's service, praise and glory, that the world might be fed by man: but after the fall, since our first parents transgressed God's commandments and sinned, and sin was grounded upon us, it was ordained as a remedy to control and ward off lust and fornication to some extent. 


59. praise of a good marriage state. (Cordatus No. 22.) 


Of his Anirathac 1) he said he held her higher than the whole kingdom of France and the reign of Venice, first, because she was given to him by God as a good creature of God, and he, in turn, was also given to her; second, because he heard here and there of other women much greater faults than were found in her; third, was superfluous cause in her that one should love her, because she did not break marital fidelity; furthermore, that she was Mother

1156 Cap. 43. of marriage. § 59-64. 1157 


and one that would soon conceive and easily give birth 2c. If a husband often considered this, he would easily overcome the disunity that Satan usually caused among husbands. 1) 


60. virgin girl. 

When a virgin who had thrown an iron was spoken of, and she was entrusted to another who took her for a virgin, Luther said, "This is called eating the cherries and hanging the basket from one's neck. 


61. Marriage is to be entered into with God. 


In the marriage state these things are: 1. that one naturally desires the other, has lust and love for him; 2. begetting children; 3. attendance and faithfulness, that one keeps faith with the other; and yet the devil shall tear it so that nowhere is there greater hatred and enmity. This makes us raise all things out of presumption, without God's counsel. 

But a God-fearing young man who wants to marry should talk to God first and say: O God, give grace to this. But this does not happen, all the masters are imprudent, they looked at great important things out of presumption and out of their own counsel. What shall our Lord God do in this? Let the man be false, who is almighty and a creator, who gives it all. Therefore, dear fellow, do as | did: when | wanted to take my wife, | asked our Lord God with earnestness. You do the same, you have never asked him seriously. 


62. marital status hostile and spiteful. (Lauterbach, Oct. 14, 1538, p. 150 f.) 


On October 14, one said of the fornication of the courtiers, who impudently asked for whores here and investigated in the houses. He answered: Oh, how the devil hates the connection between man and woman. What is permitted is unpleasant. We seek 


1) This § is from the as yet unprinted ooll6ota 6x eolloH. of Veit Dietrich, x>. 69. In the margin Veit D. has added "Ooriatus sxserlpsit". (Cordatus has written this out.) (Wrampelmeyer.) 


the forbidden. (Ovid. Amor. Il, 19, 3. Ill, 4, 17.) This is the aim of all comedies, that marriage is abhorrent to men, but they seek fornication, and he who goes to the bath goes in a dream and is not wise. The superstition of celibacy has probably helped in this. St. Jerome wrote a book against Jovinian in a very tasteless way about widows who break the first faith, as if they were not allowed to marry, since the following text clearly insists on it (1 Tim. 5, 14.): "| want the young widows to be free." Likewise, what Paul says (1 Cor. 7, 1.): "It is good not to touch a woman." From this Jerome soon concludes: "So it is evil to marry. Since Paul says "evil" i.e. burdensome or troublesome; but he explains it: worthy of condemnation. 


63 The Concubinate of Princes. (Lauterbach, Aug. 24, 1538, p. 120.) 

Afterwards one spoke of the princes secret marriage, which would be a right marriage, but not confirmed with princely splendor, that the same children also would not have helmet and shield. And there seems to be a certain similarity with the side marriage of the patriarchs, who also begot children with other women, but they did not become heirs. 


The world will soon tire of the marriage state. 


When someone once wanted to excuse the wild and desolate life of the young journeymen with fornication at Luther's table, Luther answered and said: "They thus learn to despise the female sex, even to abuse the female images, if they were not created for this purpose. He then began to speak of the state of marriage, saying, "It is a great thing if a man can always love a maiden, for the devil seldom allows it: if they are apart, he cannot bear it; if they are together, he again cannot bear it. As it is said: Nec tecum vivere possum, nec sine te. That is why it is necessary to pray diligently. | have seen many pairs of married couples who were in such a passion that they wanted to devour each other for love, but after more than half a year they ran away from each other again. How 


1158- Cap. 43- Of marriage. § 64-74. that also said to Lucas painter. It is true, it happens thus, the devil rushes together in illo ardore, that they cannot pray; primo ardent in Sexum, deinde frigent et oderunt. In a town near Wittenberg there was a couple of married people, as beautiful as one could hardly find in four "principalities": they also came together in such heat, but over a year she became a whore and hung on to the worst unfaithful, and he became a knave and hung on to the muddiest sacks, so that it was a disgrace. Why? One did not pray. The devil won the game. That's why my landlady in Eisenach said, when | went to school there, "There is no better thing on earth than a woman's love, to whom it may be given. 


65. unity between spouses. 


It is a special great grace when the spouses are at ease, and such unity is the enemy of the devil. 


66. children of matrimony fruits. (Contained in Cap. 5, § 19.) 


67. question. 1) 


One of them asked D. M. Luthern: If a young man marries an old woman who has passed away without children, is it a proper marriage? He answered: "Why not? but | would like the words of blessing in marriage to be left outside: Grow and multiply. But | do not like to make ceremonies and orders. For once begun, there is no end, and one always follows another, as has happened in the papacy. 


68 What discourages the marriage state. 


The following deter people from marriage: 1. poverty; 2. age; 3. profession or status; 4. contempt and ridicule; 5. eternal alliance; 6. the evil ways of the spouse. 


69. children should not be prodded too hard. 


One should not prod the children too hard; for my father prodded me, once so much that | fled him, and was grudged to him, until he accustomed me to him again. 


1) Cf. Mathesius, St. Louis edition, p. 219. 


1159 


The court shall decide whether matrimonial matters are to be judged and pronounced according to imperial and secular law. 


Christ, said Martin Luther, approves and confirms the authorities, Matth. 22, 21. Rom. 13, 1. ff. 1 Petr. 2, 13. 14.; therefore it follows that marriage, if the authorities allow or otherwise approve in certain degrees, which is not against God's word, is a true marriage. 


Why Moses so diligently describes the marriages of the patriarchs. 


The Holy Spirit knew well that the wickedness of human nature would abuse the female sex, namely for fornication, according to their lusts, not for marriage; therefore Moses also wrote so much and diligently in the first book about the marriage of the archfathers and the begetting of children, so that some holy monks also rebuked this, as if he had had nothing to write but about such female matters. 


72. good marriage. 2) (Cordatus No. 450.) 


A very great grace is to have a wife to whom one can entrust one's affairs, who is a mother of children 2c. Kathe, you have a pious husband who loves you; let another empress be, but you thank God.

A pious wife is a companion of life, a man's comfort; for it is written Proverbs 31:11: "A man's heart relies on her." And the good man (gold rooster) 3) shall thus be afflicted? | would run away! 

In marriage there should be love and lust, because the sex of the person brings love: nevertheless the devil can tear it apart, so that all attractions and enticements are lost. 


Marriage should be started with prayer, like all things. To whom God gives a wife, He also gives to create, gives seed and children, even the

Sixth question. Whether a man whose wife had committed adultery, or had run away from him, could marry another during her lifetime, since the second marriage would not seem to be a marriage, but fornication and adultery. He answered: Paul, 1 Cor. 7, expressly answers that this second marriage is permitted, since he says (v. 15.): "But if the unbeliever divorces, let him divorce. The brother or sister is not bound in such cases" 2c. There he apparently allows another marriage. See the comments on this passage. Afterwards he told a case in Eisenach, where the woman did not want to live with her husband and often left without any reason; finally the man was allowed another marriage, but the guilty party was forbidden. 


On October 15, a marriage case was brought forward: A groom had committed a fatal blow before the wedding and had fled to an unknown place. Was the bride free of him? He replied: it is a secular matter and he is civilly dead. If the defendant can be civilly reconciled, then marry her in the name of the Lord. 1)

Second case. A notorious adulteress finally took the household utensils and fled with her adulterer. He replied that she was to be summoned, the matter interrogated and then divorced. Such matters actually belong before the authorities, because marriage is a secular matter; with all its circumstances, it is none of the church's business, except as far as it is a case of conscience.

84. question. (Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 164.) 

[To the question, if someone kidnapped a virgin whom he loved with her will, whether he sinned, since no wrong is done to the one who consents? he answered: The violent act of kidnapping is not to be referred to the person who consented, but to the will of the parents to whom the wrong is done. 


85. cause of divorce. 


In the presence of the ecclesiastics and chaplains at Wittenberg, a divorce of marriage was discussed before the visiting judges, namely in the following case: Ten years ago, a soldier, a warrior, had been put in prison because he had wounded someone severely: But he broke out of the tower, ran away, left his wife with a heavy body; after two years he had become the executioner's servant, and demanded his wife, crying, so he wanted to get the clothes and what she had from her, and kill the child. But since she would not go to him, they were both cited before the authorities. There she appeared; but he remained disobedient outside, and has not been seen in eight years, nor is it known where he is. Finally, the woman became a boy and gave birth to two children. 

The husband was publicly cited, but did not appear. The woman brought a public confession from the people with whom she had served after the husband had left her. They gave her good testimony in their conscience that she had kept well, quietly and conscientiously with them, and knew nothing but everything good about her, except these cases. Finally M. Philip examined her, asked her about her conscience, and said: That the bond of marriage was indissoluble, which no man could nor should break; that she should report whether she had perhaps given the man cause to run away from her: she would be considered more guilty than the man, because of the adultery she had committed 2c. And let nothing be right with her, notwithstanding how innocent she was, saying, It is not so to jest with marriage: as it is written, Matt. 19:6, What God hath done is not so to be done. 


1164 


Man shall not put asunder that which he hath joined together. See that you have and keep a good conscience. And when she was departed with her succor, the bargain was consulted. And Philip said, Because the man is such a fierce, wild man, and hath left her so long without cause, and hath become disobedient, but she is presumed innocent: lest she fall into greater sin and dishonor, | hold it that we acknowledge her free and undone; and asked the assessors, the other lords, and the diaconos for their objection. They all let them have it. 

When the woman came in again with her witnesses, he, Philip, said to her, "See that your conscience is clear; but because you are considered innocent according to the testimony of the witnesses, we recognize and absolve you, not by our power and authority, but according to God's judgment and the saying of St. Paul, 1 Cor. 7:15: "If the unbeliever divorces himself, let him divorce himself; the other, innocent part is not caught in such cases." Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve and keep you, amen. And they gave the woman a written testimony and farewell. 


86. from degrees. 


M. Luther was asked: Whether Duke Moritz of Saxony's order of marriage, to be free in the third degree of unequal lineage, would be right and Christian? The doctor said: "As far as conscience is concerned, it is neither sin nor wrong before God, since Moses also allows the other degree. But nevertheless the inequality in goods and inheritance will cause confusion. For H[Duke] M[oritz] permits the nepotes, nephews, siblings, but the Elector permits the pronepotes, the other siblings, to marry each other: but in the Electorate, inheritance is not permitted in the third degree. H[erzog] Moritz and his husband are in the other degree as sibling-child. 


Children shall be married with the prior knowledge and advice of their parents, and how far away. In 1539, February 1, Luther had a lot to do with 


societies and letters, and said: "Today is a letter day, and we are going to have a letter day. 


Cap. 43. of marriage. § 85-88. 


1165 


Unwillingness: these affairs (the matrimonial matters) secretly steal our time to study, to read, to preach, to write, and to pray; but | trust that the consistoria are arranged, primarily for the sake of the matrimonial matters. At that time, he also talked a lot with D. Basilio, that many, countless cases of marriage occur, which must be moderated and judged not from described rights and laws, but from the circumstances, according to equity and the concerns of pious, God-fearing, understanding people: because one finds many parents, especially stepfathers, who are not too green to their children, want to forbid them marriage, without any cause. The authorities and parish priests should look into this and help to promote marriage, even against the parents’ will, according to the circumstances. 

Summa, if they are young people, and love each other, which is the substance and the essence or reason of marriage, it should not be refused without great important causes; But we are to follow the example of Samsonis, and the children are to report it to the parents, especially now, in the time of the Gospel, when the marriage state is in great esteem and honor, not in such contempt and abhorrence as in the papacy, when one did not act according to equity, but according to laws, straight as they were prescribed; They were allowed to freely give the bride to one and take her away from the other, so that she had to be legitimate with the first one she did not have, and an adulteress with the other one she had. Therefore, in such cases one must look more to the conscience and consider the circumstances, according to equity and the knowledge of pious, godly and honorable, loving people, not according to sharp rules and laws. 


87. Children shall marry with the consent and advice of their parents, and how far. 


Anno 1539, February 12, D. Basilius M[onner] asked D. M. Luthern for his concern: How one should deal with the secret betrothals, which were considered strong out of disobedience, without prior knowledge, advice and consent of the parents: whether one should tear them apart, or otherwise punish them in the body with imprisonment, or in the bag arbitrarily? 


1166 Cap. 43. of marriage. §88. 1167

Beware, dear fellow, of an evil conscience; you do not yet know what kind of evil worm it is; it will gnaw and bite you all your life long, even if you become a richer and more honest free woman. 


93. cause of divorce. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: There are only two reasons to divorce a marriage: The first, adultery, should be tried and diligently done, so that they may be reconciled again, and the guilty party well scolded, and a good sharp text read. 

The other cause: If one runs away from the other, and comes again, and runs away from him again. Such boys commonly have quandaries, who take wives in another place, after two years they come again, and when they have impregnated them, they run away again, without their will, one should lay their heads before their asses. 

The laws forbid that a woman should not be free again in five or seven years, but this imperial right applies only to men of war. For at that time warfare was hereditary and not arbitrary, as it is now; that is, a father who was a man of war inherited it on his children, who often had to go to war against their will. Now the coarse asses, the canonists, want to put on the rights that are directed and given to other times and causes, and say: so it is written in the book; and do not look at this time, since both, the trade and the law have fallen, and are much changed. 

They do not do otherwise, as if now a Justinianus and Roman emperor wanted to rule Constantinople according to our rights; or, if someone wanted to force with commandments, if the Elbe ran out at a place, and he wanted to stake and dam according to his opinion and prescribed laws elsewhere, wanted to be guided not by necessity and opportunity, but by the Scriptures and books. 


Cap. 43. of marriage. § 92-95. 


1173 


94. question. 


Whether a child born in the eleventh month is a legitimate legitimate child, whether it can also happen naturally? Answered D. M. Luther: | have had this case twice, that the woman gave birth to a child after the husband's departure in the eleventh month. It makes heavy thoughts, | could not believe it. Therefore, in such a case, amicable action must be taken, so that one can be persuaded with good words that, for the sake of our Lord God and peace, he, as a Christian, will refrain from something, and let him prevail, so that the wife will not be disgraced and dishonored, or at the least be held suspect for it. Rights have no place here. Just as if a man did not find his bride pure, a brat for a virgin; here one must only act kindly with good words, out of love, the law has nothing to do with it. 


How secretly or openly cohabitation makes a marriage. 


It was said how his servant should have escaped, who was in the city shouting with a maid, as if he had slept with her: would have been lured by her into the house and irritated, since she also had a bad rumor; said D. Martinus. Martinus said, "Let him stay here, especially because it is still secret, and since he would have recognized her immediately if it had not happened in marriage, he is not bound; someone can still become a fool about it. If it is secret, they may get along secretly, but otherwise she must become a whore in public. 

Therefore they shall confess it secretly. But if it is done in marriage, and she is impregnated, he must take her. Therefore, they should be advised: If it is done, let it be done; keep your consciences safe; but beware of evil examples and anger, so that we may live chastely and carefully. Not like the pope, who wanted to free and rid his priests of suspicion. If a priest was found alone with a woman in a suspicious place and was seized, one should remember and say: They would have prayed with each other. This teaching of the Pope requires great faith.

D. M. Luther complained very much about his sister's son's disobedience and hurt him that he had engaged himself without the advice of his friendship; therefore he said: | will write a strong letter to the virgins’ parents. 


100. Whether one spouse should divorce the other for the sake of religion? 


In response, Martin Luther said, "No, because secular and political ties are not severed for the sake of religion. 

One of them ran away from his wife because he had committed theft. The woman was put in prison, and since she said she knew nothing about it, she was released from prison by the request of pious people, and soon went to another country and married another man there. Now the question is: Whether it is also a proper marriage, and if the man who took her gets an evil conscience about it, how he should be advised and comforted? Luther answered and said: "If the woman could have followed the man, whether he is a thief or not, she should have done so; but because the man ran away from her, she is excused for having married another, and he who took her may well have a good conscience. 


101 D. M. Luther's concern when one spouse runs from the other. 


Ifa woman runs away from her husband and stays outside for a year, he should not take her again, because a woman must stay with her husband, should not run to and fro after fornication, and leave her husband's children sitting on his neck; the same is also true of a man. That would be my concern. 

If a fornicator is advised 1) to take a wife in marriage, and the father is against it, he will not confess it; then I, D. Martinus, say: The father should use his paternal authority according to Christian love. 


1) See Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, Col. 812 f. Lit. a. 


. §99-104. 1177 Why has he not raised and governed his son differently, so that he would not have become a whore hunter? 


102. of three divine estates. 


Three kinds of estates are ordered by God, in which one may be with God and a good conscience. The first is the household; the second is the political and temporal government; the third is the church or priesthood, according to the three persons of the Trinity. First, you must be in the household, either a father or mother, child, servant or maid. Secondly, in a city or country, a citizen and subject, or an authority. For God created mankind to be friendly and peaceful, to live together in discipline and honor. Third, that you be in the church, either a_ priest, chaplain, churchman, or other servant of the same, if only you have or hear God's word. 

Therefore | pray you, that after my death you will be most diligent and strict about the marriage state, that it may be left free, both laymen and priests, and everyone who is skilled, has desire and love, so that there may not be monasticism again; for God created male and female to be with each other 2c. And says: "What God has joined together, let not man put asunder", Matth. 19, 6. And yet the papists say: the marriage of priests is not right. 


103. common life is the safest. (Contained in Cap. 4, § 47.) 


104. difference between marriage and fornication. 


Marriage and fornication are so similar to each other as far as the work is concerned that they can hardly be distinguished; for intercourse is one and the same, begetting children is one and the same: only they are distinguished in that in marriage is God's word and ordinance or order. For God has ordained and blessed marriage, but fornication has neither God's word nor ordinance. 


1178 


God has forbidden it, maledicted it and condemned it. Also, people feel God's blessing in marriage; as the common saying goes, "If only a pious man takes a pious maid, they will be well fed. 


105. stepchildren. (Lauterbach, Nov. 14, 1538, p. 166.) 


It was said that marriages are dangerous and unhappy where there are stepchildren. Luther said: Stepchildren 2c. Yes, if the mother or father is pious, it must suffer. 


10b. The Pabst's punishment of those who have broken the marriage. 


The punishment so that the pope has condemned the part of married couples who have transgressed is evil and unjust, namely, that the man who has broken the marriage should not demand the owed marriage duty, but perform it, because thereby cause is given to fornication. | would not have them bear the punishment with a stain of shame, that they should be given only water and bread; or the like. 


The following is a list of the laws that apply to matrimonial matters. 


Doctor Martin Luther was asked: To whom do matrimonial matters belong, and by what laws should they be judged and decided? Then he said: | think that they belong before the lawyers; for if they judge and pass sentence on father, mother, children, servants, etc., why should they not also judge the life of the married couple? 

But that they pretend that one should not judge and speak according to imperial laws in marriage matters, because it is written Matth. 19, 6: "What God has joined together, let not man put asunder" 2c. Know that when the emperor and the authorities in their laws and ordinances divorce marriage, it is nota man who divorces it, but God. For "man" here means a common private citizen who is not in government office. So also God says: You shall not kill; there he bequeaths it, not to the authorities, but to common people, to whom the sword is not commanded. 


Cap. 43. of marriage. § 104-108. 


1179 


In such cases, when my conscience was troubled, | have often counseled according to the Gospel, and admonished such persons that they should not reveal such my judgment or misgivings, nor make them reproachable. And | said: Seal it; if you cannot keep it secret, then bear your danger: publicly | will not judge and sentence you in this way, because | have no execution. 

But the saying: "What God has put together" 2c., has the meaning and the opinion that the word God does not mean God in heaven, but His word, namely, to be obedient to the parents and the authorities. What else should God be? God does not put together what is done without the will and consent of the parents. And what | command my daughter and call her, she commands and calls God. If there are no parents, then the closest blood friends are in their place. Therefore, in this saying, God is called God's Word. 

Now, if my daughter is free without my will, and is secretly betrothed without my knowledge, such a betrothal divorces God: and if she knows my will, she knows God's will. For God has said it. What you humans do to them, God does to them. As is seen in many sayings in the Scriptures; as when Christ in Matthew said to the Pharisees Matt. 19:4, 5: "Have ye not read, that he which made man in the beginning made man to be male and female, saying, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh" 2c.? since Adam said: "For the authority of the parents is a divinity, because they sit here in the place of God, as his governors; as also the authority. But the world calls God happiness, when they say that God has put together; that is, the fury and the mad fury of love.

130: Of made love through little drinks. (Lauterbach, July 21, 1538, p. 101.) 


D. Jonas and D. Balthasar (Loi) told a marriage case, how someone had loved a girl in Leipzig fiercely and promised her marriage, but finally it was found out that she had given him a love potion, that she had made love to him, and after that, when he had been set right by another woman, his love for her had ceased. Then Luther said angrily: "Why do you tempt mein this quite obvious matter? The verdict is this, that he should marry her, or clearly show his authorities the circumstances that he has been deceived by the love potion. If we allowed the excuse, everyone would justify himself if he was sorry. Ah, one should not thus joke with these things. If someone feels like a man, let him marry and not tempt God. That is why the maiden has her way, so that she may give him the medicine and not cause defilement and adultery. After that, he lamented the horrible defilements in the monasteries with which the brothers were attacked almost eve night, so that they did not dare to celebrate mass th next day. But since such a large number of masses which had been imposed and assigned to us, wer missed because of our excuses, the prior came ou with it publicly and allowed that everyone could an should say mass, even if he had had pollutions. For th sake of the shameful pollutions, all monasteries an convents should be destroyed, where idle people ar fattened in good living and are daily stimulated only t these impurities by intoxication and indolence. Dea God, protect us from this abomination and let u remain in the holy state of marriage, where you ar lenient with our weakness. 


God holds above the marriage state. 


When M. Luther was asked by some preacher: about a case in marriage, he said: "That marriage i governed and preserved by God, we see publicly. Fo although the rights, both divine and human, of th authorities and ecclesiastics are earnestly 


130-132. 1187 


We see, however, that the courts and consistory are nowhere diligently appointed in marriage cases: for secular authorities do not punish adultery, indeed, they strengthen it, do not now help pious, faithful, Christian pastors, as they ought to do. Therefore, if God did not govern and preserve the marriage state, there would be endless devastation and disruption. And here one should ask God to protect and preserve His gifts, the marriage state, discipline, respectability, church, secular and domestic government. He will undoubtedly do this for the sake of His dear Son, our Lord Christ. 

But in the case of which you have written to me, you have our clear, simple and Christian answer; namely: That it is the duty of the priests to counsel the consciences of poor Christians. Therefore, if Jacob is a pious, God-fearing man, judge freely, if you are well informed of the matter. And we wish and would like the council to help you, and to keep your judgment and knowledge, discipline and honesty seriously. 


132. that the holy fathers in the church also had carnal desires, which is why they called the Colibatum should avoid and flee lonely life. (Lauterbach, Feb. 24, 1538, p. 41. The second paragraph is another redaction of Cap. 24, § 7, and therefore omitted here; likewise the last 6 lines of this same). 

After that he said a lot about the tyranny of the celibate life, how great a burden it would have been. Augustine, when he was already very old, complained about nocturnal defilement. Jerome in anguish beat his heart with stones, but he could not beat the virgin out of his heart. Franciscus made _ snowballs. Benedictus lay down in the thorns. Bernard tore himself to pieces and tortured his body in such a way that it stank horribly. | believe indeed that also virgins have temptations and rutting, but if there are also rivers and pollutions, it is no longer the gift of virginity. There is from God the remedy of marriage given and to be taken. There have been such high people in it than we are. Peter had a

Mother-in-law, therefore also a woman. Likewise John, the brother of the Lord, and all the apostles were married, except John. Paul counts himself among the unmarried and widowed, but it seems that he was married in his youth, according to the custom of the Jews. Spiridion, bishop of Cyprus, was married. Bishop Hilarius had a wife, because from his exile he wrote letters to his little daughter that she should be obedient and learn to pray; he was with a rich man, who told him that if his little daughter would be pious, he would bring her a golden skirt. So childlike he writes to his little daughter. | am surprised that the holy fathers had to struggle so hard with these youthful temptations and did not feel the high [spiritual] temptations in such great offices.

Eunuchs have more rut than all, because the desire does not pass by the cutting, but the ability. | would rather put on two pairs than cut out one. He said this on the occasion when a Waldensian had cut himself as a young man, but about which he grieved as an old man. 

Phil. Mel. said: That in Greece fornication had become so great and prevalent that celibacy, living without marriage, and virginity had been so highly exalted and vowed. Then said D. M. Luther: Terentius is very chaste in these things, he still wants to have the married state. Philip said, "Yes, Doctor, he also insists on marriage, and does not want anyone to be a virgin and free from weakness, just like Moses. 


134. you can't do without women. 


Without sin, said D. M. Luther, one cannot do without wives, one must have them. Marriage, however, is God's order and creature; therefore it is not the devil's permission if a man loves a pious maiden with honor and desires to marry her. Satan is the enemy of the state, therefore dare it in the name of the Lord, on his blessing and creation, if it is necessary for you. 


The marriage state is necessary, 1) (Contained in Cap. 43, §17.) 


136. D. M. Luther's prayer for his marriage state.

Give me isdom and strength to govern and educate them well; ive them also a good heart and will to follow your eaching and to be obedient, amen. 


137. children bind the marriage. (Contained in Cap. 5, §19.) 


138. despisers of marriage. 


The wellspring of all fornication and immorality in he papacy is, said D. M. Luther, that they condemn arriage, the most holy state. M. Luther, that they ondemn marriage, the most holy estate. For all who espise the marriage state must fall into shameful, bominable fornication, even so that they "change the atural custom into the unnatural custom,” as St. Paul ays Rom. 1:26, because they despise God's order nd creature, that is, the woman. For God created woman to be with man, to bear children and to manage the household. Therefore they take their deserved wages cheaply, despising marriage. And, as St. Paul says, they received the reward, as it should be and is due because of their error, in their own bodies. Therefore, | wish that such despisers of divine order would become serpents and basilisks out of men and die with them. Therefore, good to him who likes the marriage state. It is indeed sinful to commit fornication with a woman or to weaken virgins, as far as his own work is concerned; and it is natural and human, since man is corrupted by original sin. But to believe that marriage is instituted by God is an article of faith.

nations mock you about it. And said D. M. Luther: "So it is, we must be Lot, whose soul was tormented day and night in Sodom. We must allow ourselves and our matrimony to be mocked, when we have gloriously emphasized and praised it with our sermons, writings and examples. But there is an epicurism in the German country, which comes from Italy, and we Germans are even being led astray by it.

one. And such epicurism rules in Turkey, too, that no one asks anything about the marriage state, but everyone takes as many wives as he wants, pushes them away and then drives them away again, or sells them and swaps horses with the wives, because they do not know what the marriage state is. But we have helped the marriage state back on its feet with our books. 

| am very much afraid that in twenty years all good books will be banned, that none of them will be remembered in the pulpit, and that only pious hearts will keep the pure teaching of the divine word. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ help us, he alone is honest and takes care of us; the others mock us, as they mocked Noah before the flood when he built the ark, and as the Sodomites mocked Lot, and they mocked the prophet Isaiah with outstretched tongues. In the same way, Annas and Caiphas considered Christ's teaching to be a mockery, just as our Moguntinus] still ridicules our teaching, knowing full well that it is the word of God. Well, we must pray, God will find the mockers, veniens venie with the punishment, et non tardabit. 


160 On Adultery. Two kinds of adultery. 


Doctor M. Luther once said that there are two kinds of adultery: The first is spiritual, before God, where one desires another's wife or husband, Matth. 5, 28. No one escapes from this. The other is physical, as John 8:4, a woman in public adultery. Such is a shameful vice, but yet it is regarded in the world as an honor. And a good man once said to me, "I would not have thought that adultery was such a great sin, for it is a sin against God, against the government of the land, the city and the house, and an adulteress brings a strange heir into the house, and deceives the husband. 


161. cause of adultery. 


When one at Wittenberg had broken the marriage, there asked D. M. Luther's housewife

. § 159-162. 1197 the doctor and said, "My dear sir, how can people be so wicked and stain themselves with such sins? Then he answered and said, "Yes, dear Kathe, people do not pray, so the devil is not idle; therefore we should always pray against the devil of whores: Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. 

And said further to his table companions: | consider that if God had commanded that a woman should admit whoever came; and again, a man who came; then one would have grown tired of the lewd life very soon, and would have sighed very hard for the married state. For: Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata. Item: Quod licet, ingratum est, quod non licet, acrius urit.

So a bachelor should also remember to take his own wife and avoid fornication. 


162 History of how a woman's adultery was concealed by her husband. 


In the county of Saxony, a nobleman's wife, said D. M. Luther, has married her nobleman's servant. Now the other servant notices this adultery and secretly reveals it to his lord, who was very frightened about it and at first did not want to believe it; however, he consults with the same servant how he would like to seize the adulterer. Then the servant says: "We want to find out how: Let my servant pretend that he is going on a long journey, since he will not be back in a few days, so the servant and the woman will soon find each other. Now the lord follows the servant, and stands as if he wants to travel far over the field; but order with the maid that he be let in again secretly, and 


1198 


came home again the first night. He hurried with the servant to the wife's chamber, where the adulterer lay with the women inside. Now the nobleman considered what he would do if he were to commit adultery with his wife in public, that he would come to a great cry in the whole country, and his wife would become quite infamous, also her children would have to have it an eternal imprint. And he thinks of the cunning and handle that he sends his servant down to the house to light a light. In the meantime he knocks at the chamber, and says: Hans, get up quickly, and save your life, roll yourself into your chamber, and lie down in your bed: for, if you will do it, then | will promise you by my noble faith and loyalty that no harm shall befall you. The servant unlocks the chamber, secretly returns to his bed and lies down in it. When the other servant returns with the light, he knocks on the chamber with earnestness, having only a sword in his hands. Then the woman opens the chamber, then the man hurries to the bed, there was no one inside. He looked for the adulterer everywhere under the bed, but he did not find him. 

Then the nobleman was very angry and mischievous, and he said to the servant who had revealed his wife's fornication and adultery to him, "Behold, how do you stand with your accusation? Behold, how you have put me, my pious wife and my poor little children to shame, scorn and ridicule! Go, see if the other servant is in bed in his chamber. When he found him snoring, as if he were in a deep sleep, and told the master again, the master said to the same servant, "Behold, here is your reward, and roll yourself out of my house, and do not come back to me. In the morning he also gave the adulterer his farewell. 

M. Luther then said that this nobleman, with his prudence and great gentleness, had won over his wife, that she had renounced fornication, and had then lived modestly with her husband, and had also kept his wife and children in honor. Such prudence and wisdom, said Luther, | would not have found in myself, nor could all lawyers have done so.

163. the garden brothers’ fornication. 


D. M. Luther said that the garden brother Hetzer had slept with twenty-four married women. For if a beautiful woman had come to him, he would have said, "Dear wife, you are on the right path, but you are still lacking one thing: You have a hopefulness with you, which you must do away with if you want to become perfect, and that is it, you have never broken your marriage, therefore you are hopeful before another woman. But this is the devil. Therefore, if you want to be perfect, you must not have this hope. With this he deceived many wives. Now when he was to be judged and die, he also went into bus correptam. ') For this was his last word was: HErr GOtt, wo soll ich hin 2c. 

In a town close to the Swiss border, where this agitator had been, it finally happened that if someone was found to have committed adultery and gave the authorities only four guilders as a punishment, he went free and became a devilish creature of fornication there. And there the devil set up such a game that once a man came home from the garden brothers and saw something sour. His wife asked him what was wrong with him. He answers and says, "Go out to the garden brothers, and you will find out. When she comes out, the garden brothers are here and fornicate with her. But she comes home again, weeps, does evil, and says to the man, "Oh, what have you done to me? Then he answered, "This is what | wanted, for | have also done it to other women. So he willfully made his wife a whore. 


164 History of how adultery has been punished. 


Because the lewd devil was not respected in that city, and the people mocked our Lord God as an epicure, and set four guilders as a penalty for adultery, they also had to be paid.

there: That a rich citizen there, one of the families, suspected his wife of booing with the servant, and yet could not get to the bottom of it. Now the servant had once taken the master's pants with him into the chamber, and the master came about into the servant's chest, and found his pants therein, and began to deceive him. And because he had a sign, he confronted the woman. But the woman sought the door, and ran to her friends, and bewailed it unto them. And because she had good friends, they bargained with the man and finally invited the woman back. But the resentment would not leave the man's heart. Now it happened one Sunday that the husband sent all the children and servants out of the house and told them to go to church, leaving only the wife and one child at home, whom he considered a whore child. Then the man put a knife to the woman's breast, and she confessed that she had committed adultery with the servant. Then he stabbed her and strangled the child, and he went down to the ground and threw himself out of the window into the street, and snapped his neck in two. When the dead corpse was found on the gaff, it was reported to the council, who had it picked up. There they found a note with a rope tied to his knee, written to the council, in which the man had told the whole story of his wife's adultery, and that he had punished her himself for it, and also that he had given birth to the child so that it would not have to hear the accusation that it was a whore child 2c. Thus the people of the same city were punished for fornication. 

This story was told by D. M. Luther in Torgau in 1536, when Duke Philip of Pomerania had a wedding camp there with the Miss of Saxony, and D. Pommer had to say it publicly in the wedding sermon (because D. Luther became ill, that he could not do the bridal sermon), and this story should serve that married couples should beware of the devil, and live in the fear of God, pray diligently, and beware of fornication and adultery. 


theft. 


In the month of February 1546, in Eisleben, D. Martinus Wolf asked Schrenken and Joachim von Barbi, among others, who were eating with him: What is the reason that theft is punished more severely than adultery? For whosoever sinneth against the first, second, third, fourth, fifth commandments, committeth peccatum mortale; but the — sixth commandment is not mortale. For we execute a thief if he steals five or six pennies; why then do we not also put to death an adulterer? For adultery is, verily, also a great theft. If an adulterer were punished alive and his head cut off, we would not have so much to do with the quaestionibus of adultery now. Then we come and ask: If the guilty party, as the adulterer, wants to repent, and the other innocent party does not want to accept him for mercy, should the guilty party remain in his sins, or should he be allowed to take another wife? If one lets him, others will want to follow the evil example, and thus one gives cause for much evil. That is why | would like to see an adulterer's head cut off straight away. 

Julius Caesar, although he himself was an adulterer, nor did he make a law that an adulterer's head should be cut off. And the doctor said: "It happened in W. that a pious, honest woman, who had four children with her husband, and who had not known anything evil of her before, was taken in adultery. Now the husband insisted so hard that she should be beaten to distemper. That is what happened. After the punishment, I, D. Pommer, Philipp Melanchthon talked with the woman, she should go back to her husband, and the man also wanted to take her back to him. But she did not want to, because the public disgrace hurt her so much, and she left her husband with the children and went astray. But there one should have acted de reconciliatione before the punishment. Here we see how the devil is such a mighty lord of the world. The priest goes straight through; whoever has broken, remains without marriage, and the innocent part is not allowed to be free again. 


1202 Cap. 43. of marriage 


166 History, so the Lord D. M. Luther has told at that time, how cruelly God punishes adultery. 


There was a canon in S. who kidnapped the wife of a nobleman in the country, who had several children with her husband, and kept her with him for almost a year. In the end, the nobleman made such an announcement that he found out that she was in S. with the canon, so he asked the city council to open the gates for him and let him take his wife back from the canon, which was done afterwards. Therefore, on Christmas Eve, when all the canons must be in church, he went to the canon's house and knocked on the door in haste. When he came up to the parlor, he found his wife lying in six weeks. Then he says to her, "If | find you here, you whore, is this your faithfulness and faith that you promised me? Get up, you must leave with me. The woman is frightened and says: "Dear nobleman, | am six weeks old, | cannot leave, spare me, it shall not happen again. The nobleman said, "No, you must leave with me." He pulled her out of bed and put her on his horse, which the servants were holding in front of the door, and brought her home: He had a room, a chamber and a secret chamber built for her, and walled her up; however, he gave her enough to eat and drink during the time she was alive; but she did not return to his side, and he went to her every day in front of the prison and comforted her that she wanted to be patient, because she deserved a harsher punishment. This was a wise man who, for the sake of his children, did not want to punish the adulteress publicly. But she did not serve two years in prison, and then she died of grief. 


167. another history. 


In Zeiz, a canon raised a virgin, whom he gave in marriage to a baker. Now the canon came daily to the baker, ate and drank with him, and acted friendly towards the woman. But when the man finally realized what the bell had struck. 


. § 166. 167. 1203 then he forbade him the house, that he should abstain from his house and the woman. But the canon did not refrain, but when he noted that the man was not at home, he came away and was merry with the woman. Finally, the man said he was going away to buy grain and would not come back in four days, but he hid secretly in the house, in a place above the stairs, so that he could see what was happening in the whole house. 

The canon came back to the wife, was happy with the wife according to his custom. When the man saw the right time, he hurried to their room, found them together, stopped the canon so that he could not get up from the wife, shouted to the neighbors, who soon came to his aid, found the whore and the boys together, and soon sent for the court, which led the canon to prison. But the chapter practiced so much that he got out again, and neither he nor the adulteress were punished. This angered the baker, who sold everything he had, left, and became the enemy of the chapter. For more than two years the adulterer, the canon, went to church in a village. The baker found out about it, fell into the village with twelve men, and stabbed the canon to death. Thus God ultimately punished adultery. 

Item: In E. Bishop Hugo studied at Costnitz and married a burgess who had a pious, honest husband with whom she also had children. When Bishop Hugo left, he took her away with him. The burgher then made great inquiries as to where his wife had gone and would have liked to have her back for the sake of his children, but he could not find out. For several years, when the bishop grew tired of her, he chased her away from him. Then she wrote to her friendship and to the man, asking for mercy. When her friendship had long bargained with him to take her back to him, he answered and said, "I will feed her, but she shall not come to my side again. So she went astray all the days of her life. 

Wolf Schrenk said to D. Luther: "That in the Voigtland half of adultery four deaths would have happened at once. For since they, the- 


1204 


Buhler, having been in the parlor with the wife, the man came in with a pig's spear, stabbed one of them to death by the wife; the other two came out to the parlor on a wall, where they jumped down, thinking that they wanted to get away, but they had both fallen on their necks; after that he stabbed the wife as well. 

Item: In V. it happened that one of the families booed a citizen with his wife. The man noticed it, pretended to move away, but early in the morning he secretly returned to the house and hid in the dovecote, fasted and thirsted all day. The squire came at noon, panketirte with the woman and were in good spirits, the evening of the same, until they went to bed. When they had all gone to rest in the house, the man came out of the dovecote, would have liked to eat something, came into the kitchen, but found nothing, only a jug of water: he picked it up and drank from it, wanting to quench his thirst. And when he set the jug down too hard in anger and wrath, it clapped so hard that it broke. The woman in the chamber heard this, got up (because the conscientia, she stirred), stepped into a window, called to the maids what was there. But since everything was silent, she went back to the adultero in the chamber. Then the man sneaked into the room, because he had the keys to the chambers. When he saw his harness and a riding crop hanging in the parlor, he took it off and put it on him, and when the harness rattled on him and the woman heard the rattling, she got up again from the adulterer, went into the parlor, and asked what was going on there. But since the man was silent, she went back into the room in the dark. There the man forced his way into her room. When she saw this, she hid under the bed. But he hurried to the bed and struck at the adulterer (who had a pig's spear by him), 1) who also jumped out of the bed and put up a fierce fight. But when he could do no harm to the man, who had a harness over him, and was tired, the man stabbed him, and then said to the woman, "Come out, you whore,

or 2) | want to stab you too. The woman crawled out and begged the man to let her live, she did not want to do it anymore. But when she saw that she could not soften the man, she said: "Dear man, give me time to confess first and to receive the holy sacrament. The man said, "Are you sorry for what you have done? The woman answered, "Yes, dear husband, | am very sorry. Then the man drew his sword and stabbed her as well. Put the adulterer and the adulteress both together and go away. In the morning the adulterer and the adulteress were found lying dead together. Then everyone said, "It has been done to him. Finally, the man returned to the city, but his friends advised him to sell what he had and go to another place for the sake of the young man's friendship. 

These histories were all narrated by D. M. in Eisleben in 1546. 


168) How fornication has been punished. 


Doctor Martin Luther remembered the canons of Naumburg, and said: That they once had a whore of nobility with them, so that they had committed great fornication. When this whore had committed a great deal of fornication and always wanted to be preferred to other honest citizens’ wives, the Naumburg council had them lie in wait and catch her in the alley and lead her into the common house. This annoyed the canons, but they soon got rid of her. Now she thought of an opportunity to avenge such scorn and insult on those of Naumburg; and when she was once asked to a wedding and stepped in front of the mirror, began to adorn herself beautifully, the devil possessed her, and was badly plagued by him, and died after three days.

Our Lord God will gladly repay this a little before the end of the world.

What the vow of chastity is. (Lauterbach, Feb. 7, 1538, p. 25.) 


It has been and still is a vain abuse [with the pope]. For what is the so highly praised vow of chastity with its pretense but a cursing and cursing of the very holy marriage state, where every unmarried person contradicts the marriage state with flowery words and conspires the marriage, not for a time, but forever? 


The fathers’ misconception about the state of marriage. (Lauterbach, Aug. 27, 1538, p. 122.) 


On that day, much was said about the errors of the holy fathers, who wrote nothing worthy of the marriage state, but rather were deceived by the unclean, celibate life, from which so great abominations arose, and unfortunately did not see that the marriage state is instituted in both the Old and New Testaments. For God has joined a man and a woman. Abraham, a very pious patriarch, had three wives. Christ went to the wedding and confirmed them. Paul wants a bishop to be the husband of one wife, and proclaims future dangerous times when marriage will be forbidden. We see so many sins, incest, fornication, rivers, as the letter of St. Ulrich laments. But all of this is put down by the beautiful appearance of the conjugal life. The first fathers were pious people, they meant it devoutly, but they did not see the evil that follows from it. Oh, if only Christians could still keep the marriage bed undefiled! And those servants of the belly want to bind the bodies and consciences with laws, which, since they are very dangerous, even the holy fathers could not keep with the best will in the world. O dear God, this is what happens when we lose God's word and the article of justification. 


The hypocrisy of celibacy and celibate life. (Contained in Cap. 30, § 34.) 


Cap. 43. of marriage. § 174-179. 


1209 


177. horny forbidden. 


At the Concilio of Nicaea, said D. M. Luther, it is strictly forbidden that no one should lust after himself; for many of them, out of great impatience, since they were so troubled by fornication and heat, have lust after themselves by force, so that they may remain skillful and capable for church offices, and may keep the benefices. 

Truly, they have been great fools who, with many laws, have taken it upon themselves to forbid lechery, and yet have not wanted to allow marriage, which is God's order and command, to go freely or to be permitted. It is indeed a strange and unfortunate mandate and prohibition not to permit marriage, when the holy man and bishop Paphnutius calls the conjugal partnership chastity. 


178 Fruits of celibacy and celibate life in the priesthood. 


The shameful and harmful superstition of celibacy and celibate life of the clergy in the papacy has prevented many good things, namely: begetting children, the police and the household; has given great cause to abominable sins, and promoted these, as fornication, adultery, incest, rivers, lewd dreams, strange dreams and visions that occur to one in one's sleep. Pollutiones and defilement 2c. Therefore St. Ambrose writes in his Hymno and Canto: Procul recedant somnia et noctium phantasmata etc., ne polluantur corpora. 

These trials and temptations were felt by St. Ambrose, who was well tried and practiced with many and various sorrows; what should not lazy, tired, fattened mast-heads, the monks, feel? Oh, dear God, the thing that God created cannot be helped in this way. For what is that different from wanting to force and dampen the natural creation? 


179) At what time celibacy began, and how long it lasted. 


Celibacy and the celibate life of the clergy began at the time of Cyprian, who lived two hundred years after Christ's death.

Gregory had gone out, that the pope then wanted to fish a deep pond in Rome, which was located near a nunnery, and the water from it was drained, then one had found in the same pond at six thousand children's heads, which were thrown into the pond and drowned. These are the fruits of celibacy. And Sanct Ulricus wrote that Pope Gregory was very frightened by this spectacle and repealed the law of celibacy. But the other popes, who succeeded Gregory, re-established the celibacy. 

Luther said that in our time it had also happened in Austria that there had been nuns in the monastery of Neuburg, who had been expelled from it because of their ungodly, licentious nature and taken to another place, and Franciscan monks had been placed in that same monastery. When the same monks wanted to build in the monastery, and the foundation was dug, ‘ twelve pots were found in the earth, on which lintels

Bishop Albrecht of Mainz said in Nuremberg in 1532 that he would rather omit the Lord's Supper in both forms and do away with the Mass altogether, than that he should let the Cdlibatum go. Well, said D. Luther, they do not want to do it with good, but they still have to do it. It is a terrible speech. Our Lord God will practice the Deposuit potentes de sede with them in the Magnificat, God will defend His honor, and they will sing the asses' song, starting high but ending low. 

The Bishop of Salzburg had said at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, Anno 1530, to M.Phil. Melanchthon, 1) said D. Martin Luther: Dear Philippe, we know well that your teaching is right; but do you also know, on the other hand, that no one has ever been able to gain anything from the priests? You will, 1) also not be the first.

Cap. 44: Of the authorities and princes. § 1-5. 


1217 





1. authority is a sign of divine grace. (Contained in Cap. 2, §142.) 


2. difference among parents and the authorities. (Contained in Cap. 3, § 63.) 


God punishes through the authorities, who are His servants. (Cordatus No. 734, except for the Latin.) 


The authorities are like a fishpond, but God is the sturgeon, 1) who reaches the fish into the fishpond. When a thief is ripe, he reaches it in, it must be caught. Therefore it is written [Ps. 58, 12]: "God is still judge on earth." Therefore it is necessary that the wicked either come to repentance or to punishment, 1) An outstanding thief, who, at the age of sixty, was seized in Wittenberg, answered the mayor, who asked him in prison: "As we do, so it goes. 


Tu supplex ora, tu protege, tuque labora! Id est: 


Sacerdotes doceant; Magistratus defendat et protegat; agricola colat agrum; et reliqui artifices faciant, quod prodest ad conservationem societatis humanae. 


4. authority is natural and divine right. 


That the authority is founded in the fourth commandment can certainly be proved. Cause, obedience is necessary, so is the parents' power and authority also necessary: if then the parents’ authority vanishes and the children's disobedience increases, so that they no longer want to be drawn nor to be obedient, then natural law and reason teach that children have guardians to help them draw, then the authorities must be guardians. Therefore the emperor is the guardian of all parents. 

God could only by his omnipotence in another way, through another means 


1) In the original "Stark"; the Hallische Handschrift, Bindseil |, 301, "Stirle"; Rebenstock I, 146 b iustruuwntuin; Aurifaber "Storer," likewise Stangwald. 


2) Cf. cap. 9, §19. 


He can control and prevent the disobedient children, but he needs the proper means that he has set, namely, the authorities. 

Therefore, father shall remain father. If the father's authority and power are extinguished and forfeited, the authorities take his place. But since the authorities cannot or will not punish, the devil comes and punishes. Therefore the saying remains true: What father and mother cannot punish, let the executioner or the devil punish; they are our Lord God's executioners. 

But here one wants to say: The father does not have the power to kill the son, therefore the authority should not have it either? Answer: The authorities are the servants of the parents, and the will of the parents is the will of God. He says and commands that disobedient children should be put to death, as there is an expressed command of God in Moses to put the disobedient son to death, even though the father does not want to. 


5. authorities shall keep above their laws and orders. 


Princes and rulers must keep above _ their mandates, orders and ordinances, otherwise they will be despised. That is why the peasants, burghers and nobles think that if a ruler does not speak himself and give verbal orders, it is not the ruler's word or mandate and command. So it is with our Lord God. When D. Pommer, | or another faithful teacher preaches, the scorners go there and despise it, saying: Our pastor has preached, they do not realize nor believe that these are Christ's words, who speaks through them himself, as he says: "Behold, | send you" 2c. "He that heareth you heareth me," Luc. 10:3, 16. Therefore, if our most gracious Lord will not keep above the visitation, it will be nothing with us. 

(The following at Cordatus No. 1165-1170.) 


All authorities should rightly love the Gospel and by love kiss it daily, because now everyone can act in his office with a good conscience, which none of them could do under the papacy, since they were taught by the monks that they were (at least) in a dangerous state, because the papists could not distinguish between a private and an official position. 


1218 


The executioner had to 1) atone for what he would do to the condemned beforehand. The executioner had to 1) atone, to beg the condemned beforehand that he would do to him as if he sinned who sentenced a guilty person to his punishment. 

Since it is the actual office of the authorities to condemn the obviously ungodly, but they asked forgiveness from the guilty because of the verdict passed, it is certainly not doubtful that every authority under the pope did not recognize their office, but their teachers did not understand what Paul says [Rom. 13, 4.]: "She does not bear the sword in vain, for she is God's servant." Therefore, her students did not know it either. GOD commands that the wrongdoers be punished, as | [command] that my disobedient son [be punished], and since these are punished, the execution of his command pleases him, as it pleases me when my son has been chastised. But if someone wanted to beat my son without my command, | would not suffer it. 

The Elector Frederick did not like to punish and said: It is easy to take life, but you can not give it back, and therefore the Elector always said: Hey, he will still become pious. The emperor Frederick [Ill.] was always angry, as often as the cities asked him for jurisdiction (as they used to) every year (annuatim). This art had been taught to them by the monks, by whom, for the sake of their clemency, the lands were filled with evildoers and they ceased to exercise justice. 

God, whose mercy extends over all, says after all according to His justice [Ex. 21, 17.]: "Whoever curses father or mother shall be put to death", even at the altar, only the head off, and "You are a righteous judge" [Ps. 7, 12.] and the land shall be cleansed from robbers. 

The lawyers with teaching, reading, deciding tear off the heads of the people, without that the executioner must probably keep peace. D. Hieronymus Schurf, a very good jurist and Christian, has not come to the point where he would have had the heart to convict someone with a good conscience. 


1) In the original: The executioners had to 2c. 


Cap. 44: Of the authorities and princes. § 5. 6'. 


1219 


The preachers are of all the greatest slayers, for they admonish the authorities to be strict in their office, to punish the guilty. | have slain all the peasants in the uproar, all their blood is on my neck, but | point it to our Lord God, who has commanded me to speak such things. But the devil and the wicked who kill are not right. He who considers and knows this diligently has learned something important. Our authorities today know very well how to distinguish between a private and an official person, and they recognize the right they have, but they abuse it very much against the gospel and its servants. This shall not prosper them. 


The authorities should always remove and punish evil. 


D. Luther once said that Joab, King David's captain of the field, must have been a free man of war, for he set it. freely on his fist. And having only six hundred men with him, yet he meets with all the people of Israel, and smites them. For he has thought: | have good old men of war with me, who have often been in earnest before, but they are a great people, huddled together everywhere, and marching without all order; therefore he attacks them and puts them to flight, and it is too much for him. But | think that David would not have liked to have been stirred up against Absalom's son to wage war against him, but his captains persuaded him to do so and put him in armor. Therefore he commanded the captains to spare Absalom the boy. But Joab's counsel is the best, namely, with bad boys only down, because they do not become more pious, but they cause one misfortune over another forever. 

Once a boy of eighteen was imprisoned for theft. Now the judge and the jury would have gladly released him from the gallows for the sake of his youth and let him go. Then he said, "Go away with me, for | am three years old; if you let me go, | will start stealing again, just as | did before. 


1220 


| have left. Therefore, whoever deserves death should always be put away. And D. Luther told the old saying: A thief is nowhere better than on the gallows, a monk in the monastery, and a fish in the water. And Luther said that he had asked for some from the gallows, that they had been given life, but after a few days they had stolen again, and were hanged immediately afterwards. Therefore Joab's counsel was much better than that of King David. 


7. authorities and jurists need forgiveness of sins in their office. (Cordatus No. 1252.) 


The authorities and lawyers must be strict and necessarily sin, because, since they are officials, they do either more or less in their office than they should; and the same happens to them as to the best craftsmen, who may have the skill to work, but do not have suitable tools with which to practice their art, as a carpenter who has a sharp axe loses all, or at least much, of the work applied to his art. So also the authorities, although they are good and appointed by God, do much evil if the private persons with whom the authorities have to deal are evil. It is no different for preachers when they have somehow deviated from the Word or have given in to their passions, carried away by the very great malice and ingratitude of the mob. 


8) Where it comes from that the authorities sin and do wrong. 1) (Here a paragraph is omitted because contained in Cap. 26, §30.) (The following paragraph Cordatus No. 350.) 


Ferdinand extorted immeasurable money from his own, but God gave him a blessing similar to that [which those get] who have their handful of feathers. So his money dusts from one another. Thus he is also the first king of Bohemia and the last of the Romans.

1221 


9. ungodly princes, ungodly councilors. (Lauterbach, June 28, 1538, p. 92.) 


It is impossible that where there are godless kings, there should be pious counselors. For the consequence is inevitable: Where the bishop of Mainz is a liar, D. Turk must also be evil. As Solomon says Prov. 29 (v. 12): "A lord who delights in lying, his servants are all godless." 


10. For the authorities, one should ask. 


Authority is a necessary order and status in the world, and to be held in honor, therefore one should ask God for it, because it can be corrupted and corrupt, nam honores mutant mores nunquam in meliores: for honor changes life, makes other senses, words, deeds and works, but never or seldom better, become very soon and easily tyrants: for he who rules without laws, and wants to have his head straight, what he thinks and does, that shall be right: he is a beast, worse than an unreasonable wild animal. But aman who rules according to written and established laws is like God, who is the founder of justice. 


11. how authorities shall be sent, and by the princes of Anhalt. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1021.) 


Today | had a very theological meal [prandium] with the brothers Herren von Anhalts, who are like virgins in manners and modesty and talked about nothing but God's word during the whole meal. 

All three brothers, Prince John, Georgius, Joachim, are sincere princes, princely and Christian mind. This is what fine God-fearing parents do, who bring up their children well, and it is a work of the fourth commandment of God, who will also bless them. Ask God that they may remain steadfast in the pure doctrine and not be persuaded against it by other princes and tyrants. 


2) Luther was (cf. Cap. 22, § 13) on Nov. 24, 1532 in Worlitz, together with Melanchthon and Cruciger, with the princes Johann, Joachim and Georg von Anhalt.

Cap. 44. of the authorities and princes. § 16-20. 


1225 





The mayor of Nuremberg, who had been cheerful and amusing in his youth, was remembered above the meal, and then came to great trouble and work in the government. 


17. god, and not laws, receive a regiment. 


A worldly regiment (said D. M. L.) is not maintained by laws and rights alone, but by the divine authority. God maintains it, because otherwise the greatest sins remain unpunished in the world. Just as in theology we punish only the smallest sins. Zwinglius and Oecolampadius, who are great sinners, pass through, and nothing is done with them. Our Lord God indicates in the laws what His will is, how evil should and must be punished, and because great princes and lords do not punish the laws, because they cannot do it, they are too weak, our Lord God will do it once. In this life the lawyers can only catch gnats and flies with their laws, but the great bumblebees and wasps tear through them as through a spider's web, and want to be unpunished. Of this also the pagans, as Cato, have said: Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas. Therefore, God must hold sway over the regiment, and they are not protected and preserved by laws and books alone, but by God. 


18, preacher's testimony. 


It was asked whether an authority also has the power to ask a preacher about adulterers when he has scolded them severely? Answer: No. For an individual's testimony does nothing. What | know, | can prove; what | cannot prove, | do not know. 

Item: It was also asked whether the authorities would do right if a poor imprisoned thief had secretly confessed to the chaplain that he had stolen so much that he would be executed, so that they would force him, the deacon, to say what he had confessed and confessed? M. Luther answered and said: "No, as long as God is silent, the chaplain, or the one who heard his confession, should also remain silent. For 


The one who confessed it to him did not confess it to a man, but to God, in whose place the priest sits, therefore he should keep it secret. And for the reason that a man's testimony alone is not valid, we do not permit a secret betrothal, for because it is a man's testimony, it cannot prove anything. 


19. what kind of people belong to the government office. 


The regiment does not include common, bad people, nor servants, but heroes, intelligent, wise and courageous people, who can be trusted, and who look after the common benefit and prosperity, and do not seek their own pleasure, and follow their desires. But how many are rulers and lawyers, even councilors, who think of this? They only make a handling and handicraft out of the authority. Solomon says: A man who can control his mind and break it is better than one who storms and conquers cities 2c. It is a beautiful book, has many fine sayings, Proverbia Salomonis. 

| would like to wish Scipioni, the honest hero, that he were in heaven; he could rule. To be able to overcome oneself and to break and control one's mind is the highest and most praiseworthy victory. Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony 2c., was such a prince: he could digest a lot and control himself, even though he was angry by nature; but he stuck to himself. 


20. that government is a hard thing. 


Doctor Martin Luther said in 1546 about tables in Eisleben: That the wise and prudent man, Frederick of Thuna, knight, had once requested leave from Elector Frederick of Saxony; then the Elector would have said: Dear Thuna, you see that governing is a difficult thing, and | need skilled people for it, | cannot do without you: although your age no longer wants you to be at court, you must nevertheless have patience. Just as | must also be patient. For if | will not do it, and neither will you, who will do it? That is why | cannot let you go. 

(Here 4 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 66, § 53.) 


1226 


Cap. 44. of the authorities and princes. § 20-23. 


1227 





Item, D. Luther said on another occasion: That young rulers thought they wanted to pick up a jerk like a pebble. 


21. servants are commonly masters. 


One says in the proverb: That in the house (said D. M. Luther Anno 1546) is only one servant, the lord. Item: Princes do not like to be lawyers. For if they would like to be, then all heavy trades would come upon them. That is why they have their chancellors and lawyers, who must bear the burden. For everyone likes to cut the boards where they are thinnest, and one does not like to drill through thick boards. That is why our Lord God comes and casts one into a princely position, like a young journeyman in marriage: he also looks at the maiden from the outside, not knowing what will follow. So it is with the rulers, too. It seems as if it were something delicious, but when you look at it, you see what it is. | do not like to rule; it is not in my nature. 

Then M. Philip said: You have Solem. Thereupon spoke D. M. Luther: "I don't ask anything about your astrology, | know my nature well, and | know it. D. Staupitz used to bend this saying in the Song of Solomon in the 8th Cap., V. 12: "My vineyard is before me": God has taken the regiment to Himself, so that not everyone may strut; He says: | will be it alone, | will be king and regent, pastor and priest, husband in the house and wife with children; in sum, | will be it all alone. And that is also right. And it is dear to me that he has taken the reign in all things to himself. For Pastor, Episcopus, Caesar, Rex, Vir et Uxor errant, but he erreth not, and if it had counseled us, we should be proud. Therefore it is said: Quem fortuna nimium fovet, stultum facit, whom fortune holds too well, it beguiles. If one is too happy, it makes a fool of him; for it is impossible that one should not be proud who is well and happy, according to his own pleasure. 

Therefore God must make us pastors, priests, fathers of households, rulers, etc., so that the water may go a little into our mouths and we may learn to swim. He does not do that, 


then it becomes worse. If then it happens that one says, "| wish | had not become a bishop or a preacher," 2c.; item, "| wish | were a householder," 2c.; and then we cringe behind our ears, "That's right. God cannot otherwise control our wisdom, so He gives us to rule; as He commanded St. Peter to rule the goats, as they say in fables. We must have to govern, otherwise we would not know who we are. So Moses also says: Who am I, Lord, that | should carry the children as a wet nurse carries the children? He was anxious enough about his ministry. It is our Lord God's game, so that he will drive away our pride and arrogance. 

(Here 11 lines are omitted-because contained in Cap. 27, § 

23.) 


22) Why princes and lords do not take away all their plots and practices. 


The princes do not pray nowadays when they want to start something, but only say thus: Three times three is nine; this is not missing. Item: Two times seven is fourteen; this calculation does not fall short, so it must surely come out. Thus says our Lord GOD: Who do you take me for? for a number that is not worth anything? | must sit up here in vain. Therefore he reverses the account and makes it all wrong for them. 


23. how the ecclesiastical and secular regiment was ordered to emperor Maximiliani times. 


The Emperor Maximilian was a splendid hero, who had received magnificent gifts from God, and was especially a fine, polite, modest man, so that Prince Frederick of Saxony preferred him to all princes and lords whom he had seen or experienced, and said of him: "He would have been capable of infamy and seriousness. When his imperial majesty was once asked about this present world government, he smiled and said: God has well appointed both regiments: the ecclesiastical one with a drunken shitting monkey, and thus meant Pope Julium; then the secular one with a chamois hunter; because her imperial majesty had great pleasure in chamois hunting.

27. to give tax and tribute to the authorities. 


Doctor Martin Luther said that a farmer in Dobraun once said a fine word that always pleased him, namely, that he would gladly do: If he had two cows, he would willingly give one away so that he would only keep the other with peace. And it is true that if a right captain is there, that one has a Matiaschken 1), there one finds well people who give there willingly tribute, so that a land peace is preserved. 


The love and obedience of the subjects to the authorities is the highest good and treasure. 


Philippus Melanchthon once told Doctor Martin Luthern over the table: that in his youth he had heard that at an imperial diet some princes had praised the gifts and glories of their principality and country. And the Duke of Saxony had said that he had silver mountains in his country, and thus praised his mine, which at that time gave great yield. The Count Palatine, however, had praised his good wines, which grew for him on the Rhine River. As

1231 


When Duke Eberhard of Wirtemberg was asked to say what glory he had in his country, he replied: "| am indeed a poor prince and cannot be compared to either of your beloved, but | also have a great treasure in my principality, so that even if | were to stray and be all alone in the field, | can still sleep safely in the bosom of each of my subjects. | would like to say that his subjects would love him, that he could stay with them and they would do him everything kind and good. They would do him all good and love. And his poor people also took him for the patrem patriae. When the other princes, Saxony and the Palatinate, heard this, they themselves confessed that this was the noblest treasure and good. 


29. that princes should refrain from drunkenness for the sake of arousal. 


Doctor Martin Luther was once a guest of Duke Ernst of Lineburg and Duke Wilhelm of Meklenburg. Duke Ernst, as a Christian, godly and wise prince, complained about the drunken and intemperate life of the courts, since they are drunk day and night, and yet all wanted to be good Christians, and did not control the vice of drunkenness: Doctor Luther said: "Princes and lords should do something about this. Duke Ernst of Lineburg answered: "Yes, Doctor, we will do that, otherwise it would have been a long time coming; Principum intemperantiam esse causam intemperantiae populi. For when the abbot lays out dice, the whole convent plays. Manant exempla regen- tum in vulgus.

6. by Landgrave Ludwig, called the knight. 


Ludwig the Knight, Landgrave of Hesse and Thuringia, was an angry, fierce lord who was imprisoned by the bishop of Halle on the Gibichenstein: there he jumped out of the window, out of the castle into the Saale, down a high rock, swam through the water, and came away on his Klépper

He said that they were sitting there to keep the country clean. He said that they were sitting there to keep the country clean, so that he pursued the robbers from that time on, as his father did, who returned three thousand guilders to someone who had taken them. He destroyed the nearest castle, had the nobles beheaded and said that they were sitting there to keep the land pure. Thus the present landgrave is a man of war, indeed, an Arminius, small in person but mighty in counsel and fortune. 

Item: The landgrave is, according to his age, an excellent, joyful prince, who lets him advise and say, soon gives way to good advice, gives way and follows: and if it is decided, he does not delay long and executes it with diligence; therefore he is also, for the sake of such princely virtue, feared by the adversaries. At that time, D. Martinus also remembered the day at Frankfurt, and said: "It must be hard with a serious paroxysm. 


8. another from the landgrave Philipp zu Hefsen. 


Doctor Luther said of His F. G. that he was a miracle man, who had a special luck and star. If he wanted to fall away from the Gospel, he should obtain from the Emperor and Pope whatever he wanted: but God has so far constantly preserved S. F. G.. The Emperor offered him that he should quietly possess the County of Katzenelnbogen. Item, Duke Georg wanted to make him heir to all his lands and people, and the Emperor would have confirmed, sealed and certified it if he had wanted to fall away from our religion. But he confessed the doctrine of the Gospel, otherwise he could have become the Emperor's and the Pope's dear son. He has a Hessian head and cannot celebrate, he must have something to do: so he does not trust and believe easily. He starts a lot of things, and it goes out to him. It was a great boldness that he wanted to overpower the bishops in 1528. And it was a greater deed that he installed the Duke of Wirtemberg and chased King Ferdinand out of Wirtemberg. | and Dominus Philippus Melanchthon were Called to S. F. G. for this reason against Weimar, and because of his intended war for the sake of 





When we were asked about our concerns and advice, we recanted to the highest authority and used our best rhetoric to do so; we asked the authorities not to upset the doctrine of the Gospel with this war, or to add a stain to our doctrine, or to break and disturb the common peace of the land in the empire. Then the F.F.G. became very red and were angry about it, since otherwise the F.F.G. have a very sincere mind. 

In the Colloquio at Marburg, Anno 1529, S. F. G. walked in low clothing, so that no one would have taken him for the landgrave, and yet he walked with high and great thoughts. He asked Phil. M. for advice in a matter, and said: "Dear M. Philippe, should | also suffer that the Bishop of Mainz expels my Protestant preachers by force? Philippe answered: "If the jurisdiction of the same places belongs to the bishop of Mainz, then E. F. G. cannot defend him. The Landgrave answered: "I will let you advise, but | will not do it. 1) | (said D. Luther) said at that time to his old councilor, the one from Beimelberg: Why don't you defend your lord and his nobility? Then he answered, "Oh, dear doctor, our admonitions are of no avail; what he does, he will not let himself be taken from it. And when he was about to install the Duke of Wirtemberg, His Holiness asked everyone that he would not lead the Hessian land into ruin. Then he said, "Let it go now, | don't want to ruin it for you. He also led it out and paid honestly. He fired four and a half hundred rounds into a castle and won it. 

And when a day was held at Caden in Bohemia by King Ferdinando and other princes, and an answer was to be given to the landgrave from there, Duke George of Saxony said to King Ferdinando: "If he could gather a war party to resist him in two or three days, he would not advise peace; but if this could not be done, then peace should be made in all directions. And

12. a prince's desertion. 


There was talk of the tyranny of von B[raunschweig], which had now been revealed: how he had captured a doctor, 1) the legate of G[oslar], and forged him into a bathhouse, giving him raw meat to eat and water to drink. After that, he would have finally pegged him to the wall. He, said D. Martin Luther, is supposed to be the patron of the church, a bloodthirsty tyrant, and the idolatrous bishops who have secretly gathered a war party against us. Because they know that the German warriors cannot be used against our princes, neither will those in France. O Lord God, grant us peace, who have so far frustrated the plots and counsels of the heathen and the princes. Would to God that we were grateful and did not forget the works of God. For a while you looked through your fingers as if you were asleep and knew nothing about it. But now you judge rightly, as the 121st Psalm, v. 4, says: "Behold, He who preserves Israel does not sleep nor slumber." 


13. from the Duke of Bavaria. 


The princes of Bavaria 2) have always been proud and hopeful and fiercely hostile to the House of Austria, so that Emperor Maximilian said: If one wanted to boil the two bloods, Austria and Bavaria, in one pot, one would jump out. For they grant the emperorship to the Austrian blood, boast that they are also the wood from which emperors are made. So Duke Wilhelm said. 

Under Carolo Magno and Otto, the first emperor, they have always been proud so far, said D. M. Luther. The present emperorship is now up to the fourth member; item, Franconia and Swabia have each retained the emperorship to the fourth member. The German emperors have been excellent heroes, and not such devils and hell-burners as the Roman and the French emperors.

14. by Duke George of Saxony. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 464.) 


H[archduke G[eorg] has written a great decree and wants to take it with him to the Imperial Diet. | wanted the emperor to elect him as pope, | think he would grant the bishops and dompffes. The bishop of Mainz would be forced to let two bishoprics go. He would give them better than Luther, because the papists would suffer me more easily as a reformer than him, and the decrees scold the bishops much more than Luther. 

(The second paragraph forms the conclusion of Cap. 58, § 3, 

where it has been transferred. - The following paragraph in its first half is from the section in Lauterbach, July 27, 1538, p. 101 f., which we let follow here in its entirety; the second half of the paragraph was reworked by Aurifaber from Cap. 20, K10.) 

The Assembly in Leipzig [Conventus Lipsiensis]. - On July 27, Duke George summoned to Leipzig a large assembly of his prelates, bishops, canons, also the nobles and the committee, and the rumor went out quite generally that Duke George would allow the teaching of the Gospel and the [right] order of the Sacrament, because he wanted to remain with the House of Saxony, his brothers and cousins. Luther replied: | do not believe it. The new newspapers are so good, but my opinion is: Since Duke George of the Papists, the Cardinals sees deceitfulness with the Concilium, which he himself wanted to reform by the decree of the Pope, he did not want his Reformation to fall with him. Therefore, he oppresses his canons, bishops and prelates with the harshest laws, because the old Duke George will come back as he was before the preaching of the Gospel, namely a real enemy of the clergy, who miraculously tormented the bishops, canons and elders. He tormented the bishops, canonists and ebbers miraculously, so that Duke Frederick was forced to step in between. Therefore the saying was spread about Duke George that he was an enemy of the clergy because he was of Bohemian blood from Gersick [i.e. George Podiebrad's grandson from Zdena]; therefore they said: He did not drink it, he sucked it, as if they wanted to say: He is by nature and descent an enemy of the clergy. But after the Pre- 


1242 


When it came to the preaching of the gospel, he wanted to burn himself white. Perhaps Duke George will now reappear in his former form, for he is already so oppressive to some of the elders that our Elector must also protect them from him. 1) 

(The following words at Cordatus No. 755.) 

[It is said:] The priests and monks have made Duke G[eorg] full, and they will spit into his bosom as a reward. 

And he complained to M. Luther about his blindness and blasphemy against Christ, and that he had resisted the recognized truth and had sinned against conscience; and he said: "When | was still in the monastery, | would never have believed that such wickedness should be in people. | wept that the world would soon accept the truth | had recognized; but | learn from the bishop of Mainz and H[archduke] G[eorg] what a herb the world is. Because it does not come from them, it is nothing. Well, | cannot be afraid of those who are so crazy in their conscience that, even if they boast the name of the church before the common man, they still think and believe much differently in their heart. They make true the prophecy of those who say: "Depart from us, we do not want your way, and with our necks erect we are proud. Such people we see before our eyes. And he that speaketh and doeth thus contrary to the word of God and his conscience must again be put to shame with his blasphemies, for he sinneth against the Holy Ghost, is presumptuous, hardened, and controverteth the known truth. 

Item: H[Archduke] G[eorg's] committee had written to H. Heinrich, S. F. G. brother, that he required his son, H. Moritz, who was at the court of H. Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, to come to him first, so they wanted to come and show their F. G. H. G[eorg's] will, because H. G. both sons had died that he had no heirs. Thereupon D. M. Luther said: It is a

Common proverb: He who cannot lift a big stone, let him lie. God sees that he cannot lift the stone. For man may presume to lift it, but God has decreed otherwise. Homo proponit, et Deus disponit, that is, contrarium ponit, he does the contradiction. H.G. wanted to dry up others so that they wither, and make his trunk green and blooming: therefore he gave his oldest son, H.Hansen, the landgravial Fraulein, 2) even a beautiful Fraulein, as a husband. And to H[erzog] Friedrich he offered a Mansfeld Fraulein, 3) Count Hans Georgen's sister. But both young lords begot no children with healthy bodies and beautiful wives. That is why D. M. Luther said: "Because he sees that both his sons have died, he will willingly give himself into it, and deliver the land to his brother, and keep a good will of it, because he cannot take his land with him when he dies. 


15 From Duke George's death. 


In 1539, April 17, George died suddenly of the lliaca, having been healthy and cheerful the day before in the women's room. He was buried in Meissen without all papal pomp and ceremonies. Doctor Luther used to say that it was too much that he who had held mass and vigils in such high esteem should not be able to partake of them at his last end. 

That same year, on May 3, envoys of the princes of Pomerania, who had come from the day to Frankfurt, ate with D. Luther at night: they said that Duke G[eorg] had died at the right time, because the tinder and the fuse, from which a great fire might have arisen, would have been extinguished. Yes, said D. M. Luther, all the papists' thoughts, plans and intentions are directed to this end, that they would have let the church perish even before, if only they had destroyed the Lutheran boys (as they call us).

God has broken their rights and destroyed their plots: for he is able to remove the mighty from their seats, and to exalt the lowly, and to scatter the nations, as the Psalm says, those who delight in war. He also knows how to put to shame trust in men and princes, as inthe 146th Psalm, v. 3, 4, which declares that one "should not trust in princes, for they are men who cannot help, for a man's spirit must depart, and he must return to the earth; then all his strivings are lost. So that we may learn to trust God and follow Him. 

And here one sees God's miraculous work, that He can destroy human attempts and practices. For Duke George and his allies had a war against the Lutherans on Pentecost in mind: now God comes and takes him away by death. In his will (said D. Luther) these words are said to have been written: If it could become so good for him, he wanted to give the emperor his land and the treasure, so that he could fight his enemies in the German country with it. That he thus had war in mind and pronounced against us Lutherans, whom he considered to be the emperor's enemies. 


(This paragraph for the most part, up to the word: "Mines," in Lauterbach, Aug. 5, 1538, page 107 f.) 


On August 5, some lawyers from Leipzig were there, who spoke of the assembly of bishops, abbots and prelates, with whom Duke George alone, without all the magistrates, had consulted and had presented the matter in the most secret manner. But the matter stood thus: Duke George wanted to reform the churches that were under his jurisdiction; since he himself was patron, the bishops [however], his protégés (as Doctor Breitenbach is said to have answered), he still wanted to know where the goods were, if he ever needed them. Luther answered: Duke George will make me pious, so that they would more easily choose my reformation than his. It does them no harm that they, who did not respect the counsel of God and trusted in men, namely in the Emperor and Duke George, are now put to shame. For the council 


Cap. 45: Of kings, princes and lords. § 15. 


1245 


The suggestions of the Holy Spirit are firm; whoever does not want to believe them must experience them. Even if Duke George praises the canons of the Decretals, but if he also judged the bishops and prelates according to them, he would not be free to break into the church properties, and he would not be a patron of them, but a lowly protégé. But the jurists say that the rights are to be distinguished according to time. So does Duke George, seeking the fifth corner, seeking privilege, since our Elector has equal rights with him in ecclesiastical matters, as well as in the regalia and mines. - But there is no hope that he will cease his raging before the sea dries up. If | had first written for the pope, he would have been against the pope; but because | write against the pope, he fights for him and defends him, for he considers it his greatest wisdom to stand against others and resist them. He may not call our doctrine heresy, but he calls it a novelty. 

When H. G. died and the sudden change of the principality took place, D. M. Luther said. M. Luther: "It is a punishment for those who despise the right, true God. Here one sees and grasps how foolish the wisdom of the flesh and of reason is, in those who rely on an old man and poor cripple, because he has now walked daily in the pit. If only he had been as powerful as King Pharaoh was in his kingdom of Egypt, whom the Holy Scriptures, Isa. 36:6, call a reed that breaks when you lean on it, and pierces or pierces your hands. Therefore he who trusts 1) and relies on the help of men must be deceived and disgraced. 

George was once very ill, said M. Luther, when his physician D. P. came to him. P. had come to him; a crucifix had been presented to the prince, which he should look at; then he had lifted up and said: "Take that thing away, it makes the gentleman melancholy.

1246 Cap. 45: Of kings, princes and lords. § 16. 17. 1247 


16. by Duke Henry of Saxony. 


Doctor M. Luther said that H. G. was an example that should be considered in this last time of the world, since a father with two beautiful, adult and great sons would have gone down in a short time. For when he was vehemently hostile to the teachings of the Gospel, and publicly wrote against him, D. Luther, and also drove many of his subjects from Leipzig and Oschatz and elsewhere into exile and expelled them, and divided his brother, H. Heinrich, nourishingly and poorly with the office of Freiberg and Wolkenstein, and only added thirteen thousand florins to it in the year, which was obtained through Prince Frederick's and H. Hansen's negotiations in Saxony. Luther had prophesied to him that George and his tribe would perish, and said: God will turn the tide, and wither the heir, and let the withered grow by his blessing. For Anno 1537 Duke George's eldest son, Duke Hans, had died. In 1539, his other son, Duke Frederick (to whom he gave a wife, a Countess of Mansseld, whom he had only four weeks, and assigned 24 councilors to him as guardians, for the regiment), also died on the 24th day of Februarii. In the same 1539th year, on the 17th day of April, the father, Duke George, followed and also departed with death, and was buried without all papal ceremonies. 

On the other hand, Henry and his sons inherited the Meissen land, which he would have liked to get rid of, and kept him like a Cinderella. For he sent him to the Holy Land, thinking that he should remain outside in the same pilgrimage. After that he sent him to war in Friesland, where he was besieged and captured, and was in great danger of his life. After that he took a vow from him that he should not take a wife. Item, he did not grant the brother a piece of the regalia, so that he also did not suffer him on the coin. 1) Lastly, when his son, H. Fried- 


1) This means that he did not have his image, as a co-regent, minted on the coins. 


rich had died to him, he wanted to turn the principality over to the emperor and even disinherit his brother H. Heinrich. But it did not help, Duke George had to wither away, even though he had fathered nine children with his wife, the Queen of Poland, as Johannem, Friedericum, Magdalenam, Chnstianam, Christophorum, Annam, Agnetam, Margaretham, and another Christophorum. Nevertheless, the children all died before him except for one daughter, and he followed after, and is now the same as if he had never been in the world. 

M. Luther also said, when H. Heinrich had received the homage in Leipzig in 1539 and he, D. Martinus, preached there on the day of Pentecost, and later with the Elector of Saxony, Duke Johann Friedrich, and H. Heinrich, on the 26th day of May, drove out of a wagon at the same time from Leipzig to Grimm, that at that time H. Heinrich had complained a lot on the wagon about H. Georg, his brother. Georg, his brother, and said that he had had no greater enemy in his life than his own brother, for he had wanted him dead, and that in the same 39th year he had also written out to him the yearly money, the 13,000 florins, 2) and had absolved the four towns, as Pirn, Hain, WeiBenfels and lEckersberg, which had been assigned to the pledge for it, and punished those of WeiBenfels with imprisonment, that they had kept their guarantee according to the prescription. God was still able to miraculously raise up and make great H. Heinrich, and on the other hand let H. Georg's tribe perish with the root. 

(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 532,) 

Duke Henry of Saxony once mockingly said to his brother, Duke George: "Brother, the world is getting strange; but | will stay with the Latin mass, since one can buy one for a penny, because the German mass costs ten villages.

In so many imperial congresses we do not counsel peace, but rather strife and war; yes, well then, in the name of their God, who drives them in their fierce anger, poems, deeds, 1) counsel, practices and proposals, we will always let them go and perish. 


18. pious princes poor people. 


Princes and lords are poor people, especially if they are pious and God-fearing; therefore our Lord God did not command in vain to honor the authorities and to pray for them. 

D. M. Luther once said: There are not poorer people on earth than the princes; and our Lord God has not commanded it so diligently through Paulum in vain: Orate pro illis, qui in sublimitatious constituti sunt. | have not understood it so well, the orare, as in my two Electors and Lords, H[erzog] Johann and H[erzog] Johann Friedrich. They are out of the saddle, they cannot help, even if they would like to; therefore they need the prayer of the Christians. 


19. princes dying. 


On July 22, 1533, M. Luther said over the table to Duke John Frederick, Elector of Saxony 2c.: It is a miserable thing when a prince dies, as when a peasant dies, he has no standing. A prince must be abandoned by all his friends and lords, and in the end must fight with the devil; one does not want to think of living a little more princely.

The Franconian nobility has been punished, but if | see our nobility and the Meissen nobility punished, it will be bad.

22. From King Alphonso, how great lords should love their subjects. 


When King Alphonsus of Arragon had besieged the city of Cajeta 2) and a poor defenseless group of women, children and weak people were driven out of the city, so that the others inside could wait out the siege the longer and fight back, the captains advised the king that he should make an incursion and strike the same group, so that those in the city would be induced to surrender the sooner. Then Alphonsus said: "God protect me for this, | did not want to take the whole kingdom of Neapolis and practice such tyranny and despotism: it is not so dear to me, even if it were still so delicious and good. And Duke Frederick, the laudable Elector of Saxony, is also said to have said the same thing, when some advised him to invade and besiege Erfurt; it would not cost more than five men, and they would perish. But he did not want to do it and said: "It would be too much for one man. But nowadays, great lords do not pay much attention to their subjects, just as they do not pay much attention to the men of war. As he said, "The mother of all the soldiers has not yet died. Item: A lot of soldiers are raised with a ton of buttermilk. 


Why our suggestions and advices are not correct, especially those of the regents. 


There is nothing praiseworthy and lovely about a prince, except that he speaks freely what his opinion is, and loves those who do the same, saying unashamedly what is in their hearts, where time and necessity require it. There is nothing more shameful in a preacher than to keep his mouth shut and not speak freely what he has in mind and what his opinion is, especially when he is supposed to speak for half an office. God makes fools of both princes and theologians, for he commands them to rule and imposes on them things that are impossible, which no one would take upon himself if he knew it in the first place; and yet he may not refrain from doing so with a clear conscience once he has been commanded to do so and has accepted it. But it is toil and trouble that we are commanded to do much, and yet little is done; it will go nowhere. 


2) D. i. Ga "ta in Neapolitan.

Cap. 45: Of kings, princes and lords. Princes and lords. § 23-27. 


1251 





This is what our Lord God does, so that he alone may be wise and mighty, and may keep the honor. For if it were according to our words and our plans, as we have thought and done, we would be proud and presumptuous, as if we were so wise, and were the people who could do it. For it is inborn in us by nature that we strive and stand for great wisdom, power and honor, want to accomplish much and make everything delicious. 

Well, says God, you are the man who can and does; go, be wise, and do it well; be a preacher and make the people pious; be a lord and ruler and bring the people well 2c. So then go quickly; yes, the crab walk; and the end of the song is called: It is all quite vain. Only God should be given wisdom and honor, we are fools and miserable bumblers with our doings and art. 


24. from the roman empire. (Contained in Cap. 76, § 27.) 


25. by Duke Wilhelm zu S. (Lauterbach, Nov. 23, 1538, p. 178.) 


After that, it was said of Duke Wilhelm of Saxony, who, when he married Anna, the daughter of the King of Hungary, despised her very much and had her imprisoned, because he had with him a very beautiful woman, Catharina von Brandenstein, with whom he went to bed in public, so that the queen saw it. Finally, the queen died of heartache, and he went to the holy land and did enough for his sin. He took the whore as his wife. When one of the court ducks was supposed to imitate him in marrying his concubine, he quickly took another virgin and married her. But Duke Wilhelm, although he was an excellent, well- mannered prince, nevertheless had to pay in the end, as the Psalm (58:12) says: "God is still judge on earth. 


26. young gentlemen. (Cordatus No. 1429.) 


Young gentlemen must have good days until their twentieth year, so that they do not become fainthearted. After that, God comforts them. 


When they come into office, their good days are spoiled. An example of this is a tree that is planted in a pot, which is still nurtured and cared for in the open field, but when it grows up [out of the earth], how much it has to suffer! 1) 


27. princes must be the scribes and captains servants. 


A prince rules in peace among the scribes, in war he must be servant and servant among the soldiers and thrasons; for he must tolerate and suffer the willfulness, courtiers and tyranny of every captain, colonel and warrior, and must not rebel against them. He has as many masters as he has captains and men-of-war, to whom he must not only give enough, even superfluous, but also give thanks, worship them, carry them on his hands, greet them kindly and be a good companion with them, lying below and above; otherwise he is despised and abandoned. 

This is true, especially in our time, when there is neither discipline nor restraint among such people. But if he takes a snatch, that he is exhausted, and has no more money, or is killed, then they go to another, and leave him, yes, let themselves be used against him in wars, and help to overrun him, whom they previously supported and defended. Summa Summarum, he alone bears the title, a servant of the servants of the devil: if he is not also a Christian and prays, he becomes the poorest and most miserable man, of whom one has mercy. 

But a prince must have such people, and it is impossible that everything could go right as it should. But even so, this is the most pious prince, who does not want it gladly, nor does he consent to it, but only suffers such companions, yes, must suffer them well, and punishes what he knows and can, so that everything does not go freely unpunished and unbridled, but that one must nevertheless be afraid of the sword. At court, everyone begrudges the other his happiness, and would like to be the first on the board and soar upward. 


1) Aurifaber in a marginal gloss places this speech wrongly in the year 1545. No speech, which is handed down by Cordatus, falls later than 1537. 


1252 


28. princes work the greatest and most dangerous. (Cordatus No. 586. 587.) 


If the peasants knew the very great things and difficult cases that the princes have to deal with, they would thank God for their good and quiet position. But they, like sheep and oxen, see only the splendor and the palaces of the same, but they do not see the sorrows. Therefore, they dishonor God, are safe and snore in peace, and harm the people by despising the authorities. 

Duke Frederick told the preceptor at Lichtenberg [Wolfgang ReiBenbusch] step by step and in order that the life of the peasants was the happiest of all civic positions, the burghers bought with great concern and sold at a loss, the nobles had their complaints, but the princes had the greatest worries. The peasants, however, as everything would grow by itself, sell everything they can in the most expensive way, and only to them he gave the highest price [palmam] of happiness. That they give tithes and annual interest, they give for the land and the soil that belongs to the princes. Therefore, let it be true with respect to them what is said: The better the land, the poorer the people. 


29th farmers work. (Cordatus No. 588.589.) 


The peasants who complain about the arduousness of their labors are lying, for all their labors are very cheerful, if only for the sake of this one cause, that they are full of the best hope, planting, tilling the field, hewing wood and everything else. Suffer not much in food, as the citizens do. Yes, a correct interpreter of the life of the same is Virgil in the Georgicis: O the all too happy peasants 1) 2c. 

The peasants do not realize their [happy] lot, therefore God strikes them with this evil, that their servants and maids have it better than the masters themselves, because they do not care about the domestic worries and do the same.

not feel, but only their work. My wolf has it better than me and my Kathe. For marriage brings discomfort with it and imposes it especially on the man. In short, the higher the status, the greater the danger. Optat ephippia bos piger; optat arare caballus, 2) No one is satisfied with his fate. 


30 Of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Electorate of Saxony. (Cordatus No. 1455.) 


The Bohemians have in the castle at Prague the paintings of all the kings who have reigned so far, and they have a prophecy that when this line of kings is full, they will have no more king. And Ferdinand occupies the last space, so we may expect that evil augury. Also the row of the dukes of Saxony became full with Frederick [the Wise], who stood, so that there was no more room, at the door to Wittenberg [in the castle], and he [Luther] said, this means something: The cuckoo in the Bohemian Forest shall not sing here. 3) 


31. by Emperor Carl the Fifth. 


At the Diet of Worms, Anno 1521, Emperor Carl the Fifth had a swift mandate against my doctrine, Luther's doctrine, issued and posted; on it some learned, faithful men wrote soon in front, after the first line, near his coat of arms on the margin, namely these words: "Some have still had good hope in this Emperor Carl; but how much this tyrannical edict has scared off and turned away the hearts of many pious, honest people from him, that cannot be thought, much less said. 


32. from the Emperor Maximilian. 


Emperor Maximilian is said to have said at a time when he had established an alliance with the Venetians: There would have been three kings in

3) That means: The prophecy of misfortune, which fits Bohemia, does not apply here, because the second Elector after Frederick already ruled. 


1254 


He, the emperor, the king of France, and the king of England. He would be a king of kings, because if he interpreted something to his princes, if it pleased them, they would do it, if not, they would leave it. This indicates that the princes would never have obeyed him, but would have done as they wished. The king of France, however, would be a king of asses; for everything that he called his own, they would have to do, like asses, his princes would have to obey. But the king of England would be a king of the people, for what he laid out for them they would gladly do, and would love their lord as obedient subjects. 


33. mildness of the emperor Maximilian. 


The emperor Maximilianus had an amusing man with him, who pulled off many merry pranks, called Kunz von der Rosen. 1) He once walked behind 2) a poor priest and saw that he was carrying a book under his arm: such a book pleased the fool, so he took it from the priest. But when the priest wanted to have his book back, Kunz von der Rosen said, "Come with me, | will pay you enough for the book. When the priest went with him, the fool led the priest into the emperor's parlor. The emperor asked what the man wanted. Kunz von der Rosen answered: "Dear emperor, it is a poor priest, he has left his prayer book in the public house: now he asks for a tax so that he can get his book back. The emperor, however, soon understood Kunz von der Rosen's antics and said: "Oh, what a strange man you are! and ordered ten guilders to be given to the poor priest for worship. 


34. of King Solomon's court and order. (Lauterbach, Aug. 26, 1538, p. 121.) 

On August 26, Luther said: "Solomon's kingdom was very well ordered; there was also a definite order of expenses, so that he also knew how much was consumed daily by the 


1) Cf. Cap. 63, §11. 2) In the issues: before. 


Cap. 45: Of kings, princes and lords. § 32-36. 


1255 


all the land in the twenty-four courts, as it is described 1 Kings 4:22: "And Solomon had to have daily for food thirty cores of fine flour, and sixty cores of other flour; ten fatted oxen, and twenty pastured oxen 2c. So all his land was laid up." For those costs do not extend to Solomoni's farm, but to the whole territory. | consider that nowunder four imperial cities consume daily more in so large expenditure. 


Why does God punish the subjects because of the Lord's sin? 


D. M. Luther was asked: Why God had punished the people, since David had sinned? To this he gave this answer, saying: Israel was not pure either, as the text indicates; therefore, when God wants to punish a people, He removes the hand, so the king falls, hence the punishment follows primarily because of the people's disobedience. 


Whether it is better to govern by reason and natural understanding, or by and according to the rights and laws described. 

(Cordatus No. 780. 781. 782.) 


The natural dialectic we draw from what we have seen and experienced, but the artificial one is learned from rules, and it is better governed by the mind than by laws of art. For the intellect is the soul of the law and the master of all laws. But where are those who have such an understanding? In one century there is hardly one. 

Our Prince Frederick governed everything by reason and counsel, and since his brother John was prescribed such, he still could not attain his wisdom. Fabian Feilitzsch is said to have given more reliable answers from reason alone than any jurist. Philipp Melanchthon teaches those glorious arts, but the arts did not teach him. And | put my art into the books and do not take it from the books. One must learn from learned and clever people, but to reach them, one will leave, and theirs are not many. If our prince wanted to have such intelligence as Frederick had, he will not. 


1256 


The laws belong to the people, the mind is with individuals. Therefore, those are governed and those govern by the laws. And because those who are truly wise by reason are lacking, one must use the laws that wise people have made with their reason. 


37. of the political and church anger. 


Domestic wrath, as father and mother, masters and wives in the house, does no great harm; but the wrath of the authorities, both in spiritual and temporal government, does real harm. For there perish woman, child, country, people, angels, God, and all welfare, even as now, when the wicked are angry with us. Domestic anger is like children playing with dolls. 


38. by Christiern, King of Denmark. 


D. M. Luther had a tablet on which was painted how King Christian of Denmark was expelled. He looked at this painting for a long time and finally said: "Although it is a disgrace to the king, | will gladly have it. For itis an example and teaches that God does not want to suffer pride or presumption, but overthrow; as Mary sings in the Magnificat: "He removes the mighty from the throne,” Luc. 1, 52. 


39. of driving out King christian. 


D. M. Luther was asked whether he, the King of Denmark, had also been expelled in a lawful manner. Whether it had been right for him? He said, "They say he was a tyrant; but he did not rage as the bishops cry out against him. He was expelled more from the hatred of the bishops than from just causes. Therefore, because he now hears that the bishops lie imprisoned, he is said to have clasped his hands together, lifted them up and said: Praise be to God that | see that my adversaries have been put to shame; now | will gladly endure and suffer my imprisonment. Thus fornication has done great harm to the good Lord; for fornication corrupts and devastates the land and the people, and nothing good comes of it. 


Cap. 45. of kings, princes and lords. § 36-42. 


1257 


40 The Emperor Maximiliani Courtesy. 


When the King of Denmark at one time sent a noble legation and embassy to Emperor Maximilian, and the same assumed great honor for itself on account of its lord being powerful, so that the envoy wanted to do the advertisement and the request sitting down: when Emperor Maximilian noticed this, he stood up and heard him standing, so that the legate also had to stand up half ashamed and do his advertisement. 

Likewise, when an envoy, in the beginning of his speech and proposal, was frightened and dismayed, so that he kept silent and, as it were, fell silent, the emperor began to talk to him about another deal, giving him time to consider, until he encouraged himself again. 

Item, when an insolent beggar asked him, the emperor, for a gift, and called him brother, because they were both of one father Adam origin: he was poor, but the emperor rich, who could help; he said to him, Behold, thou hast two kreuzer, and go to the other brothers also; if they give thee so much, thou art richer than | am. 


41. courtesy and kindness of the Emperor Maximiliani the First. 


(Cordatus No. 1603.) 


Maximilian had an unfaithful counselor, who also did him much evil in other ways, and yet he wanted to be just. Once the emperor approached him and said: "What do you think he deserves who is my most trusted advisor and yet unfaithful? He answered without delay: He would be worthy of the most ignominious death. Then he struck him on the armpit and said: | must have yours more. If my duke said such things to me, | would shit in my pants. 


42. another history. 


Otherwise D. M. Luther had told a story about the Emperor Maximiliano, that he once sat and calculated and had a large pile of money in front of him on the table. One of his advisors had stood in front of him, had always looked him in the eye, and had seen whether the emperor wanted to look around or go away, so that he could reach into the money. 





1258 Cap. 45: Of kings, princes and lords. § 42-44. 1259 


would have done. Now, the emperor notices it, and leans against the wall as if he were tired, closes his eyes and falls asleep: soon he is there, and reaches for the florins, wipes his pocket with them. The emperor is silent, and when he finally wakes up, he is standing there just as before. Then the emperor says, "My dear, | see that this money is very pleasing to you; let me see it, take it, and what you take is yours. He does so, and the emperor says, "My dear, let me see and count how much you have been able to collect at once. He counts it. Then the emperor said, "My dear, count the others that you have in your pocket. Then he had to take out what he had first taken and count it, but the emperor left him both. 


44, from king Heinzen divorce. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 795.) 


The wife of the King of England, the sister of the other of our Emperor, was united to him in a orbidden degree, but the Pope, with cunning advice, eferred the divorce from himself to the universities, nd seven had decided that the divorce should be ronounced publicly. We, however, and the University f Louvain have given a different opinion. The others unningly seek the Emperor's disgrace by pushing ack his aunt, so that they would do a favor to the King f France, whose sister they want to join to the nglishman.

M. Franz Burkart, after he came back from England, rode next to M. Luther's carriage and said how zealous and angry the king was against the pope, that he soon asked him in the first address: whether it was true that the princes and theologians in Germany were divided and ambivalent in religious matters against the pope, as he had heard from truthful and credible people. Then he, M. Franz, had constantly confuted and refuted it, saying that it was impudently fabricated with untruth, and that since the royal dignity knew that it was otherwise, he wanted to be his eternal prisoner together with his fellow envoys and companions. So that he would have confirmed and strengthened the king very much, so that he would have given him free access to him at all times afterwards, and would have talked to him a lot about the Christian Augsburg Confession. 

Then D. Jonas said, as Elector John of Saxony 2c. said to his theologians at Augsburg in 1530: "Dear sirs, if you do not dare to preserve it, think that you do not lead the country and its people into harm. But the theologians pete have, answered If yous Peraedorvel unt of Emperor Carl V, had first been married to the brother of want to stand with us, then let us come alone before enry VIIl of England, Arthur.

Barnes (in Wittenberg nder the name of Antonius) had been seconded, spoke in favor f the validity of the marriage. The King of France is said to have ontributed a great deal to the consummation of the divorce, so hat he turned the King of England away from the friendship of the mperor altogether. Henry repudiated Catharina in July 1531, and he formal divorce was not pronounced until 1533 by Thomas ranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, after Henry had already (1533) married Anna Boleyn. Cf. Luther's concerns about this marriage matter. Walch, old edition, vol. XVII, 266 (Rebenstock 1, 235 k.) and vol. XXI, 1386, the latter dated Sept. 5, 1531 (Wrampelmeyer.). 2) In the editions: Traitors.

The king took good care of the Cardinal Marcionem 1) and saw him as a traitor, and immediately occupied and fortified all ports and approaches to England in the best and strongest way, so that on Easter Day all cities were in cuirasses and went to the sacrament. There spoke D. M. Luther said: "There will be no end to it; the pope will remember and practice day and night to humiliate this king, just as he does us Germans. 


The first of these is the "Theological". 


There was talk about the secret practices of the papists, which they lead against us through the French and the emperor 2c. Then said D. M. Luther said: "It behooves such high majesties to fight honestly and truthfully, not secretly. Oh, if the high majesties are such assassins, who want to defend this bear wolf, who is dealing with deceit, secretly, without announcement of war, then they will have no more luck, because they are assassins. The prayer of devout God-fearing Christians has been our protection and wall against them, so that their treachery and practices have been revealed and come to light. | certainly believe that God has so far protected me against their counsels and plots, as He delivered Jacob the patriarch from the Scythians, Genesis 35. 

When it was said by some who had received writings from England, how the king had once again fallen away from the Gospel, had commanded, under corporal punishment, that the laity should take the Sacrament only under one form, that clerics, monks and nuns should keep their vows, and that their and the priests' marriages should be torn apart; since he had previously done the opposite in all this, but now he did otherwise, to God's displeasure and to the pope's pleasure; said D. M. Luther. M. Luther: "The papists will laugh at this, rejoice and boast, as it is also a great annoyance; but let it go, that it may go as it will, itis the same King Heinz, as | have depicted him in the first booklet, he will well find his judge: his predecessor, the priest, the priests, the priests, and the priests.

| never liked the fact that he wanted to kill the body of the pope but preserve the soul, that is, his false teaching. 

Item, Anno 1539, den 10. Julii, D. M. Luther thanked God that he had redeemed our church from this annoying king of England, who had desired and sought our alliance with the greatest diligence, and yet had not been accepted; no doubt that God had prevented this out of special counsel, for he has always been unstable and fickle. 

| am glad that we are rid of the blasphemer. He wants to be the head of the church in England without means after Christ, which title is not due to any bishop, no matter how pious and godly he may be, let alone to a king or prince. It does not suffer, Christ alone is the only bridegroom and head of his Christian church. The church is not such a small body as the pope dreams. But the devil rides this king to vex and martyr Christ. He killed Thomas Morum, who had offended against God and sinned, even though he had done nothing against the king. He remains King Heinz, but he will soon be put to shame. | am sorry and repentant that M. Philipp Melanchthon has written the most beautiful presations and prefaces to the most wicked people. 


46 The King of England's Divorce. (Lauterbach, May 29, 1538, p. 88.) 


On May 29, Luther spoke about the marriage case of the King of England. When he had married his brother's wife, who was the mother-sister of the emperor, he had not been allowed to do so by the pope; but since he wanted a judicial verdict from the pope, since he was ready to keep her or to leave her, a court day was set for him in England. When Cardinal Campegius arrived there and heard both sides, he left secretly without deciding the matter. The enraged king then sought the decision of many universities, which decided the separation, because it was an evil thing.

1263 





The first of these is the question of whether Thomas Morus was killed for the sake of the Gospel. (Lauterbach, May 29, 1538, p. 88.) 


Luther was asked if Thomas More had been killed by the king for the sake of the Gospel. Not at all, he said, for he was a very great tyrant against the gospel and shed much blood of pious confessors, whom he tortured with strange tools like an executioner. First he examined them with words under a green tree, then he tortured them with questions in prisons, finally, since he was the closest to the king and behaved wantonly against the decree of the whole kingdom, he himself fell under punishment. 


48. prophecy of the emperor Carl. (Cordatus No. 641 and 1587.) 


In an old book one read that Emperor Carl would subjugate all of Europe, he would reform the church and under him the mendicant orders would fall, and the western beast and the eastern lion would subjugate the whole world. This is what | understand from the Turk and Carl.

49. unequal happiness of two brothers, great potentates. (Cordatus No. 833. 868. 869. 923. 986. 987.) It is wonderful that two brothers have such different fortunes, like Ferdinand and the Emperor. Everyone shouts: Away from Ferdinand

and the emperor! The advice of the former is lost in the wind, but the advice of the latter is happy, because he is innocent and has not stained himself with blood. 2) The former lives and does according to Aristotle's choice. The former lives and does according to the choice of Aristotle, but the latter is governed by the counsel of God. The latter has imposed himself and relies on his wisdom, [but God says]: they have chosen whom | did not want, and | will disgrace their choice. Therefore, he is led there by his will, not by divine impulse. 

When | pray that God may give victory to Carl against the Turk, our sins and ingratitude cry out to me against it. 

The Pope called Carl to Germany that he should corrupt us, and behold, GOD has preserved us and corrupted the Pope. He has an imperial modesty, does not throb, and GOD gives happiness to his enterprise. "To govern is to see through the fingers." He who cannot see through his fingers cannot govern. 

God gives everything to His own in sleep [Ps. 127, 2]. You can see that in Carl. He must have a good angel. By the way, Ferdinand does everything with wisdom, but everything is lost to him, even what he already has in his hands. 

God is doing wonders at this time of ours with the two brothers Carl and Ferdinand, because he has given each of them a great dominion, and yet formed them with the most different inclinations and manners. The former is the author of war, the latter of peace. Happiness dwells with the one, misfortune with the other; everyone loves the one, everyone hates the one. 4) Ferdinand has neither money nor favor; wealth and favor flow to him.

In 1544, shortly before the French War, when Emperor Carl the Fifth was passing through France and staying in several towns, the King of France gave him a grand banquet in a castle and had a very beautiful virgin from the nobility brought to his chamber in the evening and secretly put to bed. But when the emperor lay down and knew nothing about it, the maiden was so frightened that she trembled. . Then the emperor summoned his advisors and asked 50. emperor kisses the pope's feet. diligently: Where she was from and what parents she 

(Cordatus No. 1237.) had. And when the maiden had reported and narrated the whole affair in a fine, simple and chaste manner, the emperor sent her home to her parents unharmed and unchanged with gifts and presents, just as she had come to him, and gave her several horsemen to escort her. She, however, the virgin, thanked the emperor beforehand with weeping eyes quite humbly and humbly. When the escorts and horsemen returned, the emperor departed. But not long after that, he had the same castle razed to the ground 51. from France and England. during the war. 


The kings of France and England have fallen away from the pope, and the emperor has kissed his feet again. 1) The [pope] understands the will of the emperor very well, because if the emperor kisses his feet, the pope must lick the emperor again in Ars. But those two kings are Lutheran in taking, not in giving. 2) They seek what is theirs, not what is God's.

If the spiritual princes, the bishops, were temporal lords, it would be much better and more advisable.

God sustains him wonderfully. 


61. from N. N. Government. 


In 1539, June 4, there was talk of a great lord who was raging against the gospel and was planning strange plots. M. Luther said: "He is a poor gentleman, who is a prisoner of the pope and thinks that one could not fight the Turk, if one had first eradicated Christ and his gospel. He is like King Ahaz, who, when he wanted to defeat Assyria, called on the God of the Syrians and Damascus, and the God of Israel was no good at all. And | am surprised that the papists are so bold and cheerful, yes, mad and foolish, and are allowed to execute and execute the sentence, which has not yet been pronounced nor fallen. But, praise God, we still have the advantage that no council has condemned us for heretics. Thus the right define and describe, and say: That he is a heretic who stubbornly defends his error 2c. Which we have never done in our part, but freely displayed testimonies from God's Word and the Holy Scriptures, and gladly listen to the other opinion. But here is effort and work, that we do not have the pope as a judge nor can suffer, but want to make him a part. 


62. same mandate. 


Doctor Martin Luther was given a printed mandate by a king, in which he seriously forbade that no one should adopt the new doctrine of Luther, which would be the mother and root of all evil. 2c. Then he said: This shall be the reward of this world, namely.

(The following paragraph Cordatus No. 1144.) 


Ferdinand does not suffer misfortunes of a hero, which kings are wont to suffer, as Louis drowned in the water in the war, the king of France caught in the war. He suffers only peasant misfortunes. For at Augsburg he almost fell to his death; in Bohemia he almost perished in the fire; since he went over the ice on the Danube, he almost brought himself to his death. | believe that the cause of all these misfortunes is his own arrogance, in which he does everything. He has a godless heart and grieves over nothing and regrets nothing, unless he is like Esau, who did not grieve because he had offended God with his trade, but over the loss of his birthright. God is not concerned about this. 


63: The Turkish invasion. 


Let us do righteous penance, pray, and wait for the will of the Lord, for human help and protection is too weak for this. Five years ago (1532 in September), the emperor could have resisted the Turks, since he had gathered a very powerful army on horseback and on foot, from all over the empire, both French and Germans, but he did not want to. Unfortunately, many good people were sacrificed on the flesh bank and perished miserably. Oh dear God, what is more in this life than dying and death! Nothing more than death from youth to old age. 

The extreme wickedness of the world, said D. M. Luther, will provoke God to anger, so that he will punish...

His Electoral Grace once said: "| see and experience that the property of princes is not that of those who deserve it and to whom it should be given cheaply, but to whom it is bestowed. Emperor Sigmund also said the same thing. For once he was riding through water and his horse (to speak with 


great lords, kings and princes are poor captives. A leave) stumbled in the water, and a servant started 


and said: "This horse has the nature and character of its master, the emperor, because it stumbles in the water, since there is water enough before; so the emperor also gives a blessing and a gift to those who are rich enough before. When the emperor heard this, he answered: Great lords' goods and gifts are not for those who deserve them, but for those to whom they are given; and that this is true, you shall know it as soon as we come into our court camp. As the imperial majesty dismounted from his horse in the castle, he ordered that two wooden boxes be prepared for him, one full of gold and the other full of lead of the same weight. He summoned the same old servant, who had complained in the water that his master did not give him anything, and set the two boxes before him, saying, "One is full of gold, the other full of lead; now take whichever one you want, and it shall be yours. 


1The servant felt and tested both cans, and because 


they were of equal weight, he grabbed them and caught the one that was filled with lead. Then the emperor said, "You see that it is not my fault that you do not get anything from me. 

Luther also said of Prince Frederick that he collected with bushels and spent with spoons; that is, he would have been exact and frugal, and would have kept house. But now the opposite is happening at the courts.

75 From Duke John, Elector of Saxony. (Cordatus No. 855.) 


When the Elector of Saxony [John] was hunting for the last time, no game wanted to come in or wait. Thereupon he_ said: Well, that should mean something, that our little animals thus flee against their habit. The virtue of this prince was great and he despised the threats of all his enemies. 


76 Of the death of Duke John. 


Alas, said D. M. Luther, when he saw Duke Hansen, Elector of Saxony 2c. die, how a great prince dies there so lonely, that not a son, cousin or friend has been with him, when he passed away! The physicians say: the spasm (cramp) has strangled him. Just as children are born without care, live without care, and die without care: so our dear prince, Duke Johannsen, will feel on the last day as if he came from the Lochish heath from the hunt, will not know what will happen to him; as Isaiah says Cap. 57, 1. 2.: "The righteous is carried away, and lies down in his chamber and in his bed of rest. 


The first of these is a book by Duke John Frederick, Elector of Saxony. 


Since Duke Johann Friedrich, the Elector, was remembered, who had been well plucked and plucked by the nobility and sequestrators for five years, would have had to pay an apprenticeship; D. M. Luther said: His father would have diligently warned him. M. Luther: His father had warned him diligently, he wanted to be careful and diligently guard himself, so that he would not be given to such birds and little snapping chickens nor come into the hands; and he said: Elector Hans had said to me, D. M. Luther, in Torgau in the chamber: My son does not know the people yet, but he will learn to know them. As if he wanted to say: | have learned it from experience; but because princes and lords without the help of the nobility do not know the people. 


If they can rule alone, they must suffer something from them and not want to have everything so straightforwardly, especially what is not contrary to God and the conscience. A bad 1) householder without servants cannot rule his house alone, much less can a prince or king rule his principality or kingdom alone. Emperor Carl had eight chancellors at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530. 

D. Gregorius Brick told me, said D. M. Luther: He had not seen a man who could forgive so heartily as H[erzog] Johann, Elector of Saxony. 


78. from duke Johann Friedrichs, Churfiirsten, sincerity and constancy?) 

(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Oct. 7, 1538, p. 

144.) 

He praised the sincerity and constancy of the Elector, who hated lies exceedingly and yet until now had seen through his fingers in his office. | hope that he will now wake up. As it happened to the Elector Frederick when he was young and very poor at first. Since he then looked at the registers and order himself, he became very rich and was not allowed to borrow from the treasurers. 

Duke Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, is angry by nature, but he can break his anger and sense, that it is a miracle; is Germany's salvation, a God-fearing and understanding prince, he has his five senses, God keep him for a long time, amen. 

Our Lord God has thus wrought the game through our present prince, that it has never been so hard as with him, because he has the reign, although all men comforted him evil. But the emperor's heart is in God's hand. 

If my most gracious young lord comes into the regiment, then scribes, chancellors, scholars will count for nothing, Junker Scharrhans will be all and practice tyranny: since the good lord thinks much differently, it will go well. But such assumed ignorance will overthrow him. God make it well, the lice are even in the

He praised the sense of the Elector that he would be inclined to promote the studies. That is why he also came here to confirm the reformation of the university and the lecturers, so that they would give their lectures more often and with greater care. | also let myself think that he has rightly told J. S[chenk] the chapter, because he is already humiliated, although he does not yet want to appear as if he has done wrong, but wants to be disgraced with witnesses. Let us pray for our Elector that he will preserve the church and the studies. For this small little university is, as it were, the foundation of pure religion, that it may be preserved with lectures and scholarships against the ravages of the devil. And he said of Alexander the Great, who already established war scholarships for the infants, because he wanted to preserve the monarchy; after that he soon had them taught as youngsters by competitors and pugilists, so that he would then have soldiers and men of war. This is what our Elector will do, God willing. He sees well that he is not entrusted with the nobility. For it is said that the sequestrators have spent seven thousand florins in five years. He now wants to be a sequestrator himself, will now make out. May God grant him a long life. Amen.

It is said: Opportunity must be grasped by the scoop, behind it is bare (Cato Il, 26). He had France in his hand, the pope and the Turk before Vienna, and did not take the opportunity. GOD greeted him, but he could not thank him. That is why Solomon in his "Ecclesiastes" laments this vanity, that GOD gives man the opportunity to gain something and he does not use it. This happens to our emperor, who now has to leave Milan, Savoy and choose the duke as cardinal. This is a shameful catastrophe. 


A different one from Duke John Frederick, Elector of Saxony. 


On August 21, 1532, Duke John Frederick, Elector of Saxony, came to Wittenberg and sent his greetings to D. Martin Luther. Martin Luthern his gracious greeting and ask him to preach tomorrow morning at 9 in the castle. When the doctor went home again after the sermon, and had dinner with some scholars, D. Jonas asked him after dinner to admonish the Elector and ask that a new visitation be held, because the church servants, pastors and preachers were now suffering extreme hardship. 


(Cordatus No. 763. 764 to end.) 


Those who now do not grant the servants of the Word their bread will drive us so long that we will cheat ourselves; after that they will worship our filth. They would like to be rid of us, so we would like to be rid of them. We are to be separated well, like a ripe dirt and a far arsloch. 1) 

Our Elector John Frederick now has seventy councilors from the very beginning of his reign, none of whom wants to be foolish, and they can all pretend their cause with big words. They cry out against it, even if we could do something with advice. But we will ask God to guide his heart 2c.

Cap. 46. of disagreement. § 1. 


1285 


The 46th chapter. 


Of disagreement. 


1. how to make unity. 2. one must yield to the other for the sake of peace. 3. of Saul's and David's disagreement. 


1. how to make unity. 


In 1546, on February 10, Luther's guests in Eisleben were Count Albrecht of Mansfeld and Count Hans Heinrich of Schwarzburg; Luther spoke of unity and said: "Duke Frederick, Elector, had agreed that things could be tolerated if the people could be tolerated, so that the people would also become cordially one, so that one would often have to yield to the other and give way. 

And the doctor said: "We all want to have unity, but no one seeks the means to unity, which is mutua chari- tas, communal love. In the same way, we all seek wealth, but no one seeks the right means of becoming rich, namely through God's blessing. So we all want to be saved, but the means by which we are saved, as the mediator, Christ, all the world does not want. 

He also said: "In the past, princes and lords have put their misguided actions and discord on faithful knightly people and did not let them come under the hands of lawyers soon. When Duke Ernst, the old Elector of Saxony, and his brother, Duke Albrecht, were at odds, they put the matter in the hands of the old man of Einsiedel, Lord Henry's and Abraham's| father. They did not sit down against each other, nov did they go among the jurists. 

Duke Frederick the Elder, Elector, and Duke William of Saxony also disagreed with each other so harshly that they marched against each other with large numbers of people, each doing great harm to the other. 





4. from anger. Why Christ curses so badly in the 109th Psalm, when he curses and warns in Matth. 5:34 ff. that one should not curse. 


When they came together at Leipzig with both armies to strike, the councilors on both sides had joined in and said, "It is not fitting that princes, and indeed cousins, should destroy themselves and their land and people in this way," and so the princes went together in their cuirasses to a hill that lay between the two camps and jtalked to each other. The people of war stood on both sides and watched. And as they went together, the knives fell 1) and talked but a little with one another; jthen they both opened the visors of [the] helmets, and continued to talk, and one shook hands with the other. When the trumpeters saw this, they sounded the trumpets, and there was great rejoicing in the camp, land the two lords became one with each other, and the erroneous things were ordered to be put away to the judges. So princes and lords should still talk to each other and be one for their person, and let their disputes be settled by the councilors. - 

To make unity, the Doctor Martinus Luther (when he acted at Eisleben between the Counts of Mansfeld, who were very much at odds) gave this agreement and said: If one had cut down a tree with many gnarled branches and twigs, and one wanted to bring it into a house or into a room, one must not want to grasp it in front by the top and pull it in, for there the branches would lock and lie back, for they all stand against the house or room; and if one therefore wanted to stretch the tree into the house or room by force, one would break all the branches.

1288 Cap. 46. of disagreement. § 3-5. 1289 


Did Samuel also come between Saul and David to make them agree? Then said the doctor: No, because it was the same disagreement, as with the pope and us. Saul's reign was to cease and David's to begin, and Samuel anointed David king to be against Saul. He saw that otherwise there would be no unity. Therefore, Samuel will be blamed for causing such a great disturbance in the kingdom of Israel. And David suffered much because of it; as Nabal reproached him, and Shimei also reproached him. For the prophets have always had to stand between the door and the hinge and let themselves be jammed. 


4. from anger. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: If one wants to learn to recognize an angry man, one knows him best at the game, at the bogeyman, and at the hunt, ibi non potest celari ira, quia amator odit Rivalem; and one becomes an enemy to the one who plays with one when he loses; and if one is denied something, he is also angry about it. 


Why Christ in the hundred and ninth Psalm, Deus laudem meam ne tacueris, curses so badly; when he beseeched and warned in Matt. 5:34 ff. that one should not curse? 


To this IX Martin Luther answered: That a Christian does not curse, nor avenge himself for his person, but faith curses and avenges itself. To understand this, one must separate God from man, person from thing. As for God and things, there is neither patience nor blessing. As when the wicked persecute the gospel, this affects God and his cause: there is neither blessing nor happiness to be wished, otherwise no one would have to preach or write against heresy, since this cannot happen without cursing. For whoever preaches or writes against them wishes that they perish, and does the worst and best that they may perish. 

These are the curses of faith, which, before it would let God's word perish and heresy stand, would wish that all creatures perish, because through heresy one loses God Himself, Deut. 16. But the person should not take revenge, but suffer everything, and do good to the enemy, according to the teaching of Christ and the way of love, Matth. 5, 44.

But when they say that they cannot make up for the good deed of his visit, he answers that it is his office and duty, therefore it is not necessary for them to give thanks. He also adds this consolation: they have no reason to be afraid, because it is certain that God, who has given them letter and seal (that is, His Word and Sacrament), will surely give them Himself as well.

1300 Cap. 48. of death. §2-7. 1301 


Death: but as soon as we grow up, become great and old, we begin to wallow in death and hell, and to fear them. 


Why St. Paul was not afraid of death. 


One asked D. M. Luther: When Agabus, the prophet, announced to St. Paul in Caesaria that he would be bound by the Jews and delivered to the Gentiles to die, Apost. 21:11, and yet he was not careful, but nevertheless he went to Jerusalem willingly and joyfully, fearing nothing of death: how would this come to pass? Luther answered: "It was the revelation of the Holy Spirit that strengthened Paul to death. 

When sick people lie in trains," said the doctor, "and give no sign, their souls are already gone, they hear nothing and understand nothing; therefore it is in vain and for nothing that one shouts to them. 


4, from M. Nicolai Hausmann's death. (Lauterbach, Nov. 6, 1538, p. 158.) 


On November 6, a letter arrived from Freiberg, in which the sudden death of the very pious and faithful pastor Hausmann there was announced. He had accepted a difficult office as a worn-out man and was so beaten to the ground and exhausted by the first sermon that he died of apoplexy that very day. This sad case with his most sincere friend we hid from the venerable father D. Luther, and little by little we, namely his wife, Philipp, Jonas and | (Lauterbach), let out that he was suffering, then that he was lying down heavily, finally that he died gently. Luther was very moved by the death of this man, and as he sat among his best friends, he repeatedly shed tears and said: "God takes away the pious, and then the chaff will be burned according to the saying of Scripture (Is. 57:1): "The righteous perish, and holy men are raised up. These are very dangerous times. GOD will sweep his threshing floor. | pray that when | die, my wife and children will not live long, there will be 


which are followed by very dangerous times. | would not have thought of such wickedness in the world. God help us to stick to his word, to mend our ways. This has been a dear friend to me. And so he sat the whole day quite sadly in the presence of Justus Jonas, Philipp Melanchthon, Joachim Camerarius, Caspar voli Kéckeritz, among whom he sat sadly and full of tears. 


5 You should not be too afraid of death. 


i)Anno 38, the 21st of October, that D. M. Luther publicly admonished the church and severely scolded those who were so afraid when people made a noise and rumor about the pestilence, saying: "One should be confident in the Lord and trust in Him, and each one should walk and remain in his profession, and if his neighbor needs his help and support, he should not leave him: we should not be so afraid of death, because we have taken hold of the word of life and the Lord of it, who has overcome death for our good. 


6. die for the sake of Christ. 


Death for the sake of Christ's name and word is glorious in the sight of God, Ps. 116:15, because otherwise we are mortal and must die for the sake of sin. But if we die for the sake of Christ's word, and we freely confess, we die a very honest death, become like holy things, and have sold our skin at a high enough price. But we who are Christians ask for peace and long life, not for our sake, for whom such a death is only vain gain, but for the sake of the descendants and the church. 


7. D. M. Luther's mourning, eulogy and speech, so he in the death and funeral of his dear daughter Magdalena, her age in the 14th year, had, 1542,

When Magdalenichen was in traction and was about to die, her father fell on his knees before the bed, wept bitterly, and prayed that God would deliver her. Then she died and passed away in her father's hands. The mother, however, was in the same room, but farther from the bed for the sake of her sadness. This happened a little after nine o'clock, on Wednesday after the fifteenth Sunday after Trinity, 1) Anno 1542. 

He, the doctor, often repeated as indicated above and said: | would like to keep my daughter, for | love her very much, if our Lord God would let me have her; but let His will be done. Nothing better can happen to her. While she was still alive, he said to her, "Dear daughter, you still have a father in heaven, to whom you will go. Philip said, "The love of parents is a likeness and image of the divinity imprinted on the human heart. Now if the love of God for the human race is as great as the love of parents for their children, as the Scripture says, it is truly great and fierce. 

When she was laid in the coffin, he said, "My dear Lena, how well you have done! Looking at her lying there, he said, "Oh, you! 


1) In all editions incorrect: "on Wednesday of the seventeenth Sunday after Trinity." Magdalena Luther died on 20 Seht. The letter to D. Justus Jonas, in which Luther says several things about the death of his daughter, is dated Sept. 23, 1542. Cf. 


Dear Lenichen, you will rise again and shine like a star, even like the sun. But since the coffin had been made too narrow and too short for her, he said: "The bed is too small for her, because she has now died. | am happy in spirit, but in the flesh | am very sad: the flesh does not want to come near, the separation vexes one beyond measure. It is a wonderful thing to know that she is certainly at peace and well, and yet still be so sad. 

And when the people came to help bury the body, and addressed the doctor according to common custom and usage, saying: They were sorry for his grief; he said, "Be it known to you, | have sent a saint to heaven, yes, a living saint. O if we had such a death! | would have accepted such a death at this hour. Then one said, "Yes, it is true, but everyone likes to keep his own." Luther answered, "Flesh is flesh, and blood is blood; | am glad that it is gone, there is no sorrow but of the flesh.

When they buried her, he said, "This is the resurrection of the flesh. And when they came again from the burial, he said, "My daughter is now buried, both in body and soul. 2c. We Christians have nothing to complain about, we know that it must be so, we are ever most certain of eternal life; for God, who has promised it to us through and for the sake of His dear Son, cannot ever lie. Our Lord God has two saints from my flesh, but not from the flower. 

Among other things, he said: "Children must be cared for, especially the poor ones.

Item: | give this daughter to our Lord God very gladly, but according to the flesh | would have liked to keep her longer with me; but because he has taken her away, | thank him. 

When Magdalena, Martin Luther's daughter, died in 1542, Martin Luther's wife had had a dream the night before that she had thought that two beautiful, young, well-decorated journeymen had come and wanted to lead her daughter to the wedding. When Philip Melanchthon came to the monastery in the morning and asked her what her daughter was doing, she told him the dream. But he was frightened by it, and said to others, "The young fellows are the dear angels, who will come and lead this virgin into the kingdom of heaven, into the right wedding.

11. separation of a good marriage. 


Anno 1539, the 15th of July, died the honest, virtuous matron, Doctor Blickarts, the Sindringer's, 1) housewife, who got up early at five o'clock from her master's bed, pregnant, fresh and healthy, and at seven o'clock after that she was dead, having brought a young daughter. Then Doctor Martin Luther comforted her master. Afterwards, when he came home, he said: "It must be the greatest sadness and heartache, when two pious spouses, who have been well with each other and held each other dear, have to part from each other bodily. Our Lord God is the greatest adulterer, who brings them together and separates them from each other. This morning she slept with her husband, today 2) she sleeps with our Lord God. How slippery and unstable is our life! Oh, it must hurt when spouses who love each other are divorced in this way. 


12. from papist" BegangniB. 


Under the papacy, the corpse was buried with such pomp that the ceremonies and customs of the Jews far surpassed those of all the pagans. Duke Albrecht of Saxony was buried with such pomp that six hundred priests held mass four days in a row and were fed sumptuously: then they bought up from all the merchants the gold pieces, so many large wax candles, like the Easter candles, were sacrificed. Then the marshal of the prince smashed petschier, and four and twenty paniers fell down, and waxen coats of arms were broken 2c. No pagan or Jew would hold such pomp and pageantry.

This is what D. Martin to all men. Cicero was able to comfort himself finely as Luther said about the death of von Haubitz. a pagan, in the first book of the Tusculana. Much more should the Christians do this, who have the overcomer of death, Christ, who is the resurrection and the life. And even if we would like to live longer, it is still a short time. Just as if you wandered a lot against thieves [or thieves], some coming in at 4 o'clock, some at 7 or §, all must stay there overnight. Thus Adam preceded us by a few hours.

18. You should not be so afraid of death. 


Because we know, said D. M. L. that we must die and that Christ is our Lord and we are baptized in His name, why are we afraid of death? Therefore let us only die in God's name, we will not be harmed by it. We want to master Christ in time, like Philip and Andrew, John 6:7, 8. It is not right, but God can keep it too good for us, because we praise Him and preach about Him; and that is something, if only we do not become Judas, His betrayers. 


19 Jn 8:51: "He who keeps my word will never see death”. Thus, D. M. Luther interpreted the saying: (This A is Walch, old edition, vol. IX, 1426.)

After that he lamented the misery of human life, which all men loved; no one wanted to leave it, although one misfortune after the other was imminent until death. That is why Pliny, Book 20, Cap. 1, 1) says that a timely death is the best medicine for a man, and Julius Caesar disdained the omens of his death and did not flee the dangers, saying: It is better to die once than to be always on guard. That is 


see the wrath of God, but think it is the end of man, and say: It is about an evil hour. But Cicero said wonderfully: Afterwards we will either be nothing or completely blessed, as if he wanted to say: Nothing worse can happen to us than death. 


The death of godly and righteous Christians is a sign of God's wrath. (Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 163.) 


Luther: When | hear that a pious man has died, | am frightened and fear that God is angry with the world, who takes away the pious to attack the wicked. Germany, repent at the time of grace, it is time; even if | die, there is not much in me, because | am under the pope's spell, | am his devil, therefore he hates and persecutes me. 


24 A lansquenet's insulting speech about death. 


Doctor Martin Luther once told over the table: "A soldier was lying ill with an innkeeper, and as he was about to die, he said, 'Innkeeper, bring a light here, death wants Sanct Velten. And he said, "The men of war speak of the things of our Lord God as of cobbler's leather. One should not joke with death. Mors est judicium Dei et ira Dei: In death, God's judgment and wrath exist. One should not joke with death, because one first has faith in the Lord, who is crucified. After that it is said: Mors, ubi est Stimulus tuus? Death, where is your sting? 1 Cor. 15> 55.

27. M. Luther is tired of life. 

(Here 3 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 48, § 38.) 

Anno 1539, on June 11, Luther drove from Wittenberg to Liechtenberg, to the old Margravine, Electress. When he ate in the evening with her F. G. and talked about all sorts of things over the table with each other, and the Margravine said: She wished and hoped that he should still live a long time, and he could still live well forty years, if it were God's will. Then said D. Luther said: "God be merciful! If he offered me paradise in which to live for another forty years, | would not accept it: | would hire an executioner to cut off my head. So evil is the world now, and people are becoming vain devils, that one can wish him nothing better than only a blessed hour and away. | don't ask anything about the doctors either: | don't want to make my life, which is set for me by them for one year, sour, but eat and drink in God's name what tastes good to me.

When M. Luther had preached at Schmalkalden on the Sunday of Invocavit in 1537, he became very ill

Praise be to you, my Lord Jesus, that | die knowing your name! | will now do what God wills, and even surrender to His grace. If we have received the good from the hand of the Lord, why should we not also take the evil with us? | die as an enemy of Pabst, the evil one who has exalted himself over Christ. And there he made the verses: Quaesitus toties, toties tibi Roma petitus, En ego per Christum vivo Lutherus adhuc. Una mihi spes est, qua non fraudabor, Jesus, Hunc mihi dum teneam, perfida Roma cave... In German: Luther, who was so often sought by Rome, is still in the living order until this hour, As long as Jesus, the anchor of hope, does not break. Rome certainly did nothing against him. 


29. prophecy of D. Luther's prophecy of his death. 


In 1546, on February 16, when there was a lot of talk about dying and sickness over Luther's table in Eisleben, Luther said: "When | return home to Wittenberg, | will lie down in a coffin and give the maggots a fat doctor to eat. M. Luther said: "When | return home to Wittenberg, | will lie down in a coffin and give the maggots a fat doctor to eat. And this was true for two days, that D. M. Luther lived there in ice. M. Luther died there in Eisleben.

A hardened heart is not moved by promises, is not frightened by threats, is not bowed by the hardest blows [flagellis], and by plagues it is so little improved that it only becomes harder.

31 Death's smack. 


To taste death properly is certainly and actually proper despair. Godly Christians will not taste death, as Christ says John 8:51: for they never feel utter despair: though at times they are very near to it, yet they are withdrawn and preserved by the Holy Spirit. 


32. contempt of death. 


Doctor M. Luther said about how one should despise death, and said: One ran from St. Vincentio, when he should have died, that he had seen death standing before his feet, and had said: What do you want, death? do you think that you want or can gain something from a Christian? do you not know that | am a Christian? So we should also learn to mock and laugh at death. 


33) How St. Martin despised death. 


Doctor M. Luther said that he would like the legend of the saints to be fasted finely, as Philip Melanchthon had finely described the legend of St. Ambrosia; and said: "There is sometimes much good in it, as in the history of St. Martin stands: when he was about to die, the devil stood at his feet in his bed, then he said boldly to him: See, quid tu hic stas, horrenda Bestia, nihil habes in me. This is a true word of faith. Such a thing should be gleaned from the legends of the saints, and not from all kinds of folly. 


34. how to drive away the sad thoughts and thoughts of death. 


Doctor M. Luther (when he once saw a very sad person) said: Oh man, what are you doing? Can you think of nothing else but your sins, death and damnation? Turn away thine eyes quickly, and look hither unto the man which is called Christ; of whom it is written, that he was conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of Mary of virgins, suffered, died, was buried, went to hell, rose from the dead the third day, and ascended into heaven 2c. 


Cap. 48. of death. §31-37. 





1315 


Why do you think this has happened? Numquid, that thou shouldest be comforted against death and sin. Therefore cease from fear and trembling; thou hast, verily, no cause. If Christ were not there and had not done this for you, you would have cause to fear; but he is there, suffering death for you, and conquering it for your comfort and protection, and for this reason also sits down at the right hand of his heavenly Father to represent you. Now whatis not on such a blow, that is Mosi's testimony, of which one has nothing else but fear and terror. 


Fidelis animae vox ad Christum. 


Ego sum tuum peccatum, Tu mea _justitia. Triumpho igitur securus, quia nec meum peccatum obruet tuam Justitiam, nec tua Justitia sinet me esse aut manere peccatorem. Benedictus Dominus Deus meus, Miserator meus et Redemtor meus, in Te solum confido, nunquam erubescam.

The creatures are a testimony of the resurrection of the dead. 


In 1539, on the 11th day of April, M. Luther was in his garden and looked at the trees with a running thought, how they blossomed, budded and greened so beautifully and charmingly, and was very surprised about it, and said: Praise be to God, the Creator, who makes everything alive again from dead, deceased creatures. Look at the branches," he said, "they are so lovely and delicate, as if they were pregnant and full of young and close to birth. There we have a beautiful picture of the resurrection of the dead. Winter is death, but summer is the resurrection of the dead, when everything comes to life and grows green again.

How many deaths [mortes] we have in our body! Is nothing but vain death with us, because so much death, so many limbs. This he said to Conrad Cordatus. 2) 

2) For the devil, who is the cause and master of death, is our adversary and seeks our life. He has sworn death upon us, and we have deserved it, therefore we may well endure the hour. But with the godly he will not achieve much with his stranglehold, because he will bite into a dead nut.

39. how Martin Luther's father, Hans Luther, died blessedly. 


In 1530, Luther's father, Hans Luther, died at Mansfeld, to whom Martinus from Wittenberg, 3) a few days before his end, had written a beautiful, wonderful letter of comfort. When Mr. Michael Cdlius, pastor in the Mansfeld valley, had asked him in his last moments: whether he believed everything that was taught and held out to us in the articles of the Christian faith? he had replied: That would have to be a lurker, who would not believe the

2) The next following paragraph was found twice more, namely in § 27 of this Cap., and Cap. 24, § 104 in all previous editions of the German Tischreden.

because the older we get, the more foolish we become. And this | prove thus: for the young people remain straightforward in the articles of the Christian faith; as they have learned the same, so they also believe the same: but when we grow old, we begin to dispute, want to be wise, and yet are the greatest fools. 


40 Which is the very best way to die. 


Doctor Martin Luther once said: There is no better way to die than St. Stephen, who says: Domine Jesu, suscipe Spiritum meum: "Lord JEsu, receive my spirit’, Apost. 7, 58, that we lay aside all registers of our sins and meritorious works, and die on the mere grace of God alone. St. Stephen learned this from two great persons, the Lord Christ and David, who were certainly more pious than any monk or priest; yet they were silent about their merits and demanded only grace. 


41 Judgement of D. Luther's judgment of the saying Matth. 24, 24: "Errors will come that even the elect would be deceived if it were possible. 


This saying has been fulfilled and true in the Holy Fathers, as in St. Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, Basil, Cyprian, Bernard and others, who were led astray, but did not remain in it. St. Bernard wrote many evil and ungodly things, especially about the Virgin Mary. But when he was about to die, he said: Perdite vixi: 4) | have lived wickedly, but you, dear Lord Jesus Christ, have two rights to the kingdom of heaven: first, it is your inheritance, because you are the only one who has the right to it.

1320 Cap. 49: Of the resurrection of the dead and eternal life. § 1-4. 


1. of the resurrection of Christ and his death. 


(This §, except for the last two paragraphs, contains a narrative of what Luther preached in church on the Sunday of Cantate in the afternoon of 1544. It is a meager excerpt from the sermon on the resurrection of the dead, Walch, old edition, vol. VIII, 1406 ff, therefore omitted). 


In the evening he, the doctor, said at home: He would have had another concept and matter in mind, of which he would have been willing to preach, and would have come safely to the article of God's omnipotence, which sermon was simple and more audible to the common man. 

Item: | see, said D. Martinus, that our Lord God has a good concern of the article where we say: | believe a resurrection of the dead. For, should it remain as it is now, with sweeping out and cleansing 2c., who could wait and see it come to pass? Therefore it is best that he take the pot and break it, and thrust it into the clay, and make it new, as Jeremiah says. 


2. another of the resurrection of the dead. 


| will rise again, said D. Martinus, and | will be able to talk to you again. This finger, on which this ring is stuck, must become mine again. In sum, everything must return, for it is written in 2 Peter 3:13: "God will create new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness will dwell." There will be no empty or idle regiment. There will be joy and delight, for heaven and earth will not be barren sand. 

When a person is happy, a small tree, even a beautiful flower or bush, makes him happy; but when he is sad, no tree can really be looked at. Heaven and earth will be renewed, and we believers will all be one group. If we were all one here, there would be great peace among us: but God makes it otherwise, that here and there we are divided, so that we long and groan for the future Father.

country, and thus grow weary of this tedious life. 

Now if there is to be joy in the elect, there must be supreme sadness and despair in the damned 2c. A rustling leaf has no horns. When have you heard that a rustling leaf has struck or poked a hole in one's head? Nevertheless, an ungodly and unbeliever is frightened by it. But not a Christian, for in Christ he has peace; but the wicked have no peace. 


3. Abraham's faith in the resurrection of the dead. 


Abraham had to believe in the resurrection of the dead, because he wanted to kill his son Isaac, through whom God had promised him to multiply his seed and lineage like the stars in the sky; as the epistle to the Eberians, Cap. 11, v. 17 ff. finely indicates. Our greatest challenge is that our Lord God is called a liar, since the Gentiles say, "Where is their God? It is as if God does not believe what He has promised. 

Item: When Christ blows the trumpet on the last day, then they will all come up again and rise, like the flies that lie dead in winter, but toward summer, when the sun comes, they will come to life again; in the same way, the birds that lie dead during the winter in nests or stone caves, and in crevices, as the cuckoo, swallows and others, in the hollow banks by the water, will come to life again toward spring; as experience testifies. 


4. of the spirits of the wicked, and the resurrection of the wicked. 


D. M. Luther said to his table companions in 1540: "Oh, how we must suffer so many sects and troubles, for one always comes after the other: when one is settled, another soon comes; when such has died away, a new one is soon here again. And it is certain that there will be many more sects after my death, because the

spiritus mendax et homicida does not celebrate. Who would have thought of the Grickel's foolishness? But God will preserve his Christianity. D. Severus said: "Your confession, Doctor, pleases me well as Coena Domini, and the word that you have added to it (as, as | want to preserve this article of the Sacrament, so | trust, with God, to preserve all the other articles also by the Scriptures) has deterred many, and drawn back many, who otherwise would have brought all kinds of error on the path: for there were some who wanted to dispute the divinity of Christ. Then D. Luther answered and said: | have noticed it well, that is why | have acted so diligently on this article, and have especially well struck out in the three symbolisms. It will not be necessary. 

Many still doubt the article about the ungodly resurrection, said D. Severus. Luther answered: "It is diligently traced in the 15th chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians. Then M. Johannes Mathesius, Luther's table companion, had asked: "Doctor, in the Symbola there is first Remissio peccatorum, and then Carnis resurrectio, which thus reads, "Only those should rise from the dead who have the forgiveness of sins? Then said D. Luther: "There are clear, bright sayings of the Scriptures, as, Joh. 5, 28. 29. and Matth. 25, 32. and elsewhere in the Bible about the resurrection of the dead. And I have dealt with it in the same chapter to the Corinthians v. 50, that flesh and blood will not see the kingdom of God. There M. Mathesius spoke: It would be another thing not to see and not to be resurrected. The doctor answered: Sunt diversa praedicata de uno subjecto. Prince Hans Frederick read the same interpretation of the 15th chapter of Corinthians with pleasure.

When we get to heaven, we will have ten thousand years to marvel at the abominations of the pope, and after that at the monarchies and other great wickednesses, and we will be surprised that God allowed them to suffer so long. And | believe that the Pope has not heard one sermon in his whole life. 


In eternal life all creatures will be lovely, and the bodies will be glorified. 


When D. Martinus and others had joked with each other for a long time, they came to serious matters, namely to talk about eternal life, how heaven and earth would become new, as Adam and Eve had fallen from paradise, that is, out of God's grace and favor. But in Christ we all have another future and eternal life. There will be a new heaven and a new earth: the flowers, foliage and grass will be as beautiful, joyful and lovely as an emerald, and all creatures will be most beautiful. If only we have God's grace, all God's creatures will laugh at us. If | say to the brick that it shall become an emerald, it shall be done from that hour. And in the new heaven there will be a great, eternal light and loveliness. 


(The following in this § at Cordatus No. 807. 808. 809. 810.) 


What we would like to be now, we will be in that life, and where the thoughts will be, there will also be our bodies, because even in this life the body obeys the will. For whatever the will decides, there the body must follow, whether for good or for evil. This will take place much more in the future life, when the body will be lighter and more flexible than a feather, and everything that is considered beautiful now will be nothing there. According to this opinion also Isaiah [65, 17.] and Peter [2. Ep. 3, 13:] speak of a new heaven and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. Righteousness and peace will be there, and all that we may wish for, peace, security 2c. Of such things they spoke after the lies. 2) 

A joyful heart sees everything cheerfully, but a sad heart sees everything sadly; for a change of heart brings about a great change in all things. Hence it is that when we rejoice, we see even the smallest grasses cheerfully and admire their form, which we throw away and

Cap. 50. Of damnation and hell. § 1-4. 


122A 





The 50th chapter. 


Of damnation and hell. 


1. what is teeth chattering. 

According to and from God's word, one can certainly judge who is damned. 

3. from the eternal hellish torment. 


1. what tooth chatter is. 1) (Cordatus No. 811.) 


We can understand the fire and the gnashing of teeth as an external punishment that will follow an evil conscience. And the despair that one is divorced from God is a [not] less terrible punishment, for such a conscience fears all creatures, which we also see now. For a falling leaf has not yet killed anyone, and yet it is feared, and it terrifies a fearful heart. When the heart is despondent, it is terrified of every creature, even the good ones. 


According to and from God's word, one can certainly judge who is damned. (Contained in Cap. 9, § 19.) 


3. from the eternal hellish torment. (Lauterbach, Aug. 16, 1538, p. 113.) 

On August 16, when Luther considered the misery and misfortune of this life, with how innumerable diseases this mortal body would be plagued in this life, he said: "If the pains of the life to come are to be greater and constant, then these bodies of ours, as they are now, cannot bear it. They can hardly bear the sufferings of this life, which last only for a moment, and it seems to me that they will be other bodies. And soon he added this improvement: Let us break off from this matter, it is only my thoughts. God forbid that we should not know. Let us be here in the number of those of whom it is said (Matth. 5, 4.): "Blessed are they that mourn." For even here on earth there are various and 


1) Cf. cap. 49, § 2. 


4. four degrees of punishment after this life. 5 Of the saying of Isa. 7:9: If ye believe not, ye shall not abide. 


unequal temptations according to the difference of the persons. If another should have endured the temptations that | have endured], he would have been dead for a long time. So | could not have endured the angel of Satan beating with fists, just as Paul could not have endured the exceedingly severe temptations of Christ. In short, sadness is death in the greatest proximity and in a moment. But we are not to dispute about it, but to put it in God's courts and look at what is revealed. 


4. of the four degrees of punishment after this life. 


The ancients made four kinds of distinctions and degrees of hell; first, the outer castle, in which the archfathers were said to have dwelt until Christ went to hell. Secondly, the feeling of torment, but only temporally, as purgatory. The third, where the unbaptized infants are to be inside, but feel no pain. The fourth, where the damned are, so they feel eternal pain and torture, that is the real hell. With the other three it is only a human poem. But it has been sung badly in the papacy in the chant: Cum Rex gloriae etc.. Te nostra vocabant suspiria, Te larga requirebant lamenta,: Our sighs called to you, our miserable laments sought you 2c. This is not right nor Christian. For the gospel says: They are in Abraham's bosom. Thus saith Isaias Cap. 57:2, "They go into their chambers." And Jesus Sirach: "The righteous is in the hand of the Lord" (Weish. 3, 1.), he dies as he wants, since he would be immediately overtaken with death; therefore there was no sighing nor complaining. The wretched 


1330 


People have drawn the heartfelt sighing and longing of the prophets, which they had in this life after Christ the Messiah, that they waited for the dead. But what hell is, we do not know, except that it is a certain place, as Luc. 16, 26. is written of the rich man, when Abraham said to him, "There is a great gulf between you and us." For if it were known, and the Scriptures had indicated something about this place, there would be no end nor measure to the disputing. Therefore let us remain simple in the child's faith. 


Cap. 50. Of damnation and hell. § 4. 5. 


1331 


Is. 7, 9: If you do not believe, you will not remain. 


That is, if you do not believe, you will not remain. All things are incomprehensible to our Lord God, but there, in that life, he said he would show us everything and give us an account of why he had done it that way. We Christians have, thanks be to God, a great advantage that our faith is so powerfully founded in the Holy Scriptures, and is always in agreement. Nevertheless, the Turk or the Jew do not have this.

1. D. Luther's thoughts about the last day. 


Doctor Martinus said: 1) O dear God, come once; | always wait for the day, early around spring, when day and night are the same, and will become a very clear bright dawn. But these are my thoughts, and | will preach about them: Soon out of the dawn shall come a thick black cloud, and there shall be three flashes of lightning; and after that there shall be one stroke, and all shall be heaped together in one moment, heaven and earth. But praise be to God, who has taught us to sigh for the day and to desire it.

should. In the papacy, all the world feared it, as they also sang in song: Dies illa, dies irae etc. This day, a day of wrath 2c. | hope that the day is not far away, and we still want to experience it. 

Then one said, "Doctor, shall the gospel not be preached anywhere at this time? For Christ says, He will hardly find faith on earth. Yes, said D. Martinus, what does it mean that we have the gospel in corners? Where do you reckon that all Asia and Africa have no gospel, and in Europe, Greece and Italy, Hungary, Hispania, France, England and Poland no gospel is preached? The little spot, the house of Saxony, will not hinder the last day. 


1332 


2M. Michael Stiefel's Fallacy of Judgment Day. 1) 


Anno 1533, Sept. 28, M. Stiefel came to Wittenberg, talked secretly alone with M. Luther and showed him his opinion and opinion with twenty-two articles, from the last day, that he would come on St. Lucas' Day. But he was told to keep quiet. This made him very angry, and he said: "Dear doctor, | am surprised that you forbid me to preach, and that you do not want to believe me when it is certain that | must say it, since | do not like to do it. Then said D. Martinus: "Dear master, if you have been able to bear the silence for ten years in the papacy, please keep quiet for a short time 2c. Oh, how gladly he (Stiefel) would have brought me to his opinion; for he said: Oh, how it grieves me, how sorry | am that you do not believe this. And he remembered a farmer who was a miller, and had also announced beforehand that he would come on this day, which passed yesterday. And I, said he, when | was early in the way, as the sun was about to rise, saw a very beautiful rainbow, and thought of the future of Christ. Then said D. Martinus said: No, it will not happen with rainbows, but in one stroke fire, thunder, lightning will consume the whole creature. It is only a matter of one stroke. In a moment we will all be dead and changed. A mighty, strong trumpet or dromet sound will renew and awaken us all. It will not be a friendly sound of a shawm, so those who are in graves shall hear it soon. 

S. also sets in his book a certain time when the last day would come. Namely, the 1533rd year, in the tenth moon, in the forty-second week, on Monday at the eighth hour. Now let it come, said D. Martinus: M. S. said against me eighteen weeks ago that he should certainly come before Michaelmas. We _ have Michaelmas 


1) The extensive narrative in the first three paragraphs of this § is most likely formed from Cordatus No. 1731, which we have included in Appendix No. II.

available except for one day, you may send yourselves. | would like to give away my children's patronage money, but | am afraid that no one will want to accept it, because tomorrow evening at six is the time when we will all be sitting in heaven. Oh, how ashamed we will be! After that, in the evening of Michaelmas, he said at noon, over the table, "We still have eight hours to the last day: for according to the Jewish or Hebrew way, the day begins in the evening at vespers: so Michaelmas is present. 

M. S. also had this argument that he pretended that Christ as the Son of Man had not known the certain time when the last day would come after mankind, but after his resurrection, the forty days before his ascension, he had known it well and revealed it. And he (Boots) would be the last trumpet. 

Then spoke D. Martinus: Yes, Christ knew it well even after mankind, but he should not know it to reveal it to men, because he was not sent for it. 


(Cordatus No. 443 to "youngest days.") 


It will yet become so evil on earth that people will cry out in every corner: O Lord, come with the last day! 

And he, D. Luther, had a paternoster of white agate stones 2) in his hand, and said: If God wanted the day to come soon, | would eat this paternoster now, so that it would come tomorrow. 


(The last paragraph, Cordatus No. 951, is transferred to the following 8, where it belongs). 


3, martini thoughts and account of the last day, that he can no longer be far away. (Cordatus No. 951. 952.953. 1246.) 

The end of the world is here, it has come to the yeast. Whoever wants to start something, let him do it at the right time. The pleasures of this world are over. That is why the old peasants before Vienna will have thought: Lord God, has it come to this, that we are to be under the Turk? Everything is changing. If | were to come to my father's house, | would be looked at much differently. 


2) In the editions: "Agtsteinen". 


1334 


than before. The best thing that came out of my father's estate is that he educated me; for there is no greater good in housekeeping than to feed students. 

The Scriptures are purely washed out, so that it cannot be that the last day is far, and | have had terrible dreams of the last judgment from the middle of the year. The present time, compared to the past, is barely a hand's breadth, a leftover little apple hanging on the tree. 

Daniel has described the world by the world empires of the Persians, Greeks and Romans. The pope has received the Roman empire, that is St. John's last drink, 1) that also falls to him. In the sky many signs happen, on the earth there is building beyond measure, also planting and collecting treasures. The arts now go beyond all measure. | hope that God will put an end to it and not look at the astronomers who say that in the year 40 the golden age will come again. 

It is destined by fate that all pastors in Lochau become enthusiasts. Michael Stiefel, a godly man, has fallen into this delusion that he is the seventh angel who precedes the last day with his divine revelation. He has the trumpet of the seventh angel and is certain when this day will come. That is why he gives away his household utensils to the people for free, because they are no longer necessary for him. 


4. proclamation of D. M. Luther's Proclamation of the Last Day. 


Anno 1536 spoke D. Martinus: It is in Apocalypsi come up to the white horse. The world will not stand long; if God wills, not over a hundred years. The Lord deliver us from evil, amen. 


5. from the last day. 


When the Turk (said D. M. Luther) begins to fall a little, then the last day will certainly come, because it must be there, 


1) The feast of St. John the Evangelist on 27 December at the end of the year. Here St. John's drink - farewell drink.

§ 3-6. 1335 

de necessitate Scripturae, according to the Scriptures. He will then come, the dear Lord, as the Scripture says: Cum adhuc semel veniam, tum commovebo Coelum et Terram, et tum veniet desiderabilis omnibus Gentibus: "When | come once more, then will | move heaven and earth, then shall come the consolation of all nations", Hagg. 2, 7. 8. There are now enough movements in the political state. The lawyers have never had more to do than now. So there are all kinds of disputes in the household, even among the servants, item, our own sons and daughters; the church, too, has _ its movements. 


6. at the last judgment, the splendor of the wicked will all disappear. 


(The first paragraph of this tz in Lauterbach, March 3, 1538, p. 44.) 


On March 3. March, Luther had the banquet of his kingdom 2) There they dined. Psalms were recited, Gospels, the Catechism, prayers, as each one had been instructed to do, but his servants were very timid in reciting them. He said: What will become there before the last judgment, where the godless people will be publicly condemned and will have to give account? It is a great majesty of that judgment, which all men will then be forced to fear; even if here the godless walk along in extreme presumption and contempt in their well-being, they must nevertheless be wary of that judgment. There all their glory and all men's counsel will disappear, and the thoughts even of the devil will come to light. Therefore, Paul and the other apostles look forward to this day of judgment with the greatest confidence against the ungodly 2). 

On the last day there will be a great change and collapse: for then all the elements will melt and become ashes, and the whole world will again become a desolate lump, as in the beginning. There

3) Immediately after this follows the second paragraph of 217 of Chapter 7. 


1336 Cap. 51. Of the last day. § 6-12. 1337 


will be a new heaven and earth, and we will be changed. But the devil will remain as he is, because he has nothing of elements. As St. Paul, who had great revelation, indicates. 


7. of the last day. 


Doctor Martin Luther once said: "| am quite certain that the day of the Lord is near, and that either we, or at least our descendants, will experience this day. For all great signs have now come to pass; the Antichrist is revealed and the world rages. And will it not be better in the world before the last day comes. 


8. The world will go wild just before the Last Day. (Contained in Cap. 1, § 12.) 


0. another concern of D. M. L. about the last day, about what time it will come. 


Around the Easter time in April, when people are least afraid of the rain, Pharaoh perished in the Red Sea and the people of Israel were led out of Egypt. At the same time the world was created. At the same time the year changed, and Christ rose again, and the world was renewed. So perhaps also at the same time the last day will come. | have the thought that this day will come after and around Easter, when the year is most beautiful and merry, and early, when the sun goes out, as in Sodom and Gomorrah. The sky will be cloudy, with thunder and earthquakes, for an hour or a little longer. Then the people who see it will say: Behold, behold, thou fool, hast thou never heard thunder? And so the world will suddenly be overtaken, and many a man's debt will not be paid. "We who are alive," says St. Paul in 1 Thess. 4:15, which must be understood of us who are still alive. For we are all alike in imputation before God, who counts us as righteous, and imputes Christ's righteousness to us: but there is a difference among the saints, of the gifts, of the things, of the things, of the things. 


half. This is by grace, not by merit. For as there is a difference among the stars, in that one is clearer and brighter than another; so shall it be also among the saints, after this life, in eternal life. St. Augustine says: "God crowns his gifts in men; to whom he has given great and excellent gifts here, he will also be clearer and more glorious than others there: but those who have not had such gifts here will not be so clear, and yet will have perfect joy. 


10. what God's children are capable of in eternal life. 


In the life to come | will say: there will be cherries, grapes, birds, trees 2c., so shall it soon be; for we shall be children of GOD. 

Item: After the revelation of the Antichrist, the world will do what it wants, and even get into an epicurean nature and life, not believing that there is a God. Then the last day will not be far away. 


(11) Whether Christians will know at the last day of all the impiety of the wicked. 


One of them asked: "Will the godly also know all the wickedness and wickedness of the wicked on the last day? M. Luther said: Yes, indeed; for we know in this life not only how God is disposed toward us, but also the secret thoughts of the wicked. | know what the pope, emperor, bishop of Mainz 2c. think, because they are godless, do not respect God, do not have certain thoughts of God, do not ask anything about Him. 


12. ask for the last day. 


Doctor Martin Luther said to Doctor Jonah: "Teach your church to pray diligently for the day of the Lord, for it has come at a good time, and so it is over; it will not be better. But God does not hear, for the cry for our redemption at the last day, and all signs agree that it is not far off. 


1338 


Cap. 51. Of the last day. § 13. 





The last day will separate the righteous from the wicked. 


The true art of alchemy is truly the philosophy of the ancient sages, which | like very much, not only for its many benefits, which it brings to melting, separating, separating and preparing metals; item, herbs, roots and other things to distill and sublimate, but also for the allegories and secret interpretation, which is extremely beautiful, namely the resurrection of the dead at the last day. For just as in a furnace the fire draws from matter and separates what is best, even the spirit, spirit, life, juice and strength, it leads it upward so that it takes the top of the helmet, sticks to it, and then flows down; as one sees when one distills herbal water or that one distills something else; there the finest floats upward, and the best always floats upward. But the impure matter and yeasts leave it at the bottom. 





1339 


as a dead carrion and nothing. In the same way, when distilled wine is made, all the substance and essence is extracted by the fire, and the power rises to the top; what is left remains at the bottom, and it neither smells nor tastes, but is an unformed water. In the same way, all power and strength is extracted and separated from the cinnamon bark and nutmeg, if one wants to burn water or prepare an oil from it; then the good is led upward, and what remains is without smell and taste, like rotten wood. God will do the same thing on the last day and at the last judgment, separating the righteous from the wicked by fire. The Christians and the righteous will ascend to heaven above and live in it forever. But the ungodly and the damned will remain in hell as the basic soup and yeast, and will be damned therein, and will remain in death forever. 


The 52nd chapter. 


Of allegories and spiritual interpretations of Scripture, how to deal with them.

1. description of the allegories. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1046.) 


Allegories, if everything is related to faith, are good and praiseworthy, but related to life, they are dangerous. | hate them, however, mainly for the sake of it, when they drive life more than faith, and when they are used excessively, they take away the power of the story. 


7. of allegories, and when Lutherus had abandoned them. 

8. D. Luther's Best Art. 

In the words of the Lord's Supper, the "Sacramen" want to make a trope, as in the place a figurist: | am the right vine. 


Summa, allegories or spiritual interpretations are the whore's brat, its polished, and yet do not hold the sting: they prove nothing: they are not legitimate women: we shall not use them lightly unless the main matter is first sufficiently proved with strong arguments and reasons. As we see that St. Paul did to the Galatians, Cap. 4, 21. ff. The corpus, the body, is the dialectica; but allegoria is the rhetorica. 


1340 Cap. 52. Of allegories and spiritual interpretations of Scripture 2c. § 1-5. 


1341 








Now rhetoric, which decorates and emphasizes a thing in length with words, is of no use without dialectics, which summarizes a thing briefly. If one rhetoricizes and makes many words. without foundation, since there is nothing behind, then it is only a decorated thing, and carved and painted idol. 


2. from St. Margaret Legend. (Cordatus No. 1049.) 


The legend of Margaret has an ecclesiastical allegory [meaning]. But the church is a noble virgin and splendid gem. Olibrius, the tyrant, is the world, which enmitigates the church and throws it into prison, where it is plagued by the dragon, the devil, and it cannot free itself from the heavy challenge in any other way than by seizing the cross, which is Christ, who alone drives out and overcomes the devil. Similar is that of Christophorus 2c. 


3. what allegories are. (Cordatus No. 980-982.) 


Allegory is that one gives a thing for and understands it differently than the words read, and it is in a [whole] sentence, the metaphor in [individual] expressions and words. The holy scripture and the German language are full of allegories: He hangs his coat to the wind; Much clamor, little wool; Kathe von Bora is the morning star at Wittenberg. The words make metaphors, but the things make allegories, as Christ's command of foot washing, of baptism, of the Lord's Supper are allegories. 1) 

The allegories must not be held as they read, as when Daniel [7, 7.] says of 


1) In order to understand this sentence correctly, it must be noted that Luther is not dealing here with the essence, but with the meaning, allegory. The action of washing the feet means the serving love (Joh. 13, 14. 15.); the action of baptism means the drowning of the old Adam and the resurrection of the new man (Rom. 6, 4.); the action of Holy Communion, eating and drinking the body and blood of Christ, means the thanksgiving for the suffering and death of the Lord (1 Cor. 11, 26.). Therefore Luther used in this case in the Latin original the rare word LueUaristia i.e. "thanksgiving". - The last two sentences of this § are transferred to § 10 of the appendix, where they belong. 


the beast that has ten horns, it is understood to mean the Roman Empire. Thus, circumcision is an allegory in the New Testament, not in the Old, in which they had to keep it very precise. 

The New Testament makes allegories out of the Old, which speaks only of things that have happened, as of the two sons of Abraham, out of whom Paul makes two nations. But let us not make such allegories as the red spirits. 


4. from the knight St. George. (Cordatus No. 1048.) 


The legend of St. George contains in itself a very beautiful allegory concerning the world government - the girl is the worldly government, which is attacked by a dragon, who is the devil. But he attacks her, sometimes with famine, sometimes with pestilence, even by war he devours and devastates her, until a pious and brave emperor comes, who restores and defends her. 


5. boldness of the sophists to write and play with allegories. (The first paragraph of this § in Cordatus No, 148.) 


It is an ungodliness what in these verses the sophists and some of the fathers have passed off for godliness: 


Littera gesta docet, quid credas, Allegoria, Moralis, quid agas, quo tendas, Anagogia. 1) [The letter teaches what has happened, allegory what is to be believed. 

Moralis teaches what one should do, anagogy where it should go. Walch] and since they asserted and praised such, they were nevertheless unable to perform it, however often they wanted to. For it could have been spoken much more correctly, or more appropriately, by a man, from reason alone, who only understands something, that | am silent: from faith.

D. M. Luther said on another occasion: "I can no longer work, nor can | speak.

9. in the words of the Last Supper, the Sacramentarians want to make a trope, as ir is a figure to the Loco: Ego sum Vitis vera. 


M. Luther said: "If one wants to make Tropos in this way, then we have lost Christ. It does not apply to trope, one must prove tropos. Muenzer the tropirte with the 3. cap. Johannis, V. 6, also thus: Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua etc. and said:Aqua significat tribulationem, ut in illo loco: Intraverunt in animam meam aquae multae.

But St. Augustine gave a rule, quod Figura et Allegoria nihil probet, sed Historia, Verba et Grammatica, die thun's. Figura does nothing everywhere.

Of the legends of the saints. 


1. from St. Elisabeth. 

2. from the Christian Order. 3. from St. Anna. 

4. st. georgen legend. 


1. from St. Elisabeth. 


Saint Elisabeth was born in 1207, when Emperor Otto and Philip were quarreling and tearing over the Roman Empire. She did not live over four and twenty years of her age. After her death, in the fifth year, she was canonized and proclaimed a saint by Pope Gregory the Ninth. Then she was called by many who knew her and lived during her days. 

He, M. Luther, also read many other things in legends, and said with a sigh: "Oh, how the bishops have slept, and have been so negligent, and have let such errors come into the church! It has been a time of divine wrath that, because the Bible has been lost, such things have been taught. We have now, by God's grace, 


5. from Thecla, the virgins. 6. from St. Christopher legend. 7. from the sacred legends. 


the word. Our Lord God help us. For where God's Word is pure, there must also be the Holy Spirit. 


Then he was asked, "Which legends are canonical, that is, according to the Scriptures, or apocryphal, not according to them? He said, "Very few are pure; the legends of martyrs are least suspect than those who have testified to their faith with their blood. The monks, especially the hermits, who live alone among the people called anachoretes, are marvelous and horrible, for they have many strange, monstrous miracles and foolish works, of wondrous temperance, mortification and discipline. It has the heartache, the flesh can nowhere be rectificiret and brought right. If one rejects the sect of the anachoretes, then desolate, wild, sodomitical 


1346 


But if one praises discipline and a moderate life, then hypocrites and hopefuls become presumptuous people. So there is injustice on both sides. But it is more grievous, as Gerson the teacher says, to sin and to do too much with wasting, than with frugality. For if one does too much with food and drink, he can make up for it with fasting and sickness; but he who breaks off too much with food and drink, and keeps himself too moderate, cannot recover anywhere. | think a lot of the saints, of whom nothing special is known, live in a common way, like other people, without hypocrisy, boast nor let themselves be noticed. 


2nd Christian Order. (Contained in Cap. 26, § 13.) 


3. st. anna. 


They said of St. Anne that she had three husbands. How these verses read: 


Anna solet dici tres concepisse Marias, Quas genuit viro Joachim, Cleophe, Salomeque. This is: 

It is said that Anna gave birth to three Marys to her husbands: Mariam, the mother of the Lord Christ, from Joachim; Mariam Salome from Salome, and Mariam Cleophe from Cleophas; since Salome is a female name. So also of the marriage of John the Evangelist it was said that he was to be the bridegroom of Magdalene; as one sings of him in the Sequence: Thou hast left the sweet breast or thy heart's beloved, and hast followed the Messiah. 

Afterwards, he, D. Martinus, read in a missal of innumerable, many and various masses, which service is arranged and instituted by the pope, only for the sake of money; and said much about the common week, since soon after Michaelmas one held a whole week every day vigils and masses for the dead, sprinkled and burned incense in the charnel house, where the bones of the deceased lay. This was supposed to either alleviate their torment in purgatory or to deliver them from it. All this was believed without, even against God's word. 


Cap. 53. of the legends of the saints. §1-6. 


1347 


4. st. georgen legend. (Contained in Cap. 52, § 4.) 


5. from Thecla, the virgins. 


Doctor M. Luther read the theclen of the virgin legend baptized by St. Paul, that the same should have awakened carnal lust in him. Then he laughed at such lies. Ah, he said, dear Paule, you must have had another stimulum or stake than carnal lust and desire. The monks, who lived in all security and had good days, let them dream after their temptations that St. Paul also had such temptations and was plagued with them, like them, the belly servants. 


6. of St. Christopher's legends. 


Doctor M. Luther preached about St. Christopher on his day, and said that it was no history, but the Greeks, as wise, learned and sensible people, had invented such, to show how a Christian should be, and how he was; namely, a very large, long, strong man, who carries a small child, the JEsulein, on the armpit or shoulder, but is so heavy that he must stoop and bend under it (as the name Christophorus, who carries Christ, indicates) through the raging, wild sea, the world, where the waves and bulges, the tyrants and hordes, together with all the devils, strike at him and persecute, would like to take him for life and limb, property and honor; But he clings to a great tree as to a stick, that is, to the word of God. On the other side of the sea stands an old man with a lantern in which is a burning light, that is, the scriptures of the prophets; he follows them and comes to the shore unharmed, where he is safe, that is, into eternal life; But he has a wetzschker on his side, in which there are fish and bread, to indicate that God also wants to feed his Christians here on earth, in such persecution, crosses and misfortunes, when they have to suffer, and to provide for the body, and not let them die of hunger, as the world would like. Is a beautiful, Christian poem. As also from the knight St. George. For George. 


1348 


in Greek means a builder who builds up land and people with justice and righteousness, and controls and resists the enemies who want to attack and damage them. 


7. from the sacred legends. 


It has been a plague of the devil that we have no Legendam Sanctorum pure. It is the most shameful lies that it is a miracle; and it is a hard work to correct the Legendas Sanctorum. And M. Luther read the same evening the Legenda St. Catharinen and said: This is against all Roman _ histories: because Maxentius 


Cap. 53. Of the legends of the saints. § 6. 7. 





1349 


has drowned in the Tiber at Rome, and has never come to Alexandria; but Maximius has been there, as one reads in the Eusebio; and since the times of Julli Caesaris, and long before, no king has been Egypt. It must have been a desperate villain who thus vexed Christendom with such mendaciis, he must certainly be deep in hell. We believed such portents and should not have rebelled against them if we had already understood them, but we did not fail to do so. Therefore thank our Lord God, you young fellows, and be pious, so that you do not have to believe such things or even more shameful things.

1. what is the use of concilia. 


In 1533, on the 21st day of March, the emperor's legate came to Luther's house in Wittenberg. M. Luther's house to Wittenberg, desired to see him, as he had orders from his lord to all princes and lords of the German nation. But he did not see D. L. Then M. Hausmann asked him: Where is the Imperial Majesty now? He said, "At Mantua, where he had long been dealing with the pope for the sake of the Concilii, so that one could

30. what the papists are looking for. 

31. M. Ph. Melanchthon's concerns were announced by the Pope's legate to the Elector of Saxony, Duke John Frederick. 


One of them was supposed to set it and write it out; but the pope would have excused himself for a long time, and would have postponed the matter a bit, and would have delayed answering. But when the emperor finally stopped with diligence, the pope wanted to determine a certain place; the pope would have secretly gone away, leaving the emperor there. 

Then said D. M. Luther, when it was pointed out to him: "The pope is a rogue and a villain. | have always hated a concilium: 


1350 


Not that our doctrine should be confirmed and ratified, for it has always been given and ratified by another, namely by God Himself, but only that in external things and ceremonies a unity and reformation might be made. But nothing comes of it. 

Therefore, let no one be so foolish as to put people off until a future concilium. God's word is to be the foundation of our faith, on which we are to base ourselves and rely. It is also uncertain about the concilium. How many hundreds of thousands of people die before one is held? Therefore, people should be led by God's word and will, not by the concilium. 

And just in the same year 1533, imperial legates were sent to the Elector of Saxony, H[archduke] John Frederick, to schedule a concilium; to which an answer was also given by S. C. F. G.: They wanted to appear with certain conditions, either personally, or through their envoys and advisors, since they were sufficiently assured of escort, and it would be a Christian free concilium 2c. 


(The following Lauterbach, June 27, 1538, p. 91.) 

On June 27, D. Luther and Mag. Philipp dined together in his house at a deposition. 1) They sighed and said many things about the future time when they would have many teachers. There will be a great confusion. No one will want to be governed by another's teaching or reputation. Everyone will want to be his own rabbi, like Osiander and Agricola, and from this will come the greatest annoyances and divisions. Therefore it would have been best that the princes had preceded by a concilium, if the fugitive papists had not so feared the light. To this Mag’. Philip sadly replied: "The pope will never be brought to a general concilium, he acts against us only by force and cunning. Therefore it is said that Nicolaus of Schoenberg, bishop of Capua, admonished the pope with the best of reasons that he should take up the matter of the church honestly and concede something to the Germans, that he should also not use his prestige against the 


1) On deposition, see Cap. 67, §§ 6 and 7. 


Cap. 54. Of the concilia. § 1-3. 





1351 


Germans; for they would be such people who would not yield in a just, honorable cause, and could not be overcome either by force or by cunning. But the pope despised this very pious advice of his. Oh, that our princes and estates would establish a concilium and a harmony in doctrine and ceremonies, so that each one would not break out with his audacity to the annoyance of many. As it already appears. It is indeed a very pitiful image of the church, which lies hidden under so much weakness and trouble. 


2 The Pope's and the Cardinals’ humble letter to the King's preachers (Lauterbach, Aug. 23, 1538, p. 118.) 

Luther read the letters of the Cardinals and the Pope to Frederick Nausea, the preacher of Ferdinand, in which they humbly asked and admonished Nausea to assemble a council and accused the Lutherans as if they prevented it. He answered: "They themselves do not want a council, and none should be assembled, because they would have destroyed us before. In the past, the Cardinals would have considered it beneath their dignity to write to such an insignificant man, but now they pay homage to him because they do not have a good conscience; now they have to pay what they owed to the dear Christ. O Lord, you are just, and right is your judgment. May your name be sanctified and not ours. 


3. not to be provided with a concilii. (Lauterbach, Aug. 24, 1538, p. 119.) 

On August 24, he said: "At this time there can be no concilium, for the pope flees judgment and the immodesty of others hinders it. Behold, how great reverence and modesty there was at the Council of Nicaea, where such a large assembly gave way to one Paphnutius, who said that the chastity of attendance was greater than the sanctity of celibacy! Such words | would never have dared to sayu: chastity in attendance; but would have said: in marriage. But Heb. 13 (v. 4.) says: "The marriage bed undefiled." Now, if a hundred people like Paphnutius were to resist, they would ver-. 


1352 


because the Pope would conclude: Our Council is holy and the Catholic Church, which cannot err and must not yield to anyone. 


4, the Pabst's fame. 


The pope writes and boasts that he is a bishop of the Catholic Church, a title he was never allowed to give him before. For in the Concilio Niceno there was no pope at all, at that time the church was divided into three parts: First, Aethiopiam, the land of the Moors; second, Syria, which included Antioch. The third part was Rome with its associated cities. Soon after the time of the apostles they swarmed and established and ordered three kinds of concilia: 1. common or general; 2. provincial; 3. and diocesan, that is, which should be held in each diocese as far as its sprengwedels reach. 


5. what happened in Salzburg, when it was suggested by the Concilio. 


The archbishop of Salzburg had many bishops, about eight hundred persons, summoned and called together, and as they were conferring in the church of the Concilio, a great storm and thunderclap with lightning drove them away from each other, so that one ran out here, the other out there; after that, in the castle, the same thing happened again, and when they came together again, the thunder chased them away and scattered them. 


6. the extension of the concilii. (Lauterbach, Dec. 18, 1538, p. 194.) 


On this day a printed note was brought about the postponement of the Council until the month of May, in which the most impudent lies were under the title and name of God. Luther said: Do not deny yourself to death. Rome and the Pope are greater in wickedness than the greatest eloquence can utter. No one believes it who has not experienced it. (Sil. Ital. Punic. VII, 395.) How the pope holds sway over the church and wants to build it from accidental things, namely according to outward appearance and success! But we want to judge the church according to the will, according to the word of God and the sacraments. 


1) lronic instead of "Sprengel". 


Cap. 54. Of the concilia. § 3-7. 


1353 


May the pope boast of the council. But he omitted to bind the kings by oaths. In short: The Pope is kept for the judgment of God, therefore he is already strangled by the word of God. Duke George and others, also the King of. England, hate the Pope personally, but not in reality; they keep the soul of the Pope and kill only the body (Luc. 12, 4. f.). The pope can well stand this; after twenty years he hopes for his kingdom again. But we attack the Pope's soul with the word of God, we consider his body to be nothing, we do not pluck it, like Duke George and the King of England, but seek his throat, we want to put the goose on the spit. If you pluck it right away, it will soon quail again. That is why the devil hates us who strangle the pope. So does the king of Denmark, who is after the pope's soul. 


7. four most distinguished concilia. 


Anno 1'539, the 27th of January, D. M. Luther had a book in his hand, whose title was Liber Conciliorum, a book of concilia, in which he found sixty general and provincial concilia, held from the time of the apostles; among which four were the most noble and praiseworthy: Two defended the Trinity and Divinity of Christ, as the Nicene and Constantinopolitan; but two the humanity of Christ, as that at Ephesus and Chalcedon. 

In the Concilio of Nicaea nothing is written about the bishop of Rome, that one had been there. Only one, Hosius, 2) Bishop of Corduba from Hispania, was there; the other bishops came from the churches in the Orient, as from Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Africa 2c. Oh dear Lord God, the bishops' concilia and convent, what are they but only vain ambition and money, where they quarrel about titles, session and other loose childish puppet work? Look at what has been discussed at the conventicles for three hundred years so far, only about external things and ceremonies, nothing about right godly doctrine, right worship and faith. 


2) In the editions Ozius; Stangwald: Osius. 


1354 


Cap. 54. of the concilia. § 8-11. 


1355 





8. what concilio have to order. 


When M. Luther had in his hands the book of concilia, which had been compiled and made with great effort and labor, he said: "This whole book wants to defend the pope, since there are countless canons against the pope in his decrees. Above this, the Concilia have no power to make laws and order what is to be taught and believed in the church, nor of good works, as they have been taught and confirmed beforehand; but have only power to make order of outward things, customs and ceremonies: but no further, than as far as persons, places and time are concerned: when these are no longer and cease, then such orders are also no longer anything, but dead and abolished. 

The Roman laws are now gone and dead, because Rome is no longer, but has been. For now it is another place. So also the "conciliar decrees" and ordinances are no more, because now it is another time. So St. Paul says Col. 2, 20. ff: "Why do you let yourselves be caught by statutes, as if you were still living in the world? Who say, Thou shalt not touch this, thou shalt not taste that, thou shalt not touch that. Which are all consumed with hands, and are the commandment and doctrine of men. Which have a semblance of wisdom, through self-chosen spirituality and humility: and in that they spare not the body, and do not honor the flesh for its need." Therefore the conscience does not bind such "decrees" and statutes, which are directed and set to person, time and place. For as the three, person, place, and time, cease and are changed, so also such ordinances are changed and cease. Such doctrines want to make an immortal man out of a mortal man; just as they have also called the pope an earthly god, and very properly and rightly so: for all his laws, rights, and ordinances taste of earth, not of heavenly things. 

Truly, itis a great blindness that binds consciences to trust and build on it, since Christ clearly and clearly says Luc. 17:20: "The kingdom of God is a kingdom of God. 


Do not come with outward gestures." The statutes, which are directed and set to person, place and time, are more political and domestic than to the church: they belong more to the secular and domestic regiment than to the church. 


9. from human traditions. 


Doct. Martin Luther once said that an Augustinian monk, Andreas Proles, Doctoris Staupitii Antecessor, an excellent learned man and fine preacher, would have said of the human statutes and the sophistical disputationibus: that such disputations reminded him of the same thing as if one were sitting and sharpening an axe, and he always sharpened and sharpened it, and yet never cut anything with it. By which similitude he meant to indicate that such disputations 1) can nowhere be used, but are mere words, and nothing else. 


10. comparison of the divine Word and the Fathers’ Scriptures. 


Item, this Andreas Proles used to say about the divine word, if one wants to interpret, interpret and gloss it through the fathers: When the word of God comes to the fathers, it reminds me the same, as if a milk comes through a coal bag, because the milk must become black and spoiled. In this way, he wanted to make it understood that God's word in himself was pure and clear, bright and clear enough, but through the fathers' teachings, books and writings it was very darkened, distorted and corrupted. 


11 Of the Concilio of Nicaea. 


The Concilium of Nicaea was, after the time of the Apostles, the very best and purest; but soon after, in the time of the Emperor Constantine, it was weakened by the Arians: for the Arians then signed themselves deceitfully, out of a false heart, as if they were of one mind with the righteous Catholic teachers; but it was nothing, and fictitious thing, they only put themselves thus in words, as if they were of one mind and understanding.

secular, come together, so that the pure doctrine of the faith is preserved and the church is swept and cleansed from new errors and heresies. Thus, many bishops come together as if to extinguish a common fire, since everyone, especially the chiefs and common watchmen, should rush to help. Therefore, they should not burden the church with new statutes, but purify it and punish the ungodly, heretics and false teachers. They may order ceremonies that are useful and good, but so far that they remain free and the consciences are not bound or entangled by them. 

Thus the Concilium of Nicaea and Ephesus (which were almost the best) did not regulate anything about faith and works, as they were sufficiently and abundantly indicated and taught before in the holy Scriptures; but only purified the Church from the great labominable heresy of Arii, which was a common fire ‘and poison, against the article of the holy Trinity. At that time the dear holy fathers and bishops did not first make the article of the divinity of Christ, but purified it When it was believed before. However, some ceremonies may well be ordered, but not in the opinion that they should remain common and eternal, nor that they should see and entangle the consciences; rather, they should be left free, as secular and domestic orders. 


The papists boast and defy the concilia very much, since they do not agree, but are often against each other; so that one cannot compare them well, nor agree. Many of the same argue and are most vehemently against the papists. Therefore, whoever runs them diligently and has respect for them, he will find three different times of the conciliarities. 

The first is from the time of the Apostles until Gregory the First, which was still somewhat pure: although it had to tolerate and suffer many human things from time to time, it was still tolerable. The other time, from the first Gregory to Carolum Magnum. At that time, the pope was a spiritual lord, leading all kinds of superstition and superstition. The third period, from Carolo Magno, has been the worst and most harmful, since the Pope has taken both swords and has become an earthly god and a worldly lord in the whole Christendom. Therefore, if one respects the canons of the third time, one must say that it is all diabolical; for they have made order and law according to their liking, as they have only ventilated it, so that no one may protest against it, nor speak anything. 


13, what a proper concilium is and why it should be held. 


The pope has arrogated to him that he is over the concilium, and has power to make articles of faith. Item, to order of good works and services, which

The meeting held at Nuremberg in 1532 did not please M. Luther at all, for he said: "The papists are using cunning and trickery only to oppress us and to smear our mouths, and they seek and want nothing less than that a reformation should be made.

Schmalkalden and have let them go out publicly by printing. For if we were to enter into treaties and settlements with them for the sake of external peace, we would shatter the pure doctrine of our church and make it suspect and doubtful, as it should not be bent with certainty, but like a reed, according to the circumstances. O no, not to me the comparison. If Emperor Carl set up a national council, something could still be hoped for; but it will not go away either. The papists should not give way, and only sit in it alone, and have the power to close it. 

Then Philip said, "So it is decided at Frankfort, although it is hard to argue about it. If the papists or the cardinals were to come, and they alone would have the power to sit in it and close it, we would all rise up against it, for the pope shall have neither authority nor power in it. 

D. M. Luther saw well that it was the bishop of Mainz, Albrecht's, poem and gear, therefore he said: We do not need a concilii for the sake of the divine word; for that is certain, about which one should neither dispute nor deliberate. Only it is to be done for the sake of external things. We can do the fasting without concilium. For this | will gladly do in the market, but without entangling the consciences, which should be free and not burdened or bound by it. For Christ has not instituted nor commanded fasts by law, but saith Marc. 2:20: "When therefore the bridegroom is taken from them, then shall they fast." Matth. 19, 21: "Go and sell all that you have" 2c. So then fasting is well found. 


17. from the Concilio. 


D. Gregorius Briick, Chancellor of Saxony, sent M. Luther a new newspaper from the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530, how the Pope, through his legate and nephew, Farnesius, the Cardinal, had strongly urged the Emperor not to give peace to the protesting estates, because they had previously agreed to the concilium. But when the emperor refused him, Farnesius, in disguise, suddenly and hurriedly 


of it. However, the emperor would have ordered the protesters to try whether they wanted to join the concilium, which the pope himself had announced from his power; and he wanted to persuade them to do so, because he did not want to applaud the pope's errors. 

The protesters, however, discussed and considered the greatness of this deal and the pope's wickedness, also considered the emperor suspicious: they could not be persuaded nor brought to agree to it and to grant the pope so much that he should have power, right and authority to describe and assemble a council, even to be part and judge with it, and finally to conclude it at his pleasure: The pope and the pope's family, who were in favor of the Granvellen, asked that learned, understanding people from both parts be appointed to such a great, high, important matter, who would have voces decisivas and the power to conclude it. 

When Granvel insisted that the protesters were not even one, that they had many sects among them. But they denied it, rejected it and said: There were no sects among them, but they were united, and taught simple, Christian and unanimous from one heart and with one mouth, without some delusion and error of the Anabaptists, Sacramentarians and_ other enthusiasts and red spirits. They had therefore rejected many objections, persuasiones and proposals, which the Granvel had endeavored to persuade them, and had proposed the emperor as a kind mediator, who had offered to be a good, cheap slider in the matter, and would not easily overreach them and wage war against them for the sake of religion. 2c. 

Over all this D. M. Luther was astonished. M. Luther said: "It can be seen that the emperor acts with the pope as one cretin with another, in a vixen-like manner; he sees through his fingers to disgrace the pope; and so that he would not be considered as sleeping or slumbering, he sought means on both parts to compare them with each other. But there is no way to advise our people that they should commit themselves with oaths to accept what the pope decides against God and his word.

They will not bring it there again, neithe by congresses, nor by conciliation, however wise an learned they may be. May the merciful God preserv what He has wrought in us: the matter is His, and no ours. May God grant that we also be faithful an grateful for this revelation. The Pope has promised th Emperor through this legate to give a hundre thousand crowns against the Turk. This is called th birds grained. 


19. from the Concilio. 


If a concilium is held in another way, said Luther, th papists will have their 


unity! but no means can be devised for this. For if the pope were to recognize himself in the obvious articles and the grossest, most palpable errors and submit to the concilium, he would lose his prestige, because he has prided himself as the head of the church, to whom all members must obey. Therefore, they accuse the Council of Constance of having arrogated to itself a prestige over the pope. Therefore, if they concede us the least article, the hanger on the wreath is broken, and all will cry out: Is it not said that the pope, the head of the church, cannot err? This is the principle and the main point of the Pabstium. As Sylvester Prierias, the master of the sacred palace [Magister sacri palatii], wanted to frighten me with this flash, saying: Whoever doubts a word or work of the Roman Church is a heretic. At that time | was still weak. | did not want to attack the pope. | honored such reasons. But now | will write from the Concilium and will give this advice to the emperor, that he should give full freedom to the Roman pope to set and decide what pleases him. This is the best way to get to the point 


1364 


come. As little as the Pope can hand over, so little can | let up, because it is God's word. 


21) When the right concilium would be held. 


D. M. Luther asked at one time: Quando Papa esset convocaturus Concilium? One of them answered: The Concilium should be held and begin on all Holy Days. Then M. Luther answered: | let myself think that nothing would come of it before the last day, until our Lord God Himself holds a concilium. He had understood that the right day of all saints would be the last day, when all saints would rise from the dead and enter into eternal life with Christ. 


22. a different from the Concilio. (Lauterbach, Feb. 3, 1538, p. 24.) 

The Elector said to me today about the future Concilium: What do we want to offend the Pope much? Let him make the Concilium at Rome, or wherever he wants, conclude what he wants, because if he admits us much, he will let up some cold, external ceremonies of blessed water, salt, palms, fasting, they will also not defend their celibate life much, but they will not admit the article of justification and of the mass. For as long as the mass stands, Luther is damned; if the mass falls, the whole foundation of the pope collapses. That is why they hold so firmly over the mass. As Campegius said at Augsburg, he would rather be torn to pieces than give up the mass. Truly, it is a horrible wickedness to hold so tightly to what, in their own judgment, are only human flimsinesses. 


23. the Papist fraud of the Concilio. 

(Lauterbach, March 29, 1538, p. 50.) Then he mentioned the fictitious concilium at Vincenz, since it was written from Padua, which was only three miles away, that there was no talk of the concilium and no preparation for it. The boys are not serious. For they know that no king or duke can enter the territory of the Venetians. 


Cap. 54. of the concilia. § 20-24. 





1365 


will. Ah, they burned themselves at the Constance Council, where it was decided that the pope was under the Council. What have they done during the hundred years of chattering to keep this article: the pope cannot be mistaken, he is above the council; so that some have brazenly dared to doubt it, one does not know whether the pope is God or man! Just look, | beg you, at the miraculous artifices of the pope at the Council of Basle, twelve years after the Council of Constance, where the emperor and the cardinals forced the Council, but the pope Eugenius resisted in every way that it should not happen. He cannot and does not like it. | would resist myself if | were in his place. 


24. as would like to be acted in the Concilio. (The first paragraph of this § in Kummer p. 366 [Lauterbach, p. 82, note]). 

Therefore, there is no hope for a true council, because the pope does not suffer a reformation, but reserves all authority for himself at the council. There are two voices at the council; one is a consultative or deliberative one, which all princes, kings and teachers have. The other is a decisive one, which only the pope and some cardinals have, and they simply decide according to their will. | am worried that we will never again come so close together as at Augsburg. These are terrifying times, and at last we will come to the cross, that we may be killed according to the flesh and not be proud, and He will be with us until the end of the world. 

If the emperor despairs of the Council and sees that nothing will come of it, he will hold a Diet and perhaps not summon our princes, but will condemn them as disobedient and want to be executor. If, however, he dares to defend the pope's public scoundrels, he will be the most wretched and unfortunate; even though the pope, as a clever, treacherous fellow, poses as if he would like to have a concilium and be reformed. There will be a great clamor and indignation if the emperor wants to execute us, who are under ban at Worms and Augsburg. 


1366 


| fear that the emperor will then have lost all favor and good will in Germany; for he has treated the Germans badly, has not dealt with them in a princely manner; he will not be accepted with such humility as has hitherto been the case. And even if he brings a warrior nation and a bunch of Spaniards, he will not be able to force and subjugate Germany in such a dissolute way. Hitherto he has overcome with his kindness, and has been mighty over her; but the Spaniards’ cruelty and tyranny are insufferable. So even our princes will not help him against the Turk, but say: Lord Emperor, give us peace. Therefore, a great uprising and rebellion is to be feared. But God will avert it. Therefore, let us pray diligently, God has something great in mind and will inflict punishment if we do not mend our ways. 


25 A different one from the Concilio. 1) 


About the Concilium. In our time there is a great rumor that a council is to be assembled, which the papists do not like. For at the Council of Constance three popes were deposed and the fourth confirmed on condition that he be under the authority of the Council. The pope at Rome cannot stand this decision, but he boasts of the argument very much and stands on it: church, church, and it cannot err, as the Jews were proud under the title of the people of God. The papists alone want to be the church without the word of God and against the word of God; and we are not the church, although the clear text says Matth. 18: "Where two or three are gathered together in my name", which is a testimony for us; on the other hand, the most violent thunderclap against the papists Matth. 10: "He who hears you hears me", as if he wanted to say: The church cannot be without hearing and the word. 

Anno 1538, the 12th of August, D. M. Luther spoke of Concilien, how the Concilium at Costnitz would have the authority, prestige, power

1367 


and power of the pope were greatly weakened: for then three popes would have been deposed and the fourth elected, and it would have been decided and decreed that the concilium would be over the pope. There is a bar put in front of them, so that the pope does not long for the concilium. That is why the papists have worked these one hundred and twenty years with the greatest diligence, and have endeavored to raise the authority and power of the pope above the concilium. He is afraid of it, flees from it as the devil from incense, as they say. He will never make a concilium unless the emperor and the princes call for it; for the papacy is falling by leaps and bounds, and is gradually falling into disgrace. First the mendicant orders fell, then the princely monasteries; now the monasteries and bishoprics are perishing. Heli wants to sink. 2) For four kingdoms in Europe, England, Germany, Denmark and Hungary, have fallen away from the papacy; the others hold very little. For the patrons of the pope, because they have swallowed his thunder and lightning, the decree bull, will strip the papacy bare and flay it, and pull the skin over its ears: as now Duke George is snatching the ecclesiastical and church goods to himself; and will not allow money for annals, pallia 2c. to be led to Rome. So the pope will lose money and. will lose power. 

And | am heartily pleased that it is done so neatly that he does not bring it to himself with the sword and war, as happened in Bohemia; but proceeds peacefully, with the chancery and reckoning pennies, as F[erdinand] and the Bishop of Mainz, and H[erzog] Georg do. The belly of the pope will pine away. But this is to be pitied, that the church goods are devoured and eaten under them, and the parishes and scholarships are left abandoned and unprovided for; which, however, our Lord and Prince and other princes do not do, but decree that religion be preserved; although it cannot happen in the same way. But those eat it up with skin and hair, and nevertheless pursue religion.

the measure of the pope. The fact that his dignity and majesty are despised is more bitter to him than death; they cannot help it now. After that, the pope humbled himself to some extent and wrote to the Elector, even to Spalatin and Pfeffinger, insisting that they should give me away and see to it that his order was carried out on me, and he wrote to the Elector this sentence: "Although you are unknown to me, according to your person, | have seen your father Ernst here in Rome, a very obedient son of the Church, who attended our services quite devoutly, and | wish that your Serenity would follow in his footsteps." But the Elector noticed this unusual humility of the Pope and his evil conscience that he was afraid, and saw the efficacy of the Scriptures. For my theses ran in very few days almost through all Europe. Thus the Elector was encouraged not to carry out their orders, but submitted to the Scriptures. If the Cardinal of Augsburg had acted more modestly and accepted me when | asked him, it would never have come to this. For at that time | knew little of the errors of the pope. If he had kept silent, | would have kept silent easily. For this was the Roman usage in some dark and inextricable matter, that the pope said: We take this matter to ourselves out of papal authority and strike it down completely. Then both parts were forced to be silent. | think the pope would give three cardinals for it, that it would be in these: Barrel would be where it was then.

The Diet of Augsburg is worthy of all praise, for at it the Gospel became known to the world; both the emperor and the pope heard it. What money is consumed there, no one shall regret. 3) 

In order to spread His Gospel, God willed that the Diet of Augsburg be held, for they stole away to this Diet. They publicly approved our doctrine and did not dare to call us heretics, but schismatics, since we call them antichrists and an abomination before God. We have passed this verdict.

come. But we ask nothing of the world, for its sake we have not begun it, neither will we leave it [for its sake], but for Christ's sake | have dared this, for He also for my sake has dared something on Good Friday. 

The papists had persuaded the emperor that our doctrine should be inconsistent, and when he would come, he would call them all silent, so that no one would be allowed to say a word. But things turned out much differently. For ours freely confessed the gospel before the emperor and the whole empire, and put the opponents, the papists, to the highest shame in the same imperial diet. 

Item: The Diet of Augsburg is not to be paid for with any money, for the sake of the confession of the faith and word of God, which was made by our people there: for there the adversaries had to confess that our confession was right and true. 


4. the Confession and Apologia delivered to the Emperor at Augsburg. (Cordatus No. 794.) 


This emperor is given to us as a gift from God; indeed, everyone should faithfully pray for him. Although he has ruled until now with great happiness, he has the greatest enemies, the Pope, the Venetians, the King of France, [the King] of England 2c., and in the matter of religion he has judged much differently than he was advised by the papists, and has sent our Apology and Confession to all universities. Of course, this was the opinion of his advisors: His Imperial Majesty should put all his power against it, if this Confession were against Christian faith; but if it were against the abuses, he should order it to learned people. This was certainly wise counsel, and Eck said that he could not refute our doctrine with Scripture. Yes, the Mainzer said: O how finely our scholars defend us! But | know that this [his statement] is sincere, for he is courting the pope, and Duke Jurge [Georg] has gone too far into the no and cannot go back. Of those who oppose us, Eck, Cochlaus, we care for 


We are not concerned about anyone, but only about the emperor, to whom our cause has been submitted; if he writes against us, our duke will answer. The emperor and the pope resist our confession. We will wait for him; we are not interested in the others. 


5. the use and power of the Augsburg Confession and Apology. (Cordatus No. 1268.) 


The Diet of Augsburg is in truth the last trumpet before the last judgment and a certain judge, because God's word is made all the brighter the more it is fought against; for now our confession has been sent out by the emperor himself to all princes and universities. But the Confutation of the adversaries, in what darkness it lies hidden! Oh, if it were to come out, how we would want to get on the old torn fur, but they hate the light. 


6 Of the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530. M. Luther's Opinion. 

On the day of Viti, which was Monday, the 8th after Trinity, 1) in the evening after dinner, M. Luther said in his garden, among others, this, in the presence of M. Hausmann, Cordati and Schlainhaufen, and said: "Let us put the matter home to God, he knows how to do it. Now a year ago, not a penny would have been given for all Lutherans or Protestants, so certainly the wicked already had us. For since my lord Duke John, the Elector of Saxony, came to the Diet before other princes: they did not believe that he should come out; they all let themselves believe that his cause was too evil, that he should not be allowed to come out with it. 2) 


1) There is an error in this date. Vitus is June 15; but the 8th Sunday after Trinity cannot already fall in June. This speech must have been made not long after the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. But only in the year 1534 Vitus falls on a Monday, namely after the 2nd Sunday after Trinity. 

2) Similar content Cordatus No. 640: Duke Georg will not give up the wish to be Elector until he dies; therefore, he now hurries to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, as he did earlier to Innsbruck, since he has never been received by the Emperor, because he did not want to lend his ear to anyone, so that he would keep himself impartial. 


1378 


But what happens? Now, in their greatest security, the greatest terror overtakes them. Because M. G. Herr, the Elector of Saxony, comes so early to Augsburg as a pious, obedient Christian prince, the other princes, Duke Georg, Margrave Joachim, hurry to Innsbruck. There was a heated discussion about what it would mean if the Elector of Saxony went to the Imperial Diet so early. And so, the emperor was also afraid of the matter, whether he would safely come to and from the Diet. Then the princes promised to leave their goods and blood with the emperor's majesty, and to keep six thousand horses and so many servants, so that there would be no need. There one sees a miracle that is great among the great miracles, that God makes the enemies of truth fearful and timid. The pious prince is alone, and only the hundredth sheep, but he is nine and ninety, and yet they fidget and are fearful. 

When it came to the entry and the action, a small group was seen at the Word of God, but they brought with them a strong king, above all emperors and kings, who was called the Word of God. But all the world cried out: O, it is far too small that such a small group should stand against imperial power! But | will not yet say what has been accomplished, for the Lord makes void the counsel of princes. Pilate had power, but would not kill Christ. Annas and Caiphas would have liked to do it, but could not. The emperor is still pious, but the bishops, cardinals 2c. are peelers. 

But now the pious emperor does not want to wash his hands in innocent blood, the mad princes fall down, reproach, disgrace and despise the emperor in the worst way. So the pope comes along, wanting to burst with fury, so that it will happen without presilience and bloodshed, and he leads the way and sends the sword to N., who is to execute it; but he is to do it and will not win it, and he intends to take the emperor's crown and put it on N. N., because he is the one who is to do the things right. 

So God sent princes and lords, and the pope, to fall away from the emperor, and 


Cap. 55. Of imperial assemblies and conventions 2c. §6.7. 


1379 


we fall to him. If this is not a miracle, God's destiny, | am surprised that the one whom the devil wanted to use against us, our God takes him and uses him for us. Miracle above all miracles. In sum, God enlightens the pious emperor from day to day with His dear Word, amen. 


7 Of the day at Brunswick in 1538 in Lent, Dominica Latare. (Lauterbach, 5 Avr. 1538, p. 56 and 10 Apr. 1538, p. 60.) 


On this day, news had come of the meeting in Brunswick, how the Elector had traveled for six days through the Mark, since he had not been granted a safe escort by Henry of Brunswick. He had been treated very honorably by the Elector, the Margrave, and many had come to meet him from Brunswick and had received him humbly. The landgrave, however, broke through Goslar from the other side without an escort. It was written that the King of Denmark had made a glorious profession of faith the next day, and was praised as a second David. Luther answered: God help him and the holy covenant to sanctify his name. However, that insolence of the Duke of Brunswick can become a little spark of displeasure, since he, against right and equity, has denied a safe conduct to those who were once his best friends. For Moses also requested a safe conduct from the kings of the Amorites, 2c. but since they refused it, he had a cause of war against them. O Lord God, give peace and tranquility. (Deut. 21, 21. ff. Deut. 2, 26. ff.) - Luther asked several times on this journey for rain for the land: HErr GOtt, geben unseren Kindern und unserem Gesinde das tagliche Brod, siehe uns vaterlich an. 

On that day news came from Brunswick; for it was written that the King of Denmark was present, a legation from the King of England and from many cities, some of which were very peevish about making an alliance. Luther said: They seek their own under that. 


1380 


name of the gospel, but in dangers they fear for themselves. This political association has nothing to do with the gospel. It is God who preserves and defends in persecution; let us trust Him and make an eternal covenant with Him. The world is the world. 


8 The Convention and Meeting of the Protesting Estates at Frankfurt am Main 1539, 


The merciful God, said D. Luther, help them now in Frankfurt to deliberate and decide in a Christian and pure manner, so that God's honor and the salvation and benefit of Christendom may be promoted. It is a small imperial Diet, it can be seen as very simple, and it has an evil appearance to hold a day and a meeting in an imperial city. But because they are provoked and forced to do so by the adversaries, they have to do it. 

The papists insolently and untrustworthily 

subordinate themselves to seize and take the cities by trickery: they provoke ours with deceit. Then they pretend to make and keep peace, but in the meantime they intend to cut up the whole body and slaughter the members: they secretly attack Hamburg, Minden and Frankfurt. They would do more wisely if they attacked us publicly with war. They have publicly condemned us at Augsburg, and if our people had not been so patient, it would soon have begun there. On February 16, Luther ordered that one wanted to ask with seriousness for the day in Frankfurt, which is probably a small imperial diet, that peace be made. For if the Landgrave is to burn, there is no more defense. As happened to me and M. Philippo: when we humbly and faithfully advised him against the war, he said to us: "How, 


Cap. 55. Of imperial assemblies and conventions 2c. § 7. 8. 


1381 


if | gave you advice and | didn't? 

It is a miracle of God, and he is a hero: how a weak prince he otherwise is, but one is afraid of him. He has rightly chased the bishops to the choir, and he will now speak with them in the gate, so that the papists will either have to do harm or suffer, either keep silent and sit still, or give peace. 

The landgrave does not provoke, nor does he give cause to provoke, but after he has been provoked and given cause, he seeks peace; whether he has a better horse in 2000 horses: for Hesse and Saxony are horsemen, when they sit in the saddle, they are not easily frightened; the horsemen of the Oberland are dancing juniors. God keep us the landgrave, for there is much in one man. | would rather be in an army and a troop of deer, where a lion is the supreme commander, than in an army and a troop of lions, where a deer is supreme, Emperor Augustus used to say. 

On February 25, M. Luther asked with serious words and prayers for peace and for the day at Frankfurt, so that religion, police and economy, God's word, secular and domestic regiment, do not get mixed up and fail through internal and domestic wars, which are the most harmful. For war pleases those who have not tried it nor experienced it. God protect us from it. Men of war are now devils in the flesh, not only the Spaniards, but also the Germans. Nulla fides pietasque viris, qui castra sequuntur, says the pagan poet. 

No loyalty, faith nor godliness is with men of war at this time. 

For the very things that should protect us would corrupt and afflict us the most.

7. what spiritual goods can be used for. 


1. concerns of D. M. Luther of church properties. 


My advice and concern has always been to let the monasteries and dioceses remain, for the benefit and use of poor students and schools. Since a dean or provost would not or could not preach at the monastery himself, he would transfer other pupils and students who are qualified for this, and let them study and preach at his expense. But if the princes and lords seize the spiritual goods and want to starve the poor students, then the parishes will become desolate, as it is already happening. Neither parish priests nor deacons can be obtained. If we had a hundred theologians here, what would it be among so many countries? 


2. a pious matron's Christian testament. 


A pious matron in W. 2) had put her house and farm in common boxes, from which 25 gulden were to be given annually to a poor student who was studying: in the fifth year, however, it was to be given to a poor virgin as dowry and dowry. This is a fine, Christian testament, said D. God will ever provide and give even more, if we would only be pious. The pope, even though he is our mortal enemy, must nourish us, even against his will and thanks; even though he rages and rages against us, but the emperor will not do the execution.

3. deprivation of church property. (Lauterbach, Aug. 14, 1538, p. 113.) 

The robbery of all bishops and princes and the church goods was mentioned. When _ they complained about this, the doctor said: "It is a very bad time, because the church is neglected, nothing is given to it, but it is robbed. Once the kings and princes strengthened it, but now they rob it; for the church hangs more tattered than any beggar's cloak. Nothing is added to the sustenance of the poor and the church servants, but those who scatter to the right use suffer persecution; [it] will happen to them as it happened to St. Lawrence, who distributed the goods of the church among the poor against the emperor's command. 


4. clerical goods whore wages. (Lauterbach, Nov. 17, 1538, p. 174.) 

Then it was said of the misfortune of King Ferdinand, who had eloquence and various other gifts in abundance, but because he was hostile to the Gospel and adhered to the papists, he was very unhappy. For he would receive a cardinal with him at very great expense, a useless man, since he could feed many very learned people with the same effort. Luther answered: The church goods under the papacy are not worthy of a pious use; they are gathered from whores' wages (Micha 1, 7.) and also return to it. 2) 


2) Cf. cap. 27, 2 36. 


1384 


5. tearing of the lords for spiritual goods. (Lauterbach, Nov. 23, 1538, p. 178.) 


On November 23, he spoke several things about future disunity of princes. For all kings and princes have their eye on the church estates and each will try to seize the bishoprics and the best monasteries, and will scramble for the spoils, none will want to miss. For the sooner he is there in time, the better is his right. Oh, they are beautiful brides, Magdeburg, Mainz, Trier, Cologne, Wurzburg, so there is still a dance to be done. That is why the papists urge ours to surrender, so that they will have all the better to scuffle about until the pope is bald. | will diligently pray to God that He will not let me experience this time. These will be terrible times. For all dukes also wish to be defenders of the pope, so that they may have his power. And so the pope will be a prey of the nations according to the words of Revelation (19, 17. f.): "Come, you birds of the air, feed on flesh. 


6. pope buys him the high potentates to friends with the church estates. (Lauterbach, Nov. 25, 1538, p. 180.) 

After that he said about the foolishness of the pope, who allowed the emperor, [King] Ferdinand and other princes to plunder the church goods in the hope that by this permission he would maintain his 


Cap. 56. of ecclesiastical or church property. § 5-8. 


1385 


will never be built. Now the prophecy is fulfilled in Revelation 17 (v. 16) that the kings will strip that beast bare and rob it. The papacy was a prey and will become a prey. Twelve years ago, the pope allowed Ferdinand to rob even the bishoprics, which had to be loosed. After that, at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, it was announced to him that he should return those properties. Now he [the pope] admits it again. King Ferdinand may well swear with his sons [sunen] 1) against the gospel, if the pope only allows him [the robbery]. It is a very strange time, which we would not have thought of twenty years ago. For the pope, who was a terrible idol, is forced. He is forced to endure defiance and disgrace from his princes, since thirty years ago none of the emperors would have dared to offend him with a single word. Summa Summarum: The papists have the worst intentions. God forbid them. Let us only pray diligently through Christ. 


7. what spiritual goods can be used for. 


D. Martinus was asked whether a student could in good conscience have a canonry or vicarage, that is, the income from it, and use it for study. Then he said, "A poor student can certainly have church goods and use them for study, but only that he does not allow himself to be bound and entangled with ungodly and unchristian vows, and does not consent to nor have fellowship with the papists' errors. Oh, if we could get 


reputation with them. Thus he wrote to the King of|the seventh part of this skirt, the church goods, for the 


England that he would gladly grant him the church goods if he only acknowledged that he was the highest priest [pontiff]. For the pope thinks thus: | must surrender to the will of those beasts in this perilous time. Even though the little ship of Peter is rocked by a wave, it will not be sunk. Even if the Lutherans rage for a hundred years, they will finally recognize the Roman Church again. | Martin Luther rejoice that | have lived until the time of the humiliation of the papacy, that he is forced to allow his patrons the 


preservation of poor students! 


8. church account of the common box. 


On April 23, D. Martinus said of the account of the common box at N., since the councilors were thought suspicious, as if they went 


1) The word "buzz" is probably correctly rendered with "sons", because in Old German "sun" stands for son", as in the beginning of the Hildebrand song "sunufadarungo" (son and father). By the sons of Ferdinand are probably to be understood the princes

maintains his reputation. Yes, because the word goes, nothing comes of it. What will become then when the monasteries and churches have fallen? The 


1386 Cap. 56. of ecclesiastical or church property. §8-11. 1387 


They were not faithful with it, because they had not left the priest his key to it. The Elector's order is, he said, that one should have three keys to each common box: the priest one, the council one, and the box lords also one; so that no one can be held suspicious. For this reason, | will diligently and harshly insist that the parish priest be given his key back; but if they so assassinate and do not act publicly, they will give the Elector cause to take the church goods to himself with great damage to the church. For our treasury, praise God, has an abundant annual income: if it were to remain constant, the church services could be restored. Therefore, because | am alive, | want to make the keys work again. 


9. from the church property shall be ordered preaching chairs and schools. 


When it was said of spiritual goods that there might be a war over them, for kings and princes would be hungry for them, and would look diligently to them, D. Martinus said, "There is no need for us to have it all, for we would be worse off than they. Martinus said: "There is no need that it should remain all for us, for we would become worse than they: we should be content when we have plenty and abundance. If churches and schools are honestly provided for, we have enough. The rest they may distribute in peace for the maintenance of poor people and for common necessities; it has no blessing. It has come from whores' wages, and that is where it will come again; as the prophet says, according to the common saying: Evil gained, evil lost. 


10. what pens could be used for. 


Monasteries could well be reformed and do much good, for they are the treasury of the country: if they are torn apart, they will be shamed. | do not like to see that our princes have such a desire for bishoprics 1) because | fear that they will eat their death and lose their own over it. 


1) So Stangwald instead of "bishops". 


They want to exterminate the pope and the bishops by force; nothing will come of it. Just as the pope crushes his head when he wants to destroy the gospel, so our nobles will also crush their heads over the pope. God's word must break off the pope, otherwise no arms will do him any good; for he is the devil. In ancient times, it was said that if one strikes or hits a spirit, one wounds or hits oneself. A fine wise and true saying. If we draw the sword on the pope, we will strike ourselves. 


11. abuse of spiritual goods. 


When some said that our princes and lords of the Augsburg Confession had accepted the gospel in order to take the churches and spiritual goods, D. M. Luther said: Contrarium est verum, the contradiction is true: but Ferdinand the emperor and Albrecht the bishop of Mainz are stealing them. M. Luther: Contrarium est verum, the contradiction is true: but Ferdinand, the emperor, and bishop of Mainz, Albrecht 2c. rob them. Ferdinandus has valued all monasteries. The bishopric of Wurzburg recently had to give him a thousand florins; thus the emperor took the bishopric of Utrecht and robbed it. Bavarians are the greatest robbers of church property, for they have rich monasteries. My most gracious lord and the landgrave have poor beggar monasteries. 

As it was discussed at the Imperial Diet that the monasteries should be handed over to the emperor so that he could put his captains in them, | myself advised, and | still want to advise, that the monasteries should be gathered into a heap beforehand. For who would want to suffer an imperial captain in his country? It is all the bishop of Mainz's transmission: these same fellows would have liked to keep the upper hand over the monasteries. So they would do, like the pope, who ate all the monasteries in Jtalia and abbeys. Now, because they cannot have them, they cry out: "One should do this reverence to the emperor, and leave and grant him such goods 2c. 

No, do you hear? such goods belong to Christian, righteous, faithful teachers in kitchens and schools, poor students, and otherwise house-poor people: so the lawyers also cry out that they are of the church. Give them back, they say, their monasteries, so that one may 


1388 


If you have monks and nuns and say mass, they will let you preach. 

Yes, where will we get food from? say our people. We will let you take care of that, they say. Yes, the devil thanks them. 


12. interpretation of this saying. 


Divitias peperit mater ecclesia honorificata, et postea filia perdidit matrem. And this is true, said D. M. Luther. For although the church has much wealth and goods, those who are not worthy use them. There is a fine example of this in the challenges of the Lord Christ, Matth. 4, 1. ff. First, the church is afflicted with poverty and hunger, as under the Roman emperors. Secondly, with heretics. Our Lord Christ is not led by the devil into the temple, but onto the battlements of the temple, that is, over the holy Scriptures. Thirdly, it is contested with riches and with violence; this happened under the popes, when they only ate, drank, and made merry, forgetting the Bible and the Holy Scriptures. 


(13) Spiritual goods shall be used for the maintenance of the preaching chair. 


Doctor M. Luther said: That the King of Denmark, Christianus, had written to him how he had deposed all the bishops in his kingdom, and in their place superintendents, doctores, and Christian pastors and teachers.

and made honest scholarships for them, and requested Luther's advice and concerns in this regard. Luther's advice and concern in this matter. But the king has put an article in the letter that all income, rent and interest of the bishops should come under the crown. There spoke D. M. Luther: This king may reach into it; but this article male olet, sua quaerere; | am worried that the crown would be moved too far for the poor parish priests, so that they would have to suffer hunger afterwards. Ille Rex non habet illum propensum animum ad alendos ministros verbi, ut noster Elector. Nam noster Princeps loannes Fridericus, Dei gratia, solus est defensor et nutritor pastorum. He may freely venture all spiritual goods again on the church servants. He has granted the Visitatoribus in Thuringia from the monasteries, for the entertainment of the parish priests and schoolmasters, handsome interest annually. 

And after His Elector! Grace took the homage of the city and university of Wittenberg in 1532, he improved the scholarships of all professors, and gave the university a large allowance from several monasteries, and made certain pensions and incomes. This is a princely mind, that a lord does not seek his own benefit, but feeds poor parish priests, students and schoolmasters from spiritual goods: for His Princely Grace realizes that he will need parish priests who would instruct his subjects in God's Word.

1. What to think of the writings of some Vaeans. 


Hieronymum may be read for the sake of the histories, for there is not a word in his writings about faith and the right true religion and doctrine. | have already condemned Origen. Chrysostom is also worthless to me, he is only a launderer. Basil is no good at all, is even a monk, | would not give a hair's breadth about him. The Apologia of Phil. Melanchthon's Apologia surpasses all doctores in the church, even Augustinum. Hilarius = and Theophylactus are good. Ambrose, too, sometimes goes into detail about the forgiveness of sins, which is the highest article, namely, that the divine majesty forgives and pardons sin by grace, for the sake of Christ, who paid for it for us and did enough. 


The fathers in the church are good for teaching, but they do not count for much in disputing. (Cordatus No. 1741.) 


The fathers and teachers such as Augustine, Jerome, Hilarius, Bonaventure 2c. are to be held in great honor because of the testimonies of faith by which they testify that the church believed in Jesus Christ in the beginning. Bernard preaches very beautifully, but does not disputate as well as he preaches. Bonaventure is closest to him. 


3. another censorship of the school teachers. 


Bonaventure is the best among the school theologians and church scribes. Augustine has the first, Ambrose the second, Bernard the third. Tertullianus is a right Carlstadt among the church teachers. Cyril has the best sayings. Cyprianus the Martyr is a weak theologian. Theophylactus is the best interpreter and translator of St. Paul. 


4. from the Chpriani book. (Lauterbach, Dec. 12, 1538, p. 191 f.) 


That day he read Cyprian's de singularitate clericorum (on the celibate life of the clergy), how they separate from wives

but would have to, where he treats unrhymed and childish things. Then he wondered about the inconsistencies of such a great man and sighingly doubted whether the book was by Cyprian. But it is no wonder, when one falls away from God's word and order, one must wallow in the aergernissen. Thus, since they rejected marriage, God's order, and the manifest testimonies and examples of Scripture, they fell into fornication, adultery 2c., with which they had to beat themselves. This Cyprian was almost the closest to the apostles under Valerian, barely 220 years after the apostles. The oldest was Tertullian, 2. Hegesippus, 3. Cyprianus, 4. Lactantius, then Gregory of Nazianzus; afterwards Jerome, Augustine, Eusebius. In their time the church degenerated. Yes, even during the lifetime of the apostles we see the sad complaints of Paul about the Corinthians and Galatians, and Christ himself had among his own the accursed [sanctum] Judas. Those may lead who want the church entirely pure and cleansed. That means not wanting a church at all. So let us take heed to our profession and be vigilant. For very easily there is a fall in a word of religion, and senseless, deluded [retu- gwuivoi] men are easily led into error, alienated from the truth. Such a one was Pelagius, who by the inconsistent argument deceived many in the article of justification: By grace we are justified; to know Moses and the law is grace, therefore the knowledge of the law makes one justified. There people did not recognize the most palpable deception. Thus the holy fathers said that in the prayer of the Lord, in the fourth petition, one should not pray for bodily things, because that would be against the word of Christ (Matth. 6, 25.): "Do not worry"; as if this prayer did not rather hinder worry. Therefore it is called dprov imwéaiov (Matth. 6, 11.), the daily bread, for and for, forever. If the book of Solomon of the creatures (1 Kings 4, 33.) were still there. of which he himself boasts, it would be a very great treasure. 5. from St. Ambrosia.

6. from Chrhsostomo. (Lauterbach, Aug. 24, 1538, p. 120.) 


Then they spoke of the writings of the holy fathers about the Bible, which left the reader in uncertainty. He answered: | must not judge them, because their reputation is with everyone, and | must be an apostate. But read whoever will, especially Chrysostom, who is a very great orator, how he digresses from the subject to other things. When | interpreted the Epistle to the Ebraeans and consulted Chrysostom, [I found that] he wrote nothing in regard to the contents of the epistle. And | believe that Chrysostom, the greatest rhetor, had a large audience, but taught without fruit. For in order to teach, the first and foremost task of a preacher is to direct his attention to the matter and content and essence of the matter, and to instruct the hearer. When this is done, he can then rhetoric and exhort in a suitable manner. 


7. from fathers. (The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, Aug. 27, 1538, p. 123.) 

Behold, | pray, how great darkness there was among the fathers concerning the faith. For since the article of justification was obscured, it was impossible to suppress even one, even the grossest error. St. Jerome wrote on Matthew, the Epistle to the Galatians, to Titus, but very weakly. Ambrose wrote six books on the first book of Moses. Oh how thin they are! Augustine wrote nothing perceptive of the faith, except where he argues against the Pelagians. They woke up Augustine and made him a man. They taught very well, but except for the fights they could not teach publicly. Is yet no interpretation on the epistle to the Romans and Galatians that taught anything pure. O what a time we have now in pure teaching! but, alas, we despise it. The holy fathers lived better 1) than 


After that he told the horrible case of Gregorius, who cursed a brother in the grave for the sake of three florins and then had him ransomed by another brother by means of thirty masses 2). After that, the pope burst in with his pernicious human statutes, binding the people to his filth and shitty law by eating meat, wearing caps, and saying masses. Thus, the abominable case increased day by day, so that the pope claimed for himself the saying of Augustine: "I did not believe the Gospel" 2c. [Evan- gelio non crederem etc..], that is: | the pope am the head of the church; where | am, there is the church; since he is but a servant and bondservant of the church. They do not see the opportunity for this saying of Augustine, that he speaks against the Manichaeans: | do not believe you, because you are damned heretics. But the Church, the bride of Christ, cannot err; | agree with her. 

Long before Hieronymo, Epiphanias described the histories of the churches, which are very good and useful: if they were separated from quarrelsome arguments and quarrelsome matters, they would be well worth printing. 

The fathers had a great reputation and appearance because of their good conduct and austere life: with fasting and vigilance they shone forth and excelled. It must also be in such people: for there must be either a shine and brightness, like the hypocrite, or a righteousness of heart, like the great heroes whom God raises up. 


8. from Prudentio. (Lauterbach, Oct. 7, 1538, p. 143.) 


After that he said of the hymns of Prudentius, who was a very good and Christian poet. If he had lived in Virgil's time, he would have been praised more than Horace, whom Virgil praises so much. | wish very much that the poem of Prudentius would be read in

Tertullian, he said that he was hard and superstitious, and that Cyprian had called him his teacher: Magistrum! 

Augustine has had more trouble and work: that he has wrapped and torn himself from the fathers’ writings, that has become much more difficult and sour for him, than with the heretics. Gregory interprets the five pounds in the Gospel, which he gave to his servants, to mean the five senses, which are also in unreasonable animals; but he interprets the two pounds to mean the mind and effect. 


10. of the four pillars in the church and other ancient teachers. 


Ambrose is the most distinguished and oldest, then Jerome; after Augustine, who fell asleep in 480, now it is 1111" years. Gregory the fourth. Ambrose was also a political and well-trained and tried man in world affairs, after which he was elected bishop of Milan, and was much used by the emperor, could not refrain from worldly affairs, as it happens to us now. For we have to serve the table and consistory with marital affairs more than God's word and prayer. So 


spoons and cups, lived among the people and dealt Dawith them, did not lead a monstrous and monastic life. But the papists invented such things to embellish and 


efend their errors. As Tetzel said: "Whoever wants to dvise his soul, give here, redeem the grace, after your eath the children will forget you, they will do nothing 0 you. 

Macarius, Antonius, Benedictus have done a reat, noticeable damage to the church with their onasticism. Let it be that they have led a particularly onstrous life, but it is not a holy life. And | believe that 

n heaven they are much lower than a pious, God- earing husband and man of the world. Therefore, in itis Patrum there is a very good and Christian poem of a piritual man, in which a tanner who had a wife and hildren. St. Anthony is far preferred and held more acred 2c.

The material taken, and lay it out finely simple and actually, with all diligence, quite correctly and properly. Although what is Christian and good in the patriarchs and teachers is not to be despised. But a judicium belongs to it. But if Satan falls from the material through false teachers and wants to go the wrong way, he should be resisted and persuaded. As, when the pope shows this saying, Matth. 16, 18. 19. on his primacy: "You are Peter 2c. What you will solve on earth" 2c., since the text speaks of keys and forgiveness of sins; so the pope brings sejnen Dieterich to seize and possess worldly empires and kingdoms. 


11 Another Judgment of D. M. Luther's opinion of the fathers and teachers in the church. 


Although I, said D. M. Luther, it does not behoove me to judge from the holy fathers; for, held against them, | am a little worm and nothing to be looked at: but the more | read their books which they wrote, the more | am annoyed, for they were nevertheless men, and their authority and prestige has suppressed and diminished the books and writings of the apostles. 

Therefore the papists were allowed to impudently say: What Scripture, Scripture! one must read the holy fathers and teachers, they have sucked and drawn the honey from the Scripture: the holy Scripture is like a large, wild, disorderly, confused heap or lump 2c. It is as if God's word could not be understood and was not German and could not be heard, since the heavenly Father says of Christ, Matth. 17, 5: "You shall hear him. He also spoke and taught in the Gospels in the most simple, clearest and worst way, in parables and similes, as he says: "He who believes in me will not die", Joh. 8, 51. Item Matth. 5, 39: "You shall not resist evil"; and Matth. 6, 26. 28: "Look at the birds of the air and the flowers of the field" 2c. 

How could it be said more clearly and distinctly, more than all fathers and teachers have been able to do and could have done; nevertheless, may 


The sophists blaspheme the holy scripture, pretending that it is obscure and not well understood, therefore they had to explain the fathers. But such explanation means and is rather to darken and obscure. 

That is why I like St. Augustine above all other teachers: for he is a great, excellent doctor and worthy of all praise; even though he had a small congregation and church, he taught righteously and purely and subjected his books to the Holy Scriptures with Christian humility, as is also stated in the decree c. Nolo meis scriptis etc. Thou shalt not believe my books as the holy scriptures, in which, 1) if thou shalt find that thou didst not believe before, believe the same without delay; but what thou thinkest not certain in my writings, thou shalt not think certain, for thou understandest it certainly. Then the dear man himself protests, testifies, recognizes, implores and compels that his writings are not to be given greater credence, nor are they to be considered equal to the holy Scriptures, much less preferred. 

And | believe that Augustine wrote this sentence primarily and mostly for the sake of Chrysostom, who lived barely sixty years before Augustine. And because he was eloquent and voluble, he was held in high esteem by the people, and made many books that had a great appearance, but was only a great, angry, disorderly heap and mixture, and a sack of words with nothing behind them. 

Therefore, this hurt Augustino, angered him, and said such a thing. That is why our Doctor Jerome Schirf bought Chrysostom for him, and when he had read it, he said, "I read a lot, but | learn nothing. For he could with his chatter and loquacity. 2) He could make the people fine and paint them, like a golden chain, therefore he was also called John with the golden mouth. He may have had gold in sound and song, but not in dignity. Oh, the priests were also human beings, as we are, therefore one should consider it well and put what they say on the gold scale, 3) look at their mouths. 

1) In the editions "which. (Férstemann-Bindseil.) 


2) i.e. talkativeness. 3) Cf. Cap. 7, § 1, end of first paragraph. 


1398 


For this reason, St. Augustine took great pains and sweated when he was annoyed by human statutes and traditions; however, he is mighty in the Holy Scriptures and has a fine judgment and understanding of things. The Pelagians and heretics have driven him and sharpened him, he has been favorable and kind to marriages, speaks well of bishops who were pastors at that time; but that time has annoyed him very much and hurt him. What would happen in our time, if he were alive now and should see the abominations of the pope, who with great authority and hope boasts of St. Peter's patrimony and inheritance, that is, that the whole empire in the Occident is his inheritance; which glory has lasted barely four hundred years since the time that the pope wanted to be a lord over all empires and kingdoms. St. Augustine would not suffer that. 

Summa Summarum: Believing Christians should only badly listen to the legation and message of the Lord Christ, what he says. Therefore, all those who want to change the Gospel of Christ by human authority, power and prestige and interpret it differently, which no king, prince or lord allows his legate and envoy to do, are doing completely unchristian and against God. He gives him a credence, 1) that his person should be heard; but no further, not even in one word, as he is commanded in his instruction: and we would be so presumptuous in this heavenly and divine legation and message? 

I think that if St. Peter now preached all the articles of the Holy Scriptures in the flesh, denying only the authority, power and primacy of the Pope, 1) said that he was not the supreme head of Christianity, he would have to hang; 3) yes, Christ himself, if he still walked on earth and preached, he would be crucified once again. Therefore let us also wait for this. It is better to wait for him than for the pope. If we did not believe that after this there would be another life, | would soon say and sing differently, and lay the burden on another's neck.

12. the passion song. 


When the Passion was sung, Luther listened diligently and said: "Musica is a beautiful, lovely gift of God; it has often awakened and moved me so that | have gained a desire to preach. But St. Augustine took such a conscience away from him: when he enjoyed music and became happy about it, he thought that he had done something wrong and sinful with it. He was a fine pious man; if he lived in the present time, he would keep it with us. But Jerome would condemn us, who after all was also a man and had his temptations and infirmities; for he was so fond of the Eustochiam that one was annoyed by it. The dear fathers also had their shortcomings. 

Augustine is the most serious, bravest and purest of all; but he alone could not do it all, nor put it right. For he often complains that the bishops with their traditions and statutes burden the church more than the Jews with their laws. 

Ambrosii Hymni and hymns are words, little that serves the cause, as: A solis ortus sidere,, on the seven times. The song Patris Sapientia did many good things; but the song Rex Christe, factor omnium etc. is the very best hymn and song. 


The Lyra Commentary on the Bible. 


Luther praised Lyra's commentary on the entire Bible very much and ordered it to be read diligently, because it would be very good, especially for the histories in the Old Testament. Whoever knew the New Testament well would find Lyra very useful. However, the comments that Paul and Simigerus made about it are cold enough; they would be left out if Lyra were printed again.

4. a different one from fathers. 


The Fathers have written many good and useful things; however, one should read them cum Judicio, not accept and approve of everything soon, because one has first held it against the guideline of God's Word and examined whether it also agrees with the same. 

Hilarius and Augustine have written many beautiful and excellent things about the Holy Trinity and Justification, driven by heretics. Nazianzenus nothing. Gregorius is a monk. Cyprianus a pious man and orator. Tertullianus and Eusebius write only histories. Lactantius, as Augustine testifies, has tractirt foreign things. In peace they did nothing, but in conflict they were powerful. St. Bernard loves Jesus as much as anyone can; but in disputes, when one must stand against one's enemies, he is not St. Bernard. Manichaei, the heretics, provoked Augustine to fight, challenged him, and gave him reason to write so well. The papists do not understand this, but say that he talked too much and wrote too high things. 


5. from St. John the Martyr. 


Doctor Staupitz told us (said D. M. Luther), he had heard from Doctor Andrea Proles, the best preacher, because he once went to Gotha into the monastery and saw painted Doctor Andream Zachariam (who is buried at Erfurt in the Augustinian monastery in front of the high altar, and is said to have overcome Johann Husten, as it is said) with a rose on his beret; he would have said: "God protect me that | do not wear this rose, because he has overcome Johann Husten unjustly, through a forged Bible, namely, since Ezekielis in the 34th chapter said: "Behold, | myself will punish my shepherds and not the people, non Populus. Chapter thus confessed: "Behold, | myself will punish and punish my shepherds (to this was said), and not the people, non Populus." They found this text in Johannis Hussen's own bibles, pointed it out to him, and concluded from it: "Behold, you shall not punish the Pope, but God will do it Himself. Then M. Spalatinus said: The devil has brought this text into the Bible. Yes, said D. M. Luther, it

has stood in it in the same way as it has come in. So the pious, holy man was condemned and burned. 

Item: M. Johannes Agricola read a scripture of Johannis Huss, full and rich in spirit, patience and prayer: and as he was martyred in prison by the stone, and despised by the emperor Sigismundo, D. M. Luther marveled at such a great spirit and steadfastness, and said: He has been a great man; for soon after his death the emperor Sigismund had no luck. M. Luther marveled at such a great spirit and steadfastness, and said: "He was a noble man, his death was well smelled; for soon after his death Emperor Sigismund had no more luck, was never well again, became the most wretched regent, and was defeated by the Turk. The Bohemians devastated Germany everywhere, Nuremberg had to give them plunder: they came as far as Zeiz. The Germans have beaten the Bohemians several times with heel money.

6. from St. Augustino. 


Augustine therefore became an excellent teacher, that the heretics, the Pelagians, who defended free will, attacked him hard, that he had to defend himself vigorously, and finally collected; taught faithfully about the grace of God. 

But since | understood Paulum by God's grace, | have not been able to respect any doctor; they have become very little to me. In the first | read Augustinum. But when the door was opened to me in Paul, so that | knew what the righteousness of faith was, then it was over with him. These are the most noble and best sayings in Augustine: Sin is forgiven, not that it is no longer there, but that it is not imputed. Item: The law is fulfilled when that is forgiven which neither happens nor is done. The books of Confession in which he makes his confession teach nothing, but only incite and provoke, have only examples, but it is nothing.

(Cordatus No. 571. 572. 573.) he died, not like an Anabaptist, but like a Christian. 


Christian weakness is seen in him, and yet God's power is stirred in him and raises him up again. The struggle of the flesh and spirit in Christ and Hussen is sweet and lovely to see. The testimony of all is that Jerome of Prague was a very eloquent man, but Huss was very learned. He could do more than the whole world, but was innocently condemned. From that time lon, the papacy began to fall. Then someone said: Costnitz is now a poor, miserable town. Yes, said D. M. Luther, | believe that God has punished them for having led the dear holy man, Hussen, to the fire with larmed and fortified citizens and people. 

In Johanne Huss the Holy Spirit has been very powerful, said D. M. Luther, who alone held so joyfully and firmly to God's word, against so many great people and nations, Italia, Germany, Hispania, Gallia, England, so gathered in the Concilio at Costnitz; against which clamor he alone stood and had to bear it, and was burned over it. So | will be much safer, God willing, dead than alive. 


Gerson saw very well that we are like lost sheep when we are alone; therefore he said that Christ instituted his supper for communion. This Gerson alone wrote about the temptation of the spirit, the others all wrote only about bodily things. None of the others, neither Augustine, nor Bernard, nor Scotus, nor Thomas 2c., has written of the pettiness of the spirit than he. William of Paris also wrote something, but the scholastic doctors did not even come to know the Catechism. 

Gerson alone has comforted consciences under the pope, saying, Ah, it must not all be mortal sin that is done against the pope, for [as] a shepherd 1) do not have on, the hearers do not pray 2c. And some he has delivered from despair. He has been a very good man, but he has not come to that, that he comforted the Christians through Christ and the promises. He did not abolish the law, but lessened it, saying, Oh, all sin need not be so grievous. 

When | compare Moses and Christ, Christ knocks the bottom out of the barrel and says: "Do not put your (The following at Cordatus No. 253.) trust in Moses, but in Christ. If you are not pious, then John Huss took away briars from the vineyard of lam pious. And this is the art of the Christian, that ||God, but | came may leap from my sin to the righteousness of Christ.

Moreover, after John there had always been some good men who had contradicted the pope, but before John there had been none.

2. from St. Luca and Johanne, as they described the Passion. (Cordatus No. 1347.) 


Lucas has carefully described the story of the suffering of Christ before all. John, however, writes the main action, the audience [the interrogation before Pilate]. Concordant accounts [concordantiae] are tog tiring; John has resorted to brevity in this history. 


St. John and Paul were especially sure of their teaching. 


In St. Paul and John there was a peculiar, excellent certainty and plerophoria: they speak of it as if it were already ready before their eyes. Therefore Christ does not say in vain Apost. 9, 15: "He (St. Paul) shall be a chosen instrument unto me." He made him a doctor] that is why he speaks so confidently of the matter! Whoever runs Paul may rely on his words with a cleay conscience. | have never read a more serioug scripture in my life. 

John in his Gospel describes Christ, that he is real true, natural God, a priori, from before: "In the beginning was the Word" 2c. Item: "He who praises and honors me also honors the Father." But Paul a posteriori et effectu from that which follows, and from the work, as he says 1 Cor. 10, 9: "They tempted Christ in the wilderness’ 2c.; therefore Christ is right, true God; and Acts. 20} 28: "Take heed therefore unto yourselves" 2c.

5. judgment of D. M. Luther's judgment of books in the Old Testament. 


(Cordatus No. 1007 and No. 1782.) 


Jesus Sirach is only a teacher of the law, not a prophet, and knows nothing of Christ and his gospel, which deals with the first and second commandments and is above the third [which it does not care about because this was given only for a certain time, and even now serves the word. 

God established the most beautiful world and church order in the fifth book of Moses, but the world always likes what is theirs better than what is God's. 


6. from the preacher Salomonis. (The first three paragraphs, Cordatus No. 1583. 989,990.) 


About Ecclesiastes 1) he said when it was published: The book should be more complete, it has too much broken off. It has neither boots nor spurs, it rides only on sticks, like me, when | was a monk in the monastery. 

| do not believe that Solomon is condemned, but what is written about him is written for the kings to fear. 

| believe that the book of Jesus Sirach [Ecclesiasticus] was written at the time of the Maccabees. It is a very good book, household rules, speeches and a mixture of many books, perhaps from the library of Ptolemy Euergetes, just as the proverbs are collected from others, but from the mouth of the king, because royal majesty shines from them. 

The book of the Proverbs of Solomon is a beautiful

how things are in the world: there is nothing but the fear of God and prayer, in which rulers should practice. So they go about with the mathematics, and reckon: this bears so much to me, that so much; and they would take our Lord God captive; and he saith, O dear, take me not captive. No, no, they say. Now, for more than three years, he has left you behind. 


1) Perhaps here, too, there is a confusion of Ieelesiastss and Ecclesiasticus (Jesus Sirach), as in No. 130 of the Cordatus. See Appendix No. IL.

see. It is nothing; Benedictio Domini divites facit: the blessing of the Lord makes rich. So it is with mines, so it is with Benedictio Domini: they want to take our Lord God and his grace captive, and want to seize it; and yet he does not want to be seized nor captured. For all the Scriptures are full of it: Lro8io in aomo Impt: "In the house of the wicked is the curse," Proverbs 3:33. Let it be as little as we will, so let us call upon our Lord GOD and pray, if he will but give us a piece of bread, and give us a sound body in addition. But if we sin, and he chastise us for it at times, let us close our eyes to him. He shall not see it; we will do it ourselves. So we do it, and experience it with our great harm. So it is with princes and lords. For they cannot say, as David did, Qui das salutem Regibus, et qui subdis populum meum sub me: "Thou givest salvation to the king, and castest my people under me," Ps. 18:48, 51.

In the same way, Homer used Troy, and Virgil Aeneas, to describe in him prudence, heroism, happiness, accident 2c). 

The book of Judith is a tragedy in which the end and downfall of tyrants is described; Tobias, however, is a comedy that speaks of women. In that book is an example of the world regime, in this one an example of the household. Baruch is a hermit who has forgotten the register. He does not pay attention to the time, and the passage [Bar. 3, 38]: "He appeared on earth" is not about Christ, but about the bush of Moses.

lam hostile to the book of Esther and the second book of the Maccabees, because they are too Judaizing and have a pagan character. However, it is frightening that the book of Esther is held in higher esteem by the Jews than Isaiah or Daniel, since Isaiah proclaims Christ in the purest way, and Daniel clearly describes the world kingdoms and the kingdom of Christ. 

Tobias is a Jewish poem, and not particularly appropriate, because the devil is not driven out with a fish liver, because he leads against us the right Goliath spear. For God has armed him and is still sharpening his weapons, giving him steel for his shaft, the law, 2) but he still arms him with the precaution that he [the devil], finally defeated by the faithful, must be the more ashamed and become a disgrace.

Then he said, "Do not take it from Moses, for the evangelists have described the sermons in the New Testament in the shortest possible way: how briefly they run through, even touch, only the sermons of John the Baptist, who undoubtedly preached the most beautiful sermons; only this saying is shown, since St. John says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who bears the sin of the world" John 1:29.

8. a clever man's thoughtlessly sacrilegious judgment of the books of the holy bible. 


(Cordatus No?1647.) 


It is in the nature of reason that nothing pleases one so much as what is related to his spirit. For example, there was a man who made a great judgment of the Scriptures, saying that Jesus Sirach was so great that the words of the Gospel were of little value compared to his teachings. But although this book is a good one as far as jurisprudence, understanding of the law and housekeeping are concerned, and therefore pleases the world, what is it in comparison with the gospel and the writings of the apostles? For what is life against the word of life?

11. what books to preach in church. (Cordatus No. 1044. 1045.) 

The Psalter, the Gospel of John, Paul are to be preached and remain in the church for those who have to contend, but Matthew for the people. 

David has given to light [edidit] teaching psalms, prophetic, prayer and thanksgiving psalms, the children of Korah vain comfort psalms. Among the prophetic ones the most excellent are: [Ps. 110. The Lord said to my Lord, Ps. 51. God, be gracious to me laccording to your goodness, Ps. 32. Blessed is he 

hose transgressions are forgiven, Ps. 130. From the depths | cry out to you, O Lord, Ps. 143. Lord, hear my prayer: for these teach that the forgiveness of sins akes place without the law. Therefore these psalms are purely Pauline. For what is this but [Ps. 130:4], For with thee is forgiveness, that thou shouldest be feared?" and what Paul says [Rom. 11:32], "He hath concluded all under sin, that he might have mercy on all." "That they may fear thee," that all may take off their little hats before thee, that none may boast in his righteousness, and that forgiveness of sins may be reconciliation, not merit. 


12. from St. John's Gospel. (Cordatus No. 132.) 

John speaks such simple words in his epistle and gospel that simpler ones will never come into the world. And yet, under this simplicity of his, he speaks everything that another would [put forward] with the greatest harshness and severity. For example, these two words may serve, "He that hath not the Son hath not the Father," and the other two, "The law was given by Moses, the truth was made by JEsum Christ." 1) 


13. from the prophet Daniel. (Contained in Cap. 27, § 2.) 1) Although the last two citations contain words of John the 


Baptist, John is probably to be understood as "the evangelist", because the epistles are also mentioned.

1. from David. (Cordatus No. 1573. 1574.) 

The example of David is full of adversity, for this holy man fell into adultery, then into the most shameful murder and blasphemy. For this reason he was afflicted when the people and his own son fell away from him, as did his counselors. He became nothing, who before had the highest reputation and fortune. All kings feared him because they saw that God was with him. Now not only all the wicked rebel against him, but also the most lowly boast against him, like Shimei, and he, who before was called by the prophet [Isa. 15:5] a three-year-old heifer, that is, full of strength, whom none of the kings could overcome, now seems to be able to be overcome by all, because all set themselves against him. 


This trouble has always been in the world, that the godly have always been very unhappy, and on the other hand the godless happy, as we also see today that the bishops and godless princes sit in the greatest honor and goods, while the godly are poor and despised.

2. David has to see through the fingers of many things. (The first movement in Cordatus No. 1284.) 

David was a good king, could well lend one a good bill. So he saw Joab, his cousin and uncle, also to and through the fingers, because he could not turn it all to bolts. David must have had worse devils than we do, for he could not have had such a great revelation and knowledge of God without such great temptations, for they are too great. He made psalms and sang them. How can we not do it? 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 1634.) 

David was an excellent man, that he preached so bravely against his son the worship of his people [1 Kings 2:1 ff], and yet he could not resist, by force he could not exterminate the sacrificers, the false teachers 2c. and since he could do nothing else, he sang a little song to our Lord God in the Psalms. 

Doctor Martin Luther said: All tragedies apud Graecos are nothing compared to the history of David. 1) How great a thing itis! 


1) Cf. §19 of this chapter. 


1420

that his own son slept with all his wives, 2 Sam. 16, 22, so that he had to be an undying widower for the rest of his life. After that our Lord God gave him another wife when he was old. How much of an outrage it will have been among the Gentiles, 1) that among God's people this should happen to a father from his son! It is a wonder that the other brothers, who were the children of other women, allowed it. 


(The following at Cordatus No. 1408.) 


Many kémge of the Jews, of whose life it is apparently written that it was godless, | believe, have become blessed through faith in the promise, and because great estates cannot keep themselves free from great sins and necessarily often lack. And therefore this is a kind word: He fell asleep with his fathers; they have all gone to heaven. The word "fell asleep" has a good meaning in Scripture, but those who are written as having been killed by their enemies or consumed by wild animals and birds are condemned. 


Why David did not build the temple. 


Doctor Martin Luther was asked why David did not have to build the temple, since God had told him to do so beforehand. M. Luther answered and said: "That is why he shed much blood and wielded the sword: not that he did wrong in this, but that he could not be Christ's figure or type, who should have a peaceful kingdom without sword and bloodshed; but Solomon had to do it, who is called in German Friederich, or peaceable, who had a peaceful and quiet kingdom, through which Christ's kingdom was signified. 


4. Judas Maccabaeus. 


Now in our time it is just like in the time of Jude Maccabee, who protected and defended his people, and nevertheless was able to defeat the enemies.

D. M. Luther spoke of the legends of the holy patriarchs, how far and high they surpassed the holiness of all the saints, for they went about in simple obedience to God, in the works of their profession, doing what came before their hands, according to God's command without distinction; therefore Sarah, Abraham's wife, also surpassed all other wives. 

Psalms were read over the table in the evening: "Lord, help your people" 2c., Ps. 28, 9. item Ps. 68, 21: "We have a God who helps, and the Lord Lord who saves from death" 2c. Then someone asked D. M. Luthern: How could it be that David, who was set and ordained king by God, had so many troubles and plagues, as his psalms indicate, which are songs of lamentation and mourning, that he did not have many good days? M. Luther answered and said: He has been so plagued by the godless and false teachers. He has seen that the people have set themselves against him and have suffered much upheaval and indignation; this has taught him to pray. Apart from the temptation, he was reckless and safe, as seen in the adultery and death of Uriah. 

Oh, dear Lord God, that you would let such great people fall! This David had six wives, no doubt wise and understanding, like the wise Abigail: if they were all so, David had excellent wives. Over and above these he had ten concubines; nor did he become an adulterer. 

We would gladly reign: if then we come into the reign, it is toil and trouble: then help our Lord God, who began the play, that [it] may go forth well.

Doctor M. Luther said: That the repudiation and rejection would have been only temporal. For the hatred against Jacob, his brother,

The sorrow has been too great for them. After thirty years at least, they began to have children. 

Eve will surpass all women in sorrow and misery at the Last Judgment, for no more wretched, sorrowful woman was ever born than she. Therefore let the women with their misery be silent before Eve; she has seen that we must all die because of her. When Cain came to do it, she hoped he would be the right seed; he would do it, but he beat Abel, his brother, to death, and was cursed. This is a case. 

Then said one, Some would have Cain conceived before the promise of the seed that should bruise the serpent's head.

22. from Hagar, Abraham's Kebsweibe. 


One of them said: Abraham has rejected Hagar, his concubine, with his son Ishmael exactly with a very small veneration, gives her only a bottle full of wine. M. Luther said: Yes, it is true, but she might come back for more. It is only a sign of good will, not of the inheritance; she should know that she would not have to claim anything from the inheritance, but what would be given to her would be out of good will, not out of obligation nor by right. 


Cap. 60. Of the patriarchs and prophets. § 20-24. 


1429 


The text Gen 25:9 says: Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham. Therefore, it appears that Ishmael was not always with his father, and was raised and nourished out of the kindness of his father. It is because of this that he wants to lead Christ through the line, therefore Ishmael is set apart, like Esau, Solomon. 


23. David a rhetor. 


No Cicero, Virgilius, Demosthenes has been such a rhetor and eloquent as David: as is seen in the 119th Psalm, where he gives one opinion in two and twenty ways, and yet is only one sentence and sense, only that the words are changed. Therefore, he had a great gift, was highly graced by God. Therefore, | also think that God made him do such a terrible thing, so that he would not become too proud. 

Moses and David are also the highest two prophets. What Isaiah has, he takes from David, and the other prophets also. We are all poor disciples compared to them; we may have a spirit, but the gifts are nowhere as great. 

Item: When the 119th Psalm was read by 22 little laws or silences, D. M. Luther said: "Who can show me a Latin or Greek historian or speaker who is as rich in words as David? M. Luther: "Who can tell me about a Latin or Greek historian or orator who is as rich in words as David? He has a psalm of 22 verses, in each of which § verses are made, and yet is only of one opinion in all of them; namely, he wants to say, your law and word, Lord, is good. But he is so rich in words that he always repeats and repeats. 

In sum, nothing is lacking in the Holy Scriptures except that they do not bear money; but God intended it so that one should not handle it and become rich. 

Item: David was able to strike out a thing with words, if he wanted, as one sees in the 119th Psalm. He could also be short and summarize the whole religion and doctrine in one psalm, as in the 110th psalm. 


24. David's suffering. 


David had to suffer much, none of us could have endured such things. For him not 


1430 


Only the concubines have been defiled, but also all the wives, and, what is great, in a holy place. It is a great thing that it should happen to such a holy man. Certainly no thing on earth has hurt him as much as this. If God has so afflicted anyone except His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, | am amazed. 

Jehoshaphat and Ezekiel had more fortune and more glorious victory than David, who waged war with his great danger and difficulty. 

David's Historia is the most wonderful, a real tragedy, although it finally becomes a comedy. The anger of the pagans must have hurt him cruelly, that the pagans were angry with him, 1) because they saw that his own son had brought down his mother. This has made him so cold and taken away all his strength. | do not hope that all his wives were still alive, because the Scripture says nothing about it. If they are still alive, itis a great thing. 


25. from Simei penalty. 


The question was asked, "Was David right in commanding Solomon his son to punish Shimei, who had cursed him and thrown dirt at him in his flight from Absalom? M. Luther said, "Yes, he did right, for the office of the authorities is to punish the wicked and guilty offenders. One of them said, "Didn't David swear to him before that he would not harm him? Answer: Yes, because he was still alive. 

David had to see a lot through his fingers in such a whimsical, turbulent, evil regiment, as it was all mixed up, that one almost did not know who was cook or waiter, as they say; but after that, now that there was peace in Solomon's time, he punished him through Solomon. 

One must see many things in the regiment at turbulent times, when it is going through each other so strangely, that one must not do when it is quiet and peaceful, as one also speaks in German: One must always give the devil two lights. 


1) Cf. § 2 of this Cap. 


Cap. 60. Of the patriarchs and prophets. § 24-28. 


1431 


The evil must be punished in the end, since only one thing can be put out of God's sight. For David says: Maledixit mihi maledictionem malam: the knave has cursed me evil. 


26. from Ezekia. 


Ezekiel was a very pious king, full of faith, but he fell. For God does not like it that one trusts in his work. No one must go to heaven; he must have forgiveness of sins. . 


27. from Elisao. 


Elisaeus, when he had the forty boys torn apart by two bears, because they called him bald: in this he was justified, for they mocked not him, but his God. As this also is a mockery of Elijah, whereof it is written, Thou man of God: therefore came fire and consumed them. 2 Kings 1:10 ff. 


28. from David. 


There are many strange things in the books of kings. To the mind and to the eyes of the flesh, they seem to be bad, simple books, but in the spirit they are great. Dear David suffered much. Saul tormented him for ten whole years. But he believed that the kingdom was his, and he remained steadfast in it. | would have thrown myself into the breach 2) and run away, saying: "Lord, you deny that | am the king and that | will be martyred. It will also have confirmed and strengthened Saul very much that he had such great luck and that it went according to his will. But David is like a wall, a pious man, and will not lay his hand upon the king, and might well have done so: for he had the word, and when they had the word, they smote him. 

This was followed by Muenzer. He saw that David, Moses, Abraham and others struck. Yes, it is another thing, the work, than the person. The first is the word, which makes the person: the person makes and judges. 


2) d. i. Pants.

the work; that's what he was about. O it is a great thing, because the person has the word, on which he does everything. 

Then said one, David loved Jonathan; he must have been a godly man? Answer: Yes, he was a godly man, and not without faith. He saw that the kingdom was David's, and that it was David's; therefore he besought him, and would not cut him off, nor his own. Jonathan also did signs, when he went over the mountain with his armor-bearer, and smote many Philistines by himself; for he

said to himself: "The Lord who overcomes with many can also overcome through me alone", 1 Sam. 14, 6. 

Then M. Antonius Lauterbach said: "He nevertheless perished miserably. Yes, said D. M. Luther, so often the pious in the church must pay for evil, yet the Son of God was not spared. But | am surprised at David's history, how he could be so cruel that he ordered the rest of Saul's tribe to be exterminated.

1. of the fear of the disciples. (Cordatus No. 743. 744.) 

The apostles were afraid after the resurrection, since the Jews at that time did not intend anything evil against them. But when they had seen what had happened to their Lord, they feared that it would also happen to them; and they were afraid when he entered through the closed doors, because they hardly believed that he had risen from the dead, as they said [Luc. 24:21], "We hoped that he would redeem Israel," as if it was now over.

has the sword, St. Peter has the keys. They were more interested in keys, to lock the boxes, to mice, and to sweep the bags, than in the sword. It is a fable that Caiphas, Pilate, St. Peter should have come to Rome before the emperor, for the histories do not agree in this; one says this, the other that. And | am also moved by this, that Christ died under the emperor Tiberio, who reigned five years after Christ. But all histories unanimously testify that Peter and Paul died under the emperor Nerone, who reigned five and thirty years after Christ's death: but Peter reigned eighteen years after Christ's death in Jerusalem; as the epistle to the Galatians testifies: after that seven years in Antioch. And it is commonly rumored and said that he reigned in Rome five and twenty years after that. 

In all the coronations of the pope some boys go before, with lighted tow, 1) the

throw them up and shout: Pater sancte, sic transit gloria Mundi, memento quod ad annos Petri non pervenies: that is: Holy Father, so the world's honor and splendor pass away, remember that you will not reach St. Peter's years 2c. For no pope has reigned five and twenty years. If one adds it up, Peter should not have been crucified under Nero, because he lacks fifteen years. Summa, the calculation in histories does not agree. St. Lucas writes that St. Paul was free in Rome for a whole year and walked around, but does not remember St. Peter at all. It is dangerous to believe. 


Man does not understand spiritual things from his natural powers. (Lauterbach, March 3, 1538, p. 45.) 


Afterwards Philip said about the weakness of the human nature, which is so unlearned that it cannot understand in the least what is spiritual [i.e. God of the Holy Spirit]. For even the apostles in today's Gospel understand nothing of the cross of Christ, yes, they bear suffering and want to keep Him from it, as Peter does Matth. 16, [22.) | am silent about it, that they themselves should desire to suffer. Luther said: The have well known the prophets, psalms, but as the pop: understands the Scriptures. For the Jewish conceptio of the outward kingdom of Christ was so deep in thei hearts that they could not think of the cross, althoug the kingdom of the Jews was so deeply degrade before the reign of the Persians. For Cyrus restored i to some extent. But from that very presumptuous hop the Jews could not desist. They could not forget th prerogatives, hold hard about it. Oh, that we could hol fast to the true gospel, for the gospel is very gloriou and the declaration of all the prophets. 


4. who made the child faith.

It is a work of th Holy Spirit to make such a great thing so short an simple with powerful and important words.

When M. Luther saw the images of the apostles, s they lay and stood painted, 1) he said: Dear Lord od, how uncertain are the legends of the dear holy postles, and not described. 


5. from St. John's epistles and canonicals. 2) (Cordatus No. 294.) When John had made every effort to write his ospel in such a way that he expressed the essence f the gospel most correctly and appropriately, that is, hat Jesus was the Christ, he was finally forced, while e was still alive, to reverse his language, as it were, nd instead of the salvation that is in Christ, to write in is epistle for the works. The devil rages against the ospel to such an extent that the people who have the ost spiritual things are not able to understand it. The evil is so furious against the gospel that people who ear the most spiritual things abuse them in the most carnal way. 


The apostles’ miraculous signs were necessary. 

As long as Jupiter, Diana and other idolatries and abominable idolatries of the heathen reigned, it was necessary for Christ and the apostles to perform bodily miraculous signs to confirm the doctrine of faith in Christ, and to destroy and cast down all other doctrines and idolatrous worship, and such bodily miraculous signs were to last and take place only until the gospel and baptism were confirmed. But the spiritual miracles and wonders, which Christ considers to be righteous miraculous signs, remain forever, until the end of the world; how is it that the centurion can have such great faith in Christ, who at that time was not present with his sick servant. 

John the Baptist, said D. M. Luther,

1. by betraying, one causes a lot of damage in wars. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1256.) 

There is no city so strong that it cannot be conquered. If only such a large way is open to it that a donkey can carry gold there. 1) Then it is won. Treachery overcomes all cities. This art is best understood by the French. 

(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Jan. 5, 1538, p. 3.) 

On January 5, news came from Austria of a defeat by the Turks and the most shameful escape of our army, which is thrown only by the troops and skirmishers, by the roving lost piles, which is truly very shameful to the great harm that the German warriors are beaten by servants and troops and have lost 26 guns, and almost 800 people have been taken prisoner to Constantinople. Luther said: "It is not right. It is a punishment of sin. Ferdinand is very unhappy. After that he said about the happiness of Maximilian, who, although poor, nevertheless led his army happily. Once, when he had advanced with a small army before Venice, Bartholomew de Signor, 2) the commander, went to him. 


1) This saying is attributed by Cicero (spist. sa /tti6uni I, 16, § 12) to King Philip of Macedonia. (Wrampelmeyer.)

the Venetian, with marvelous boldness and a mighty army, surrounded him in a valley, and sent everywhere that the people should come to the spectacle that he slaughtered the German swine. He wanted to slaughter them, even if God did not want it. But the enclosed army of Maximilian formed a square and since by chance a powder keg was broken, they diligently scattered the powder on the way. After that, the Venetians followed with the army, and since the powder was lit, they broke up; [it] broke up the order, pushed the servants up. In the extreme hardships, Maximilian was lucky; Ferdinand would not like to have that. After that, he said a lot about the Persians and Croats, who had often beaten the Turks. We Germans are too drunk and too sure. The Turkish empire has grown high in thirty years. | hope it will fall in a hurry by the last day; for God cannot bear such bloodshed of His Christians for a long time, because that tyrant slaughters the wretched Christians without any pity and [human] emotion. After that, that messenger assured that Catianus was captured and that he had confessed that he had been bribed by the Turk with four thousand florins. Luther said: "This is how it is. He fights with weapons, with money, with cunning; we snore safely and have unfaithful leaders of the army. For that Catianus is said to be a baptized Jew and to have fled from Spain, overloaded with debts, [that is, as such,] whom they call bankrupt, who is broken through the bank, who is an out-

If Hannibal had had his own historian, he would have undoubtedly left behind the name of the greatest general. He has quite zzaust [torn] the Romans, because he drove them out of Africa, Sicily, Gaul, Spain and almost out of Italy. 


(The following at Cordatus No. 1606.) 


One of the soldiers whom the Margrave had gathered against the Turk came to Luther and said that there was a secret rumor that the gathered soldiers would eventually have to fight against the Duke of Saxony. If this were true, what should he do? He answered: "If you go forward against the Turk, strike because you are mercenaries. But if someone should lead you against the word, you know how to keep yourselves well, so that you do not do something against conscience.

3. unbelief and infidelity among great lords, and of the war against Milan, and of the German warrior nation. 


Maximilianus and King Louis of France had made an alliance with each other, 


1) In the original: [Dicitur] "fugisse ex Hispania aere alieno obrutus, quem ipsi vocant Bancrot, qui per Bancum rupit. Der ei8ern ist worden." There is a mistake in the last words. Perhaps it should be read, "der reitzern ist worden," that is, a runaway because of debt. These words would then be the translation of: hui per Laueniu ruxit.

§ 1-3. 1441 into which they would have liked to have the pope as well. When he agreed to it and, to confirm it, had taken the sacrament in three parts, each a part, the pope broke the alliance and joined the Venetians. When the emperor heard this, he is said to have said: We three, who want to be the heads of Christendom, are the greatest, most desperate, most perjured evil- doers under the sun, being unfaithful not only one to the other, but also to God. But the Pope was defeated, overcome and humiliated by the French before Ravenna on Easter Day. He then secretly sent Cardinal Matthiam Lange, who was now Bishop of Salzburg, to the Emperor, who united them again against the French. Thus the French lost Milan to the Swiss. Around this bride, Milan, which gives annually over ten hundred thousand florins, has now risen above human memory great bloodshed, to this day; for she is very rich and a key in Italy, which city the King of France desired from Emperor Carl again, promising to give him annually a tribute and summa money. But the Emperor wanted to restore and deliver it to his middle son, not to the Dauphin, the eldest, nor even to the youngest, but so that it should not be hereditary; hence came the war. 

And since the Frenchman had only Germans with him, he kept the victory and the field; for Germany gives the best and most loyal men of war, who are content with their pay, and protect the people: are not like Spaniards, who take away property, wife and children, with great infidelity and fornication. They want to be landlords in the house, also have the keys at their side, sweep the boxes; item: use wife and daughters to their will. That is why you do not want anyone to be your guardian. Therefore Antoni de Leva, a Spaniard by birth and one of the emperor's most distinguished and most fortunate captains, admonished the emperor at his last end that he wanted to keep the German warriors dear to him and see to it that he did not lose their favor and good will; if he lost them, it would be all over with him, for they held as one man.

1448 Cap. 63. Of excellent war chiefs and heroes. § 1-6. 


1. by Andrea de Doris. 


It is said that Andreas de Doria, Emperor Carl the Fifth's chief captain, was one of those who, when surrounded by Turks everywhere, was forced by hunger and finally driven to break through the Turks' camp and army with his small band of soldiers and fled into Italy; that he then strengthened himself again and once more forced his way through the Turks' camp and came to the previous place and encamped. This must truly be a manly deed and the work of a great hero, to break through the enemy in this way. 

The rumor came that our people had won against the Turks, but that two thousand men remained. M. Luther said: "Oh, dear God, the battle happened with few pious people. We Germans are too safe and drunken people. The great Tartars, who are much closer to the Turks, he leaves well satisfied, because they are men of war, skilled in robbing and plundering, and can carry their food on horses for two weeks. 


2. from Tamerlan. 


And at that time he also spoke of Tamerlan, the Tartern king, who had defeated the Turk with two hundred thousand men and captured the Turkish emperor: he put him in an iron fence, like a birdcage, and led him around everywhere as a spectacle and a mocking bird. He also met the Turk at once with twice a hundred thousand men, and captured much territory from him. When he besieged a city, he first pitched a white camp and offered them peace. The second time a red one, which meant blood. The third day a black one, which meant destruction and devastation. He was a great tyrant, boasting that he was God's burning wrath and the world's desolation. 


3. from the great Alexander. 


Such an excellent hero and warlord was also King Alexander, who lived a short time, and in twelve years he brought into his 


1449 


He was a monkey, because he destroyed the regiment and the common good. Julius Caesar wanted to imitate him, but he was only a monkey, because he disrupted and destroyed the regiment and the common good. For one sword often keeps another in its sheath. 


4. large and small tare. 


The great Tarts, wild people, are subject to no one, and are a nation of their own; yet they are always in hair, and fight with the Persians and Turks, as the small Tarts fight with the Muscovites and Poles. In sum, God is the Lord and Founder of all kingdoms, principalities and regiments. He changes and gives them to whom He wills, as Daniel says; nor shall we pattern Him, master Him, and be wise. We who cannot know ourselves, much less search out God. For who can search out only his eyes, since the eyeball can grasp heaven? nor do we want to be wise, and master God. 


5. heroes of God's gifts. 


Great people and heroes are special gifts of God, which He gives and sustains, who do not conduct their business and do great deeds with vain imaginations and cold, sleepy thoughts, but are specially moved and driven by God to accomplish their course and work; as King Alexander the Persian brought the kingdom to himself, and after him Julius Caesar the Roman Empire. In the same way, the prophets, St. Paul and other great and excellent people did and accomplished their deeds by the special grace of God; as the book of Judges shows, where it is seen how God gave and took away great things with one person. 


6. from King Alexander. 


When Darius, the Persian king, offered Alexandro peace, he refused and would not accept it. Then Parmenio, his most distinguished councilor, said, "If | were Alexander, | would accept it. But Alexander said, "If | were Parmenio, | would," as if to say, "You are not the man | am. 


1450 Cap. 63. Of excellent war chiefs and heroes. § 7-11. 


1451 





7. papist blindness. (Lauterbach, Nov. 6, 1538, p. 159.) 

The papists' blindness to the revealed truth comes from the fact that they think it was revealed by One Man [Luther], as if Elijah the Thisbite, this beggar, One Man, had not done great things against so many servants of Baal. Likewise, John the Baptist, One Man, in such a short time defeated the Pharisees in such a glorious victory. It is not called One Man, but a man of God. Therefore, heroes are not One Man. 


8. from Joab. (Contained in Cap. 44, § 6.) 


God sometimes gives great miracle workers. 


Some times bring more excellent, great, fine, skilful people. When | was a young boy, there were fine, high, understanding, excellent, magnanimous people, both skillful in counsel and action: like Emperor Maximilian in Germany; King Sigismund in Poland; King Ladislaus in Hungary; King Ferdinand, this Emperor Carl the Fifth's ancestor, in Hispania. Pious, wise and generous princes. Likewise, there were also fine pious bishops, such as the one at Wirzburg, Cologne, who would undoubtedly have accepted this doctrine with a cheerful, joyful heart if they had lived at that time. For | have often heard that they condemned the Pope's superstition and nature. And the bishop of Wuerzburg had a saying when he saw a bad boy: "Ei, in ein Kloster mit dir," he said, "du bist weder GOtt noch den Menschen nuliz. As if he wanted to say: In monasteries only lazy swine and belly slaves feast, who do nothing but eat and drink, fatten themselves, go idle, sleep, laze, and serve no one but themselves, like rat mice. 


10. not all heroes are skilled to monarchy, to rule alone. (Lauterbach, April 3, 1538, p. 52 f.) After that Luther said of the very great virtues of the heroes, of Alexander, of Au 


gustus, Hannibal and Pompey. But not all of them would have been suitable for government, but only for war. For the warriors look only at the victory, not at the empires; such people were Hannibal and Scipio. But Alexander, Julius and Augustus took the empires into consideration. The Turk with his robbery does neither. Alexander was a very great drunkard, strong in body, who, when drunk, is said to have spent three whole days and nights in very deep sleep; the following rule is usually attributed to him: When you are full, lie down, get up and drink again. In this way, one fill drives out the other. This is the rule of Alexander. And yet he marveled at the humility of these heroes, that they took such pains to listen to soothsayers and keep them with them. These were their preachers, whom they followed. But the people were unwilling that they were with the princes. Therefore, such people were considered to be a trustworthy race; they were held dear, as the courtiers now hold the preachers. Summa, one cannot do without the scribes, yes, by them one governs. Then Luther asked Philip about the passage in Revelation (17:6) which says that the Antichrist sheds the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs, where it mentions a twofold blood and indicates an exceedingly great tyranny, external and internal. 


11. from Kunz von der Rose. 


Kunz von der Rose, 1) said D. M. Luther, Maximiliani's servant and a cheerful amusing man, must have been a stout-hearted fellow. For it is said that when he was riding through a forest for some time and was late, he had to go to a single inn in the same forest, where the host was a rogue and a murderer, but he received the guests kindly. There he saw that a virgin inside was very angry, and he secretly asked her why she was crying so much. She said, "There are all murderers inside, so he should be aware of them and beware, she would faithfully guard him.

1. whether to resist the emperor. 

(The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, April 3, Evening, p. 54.) 

The question was raised: Whether it would be permissible to defend ourselves if the emperor took up arms against us? He answered: This is not a theological but a legal question. If he starts a war, he becomes a tyrant against our preaching ministry, but also against the secular regiment and household. There is no question whether one should not fight for religion. Yes, it is necessary to fight for the children and family. If | can, | will write an exhortation to all the world that they should defend their own; but this is my prophecy, that our princes will have peace, and | do not fear war for the sake of religion, but they themselves will sin against civil and domestic justice and invite punishment. It will be about the bishoprics and monasteries, for the emperor holds three bishoprics, Utrecht, Liege and Hildesheim, which he has offered to Brunswick; he thirsts and devours the church estates. Our princes will not suffer this, so they will raise their hoods over it.

But if | am attacked because of the word of God and as a preacher, then this must be endured and the judgment is to be brought home to God. A preacher should not take revenge, therefore | do not take a knife with me in the pulpit, but only on the way. Against robbers | would defend myself. 


(The last three lines of this paragraph are omitted because contained in Cap. 37, § 93.) 


(The following two paragraphs at Cordatus No. 381 and 382.) 


It is said that the German princes are officials, therefore they could defend theirs against the emperor, if, after the concilium, the emperor was ordered by the pope to execute them. But | say, not at all. For | say that the princes are private persons against the emperor. But we will leave this to the jurists to discuss. 

There are three kinds of government: despotic, civil and tyrannical. The despotic wants to have full power, as a householder has over his chickens, cows, etc., which he kills when he wants. Incidentally, according to civil law the servants are subject to the masters, so we are also subject to the emperor by certain laws, and on the other hand he is also bound by certain laws against us. If he transgressed these, he would become a tyrant by oppressing us against law and justice. Moreover, the emperor does not have as great a right over Germany as another king has in his

Rich, because he has neither coin, nor mines, nor customs, and if we theologians said otherwise, namely that one must not resist the evil, then one would speak, as the landgrave said: Herr Doctor, you advise well fine, but how, if we did not follow you ? Item, Anno 1539, the 7th of February, was asked: Whether Christian princes also wanted to resist and defend themselves against the emperor, since he wanted to conquer and war against them for the sake of the gospel? M. Luther answered: "This question has often arisen, has been disputed, and has troubled many people, myself, Pomerania, Philip 2c. But we will deal with it here recently in a few words, and say: First, in worldly affairs, scholars and jurists do not dispute it, but approve and teach to resist the emperor who exercises unjust power, because they say that 


Cap. 64. Of the counter- and emergency defense. § 1. 


1457 


But the Electors are at the same time secular members with the Emperor, and members of the Emperor, to each of whom it is especially incumbent and entrusted to care for the Empire, to promote its best, and to prevent and ward off harm, although not as the most noble and supreme head, like the Emperor. For although the Electors have equal authority with the Emperor, they do not have the same dignity and dignity. These same electors, as far as they are members of the empire and emperor, are secular members and not Christians; therefore they should not be silent in what concerns the empire and their office, but should be careful and do what their duty demands. As an example: Just as a mayor and rector do not govern the city and university alone, but have next to them councilors and collegiates, 


rights permit such a thing; just as one should take a| professors, who are in the regiment and keep them in sword from an insane, foolish man, so that he does} check, persuade them and resist them: if something not do harm. Secondly, economy and natural law} should be done that would be detrimental to the city teach that a son may resist and defend himself] and university, then they should certainly not remain 


against a foolish, delusional father who wants to harm him; but godliness and respectability teach that the son should suffer and be killed rather than strangle his father. Thirdly, reason also teaches that if the head is mad and senseless and wants to destroy the other members, he should be controlled, resisted and bound. 

But in theology it is argued differently when one asks: Is it proper for a Christian to resist the emperor who exercises unjust authority, because the Scripture teaches that one should suffer injustice from the authorities? Rom. 13, 2. 1 Petr. 2, 13. 

1) Answer: In the secular realm and body, the emperor is the head, whose body is every subject and private person's piece and limb, to whom, as a secular and civil person, the rights of emergency defense are left, even commanded and called; for since he does not defend himself, he is a killer of his own body. 

2) Secondly, the emperor is not a monarch and is the only ruler in the German Empire, just as the king of France and England are monarchs in_ their kingdoms and rule alone. 


silent nor watch, and let the heads do as they wish. In the same way, the princes and other princes of the empire shall also The princes of the empire shall also defend the emperor, because he wants to do something improper against God and rights. 

Moreover, when the emperor deposed one of the electors, he deposed them all, which he should not be allowed to do. Therefore, before we finally answer this question: Whether the emperor should remove the electors or the electors should remove and kill the emperor, it has already happened. Therefore, a proper distinction must be made here, namely: A Christian leads two kinds of persons, namely, a religious or spiritual one, and the other, a civil or secular one. The believing or spiritual one suffers everything, neither eats nor drinks, does not beget children, 2c., nor does not take on this worldly being or doing. The civil, however, is subject to worldly rights and laws, and is obliged to obey, must defend and protect itself and its own, as the laws command. 

Now if a bad guy, regardless of what kind of person he is, wants to violate my wife and virgins, and watch me 


1458 Cap. 64. of the counter- and emergency defense. § 1. ' 1459 


| would truly put Christian 1) back and use the worldly person, strangle him in the work, or cry for help. For in the absence of authority, since it cannot be had, there is the law of the people, which allows one to call upon neighbors for help. For Christ and the gospel do not abrogate worldly rights and order, nor reprove them, but confirm and confirm them. 

Summa, because the emperor is neither a monarch nor a lord who rules alone; but the electors are in equal power and administration with him, so that he does not have the power nor the right to make laws and orders alone: much less does he have the power, the authority nor the right to draw the sword and to overrun the subjects and members of the empire, unknowingly of the right, and without the prior knowledge and consent of the entire empire. Therefore, Emperor Otto wisely and well did and ordered that he placed the seven Electors next to the Emperor, 2) otherwise the Empire would not have stood for long. 

This question was not difficult in the time of the apostles, for then all the authorities were Gentiles, not Christians: but now, because the princes are also Christians, or ever want to be, it is difficult to conclude; for a prince and a Christian are the closest relatives. 

Above that, the emperor has only a civil and political regiment, rules over free people, is not alone lord, does not have under him and in his complete power serfs, who should be subject to him, and only do and suffer everything he wanted, without any difference and condition, as a horse, cow, donkey 2c. is under the power of its master, who owns it and is powerful; what he wants, it must do, is driven and beaten. The political regime, as Aristotle writes, has many different degrees and pieces: first, monarchia, where one alone is master and rules, as France, England, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Denmark is 2c. Secondly, as the most noble and best, so with understanding, honor and virtue- 


1) Le. the Christians. 2) Cf. cap. 27, § 35, zii end. 


who are gifted above others, have the rule, as in Germany and the Roman Empire, and in Venice. Thirdly, Democratia, since many of the common man rule, as in Switzerland and Ditmars. Fourth, oligocratia, 3) where few of them rule, as in Erfurt. 

Finally, one should also know this: Since the emperor wants to invade us and wage war against us, he does it not for himself, on his own authority, but for the sake of the pope, in his stead, as his liegeman and sworn servant, who would support himself to defend the pope's tyranny and atrocious idolatry. For the pope does not ask anything about the gospel. Therefore, if he disputes the gospel and starts a war over it, he wants to protect and preserve his authority, power and tyranny through the emperor. Therefore neither the emperor for his own person, nor for the sake of the gospel wars against us; but the person of Pabst, the godless archbishop, in order to preserve his abominations, wants to invade us and wage war against us. Therefore, one should not remain silent and sit still. 

But since one would reproach and say: David, being chosen of God to be king, and anointed of Samuel, would not resist king Saul, nor lay his hand upon him: so shall we not resist Caesar. 2c. Answer: David had his kingdom then only by promise, not in posse, that is, it was only promised to him, but he was not in possession nor in command. But here, in this matter, we are not fighting against Saul, but against Absalom, against whom David made war, and Joab killed the rebel Absalom. 

Luther said: "He would like to argue about this matter, whether the emperor should be resisted and defended? Although natural and secular laws and jurists allow it, it is a dangerous question among theologians for the sake of the saying Matth. 5, 39: "If someone strikes you on one cheek, hand him the other also"; and 1 Petr. 2, 18: "You servants, be subject with all fear. 


3) So Stangwald instead of Olicratia. 


1460 Cap. 64. Of counter- and emergency defense. § 1-3. 1461 


the Lord, not only the kind and gentle, but also the whimsical." 

Therefore, we must be sure that we do not do anything contrary to God's word, and then be tormented and tortured in our conscience in such a dangerous matter. Therefore, one must properly distinguish a Christian from a worldly person, both of whom can be a Christian. For Christ does not abolish worldly authority and rule. If a murderer or highwayman wanted to kill me and take what is mine, | would truly need the political and secular person against him, and would not suffer his rage, but would defend myself as long as | could, | would take action. Therefore, this dispute is de facto, non de jure, what happens with the deed, not what should happen with rights. And it is not against peace, where counter- and emergency defense is permitted and allowed. But that a Christian may defend himself against his authorities is a matter of great concern. 

He repeated and repeated again this question: Whether one would like to defend oneself against the overlord, who suddenly attacks one and acts against rights, also with a good conscience? Answer: The lawyers have played an evil game with the emperor, he has given away the sword, so that we have the handed over sword in our possession, gladium traditum possessorium. The emperor, however, has only gladium petitorium over us, must ask and seek it from us, since he wants to punish with it, because he alone can do nothing with rights, without the knowledge and unanimous consent of the princes, princes, and the whole empire. 

These are not the times, as in the time of the martyrs, when Diocletianus alone ruled and tyrannized against the Christians. Now there is another empire, since the emperor rules with the seven princes, therefore his power is nothing without the seven; indeed, if one does not pollute, it is nothing. It is no longer a monarchy, since the regiment rests with one alone, as it did with the Turk. But if it were Diocletianus, and such a regiment, we would gladly yield to him and suffer. Nor do | hope that such a case will come to pass, nor that the emperor 





If he were to become an Arian and publicly fight against God's word for himself, as an un-Christian and a pagan, then one should give way to him and suffer. Summa, | take the sword to the pope, not to the emperor; for the pope shall not be an authority nor a tyrant. 


2. brief list of the arguments and summaries of Luther's concept on the warning to the Germans, from the Nothwehr. 1) 


First of all, the emperor has neither the right nor the power to command this, that is certain; and since he gives it immediately, one should not obey him. 

Secondly: | neither stir up nor cause a riot, but forbid and ward off the same. Let them see to it that they do not cause one, because they mandate and command what is unjust and against God, for | cannot turn it away afterward, nor control and ward it off. It is in vain for them to say, "Behold, these are the fruits of schism, discord and dissension. They want it so, so let it be done to them. 

Third, do not joke too much: if you fools make Luprian drunk, see that he does not feed you in the bosom, for he is otherwise thirsty enough and likes to be filled. 

The fourth: Well then, if you want to win, bow your heads in blessing. As good a cause as you have, so happy victory give you God. | D. M. Luther, your apostle, have told you, and admonished you, as | have been guilty. 


3. deceit Against D. Luthern. 


You despise my teaching and want to see Luther in his words as the Pharisees did to Christ. But if | wanted to, as | do not want to, | would have a gloss that such resistance is not against the emperor, but against H[archduke] G[eorg]. And that a

| say to you that you should not resist evil" 2c., there are many different solutions and answers. Some say that there are private and particular, own 


1466 


Revenge is forbidden, but it is also forbidden by Moses in the law, otherwise the kingdom and reign could not have existed. That is why Christ does not rebuke special, own, self-willed, but public, common, and official revenge, otherwise he would have taught nothing more than Moses. For Christ says to his own: But you are not like this. Here three kinds of solutiones and responsibilities are given. The first, as the scholars in schools call it, ab instantia, that one throws another in the way and resists, namely, that it must be understood from the self-powerful and private speech, otherwise it would be unacceptable, yes, Christ reproves the worldly government and the authorities, which his opinion has not been, nor is; but he confirms it, as established by God, Proverbs 8, 15. 16. 1 Mos. 9, 6. 2 Chron. 19, 6. 10. Rom. 13, 1. ff. Matth. 26, 52. The other, that a distinction is made, namely, that the gospel only has to do with spiritual things, does not concern itself with worldly things. The third, that Christ here does not forbid anything that Moses forbade, but only teaches against the abuse of the law that was then among the people. The last one is a bit too weak. The first and previous answers do not rhyme with the form and essence of the argument, but they indicate that it is neither appropriate nor rhyme. 

| do not know, so that | may also indicate my thoughts, whether this may be the right solution and understanding, that Christ speaks plainly of the law, and teaches that the righteousness of faith condemns the worldly and civil or external human righteousness, so that they should not think that they are therefore righteous before God, that they do not quarrel nor right before the court; and if such were to happen, and let them take everything willingly, yet the righteousness of the law would not be the right righteousness that is valid before God 2c. So that he teaches both against political and civil worldly righteousness, and against the righteousness that God demands in the law.

understand public vengeance and official punishment. As if he wanted to say v. 39: "You shall not resist evil," that is, suffer it. Item v. 40: "Whoever wants to be right with you in court" 2c. There he means the authorities: "Will the authorities compel you by force? This is a force of the tongue; the other is and happens with the deed and the work. 


9. emergency defense.

(10) Whether to put to death a tyrant who acts contrary to justice and equity according to his pleasure. 


A private and common man, who is in no public office or command, is not to be killed, even if he could; for the fifth commandment of God says: Thou shalt not kill. But if | were to seize a man, even if he were nota tyrant, by my wife or daughter, | would surely kill him. Item: If he should take by force this man's wife, another man's daughter, a third man's land and goods, and the citizens and subjects should come together, and could no longer tolerate nor suffer his violence and tyranny, they would put him to death, as they would another murderer and highwayman.

It has happened in Germany around a good world regiment. The dukes already know nothing but to buy beautiful stallions and spurs, and in the meantime, while they worry about it, the nobles rule and lead the princes into all troubles, ruin and death, as it happened to our duke before Meiningen. 1) when they put him before the guns with his whole army and then ordered him to flee. Matthias [Corvinus of Hungary] was a very good ruler, who pressed on with cutting off heads. 

(The following Lauterbach, July 21, 1538, p. 100.) 

On this day Eustachius von Schlieben 2) was there, whom D. Jonas praised because of his wisdom and godliness and that he had spoken evil of the Roman court. Although he had been in Italy for five years, he had remained in Rome only a few weeks because of the great wickedness of the Roman court, where there was so much contempt for God, perjury, 2c., that false oaths were taken every day for the sake of money, and he had been offered twenty ducats to swear falsely. When he rejected this, he would have been ridiculed: That beast will not take an oath for twenty ducats. Luther said: "Whoever has seen through the nature of the Roman court only to some extent will recognize that it is the realm of the devil. That is why the bishop of Mainz is a limb unfit for this body, who no longer has a conscience and, accustomed to acts of murder and robbery, dares to do anything. He not only strangled Hans Schantzen, but also took all his property from his heirs. Now his chamberlain has also been lost 2).

8. those of the nobility cannot rule. 


Those of the nobility presume and want to rule, but they cannot yet understand it. The pope, however, not only knows, but can also govern by deed. A bad pope can rule better than a hundred of the nobility at our court. 


9. princes’ rights from nobility. 4) 


The wickedness of the world is so great that when a prince learns and studies the Latin language, the nobility and the councilors fear that he will be too learned and too clever for them, and say: "Damn it! 2c. What? does E. F. Gn. want to become a scribe? He must become a ruling prince, must learn worldly affairs, and what belongs to cavalry and war, so that country and people are protected and preserved, 2c. that is, remain a fool, whom we may lead around with the nose like a bear. 

But Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony, once said: "We certainly hear what our advisors advise, but we do not always follow them, except in what we ourselves recognize as right and good. But what kind of faithful advisors these are, who keep the princes from studying and discourage them, everyone may well assume and think. 


10. one of the nobility ungodly and mocking speech against D. M. Luthern. (Cordatus No. 1629.) 

One of nobility, who was an enemy to me, once said, "Are you the holy man? Dear, when you go to [the] heaven, you will not dust my eyes. To whom | replied, "My dear nobleman, it may well happen that | would like to stupefy you, and | would not be able to reach you. 


11. the nobility is not good to the citizens. 


Citizens and peasants are separated by the wall. Cities are only of those of the nobility latrocinia, plucking and robbing. Therefore, those of the nobility are not good to the urban.

The 66th chapter. 


Of lawyers. 


1. that the jurists are concerned only with the secular regime. 2. from the saying Ps. 2, 2: The lords counsel 2c. 3. another one from the lawyers. 4. D. Luther's serious disputation with the jurists. 5. a pious lawyer is a strange animal. 6. D. Luther's warning to the jurists. The majority of lawyers are servants of the pope. 8. procuratores are tongue-thrashers. 9. of the secular rights. 10. few lawyers are blessed. 11. where pious lawyers get their theology from. The holy scripture approves the right. The natural right is twofold. 14. lawyers should have conscience. 15. what lawyers are. 16. D. Luther's Prophecy of Jurists and Theologians. 17. why the lawyers strut. 18. D. Luther's divination of lawyers. 19. from the pagan rights. 20. by lawyers, from the sermon, so D. Luther on the Feast of the Three Kings from the prophet Micah in 1544. 21. by jurists, that one should not approve nor permit secret betrothal. 22 Another sharp admonition to the jurists. 23 Another different one from the lawyers. 24. faithful admonition and warning, especially to the jurists, and how one may blessedly study in law. 25. of rights and courts. 26. jurists do not know from the spiritual law any cause to indicate why the pope forbade the priests to marry. Luther does not want to suffer lawyers to teach him to preach. 28. that it is dangerous to be a lawyer. Jurists and regents must believe the testimony of witnesses, and speak and judge accordingly. 


1. that the jurists are concerned only with the secular regime. 


Before me, said D. Martinus has not been a lawyer who knew what is right before God. They have what they have from me. It is not written in the Gospel that one should worship lawyers. It is nothing to say: God and man. If our Lord wants to judge God, what does he care about the lawyers? Before the world | will let them be right, but before God they shall be under me. If | can judge Moses and put him under me, what should the lawyers do?

2Ps, 2,2 Principes convenerunt in unum: The lords consult with one another. Which saying D. M. Luther then interpreted it over

This is what David himself says, that against his Son shall be the authority, wisdom, and multitude of the world; and he shall be against the many alone, against the wise a fool, against the mighty impotent. This is a strange rule. Our Lord God lacks nothing but wise men. But behind it all, it is said: Et nunc, Reges, intelligite etc. Let yourselves therefore be instructed, O kings 2c. 


3. one different from lawyers. 


The theologians do not like the canons of the jurists and the pope's decree, they also stand as they like. They remain in their secular rights and laws and orders; but if they fall into the canons and into the Pabst's mud, they must go to ruins, they shall not resist it. 

| do not want to harm the lawyers; | only want to take the Catechismum and strike them with it, and make them so afraid that they do not know where to stay with their rights; and | do not want to touch the gospel, but keep it on the thrust. 

D. Jerome is a sharp jurist who loves equity. And when D. Martinus was at M.'s wedding, it was thought how and from what the ecclesiastics should be maintained? D. Martinus asked the doctor: "Mr. Jerome, don't you think, because the pope is feeding us all, that we would become papists again, according to the common saying: whose bread we eat, whose song we sing? Jerome answered, "| also praised the verdict. 

If there is a jurist in all of Germany, yes, in the whole world, who knows what law is, both in fact and in law, | am surprised. (This is a great oath, if | swear thus, said D. Martinus.) 1) For according to divine law, law is divided into secular or imperial law, and fist law or deed law. So God has

Emperor Carln gave the right, which is made right in fact; but the fact does not make it right. He who has the right of fist or of deed can also easily have the right in the right; that is what he wants, that must be right. 

In sum, if the lawyers will not ask for forgiveness of sins and crawl to the Gospel, | will mislead them, so that they will not know where from. | do not understand the right, but |am a master in the right, in matters that concern the conscience. 


(Cordatus No, 27 and 1029.) 


The jurists say it is dangerous to define; but that with which the theologians deal must be constant; it behooves them. To teach certain things. What else should a doubting conscience do, which desires comfort, if one answers with opinions and not with firm, certain doctrine? 

The study of law is a very dirty business, and if it were not for the money, no one would stoop to this study. Tomorrow a new adder will be made against the theologians. 2) 


4. Serious disputation of D. M. Luther with the jurists. (Cordatus No. 621. 622 and No. 702.) 


Since two doctors of law came to me, | received them like this: O you jurists, | could easily carry you, if you were based on the laws and not on the canons. But since you are doctors of both rights, you defend the pope and his canons more than the laws and the emperor, and | wanted to give my hand that all canonists and papists should have their canons, | did not want to wish them an angry devil. The Bishop of Mainz could not have three bishoprics, which you defend. You lawyers, do not trample us underfoot, otherwise we would like to bite your heels. 

A Doctor Juris is a monster [chimaera], that is nothing at all, namely a [Doctor] of canon law, because they are forced to say and judge what the pope says and judges. But all,

D. Martinus about the poverty and misery of the theologians, how they were plagued and oppressed everywhere, especially by those of the nobility. And turned to D. Melchior and said: "You lawyers help us honestly, and you also press us hard. But | would advise you not to do so and not to reach out to the nobility. For if the theologians fall and lie down, you lawyers must also fall and lie down. 

But when D. Kling wanted to excuse himself and the faculty, D. Martinus said. Martinus said: | admonish and warn you, do not press us too hard, or you shall be paid. Then L. Blank said: | am also a lawyer, but an innocent one, | have studied several hundred guilders in law, and only earned eight Markische Groschen with it, nor do | have a conscience about it. And he said this with great seriousness. 


7) Several lawyers are servants of the pope. 


All who serve the pope are condemned, for according to the devil there is no worse man than the pope, with his lies and human statutes, than those who are strictly against Christ; therefore he is also the antichrist. The jurists, the largest group, with very few exceptions, who are despised by others, especially by the canonists, are the pope's servants: even if they do not want to have the name, they prove it by deed, they want to rule the church and trample on its faithful servants; therefore they are damned. 

There is evil in the world," he said, Martinus, "because people do not want to honor church servants, teachers and preachers; even if they are honored, they soon become proud. 


8. procuratores tongue depressor. 


Tongue-thrashers go before the learned in the world, for they can open the mouths of the unlearned and the rabble with their washing and chattering, and turn a nose with a sham and cover of the right. Just as the priest at Jessen 1) should have me here 


1) The pastor in Jessen was Wolfgang Brauer (Seidemann p. 167). 


. 66. of juristm. §6-13. 


1479 


in two sermons. So the world wants to be deceived; look only at what shines and shines high. Truth, as bad and simple as it is, it cannot and will not suffer. 


9. secular rights. 


Secular or imperial law is nothing other than what human reason spins, casts and orders from natural law. Spiritual law, however, is nothing other than what the pope wants and dreams. And because the papacy is founded by the devil, his rights, which do not agree with God's and natural law and justice, but are contrary to it, are also the devil's foundation and order; they appear and shine as they please, let them be approved and accepted by whoever wishes. 


10. few lawyers are blessed. (Contained in Cap. 22, § 2.) 


11) Where pious lawyers get their theologiam. 


That some lawyers believe and are Christians, they have not learned from their art and law books, but from me and from the holy scriptures; as the lansquenets believe, because | have instructed and taught them that a man of war can wage war with a good conscience. So also, many monks and nuns believe that | have written it thus. And | believe it. 


The right approves the holy scripture. 


The theologians approve the imperial and secular rights from God's word, therefore we theologians execute, drown, break to death; the jurists do not do it, could not do it and should not do it even with a good conscience. As happened in the papacy, where the authorities "themselves did not want to pronounce judgment on blood, but had it done by other bad people. For "what is not done by faith is sin," says St. Paul Romans 14:23. 


13. of course right is two things. 


Natural law is twofold: firstly, as regards words; secondly, as regards the thing 


1480 


itself. As for the words, it is right; but as for the thing itself, it is wrong. For if the theology were not the word of God, saying, "There is one God," then justice would be called force, for he who has it in his hand does it. But whether such power is right, our Lord God will dispute. 


14. lawyers should have conscience. 


You lawyers, only hold fast that you have only conscience, and believe that there is a right, as it must be right, because it is God's order, and established by Him, as Proverbs 8, 14. 15. 16. the wisdom of God speaks: "Mine is both counsel and action. | have understanding and power. Through Me kings rule, and the rulers establish justice. By Me princes and all rulers reign." As there are few who believe it. Just as there are now many people who believe that the theology now revealed is nothing. This happens because we are still alive; what will it become after our departure? So also many of them are pregnant with it; they want to bring it to the point that the rights should be nothing. 


15. what lawyers are. 


A jurist is a beam bearer; a theologus a splinter bearer. And a doctor juris is a beam doctor; a theologus a splinter doctor. 

A lawyer is wise according to human wisdom; but a theologian is wise according to God's wisdom. Many are more learned than | am, but that they should be more learned in the Word of God, which | teach and preach, is impossible. | will leave a shoemaker, a tailor, a lawyer, and every one of them; but if one challenges me in the preaching seat, | will send him down, and he shall be astonished. A lawyer is no more than a cobbler or tailor. 


16. D. M. Luther's Prophecy of Jurists and Theologians. 


You lawyers, said D. Martinus to Peter Weller, will go to ruins; but we must go with you. For in St. Petro, 2 Ep. 2, 


"Cap. 66. of the jurists. §13-18. 


1481 


It is written of those "by whom the way of truth is blasphemed. When this happens, when blasphemy comes, the curtain of the temple is torn. 

Item: If a jurist does not know more than the terminos juris and the words of rights, he is a pure fool. The jurists deal with worldly and temporal, perishable things and cases; but the theologians with heavenly, spiritual things and cases of conscience. 


17. why the lawyers strut. 


The lawyers have realized that we theologians approve and praise the rights that are not against God and His Word. Therefore they now become proud. But if they make too much of it, | will separate the concretum and abstractum, the right custom from the abuse, the persons from the right, just like the paint from the wall, from each other and instead. This is what | tell them. They may well consider who and what they are. For a lawyer who is no more than a lawyer is a poor thing. What is jus? (which little word in Latin also means soup) and are the lawyers only soup eaters, for they only discuss dirty deeds, the seventh commandment: Thou shalt not steal; and such temporal things. 

The lawyers, Medici, artists vex us theologians, and also the peasants. But when it comes to the meeting, theologia alone must help. And it is impossible for anyone to become a truly good theologian, if God himself makes him one. 


18. divination D. Martini by lawyers. 


Because | am alive, the jurists shall, if God wills, have nothing to do with the Pope's decrees; but if | am now laid low and dead, you will see how it will go. Before | began to write, the lawyers all lived as despondent, poor, troubled people, because of their consciences: they finally had to despair, did not know that honest, good, worldly rights are God's order, and that one can also serve God with them; yes, if it comes and happens from faith in Christ. Like a doc- 


1482 


tor Juris at Erfurt, when he was to die, said: O who would not have been a jurist, but a hermit or monk! and ordered that he should be buried in a monk's cap 2c. And D. Jerome once said to me: If | had ten sons, none of them should become a lawyer for me. But now they want to throw at us, because they have learned from and through us what they are. Well, they look forward, | can still throw one in their beard. 


19. pagan rights. 


If it were not for the rights of the heathen in the Roman Empire, our princes, emperors and kings would all have become fools. The rights of the Pabst are the most foolish, because they smell, even stink of vain hope and ambition, and desire to rule and reign. The rights of the heathen are better and more honest than those of the supposed Christians. But the Pabst's laws are the worst: and what is good in them is taken from the imperial laws. The decrees are the pope's law, 1) and rule the world; but the decree is no longer respected. Gratianus, who read the decree together, was an ass who did not understand anything when he wrote the decree. 

With the jurists, the canons remain in_ their authority and prestige, but with us there is no Bachant, he wants to master the Scriptures. The jurists have the practices, that is why they stand firm; we theologians lack them, that is why it is the same with us. The jurists have to practice and put their thing into practice, otherwise they could not continue; if we also practiced our theology and experienced it in persecution and challenge, then we could also do it right. 


20. by lawyers, from the sermon, so D. Martinus has done against them at the holy three Kings Days, Anno 1544, from the prophet Micah. 


But we are to take note and learn rightly what the reign of this Bethlehemite Lord and King of Christ is, that 


1) Thus Stangwald instead of: "Reich. 


Cap. 66. Of the disciples. § 18-20. 





1483 


to make a proper distinction between temporal and spiritual rule. For he shall not be a vassal, as emperors, kings, princes, or as | am lord of the house; but he shall redeem Israel. This is an excellent, joyful, lovely prophecy, that such a Lord shall come out of Bethlehem, who shall not war nor slay, but shall help and counsel; so that we may say, Christ is a Mushel (that is, such a Lord, who is commanded to do something), is not a tyrant in his rule. 

My thoughts are now these: We have written that one should distinguish between the regiments: so | have now urged our lawyers to wash their fur; they do not want to learn from us that they made a distinction between the Beghlehemitic and the imperial regiment. For | cannot suffer them to exalt themselves above this lord. | do not, you say? Yes, you do, you want to bring the pope back in, as they (the jurists) are good papists and princes. | am not here to learn from them what is right, but | want to teach them; and | would not suffer a thousand of them to be above me. 

This is the right of the pope, to which they cling, like the devil in the butt, de clandestinis matrimoniis, of secret betrothals. Then the pope and the lawyers said that the marriage could never be divorced. What happened? The spouses disagreed and divorced again. It happened the same way to me in the monastery; or, when they came before the official, one swore to the other, and they divorced again. Afterwards they came to me or to another in confession and said: Dear Lord, | now have a wife to whom | have secretly sworn; how do | do it more and more? Help me, dear doctor, so that | do not despair. For Greta, to whom | first became engaged, is my true wife. But this Barbara, who trusts me after this, is not my wife, and yet must | sleep with her? | may not take her, whom | would like to have, since it could be; but now | cannot: for | have another, so she also has another; but no one knows that she is my wife.

It is done for God's sake, out of a great zeal to keep 


O | am damned, | know no counsel? Behold, | must} the teaching of the gospel pure, otherwise and 


say that you lawyers see how you have ruled in the past. Then the pope went with his junks, the lawyers, and said that he should stay with the one with whom he had publicly married and held the wedding, and yet consider Greta, with whom he had secretly engaged himself, in his heart as his rightful wife, but he should not sleep with the one whom he had publicly led to the church, nor demand the marriage duty from her, or provoke her to evil desire, otherwise he would break the marriage with her. So he could not have her, and he could not leave the other one; for friendship does not suffer that you would leave the one with whom you have publicly gone to church. So the lawyers have advised, as their books, the pope's decree, show, they cannot deny. Counsel in a thousand devils' names 


without that | would let them wait for their thing. But they want to interfere with Christ and rule and confuse the consciences; that is not to be suffered. 

Truly, | would not have thought that we should still have such coarse, impolite jurists, in part, here, who have had the word of God so abundantly, purely and clearly, now for some thirty years, that everyone, especially the jurists, should have read our books. But they do not look at them, so | will not look at them again: must not be ashamed to pretend such shameful doctrine, to quarrel, and still want to be right, that they thus confuse the consciences. For all their doings must be so erroneous and confused that they themselves do not know what their position is. 

Item: More they say: If one is accused before a

and written, for the comfort and instruction of poor consciences, that secret vows should be forbidden. Thereupon the laudable Elector of Saxony, H. J[ohann] F[riedrich], has commanded that secret vows should not be permitted. And the lawyers shall not overthrow it, no matter how curly, clever and splendid they may be. But when they are questioned, they speak: What do we ask about it, the theologians will carry it out and answer for it, we let them take care of it. We must, according to our duties, speak from and according to the rights described, what is right 2c. 

Thank the devil! Why won't you leave us alone? What is the Lord Christ's rule to you? Is that what it means to be a lawyer, not to look at one's own conscience or to consider what he does? So the devil is also called a lawyer; he is their doctor, with whom they go to school. | would not have thought that we still had such lawyers here. | am angry, dear people, forgive me. 


witnesses. (The rough asses do not know what the saying means). 

Yes, what should the good judge do? He knows the defendant is innocent. Should he condemn him on the testimony of such witnesses, against his conscience? because he knows that he has been wronged. Then the jurists comfort him thus: Because you judge know that the man is wronged, you know this as a private person, for yourself, not as a judge who is to speak secundum allegata et probata, according to what has been presented and proven; it does not concern you, because you are not legally required to be a witness in the proper way 2c. But they comfort the defendant thus: Since you, they say, know that you are wronged, surrender yourself to the judgment seat: let it pass over you, and suffer the wrong. 

So do our proud noblemen and lawyers here in Wittenberg, and they think, 


1) This number, which is found in all editions, cannot be correct. It may well read: "about thirty years. 


1486 


They are right to do so. They do not read our books, they are called Catholics, they do not ask anything about our Lord God, and they do not look at our church. Well then, because they do not consider D. Pommern a bishop of this church, nor me their preacher; so they shall not be in this church either, | will not consider them my sheep either, because they do not hear my voice, and | will show them a hole to the door. If they want to be the pope's hypocrites and swarmers, let them remain so, go our idle way, and leave our church satisfied. 

Now, back to the matter: To the husband | would thus say: Dear friend, the woman to whom you have secretly pledged it is not your wife, for such a betrothal is neither flush before God nor right 2c. And to the judge: Dear judge, you shall speak: | bear witness that the man is innocent: if there were ten thousand witnesses, and | know for certain that the man is innocent, | cannot and will not condemn him. 

Yes, say the lawyers, you do against the emperor's right! | throw, with leave, in such law, which does injustice to the poor man. But so many witnesses against him! So | say: How many false witnesses have there been since the beginning of the world? Christ was killed by false witnesses, Stephen was stoned 2c. Witnesses can be false and instigated, and bribed with money or otherwise. The judge shall say: It has happened more that false witnesses have stood up, therefore, because | know that this man is wronged, | cannot condemn him. 

Therefore, we do not want to suffer from the nasty jurists, because they have no conscience, nor do they ask much about the danger of conscience, and do not allow them to argue about God's word and law. Whether they already say: There are the witnesses: because one cannot reject them, one should accept and admit them, and judge according to their testimony. So we theologians say: We do not look at the false witnesses, God's right is thus, your right shall yield to it. And even though we have often said it, the proud jurists consider us to be vain fools, and say in addition: "They do not look at us with our

theology, but want to stick to their right. 

Therefore | do not want to suffer that they cause a perplexity in my church, and want to confuse the consciences with their abused right. Should we allow the proud Junkers the arrogance that they do not recognize Doctor Pommern as a bishop of this church, nor do they consider me as a preacher, but only what they say and pretend shall be valid and right? They shall not live this down, and their arrogance shall be broken and controlled, so that they shall not revile the Christian congregation of God, which our dear Elector at Augsburg confirmed at the Imperial Diet, and all his land and people, life and limb, thereby added to it; or they themselves shall be reviled. 

They think they want to sneak in again with the pope and please the bishop of M[ainz]. Well, since they do not consider us bishops and pastors, we must not be ashamed again, and consider and declare them to be papists and devil's children. For this is the serious command of our Lord. Lord's serious command that we should keep the church government pure, distribute and administer the word of God, absolution, and the sacraments according to Christ's institution, and comfort the consciences; yet they ridicule it, and consider us fools, and want to hold above the pope's law. Well then, | will see if they will set their false, untruthful law above God's true Word and Scripture. 

So that | explain it with an example: We have often preached and taught (although the jurists consider us to be bachants) that if M. Fréschel took a wife after the first or second death, then he is not a digamus who has two or more wives, as the jurists understand it; therefore they consider him to be no preacher or pastor, because he has had two wives. 

Dear, look, where are we at home? They have to leave our church, and they should not be in it, but we want to expel them 1) from the chair in which they are standing, because they sneak in again with the pope. We do not want to suffer that the consciences are thus deceived.

since they will continue in this way, we want to drive them out of the church to the devil, and we want to know that the consistory is not to stand in their right, but it is to be under the parish priest. 

| would not have believed that our lawyers should still be papists. Well then, | will also act against them with all my might; for | know that their thing is dirt, as far as the conscience is concerned: but they have no conscience, take a thaler or ten, and serve evil things, with the appearance of the right, so they decorate them, make them a waxen nose. If they do not win, they have nevertheless earned the money. 

This | say to you young fellows who want to become lawyers, not to frighten you, but to remind and admonish you that you want to become pious, honest and sincere lawyers. For the law is right, but do not follow your preceptors in abuses and wicked practices: do not flutter about in unrighteous matters, as if no one could be a lawyer, for he would have to use such wicked practices. No, rights are not given by| God for this reason, that one should make right out of wrong, and make wrong out of right, as the unchristian lawyers do, who only study law for the sake of money. Do not be offended or mistaken by this; nevertheless, study diligently. 





longer; but in the meantime you must give me ten thalers on the hand. If you want to do that, then count them. 

They prove that this is true by their works, deeds and lives; then they go away and become pious, like Reinicke Fuchs, and say that they cannot carry it out or maintain it, when the poor man has put a lot of great expense, effort and work into it, and has well filled their hands. Well, he says, if you cannot, then someone else can; so such a silver lawyer says, "Well, if someone else earns the money, then | can do the art too," and he wears one on his head for it; remember, God gives where the thalers fly from, they are good in the kitchen. So he accepts it with an evil conscience and says: "Well, | will see how | can help and do my best; but there must be money, without that | do not know how to advise you. 

Dear fellow, study otherwise in the right, or you are damned and go into the abyss of hell. You say that you want to raise it, although you know that the thing is evil: you help to decorate it finely, paint it with a fine dye, hang it with legal sayings, with the hair pulled to it, so that you can make a noise before the eyes of the people.

God would let the world sink for the sake of such disgraceful jurists: one should tear the tongue out of the throat of such proud drops and rabbles. So they make it so that no poor man of right may console himself: for, if he comes into the right, then the matter is lost, if one has no more thalers to give, and can no longer fill such boys' hands.

21. by lawyers, that one should not approve nor permit secret betrothal. 


| let the jurists do what they can in the secular government. But if they are subordinate and want to govern the church, then they are not lawyers who should hold above that which is right, but canonists and asses' heads. Now they, the greatest number, secretly consider betrothal to be a thing that can be suffered, therefore they must also abrogate God's word when, according to the Pope's Ca. 


and has trampled them underfoot, and still commands his subjects not to be obedient to them, and has set them free from their oaths and duties 2c. But where is it written? The devil in the butt hole. If he were God's servant, he would do like the apostles, who teach that one should be obedient to the authorities, 1 Petr. 2, 13, as Christ also says Matth. 22, 21: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." So the devil's head sets himself above and against God; as he has deposed many emperors and kings, as Emperor Henry, incited the son against the father, and brought him with great torture under the earth 2c.; yes, he does it so that no one can say enough about it. 

Because secret betrothals are created and written by the devil and the pope, his creatures and beautiful fruits, and are an accursed work of the devil, therefore everyone should resist and control it, who only can and should, as preachers, lawyers, judges 2c. And since the parents are willing to do so, eloquent and moved by the pope's law, which is so deeply ingrained and rooted in the heart that it cannot easily be torn out again, as we see and experience, it is nevertheless a forced and unwilling will, a cold and lazy yes, like a poor thief who is to be hanged, since he says, "I would gladly die," 2c. when he would much rather remain alive if he did not have to. Yes, the devil works and finally gets there, as he is then a thousand-fold who does not celebrate, that the parents then take a conscience about it, that they granted this. 


1492 


have been ordered against God and by the devil; thus, they grieve to death, losing their authority and obedience that God has given them. 

Therefore, |, D. Martinus, command in the name of the Lord our God, that no one get engaged secretly, and then, when it has happened, ask the parents for permission, and thus seek a cover of shame and reason to gloss over his evil intentions with it 2c. And in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, condemn in the abyss of hell all those who adhere to them and help promote such devilish work (the secret betrothal), amen. 

Thus, not only the secret betrothal of the children is condemned, but also the parents’ consent, which is the first thing that follows. For it is not a good, free, fatherly will, but an imposed, unwilling will, for it comes from the devil's cunning, on which the secret betrothal is based, because it confirms that which was instituted by the devil and is against God; which no one can ever recognize as good and right, if one would only open one's eyes and follow God's word more than the devilish pope's statutes and tyranny. Hence it is that parents grieve to death over this without being deprived of their goods, and their consciences are confused. 

And since it may be thought that | am too hard and that | am too hasty, let it be remembered that | have a serious command from God, and that | cannot do otherwise than to preach the word of God and to punish and tear up the devil's statutes and lies. | should not approve of people pretending that it is a good, honest thing; yes, a damned thing that should not be protected, nor defended as right and seen through the fingers, as if it were not done wrong when children secretly get engaged and the parents have to agree to it. 

Who will blame me here for punishing? The burden is on me, | shall and must answer for it, as God says in the prophet Ezekiel, Cap. 3, 17. 18. and Cap. 33, 7. 8. says: "I have set you as a watchman" (to watch over things) "over my people, | command you; if you say anything out of my mouth, | will punish you.

hear that you are to warn them on my account. If therefore | say unto the wicked, Thou wicked must die; and thou tellest him not, that the wicked may be warned of his nature, the wicked shall die for his wickedness' sake, but his blood will | require at thine hand" 2c. Therefore, if | see that the devil entices me with secret betrothals and other misdeeds, sins and disgraces, and draws on my parents' consent, which is then forced and wrested, and is not a free good will, and | am to consent to it, and take it upon myself as if it were done right, | will leave it. | will pronounce my judgment against you, saying, "It is against God, whom you greatly anger by this, for he has earnestly commanded that children should not betroth themselves secretly, that is, steal, without the knowledge and will of their parents; for he says to Jeremiah in 29, v. 6: "Take wives for your sons, and give husbands to your daughters, as Samson did when he saw a mead in the land of the Philistines, he said to his parents, "Give her to me as a wife" 2c., Judg. 14, 2. 

This is necessary to say: Firstly, so that young people know that God has thus commanded, if they want to marry, that they should request and ask their parents for it, and not to get engaged, either against their will, or with their consent. On the other hand, | have to say it also for the sake of my conscience, to save and facilitate the same. Whoever does not want to follow God, let him always go, and he will know it. Since you do not want to hear it, nor suffer it, | will stand down every hour and hand over the preaching chair to you. But see how you will answer for it. God does not joke with him; know how to judge yourselves. 13) 


22 Another sharp admonition to the jurists. Dear people, you want to give me credit for my thoughts, since | will be a bit fierce

1494 


on the lawyers, because you shall hear reason enough, why it happens. We have now written many times, almost in all books, and we have painted it in such a way that it should be easy to grasp how the spiritual kingdom of this Lord Musk, 1) Jesus Christ, at Bethlehem is to be distinguished from the worldly kingdom, that it is almost too much and superfluous; yet the most learned, most understanding lawyers do not want to Know or understand it, but mix everything up, entangle it, mislead the consciences and lead them into uncertainty. 

That is why | have to wash their fur here (but we do not want to forget Mr. Moschel) and take the pope and his lawyers to school: because they are so coarse and incomprehensible that they do not know, we have to teach them. But we are not to learn from them. Even if they let themselves think that they know the art, they still lack it by a long way. For since they do not yet know how far the kingdom of the Lord Christ is distinguished from the kingdom of the world, they know nothing at all, and are gross idiots. 

But, dear people, do not accept my wrath, which | have against the lawyers. | will take up with them in the bite and in the right, and (if God wills) carry out with God's word. For if they will not do otherwise than they pretend, and also want to take hold of the Lord Christ's kingdom, then | will not, cannot and will not suffer it, even if a hundred thousand lawyers were melted into one heap: they shall leave this regiment to me contentedly, not mix themselves into Christ's kingdom, nor confuse and dispute the consciences, or | will give them a Latin that will be too difficult for them and will please them badly: in it they may then use all their art, understanding, wit and law, and yet everything shall be too short for them. 

And even if they say, "Oh, we won't do it," | know very well that they will do it, and they will force themselves to bring the pope and the bishop of Mainz back into the church with their shit and deceit, and to re-establish the devil's kingdom, which we have rejected with God's word. No, listen, | am not here for that,

that the lawyers should teach me what it means to govern and comfort the consciences. They are still too green for it, they know, with breeding, nothing about it, how one should keep house and lead the regiment in the church of God, so this Mr. Moschels realm is. | will not suffer it from them, so they may judge themselves by it and no other. They shall learn and suffer from me, otherwise they must not take it into their heads: if a hundred thousand lawyers were sitting on top of each other, and were as wise and learned as their Papinianus, even Solomon; for they take hold of our Lord Christ's spiritual government, and want to have their hands in all things, everything shall be done and directed according to their right and head: they want to do a shaky and tottering work and cause trouble in the consciences of men, whom we have hardly raised up and brought to certainty. 

No, dear fellow, it is not a matter of wavering among Christians, but of playing the game of conscience. And as St. Paul says in Eph. 4, 14: "That we be no more children, being swayed and weighed with all manner of wind and doctrine, by the craftiness of men, and deceitfulness, to deceive us." And again Col. 2:4, 8, 18: "But | say of this, that no man deceive you with reasoned words. See to it that no one deceives you through philosophy and loose seduction according to the statutes of men, and according to the statutes of the world, and not according to Christ. Let no one deprive you of your goal, who walks along in humility and the spirituality of angels of his own choice, having never seen any, and is puffed up without matter in his carnal mind" 2c. Like the pope's law and the highly learned jurists, who hang in the pope's butt like the great lumps 2c.

to publicly read the Jus Canonicum, the papal filth, to the youth, to praise it highly and to imagine it as if it were a delicious thing; which we, with great effort and work, have expelled from our church, rejected and condemned, and have proven with sufficient causes that it is not to be suffered nor tolerated in the church. But they want to bring such papal stinking filth back into our churches with pride and to our annoyance. 

But | want to admonish you very seriously: do not try me too hard; if you are too comfortable, | will drive away the tickle. If you cannot bear that | have made you beautiful and white, then | will make you black again, and the devil shall ravish you. | will tell you where your damask and velvet showers come from.

Therefore | advise: let the old dog sleep; but if you awaken him, you shall not easily bring him to rest again, and do not bachantesire and protect 1) yourself much. O! what are the theologians? say the lawyers, it is vain bachantesire and protectiveness. But | will make you bachantes and protectors again, and you shall stink. This | will have sworn to you. You shall not rule us theologians, nor reign over us. The rule and the regiment (in the church) is ours, even if you become mad and foolish all at once. If you do not want to grant it to us, then you must, and the devil shall not Know how to thank you for it. 


1) Bachant and Schitz are beginners, ABC students. 


And take the donkey farts out of the church, that's what | want to have; if not, you have to. There is nothing else in the whole papal, maligned, godless law (I should say: injustice) but donkey farts, in which one cannot learn even the smallest point or the smallest thing about faith, love, or sacrament. Protectiveness, yes, bullyism it is. And you want to prove your art in disgracing this whole church and throwing it to shame, to miss the poor youth with it, to disgrace yourselves, too, with great pleasure, and above all, to defy us with it. Yes, | will teach you well. 

Is the devil in you that you do not know what to do? | thought you had enough to learn and study about imperial law; you should not also neglect and prevent the innocent youth with the donkey's farts. Otherwise, Jus imperatorum, the imperial law, is studium infinitu, in which one has enough to study. You should thank God that you would be rid of donkey farts if you knew what you should do for pleasure. 

But | also think that the silver lawyers of the Thaler do such disgrace because of the holy church. Come on, | will atone for your lust, you are commanded to defy me. Do you dare to do this, because | am still alive, what will you do after my death? Well, | will have admonished you and also asked you to know it. If you are so comfortable with the donkey's feet, eat them elsewhere, and do not make a stink in our church.

The lawyers are very upset, complain vehemently, and are angry with me for preaching so harshly to them. Well, how shall | do to him?

And if | punish thee for thine iniquity and sin, wilt thou still be angry with me? If | do

This is also the case in the secular government. If a mayor or a judge punishes or does something good and necessary, they throw out the windows. Who wants to govern or preach in this way?

We seek nothing but the salvation and happiness of your souls; yet you have not so much brain in your heads as to think: Behold, the word is not his, but God's, the high Majesty in heaven, to whom we shall be obedient, and consider his Christian admonition and warning good, and so accept it as if God Himself spoke to you 2c. 

But if thou wilt not hear the word of God, and | must be silent; then shall the devil bring thee other preachers, whom thou must hear, than the Turk, Pabst 2c. The same ones the lawyers will gladly listen to. Now you have preachers who must answer for you. If you do not want to hear them, nor have patience with them, see where you will stay. We do not seek to be lords over you, as the pope does, but for the glory’ of God and your salvation, that you may 





a hard word), "that they may do it with gladness, and not with sighing, for that is not good for you." These are the words of the Holy Spirit: they must watch for you, and give an answer; and still have the heartache for it. 

Well, no one wants to have sinned and done wrong, from the highest to the lowest, yes, everyone still wants to defend evil. There will never be any repentance. But where there is no knowledge and confession of sin, there can be no forgiveness; therefore our preaching and admonishing is in vain. 

Now people complain about lords, noblemen, lawyers, burghers, peasants, etc., that they weigh people down hard, translate, flay and scrape, and do it as they want, beyond all measure: they drive their wickedness and drudgery longer and longer. Thus sins increase daily and get out of hand, in all classes by all means; and yet no one wants to have done wrong, nor to have sinned. One can no longer sin now. Despite who may tell me and blame me. They talk to me about my honor. Shoot, this one, 


1500 


that one! What does it matter to the priest? That this and that pass him by 2c. 

Now what shall | do with my exhortation to repentance, since no one does wrong? And when we punish, one as well as another, no one excepted, in all classes, they grumble and are angry, complain that we do them wrong. So now the jurists are complaining, they are very pleased and angry with me for punishing them and attacking them so harshly. But | must do it for the sake of my office and conscience, and if | did not, | would have to be condemned with them and put my soul in the stocks. | do not condemn pious lawyers; but | will faithfully advise you and tell you what you should do and how you should conduct yourself, and study blessedly with God, usefully and fruitfully in law, and become a right lawyer in whom God is pleased, and who can serve countries and people with a good conscience and glory. 


So do to him now: 


In the morning, when you have risen, take your Psalter or Biblia before you in the fear of God and humility, from His command, and read a psalm or a chapter, and consider it diligently. Then fall on your knees and say from your heart in the name of Christ: Almighty, eternal God, heavenly Father, you have decreed and commanded that | should study law, learn and speak what is right; therefore give me grace and blessing to seek and find the truth alone, and do only what is pleasing to you, for your honor and for the benefit of country and people, for the sake of Christ, your dear Son, my Lord and Savior 2c. 

That is what God likes. And if you pray in faith with all your heart, your prayer will surely be heard. Then go to and fall into the books, study diligently and confidently with joy, and He will give His blessing and prosperity to make you a fine useful man. For one. 

On the other hand: Beware of the pope, the anti- Christian. For even today one finds lawyers everywhere, even in our country, who consider his stench to be bismuth and sanctity. Then put the cross in front of you and 


Cap. 66. Of the jurists. § 24. 


1501 


Say: One should be obedient, not to the preceptoribus, in this case, but to Christ; he alone should be heard. As | have said concerning secret betrothals. These, together with other foolish and puppet works, tear out of your books, even your hearts, and speak what is right, not from papal, but according to imperial laws, which are according to natural law, and are not contrary to God's word. 

| am well pleased that you are and will be a lawyer; but beware of the devil, the pope and his decrees. And if they want to teach you what is contrary to God's word, put the cross in front of you and go away: for such teachers and doctors are not God's, but the servants of the wretched devil in hell who has possessed them. 

Therefore, be faithfully warned and admonished. | say again: we do not despise the jurists, but only punish the abuses and the pabst's blasphemy. Beware of this, as dear to you is your blessedness. Pray, be faithful and diligent in your office, help to end things, not to prolong them; as it commonly happens that they are postponed for many years, that both parties and attorneys fly out over them and die. For this reason, shorten the proceedings and settle them with two’, or at most, three sentences for judgment in good matters: for you shall not accept evil, much less serve in it, nor defend it, against your conscience. 

Yes, you might say, if | don't do it, someone else will, and he'll take the thalers in the meantime and run the show for him. Alas, it is all too true, and that is also what | am complaining about. But you, if you want to be a Christian otherwise, and not be condemned forever, do not indulge in such robbery and drudgery, by which the people are sucked dry and the advocates fattened. For it is a real drudgery; as a knacker once came to a silver lawyer, and said: Luck to you, God honor the craft. Then the doctor became unwilling. Yes, said the knacker, we are indeed of a craft, although we are in a degree more sorry, and not so great knackers, as you lawyers, although you do not want to have the name; for we knack dead animals, but you live people.

On March 25, a certain citizen of Wittenberg came |the words "this is my body" and cared nothing for their to ask Luther for advice in his case against Albrecht, Idigressions, and only held fast to the thing.

someone is right without being able to prove his right. You have both of these. The second obstacle is: a judge and executor. You lack this. Truth and right are well written in books, but they are nothing in practice. That is why D. Hieronymus Schurf said: The devil lead me, if it happens so, as it is written in books. Ah, truth, justice and righteousness is a hateful thing to the world, as Pilate answers Christ. No one suffers the right who otherwise dares to defend himself. The right is in the weapons, and it happens a metathesis, jus is vis.' For if they are powerful, they drag the matter out with long circumlocutions, and long damages follow. It is very dangerous with jurisprudence. Every man of goodwill should know the law, only to defend himself, that he may understand and hinder the wicked wiles of the world. Such a man is D. Brick. Other godless jurists, who seek only their own, have the right in arms. 

After that he said of the jurists at court. If they have good sense and are only mediocre in jurisprudence, they are gradually sharpened by examples so that they become excellent by practice, more than those who lecture, who are only concerned with theory. For the court has things from which wisdom comeswhich govern the world, and not books [govern the world]. Therefore, in all estates, things and practice make people more learned than knowledge. Reading the Bible would never have brought me to the knowledge, 


(Lauterbach, Jan. 16, 1538, p. 12.) 


Luther: When | saw the godless tyranny of the celibate life to some extent in the beginning of the Gospel, | did not trust myself, and approached D. Hieronymus Schurf that he would show me the cause of the celibacy from the Decretals, why such a great tyranny was imposed on the priests. (1 never thought of the monks, because they were under the vow, but only of the parish priests, who cannot maintain the household without marriage). But he could not raise anything for certain, but answered that the pope does not force anyone to the priesthood. And so he could not answer my question. 1) 


27 M. Luther does not want to suffer lawyers to teach him. 


When D. Martinus began to preach about baptism in 1532, he came to the jurists and judged them thus: | do not want to suffer that Duke George, because otherwise he cannot do anything with me, 3) brews in our lawyers, that they truss me, and dictate to me what | should preach. 


28. that it is dangerous to be a lawyer. (Lauterbach, May 12, 1538, p. 80.)

not allow anyone to study law. | will also forbid it to my sons 1). For true law has been abolished, just as theology under the papacy was only a name and a sham. God will preserve His kingdom against all deceivers of the devil through sincere church servants. For the Gospel is in danger from sectarians and rebellious peasants and belly servants, as once the Roman Empire was in Rome. 


Lawyers and regents must believe the testimony, and speak and judge according to it. 


D. M. Luther was asked: "Did David do right, 2 Sam. 1, 15, to kill the one who said he would have stabbed King Saul, and yet he did not do it? Then he answered and said, Yea, he hath done right. So a judge does right when he pronounces an unjust verdict on the basis of the testimony of witnesses, who must be believed in what they testify and be satisfied with it if the judge does not know otherwise. The jurists must also do this and believe the witnesses; if they find out 2) afterwards that what they have testified is not true. For truth is in the mouths of two or three. Deut. 19, 15. Thus they have a rule: A judge should speak according to what has been presented and proven, secundum allegata et probata. 


30. jurisprudence has no certain proof. 


Demonstratio remains in specie specialissima: certain proof cannot be missing at all, stands only in that, which has no excerpt at all, and on nothing else can be interpreted and directed. But now a jurist deals with the particularibus, which are common and can have various extracts, therefore he can have no demonstration and real certainty. But a theologian does not err, in that he has God's word, pure and unadulterated; but a jurist cannot. 


1) Cf. § 39 and 46 of this Cap. 2) So Stangwald. Aurifaber is missing the word "gleich". 3) d. i. no exception. 


Cap. 66. Of the jurists. § 28-31. 


1505 


He must be sure that he can say it all with a single nail, and that he can always hit the right target. As in this case, when one has killed himself, there can be no certain demonstration and proof, for it is far-reaching, like all morality, to concern outward good breeding. It is evident from the deed that he has hanged himself; but if the devil should come and conduct this affair, all princes and lawyers would be too weak to do so. For he could say that he had struck him on the neck, pushed him himself, put the knife in his own fist, and put the rope around his neck, as the devil often does and is wont to do. 

Although it is true that he who kills himself does wrong, it is not strictly and certainly true that he has killed himself; therefore there is no demonstration that it is not certain and otherwise; and yet God allows such a murderer who has killed himself to be judged and condemned by the authorities. Therefore moralis Philosophia, the art that deals with external discipline, has no demonstration and certainty. But Scientiae Mathematicae and natural philosophy have demonstrations and certain rules that are not lacking; for in these there is no change, but it always remains certain: as, one always remains one, two two, three times three nine 2c.; the whole is greater than any piece of it 2c. But in moral philosophy, which stands in outward good customs and discipline, there the materia, that, with which it deals, is changed according to the circumstances. But a judge or jurist is excused if he does what concerns his office, and acts according to the laws described with diligence, and discusses as much as he can, in the fear of God: even if he does not hit it all at once, the same belongs to the Lord's Prayer: Forgive us our trespasses. 


31. of thorough proofs. 


Evidence is of three kinds: one is quite certain, which cannot be lacking; the other is proven, that it is commonly so; the third is sophistical or evil. In the proven one belongs what in medicine and jurisprudence comes from art, from certain causes and rules. 


1506 


For 1) a jurist can say: This one has killed himself or another, therefore he is a murderer or death-beater; but it is no demonstrative nor even certain proof, which cannot be missing; because one can say: | do not know how it happened to me; because many innumerable cases are, which can_ happen approximately, thoughtlessly and against one's will. 1) 

That is why they themselves say: in moral material, as far as external good breeding and discipline are concerned, the means of virtue should be well judged, considered, and held according to the certain purpose, so that it is hit when it is possible. But this is often lacking. But it is not so in the Scriptures, which have their certain rules and proofs that cannot fail nor be false, as when they say, "He that believeth shall be saved," Marc. 16:16. Although it cannot be known who believes, yet this is certain: He that believeth on Christ meets the right end. Circumstances do not change anything here, so whoever, if, as, where 2c. he wills, believes, he will be saved; for one cannot fail in Christ, having been presented in the Word and having believed in Him. He that lacketh, hath lacked altogether. 

But in the right there is no case nor action that could not become uncertain in a case. For the same things that occur and happen beside or at the same time are innumerable, which make the substance and essence of it wrong and unjust. Thus adultery is sometimes not adultery; as if one slept ignorantly with his own wife, and thought no otherwise than that he slept with another. That is why it is said in schools: accidentia possunt adesse, vel non; accidental things can be there or not there. So it can sometimes happen that patricide is not always a sin, as if the son unknowingly and against his will, approximately, hit his father, and he died of it 2c. 

Therefore, no certain rule can be given that cannot be missing at all, one must include in so many excerpts 3) to oerterns 4) whether one cannot always be sure of it. 


1) Here with Stangwald "like" is omitted. 2) So Stangwald instead of Muthwillen. 3) d. i. Exceptions. 

4) So Stangwald instead of: "zum 6rtern". 


Cap. 66. Of the jurists. § 31. 32. 


1507 


Nevertheless, one must not leave it standing and do nothing about it; but do as much as one can in the fear of God, from His command, and let Him rule, and say: Dear God, You have placed me in this state and commanded me to do this: | do this as much as | can with Your help, give blessing and prosperity to it; if | do too much or too little, forgive me for the sake of Your dear Son. But in theologia there is no exceptio nor excerpt, there one must be absolutely sure that it is thus and not otherwise. For a theologian and preacher must not say: Lord, if | have taught wrongly, forgive me; but what he teaches and writes publicly, of this he must be certain, and say: God has spoken, taught, written, and is his word, therefore it is certain truth. 


32. Comparison of jurisprudence and medicine against theology. 


Above | have said much about demonstrationibus and certain proofs, which are not lacking, but always certainly true; which has this opinion and understanding, that in rights no case can be given and indicated, which one could prove certainly, so that not at all lacked; because the quarrel is always in Minori and above the other proposition of the final speech. 

But | like to talk about this trade, because it distinguishes the professions and ranks among the scholars in a fine way; namely, that the right are Moralia, deal with the things that concern external and good discipline. Therefore the emperor is a moralis philosophus, disciplinarian and teacher. But medicine is natural philosophy, an art that deals with natural things and has to do with them. Nature cannot come higher than to preserve the body and the mind, than to preserve health and good morals. A physician prepares the instrument, that is, the body, which a lawyer should use properly. After these comes theology, and says: We must also have something after this temporal life, namely, eternal life, which is given to us by grace, without our merit, free of charge, for Christ's sake through faith. 


1508 


Aristotle is the best teacher of one in Philosophia morali, how one should lead a finely chaste external life; in naturali Philosophia he is no good. For when he disputes natural things, he says in general whether a thing moves or not. The same, however, is the same as if a physician said, "Your body has its movement from health to disease: whoever becomes ill has been healthy before; but he should call the disease by its proper name, expressly, specifically, and indicate what it is called. 

But theologia has its special, explicit, certain demonstrations, reasons and rules; as Luc. 10, 16: "He who hears you", says Christ, "hears me" 2c. You hear me in him who is God's servant and teaches His word, therefore you certainly hear God Himself. Item: Whoever is baptized is baptized by God and becomes blessed. You are baptized; therefore you are baptized by God and will be saved. This we must know, that whoever is baptized will be blessed. And even though we cannot really and certainly know who believes, it is certain with God that whoever believes will be saved. Neither the jurists nor the Medici have such special, certain demonstrations and rules; they have common rules, but they do not teach anything certain. 


33. what is praiseworthy in rights. (Cordatus No. 395. 431. 432.) 


| like that the rights are always more favorable to the defendant than to the plaintiff. For if the accused has no advocate, the court day can be postponed, which is not allowed to the plaintiff. Thus it is better for a tyrant to be in fear than for those who are plagued by him. 

GOD will receive His word from earth in the pen. 

The theologians are the keel on the feathers, the lawyers the stocking. 1) But if they do not want to keep the keel on the feather, they ruin the theologians and themselves.

34. spiritual law. (Contained in Cap. 32, § 5.) 


35. the jurist's art. 


What great and delicious things can lawyers do, even if they boast highly and want to master and rule everything, even that does not belong to their art? For if they can do many things, they can build and erect a kitchen and a dishing house. If it tastes good in the kitchen, it tastes all the worse in the dishonest place of the house, said D. Martinus, thus touching the lawyers’ belly. 


36. of the jurists’ piety. 


When D. Weiler and D. M. Luther were discussing with each other about the piety of theologians and lawyers, D. M. Luther said: Being pious actually belongs to the theologians, not to the lawyers, as the world is now; although they should also be pious before others. And he went on: M. Georg Rérer and Amsdorf are pious theologians, but only one jurist is pious and wise, D. Gregorius Brick. 


37. the theology preference. 


The jurists must let the theologians sit at the top, or must go down to the lowest, they may be guided by this; otherwise nothing will come of it. However, for the sake of avoiding greater 2) evil, one should tolerate a few. This we will gladly do with the lawyers and be content; only that they do not grasp so hard at our Lord God's beard, that he cannot suffer: so we, who are his servants, shall not suffer it either. So we come to blows with one another and scuffle. But God helps the weakest here and saves his honor. Even if some of us succumb to it and fall to the ground, there is nothing to it; God will and must finally prevail and keep the field. This and no other. 

The jurists are (de facto) against GOD by deed, not (de jure) by right. For since GOD is a Lord and Founder of all good and honest rights, as Solomon says in his 


2) So Stangwald. Aurifaber: "great". 


1510 


As Proverbs says in chapter 8, they should fear him and judge themselves and their rights according to his word and will; they should not use and interpret against him according to their own head and pleasure, to his shame and to the harm of other people. As, unfortunately, is seen and experienced all too often. Therefore, it is very dangerous to be a lawyer now; although the art, as a gift of God, is right and good, but the abuse is wrong and criminal. 


38. disagreement of jurists and theologians. 


There is an eternal quarrel and struggle between lawyers and theologians. Just as law and grace are not compatible with each other, for they are opposed to each other; so lawyers and theologians are also at odds, for one always wants to be higher than the other. This is the reason that the jurists want their thing to be considered the highest. They have now ruled for four hundred years, and have always despised the theologians, and have been disgusted with them. When | studied at Erfurt, the lawyers were allowed to offer theologia to the doctoribus: Don't the donkeys know how to walk? They were called donkeys, and yet they were cathedral provost, decanus and in the regiment. Now, because their rule is taken away from them and their things are overturned, their books are rejected and they are expelled from the church, and they do not want to let them rule the church and appoint parishes, they are lazy. Therefore the theologians and jurists will never be one: they want to be in the church and govern the conscientias with it; we do not want to suffer that. We have read their books: they do not let go of their negation. 

Therefore it is a special grace, if a lawyer is tobe a good Christian, there must be the Holy Spirit. For, as Doctor Henning said, if you give in to one thing, they always want to have everything. If our gospel is right, as there is no doubt about it, then the Pabst's fair cannot be right. We have finely distinguished how far the lawyers should go with their regiment; but they do not want to do it, they want to rule over everything alone. The regiment is the primogeniture of Esau and Jacob; Esau wants to rule, and Jacob owns the regiment. 


Cap. 66. Of the jurists. 


§ 37-39. 1511 

At another time D. M. Luther: Our jurists pronounce a verdict for me in the Consistorio, quod pertinet ad conscientiam regendam: that belongs here in the church for me D. Martinum and other theologians. Extra conscientiam they shall speak, not intra conscientiam; they shall have jura corporum et famae, there we theologians ask nothing. But that they want to fall into the spiritualia and rule the conscientias, that we cannot stand. 

Item, he said: We have to tear up the Consistory, because we do not want to have the lawyers and the Pope inside. The lawyers do not belong in Ecclesiam with their processes, otherwise they will bring the Pope in again. 


39 Theologians praise jurisprudence highly. 


Take all the lawyers in the whole world and see if one of them has praised theology and holy scripture as | have praised their profession and art. Dear sirs, we theologians praise and extol you highly; but you do not do so again. All lawyers do not esteem God's word as great and high as we esteem them. Only D. Gregorius Brick gives to God what is God's, and to the emperor what is the emperor's; but the others do not give it to God, but to themselves. He runs daily in the Bible, because he wants to be sure of the teaching. How then, truly, it is highly necessary for everyone who wants to be a Christian and to be saved. 

Summa Summarum: Our life is called Remissio peccatorum, forgiveness of sin, otherwise it does not want to keep the stitch 1). Theologia deals with God, it cannot court God as much as a jurist can do with the temporal and with the thalers. That is why lawyers have greater speculation and thought, said D. Martinus. 

Then he took his little son in his hands and said, "If you were to become a lawyer, | would not be satisfied with you. He must become a preacher, he must baptize, preach, administer the sacrament, go to the sick, and comfort them and other afflicted.

41. difference among lawyers. (Lauterbach, Nov. 20, 1538, p. 176.) 


After that he said to Doctor Heinrich Schneidewein that he was suitable for his law faculty by his dispositions and nature, and he made classes of lawyers. Some are by nature, like D. Brick, who would be very excellent by nature, effective and powerful in practice. Some are artificial [jurists], who are capable of much in advice, like D. Hieronymus Schurs, but in practice he soon lacked. Some are quite righteous, like D. Sebaldus (Munster) [in Nuremberg]. Some are quite devilish, like Turck, Breitenbach 2c. 


42. difference of the right. (Lauterbach, July 7, 1538, p. 97.) [MISSING TEXT] 


Natural law is the practical basis that has to do with morality, forbids evil and commands good. The given [positivum] right is a judgment, has an epitome of probable reasons and agrees with the natural right. The cause of this [natural right] is God, who created this light. But the cause of this is the authority, as theft has the punishment of hanging according to the given right for the sake of acceptable causes; not like the 


good that the common and imperial law remained throughout the empire. But it is too deeply torn, anda change could not be made without great confusion. Thus the law of the Saxons is inequitable against women. If a man, at his death, leaves behind a wife who has lived with him faithfully for many years, she is forced to go out like a maid, because the law says that only a chair and a distaff are to be given to the widowed woman who is left behind. This is interpreted by the lawyers according to the grammar: A chair and skirt. Thus a pious woman would be worse off than a maid. But | understand chair and skirt allegorically: a house and livelihood, as also the lawyers interpret this allegorically: The four stakes for the whole house. 

After that it was said that Doctor Fachs had tried to bring the Saxon law into an order and method. Luther said: He will work in vain, as if | wanted to conjugate the verbum sum regularly: sum, sus, sut. 


44, the jurists justice. 


The righteousness of lawyers is a worldly, external righteousness; but ours, of theologians, is in praedicamento relationis, 1) a foreign righteousness, namely of the Lord Christ, which God gives us out of pure grace, without all our merit and good works, to those who grasp it by the word with faith. 


45 Few lawyers, many procuratores. 


D. M. Luther said: "There are few lawyers, but

The world is governed by opinions. we tell the truth to the world. If the lawyers also tell the 

truth to the nobility, you will have it as good as we do. They despise us both, if they have to know the truth about us. In sum, they say, we theologians can do nothing’ and the jurists can do nothing either. Caesar Pflug once said: They must be loose people who handle the Scriptures and have nothing else to do. Finally he died sine lux et crux. That was his business. 


The jurists rule the world only with opinions and Opinions, not with the law; that is why many things are often postponed and conducted until the tenth year or longer. If one governed with laws, then it would go through soon and quickly.

which the law does not mainly speak. It abates them; but this abatement must be of such a kind that it is not an annihilation. For against the natural law and the divine law no abrogation is to be permitted, and necessary moral duties are to be preferred to ceremonies, except in the case of confession.

54 The jurists have only the peoples right. 


The jurists do not actually describe and define natural law as being common to both humans and unreasonable animals 2c. For a man, as a master, even according to the law of nature, must be distinguished from other animals and beasts, and something better and more excellent must be assigned and given to him before other animals; therefore it would be better and rightly spoken if they said: Natural law is partly animal. On the other hand, it is not so in unreasonable animals, for these have no right, but only in man; therefore it is not really called by them natural right. For right is actually that which should and must be done. So five and three are not eight, but are of themselves, by nature. 

So it is not really said that the law of nature or natural law is in an animal, in that it protects and shields itself from unjust force; for the protection happens from itself and is natural. Therefore, in a beast and unreasonable animal is the deed and the work, not the right, which is only in a man. Thus begetting, bearing, nourishing and protecting children are only deeds and works, not rights. After all rights must be the debit, the must. For one may not say to a sow that she should eat. Therefore the jurists do not actually have natural law, but only the law of nations, which flows from human reason. Right is not a thing, as an animal, so begotten, as a

Tree that brings forth fruit, though nothing is preached of it, saying: but the law is in theology; which is not begotten, but shall come to pass and be done, or does not rhyme: moreover, since natural law is appropriated and given to man, as the lawyers set and describe it, all things are admitted. 


55. lawyer stand is now a dangerous stand. (This § is contained in § 28 of this chapter). 


56. lawyers should advise. (Cordatus No. 1040.) 

Jurists are not to be tongues waggers and chatterers, but legal scholars and people who give an account of what is right or wrong. But if this is despised in them, they are forced to conduct lawsuits. In Italy, however, they are held in high esteem, for there they have three hundred florins, while in Germany a legal expert is hardly paid a hundred. Also the pastors should be provided with ample living; but since this is not done, they are forced to cultivate the land, to be stewards 2c. 


The first two words are: "The first two words are the first two words. 


Doctor M. Luther said: Studium Juris, to study law, would be a sordidum, impolite, and nasty thing, since one would only seek enjoyment, money, and property in order to become rich. Then Peter Weller, who was with him in the house and went to the table, said: He would not have the sense and would not do it. Then M. Luther cried out loudly and said to his family, "Wolf, go and ring the great bell and bring water to cool him down. But when he insisted on it and said yes, the doctor asked him whether he was studying in law only for the sake of knowing what is right or for the sake of pleasure. Then he would be nonsensical; but the final cause, why you become lawyers and study law, is the money, that you may become rich. 


1520 


58. a respectable council at a court. 


Nothing, said D. M. Luther, is more harmful than a respectable council. If one hears his advice and concerns, it has hands and feet; but if it is to be started and put into action, it stands like a stubborn horse that cannot be moved. 


59. lawyers do not know what the church is. 


The lawyers do not know what ecclesia (the church) is. If they searched all their books, they would not find what Ecclesia, the Church, is; therefore they should not reform us here. Omnis Jurista est aut ne- quista, aut ignorista: Every jurist is either a mischievous one, or an ass that knows nothing in divine matters. And if a lawyer wants to talk about it, say to him: "Do you hear, fellow, a lawyer should not talk here before a sow: so he should say: "Thank you, dear grandmother, | have not heard a sermon for a long time. They shall not teach us what ecclesia (church) means. There is an old saying: A lawyer is a bad Christian. That is true. 


6V. That the Epiikia must rule in all matters. 


The 15th of February Anno 1546 D. Martinus said at Eisleben: That Aristotle had written no better book than Quintum Ethicorum, and he put a beautiful definition, quod justitia sit virtus consistens in mediocritate, prout sapiens eam determinat; there he threw in émeiyeiav; and said further: Legislator rudi materia rem determinat, et si omnes casus praevidisset, tum eos signasset: ergo prout sapiens determinat, etc. This is very nicely spoken. The jurists now want straight, quod justitia sit virtus, consistens tantum in mediocritate. Do not want to allow that, prout sapiens determinat. But what is bonus magistratus, vel bonus princeps? Respondeo: est viva lex. If he wants to be mortua lex, and do only according to what is written on the parchment, it often turns out badly. Therefore, one must have émieiysiav. 

But Doctor Levin von Enden of Magdeburg said to D. Luther: That Baldus wrote: 


Cap. 66. of the jurists. § 58-62. 


1521 


Illum bestiam esse, qui pateretur se fieri arbitrum, quia onus illud in se transferri patitur, quod alioqui multis prudentibus relinqueretur deliberandum. Then O. Martinus said on it: Melius est, unam esse bestiam, quam ut multi homines sint bestiae. And what are 1) also jurists, so evil, 1) different, because 1)68tiL6? 

Then D. Jonas said: "Doctor, now we are accused of this: Since the laity have the power to judge Christian doctrine, they also want to settle and reconcile worldly disputes, and then involve princes and lords in such disputes that nothing good comes of it. Each one wants to be the Vir sapiens. Then the doctor answered: "One should see to it, ut habeant virum vere prudentem; émeiyeia must remain. 

Mantuanus vocat jurisconsultos legum tyrannos, cum dicit: Legumque Tyranni rabulae forenses. 


61. a whimsical case. (Cordatus No. 602.) 


Cases that happen by chance make a mockery of the highest law of jurists, and it is because the strongest law must not be exercised, but equity. Example: A donkey, which is pulled into a ship and tied to it, moves the empty ship elsewhere, while the skipper is absent so long that the loosened ship and the donkey are wrecked. Here it asks itself now, which of both can be forced to the payment. So also the theologians must preach, keeping the greatest equity, that the people do not become too holy or too evil. 


62. aequitas habenda, non summum jus. (Cordatus No. 452 and 857.) 


Those who love equity need not resort to the strictest right, for it must be forgiveness of sins. Before quarreling, one should cut off half the neck of the strictest right, and then equity could find a place. 

The strongest medicine is the greatest weakness, the sharpest right is the greatest wrong, the greatest theologian is the greatest sinner.

1. where to get preachers and pastors. 


Schools must be given by pastors and preachers, as is also done in the papacy; but what has come to cathedrals and vicarages has become rotten and done no good. 

At another time, Luther said: "From schools one must take pastors and preachers, who must build and maintain churches. Schools and parishes are better than the concilia; that is why | have preferred them to the conciliis in my booklet, which will annoy the papists. 

In 1539, on January 28, Luther said how now the youth had such a good time and comfort to study, because all arts were taught in a fine, orderly and correct way, so that one could easily grasp who was not a fool. In this way, the boys would not be held so harshly. In former times, the youth was pulled too hard, so that they were called martyrs in school: especially they were plagued with the Lupo and Casualibus and Temporalibus, which was no use at all, very annoying and burdensome, also unfunny, so that one only spent the good time and spoiled many a fine, skilful head; but it did not last beyond six years. Now, at this time, when God has again given good arts, and those who can teach them finely correctly, the youth does not want to study, is lazy, careless and disgruntled. And read the young Hans von A. a good

For | do not want to know or suffer such examples of disobedience in my house and over my table," he said, "even if you had earls' estates: you judge yourself by them, | do not want you to suffer them. 


2. which houses are the most comfortable. 


D. M. Luther praised the houses in cities above others, and said that those were the best for married couples, which had two rooms high and well situated to the churches and the market. 


(The following Cordatus No. 1110. 1111.) 

| hope that the universities of Erfurt and Leipzig will flourish again, since they agree with our theology. But some must lay down their heads first. 

Theology maintains the universities, lawyers do not. It is allhie no more than a Schindleich. Erfurt is in the best position where a city must stand, even if it should be destroyed. It is now no more than a stable full of pigs. Where evil food is, there are funny people, because they have to search. Where fat fields are, there they do not build the houses, but fatten the bellies. Bavaria and Switzerland are barren, but well cultivated.

3. from the University of Erfurt. (Cordatus No. 1004.) 


The University of Erfurt was once so large that all the others were hardly Particularschulen. | do not believe that there has been a larger secular school in the world than [the number of those] who wanted to be graduated [there] as Magisters. 1) 


4. useful, so comes out of schools. (The beginning of this § in Lauterbach, Oct. 1, 1538, p. 139 f.). What then follows until the end, 12 Dec. 1538, p. 189.) 

On October 1, he praised the usefulness of the schools, which, although they had little prestige, nevertheless created great benefit, which was simply the preservation of the church. For there the youth is educated to godliness and sent to all ranks. From them, collaborators and school teachers are chosen to be servants of the church. Woe to Germany, because it neglects the schools so much! Woe to the bishop of Mainz, who destroys the universities in Erfurt and Mainz, which he could preserve with one word! Only this corner in Wittenberg flourishes in studies. The papists -will probably build the stable in time, when the wolf has eaten the cattle. The bishop of Mainz is guilty of this sin; indeed, he is the ruin of the schools and of all Germany. He deserves the punishment for it, because he has a pale color in his face, earth-colored, deadly, as if clay is stained with blood. As he is by nature and character, so he has his color. He has certainly incited Lemnius against D. Brick, that he should call him the most excellent rabulist [chatterer]. He does not care much about my person, because he is dead in the first table [of the holy ten commandments, but he fears the bridge in the second table. Therefore Lemnius is instigated to attack him. For it is probable that his courtiers and lawyers are the most spiteful enemies of Brick, who want to retaliate against him with this attack. | want to tease D. Briick with this "Rabulist". 

On December 12, there was a lot of talk about universities and their ceremonies; the be-

The most famous, and which would have the largest number of students, would be the one in Paris, where the theologians would have your own and very pleasant place in the city, called the Sorbonne. | believe it is so called from the sorbis, the apples near the dead sea, which outwardly have a very beautiful appearance, but inwardly they are ashes. Thus the University of Paris is very frequented, which is the mother of many errors; for it holds quite boorish disputations; they shout among themselves, as ina tavern, Latin, French, Italian, and finally they enforce silence by clapping hands. But they do not award a doctorate in theology to anyone who has not proven himself for ten years, admittedly, in their futile sophistry. In Bourges, too, they adorn the graduated doctors and give them fish traps to catch people with. 


5. quite a few universities and schools in Germany Christian. (This § is transferred to Cap. 4, § 71, where it belongs). 


6. from the deposition. 


And when D. Martinus was at a deposition together with some excellent scholars, he graduated three boys and said: "This ceremony is used so that you may be humbled, not be hopeful and presumptuous, nor become accustomed to evil. For such vices are strange monstrous beasts, which have horns not befitting a student, and are evil. Therefore humble yourselves and learn to suffer and have patience, for you will be deposited all your lives. In great offices, the burghers, peasants, the nobility, and your wives will one day depose you and plague you. If such things happen to you, do not become fainthearted, despondent and impatient, for they will not overcome you; but be confident, and suffer such crosses with patience, without murmuring: remember that you are consecrated to suffer at Wittenberg, and you can say when it comes: "Well, | have first begun to be deposited at Wittenberg, that must be done.

last my whole life long. So this deposition of ours is only a figure and image of human life, in all kinds of misfortunes, plagues and chastisements. Poured wine on their heads and absolved them from bean and bachanten. 


7. the deposition, to which it is close. 


When at a different time M. Antonii Lauter 

bach's famulus, B. Tham, was deposited, and 

D. M. Luther graduated him from the Bachanterei, he admonished him to the fear of God, to the right knowledge of God, to good morals and respectability, to patience and suffering, and to diligent study, and said: He should know that his study and this student status would be subject to many misfortunes, displeasure and resistance and would have all kinds of offence. It starts with deposition and conspiracy, and it remains until the pit, therefore he should be patient. For deposition is nothing other than a work of the law, which teaches us that we should know ourselves, who and how we are, and humble ourselves, both before God and men, as befits each in his station: that one not become arrogant and proud, as the young students, baccalaureates, magistri and doctores do in their gifts, which God gives them out of pure grace. Therefore, God also sends them many depositions, so that they may be well deposited and humbled. And depositions are an old custom and habit in universities and high schools. 


8. from the University of Wittenberg. 


Oh, how bitterly hostile is the devil to our church and school, which he attacks before others and storms into it. This church was called the dear bread, bread roll, therefore it is contested everywhere from within and without: Tyranny and sectarianism prevail with all violence, since all the members of the body in the church are against one another; even we, who are of one heart, plague one another. | think that there are many bad boys and lurkers here who listen to us, and are glad when trouble and disunity arise, therefore one should 


Cap. 67. Of schools, universities and good arts. § 6-8. 


1527 


Pray and watch diligently; if God does not preserve us, we are finished. It can be said thus. Pray, pray. This school is like a foundation and the bedrock of pure religion; therefore it is maintained with lectionary and remuneration, against Satan's raging and fury. 

In 1539 an Italian from Sems ate with D. M. Luther, talked a lot with him, and stayed there for several weeks, perhaps to find out how things were here. M. Luther said: "We like to have them, because we act publicly and do not shy away from the light: perhaps he is dispatched here by devout God-fearing people, so that he could inquire and see whether such shameful things are happening and being committed here, as they say and tell us. 

| have told D. Pommer before: That whoever will despise the authority of this school after my death, since it remains otherwise only as it is now, both school and church, the same is a heretic and a perverse man. For God first revealed and purified His Word in this school, and now this school and city, both in doctrine and life, may be compared with all others; although we are not perfect, but still frail in life. Those who are now the highest and most distinguished theologians and scholars, they hold with us, as Amsdorf, Brentius, Rhegius, desire our friendship, write to us; and all those who flee us, secretly poke at us and speak ill of us, they have left the faith and fallen away, as Jeckel and Grickel, they alone can do it, and have learned nothing from us. As Zwingel also boasts. Who could do something five and twenty years ago? Who stood by me one and twenty years ago, when God led me into the game against my knowledge and will? But Ladiinklein has the misfortune. 

D. M. Luther said that the universities were not old in Germania. Fulda and some rich monasteries would have been universities at first, and they would have read, preached and worked so that the youth would be taught about God and good arts, otherwise no one would have taken care of the youth. But after the founders and monasteries had become rich, they would have put off the work, and the studia would have been corrupted.

1529 





At the same time nothing was valid, because Papa, and the poor Ecclesiae gemebant, clamabant, suspirabant, they have opened the heavens to our Lord God; as God says in the Psalm: Propter miseriam inopum et gemitum pauperum nunc exsurgam, Ps. 12, 6. 12, 6. Gemitus pauperum, the groaning of the poor, is a great thing in the sight of our Lord God, for when the Gemitus goes, the devil and the world beware. The pope remembers: "Wait, they must cry out and groan; as the world now also presses us hard and everything is flooded with sins. The cries and groans are going on now, and they will become even greater. The nobles and merchants 1) are now exhausting land and people with usury, so that many people will have to die of hunger because of poverty, so that one will not be able to come ad conjugium, as the voces are always ready to go: | would gladly take a wife, if | knew how | should feed her; will thus become a forced celibate. That is not good. In this way the nobility will also come and take over the parishes. Ita conticescet vox Evangelii, then the last day will come in threes. We have left them the large monasteries and church estates, so that they should provide us with the parishes alone; but they do not do it. My most gracious Lord is still doing something; praise be to God! 

| often reckon him, and come closer and closer to forty years; 2) then | think it should have an end. For St. Paul did not preach longer than forty years; item, the prophet Jeremiah also did not preach longer than forty years; the same also St. Augustine. And when the forty years had often passed, during which the divine word was preached purely, it ceased, and a great calamity came upon it. 

Tempora Arii have been quite miserable, miserable times, there have been no more than two righteous pious bishops. Who presided over them? Our Lord God. 





1) Usurers. 2) This is not to be understood of years of life, but, as is immediately apparent from what follows, of years of action. 


9. of degrees and doctorates in universities, and of good arts. 3) 


D. Carlstadt Bodenstein publicly condemned the degrees and doctorates, when one makes Magistros and Doctores in universities. And since he himself was present, he said: "I know that | do wrong, that | promote these two to doctors, only for the sake of two florins; but | promise and swear that | will henceforth no longer promote anyone. And he did this publicly in the castle church in Wittenberg, where it was customary to make doctores. For this reason, | and other good people punished him severely. And [he] wrote to the cathedra and chair, where the doctores theologia are used to stand: You shall not let yourselves be called masters; and spouted such blasphemous words that it is not to be said, and yet even for the sake of two florins he took his doctorate, saying: This little profit and little enjoyment | accept in the meantime. 

But all his blasphemous words he wanted to gloss over with the saying Matth. 23, 8. where Christ says: "You shall not be called Rabbi", that is, Magister. And he made himself so useless with evil blasphemous words that all those who sat by and listened to it were grieved, and became unhappy about it; they were angry, and could hardly refrain from paying him again with such words. But I, finding it written on the catheter and chair, wrote under it: This saying is not to be understood thus: You shall not let yourselves be called masters; but thus: You shall not devise new doctrine, nor bring forth anything new; let it remain with that which | have taught, and commanded you that you should teach and show it to others. 

In 1538, the day after the holy day of Christ, Luther admonished the people of the church that they should keep the ceremonies held and used in universities and schools honestly, for the honor and glory of God, and for the benefit of religion and the government; so that the youth might know and see how and for what purpose good arts are useful and

and said, as one compared an unlearned man to a dead man, but a learned man to a living man. Experience shows that all those who have not studied complain and are sorry that they despised good arts and did not learn them in their youth, even though they would have learned to read and write least of all. Knowledge of languages, especially Latin, is useful to all, even to soldiers and merchants, so that they can converse with foreign nations and deal with them without interpreters, and not only remain German brothers. You parents (he continued) can leave your children no better nor more certain treasure than that you let them study and learn good arts: house and farm burn and go, but art is good to bear and remains. When we are far from each other in body, yet we can be present by letters and writing, and one can speak to another and show his heart: | can speak here to one in Rome by letters. 

He, M. Luther, also spoke fiercely against those who could not do anything themselves and were hostile to good arts and scholars. He told a story about how a miser and an unlearned man should have advised and said in the council: One should spare the money, and not keep a town clerk; but one should trade with notched woods over land. Such clumsy ruffians and asses would not like to see the right pure religion and secular government advised, but would much rather see them perish. Now we would like to advise Germany, so good arts despised; well, she will probably realize it in time. But | am glad that a school is being established here, and it is my greatest concern and care that it be preserved, for the church is seeded and planted with such grafts and trees. 


10. God sustains good arts and schools. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1317.) 

God sustains the arts, not the people, but for each of them he assigns some gifted people [ingenia]; and this is a delicious art, which is considered worthless in the world’. 


D. M. Luther marveled that there were so many useful arts, and said: "If our Lord God has so highly adorned this miserable life with such lovely gifts, what will be in that life? Therefore, a special patron and patron saint was given and assigned to each art, who presided over it; as, the patron saint of the artists was St. Catherine, St. Augustine of the theologians. In the beginning, St. Paul was the patron of the University of Wittenberg, after which it was changed in seals; St. Paul still reigns in our university. 


11. now is better to study, neither before times. (Cordatus No. 832.) 


All the arts are now very splendid and all the languages, which were formerly buried in such great barbarism that even the greatest doctor could not have delivered A Latin speech, but the barbarians 1) spoke barbarously and formed barbarous words. 


12. from the dialectica. (Cordatus No. 1577.) 


If | had to write dialectical things, | would banish all such words as syllogism, enthymema, 2) proposition, exemplum, because they are foreign and Greek, and are not understood. Proposition, that is status, the thing; syllogism is a taking off, as one speaks: You can well take that off with you, not an entangled speech, as some are wise [i.e. nose-wise]. 


13. what dialectica is. (Cordatus No. 1578.) 


The dialectic speaks simply, as if | said: Give me to drink. The rhetoric decorates: Give me the sweet juice in the cellar, which stands fine in the jar, makes the 


people happy. 


1) A barbarian was the name given by the Greeks and Romans to one who did not know their language. 

2) ev&vunua a kind of hidden inference in logic, in which one of the two premises is concealed., (Wrampelmeyer.) 


1532 Cap. 67. Of schools, universities and good arts. § 14. 15. 1533 


14. question from the dialectica. (Cordatus No. 776.) 


Dialectic is when one says a thing differently and clearly with short words, but rhetoric deals with coaxing and dissuading. This has its commonplaces: the good, the honorable, the useful, the easy. Paul summarized this in the shortest possible way when he said: "If anyone teaches, let him wait for teaching; if anyone exhorts, let him wait for exhortation. As if | wanted to instruct a farmer, according to dialectic | would describe his life, his labors, his house, his fruits, and everything that constitutes the content of his life. 


For dialectics finely shows the way how one should speak of things properly and correctly, where one should take it from and what is right or wrong, actually and certainly recognize, and judge or judge. As if one wanted to defend this proposition: Faith alone makes one righteous, pious and blessed. Here | must proceed dialectically, as this art teaches and instructs, namely, that no one is justified before God by the law or good works, for no one keeps them, nor does they do them fully; therefore faith makes one just, if one hangs on the promise of God and takes hold of it, and God accepts and gives it out of pure grace, free of charge, without any merit or worthiness on our part, 


Then, according to the rhetoric, | would praise his life, for the sake of Christ, His dear Son. Such faith alone, saying that it is a very quiet, prosperous, safe life, and] which the Holy Spirit works in the heart through the 


| would exhort him to it by persuasion and admonish him from any other way of life by dissuasion. If | want to rebuke, | condemn their vices and exaggerate their crude nature. 


15, another question. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 779.) 


Dialectic does not give the ability to talk about every thing, but it is a tool to talk about a thing, which we know. That | should speak dialectically about the mine, | can't, because | don't know how to sink 1) or to dig, or how to paint the tunnels, as the miners know. But if | tried to do that, I'd want to talk about it better than any miner. It teaches not the thing, but the order of speaking. 

(Here, one paragraph is omitted because it forms the conclusion of Cordatus No. 777, which we have included in Appendix No. Il. - After that, two paragraphs are omitted because they are contained in Cap. 45, §36.) 

Dialectics is a useful and necessary art, which one should study and learn at a reasonable price, like arithmetic and arithmetic. And although some astute 


minds can naturally deduce and calculate something} Alexander's 


Word and Sacraments, makes righteous and a happy conscience. This justification, how one becomes righteous before God, is righteous and certain. 

So, if one wanted to act on this saying, "Unless your righteousness is better than that of the Pharisees and scribes, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven," Matt. 5:20, the word "better" must be understood correctly and dialectically, for it does not mean doing many laws and works like the Pharisees, but the righteousness of faith is necessary for our obedience. 

(Medicina ... Sinners at Cordatus No. 90.) 

Medicina makes the sick, mathematica makes the sad, theologia makes sinners. Dialectica is necessary to be used, not only in schools, but also in consistories, courts, and churches, where it is most needed: for often a bad argument makes a noise and fog before one's eyes; but if one looks at it rightly, at each piece in particular, one can easily guard against error and deceit. As in the argument that Demosthenes, the most eloquent Greek, put forward against King Philip of Macedonia, the great father: although it had a _ great

those of Athens and the whole of Greece; namely, this: He that hath an evil thing hath no fortune in it: Philip the Macedonian 


1534 Cap. 67. Of schools, universities and good arts. § 15-19. 


King, has an evil thing, therefore he will have no luck. 

This argument made those of Athens safe and presumptuous; for they did not know that the godless bad boys are generally the most blissful, and it is best for them, according to the common saying: The greater the mischief, the better the luck. That is why one cannot do without dialecticam; and _ the disputations, so that things are done sensibly and demurely and the ‘right truth is sought, with seriousness without bickering, are of great benefit to young people, so that they are well practiced in them. 


16. difference between dialectics and rhetoric. (The first paragraph of this § at Cordatus No. 282.) 


Dialectic teaches, rhetoric moves; the former addresses the mind, the latter the will. Paul has summed up both Rom. 12 [7. 8.], saying, "If any man teach, let him wait for teaching; if any man exhort, let him wait for exhortation." And these two constitute the [proper] way of preaching, concerning which many things were said in former times, but very unskillfully. But there is a third thing added, which makes the preaching clear, which also belongs to the speakers. This is done by means of scriptures, examples, parables and other such ornaments, by which the listeners can be made to believe and obey the words you preach. But it is an exhortation when you say: Oh, | would like you to follow me and believe. The entire fourth chapter to the Romans is rhetorical, except for one passage where he explains what faith and justification are. 

The noblest fruit and use of dialectics is to define and describe a thing finely, briefly and actually, which it certainly is. Therefore, one should be accustomed to good, righteous, intelligible words, which are in common use and indicate and give a thing actually and understandably; which is a special grace and gift of God, whoever is able to do so; for many rascals and clever ones often darken a thing deliberately, with strange, unusual words, devise new ways of speaking, so that one is not able to understand it. 


1535 


are doubtful, two-faced, and screwed, which can be interpreted as one wishes, according to the circumstances, as the heretics do. 


17. what grammatica teaches. (Cordatus No. 664.) 


Grammar teaches what concerns the expression; what concerns the thing must first be learned. One who wants to preach must first know the thing and then the designation, namely, what the thing is of which he wants to speak. Grammar teaches only words that are signs of things, such as "the righteous lives by faith. Grammar says what faith is, what righteousness is. But to defend these words against the scoffers requires perfect art, and does not belong to grammar as well as to theology. 


18. from disputations. (Lauterbach, Oct. 11, 1538, p. 148.) 


After that, one spoke of the benefit of the disputations, which are called circulares, which would bring great benefit and training to the youth, and one leads the proud journeymen under the rut, so that they learn what kind of people they are. That is why | praise the young people for their arguments, even if they are not in order, and | dislike Philip Melanchthon's sharp manner, that he so soon takes the poor journeymen by surprise. For we must ascend step by step on one staircase to the other, for no one suddenly becomes the highest. 


19. weekly disputationes. (Lauterbach, Dec. 17, 1538, p. 192.) 

Luther praised the circular disputations very highly because these preliminary exercises served very well to train the minds of young people. In the past, these disputations were very frequent, but the material was lacking. Now that the material is available, we snore; therefore, God willing, we will establish them again. Even if the young people are not skilled at all, it is enough if only there is no evil will and presumption, but good will, according to the word: In great things it is enough to have the will [In magnis satis est voluisse] (Propert. 11, 8, 10. Tibuli. IV, 1, 7.). No one will at once 


1536 Cap. 67. Of schools, universities and good arts 


the highest. There is no tree that has not been a shrub before. Therefore we praise the will of the young. So also Augustine says: God crowns the [good] will inwardly, even if they do not have the ability outwardly; but the hope against the [good] will and the ability he puts to shame. 


20. eloquence, what it is. (Lauterbach, Nov. 25, 1538, p. 182.) 


Eloquence is not a far-fetched adornment of words, but a well-placed speech that presents a matter in a pithy manner and clearly, like a beautiful painting. But those who invent new words also introduce new things, like Scotus with his realitas, hiccitas, and the Anabaptists with their decoarsening, sprinkling, purification. One must beware of all who use new, unusual and uncommon words. For this way of speaking is completely contrary to eloquence. 


21. in schools, teaching and training. 


Anno 1539, on May 15, M. Ph. once again sent out his Dialecticam through the printing press; it was highly praised by D. M. Luther. For, he said, a man's noblest office, for which he was created, is to praise God, which is done by speaking and teaching: therefore 


1537 


The art of dialectics is to be praised highly, as through it God's praise and human society is preserved. Therefore, a faithful teacher is far above a warlord than one who protects and preserves only human society, body and goods; although the Scharrhansen think that it is they alone who carry heaven and earth. But let such companions go; the work praises its master, says Jesus Sirach Cap. 9, 24. 


-§ 19-22. 


22. schools maintain the church. 


If schools increase, it is well, and the church remains righteous; yes, so also the doctrine, which is pure. Let us only be called doctors and masters; young pupils and students are seeds and springs of the church. If we are dead, where would others be who would take our place if there were no schools? For the sake of the Church, Christian schools must be had and maintained: for God sustains the Church through schools, schools sustain the Church. They may not have a pretty reputation, but they are very useful and necessary. In schools, the little children have nevertheless learned the Paternoster, Our Father, and the faith, and the churches have been whimsically preserved through the little schools. 

The philosophia is the theologia of the pagans and reason: righteous, truthful histories, even among the pagans, point to God's will, like silent letters. 


The 68th chapter. Of Musica. 


1. from the music benefit and power. 2. from singing. 3. from David's music. 


1. from the music benefit and power. 

(The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 493.) A very good and divine gift is music, by which many temptations are dispelled. Therefore, the devil hates it very much and does not persevere with it. 1) 


1) Cf. Cap. 24, § 121, and § 2 and § 5 of this Cap. 


4. of secular and spiritual songs. 5. music should not be despised. 


(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 683.) 

Music is a very good art, through which the notes can bring the text to life. It drives away all sadness of spirit, as it is written by Saul. The nobles believe they have saved my most gracious lord three thousand florins a year on music, but in the meantime they are wasting it on him. 


1538 


useless thirty thousand guilders. Princes and kings must preserve music and the other arts. 

H[erzog] Georg, the Landgrave of Hesse, and H[erzog] Friedrich, Elector of Saxony, kept singers and cantors; now the Duke of Bavaria, King Ferdinand and Emperor Carl keep them. Therefore, it is found in the Bible that the pious kings ordered, kept and paid singers. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Aug. 8, 1538, p. 111.) 

Music is the best refreshment for a sorrowful person, if he sings even a little. As that [poet] said:Tu calamos inflare leves, Ego dicere versus. (Virg. Eclog. V, 2.) Sing thou the notes, and | will sing the words. 

Musica is half a discipline and disciplinarian, which makes people softer and gentler, more decent and more sensible. The evil fiddlers and violinists serve to make us see and hear how musica is one of his good arts: for white things can be better recognized if black things are held up against them. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, I7 Dec. 1538, p. 192.) 

On December 17, there were some singers who sang wonderful motets. Since Luther admired them, he said: "If our Lord God has given such noble gifts to the shithouse in this life, what will happen in that eternal life, where everything will be completely perfect and most lovely? But here is only the rough material [materia prima]. 

| have always loved musicam. He who knows this art is of a good nature, capable of everything. Musicam must be kept in schools because of necessity. A schoolmaster must be able to sing, otherwise | will not look at him. Young journeymen should not be appointed to the preaching ministry, for they have tried and practiced well in school. 

When some fine, lovely motets of Senfels were sung, D. M. Luther was astonished and praised them very much. M. Luther was astonished and praised them very much, and said: "I would not be able to make such a motet, even if | were to tear myself apart, just as he, in turn, would not be able to preach a psalm as | do. Therefore the gifts of the Holy Spirit are diverse, just as in one body there are many gifts. 


Cap. 68. Of the Musica. §1-4. 


1539 


are all limbs. But no one is satisfied with his gift, is not satisfied with what God has given him; they all want to be the whole body, not limbs. 


This paragraph to "skillful people" in Lauterbach, April 5, ( 1538, p. £6.) 


Afterwards, in the house of D. Wolf ReiBenbusch, singers were singing at the table, Luther said: "Music is an excellent gift of God and the closest to theology. | did not want to deprive myself of my little music [for] something great, and the youth must be accustomed to this art, it makes fine skilful people. The beautiful, excellent gift of God, to speak, is very strange in the world; for although all men are especially born to speak, and many can speak languages, yet speaking is a strange gift. Gregory Bridge can talk. 


2. singing. (Cordatus No. 468.) 

Singing is the best art and exercise. A singer has nothing to do in the world. For singers do not have to deal with disputes in courts of law, do not worry and are not sad, but shake off all sorrows from their hearts. 


3. David's Musica. 


Doctor M. Luther once said to a harpist: "Dear, play me a little song like the one David played. | think that if David were to rise from the dead now, he would be very surprised at how high people would get with music. It has never been higher than now. When David played the harp, it would be like the Magnificat anima mea Dominum, in octavo tono, because David did not have a decachordum. 


4. of western and spiritual songs. 


And further said: How is it that in Carnalibus we have so many fine poems and so many beautiful Carmen, and in Spiritualibus we have so coldly lazy things; et recitabat aliquas Germanicas cantilenas, den. 


1540 


Thurnier from the full. | think this is the reason, as St. Paul says Rom. 7, 23: Video aliam legem repugnantem in membris meis, it does not want to flow there, it does not happen there as it does there. In Ecclesiasticis commendabat praecipue illud: Vita in ligno. Et dicebat, tempore Gregorii illud et similia esse composita, ante ejus tempora non fuisse. There have been some fine schoolmasters and parish priests who have made such carmina and poemata, and received them accordingly. The schools did most of the work in the church, and the parish priests were the ecclesiastics, and they worked. No one else took care of the youth. After that, it was corrupted by the monasteries and the convents, which were also schools at first, sed cum creverunt opibus, so they put off the work. The dear Mother of God, Mary, had much more beautiful singing and more than her child Jesus. 


Cap. 68. Of the Musica. § 4. 5. 





1541 


A beautiful sequence is sung in Advent: Mittitur ad Virginem etc.. It is not so coarse, but rather well- crafted. St. Mary has been celebrated more in grammatica, musica and rhetorica than her child, Jesus. 


5. do not despise the musicam. 


Who despises the musicam (said D. M. Luther), as all enthusiasts do, | am not satisfied with them. For the Musica is a gift and present of God, not a gift of man. Thus it also drives away evil, and makes people happy: one forgets all anger, unchastity, pride, and other vices. According to theology, | give musica the closest locum and highest honor. And one sees how David and all the saints have put their godly thoughts into verses, rhymes and songs. Quia pacis tempore regnat Musica. 


The 69th chapter. 


Of languages. 


1. of the Greek, Hebrew and Latin languages. 2. languages are preserved by God alone. The tongue is the instrument of speech. 


1. of the Greek, Hebrew and Latin languages. 

(Cordatus No. 991. 992. 997. 998. 955. 956. 1615. 1616. 

1617. 1618.) 

The wisdom of the Greeks, compared to the wisdom of the Hebrews, is quite animalistic, because without the knowledge of the true God there can be no true wisdom. The purpose of their wisdom is virtue, but the wisdom of the Jews is to trust and fear God, and yet the Greek wisdom is very pleasing to the world. That is why Daniel calls all the kingdoms of the earth beasts. 

The Greeks spoke with the best and sweetest words, the Hebrew language 


but stands out for such simplicity and majesty that it cannot be imitated. The evangelist John almost imitates it. For what do you think that these are words: In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with GOD 2c.? He expresses the highest majesty with the simplest words. If an imitator of Plautus or Virgil were to write such things, he would have used only strange stuff of words, as those did who spoke of the being [de ente] and of the essence [essentia], of the heavenly and divine impetus [impetu]. 

they do not designate anything understandable. 


1542 


The Hebrew language is the best and richest in root words and is a pure language. It does not go begging, it has its own color. Not so the Greek, Latin and German languages, they all go begging and have many compound words, like the German words: Mitlaufen, fortlaufen, eilendlaufen, weglaufen 2c. 

The word heart has a very multiple use among the Germans: He has no heart, Das Herz sagt mirs, Sein Herz brennt ihm, i.e. he is angry; for each of these the Hebrew has a special word in the Hebrew language. 

All languages are intermingled; for, since the regions are adjacent to each other, they borrow individual words from each other. The Bohemian language is largely Scythian, the Hebrew language was corrupted after the Babylonian [captivity], and the same thing happened to the Hebrews as to the Italians, who made Italian out of Latin. Thus those have mixed their language with the Chaldean. And although | can speak neither Greek nor Hebrew, | want to meet a Greek and a Hebrew fairly. 

The languages in themselves do not make a theologian, but are a means of help, because one must know the thing before the languages can express it. And | speak a kind of general language and not a special one, therefore | can be understood in Lower and Upper Germany. | speak according to the Saxon chancellery, whose language all princes of Germany borrow [for use]. Maximilian and Frederick have thus brought the entire empire to a certain way of speaking, have thus drawn all language into one another. 

The Hebrew language is completely despised out of godlessness, or perhaps because one despairs of learning it [artis]. Although the phrases and the constructiones cannot be taught, they can be communicated grammatically, although the sentence connection can be taught grammatically. 


1) In the original: thematibus. Both ancient grammarians call the root word in contrast to derived and compound words. (Wrampelmeyer.) 


Cap. 69. Of the languages. §1. 


1543 


changes the meaning of the words. As when | say, Do after me, this is an expression that refers only to imitation [imitative]. But if | say: | will do it before, then do it after me, this is an expression that refers to what precedes [processive dictum]. Thus the connection changes the words, and | have by comparison of different passages 

more than by [strict] observation of the grammar. Without this language there can be no knowledge of the Scriptures, for even the New Testament, although it is written in Greek, is full of Hebrew idiom [hebraismis]. That is why it has been said that the Hebrews drink from springs, the Greeks from books, and the Latins from puddles. | am not a Hebrew as far as grammar is concerned, nor do | want to be one, because | do not want to be bound by rules, but | move freely, in this language. For whoever has the gifts for languages, he cannot immediately translate from one language into the other, and to interpret is a special gift of God. 

The seventy interpreters (septuaginta) did not know the Hebrew language, therefore their translation is nothing, although they have words and phrases, and we prefer the translation of Jerome to them, although we confess that he does not judge right who calls Jerome a good Hebrew; he does him violence. But he has something to excuse him, namely, that this language was so corrupted after the Babylonian captivity that it could not be restored. 

If Moses and the prophets came back now, they would not understand their own language; so corrupt is this language, like everything else that is truly GOD's, and the Latin language is so corrupt that even Cicero would not understand what is written after his time, if he revived. 

Lyra was the best Hebrew before others and a diligent interpreter of the Old Testament. If | were to lay on this language anew, | would consult the grammarians, especially the best, such as DavidA Kimchi and Moses Kimchi, who have been the purest. After that, | would read Moses. 


1544 Cap. 69. Of the lanquages. § 1-3. 1545 


because of its special meaning, then David, then the proverbs, and finally the prophets who speak figuratively. 


2. languages are obtained from God alone. (Cordatus No. 1619.) 

Great are the gifts of languages; therefore they are not respected by people, and so it is absolutely necessary that they be exalted only by God, and [even then] they (like all arts) have appeared only among a few and private persons, and so they appear now. 


The tongue is the instrument of speech. (The first paragraph of this § in Lauterbach, 1 Dec. 1538, p. 184.) 


Luther said of the wonderful work of God on the human tongue, which could produce articulate and intelligible sounds and words, although different nations have different dialects. The Greeks produce their X [r] only through the throat with a certain breath, so that it became very difficult for Demosthenes to pronounce the letter X, but at last he overcame the natural defect through practice. For through too much moisture of the brain the 


Tongue heavy (as perceived in drunkards) and too much dryness weakens the tongue. God has given nature its tool. 

No language has so many fancy, figurative words as the Hebrew. In the epistle of St. Peter there is not a single simple word. Moses and David wrote badly and plainly. Solomon is different. The Greeks have a lot of propria, own, clear words. To speak properly and intelligibly is a special gift of God; figurative and foggy speeches are rarely used and should be finely sweet. 

Since we were translating the Bible, spoke D. M. Luther, | gave them, who helped me, these rules: First, the Holy Scriptures speak of divine works and things. Second, if a saying and opinion agrees with the New Testament, accept it. Thirdly, that one has respect for the grammaticam. 


(The following at Cordatus No. 488.) 


When translating, | always keep this rule, that one does not violate grammar. And whoever understands this correctly recognizes that the letter gives [the right meaning], not the spirit. 


The 70th chapter. 


Of astronomy and star art. 


1. of the movement of the heavens and the course of the stars. 2. how far one should approve astronomy. 3. argumenta and concluding speeches Against Astrology. 


1. of the movement of the heavens and the course of the stars. 


(Cordatus No. 909. 910. and 523.) 


Astronomy is the oldest science and has brought with it many arts. It was very well known to the ancients and especially to the Hebrews, who observed the course of the heavens very carefully. About them God spoke to the 


4. a different Against astrology. 5. from the seventh year, which is a gradual year. 


Abraham [Gen. 15:5], "Look toward heaven and count the stars." 

Heaven has a threefold movement. The first is the original one, by which it happens that the whole machine of the sky is undoubtedly turned around completely by the angels in twenty-four hours. In this short period of time, such a great mass is moved about a thousand miles. If 


1546 


If the sun and the stars were made of iron, or of any other metal, they would soon melt in such an impetuous course. The second movement is that of the planets, and is carried out by individual spirits; the third is trembling, which one has recently invented and which is quite uncertain. 

| praise the astronomy and the mathematics which deal with proofs, to the astrology | attribute nothing. 


2. how far one should approve Astronomiam. (The first paragraph in Cordatus No. 1183.) 


Astronomy is not to be approved insofar as it predicts what will happen to everyone. But it is to be approved as a gift of God, if it remains within its limits. Chiromancy, however, is to be condemned. It is true that the soothsayers can predict what kind of death an ungodly person will die, for he [the devil] knows the counsels and thoughts of the ungodly, for he is the prince of the world. But there are twofold signs, of times and of events. The signs of the times are certain because they are from the Word. 

There was a new astrologer who wanted to prove that the earth moved and circulated, not the sky or the firmament, the sun and the moon; as if someone sitting on a chariot or in a ship and being moved thought he was sitting still and at rest, but the earth and the trees circulated and moved. But now it is like this: whoever wants to be wise should not let others please him; he must make something of his own, which must be the very best, the way he does it. The fool wants to reverse the whole art of astronomy. But as the holy scripture indicates, Joshua called the sun to stand still, not the earth. Jos. 10, 12. 13. 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 169.) 


In the stars there is not a power, but a meaning. Therefore, we have a just complaint against the astrologers who attribute to them a power which God did not put into them, and that they usually interpret it in the worst way. This should rather have been 


Cap. 70. Of astronomy and astrology. § 1. 2. 


1547 


to the comets, which foreshadow only evil, with the exception of the star that appeared to the wise men [from the East], for this signified that the revelation of the Gospel was already present. 


(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 1056.) 


The passages of Scripture can be mocked, but not refuted. Our eloquent people, who now give public lectures, dare to say that the passage Jeremiah 10:2 is to be understood of the signs of the Gentiles. Moses also speaks of the signs of the heavens, and praises astronomy very little, and of the signs of the earth and of the sea; but the heathen were not so foolish as to fear the sun, or the moon, but the strange and marvelous appearances [portenta ac monstra] they reverenced as well as they feared them. And astronomy, for which they argue so assiduously, is not an art, because it has no foundations or proofs, but they indicate everything from the occurrence and the accidental events [ex eventu et casibus], and from what has happened once, they conclude that it will happen every time. What is true, they know; what is missing, they keep silent. Art exists (they are forced to confess that), but nobody has it. They do not have the experience (that is, to make a conclusion from many individual things to the general]), but some events and indeed very uncertain ones. 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 1136.) 


| have come so far and have brought astronomy so far that | believe it is nothing, although Philip thinks that the art is there, but one has no artists. This they have invented in the almanac [as] certain, that one should not put snow in summer, nor thunder in winter; that one should [not] 1) sow in spring and [not] 1) reap in autumn, that the farmers also know well. 


1) The "not", which is in both places in the original, should probably be missing; because although the winter grain is sown in autumn and harvested in July, the sowing time is generally in spring and the harvest in autumn. In Bindseil Il, 151 "not" is missing. 


1548 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 1243.) 

The astronomers are very unhappy, who impose on themselves from the celestial bodies sufferings that God does not interpret; therefore they always advertise defeated; for example, when they say that the people who are born in the balance after midnight become unhappy. 

Astrologia is uncertain. Just as the predicaments in the Dialectica are fictitious words; so Astronomia has the fictitious Astrologiam: and as the ancient theologians knew nothing of the schoolteacher's imagination and theology; so the ancient astronomers knew nothing of Astrologia. 

D. M. Luther had his Nativity, Ciceronis and many others printed at Nuremberg; there he said: | do not think anything of it, do not agree with them at all, but | would like them to give me this argument: Esau and Jacob are born of one father and one mother, at one time, and under the same star, and yet of a very repugnant nature, kind and mind. Summa, what happens from God and is his work, that is not to be attributed to the stars. Ah, heaven does not ask about this, just as our Lord God does not ask about heaven. The true Christian religion confutes and refutes such fairy tales and fables. The world, apart from religion, is Lucian and Epicurean, as Erasmus was: he disputed whether it would be useful and advisable for a philosopher and scholar to put himself under the yoke of matrimony and take a wife. Blessed is he who obeys God's word in faith! 

Astrology is a fine art, but very uncertain, one finds no one who could indicate and prove something certain: it requires good interpretation and much thought, as our canons of Meissen are doing now, who want to defend their thing with interpretation. 

When one of them showed D. M. Luther a nativity (as it is called), he said: It is a fine funny fantasy and pleases reason, because one always goes neatly from one line to the other. Therefore, the way of making and calculating nativity, and the like, is like the pontifical, since the outward ceremonies, ostentation 


Cap. 70. Of astronomy and astrology. §2. 





1549 


and order of reason, as the consecrated water, candles, organs, cymbals, singing, ringing and interpreting 2c. But it is not a true science and certain knowledge, and those who want to make a certain art and knowledge out of this thing are very much mistaken, since there is none; for it does not come from the nature of astronomy, which is an art; this is man's proposition. 

That astrology is a certain knowledge and art, no one will persuade Philip yet. Philip has often tried and tried hard to persuade me to approve his opinion and to agree with him; but he has never been able to persuade me to do so, nor to get me to do so; | stand firm and firm on the opinion that the peasants have, with whom | hold that when there is a hot summer, it is followed by a cold winter. This whole business is against philosophy. 

| have often talked to Philip about it, and told him my whole life, how it has gone one after the other, and how | have done it. | am a farmer's son, my father, grandfather and ancestor were real farmers. Then he said: | would have been a governor, mayor, home burger, and whatever other offices they have in the village, or some kind of chief servant over the others. After that, | said, my father went to Mansfeld and became a miner there; that's where | came from. 

But that | have become a baccalaureate, a master, a monk 2c. is not written in the stars. But have | not brought great shame upon myself, that | have become a monk, that | have laid aside the little brown beret, and brought it to others? Which, indeed, made my father angry and hurt him; nevertheless, | fell into the pope's hair, and he fell into mine again, took a runaway nun as my wife, and fathered several children with her; who saw this in the stars? Who would have told me before that this would happen? 

The astrologer 1) and stargazer reminds me like one who carries dice for sale and says: Behold, | have good dice, they cast 


1) So Stangwald instead of: Astrologia. 


1550 


Cap. 70. Of astronomy and astrology. §2. 3. 


1551 





always twelve. Well, you often pointed out that when you get twelve, the art is right. But one does not see how often one has thrown 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 before. So do the astrologers; if it comes true once or twice, they cannot praise, extol and exalt the art enough; but of the other, which has failed so often, they remain silent. 

Astronomiam | accept, and | like it because of its manifold use: for the dear David remembers in the Psalter, in the 19th Psalm, v. 2. ff, of the marvelous work and creature of God in the firmament of the heavens and the stars, and takes pleasure in it; as also Job remembers the Orionis, which is called Peter's or Jacob's staff, the seven-pointed star and the Gluckhenne 2c., Job 38, 31. The example of Esau and Jacob makes their whole art a jugglery, and to shame. They pave themselves with it all the time. 


3rd argument” and final speeches against astrology. 


1) The doctrine that deals with matter is uncertain; for matter is informal, shapeless, without form, and without some quality and skill. The astrologers’ and stargazers' doctrine deals with matter; therefore it is uncertain. 

2) Common prophecies and proclamations, where one proclaims something in general beforehand, how it should turn out, do not rhyme nor do they refer to individual and special things and persons, non competunt specialibus et individuis. But astrology and stargazing doctrine have common praedictiones and proclamations, which cannot be directed to individual things; therefore, stargazers and astrologers do wrong by drawing them to particular, individual, certain things and people. 

3) If many of them are killed, shot or slain at the same time in a battle, they were not born and raised in the same star? And yet they all die at the same time in one hour, yes, often in a flash, especially from the gun. M. Luther answered and said: Philippus solvirt's so: Generalia cedere specialibus, gemeinere Rede und Anzeigung weichen. 


particular and individual. Then D. M. Luther laughed and said to Philip: "Ergo, so you say yourselves and confess that your Astrologia teaches and understands only what is common: as Philip has often said to me before that it is a flat, straight force. And they say of an even clear force and effect, and that the star gives an affection, but does not require it: and be not their, the astrologers’, opinion, that it must happen and proceed straight thus and not otherwise. Yes, said D. M. Luther, you say it and interpret it from certain people and places, and, what is even more and the greatest, you affirm it and proclaim it beforehand to this and that country that it will happen this way. Oh, what can | say? You are rough fellows, you presume much that is impossible for you. 

But he, Philip, remained on his opinion, defended astrology, and spoke: They speak of matter, that thus could happen, and that matter would be skillful and capable for such a thing. Then D. M. Luther laughed out loud and said: "What else is this said, than if Greger Tischer came to me and said: "A table can be made out of the board, yes, a table or something else can be made out of it. But what is this said? What do you presume to say about all things so certainly, as if none of the things you say could be missing? 

But what you say about matter is nothing, because it is without all quality and skill, and informis, has no form nor shape. This said D. M. Luther, when he spoke of the hour in which the fruit is conceived in the womb, after which they, the astrologers, use to make and erect the nativities and praedictiones. And refuted and disproved him, when he said: The seed would be the matter; which D. M. Luther denied, but said for constant and certain: It would be a substantia, a self- existent thing, not a matter, because the same would be informis, without all quality, would have no form nor shape. 

| believe that M. P. Astrologia and astrology are the same as drinking a strong drink of wine or beer when | have thoughts. 


1552Cap 


4, against astrology. 

In the first place, the Astrologia is regarded as such a trade as the Sophists de decem Praedicamenitis realiter distinctis, essentially different from the ten words which they call Praedicamenta; since everything is false and fictitious, although such vanity whimsically agrees and rhymes’ with arguments, Solutionibus, and other trades, so that in so many hundred years, among so many sects, Thomists, Albertists, Scotists, nothing has been considered so true as the same. Secondly, they do not teach you what you should know most of all, but how long you should live: they do not say anything certain beforehand, neither time nor place: it is only a vain mystery: they only show the person, and often lack it. Third, God has set a certain end. Babylon otherwise said: | will remain seated. Rome said: | have been given the reign without end; item, Alexandro and the other empires and kingdoms. Aftrology teaches nothing of this, that such great empires should be, nor how long they would stand and remain. Fourth, it was invented and fabricated by the devil, so that people would be deterred from the state of marriage and all divine and human offices and states. For they say nothing good of the heavenly bodies, make consciences fear future misfortune, which is uncertain and in God's hands, and vex and torment the whole life by such suspicion and useless thoughts. Fifthly, God's creatures do violence and injustice, for God created them and set them in the firmament to illuminate the earth, that is, to make it joyful, and to be good signs of the years and times, as Genesis 1:10 and the 5th book of Moses say: "And God saw that it was good"; and: "Which the Lord thy God hath ordained unto all nations under the whole heaven. 

But they, the stargazers, and those from the stars, want to prophesy and proclaim how one should fare, inventing that they darken and afflict the earth and are harmful. For all creatures of God are good, and created by God only for good use. But

Man makes them evil with his abuse. And they are signs, not monsters. The eclipses are monsters and monstra, like abortions. 

D. M. Luther said about the foolishness of the Mathematicorum and Astrologorum, the stargazers, who had said about a flood or great waters, so Anno 1524 should come, which nevertheless did not happen; but the following 25th year the peasants were delayed, and became rebellious. Astrologus did not say a word about this. But he spoke of the mayor Hohndorf: he had a quarter of beer brought up to his house, and wanted to wait there for the flood, as if he would not have anything to drink when it came. But at the time of the wrath there was a conjunctive called sin and God's wrath, which was a_ different conjuncture than the one in the 24th year. 

(Cordatus No. 864. 865.) 

Believing the stars is idolatry against the first commandment. Ezekiel is against it... 

If we strike the Turk away, Daniel will be gone and the Last Day will certainly be present. 


5. Septimus annus Climactericuse (Cordatus No. 1490.) 

My Hans goes into the seventh year. This [every seventh year] is always a step year, that is such a one, which brings a change with itself. The seventh year always changes the people. For the first change is childhood, and in the second change, namely with the fourteenth year, they begin to see into the world, and it is the boyhood, in which the foundation of the arts is laid, in the one and twentieth the young men desire marriage, in the eighth and twentieth the young men are householders and fathers of families, but the men are in secular and ecclesiastical offices in the fifth and thirtieth years, until the second and fortieth years, then we are kings, and soon after we begin to gradually decline. Thus, the seventh year always brings a new situation its new] people, [new] customs. This has happened to me and happens to all, 1)

for his name's sake, that he not be blasphemed. As if to say: | will give the boys another good year; therefore let us pray for daily bread. 

Since there was a very fertile weather in the sky, M. Luther said with a sigh: "Oh, praise God, this is a beautiful weather! God is merciful, who gives such things to the unworthy and undeserving, so that we would also become more pious. If this were to happen, we would have paradise and heaven here. All plagues and everything that is annoying and repugnant to us would be changed and would cease, caterpillars, ants, butterflies and all worms and vermin would not harm our fruit, but everything would grow and bear sweetly. But the punishment of original sin goes on in the whole world, over all creatures. Now, in Thuringia and Meissen, the seed must be scraped with great lust; but we Saxons here may not, therefore we have a harvest before them. 

Since a very merry time and beautiful weather was in May, which is a figure of the resurrection, D. M. Luther said: Behold, how the trees mate and marry 1) each other! How sweetly green it is! How delicious a May is this, the like of which | do not remember. Since it thus continues, then a very good and fruitful year will become, as the world is also full. Oh, that we could trust in God! What will become of that life, if God can show such pleasure in this pilgrimage and miserable life? 

Anno 1539, den 10. Junii, kam ein groB greulich Wetter, welches eil: Ungllick bedeutet, so vorhanden war; da sprach D. M. Luther: "Oh, how many ways God has to humble us, and yet cannot bring us to humble ourselves and to recognize and call upon Him through righteous repentance and faith. This evening there came a very fruitful and sweet rain, which moistened the ground. After that he said: Oh, we do not know what theurung and hunger are. Look at the time of the prophet Elijah, what distress and famine there was, when in three years and six months there was no famine. 


1) So Stangwald instead of: zuehelichen. 


Cap. 71. Of signs and distance. § 1. 2.

and all the wells were dried up, so that all men and animals died of hunger, and only the king's horses and those of his counselors remained alive. For Elijah said, "As surely as the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom | stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain for these years, | tell you. And so he departed, 1 Kings 17:1. | think that they took Eliam for a sorcerer, and sought after him in all places. 

As there was beautiful weather at harvest time, D. M. Luther: "This year our dear Lord God has done everything according to our will, has miraculously given us peace, and has controlled the impending wars and bloodshed. He blesses us with fruit and grain in the midst of the storm. He is equal to us, as the saying in Psalms says: "He does what the godly desire, and hears their cry, and helps them", Ps. 145, 19. But what do we do? Yes, God freely despised, cursed, blasphemed. Then all misfortune must follow, that he will have to retract his hand. 


(2) Satan's prophecies are screwed and two-faced. (Cordatus No. 672. 673.) 


Since | am asked, because the devils always give ambiguous answers, how they would have answered certain things in relation to Saul through the supposed Samuel: Tomorrow you will be with me [1 Sam. 28, 19.], | answer: In the expression "tomorrow" there is an ambiguity, he. has met or missed, this day or the other. 

It is certain that the devil does not know the certain outcome, yes, he answers ambiguously. It is called turning screws, if he cannot deny or assert with certainty and yet does not want to keep quiet. So also Christ answers about the interest of the emperor [Matth. 22, 20. 21.], so Abraham delivered his wife to the king [Gen. 20, 2.], so David fought against Amalek with the godless king and said to Achish [1 Sam. 29, 8.]: | will fight with my lord 2c., since the text says that he hid his face. That is, in courtly, turned screws, in German: ausdrehen.

The 72nd chapter. Of studies.

3. of various arts and crafts. 

4. of the infidelity of craftsmen. 


1. good books, and the little, you should read often. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 1138.) 

A student who does not want to lose his effort should read and reread any good writer in such a way that it becomes second nature to him. For useless reading [lectiones -- lectures] confuses, but does not teach. Likewise, reading many but good things makes the student one who is at home everywhere, and therefore nowhere. And just as in human society we do not cultivate friendship with every single friend every day, but with select ones, so it should be in study. 

Anno 1538, on the 15th day of August, a fine, skilful student fell into madness, worked and made himself weak and unwell with constant waking and talking. The cause of his illness was that he had lain too much over the books and was fond of a maiden. With the latter, D. Martin Luther dealt with her in the most friendly way, waited for her to get better, and said: "That love was the cause of his illness, but study would bring this effect and effect in very few; just as something similar had happened to him in the beginning of the Gospels. 

He told an example of a student who had been his room-mate in Erfurt for two years. He said that he did not look at a book, but at last, since he had been admonished so often to stop for a full week, when he had done so and had sat for half an hour looking at the book, he got up, became angry, threw the book on the ground, stepped on it with his feet, and said, "Do you want to make me foolish? Studeo, Studes, Studui, Studere habet Stultum in Supino: Studiren macht zu Narren. 





5. from the painters. 6. the art of the seig. 7. from the exercise with singing and fencing. 


2. from comedies. (Cordatus No. 1709.) 

Comedies must be recited by the boys, first, so that they have practice in the Latin language; then the people are instructed by the fictional characters, and each is reminded of his office. Moreover, the cunning plots of immoral women are set forth, and how parents should exalt their children in honor, and how children should obey their parents in it. And if the comedies should not be performed among Christians because of some offensive [obscoena] things, the Bible should not be read either. But he who takes offense at such things takes offense where no one gives it. 

(This paragraph in Lauterbach, May 29, 1538, p. 89.) 

| like the comedies of the Romans, whose main purpose was to encourage young people to marry. For the world regiment cannot exist without the marriage state. That is why those reasonable people enticed the youth to marriage in the best possible way by means of comedies, as well as by means of pictures; for fornication and a life without marriage are the ruin of the state. 


3. of various feats and crafts. (Lauterbach, Aug. 4, 1538, p. 107.) 

After that, the Fugger was shown handwriting that changed the letters in various ways so that no one could read it. He said: This is invented by the best minds, and is caused by very evil times, as one reads of Julius Caesar, that he also used such letters. And itis said that our Emperor Carl because of the infidelity 


1560 Cap. 72. of studies. 


He said that he always writes two letters to his scribes on important matters, which have opposite meanings, and then he secretly seals one of them without them knowing. 


4. of the infidelity of craftsmen. (Lauterbach, Aug. 4, 1538, p. 111.) 


He said a lot about the proud behavior and carelessness of the craftsmen, who had too little care and too much pay. | have enough cloth, but | don't want to have pants made. | have mended this pair of pants four times myself, and | will mend them even more before | have new ones made, because it is not diligence: it takes a lot of fabric, but gives no chic. That's why they have it very well arranged in Italy, where the tailors have a special guild that only makes pants. Here they cast pants, dusters, skirts, everything in one mold. 


5. from painters. 


In 1539, February 9, Luther spoke of German painters, how skillful and meaningful they were, because they could follow and imitate nature so masterfully and actually in paintings, that they not only give the right natural color and shape to all limbs, but also the gesture, as if they lived and moved. 

Flanders follows and imitates them to a certain extent; for the Dutch, especially the Flemings, are mischievous and cunning, and soon and easily learn foreign languages. 


§3-7. 1561 They have a nimble and ready tongue, and if you were to take a flaming in a sack through Italy or France, he would soon learn the language. 


6. the art of the seig. (Cordatus No. 968.) 


Wonderful is the invention of a clock that tells the time so accurately. If it could talk, it would really have the office of a human being. 


7. exercise with singing and fencing. 


It is, said D. M. Luther, very well considered and ordered by the ancients that the people exercise themselves, and intend something honest and useful, so that they do not get into revelry, fornication, eating, drinking and playing. That is why | like these two exercises and amusements best of all, namely musica and jousting, with fencing, wrestling 2c., among which the first drives away the sorrow of the heart and melancholy thoughts; the other makes fine dexterous limbs on the body, and keeps it in health with jumping 2c. The final cause is also that one does not get into carousing, fornication, gambling and doubling; as one sees now, unfortunately, in courts and in cities, there is no more, because: It's up to you! Drink up! After that, people gamble for several hundred or more guilders. So it goes, if one despises such honorable exercises and knightly games and lets them go.

1. future shortage of learned people. 1) (Cordatus No. 433.) 


Before two years will have passed, we will experience a shortage of learned men that one would like to cut them out of boards and dig them out of the earth if only one could. One sins against God too much now. 


The world cannot be governed without learned people. (Cordatus No. 1054.) 

Scholarship, wisdom and the scribes shall rule the world, and if [God] once in His wrath took away all the scholars from the world, what would the remaining people be but cattle? And the law, yes, even the word itself, is nothing without lawyers and preachers, whose service God uses as people He may not do without. Where there are not wise people through the word and the laws, bears, lions, goats and dogs hold the world's rule and preside over the household. 


3. few history writers. (Lauterbach, Nov. 25, 1538, p. 179.) 

One spoke of the small number of historians at all times, especially of Germany. He said: Yes, who wants to write histories and write the truth without great hatred? For the character of the Greeks was very cunning, that of the Italians hopeful, the Germans wild. Livius wrote in praise of the Romans, not the Carthaginians. Blondus and Platina flatter only the popes. The Italians were more temperate before they ruled, but when they gained sole rule, they degenerated. Now that [Italy] is humbled, it hopes to rule again. For the pope does not allow the emperor and Ferdinand to plunder the church estates in vain. 


4, from Cicero and Aristotle. (The first paragraph Cordatus No. 522.) | can't help but wonder why now the philosophy of Aristotle is being 


1) Cf. cap. 22, § 94. 


Cap. 73. of scholars. 


§1-5. 1563 and not rather that of Cicero, a man who was overwhelmed with all kinds of affairs, as his "Officia" testify, which are much better than the books Ethicorum of Aristotle, a man who had no office, but an abundance of money. Cicero treats things, Aristotle dialectics; the latter has come very close to the knowledge of many Christian things, what his disputations of the soul, of the nature of the gods 2c. testify. Aristotle did not know these things, nor did he touch them, like the latter; also in his book Physicorum he disputed about the first author [motor], until he confused himself [usque ad implicationem sui]. 

Cicero has become a very wise man, has written more than all philosophers, and read through all the books of the Greeks. | am surprised that man, in so much business and dealings, has been able to read and write so much. No one really understands Ciceroni's epistles, unless he had been in an excellent regiment for twenty years. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, July 27, 1538, p. 103.) 


Then he mentioned Cicero, the best, wisest and most diligent man, how much he had suffered and done. | hope, he said, that our Lord God will also be merciful to him and his kind, although it is not up to us to say and determine this, but [we] should remain with what has been revealed: "He who believes and is baptized" 2c. (Marc. 16, 16.) But that God cannot slacken with others and make a distinction among other peoples, of this it is not for us here to know the time and manner. For there will be a new heaven and a new earth, much greater and wider; and He can reward each one according to his deserts. 


5. power of God's pure word. (Cordatus No. 1028.) 


Through experience we recognize the power of divine truth; for the more it is read, the more impression it makes. Cicero could not do that with all his eloquence; he cannot do it above himself. You must stay down. Otherwise | wonder very much 


1564 


about Cicero, that he wrote and read such great things under such great official duties. 


6. from Strabo. 


Strabo's writings and histories are very good, because he lived at the time of Emperor Augustus, and saw all the deeds and history in the camps and wars. But he writes of Moses that he was a sorcerer and had invented much idolatry. Then said D. Luther said, "It is true that the land of Canaan lies between Egypt and Syria, which were superstitious peoples, full of idolatry: therefore Canaan was undoubtedly also infected with sorcery and besmirched. 


7. of history writers and poets. 


How miserably have so many great, excellent histories and deeds perished, which are not described! only the Greeks and Romans have historians. Of Livius, hardly a small particle is left; the rest is obscured, lost and perished. Sabellicus wanted to follow and imitate him, Livius, but did nothing. 

Ovidius is an excellent poet, surpasses the others all with pretty sayings, which he masterfully and sweetly summarizes in verse. As: 

Nox et amor, vinumque nihil moderabile suadent. The night, the love, in addition the wine, to nothing good Rathgeber be. 

Is fine clear and light. 

Virgilius is superior to the others all with glory and bravery, heroica gravitate, is all imperious and important, with an earnestness. 


8. from Lucanus. 


When Luther had bought and read Lucanus, he said: "| do not know whether he is a poet or a historian. For thus they are distinguished: a historian says what is true; an orator and eloquent speaker, what is similar to truth; but a poet writes what is neither true nor similar to truth. Therefore Aristotle says: "Poets lie a great deal, for if they have a little cause, they make a thing very great. 


Cap. 73. of scholars. §5-11. 


1565 


and clean it up high. There must be a lot of lies. Like good painters, they paint a person much more beautiful than he is. 

Julius Caesar said: "As often as | read Brutus’ writings, | let myself think that |am eloquent; but when | read Ciceroni's Orationes, | am unspeaking and babble like a child. 


9. from Aesopus. (Lauterbach, Nov. 6, 1538, p. 158.) 


On Nov. 6, he read his preface to Aesop. He highly recommended this book because it was full of good teaching, manners and experience. Then he added: "He who can speak well is a man. For speech is wisdom, wisdom is speech. Speech comes from counsel, otherwise it is called washed and not spoken. Thus Aesopus speaks, he does not prate; he presents the matter and truth under the guise of a foolish fool, nor must he be persecuted for it. 


10. which books should be discarded. (Lauterbach, Sept. 15, 1538, p. 132.) 


After that, he said that it was very necessary that the books of Juvenal, Martial, Catullus and the Priapus of Virgil be removed from the plays and schools, because they were so mean and actor-like that they could not be read without harm. 


11. by some scholars of our time. (Cordatus No. 932 and No. 503.) 


Doctor Muth 1) believed that there was no God. Finally he despaired because of his poverty and killed himself with poison. He left a book about his religion, which he did not dare to publish during his life. Yes, Erasmus also wants to leave his faith behind, which he did not dare to confess during his life. Such people know what they do not want to talk about. They are knaves who want to measure everything according to their wisdom and 


1) This refers to the famous humanist Conrad Muth, called Mutianus Rutus (Mutz in the Latin manuscript is probably an abbreviation of Mutianus), since 1503 Canonicus at Gotha. He died in 1526 in the greatest misery. As far as is known, he did not leave a work about his views on religion. (Wmmpelmeyer.)

14. what and how to preach for the young milk Christians. 

(Kummer p. 304 d. [Lauterbach p. 141, note]). 

Long sermons destroy the devotion and the desire to listen in the listeners, and the preachers do themselves harm. He chastised Mag. Georg Major for his pusillanimity and told him not to look at those who were more learned than he, but to pay attention to the people so that he could teach them. One should pull out the teats on the preaching chair and feed the common people with milk, because a new church is growing up every day, which needs the first initial foundations. Therefore, only the catechism should be diligently practiced and the milk distributed; the high thoughts and strong wine should be kept private for the little ones. | do not want D. Pommer, Jonas, Philipp in my sermon, because they know better than | do. Nor do | preach to them, but to my Lenichen, Hansichen, Elsichen, to whom | pay attention. It would have to be a great gardener who wanted to cultivate only one flower in a large garden and neglect all the others. Therefore, see to it that you teach purely and simply. 


15. simple-minded preachers the best. 


Doctor M. Luther once said that Albrecht Durer, the famous painter at Nuremberg, used to say: He had no desire for pictures that were painted with many colors, but which were made in the most simple and fine bad way. So he said that he would also like to preach sermons, which went along fine simple, because one could understand what one preached. 


16. from Brentius. (Cordatus No. 352.)

And what he has accomplished in the interpretation of the Gospel of John, none of ours will accomplish. But if he sometimes dwells on his thoughts, this is to his credit, since he does not depart from the simple opinion of the Word.

17. by Bucerus. (This § in Kummer p. 291. [Lauterbach p. 66, note]). 


In the translation of my books, no one is better or more careful than M. Bucer, because he gives my meaning and opinion so actually, where he would not mix in his opinions of the Sacrament, that I, if | wanted to express my meaning with words and to show my opinion, could not do it more actually. 


(Also in Cordatus No. 351.) 


In the translation of my books, no one has ever been more careful, or one who has reproduced my meaning and opinion so accurately, than M. Bucer. But | do not approve of his opinions, which he has mixed in. 


18. by M. Ammerbach. 


Our disputation, said D. M. Luther, with M. Ammerbach is like that of the Lord Christ with Nicodemo; for Ammerbachius says: My opinion, yes Opinion, is that man becomes pleasant, just and blessed before God for the sake of good works. 


19. difference of the gifts. 


There was talk about how there was such a great difference among the scholars that they were not all the same who studied there, and that there were various different heads, and not all of them would awaken the dead with their art. Then said D. M. Luther said: "It is not given to all, nor to any: to whom God gives it, he has it. God has also divided it very finely, that the learned may serve the unlearned; again, the unlearned must humble himself before the learned, of which he has need. If all men were equal, no one could arise, no one would serve the other, there would be no peace. 

The peacock lamented that he had not the voice of the nightingale. Therefore, God has made the greatest equality with inequality; for we see that when one is something excellent, has more and greater gifts than another, he becomes arrogant and proud, wants to rule over all the others and despise them, and 


L570 Cap. 73: Of scholars 


-§ 19. 20. 1571 





rule. He thinks that his filth alone stinks. Therefore, God has very finely and well pictured and presented the human society among each other in the members of the human body, where there are many and unequal members, and one must reach out and help the other, none can do without the other. The most honest members are under the face, but the nose, the house of shame, must still be above the mouth and below the eyes. If only two people had noses, they would be considered monsters; but because we are all snotty and muddy, the nose makes us humble. After that, consider also the gifts of the belly and the buttocks, how necessary they are, as without them we could not live. A man can live without eyes, ears, hands, feet, but without the ars, to speak with breeding, no man can live. So great and necessary is the use and benefit of this one limb, the buttocks, which is such a limb that belongs to the essence and preservation of the human body. That is why St. Paul says 1 Cor. 12, 22. 23: "The members of the body, which seem to us to be the weakest, are the most necessary, and those which seem to us to be the most dishonest, to them we give the greatest honor." 


20. from Aristotle and Cicero. 


Aristotle is even an epicure, considers that God does not ask about human things, does not pay attention to what and how we do it. 


and go about, let us keep house as we please, as if it were none of his business: and since he believes it at once, he thinks that God rules the world, as a sleepy maid weighs a child. But Cicero has come much further. | believe that he has read and brought together what he has found good in all Greek scribes and teachers, in their books. For this is a very good argument, which has often moved me much and highly and has gone to my heart: that he proves from the fact that the living creatures, cattle and men, one begets and gives birth to the other, which is similar and like him, that there is one God. A cow always gives birth to a cow, a horse to a horse 2c. No cow gives birth to a horse, nor a horse to a cow 2c. Therefore it must follow irrefutably that there is something that governs all things. We can finely discern God from the certain and unchanging movement, course, and motion of the heavenly body in the sky. We find the sun rising and setting in its place every day; item, from certainty of time, that we thus have certain winter and summer. But because this is always and daily happening and common, we neither respect it nor wonder at it. But if a child were brought up in a dark place from his youth, and then let out in his twentieth year, he would wonder at the sun, what it was, and how it always had a certain course, how it had a certain time; but it is nothing to us, because what is common and happens daily is not respected.

1. the Jews fame. (Cordatus No. 1575.) 


All Jews have boasted that they are Abraham's children, and it has been a great glory to them, and the rich man, after he was buried, still said in hell: "Father Abraham", and on the other hand it is said to him [Luc. 16, 24. 25.]: "Son, you" 2c. But our Lord God can separate these children, to some He gives their reward here, to others in the life to come. But the Jews did not boast for Abraham's sake, but for their own glory, just as the clergy now boast of Christ, that they receive great fiefdoms. 


2. the Jews’ handling and superstition. 


Jews are the poorest of all peoples on earth, plagued here and there, scattered to and fro in countries, having no certain place where they can certainly stay, sitting like on a hovel, always worrying that they will be driven out, having neither land nor people, no regiment anywhere 2c. And yet they suffer it all, wait with great eagerness, console themselves and say: It will soon be better with us. So stubborn are they that they may still boast in the highest disgrace.

They are not allowed to work, nor to trade, nor to keep cattle, but to practice shameful usury and horse trading. They have innumerable statutes, like all those who do not want the One Faith of Christ, like the Papists and the Turks. And since they do not want freedom in Christ, they choose bondage for freedom. 


3. the Jews’ fame and stubbornness. (Cordatus No. 1172-1175.) 


It is a very certain sign of the exceedingly great wrath of God against the Jews that they have to be in exile like this and are constantly cast out from one country to another. And yet they do not cease to expect their Messiah and to boast about their privileges, which Paul also exalts in his letter to the Romans, but how he belittles them in the same letter, in the second chapter! 

To reject the fame and the reputation of the Jews became very sour to St. Paul Rom. 9, [4. 5.]. For since the world still stubbornly holds on to the pope, who sits in the temple of God without any word of God, what should the Jews have done to preserve their Judaism? It was no joy at all for Paul to say [Acts 13:46], "Behold, we turn to the Gentiles." 

If | were a Jew, | would rather be wheeled ten times than go to the pope. The papacy has given the Jews a great deal of trouble.

10. german and welschland has been stan full of jews. (Lauterbach, Aug. 29, 1538, p. 125.) 


After that they spoke about the flight of the Jews to Italy and Germany. For Cicero in the speech for Flaccus complains about the superstition of the Jews in Italy and we see all over Germany their traces. Is yet no city or village, it has names, signs and gapes [of Jews] and it is said that Jews have been in Regensburg and lived long before the time of Christ. They have been a great, powerful people. 


11. Jews are blasphemers. 


When it was said of the blasphemies of the Jews, who now at this time read our books and writings, and from the same dispute against us, 2c. M. Luther: "They are a people who only blaspheme and blaspheme, just as the jurists, papists and all our adversaries take the knowledge of things from our writings and use the same weapons and weapons against us. But, praise be to God, our cause has a certain, good and lasting reason, namely, God and His Word. We also have fine martyrs over it, for M. Henricus became a martyr in faith for the faith in Ditmars, as did Leonhard Kaiser in Bavaria and the two boys in Brussels. 


12. the priests of the Jews, by which they lived and were fed. 


A beautiful fruit of good pears and peaches was brought forward. Martinus looked at them with diligence and said: "The priests of the Jews had a surplus of fruits from the decem and first fruits of all kinds, because our Lord God has well provided for the people. Although the twelve tribes were poor, because the people were numerous and the Jewish land was small, they had to give the firstfruits of all the grown fruits and animals, which were the priest's alone. The decem was common to both the priests and Levites, because 1) the Levites had to 


1) For that ----- except that. Binding rope 1, 465. 


give tithes from their goods to the priests. 

But the people did not give it to them gladly, but gave them the most fearful and unprofitable things, so that even the prophet Malachias and Haggaeus thundered and flashed against them, that they sacrificed lame and unprofitable cattle for the decem and firstfruits. But the people of Israel were a poor people, living meagerly; as it is written of David, when he dedicated the tabernacle, he made a great feast, giving to each person a roll, a cup of porridge, and a morsel of flesh. Now it is all done with eating and drinking and all the rest of the splendor. 


The Jews cannot hear Jesus called the crucified one. 


About two Jewish rabbis, Shamaria and Jacob, came to me, said Doctor Martin Luther, talked with me and asked me to give them letters of support. The same pleased them well, if only | had not put the Tola, that is, Jesus the Crucified, in it. For they cannot help it, they must blasoheme the name of Jesus; and they are exceedingly hostile to the little song "Christ is risen. One gets tired of all the songs with time, but that Christ is risen, one must sing again every year. 

Item: Another Jew said: "If so many thousands of innocent people have been killed, all of them are now silent; only Jesus, the crucified one, must always be remembered, whose death cannot be forgotten. 


14. powerful argument against the Jews. 


The Jews must be met with strong arguments. How this is, said D. M. Luther, Jer. 23, 5. 6. where he speaks of Christ, the offspring of David, "who shall be a righteous offspring, and a king, who shall rule well, and do justice and righteousness. In that day Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely. And this shall be his name, that they shall call him: LORD our righteousness. 

The Jews cannot solve this argument. And because they do not want this Christ- 


1580 


Cap. 74. Of the Jews. §14-18. 


1581 


They must give us another king from David, who shall!17, The destruction of Jerusalem is the most terrible and 


reign because the sun and the moon shine, as the prophets promised. 


15 Another Argument Against the Jews. 


Either God must be unjust, or you Jews must be wicked; for you have been in misery and outcast, cast out and driven away, longer than in the promised land. For the Jews have not been in the Promised Land for more than three hundred years, while Solomon's temple was still standing, and now they have been in misery and driven out for more than fifteen hundred years. Nor can they be comforted by the example of the Babylonian prisons, when the time was determined to be seventy years, and yet they were not without prophets, nor without rule; yea, they wrought and did more at Babylon than at Jerusalem. For Daniel was a greater and mightier ruler at Babylon than David and Solomon were at Jerusalem. Therefore the Babylonian prison was only a paternal rod. But this last punishment is the real end. 

They hope that we will join them, because we are now also dealing with the Ebrew language, and are teaching and learning it; but this is not to happen. They must accept our religion and the crucified Christ, and overcome all the troubles, especially that the Sabbath is postponed, which moves them very much and hits them hard in the head, and the apostles have arranged it this way, in honor of the resurrection of the Lord. 


16 The Jews think they can keep the law. 


The poor, blind, hardened Jews praise the righteousness of the Law, which they cannot keep; indeed, they blaspheme God with such zeal over the Law, which they are not to keep except in the Promised Land. 

Summa, the Jews cannot solve this argument, they have to leave it unbitten, because it strikes them down like thunder: namely, they have to show cause why they have been abandoned for more than fifteen hundred years, a people without regiment, without law, without prophets, without a temple. They can show no other cause than their sin. 


greatest wrath. 


The destruction of Jerusalem was cruel, miserable and terrible, so that all other monarchies and emperors falls and plagues, floods, Sodomae, Pharaonis 2c. are nothing compared to _ this devastation. For this city has been God's city, dwelling place, refuge and bed; as the Psalm says: "Here will | dwell, for | have chosen it" 2c., Ps. 132, 14. There was the law, priesthood, the temple, there is David, Solomon, Isaiah 2c., there are innumerable prophets buried; so that the Jews may well have defied such great privileges. 

What are we poor, wretched Gentiles and Rome against Jerusalem? Our God is not our prisoner. He has not yet drunk much Wittenberg and Torgau beer. Has he handed over the beautiful Jerusalem, which he had thus adorned with his word, law, blood friends 2c.: it will, verily, also apply to us. Truly, he will not give it to us either, we may judge ourselves by it. 

Summa: This destruction of Jerusalem is more horrible and terrible than all plagues on earth have ever been and will ever be. It was also too much that his own people should lead his own son out of the city and crucify him. 


18. the Jews' stubbornness and blasphemous praying. 


The Jews still do not want to listen today: although they have been disgraced for more than fifteen hundred years 1) and have been publicly condemned and decided, they still do not believe. It should break a man's heart when he sees the Jews so scattered that the blood of Jesus Christ 2) should almost burn everything in hell: they are scattered everywhere in the kingdom, according to their words, which they said to Pilate: "We have no king but Caesar" 2c., Joh. 19, 15. But they are a harmful people, they exhaust everything with usury: where they pay an authority a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders, they pay a thousand guilders.

The Christians, who need their medicine, of life andews can compare themselves much better with the property, because they think they are doing God alTurks than with the Christians; for Jews and Turks are service, if they only plague the Christians and kill them Ione, and confess that there is only One God, but they secretly.

Jews have had some excellent people. 


We love the people (the Jews), said D. M. Luther, and yet they are so hopeful and proud. Truly, this people has had excellent men, as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Daniel, Samuel, Paulum 2c. Who would not be sorry and grieved that such a great and glorious people should perish and be lost so miserably? The Latin Church has not had a more excellent man and teacher than Augustine, and the Church against tomorrow Athanasius; although he was nothing special. Therefore we are branches grafted into the right vine. The prophets call the Jews, but especially the line of Abraham, a beautiful little vine, and Christ himself had to come from such a beautiful plant. We Gentiles are no longer orthodox, righteous believers. Several of us are washers. 


(Here, 6 lines are omitted because transferred to Cap. 7, § 56, where they belong). 


24. this time ungodliness. 


Now we also do as the Jews do, as is evident; therefore God will also punish us. This is what happens to lost children who do not want to obey their parents; after that, they do not respect them either, and even make them blind. No one has ever written about it, and no one can write about it, because all good talk is too little, indeed nothing, to erase such a wrath of God. 

O heavenly Father, let us stay with the sun, and let us not fall from your word. But the Jews still do not listen, but continue to blaspheme. How they ravish the good handmaid Mariam: though she had been a Gentile, the Aenea Sylvia, it were too much and gross: she hath done nothing; yet do they blaspheme and ravish her. Behold, and consider what they have suffered these fifteen hundred years; what will it be in hell? There it will be much more miserable. There is no nation under the sun that is more wickedly dealt with and destroyed than the Jews. 


Cap. 74. Of the Jews. § 23-25. 


1585 


Do not tell a Jew that Christ is the true God, for he will not believe it. Therefore | do not dispute with any Jew. Rabbi Akibl 1) says: Messiah has come, but it would not be the Christ, but a star child, born from the star of Jacob 2c. This was also the reason why Jerusalem was besieged. All were under the delusion that Messiah had come; now they deny it. Then the Jews who came after them said that he was a lying child. Then they pretended that there were two of them, Joseph's son and David's son, and that none of them would be among the beggars until he was called God. The third, they dream that he will come, they are waiting for him. 

| believe that the present Jews are vain Epicureans, good fellows who have despaired of the Messiah. They believe that whoever does much good will be righteous; whoever hears Moses will be blessed. Messiah comes or does not come, they do not care; they say: Messiah will restore the law, not abolish it. They also think of a worldly kingdom that Messiah will establish. 


25: Of a baptized Jew who had been a dean in Cologne. 


Doctor Martin Luther said that in a church in Cologne there was a dean who had a cat in one hand and a mouse in the other. This deacon had been a Jew, and had been baptized and converted to Christianity: after his death he had himself hewn in stone on the church door, so that he might show how little the cat can be good to the mouse, so little is a Jew good to a Christian. And it is true, said D. M. Luther, the Jews do not grant us anything good, we are to them as death or as a burnt sorrow. It grieves them that we pass before their eyes. The Jews have no consolation, for only usury sustains them; but if | were a lord of the land, | would also forbid them usury.

He wanted to go and see the supreme head of Christianity before he was baptized, which the priest tried hard to prevent, because he feared that if he saw the trouble and evil in Rome, he would be deterred from Christianity. But the Jew went to Rome, and when he had seen enough horrible things, he came again to the priest and asked for baptism, saying: "Now | will gladly worship the Christian God, for he is patient enough: if he can suffer such evil and wickedness at Rome, he can also suffer all the wickedness and badness of the world; but God is not cruel enough that he has afflicted us, his people, so much. 

According to this history, he, M. Luther, thought about how Rome was situated, which he had passed through and seen with great danger for fourteen days, and the same place, the old Rome, where the best and most beautiful buildings would have been, would have been razed by the Goths and made equal and even to the earth. On the mountain and castle, the Capitolio, would have been a barefoot monastery, and the mountain, called Tarpeius, was higher than the Aventine mountain, Capitolinus and Quirinalis. 1) The theater and playhouse would be built round, fifteen steps high in the round around raised above each other, so that one could sit and watch in layers, in two hundred thousand people: of which stand-

The walls and the foundation still exist. After that, there would be a churchyard of St. Calixtus, where several thousand martyrs would be buried. 


38. Jews Argument. 


Jews and Turks have one argument, that is: Cursed are all those who worship more than one God: Christians do that, therefore they are cursed. The minor and other propositions, they say, are proven by this, because they believe in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit 2c.

A Christian never holds on to his Christ as firmly as a Jew or even a fanatic holds on to his doctrine. For even though a Christian sticks to his doctrine even unto death, he often stumbles and begins to doubt. But this is not the case with the enthusiasts, who stand firm and hold stiffly over their enthusiasm; as Marcus of Zwickau, the devil-prophet, did. | said to him, "He should take care that he does not go astray. Then he said: God shall not bring me from this. 2c.

(The following two paragraphs Cordatus No. 1599 and 1600.) 


The power of the Turk is very great because he receives twice a hundred thousand soldiers at his expense throughout the year, but his rule is nothing but pure wickedness. We, however, are tender martyrs who are unable to do anything because we are oppressed by different rulers. One corrupts the other. We wanted 2) to resist the Turk with the Lord's Prayer, for it is written: Deliver us from evil, if Germany had not shed so much blood and, on top of that, not pursued the recognized truth. Therefore God will look for us at home. 

God will punish us as He once punished Sodom and Gomorrah, Seboim, the five cities, because of pride. After that, he will raise up an Abraham, who will punish the four kings again. So if | were to be God's counselor, if He wanted to punish Germany, | would advise that when it was punished by the Turk, He [God] also punished it afterwards by some bad boy and struck it to the ground. But God will do it.

(The following paragraph Cordatus No. 895.) 


God recently chased the Turk from Vienna. Since everything was available in the imperial army, he had to buy the bread, which was sold for four pennies, for one guilder. 


(The following two paragraphs Cordatus No. 944 and 943.) 


The Turk is not a prince, but a robber who devastates everything that even a bad (simple) nobleman could. He swears and lies, both for his benefit. 

Hungary should fight the Spaniards, also Germany, which is prouder than it deserves. Hungary has fallen away from the faith twice; if it deviates for the third time, it will not return. 

The Turks are very proud and hopeful of their great fortune and victory; they devoured the Saracens thirty years ago when the Sultan perished. They think that they alone are God's people; they say that Abraham sacrificed Ishmael, not Isaac; they’ are Ishmael's seed, 3) to whom the kingdom on earth belongs, as to whom it is promised and promised: they call us idolaters for the sake of the article of the Holy Trinity: They also say that there is only one God, that Jesus Christ sits at the left hand, but Mahomet sits at the right hand: Christ's law and doctrine would be too difficult and impossible, therefore Mahomet has given others, which are easier and more painful, as the evil lusts and desires do not condemn so much. But they keep their worship very strict and stiff with praying, fasting, think much of Christ, honor the mountain Oreb, but they do not want to build Jerusalem again. 

Anno 1536, Dec. 21, Margrave George of Brandenburg came to Wittenberg to D. M. Luther. M. Luthern and told of the miserable and horrible battle that the Turk had conquered against our people, how the best and nucleus of the selected warriors had been betrayed and slain, sixty captains had been captured and led away with great triumph and joy.

would have been. The poor Christians would have been shamefully tormented and their noses would have been cut out, which scorn and mockery has never been experienced. Then said D. M. Luther said: "It is true for us Germans, God's wrath is at the door: we may repent, because the time of salvation is still here: we struggle for misfortune, which must also befall us. 

Dear, look at the great venomous hatred of the papists against the gospel, who relied on the emperor and have often been disgraced; they still do not turn back. In Augsburg, at the Imperial Diet of 1530, they cried out in all certainty: "The Savior is coming. Count Ernst von M[ansfeld] built a bonfire the night he heard that the emperor had come to Germany. 

So that priest at Eisenach bet all his cows that Luther should be put to shame before Michaelmas with all his own. For several years we hoped for the emperor's victory, if he would erect his shield in Paris, it should go over the Lutherans. So now, in the Court of Appeal, they have deliberated about those of Augsburg, who have been banished; after that, the eight should follow about the Lutherans. 

Now they are again comforted by the fact that the French have come against the emperor with a large group of warriors. Italy has fallen away. The Turk invades Germany. This means: "He scatters those who are confident in their hearts", Luc. 1,51. Oh dear God, can you do this? Summa, they have been exceedingly presumptuous. H[archduke] G[eorg] 1) is the ignition powder of all misfortune, he shall have a great treasure; although the cities also have money. If the landgrave raises something, it will not remain with the plunder, as before, when the bishop of M[ainz] 2) had to give ten times a hundred thousand guilders in plunder. 

The Turkish emperor sits in great majesty, has three forecourts. In front of the first, twelve lions are tied to chains, in front of the other, panther beasts. He has money and people, armor, provisions, and such a people, who with

He is pressed into servitude, must do everything as he wants, like serfs. In a hundred years, he has increased magnificently, gradually and one by one suppressing and conquering the Saracens, who were previously lords in Syria, Asia, Jerusalem, the Promised Land, Africa and Greece. 

So God plays with great kings, as Isaiah says: "I, the Lord, am a strong God over kingdoms; whichever sins, | destroy. This he has well proved. For first he devastated Nineveh and Affur, the Chaldean kingdom; then Babylon devoured Nineveh: the same devoured Assyria. When the Persians thought that they were dead, the great Alexander came and conquered it. Alexander was then destroyed by the Romans. The Roman Empire, which had been the most powerful, was eaten up by internal wars of Saracens, Goths, Wends and Huns. Thus our Lord God can pay the great monarchs, emperors, kings and princes. The Venetians have never done anything worthy, they are not warriors, but only pepper sacks. 

Let it be equal that the Turk in a short time, namely a hundred years, has had luck and victory and has risen high; but it is nowhere to be compared with the Roman Empire, which in fifty years has increased and grown exceedingly, so that it has been the most powerful. It had endured a great paroxysm and shock from Hannibal, the supreme commander of Carthage, for three and twenty years, but after that it hastily increased and grew again, so that Scipio, the excellent hero, said: "One should not ask in litanies for increase and expansion of the empire; as if he wanted to say: "Seek no more expansion and greater; see how you may maintain this great. 

So now | also hope that the world is at the end. For Carolus and Solimannus are the yeasts of the empire; no one will possess the empire completely. The Turk has not yet made it as far as the Roman Empire, which rose very high and increased in fifty years. It will probably remain with these yeasts. Christ will come, for we have no more Scripture, and the signs are there. 

While the Turk has great luck and succes-

sion, and all of them still boast that they come from the trunk and flower of the Ottomanni: therefore they are proud, puffed up and triumphant, since the Roman emperors have never had such a line. For Emperor Julius left no male heir, Augustus-Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius succeeded him only by women and held the empire. But the Turk has his male line and lineage from Ottomanno. The Germans are Roman emperors and kings per synecdoche, only with the title; however, the Pope occupies Italy and Anders. 

The Ch[urfiirst] 1) told Doctor Martin Luthern of a great loss, which our war people in Hungary should have taken from the Turk, among the three highest captains, K., V. and S., 2) who should have been corrumped by the Turk: for it would be written at Vienna at all churches, K., V. and the S. were worthy to be hanged by a rope, for they had led the German army, which was not sufficiently armed, to the Turkish camp; but when a Christian, who had escaped from the Turkish troop and had run away, came and told them to get ready and make the battle order, for the enemy was armed, the captains were sure to despise it: After that, when they saw that the enemy was coming, they secretly turned away and fled, leaving the foot soldiers, who could not flee because the enemy was too close on their necks, standing: The latter were frightened and cried out miserably, partly wounding themselves as much as they could, so that the Turk gave flight, which made ours hearty again, so that they stood still, so that among the foot soldiers eleven hundred and twenty men were in the battle, all of whom had been miserably slain. 3)

The Turks, who rise so mightily with tyranny, shall suddenly fall, only that God punishes our wickedness through such tyrants, as we also honestly strive for. 

Turks presumptuously think they have the right worship and religion, ridicule and mock our Christian religion, using this saying John 5:43, where Christ says, "| am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him will ye receive." On the (alius, other) they rest. 

(The following two paragraphs in Lauterbach, 17 Feb. 1538, 

p. 32.) 

Luther spoke to the mayors of Wittenberg about the great disloyalty and treachery of Catianus, who had received gold from the Turk through a Jew, 18,000 ducats, and had promised that he would also betray the king himself, and said with a sigh: Auri sacra fames, quid non mortalia pectora cogis ?

[Cursed hunger for gold, why don't you bring a human heart?] He must burn eternally in hell, that traitor. | would not betray a little dog. | fear another misfortune from Ferdinand, who let such a large army fall into the Turk's jaws. He entrusted such a large nation to that faithless man, who first fell away from the Turk to the Christians, and perhaps has now fallen away from the Christians again. Ah, princes and rulers should be differently skilled against the so great power of the Turk. They should go to the field themselves and not oppose him with such a small army. For the Turk is not a small enemy, as Daniel [7:21] writes: "It is given unto him to fight against the saints." That is why he has such great successes, victory, even appearance of godliness, that he mocks us Christians as idolaters. He makes three thrones: God, on the left Christ, on the right Mahomet, who took the kingdom of Christ, who preceded him. Therefore, the Turk's oaths are with GOD, the Creator of heaven and earth, with Mahomet, his servant, and with the eighty-four prophets sent from heaven.

| do not believe when necessity demands it, as it is written in Aesop that the wolf was to be beaten when he was not there, but after that, when he came, no one wanted to come. | am very much afraid that Germany will be ruined when it is exhausted in money and men, and then it will be thrown to the Turks.

That is why | have often thrown the keys to the door of God. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 160.) 


On November 10, he said various things about the lies of the Turks, who brazenly boasted as Saracen and God's people, with the most brazen lie against the Holy Scriptures. They say that it is true that Isaac was the son of the promise, but when he should have been slaughtered on Mount Horeb, he escaped from his father's obedience, as if he wanted to get the knife himself. Meanwhile, Ishmael would have offered himself voluntarily for sacrifice, and so he would have become the son of promise. This lie is very impudent, as is that of the Papists of One Form. It is not a sin of ignorance, but of obduracy. Thus, the Turk boasts that he is God's people and the most religious, as if all others were idolaters. 


(This paragraph in Cordatus No. 341.) 


When the Turk will come to Germany, he will give us a good [slap]. But he will never possess Germany, because the people are too evil. 

If the Turk comes, he will not be provoked by Ferdinand, but by himself, so that he will provoke us and give us cause to fight and defend ourselves. But it is said that he who takes the sword will be beaten and will gladly lose. But | take care. For among our people there is great contempt for God's word, and among the papists great blasphemy and abominable sin against the first and other tablets of God's ten commandments; this makes me evil in conscience and grieves my heart.

Cap. 75. Of the Turk. § 1.

Again, first of all, | am comforted by the Turk's hope, who relies on his power, and by F[erdinanda's] poverty. For the nature and manner of our Lord God is to remove the mighty from the throne. On the other hand, that the Pope and the Frenchman lure the Turk into our land. Therefore, God help us. If he comes in a moment, he may lead Sebnam away, but he will have to leave Ezechiam satisfied. 


(The following paragraph in Lauterbach, Nov. 10, 1538, p. 161.)- 


The first and most important of the Turk's languages is the Scythian, which he uses at court and for writing letters; then the Arabic, because of religion, since Mahomet wrote in Arabic. The third and fourth languages are Greek and Latin, which are foreign [barbarae] to them. He is the only ruler of a large part of Asia, except for the Persian kingdom, Egypt, Greece and all the countries that belong to the Oriental empire. | hope he will leave the occidental one satisfied. If he should come to Germany, he will not come as a lord, but as a robber. If Germany had a master, she could easily resist him, but the Papists, our worst enemies, would rather see Germany ruined. The Turk is in the mood for this, he is skilled in warfare, is always in arms; if he is put to flight in one place, he tries it in another and tires his opponents. 

Turks have kept many Mosaic things and ceremonies; but the great fortune in wars and victories makes them proud and inflates them, that they have invented new services. For the fame and glory of war is greatly esteemed according to the flesh. Therefore, because the Turk knows nothing of the weakness and lack of stature of the Lord Christ, he is hopeful and proud; as Daniel also says, "It is given unto him to fight against the saints, and to overcome them." Dan. 7, 21. Revelation 13, 7. 

In 1539, on February 11, it was said that the Turk had defeated the Wallachians and that he was heading for Germany through Poland 2c. There spoke D. M. Luther: He desires Germany, that is even, especially of the place. To Italy 


1604 Cap. 75: Of the Turk. §1. But he does not fight easily, because he does not have enough space, he is too close to his people. He is a cruel, fierce enemy, and not to be despised: is very powerful, capable of many people: is a well- practiced and tried warrior, very wise: prevails and overcomes with artificial attacks and counsel: spares his people: keeps his people in favor and in good will; does not go out into the field thoughtlessly, does not strike either, 1) for he sees his advantage, breaks off the enemies gradually, plucks and plucks them one by one. He is indeed a great calamity, God's distemper and rod. We are sure and hopeful, and despise him: we rely on our wisdom, as if we were at war against the king of England or France; since he is a lord over many kingdoms, lands and people, and the most powerful and mighty monarch and emperor: and if a Michael or Raphael did not stand for us, be with us and defend him, we would have long perished. 

D. Luther complained about Emperor Carl's negligence, as he did not take the matter seriously, always letting the Turks take one after the other, since an emperor should not have peace. As can be seen in histories, the Romans have always considered themselves a hereditary and certain warrior people, who always lay in the field, just as today the Turk also has the Jenitsher, 2) tried and best warriors. We, however, gather a bunch of loose, daring, wicked boys, who also damage and kill those who should protect and shield them. God protect us from war and war cries. 

But | am extremely afraid of the Papists' alliance with the Turk, that they want to go to ruins with us. God grant that my prophecy may fail. | see the antecedents that precede; God will graciously prevent the consequences and what may follow. If the papists think of such a thing, they may do it. For it is unbelievable how evil the devil is: he does not rest and does not celebrate. They are now disgraced.

and have despaired, will make another, and remember how they have betrayed and surrendered us to the Turk, who holds almost the whole oriental empire, and all that lies to the east, except Syria, Babylon, Mesopotamia, which are under the Persian king: as the Persian Sultan and the Turk have One Religion, and yet one plagues the other for regiment's sake, that each would gladly have all, and be a lord alone, like ours. 

In 1539, the last of June, there were new reports about the Persian king, how he was harassing the Turks and harassing them with wars, so that he would have had to call off his warriors from Wallachia. Then D. M. Luther was very surprised at the great power and might of Persia, which could humiliate the Turk and break him off in such a way that there would have to be two great powers. For although the Turk is capable of a great nation and is industrious, persevering forever and ever, and does not slacken nor celebrate, yet the Persian is said to have said that the Turk comes with many wives, wanting to bring him men 2c. It seems that the Turk is very afraid of the Persian. 

Oh, if we Germans were also loyal to one another, we could easily resist the Turk if we always had fifty thousand on foot and ten thousand on horseback in the field. And since a battle would be lost, it could be replaced and reinstated with fresh troops from the start; it should be resisted and increased. 

Duke Albrecht of Saxony is said to have said: If he had fifty thousand well-armed and skilled warriors with him, he would crisscross the world. Thus the Romans always had a warrior people with them, with whom they always held their ground and conquered their enemies. For they annually paid two and forty legions or regiments; and one legion had six thousand men. With the addition they made the people weary; so also the warrior people become more skillful and more ready through constant practice. Therefore, righteous warriors have special privileges and freedoms above others. 

The Gospel is to Oven, in Hungary, and in Greece in many places. It is

But, said D. M. Luther, this is a very cunning and that [it] means won. 2) God is pleased to fight with such 


dangerous plot by the Turk against the Roman Empire, so that he can lure people to him and smear their mouths. But we want to pray to God that he will put his practices and treachery to shame, so that when he thinks he wants to bring us into his net, God will convert him through righteous, pious, godly preachers, as happened to Babel through dear Daniel. 

Anno six hundred and thirty Mahomet arose, therefore this year (since 1530 1) is written nine hundred years. 

Now certain newspapers say that the Turk is coming. Now the papists will say that he is coming for the sake of my teachings, so that God will punish Germany for not destroying Luther and his teachings. After that, Master Faber, Schmid, Rotzléffel and others will make processions and prayers. What shall our God do to him? | would like to beat the Turk, but | don't know how to pray, our people are so bad about it. May the Almighty God have mercy on us and help us. | am afraid that M. will lose the land. Well, they don't want it any other way. | fear that | have been a prophet, for | have said that the Emperor was required and appointed in Germany for the sake of exterminating the Lutherans by force, but if he did not do so, he and all of us would be thrown into the Turks’ jaws.

(The following in Cordatus No. 686. 1612. 1613.) 


One talks a lot about the Turk and the German princes, who believe they will also succeed because they have the intention. But God says: Both is mine [namely, the will and the accomplishment]. The world will learn this from Ferdinand and Duke George. Thus the Turk advances against us very presumptuously and very surely, with contempt for all conditions of peace, trusting only in the quantity of his army. It wants to king

ompanions, which he proved before Vienna, from here the Turk departed with shame and lost many housands of people in the Danube and through the lague. He will destroy him with hellish fire. When the urk has overrun us, he will fly out. 

When the emperor broke out with a very large rmy against the Turk to Austria, he [Luther] said that e believes that Daniel speaks of him in the 11th hapter [v. 45], where he speaks of the king at midnight nd at noon [Austri], who will pitch his tent between wo seas in the precious land. God help us that good ew newspapers come. | would not have believed that should have lived so long until the two emperors hould come together. 3) 

Pray to God, because our leader [princeps] is too resumptuous and trusts in his armies. This will not nd well. He also added this, that the horses of the ermans of the Turks easily knock over clover. 


2. admonition of D. M. Luther, how to fight against the Turk. 

(From a sentence of Luther's letter to the Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, May 17, 1542, Walch, old edition, Vol. XXI, 470, the first paragraph of this § is formed, which we have omitted, namely: "For Turks and devils, our sin and God's wrath are four mighty, great enemies, so on our necks lie, to which we are with bodily power much, much too weak.") 


When the young lord, Duke John Frederick, took he homage at Wittenberg, in 1532, new newspapers ame, saying that some captured Turks had indicated hat the Turk was leading two hundred thousand arriors, wanted to wait for the emperor and do battle ith him. Our emperor, however, would meet him with ne and a half hundred thousand men, namely, six and orty thousand Spaniards and Italians. And Antoni de eva,

3) There is talk of the campaign in the fall of 1532 that Emperor arl V undertook with his own troops and the imperial army against he Turks. (Wrampelmeyer.) 


1608 Cap. 75. Of the Turk. § 2. 1609 


the famous warrior and most distinguished one among the emperor's captains, would have arrived with a very large and select band of warriors, in fifty thousand men by sea. 

Then M. Luther said: "All this is according to my wish. For we see that the world is now governed by God's counsel, and if he gives happiness, not by human wisdom. Who could have hoped that such a great people and army would come together? This happens unawares. Thus, this time of the world is now governed by unspeakable, miraculous ways and measures. We have, praise God, such an emperor, who now brings together the two most powerful and strongest nations, Spaniards and Germans, and has them with each other. May God the Lord give him victory, and every Christian is obliged to pray diligently that he may prosper and have happiness. For he is given to us by God, and he has ruled well until now. Therefore, pray that God will help him, assist him, and send an angel to his army, so that the Turk will be frightened enough. If he defeats the Turk, he shall advise the other adversaries well. For the Pope, the King of France, England, and the Venetians are enemies of our Emperor, seek his crown, and would like to subdue him; therefore he is in great need of the prayers of the faithful. God will help him, because he is righteous and sincere, not bloodthirsty. 

(Cordatus No. 666.) 

Whoever twitches the knife first, must also take it first. Thus the Turk has so far, since he was provoked by Ferdinand, [won, when he will come uugereizt,] 2) he will be defeated and will be defeated, and when the papists will start war against us, they will be defeated. In short, he who twitches to the last, tucks in to the last. 

(One paragraph, in Lauterbach, Jan. 5, 1538, p. 3, is 

transferred to Cap. 62, §1, where it belongs; instead, we let follow here the relation of Cordatus No. 882). 

The King of France has been so long proud, relying 

on auxiliaries from the Turk, that at last in his glorious

He was captured and put in prison, so that he would learn that defeat and victory are in God's hands. This was not known to Signor Bartholomew, the captain of the Venetians, who had chased 4,000 of Maximilian's soldiers into a valley and said: "Those Germans | will slaughter before the eyes of all the gods, and he has fallen with his great army. He said, be it dear or sorry to God. But behold the war of God. For when the Venetians fled into the valley, their powder chariot broke and the powder scattered here and there was finally set on fire by them and began to kill the pursuing Venetians, but then the Venetians turned around and killed them all, with a very large number of the most respected women, who were invited in their adornment by the captain from Padua and arid cities to watch him slaughter the German beasts. 

The Turk boasts of his great fortune and victory, as if he alone with his Mahometists were God's people, and completely believes that he alone is emperor and lord of the world, just as only One is God and creator. But the boast is untimely, because the Roman Empire, which was the most powerful, never had the whole world under its control. For it could not force the Persians, Parthians, India, Germany and bring them under its power. The teacher Baldus disputes whether the emperor is a lord of the whole world? But there is no need for proof, because the work also proves it. 

There was talk about the Turks that Emperor Carl had sent 18,000 Spaniards to Austria to protect it. Then M. Luther sighed and said: "Oh, these are the last times and days, when these cruel nations, namely Turks and Spaniards, want to rule: | would rather have the Turk as an enemy than the Spaniards as patrons, who tyrannize to the utmost. The majority are Marans, 3) baptized Jews, who believe nothing at all, since other heretics stubbornly defend their Opinions: but the Marans are good fellows, who still believe nothing certain.

On (Wednesday), April 3, Luther and Philip made a trip to Torgau. There they talked about many things. Philippus praised the description of the world [cosmographiam] by Cornelius Tacitus, who is said to have lived in the times of Emperor Caligula. He would have described Germany with wonderful praise because of its constancy and faithfulness, especially because of its chastity and marital fidelity, in which it excelled above all nations. But, unfortunately, now in the last times the so highly praised people degenerated. No one doubts that the best age was before the Flood, when the extremely long-lived people lived modestly, without intoxication and wars and discord, and only served God and man and took good care of God's creatures in heaven and on earth. A fresh fountain was more sweet to them than even all malmsey wines. And after that, he greatly cursed drunkenness and revelry.

Germany is a very good country, has everything enough that one should have, to maintain this life abundantly. It has all kinds of fruit, grain, wine, corn, salt, mines, and everything else that grows and comes from the earth; only that we do not respect it, nor do we use it properly, as we should, in honor of God and for the benefit of our neighbor, and thank Him for it; yes, we abuse it most shamefully, much worse than the swine. God gives all things mildly and abundantly, so that no one has anything to complain about, and demands nothing else from us, except that we be obedient to Him and say Deo gratias.

4. Germany is finished. by robbing them of their goods. This and similar things (Lauterbach, Jan. 15, Tuesday, 1538, p. 10.) are a preparation for the future slaughter by the Turk or by the emperor. For we must do as little good to the emperor as to the Turk. Philip said: "It is a very old prophecy that the king of France will be killed before Strasbourg. 2c. And is similar to the truth. For this city lies in the first approach. It is a fortress, which the Emperor and the French will attack first, as an example to others. Luther: Dear God! How godless is the world and how horrible these times, of which Paul says, where there is no hope of repentance, as Christ says: "When the Son of Man comes" 2c. Oh, who would have died! 


On January 15, Luther dined at the home of Hieran. Krappe with other doctors. There was much talk about the peace between the Emperor, the French, the Pope and the Venetians, but there was no mention of a future concilium. Luther answered: "They do not want a concilium at all, but they will condemn us without a concilium and persecute us as heretics.

It was thought of the change with clothes and other adornment, so annually is made and happens. Then said D. M. Luther said: "The change of clothes will also bring a change of regiments and manners. Unfortunately, we struggle too much for it.

16. from Erfurt. (The first paragraph transfers to Cap. 67, § 2, where it belongs). (This paragraph in Lauterbach, Dec. 1, 1538, p. 185.) 


It was mentioned that Erfurt would have been a very fertile Bethlehem, but the fields were so spoiled by the woad that the blessing turned into a curse. The thalers are so good for the farmers. God will give them thalers and will take away the grain and famine will follow. 

Thuringia has a black, slimy soil, which makes it difficult for carters to drive when it has rained and is wet, and the road is bad. In the West and in the Netherlands, the soil is watery, but there are good fields, delicious cattle that give good milk in quantity. That wants to have good, brave and industrious servants, who wait well, not be sleepy, because the milkers should sing, so that they do not sleep and spoil the cows. 

Thuringia was once a very fertile land, but now it is in extreme decline, perhaps because of the great avarice of the farmers. Our sandy little land here still has the blessing of being far superior and more fertile. It is a divine miracle. God would gladly give us all enough, if we did not misuse his gifts so shamefully and spoil them with our avarice.

Anno 1538, den 8. Decembris, came a pious, honest matron of nobility, a very long woman, to D. M. Luther of Magdeburg, with her daughter, who was also the length of her mother, and her son, who was longer than M. Antonius Lauterbach, the deacon at Wittenberg, who was a very long man. Then said D. M. Luther said: "Here is an example of the German bodies, which in former times were like giants, but now we are like pygmies and dwarfs compared to them.

18. from Jerusalem. When the temple at Jerusalem was burned. 


On the day of Laurentii, August 10, the temple in Jerusalem was burned. After that, on the day of Nativity, September 8, the other inner and strongest part of the city was destroyed and taken. 


19. from the destruction of Jerusalem. 


Since Jerusalem is the most glorious city from which the Scriptures and the beginning of the Christian Church come, we are presented with an example of how the Christian Church will be, for the Christian Church is the spiritual Jerusalem in which God still walks daily. 

The prophet says: | will send plagues upon you: 1) Pestilence, that is, death. 2) Famine, that is, theurung. 3) Sword, that is, war. 4) Evil beasts, that is, sedition. And with all these Jerusalem is destroyed. For there were three captains and parties against each other. And in the same way Christianity is destroyed in our time by the pope, false Christians and prophets, false saints and teachers. For Christ is called an anointed one, for they 1) have anointed and crowned their kings. 

But Christ is anointed with the Holy Spirit, therefore we are also Christians, because we are anointed with Him and together with Him we are anointed with the Holy Spirit of God. A prophet, however, is a teacher who dares to instruct the people about things to come. For so also the heathen poets or teachers taught: If you will be pious, it will go well with you; but if you will not be pious, it will not go well with you all your life 2c. And have come no further. 

But in Christendom the prophets teach of the future life and blessedness and of eternal damnation. So now the pope is the false prophet and teacher with his rebellious teaching: for no order agrees with the other, and yet they are all radically against Christ. For he has baptized

This Then it is seen that unbelief is the root and origin s the right description of our land. In such places, God of all sins; again, faith is the root of all good works. For PPPEAats. if the faith of the pope had been right, he would not have committed so many errors, sins and doctrines that are contrary to God. Just as the faith of Jerusalem was restored in the time of the Maccabees, so the gospel will also come forth again (praise God). But now the last day will put an end to the game, just as in Jerusalem the word of God through the Lord Christ, John the Baptist, started again, and after forty years it fell; as a fire suddenly burns up in a thorn bush, and after that it goes out again in a hay, like a straw wipe. 











21. from England. 


| believe that England is a piece of Germany, ecause they need the Saxon language, as in estphalia and the Netherlands; although it is very orrumpirt. | think that the Germans have been ransferred and placed there for a long time, as even oday the bishop of Cologne writes himself Duke of ngland, where Bremen and Hamburg are located: at irst it is called Britannia, then Angera, from the people ho have been transferred there. The Danish and nglish languages are Saxon, which is quite German. he Upper German language is not the right German anguage, takes the mouth full and wide, and reads ard. But the Saxon language goes off finely softly and asily. 

Germany has various dialectos, ways of speaking, o that people thirty miles away cannot understand ach other well. The Austrians and the Bavarians do ot understand the Thuringians and the Saxons, 


20. from cities. 


On November 1, 1538, Luther talked with Georg von Minkwitz, knight, a lot about the change of the regiments, and said that at the time of Emperor Sigismund Saxony had been a poor little country; therefore the Emperor asked that Meissen and Thuringia be added to it, and thus become a Churfirstenthum. The princes of Lauenburg held specially the Dutch. Yes, jutha, ju, ke, ha, such Saxony at that time. Thus the three lands were hyerjahen" is of many kinds, and one is different from brought together and became one. If they were still lie ‘other.

22. from swabia and bavaria. 


If |, said D. Luther said, "If | were to travel a lot, | would not prefer to go anywhere but through Swabia and Bavaria, because they are friendly and kind, they like to offer lodgings, they accommodate strangers and travelers, and they do good and kind things for people's money. Hesse and Meissen follow suit to some extent, but they take their money well for it. Saxony is very unfriendly and rude, since they neither give good words nor food; they say: "Dear guest, | don't know what | should give you to eat, the wif is not at home, | can't accommodate you. You see here in Wittenberg how unkind the people are, asking neither for respectability and politeness, nor for religion, for no citizen lets his son study, since they see a great example and number of foreign students and guests. Oh, the country does not bear it. 


23. from the swiss country. 


Switzerland is an arid and mountainous country, therefore they are endelich and hurtig, must look for their food elsewhere: about it also the quarrel arose that one did not let them supply provisions. | hear they will grow together again. 


(The following at Cordatus No. 1112. 611 and 581.) 


Only GOD can boast of the title of truth, therefore He says [Hos. 11, 9.], "| am GOD and not a man," that is, | do not change, but [Ps. 116, 11.], "All men are liars." And GOD repents not [fetwas], but men very often. 

The Swiss argument is: He who has a just cause can justly start war; we have a just cause, therefore we will start war. Both, the upper proposition and the lower proposition, 1) are false and doubtful. For the supersentence does not admit of wars, but only of defense; but the subsentence is a doubtful saying, viz, 


1) Major and Minor. 


Cap. 76. of lands and cities. 


§ 21-24. 1625 


whether you have a righteous cause or not, a doubtful conclusion naturally follows. In short, those who say we want to avenge trust in human powers, but the pious trust in God [Matth. 18, 20]: "Where two or three" 2c. Thus everything goes well, and therefore everything goes back to the papists, because they do not trust in the true God, but in the emperor. Let us only pray, otherwise we cannot vex the devil except by this only way of prayer. Our Lord God is a pious man, therefore he must always be remembered. 

When | mention the dialects of Germany, | prefer the Hessian language to all, because they pronounce all words with expression and euphony. The Austrians do not use diphthongs, even the Franks speak with a monotone voice. 2) 

The lanquage of the Hessians. The Doctor praised the language of the Hessians above all other German dialects, because they pronounced the words with expression and euphony [accentibus et canendo] The Austrians did not preserve diphthongs, the Franks spoke with a monotonous and coarse voice. 


The difference between the languages. (Lauterbach, Sept. 19, 1538, p. 133 f.) 


On September 19, he said various things about the peoples of Germany, all of whom were simpler and more devoted to the truth than the French, Italians, Spaniards, and English, which even the manner of speech indicates, since they pronounce very clumsily, with a hiss and a lisping tongue. That is why it is said of the French that they speak differently than they write; indeed, they speak differently than they mean in their hearts. The German language, however, is the most perfect of all languages; 3) it has much in common with the Greek language. For the Latin language is very small and thin, not regular, because it has no double sounds, not even 0, y, ¢ 0. The Greek language has this in a fine way, and the German language also imitates this.

On November 14, there was much talk about the nature of Italian air, which would be very fine,

1628 


so that they closed all windows and gaps at night, because the night air would be harmful. Luther said: "This happened to me and my brother in Italy, that we lay all night with the window open in a very deep, heavy sleep until the sixth hour; but when we awoke, our heads were taken, so that we could walk only one mile the whole day, were tormented by great thirst and, since we had the greatest disgust for wine, desired only to drink water (which is deadly). At last we were restored by two pomegranates; thus God preserved us alive, by this very good fruit. An Englishman added that in England pestilential diseases are always present and never cease. Basil then said that the air of France was not at all beneficial and did not agree with the German, but, he said, the French could resist it because they were more temperate. They each drank from their own glass, and only two or three couples danced at a time, while the others watched. 

The Italians despise and condemn other nations, since they are an abomination before God, godless and hopeful. Their fasting is more apparent and better than our most glorious meals. Their clothing is delicious, they keep themselves clean: if we wear a cubit of velvet for a florin, they wear a cubit for six florins. Their chastity is like that of Sodom: the fact proves it and testifies to it. They are given into a wrong sense, because they do not respect marriage, which is natural and divine right, and even forbid it. They should also have forbidden throwing. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, 18 Dec. 1538, p. 193.) 


The Italians are unsociable, no one trusts the other to speak freely, as we Germans do, so no stranger is allowed a _ public conversation with his wife. Compared to the Germans, they are hermits. 


(This paragraph Cordatus No. 539.) 


The wicked ridicule us because we believe everything in the Scriptures. Pope Clement says that Christ is false because he is a virgin,

who gives birth is a loose woman, this is the faith of the Whales from the Scriptures. And they say: If we should trust in God alone, we would be the poorest people and could never become happy. They also say this: Conscience is an evil beast, because it makes man stand against himself. (Here 9 lines are omitted because contained in Cap. 27, § 119. - Cf. also Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. I, Col. 1243, § 109.) 


Italy is a very fertile, good and funny country, especially Lombardia is a valley twenty German miles wide, in the middle of it flows the Eridanus, evena very funny water, as wide as from Wittenberg to Brate is, on both sides are the Alpes and Apenninus mountains. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Jan. 29, 1538, p. 16.) 


The blindness and superstition of the Italians is great, because they fear St. Anthony and St. Sebastian more than Christ, because of the plagues. Therefore, if someone wants to preserve a place so that it is not polluted in the Italian way, as by dogs, he would have the image of St. Anthony with the fiery lance painted on it; this image would drive away all those who wanted to piss. In short, Italy is nothing but superstition, because without God's word and preaching, they live only in superstition, and thus believe neither in a resurrection of the flesh, nor in eternal life. They fear only physical plagues and misfortunes, so they are more afraid of St. Anthony and St. Sebastian than of Christ, who would be a friendly and kind brother to them. 

M. Melanchthon complained that the Serveti's error in Italy had great coincidence, spreading much harmful delusion about the Holy Trinity, denying the verbum caro factum est, the Word has become flesh. Then spoke D. M. Luther said: "Italy is full of very great, very harmful opinions and errors: if such errors come there, terrible abominations will arise there. We Germans and other nations are like a mere blackboard; but the whales are the blackboard, on which are painted many false opinions, which one cannot easily let go, and are skilled to accept much worse ones.

Italians are great fierce zealots, do not let their wives go out unveiled, nor with uncovered faces: only on St. Gregory's Day, once a year, they have privilege and freedom to go out, then they go to all the churches, and rejoice in their freedom. 

After that, they said that the chaplains in Italy and Gaul were unlearned donkeys who did _ not understand Latin well and had not learned their native language in Italy, yet they were supposed to preside over others and teach them. 


27. from the roman empire. 


The Roman Empire began to become rich and to increase at the time of the Apostles. Then 1) 750 years ago it came under Carolo Magno to the Germans. For Carolus had three sons, among whom he divided Germany, France and Italy. But Germania, the German, remained emperor. If the emperor now had France and Germany in his possession, he would have money and people, and he could probably arouse the Turk's wrath. 


(This paragraph in Lauterbach, Nov. 20, 1538, p. 176.) 


The Roman Empire did not last long in bloom, they did not have it for two hundred years, after that it came to France. Finally, it has come entirely to the Germans, who have had the Roman Empire, as far as the title is concerned, always in succession over eight hundred years. 

Christoph GroB said a lot about Spaniards and Italians, because he had long been the Pope's assistant in Rome, who had helped him on the chair. And if a pope died, then everything would be at a price, so that even the straw in the bed would not remain. There is such a robbery among the whales, whoever is able to rob the other puts him in sackcloth. 

After that he said about the countries, so one goes to the holy country, about Arragonia and

They put all their wine in goat skins and turn the rough stuff inside so that the hair floats inside. The women cover their heads with sheepskins and sweep out the rough: and the more stains, marks and trickles they have under their faces, the more honest and noble they are kept: they have a little scarlet on their noses, hard under their eyes, as a sign of baptism. 

The greatest, richest and mightiest cities, as Antioch, Nineveh, Babylon 2c., are now nothing but little huts, and like old ruined walls or heaps of stones.

If | will, | will say, | will tear you down and burn you, and put a new one in your place. 

The peoples in the exit of the sun keep themselves very moderate and retracted, need neither tables nor benches, but sit on the ground, and thus hold their meal. The Romans had their lazy bed. Now Turks and Hispanics do not need tables either. 

The Scots are the most hopeful, the most proud and the most insolent: they think and allow themselves to think that they are the only people above others: they have woven themselves into Germany, almost into all cities. In Erfurt and Wurzburg they have their own monasteries with rich income and interest, only for the Scots; they take no one else from other nations. 

The king of France has a hundred Scots and a hundred Swiss as his satellites, who wait for his body and go with him on foot wherever he goes. Although the Scots are despised and rejected by all nations, like the Samaritans by the Jews, and can be seen as if they were therefore called Scotos, Sectos, Sectos, isolated, as they do not keep any neighbors, they fall quite wickedly in England, unawares, and plunder it; so that in England, so after Scots, they are called Scotos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos, Sectos.

The best and most fertile fields lie uncultivated and desolate. 

The English have held about all of France, up to Bourges, and built many cities and houses in it; but finally they have been defeated and driven out at Monheri, 1) between Paris and Orleans. However, they still hold the best port in France, Kales, 2) where all inhabitants and citizens must be English and speak English, not French, at certain hours, under a considerable penalty. 


28. by Venetians. 


(Until from the last paragraph at Cordatus No. 1472. 1556. 1467. 1468.) 


Since there were 6,000 robbers in Cyprus, and since it was a mountainous island and could not be cleansed of them, the Venetians made a covenant with them that they would go out safely if only one brought another's head with him. So they got one jack with the other. But they had become robbers because of debts. 

When the Venetians were about to receive 24 galleys loaded with grain sent by the Turk with shouts of joy and great rejoicing at the time of the famine, they all sank in the sea; so that God showed them that He wants one to look into His hands. 


3) God alone feeds us, not wealth, 


1) Monthlery. (Férstemann.) 2) Calais. 3) The same process is also told in the following paragraph. 


Cap. 76. Of lands and cities. § 27. 28. 


1633 


and available money only makes us lazy, but does not feed us, however abundant it may be. For the Venetians, who are the richest in our time, have suffered a terrible famine, and having bought 24 galleys full of grain from the Turk, these have sunk in the face of the city. The depth [profund] did not hold faith. At that time a citizen sent his wife to a merchant for grain. He promised to give it if she agreed to sleep with him. She gave her consent, but arranged for her husband and her servants to lie down next to the bed in his house. The whore's evil must have passed him by. And when he demanded payment, the man said that his wife had paid by sleeping with him. But when he sued him, the merchant was found guilty by the authorities and ordered to give the grain again. Money does not drive away hunger, but makes it. 


An example of this is that in the past everything here was offered for sale, and the butchers were forced to ask people to buy the meat. Now, however, because many strangers are in town, they are not interested in selling, but only in accumulating a lot of money. That's why they sell at a high price; everyone works hard for the money. 


Venice, the richest city, does not respect politeness and respectability much, seeks only its own. They are neutrals, wear on both armpits, hang their coats to the wind. Now they are with the Turk, soon with the emperor: whichever part has the victory and is incumbent, that is the one they are with. There is nothing more there than large, beautiful, splendid houses, clothing and stinginess.

The 77th chapter. 


Of the city of Rome. 


1. of the abominable wickedness and the regiment at Rome. 2. from D. Luther's journey and train to Rome. 3. the Spaniards and Italians wickedness. 


|. Of the atrocious wickedness and the regiment at Rome. 


Since Licentiate Liborius of Magdeburg and M. G. Spalatinus, former princely Saxon court preacher, were present and with M. Luther, he said: "Because our Lord God has brought me into the ugly trade and game, | would not take a hundred thousand florins for not also having seen Rome: otherwise | would always have to worry that | was doing violence and injustice to the pope; but what we see, that we speak. 

Bembus, an exceedingly learned man, having seen Rome well and having been in awe of it, is said to have said: Rome would be a stinking cesspool, full of the most wicked boys in the whole world. And one of them wrote: 


Vivere qui sancte vultis, discedite Roma, Omnia hic ecce licent, non licet esse probum. Who wants to live Christian and pure, He moves out of Rome and stays at home. Here you can do whatever you want, but being pious doesn't count for much here. 


At this time of the Gospel, there were some in Rome who punished their evil and wickedness, such as Ludovicus, a barefoot monk, and Egidius, an Augustinian, as well as other two preacher-monks who punished and rebuked the error of the papacy. But soon the next morning they were found dead, and their tongues were cut out and stuck in butts. 1) They were given a chorus of straps 2) that were found in the alley at the 


1) Cf. cap. 27, § 140. 

2) This is the name of a truly inhuman torture, which consists of bouncing the punished person by twisting his arms out of his armpits, so that he often cannot use them again in his entire life. (Férstemann-Bindseil, Vol. | V, 685.) 


The pope will not be caught in the night, or otherwise punished in life, if anyone speaks a word against him, for his name is: Noli me tangere: do not attack me. 

Rome was conquered and destroyed three times by the Germans: first by the Longobards, the Goths and the Wends. So also now the pope is challenged. 

Rome, as | have seen it, said D. M. Luther, is large, encompassed in the area a good mile away, as far as from Wittenberg to the Poltersberg. From this, everyone can assume what a large place it must have been in the round. He also read from the chronicles the number of the citizens of Rome, who would have been there a hundred years before the birth of Christ in forty-one times a hundred thousand; but not long after, they would have numbered ninety times a hundred thousand. That should be a people, since it is otherwise true. 

Then the Magdeburg licentiate said that she could still manage five hundred thousand men: Venice three times a hundred thousand Schorrstatte, or Camine; Erfurt eighteen thousand Feuermauern. Nuremberg is barely half Erfurt. 

In Rome there are two families, which are always against each other and enemies, Columneser and Ursiner. The one is the smallest, the other imperial and the most powerful. Pope Paul was an Ursian. 

One can hardly recognize the old Rome's footsteps, since it has stood. One sees the Theatrum and the Thermas Diocletianas, the warm bath of Diocletiani, which is conducted five and twenty German miles from Neapolis in a beautifully built house. Ah, there were treasures and riches of the world, therefore they also took and did what they desired. 

An old priest ate on the evening with

Cap. 77. of the city of Rome. §1-3. 


1639 


The power that began to grow in a godless people | The Roman court had twelve naked maidens standing 


after the civil war. | often wonder how such a great power could grow and exist without knowledge of God. It truly grew great, especially in the Punic war with Carthage. There the oxen stopped at the mountain. For Carthage was a very populous city and a naval power, surpassing Rome and Venice, under whose rule were all the islands of the Mediterranean Sea, Corsica, Sardinia and all Spain, and very famous for victories. That is why it is called in Punic and Chaldean language Carthage, i.e. the House of God. If Hannibal had completely defeated the Romans, only the Chaldean and Punic languages would be with us, like the Latin. But when the Carthaginians were defeated, the Roman Empire began to grow infinitely, so that Virgil wrote: | have given an empire without end (Aen. 1, 279). Julius Caesar never thought that Rome would become such a corpse. But Scipio foresaw it very well, since he is said to have wept at the fall of Carthage [and said]: This is what will happen to Rome. It has indeed happened. It is often destroyed, most of all by the Goths. | hope it will also happen to the Turk, who is in no way equal to the Romans, since he has only the eastern part of the Roman Empire. He does not yet have Illyria and Hungary, although they lie to the east. Let us ask God to protect us from war, even though war is a lawful thing and an act of the authorities, not only a defense and defense, but also a revenge. 

No one believes what evil and abominable sin and shame go to Rome: no one can be persuaded that such great wickedness is there, if he sees, hears, and experiences it. Therefore they say: If there is any hell, Rome must be built on it: 1) for there all sins go in pregnancy: not beggarly avarice, but blind avarice, namely contempt of God, abominable idolatry, sodomitical sin 2c. Tiberius, the pagan emperor, even if he was an unflatterer, as Suetonius writes, is still an angel compared to the present emperor.

before the table for supper. 


2. D. M. Luther's train and journey to Rome. 


Doctor M. Luther said: He did not want to take a hundred thousand florins for not having seen Rome and obviously having experienced himself how the popes and bishops had deluded the world. For Judas' rope would also have been for the sanctuary of Rome. This should not be forgotten, so that one may consider in what darknesses our ancestors have walked. Our nobles are now sitting in the rose garden, but they will also have to deal with the thistles. 

Rome used to be the holiest city, but now it is the most wicked and shameful. We are like the prophets, who also complain about Jerusalem and say: "The noble, faithful city has become a whore. For out of the best always comes the worst, as the examples testify at all times. The world always remains as it is, that is, unfaithful, perjured, ungodly, the devil's kingdom and bride, and Christ's enemy. 


3. the Spaniards and Italians wickedness. (Lauterbach, Jan. 21, 1538, p. 13.) 


On January 21, Heinrich Schneidewein was there as a guest of the doctor, and they discussed much about the wickedness of the Italians and Spaniards; both were deceitful, but the Spaniards surpassed them in cruelty; they were a very fierce people, they were the right frogs over the whales. Many wise people argue whether it is easier to suffer the Turk than the savagery of the Spaniards. For the Turk takes money and is a protector. But the Spaniards do not do this. That is why the bloodthirsty pope calls these cruel people against us, namely the emperor and the French. The priests want everything to fall to pieces, only so that they themselves can rule. For the pope's bulls are nothing but water bubbles. Where the emperor does not add to this with his sword, then it's over with the pope. Schneidewein testified to this with the clearest experience.

The 78th chapter. 


Of profession. 


1. Divine profession of teachers is their greatest comfort. 

2. God wants diligence and faithfulness in every man's profession, for he who is negligent in small things is also negligent in the greatest. 

3. a rhyme by Luther. 

4. v. Luther's interpretation on the saying Ps. 45:10: In your adornment therefore go 2c. 


1. Divine profession of teachers is their greatest comfort. 


If those who are in the teaching office do not have joy and comfort from remembering the one who called and sent them, then they have had enough trouble. Our Lord God had to ask Moses six times. And he also led me into it: if | had known it before, it would have taken effort for him to bring me into it. Well, since | have now begun it, | will also lead it out with him. | did not want to take the whole world, that | should start it now, for the sake of the extremely heavy worry and fear. Again, when | look at the one who called me to it, | would not have started it either: | do not want to have any other God now. Others who have lived before me have attacked and punished the pope's evil and annoying life: but | have attacked his teaching, 1) and rushed into monasticism and the mass, on which two pillars the whole pontificate stands. | should never have foreseen myself that these two pillars would collapse; for it was as much as if one had attacked God and the creature. 

This is the devil's way with us, that no one is satisfied with it: as God has willed it with him, so he does not like it. Aliena sem- per nobis plus placent: what is of another, pleases us always better. As also the pagans have said of it: Fertilior seges est vicinis semper in hortis, vicinumque pecus grandius 


1) Cf. cap. 27, § 95.

over. So do we poor people in our profession and status: nemo est sua sorte contentus; optat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus. 2) The more we have, the more we want to have. 


2. God wants diligence and faithfulness in every man's profession: for he who is negligent in little things is negligent also in the greatest. 


Doctor Luther said in 1540 that if a noble woman had hired a maid, she would have thrown a broom in her way; if she had left it lying around, she would have given her leave, for she who leaves a broom lying around does not pick up a barrel. And this is also the case in all regiments: whoever is in a regiment should not despise anything small. The Romans also learned that no small enemy should be despised. For when they had defeated Hannibal and thought that they were now safe, the bellum Carthaginense began all the more. Therefore, children should be taught in good time to be diligent even in the smallest things, otherwise such rascals will come to nothing. 


(This paragraph in Kummer, 2. Theil, p. 405b [Lauterbach p. 205 f.] July 1543.) 


D. M. Luther wrote with his own hand on his wall by the furnace [Luke 16:10.], "He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in the greatest; he who is unfaithful in the least is unjust also in the greatest." 


2) Cf. cap. 45, § 29. 3) So put by us, instead of: "Therefore, one should get used to being diligent in time, even in the least" 2c. 


1642 Cap. 78. Of the profession. §2-5. 1643 


Cause is: On the lobes dogs learn to eat leather. 


So also: He who is diligent in the least is diligent in the greatest. He who does not respect the penny will not be master of a guilder. If you miss an hour, you miss a day. He who disdains the small will not enjoy the great. He who spurns the head, the chicken will not. Jesus Sirach [Cap. 19, 1.): "He who does not hold a little to rath always corrupts away." Sprichw. 18, s9.): "He that is lax in his doings is a brother to him that corrupteth himself." Sera parsimonia in fundo, saving is harbored for too long when there is nothing left. Parsimonia magnum vectigal, the savings penny is richer than the interest penny. The one who disrespects the letters will never learn anything great. He who will not feed himself with a hundred guilders will not feed himself with a thousand. Fronte capillata post est occasio calva. [The opportunity must be grasped in front, because behind it is bare). 


3. D. M. Luther's Rhyme. 


1) He who knows, let him be silent. He who is well, let him stay. He who has, let him keep. Misfortune comes soon. 


4. D. M. Luther's interpretation of the saying Ps. 45, 10: "In your adornment go the daughters of kings." 


(The first paragraph of this § is shortened from the sermon on 15 Sonnt, according to Trm., Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. XIll, 2361 f., N17, 18 and 19, therefore omitted. Perhaps also the following paragraph, which we have left, is only a remodeling of §19. 


1) These rhymes in Mathesius, St. Louis edition, p. 224 ina slightly different version. 


Item, at another time D. M. Luther said: Serving God right means that everyone remains in his profession, no matter how small it may be, and first listens to God's word in the church, then to the authority, rule, or parents' word, and follows the same. This is called serving God rightly. 


5. that one should not miss Occafiones or opportunity. 


Doctor M. Luther once said about tables: It would be the devil in the people that they do not let them say what is to be said to them. They do not want to hear the truth when it is told to them; then, if they would like to hear the truth, there is no one to tell it to them. That is why they say: Fronte capillata post haec occasio calva. 

Our Lord God has made this clear in the whole of nature. A farmer shall sow his barley and oats around Easter: if he lets it wait until Michaelmas, it has been harvested too long. When the apples are ripe, they should be broken off: if they are delayed for a long time, they will be gone. Procrastinatio est properantiae contrarium vitium. Just as my servant the wolf does, when four or five fall on the flock, he will not move the yarns, but says, O | will wait until more come; so they fly away again, and he keeps nothing. Therefore Occasio is a great thing, and Terentius also said rightly: In tempore ad eam veni, quod est omnium primum. The young boys in school do not understand this, they are seniles et imperatoriae voces8. Julius Caesar has been a man who has understood Occasionem. Pompey was not such a man. Neither was Hannibal. One cannot say what Occasio is, therefore one does not understand it. In German, you can't talk it out with any word, because the word opportunity est magis alligatum loco et personis, quam tempori? Occasio is supposed to have plus temporis. The Latins also do not have a word that they could use to talk it out. For the word tempus is too general. | consider that the etymology is a cadendo, as one speaks, a coincidence. The 


1644 


The Greeks also have only one word, which is called Tempus, and one would like to pronounce it thus and lay: Use of the hour, and what the hour brings with it. 

It is a strange thing, rem tam praeclaram, et quae est rerum omnium prima; Item, negligere Tempus, that one should not be able to speak such. And very few understand, especially the youth. No boy or young journeyman understands it. Therefore a father and a preceptor belong to it, they should hold it with the rod, so that they do not miss it, otherwise it is lost. Summi imperatores have not understood it; or even if they have understood it, they have neglected it. There is many a young journeyman who has a scholarship at six or seven years, there he should study, has his Praeceptores and other encouragement; but he thinks: Oh, you still have time enough, and will come to it well. No, journeyman, fronte capillata etc. is the name. What Hansel doesn't learn, Hans won't learn either. The Occasio greets you and gives you her hair; as if she should say: See, there you have me, take hold of me. O, thinkest thou that she will come again. Come on, she says, if you don't want to, grab my butt. 

Bonaventure is a poor sophist, nor does he say: Qui negligit occasionem, negligitur ab ipsa; for it means: Take hold because it is time. Nunc, nunc, because the nunc is there. The Germans have beautiful proverbs about this, and say: If one beats a piglet, he should hold out the sack. Item: If our Lord God greets one, he should thank him. This is a very fair saying, that our Lord God sends the occasion. Item, they say: God gives the gland to idle hands. But it is donum Dei, who shall understand it. 

Our Emperor Carl did not understand the occasion when he captured the King of France before Pavia in 1525. After that, when he had Pope Clement in his hands and captured the city of Rome. In 1527, and in 1529, he almost had the Turk in his clutches before Vienna. There was Occasio; but Emperor Carl would not thank God when he greeted him; what good fortune should he give him? It was enough that a monarch should have the three most powerful heads in 


Cap. 78. Of the profession. §5-7. 





1645 


and let it come from them in such a disgraceful way. That is why it is called: post haec occasio calva. Young people do not believe now that they have good occasions to study. 


6. one should not trust too much. 


Dominus Phil. Melanchthon once recited over Luther's table this fable from the verse: Crede parum, tua serva, et quae periere relinque; and said: Someone had caught a small bird, and the bird would have liked to be free, and said to him: O dear one, let me go, | will show you such a delicious precious stone, which is worth many thousand guilders. No," said the little bird, "you shall go with me and see the precious stone. The man let the little bird go, and the little bird flew up a tree, sat on it, and gave him the precious stone: Crede parum, tua serva, et quae periere relinque: he left him the beautiful precious stone. As if the little bird should say: Since you had me, you should not have believed me. Tua serva, that is what you have, keep it. Et quae periere relinque: if you have lost it, you must have patience. 


7. no one shall abuse his profession. 


Doctor M. Luther said in 1546 that no office is so small that it is worthy of execution. And then he told this story: Once, a cow in a village had badly bumped and damaged another farmer's cow. When the farmer's wife came running to him and wanted to complain, she said: "Mr. Schuttes, a strange cow has hurt and wounded mine, | ask you to help me so that the damage may be paid for: what does the cow's master owe me for the damage? The Schuttes said: Dear neighbor, he should give you an old shock 1) for the damage. Then the farmer's wife said: Yes, dear Mr. Schuttes, it was your cow. Then said the Schuttes: Was it my cow? that is another thing. And wanted to give the woman nothing for the damage. 


1) l-e. sixty pennies, worth one gold. 


1646 


8. that one should not easily believe and trust everyone. 


Epicharmus says: Nervi atque artus sapientiae sunt, non temere credere; therein consists the right strength of true wisdom, if one is not gullible: for he who soon believes is easily deceived. Item: Let no one take another for his trusted friend unless he has first eaten a bushel of salt with him. The ancients made a fine apologue about this: that a rooster had been sitting on a tree, and a fox had said to him, as he was passing by, that he should come down from the tree, for a land peace would have been proclaimed, and all discord, displeasure and dissension among men and animals would have been abolished and laid to rest for eternity. 


. Cap. 78. Of the profession. §8. 


1647 


so that one should mean the other recently, and one should honor and promote the other. But the rooster gave the vixen this answer: "It may be," he said, "that acommon truce has been established and everything has been stopped. But the newspapers have not yet reached me and announced it. But | will keep my word, as my ancestors of old have always kept with you foxes and your kind. And said D. M. Luther said: "The holy scripture says that one should not believe all spirits; for if the rooster had believed the fox, he would have lost his life. 

D. M. Luther also gave up a riddle and said: What is this: It is too narrow for one, just for two, too far for three? Answer: Secrecy; for if three know something secret, a hundred know it. 


Chapter 79. 


Of drunkenness. 


Doctor M. Luther said: "If the German country did |that Cornelius Tacitus wrote that among the ancient not have so much silk and so much spice, there would |Germans it was no disgrace to drink day and night. be no danger, and Germany would be much richer |Now a nobleman heard this, and asked him how old 


than it is. Item: We could well do without barley and drink water instead of beer; although the young journeymen have no joy at all without beer. For gambling does not make people happy, nor does booing make people happy. That's why they drink before they drink. As it was proved at the princely camp in Torgau, they didn't drink whole and half, but one had to give the other half a pint of StUbichensKandeln. That is what they called a good drink. Sic inventa lege, inventa est et fraus legis. 

M. Georgius Spalatinus had once said to Prince Frederick of Saxony's court: 


this was, since it was written? When he answered, "It is about fifteen hundred years old. Then the nobleman said, "O dear sir, since drinking to the full is an old and honest custom, let's not stop it now.

On November 15, Luther traveled with D. Jonas to the Elector, who had summoned him for the sake of the most important matters, with Franz von Weimar, the Vice Chancellor, accompanying him with three very beautiful horses of his own. Luther said with a laugh: "How great hatred will be aroused by the happiness of this man who has risen so much in prestige in such a short time! They must see, as they themselves speak, that the painted Christopher becomes the living knight St. George before their eyes. For this man got a great name by his legation to the king of England. The king received him very favorably, heard him, and dismissed him with gifts, and wished to keep him in England with a very large salary and make him a knight of the realm. Afterwards he told beside the carriage with how great zeal the king had been aroused against the papacy, that he had asked in the first conversation whether it was true that the princes and the teachers in Germany were divided in the matter against the pope, which he had heard from very truthful and credible people, Mag. Franz, however, had refuted this with great consistency, saying that it was a very impudent fabrication; if His Royal Majesty learned that this was true, he and his colleague would be in eternal imprisonment. By this news he fortified the King of England very much and got quite free access, where he said much of the very constant confession at Augsburg, D. Jonas said that there many had said to the teachers: 


Gentlemen, if you do not dare to keep it, think that you will not lead the country and its people into harm. But the teachers would have answered: If you do not want to stand with us, then let us alone come before the imperial majesty and answer for ourselves. The Elector John, however, said with the greatest zeal and in the faith of Abraham: "God does not want that, do you want to exclude me? | will confess Christ with you. 


2. of the blasphemies and calumnies in the courts. 


Doctor M. Luther said: How was Daniel? The court guards also sought a cause for him, and would have gladly come to his aid. Since they could not, they finally came with a commandment that no one should ask anything in thirty days except from the king. They seemed to do this so that the king's authority would be elevated. Now Daniel prayed three times a day, and when they saw that he had opened the window against Jerusalem, they came to the king and accused him. Then the king defended him all day long, but he could not save him. They overpowered the pious king: the Medes and Persians must go away. The king was very distressed, slept, ate and drank neither; for Daniel was to be put into the lions’ den. Early in the morning the king came to him, for he loved him. Daniel was a wise man, so he wanted to make him ruler over the whole land. He was useful to him in the regiment. The princes of Persia did not like this, for he who serves well at court soon has enviers and haters.

3.a court verse, often cited by M. Philippus Melanchthon, useful to know for the courtiers. (Not from Luther.) 


4 Philipp Melanchthon's verse from the court fief, to D. Casp. C. Anno 1542. (Not from Luther.) 


5. from the farm life. 

Philippus Melanchthon once said to D. M. Luther: Court life is not unlike the books of tragedy, which are bordered on the outside in gold and purple, but are filled on the inside with miserable events. M. Luther said: "Everyone still wants to be in the courts, they all want to become rich, powerful and great there, and some succeed; for: ln magno magni capiuntur flumine pisces: Great lords can make a poor journeyman rich. 


6th Court vers. (This § Walch, old edition, vol. XIV, 1363.) 


7. rhyme D. Martini Luther's. 

Doctor Martin Luther once told these rhymes about 

tables: 

Dominion without protection, wealth without benefit. Judges without justice, Lotter 1) and Spitzknecht. 2) Trees without fruit, women without discipline. Nobility without virtue, impudent youth. Arrogant priests, boys who gape uselessly. Evil obstinate children, people who are of no use to anyone. Envious monks, miserly plates, may one be well advised on earth. 


Cap. 80. of court life. §3-12. 


1651 


9. lutheri rhyme, There is no better cunning on earth, For he who is a master of his tongue. Knowing much and saying little, Not answering all questions. Speak little and make it true. What you borrow, pay in cash. Let everyone be who he is, and you will remain who you are. 


10. other rhymes of D. M. Luther. Doctor Martin Luther once told these rhymes about the table: Believe no wolf on wild heath, Nor no Jew on his oath. Don't believe any Pabst on his conscience, you will get screwed by all three. 

At another time he said these rhymes: Virtus is beaten to death, Justitia suffers great distress. Temperantia is bound. 

Veritas bites the dogs. Rides walks on stilts. Nequitia is not strange. 


11. from gold. Doctor Martin Luther once told about the little word gold this aenigma: | know a word that has an L, gold. Whoever sees it, quickly covets it; But when the L is gone and off, GOD. Nothing better is in heaven and earth. 


12. ingratitude of the entrenchment diggers at Wittenberg against D. M. Luthern. The entrenchment diggers or rampart workers, 


8. Martin Luther told these rhymes, Beware of the alchemists | who were working on the rampart in Wittenberg, were 


Sichlet und vor der Juristen Codice, Vor der Medicorum Recipe, vor der Pfaffen praesta quaesumus Domine, willst du mit einem vollen Beutel zu Markt gehen.

supposed to take a little earth out of Martin Luther's secret chamber. Now they complained and did not want to do it. Then the doctor said: "Shame on those proud drops to carry out a little earth, when | have carried the greatest dirt out of the world, namely the Pabst's dirt; that has become much more sour for me. Then D. M. Luther asked Magister Holstein: Who (to speak with breeding) would be the biggest shithouse sweeper? When he did not know how to answer, the doctor said, "It is the mother, because she carries the child in her arms. 


1652 


The mother gives birth, hangs it on her breasts and breastfeeds it; then it shits in her lap as a reward. The mother must sweep out everything. 


13. to dislike a thing. (Cordatus No. 1118.) 


If you want to dislike a thing, just say that it is mean [known], and it will be despised. This is what the Elector Frederick of Worms did. When a vehement refutation against my writings came from Rome, which all the bishops eagerly bought, he slyly said: "Oh, | saw and read it three years ago, and they left it. 


14. use of the fables Aesopi. 


Doctor Martin Luther once praised the Aesopian Fables very much, and said: "They should be translated and put into a fine order, because it would be a book that not one man has made, but many great people have made at any time in the world. And itis a special grace of God that the little book of Catoni and the fables of Aesopi have been preserved in the schools. They are both useful and splendid little books: Cato has good words and fine praecepta, so very useful in this life; but Aesopus has fine lovely Ac si moralia adhibeantur adolescentibus, tum multum aedificant. And as much as | can judge and understand, next to the Bible there are no better books than the Catonis scripta, and the Fabulas Aesopi. Meliora enim sunt scripta ista, quam omnium Philosophorum et Jurista- rum laceratae sententiae. Ita Donatus est optimus Grammaticus. And D. M. Luther said on it the fable of the wolf and sheep. Item, the funny fable, ujus Morale est: Non omnia ubique 


Cap. 80. of court life. § 12-16. 


1633 


When the poor donkey was terrified at the wolf's death and murder, he wanted to pretend out of fear, and said, "O king, it's so hot here. But the lion came upon him and tore him to pieces. When he asked the fox how he liked it and how it smelled in his den, the fox said, "Oh, | have the snout now, | can't smell anything. As if to say, "It will not do to repeat all things," he became wise to other people's harm and kept his mouth shut. 

After that D. M. Luther told another fable, contra praesumptionem et temeritatem, and said: that one had bought a skin from a bear and had paid for it, before the bear had been stung and caught. Whereupon D. Luther said: One should not throw away the old skirt before one has a new one. 


15. from fools. 


Doctor Martin Luther said: "There was a jester in Wirzen or not far from there, who dressed sadly during Shrovetide, had a bad time and was miserable; on the other hand, during the Holy Week he put on beautiful clothes and was cheerful and in good spirits. When he was asked why he was doing this, he answered: “During the carnival, many sins are committed, so one should be sad; but during the week of martyrdom, one preaches how Christ died for poor sinners, so one should be happy. That was a fine speech from a fool. 


16. by Albrecht, Narren am sachsischen Hofe. 


Doctor Martin Luther said on another occasion that Herzog] Frederick, Elector, had for a time called Albrecht, Fool, his son, and yet gave him nothing to eat, which had displeased the Fool. But not long after

whatever else he could get, and threw them to the dogs. When now His Electoral Grace asked him why he did that. Grace asked, "Why did he do that?" the fool answered: Date et dabitur vobis: Give, and it shall be given to you again. Luc. 6, 38.

2. another, of interpretation of the New Testament. 


Doctor Martin Luther said that M. Philippus Melanchthon had forced him to translate the New Testament, because he had seen that one had interpreted the Evangelist Matthaum, the other the Lucam; so he would also have liked to bring Sanct Pauli Epistles, which had become somewhat dark or obscure, back into the light and into a proper order. Erasmus would have written about the New Testament and made many words about it, but it would have been very pointed.

The devil took great offense at the lowly and foolish works of our Lord God in sending His only begotten Son down from heaven into the world and placing Him in the womb of the virgin Mary.

9. human blindness, that one does not recognize the physical goods of God. 


Doctor Martin Luther once drove over a meadow and said: "Now the right and true meaning of these words comes to me, since God speaks in Moses to the children of Israel, Ex. 3, 8: "I will give you a land flowing with milk and honey", that is, everything that belongs to this life, this land will have superfluously. Consider what good and good alone come from the meadows, for meadows give milk, butter, cheese, roast meat, wool. Do we not have to confess ourselves that the divine majesty has painted itself also in the smallest and least creatures, that our reason must see, grasp and feel him as a creator of the world, also as a sustainer of all creatures, who gives everything abundantly to enjoy O our sorrowful blindness and great unbelief, that we do not see nor believe such things; yes, also do not recognize God's gifts, nor ever thank God for them. 

In former times, said D. M. Luther, then | could not understand the verse in the song of Moses, where it is said 5 Mos. 32, 13.: Mei de Petra, God give honey from the rocks; because on the rocks there grows grass and trees, there fly the little bees on the flowers and on the blossoms, and suck the juice of it, and work honey from it. 


1V. Of book printing house. (Cordatus No. 983. 984.) 


It is wonderful that all the arts have now come to light in the same way, and that at the same time all of them are despised so much, like the art of printing, the highest and last gift of God, through which He drives the thing, but how despised it is also by those who practice it! 

It is the last flame before being extinguished in the world. It is at the end, as Jerusalem happened when it despised the very best Christ with his most holy preaching; then it perished. But it is not because all the saints who sleep (as it is written in Revelation [14:13]) are waiting for that day.

11) How worldly hopefulness has been punished. 1) 


D. Martin Luther said over tables in 1543: "Courtship must perish, as can be seen in the case of those of Brick in Flanders who, without any just cause, imprisoned the Emperor Maximilian in their city and wanted to tear off his head: when the von Brick wrote to the council of Venice, seeking their objections, the Venetians replied: Homo mortuus non facit Guerram. But methinks the people of Brick have realized it. Solomon says (Proverbs 16:18): Superbia praecedit casum, et exaltatio casum: When one begins to be proud, the fall is at the door. 


(This paragraph at Cordatus No. 1473.) 


The Venetians had painted Maximilian in very great courtly fashion, as he sought money with his hand in a bottomless bag, and the Florentines, as he rode on a crab, with the verse as an inscription: Tendimus in Latium [Virg. Aen. I, 205), nor did he humiliate them, | believe, since he is now dead, nor through our Carl, to whom God bestowed this. 

Doctor Martin Luther once said of a prince: "This duke has been esteemed very clever, but there has been little understanding behind him; but he has been like a pointer, as one has placed him, so he has also gone: the nobility has ruled it all.

Doctor Martin Luther said: "The world is like a For we cannot live any other way than the way Christ drunken farmer: if you lift him up in the saddle on one lived.

A young hermit had many evil lusts and desires and did not know how to get rid of them. Therefore, he asked the Father for advice on what to do for him. He said, "You cannot prevent birds from flying in the air, but you can control them if they do not nest in your hair. So no one will be left without evil thoughts coming to him, but let them fall out again, lest they take deep root in us. 


Supplements. 


1. ad Col. 1013 of our edition, to note 2: Probably here is a severe corruption of the text in the original. Instead of: Sicut Paulus erat, qui herebat in Epaphrodito, perhaps it should be read: Sicut Paulus enumerat et querebatur in Epistola apud Romanos initio. With the compendia (abbreviations) it would have been written something like this: Sicut Paulus erat et querebatr in Ep. apd. Ro. iitio. With this reading, pravis would then have to remain instead of humanis, and the text, hereafter changed, would read thus: "who is subject to evil lusts, as Paul enumerates such and laments such against the Romans in his epistle at the beginning."

2nd Blasius Matthew. (January 2.) 2. 


On January 2 he [Luther] was a guest in the house of Blasius Matthaus with D. Justus Jonas 2c. He said much about the glory of the Word of God and about the Papists' rage and persecution. Now let them practice quickly, and let us pray; if they do well, we will enjoy it with them. Let us only stick to the dear word, let the body be where it wants to be. - After that, wormwood beer was brought. He answered: "Oh no, they send me wormwood beer from France, Prussia, Prussia to my own house. It will be bitter enough for me. Delicious food was served with the request that he should take the house food for good. He answered: "This is not house food, these are delicious morsels, which | do not enjoy. | must not be worshipped with them. | do not appreciate them and | begrudge them to others who like to eat delicious morsels. | praise a pure, good, common house food. After that, he said about a marriageable girl (my godfather): 2) It is not good fruit. It does not lie long, always verthan! | have three in my house, because | wanted to provide good journeymen with, all three marriageable. 

The following: 2. 4, 45.

3. roschick. (January 2.) 


On this day came to D. M., in order to get advice, Georg Roschick from Wurzen, since he could no longer hold the papal service due to his conscience, whether he, according to his profession, could preach in Wurzen with a good conscience, or, since he was still drawing his salary, live here in Wittenberg. L. answered: He was free to preach God's word according to his profession; but if he wanted to study here, he could perhaps obtain through the Elector that he would be granted the preposorship instead of the salary. Afterwards he said to me (Lauterbach): "Everyone wants to ask me for advice, but | don't know whether they do it in order to learn, or whether they do it in order to scout, as it has often happened to me. That is why the ancients advised very well: one should not go overland, give medicine and advice, because it is dangerous. - On this day he wrote a letter to D. Pommer with the inscription: To the bishop of the Wittenberg church and envoy of Christ in Denmark, to his brother in mind and in heart and to his Lord as the greater. After that he said: The pope praises his cardinals a /atero. | praise pious preachers before eyes [a facie] and in heart 


4th tournament. (January 3.) 

On January 3, he sat with Georg von Minkwitz, who said a lot about lance-breaking and tournaments, which would be fine knightly play and exercise 2c. He answered: "For every profession, training is necessary, so that one gets used to fighting. For as the scholars practiced by disputations to fight against the enemies, who brought forward ungodly doctrines, and they, accustomed by the disputations, can resist, so also the young nobility must be allowed its practice. For the tournament is very pretty, almost similar to the battle itself and the battle. It is too much to scold, and too little to take seriously. The Spaniards, French and Italians should not know this exercise. Georg von Minkwitz then said that lance-breaking was more dangerous than useful and did not serve in battle.

8. the legal scholars’ void being. January 8. On that day, he said many things about the jurists, whose studies were of no account. For almost all of their books were such that they did not deal with judicial matters and law. The whole first and third book of decrees is completely dead, as well as the decrees. My last will is that none of my sons shall graduate from the faculty. John shall become a theologian; Martin is a little peeler, | fear for him; Paul shall go against the Turk.

After that, he [Melanchthon] said a lot about the theuration of wine, that there was no good wine anywhere. Luther answered: "Because when it is superfluous, we abuse it for our feasting. From it come diseases, leprosy, stone, podagra, chiragra. Those who always use wine usually suffer from podagra. Beer, however, causes dropsy. About the rules and the way of life, which the physicians demanded, the doctor also said a lot, that they forbade everything too strictly and carefully; that the life according to the prescription of the physicians would be a miserable one, since they imposed almost impossible things. That is why Birkheimer is said to have said: | would rather be a good fellow for two years than a rascal for ten.

30 Mainz. Elector. (January 21.) 15. 


This is the point of contention among them: That the Elector. 2) in Halle in the city in the bishop's castle above the table in his chamber has the neck court. The bishop has only the penalty in money. It is a great privilege without great benefit. The bishop lost this, who boasted that he could bring 800 witnesses, but the citizens of Halle come to court and eyewitnesses 3) appear. Now that he has lost hope, he irritates the emperor. He forbids the judges to speak, who have authority. They have something in mind, they want to give the comet its effect by a terrible war. The times are dangerous, the peace is rich. How dangerously they despise God! The Bishop of Mainz has the best thought, namely that there is no God. | would not have believed that the world would be so godless and wicked. Well, what is it to you? You follow me. Let the Epicureans eat and drink. The time of judgment will come. 


31. duke George the reformer of the papal court. 15. (January 21.) Duke George hates the pope, not because of his godless doctrine, which he worships, but he wants to be above the pope himself and reform the pontiff. He is the fool at the Roman court who wants to rule and reform everything, and he is ridiculed. 


32. from the Concil and the Bishop of Mainz. (Jan. 29, Tuesday.) 

On January 29th, Luther, Schneidewein, the licentiate of Magdeburg, spoke a lot about Italy, how the pope had again scheduled a council in Vicenza, which is a city of the Venetians, and does this only for appearance. For if one does not come to Mantua, an imperial city, one will move much less under the rule of the Venetians. It is Italian deceit, so that they only mock us Germans, as the bishop of Mainz already does, since he has the Elector and all princes for his best and hopes for the Emperor as a cheap and favorable judge. In the meantime, he is devouring everything. He does the same as that horseman who [when he 1) saw two robbers hurrying after him, he got off his horse, took it by the reins and raised his hand [and] shouted to them: The first one has it. By this calm behavior he persuaded them to let him go out freely. Such a man is the bishop of Mainz.

33. lombardy. (January 29.) 

After that, there was a lot of talk about Lombardy, a very good country, and Milan, 16. which would be the key to Italy. Is the Hadermetz, because of which one fights, and it is consumed in the wars more, than their incomes pay, unless God wants to humiliate those Haderhaften and extremely proud cities. For each of them strives for dominion in the realm, as Florence mocked Maximilian by placing him [in the picture] on a crab. The Venetians have painted him with a holey and empty purse. But they are well paid, for in a short time Maximilian drove the Venetians like frogs into the sea and deprived them of all power on land. Carl has humiliated Florence. See how Rome has been destroyed so often, she has been saccused seven times, not counting the last devastation and others that cannot be counted. It has paid enough punishment and left the soldiers loaded with gold. But this body of a city is full of factions, Columnesians, Ursians, Catfishes, which constantly burn with hatred against each other. 


(The following section, January 29.) 16. 

(The Conclusion, Jan. 29.) 16. These factions are the undoing of Italy. But the Germans hang together stronger and tighter under the protection of the emperor, although our opponents seek a division. For Duke George has offered his principality to the Landgrave on the condition that he would leave the gospel. | hope that he will be more sincere and leave it to the right descendants. For that comparison with Duke Heinrich is ungodly. God is a strange God, who leads things out against the wisdom of all men. He makes this one heirless, this one rich in inheritance. 

If he will want to hinder the blessing of the LORD, he will cause a war.

34. the Italians find superstitious. ie 


(January 29.) (The last section of this piece.) 

After that Schneidewein said of the extremely terrible disloyalty of the Italians, who, when they cannot harm their enemies, wait for the opportunity in the churches. There, one is often said to split the other's head open in front of the altar. Even at the highest festivals, they do not come together in large numbers, but keep themselves sadly hidden at home; moreover, no relative accompanies the corpse at a funeral, nor are they allowed to do so for their own sake, because they often fight over the inheritance at the funeral itself and kill each other. The Bacchus festivals are celebrated for many weeks with wonderful impetuosity and audacity, and they cause all kinds of misfortune among the mummers.

37th Court. (January 31.) Court courts are the best courts and judicial proceedings in our lands. There, noblemen, princes and lords can be brought to justice. That is why this type of court is hated by the nobles. Duke George would have liked to abolish this form of court.

On this day the announcement of a new council was brought, which was printed at Nuremberg, in which a certain cardinal exhorts the pope to a council and in a wonderful way scourges the previous popes and their abuses and asks for decisions of the council and the reformation of the Roman court and the abolition of the monastery people, the monks 2c. D. M. read this with great admiration and said: "Behold, | pray, what things this Cardinal writes to the Pope's face, which before no one of all the ends of the world would have dared to think. They feel something. But under the pretense of a fictitious humility they want to lure the princes, their defenders, to the concilium, since in truth they do not want a concilium. For it is impossible to reform the Roman court, for it would go through cardinals and bishops, and the bishop of Mainz would be forced to lay down two bishoprics, but laying down and breaking teeth are intolerable things.

46. the effort in wars is burdensome. (February 3.) 

After that, they talked about the cunning actions of tyrants, how Duke George thirsted for war, and although he was rich, he collected and borrowed treasures everywhere, and it was believed that he had ten tons of gold. With the treasure he has something evil in mind along with his bishops. Therefore let us pray. Money shall not do it. For war is not a matter for princes, but for autocrats. Even if Duke George had 80,000 men in the field, he must have 100,000 florins to harness. After that, two tons of gold every month. For he is forced to give each soldier five florins, which makes a hundred thousand and forty thousand, so he would have three months of money. 1) We waited here, let ourselves be warred against; if Wittenberg could hold out for these three months, then he would be forced to withdraw and in the meantime would have to fear that others would break into his country.

At that time | was plagued enough by the physicians; they gave me water, [as] if | had been a large ox; they treated my body in such a way that they plagued all the limbs. | had to be obedient to them and did it out of necessity, so that | would not seem to neglect my body.

So | feel exhausted, but if | stay in my way of life, go to sleep at the ninth hour and have my nightly rest, then | am refreshed.

it is said that faith justifies as a quality. For justifying faith is to be understood respectively, ‘auterbac > Table 


not as a quality in itself. Justice is a virtue that restores to each one what is fine. This explanation the jurist received from Simonides. But it is a threefold justice: general, particular, acceptance. Because we cannot perform general righteousness and perfect obedience to the law, therefore the gospel, the word of grace, preaches acceptance. 


51, the will. (February 5.) 


The Stoics call all concepts virtues, the Peripatetics consider the concepts virtues according to the nature of the will. The will, however, and in Aristotle is the essence 


of which the soul consists. But 25. 


According to the Latin way of speaking, will does not mean the essence, but actions and the nature of the will, so when we pray: "Thy will be done", we pray for actions and nature, so that each one in his profession may fulfill God's gracious will. 


52. monastery monkeys. 25. 


(Feb. 7.) 

On February 7, the news was told that a part of Italy had accepted the gospel and that the Duke of Ferrara allowed Paul to be read publicly. But Luther did not believe this news: it was either a fiction or an Italian trick. But the judgment of the pope that the monks should be reformed and the monks departed was very good. When | experienced the tragedy, | wanted all the more to die. Since | had advised in the beginning that the mendicant orders should be abolished, Eck and others cried out against me. So the Fran.ciscans, the Dominicans 2c. will cry out against the pope that it is a foundation. But the abbeys will abolish the monasteries; then the bishoprics will devour the abbeys, until again the matter will come to the pope, the dragon and crocodile. For a fine mystery is already rising with the names of the pope, who was formerly called the chief priest, then the most high priest, now they write him the prince of the countries principem provinciarum].

the temple of the Lord, but of wood. That is why it is called Mount Lebanon in the Scriptures, although the temple of Christ's time was more beautiful. In short, everything is over power in our times, it must break, or become different. In the past, the dishes of kings were soups, porridge, meat, with these three they were satisfied. The royal dress was just like that of a burgher, white smocks and a brace 2) on the forehead. Now there must be such prancing and eating, gold and velvet without measure. Thereby our countries are sucked dry. What could be spared daily in this in every house! Therefore Christ admonishes in Lucas (12, 29.): "Do not go up high.” It will not bear the length.

61 Cellarius. (February 13.) 

On this day D. Johann Cellarius arrived and asked for a successor for the preaching post in Bautzen. Luther answered: Where to take? Bautzen requires a learned and powerful man. Must be a workpiece. So we have neither work pieces, nor filling stones. If only five pastors died this year, we would have no others. Lack of words is to be feared because of paucity, and newcomers are to be feared because they do not always succeed.

62. the nature of the German and Greek languages is related. (Feb. 16.) 

On February 16, Luther dealt with the descent of the name Pabst; that had formerly been a common name of bishops, because Augustine, Jerome, Cyprianus called each other Papa, as their letters testify. But from where it has its origin | do not know, perhaps from children who call their parents papa, as the bishops are fathers of the churches. For there is a great similarity between the Greek and the German way of speaking, so that it would be much more appropriate for it to be the Greek language in Germany than the Latin. For the Greeks have x, v, x, which the Latins do not have, have to make do with begging, cannot write Kafe, Oel, Méthe. These are Greek diphthongs. Then the Greeks have different 8, a sharp and a simple, c is the simple and soft 8. Also the prepositions pera perd, <rbv, read like in German: Uber, with, sammt. Then the augments also agree with the German way:

That day he dined with Pocher, 1) with other distinguished strangers. Dreadful things were said about the bishop of Mainz, who was in extreme poverty and disgrace, that he could not pledge his seals and letters, but had to pledge fifteen florins per hundred annually. Jewels, pictures and land would be moved and gone. Luther answered: It is the highest curse, worthy of such a great, exceedingly faithless scoundrel, who killed his preacher, M. G*eorg Winkle?, miserably, Hans Schantzen against the prohibition of the emperor hanged, so nevertheless his own friendship with eighty thousand florins have offered, that he should be interrogated only rightly, not that he would be given free. | hope, however, that the bishop's letter and his own handwriting will still speak, although Schantzen's neck is tied. It is a wonderful disloyalty, which God, the righteous judge, will pay with the utmost disgrace. Therefore | have written in his own hands with my own hand. If thieves were to be hanged, the bishop of Mainz should first of all be hanged on a gallows seven times higher than the Giebichenstein. And | have accused him of many other things from his whore Elisabeth, whom he robbed of her jewels and chased away. He once had her carried into the monastery at Lisk in a coffin with torches, as if it were a sanctuary. He has struggled very much for misfortune. He fears neither God nor man.

On February 18, Philip was very sad and grieved about the disobedience of his son- in-law, who would not have let his daughter travel to Wittenberg, since the mother and his (Melanchthon's) children had traveled to Hagenau and should have accompanied her to comfort the father. This insolent disobedience of Sabinus so distressed the father-in-law that he did not allow any consolation, but remained alone and avoided all contact. Therefore Luther pitied him and talked a lot with D. Cruciger, Zoch and Milich about his sorrow and sadness, and that he loved solitude in such affliction, since he should have sought contact with people, was a source of sorrow to his heart. | too, he said, often suffer great trials and sadness; then | seek the entertainment of men, because the least maid has often comforted me. A man is not powerful when he is sad and alone, even if he is well grounded in the Scriptures. Christ does not gather His Church through the Word and Sacraments for nothing, does not want to put them in corners. Away with the monks and hermits, the devil's invention, because they are outside all godly stands and orders of GOD! For every man after creation is either in the household, or in the world regiment, or in the church service; outside these ranks is no man, unless he is miraculously exempted. Therefore, we must flee the solitary life as much as we can.

Luther answered, "When the eyes grow warm, it is time to break from sleep. | cannot observe the preventive means for the preservation of health. The remedies may do what they can. | eat what | like and then suffer what | can.

72. small number of preachers. (February 19.) 

After that he said about the small number of preachers that Duke George also had to hear preachers because of their rarity. Oh, if there were no lack of people, then it could be hoped that the gospel would continue even in weakness. If the emperor and other kings had as much of the gospel as the Elector, they would undoubtedly be favorable [to the gospel]. If Duke George had not come so high into denial, he would not be so obstinate, although he hates the papists no less than he hates us, because he wants to reform and exterminate both. 


The good in three ways. (February 19.) 

The good is taken in the sacred Scriptures in three ways: The natural, the addgopov[as a middle thing, the moral. If someone said: it is good not to drink wine. Likewise: The celibate state is good. So it is evil to drink wine, and marriage is evil; the inference is to be denied, because the good and the evil are not directly opposed. For "good" is taken here as a ddidgopov, but "evil" in a moral way. For the rule of the antithesis applies only in that which is directly opposed. 1) 


74. double evil. (February 19.) 

The evil is twofold, the guilt and the punishment. The evil of guilt is sin itself, the evil of punishment is tribulation. And these two are to be distinguished well, so that no one is offended by passages of the holy scripture, like the passage Is. 45, "| am_ the God who gives peace, and create the evil." Likewise, "Is there any evil in the city that the LORD will not do? (Amos 3:6) These passages speak of the evil of punishment. 


75. licentiousness of young people. (Feb. 20.) 

On February 20, Luther and Philip spoke of the very great licentiousness of young people, who could not be warned by any laws, nor by religion, nor by the reputation of parents and teachers, and from day to day let more and more of their will run wild. Luther answered: "It is indeed a great misery of human nature that it does not recognize how it is weakened by the fall of Adam, and does not resist those evils, but still lets this weakness shoot the reins. As Medea says: | see better, lesser | approve. (Ovid. Metam. VII, 20.) | hope, if God wills, that the last day will not be far away; it will put an end to all this.

(Feb. 20.) 35. 

Great is the power of the devil in the world. That is why he is called the god and prince of this world, because although he plagues all men with common misfortunes, he attacks Christians with special and very great temptations, and mainly because of their confession. For this finds less mercy than all shameful deeds. 

78. suspicion against Ferdinand. (Feb. 21.) 

When news was given of Catian's liberation and escape, he said with a sigh: "God 35. forgive me, | don't want to make a firm decision, nor should it be held against me. Nevertheless, | cannot refrain from thinking that Ferdinand is a misfortune and ruin for Germany. If he and the Bishop of Mainz, who are very much in debt, could arouse a civil and internal war, they would easily agree. For civil wars are for such people, as Julius Caesar did. But the Lord forbid a civil war. If it started, there would be a constant fire, and the Turks and the Spaniards would easily be admitted as auxiliary troops, as happened to Constantinople. If Duke George acted sincerely and fell in with his relatives, he would soon recognize the deception of Ferdinand, the bishop of Mainz and others, and then those evils could be averted.

The Elector replied: "What is right in your house is wrong in mine.

84. bishop's hat. (Feb. 22.) 

The bishop's hat is a pagan garment. St. James, the bishop of Jerusalem, did not know anything about it, nor did he have a church, but some small gathering place, just as the Gospel at the time of Paul in Rome did not have its course publicly, but privately. The first popes were like the deacons in our country.

85. disobedience of the servants. (Feb. 22.) 

The Doctor complained about the disobedience of the servant. He answered: In such unruliness it should have the yoke of the Turk, who can rightly deal with such people, who gives to each one for each day his work and his measured food, as Pharaoh in the Exodus drove the Israelites along. Such disobedient people provoke the wrath of God and misfortune from the Turk. 


86. enchantment. (Feb. 22.) 


87. the worst habits have arisen from good laws. (February 24.) 

On February 24, he marveled at the utter wickedness of the world, which could be governed neither by laws nor by grace. For from laws and habits bad customs have arisen; as in the time of Jeremiah and Ezechias the custom was kept that after the death of a man his friends came together sadly and consoled themselves with food and drink. This is what Solomon has in mind: "Prayer wine to the afflicted souls (Proverbs 31:6). From this very good habit the indulgences of the sacrificers have grown, who on the seventh, thirtieth and annual festivals have consumed everything, have made such feasting, a service of Baal Peor out of it. Thus, in the time of Augustine, people prayed once and once again for the dead. After that, the prayers and vigils for the dead were born. From good beginnings came an evil end. The best laws are corrupted. Who can order something good, since the world is so godless? On the other hand, when the tyranny of the law is lifted up and the severity of human traditions, the world goes completely unbridled and becomes presumptuous. The world already lies in incurable disease. If one would like to heal it with a plaster, it does not want to. We take 2 [parts] alum, 3 copper water, and want to bite it off. Finally, one must take axe and saws and cut it away, for an incurable wound must be cut out with the sword 2c. (Ovid. Metam. 1, 190 f.). Such hardened hearts need a beating hammer, no straw will do. But the godly may learn to walk the middle way, to hope in God and to fear Him according to the Psalm (128, 1.): "Blessed is he who fears the Lord" 2c. Ah, that we could grasp and keep both, fearing and hoping!

Someone asked if Christianity was not as widespread as before? Even though Syria, Scythia 1) and Egypt have been taken away, many countries in Europe have been won for Christ. Luther answered: The kingdom of Christ is with all peoples, even under the greatest tyranny it flourishes in Asia and Africa. And the conquest of Greece has brought the sciences to us.

93 The bishop of Mainz becomes a disgrace. (Feb. 26. Tuesday.) 

On February 26, Luther held a sermon at the castle before the princes. Afterwards, in the evening, he said many things about the sincerity of the prince and about the extremely perverse wickedness of the bishop, who had already lost his name, reputation and dignity during his life, and was considered a liar by everyone. They would not lend him money. And he said: It is dear to me that he should be disgraced in his life by his unspeakable deceits. For he is full of deceit by nature, by art, by possibility. Therefore he also said to Margrave John that he should forgive with the gospel until he died. - On this day a letter came to Luther from Christian, the King of Denmark, in which he asked that D. Pomeranus be left to him for a time, for Norway, which has over 4,000 parishes, has also accepted the Gospel, and the departure of Pomeranus from its lands would not be timely, and he asked Luther to come personally to the meeting [conventum] in Brunswick, for there were several who wished him to be present and to see him face to face. 


94. large churches. (Feb. 26.) 

After that there was mention of large churches, which would be unsuitable for preaching. For Cologne would have such a large church, with four rows of pillars, twenty pillars on each row. They are unusual buildings [beu], and are not suitable buildings to understand the sermons. Fine moderate churches with low vaults are the best for the preachers and for the listeners, because the final purpose of the churches is not the roaring and shouting of the choir singers, but the word of God and His preaching. St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome, the churches in Cologne and Ulm are very large and inappropriate. 


95 Exaggerated splendor. (Feb. 26.) 

After that, he mentioned the tremendous splendor in Kleidutig, that nothing good could follow where people walked along in the same way in splendor without distinction of persons, and that had increased to the highest degree in a few years. Duke Frederick said: "If we resist the attack, then Duke G[eorg], our cousin, will hold over it, and Leipzig will sow the whole country with the dirt, as if he wanted to say: | cannot find a way to prevent it. It is an unusual splendor from the way. One reads [Piin. hist. nat. IX, of Lollia, a Roman woman, that she at one time wore ten tons of gold worth of jewelry. That must be vain precious stone.

96. from the Count of Mansfeld, Hoyer. (Feb. 26.) 

On the 26th the Elector left again, and on that day Count Hoyer had invited Luthern to lunch. He behaved very kindly toward our father, although until then he had been an opponent of the gospel. Luther answered: God grant him the knowledge that is higher than all fleshly wisdom, that he may know Christ. For the name of the church prevents many from esteeming the truth of the gospel highly. | know what it costs me, who am in daily battle. But it is God's work that makes the first from the last. It is very easy for GOtte to mention that count in front of his brother Albrecht, who is otherwise very evangelical with his mouth, but not without aversions. After that, he spoke of the splendid adornment under the papacy; when superstition ruled, it had to be woolen and hard shirts, now with evangelical freedom it must be pure silk and velvet. The world does too much on both sides. Medium tenuere beati [Blessed is He Who Keeps the Middle Road]. 


97th Bruntzschirbel. (Feb. 28.) 

On the last February, Luther said of the good-naturedness of the Count of Mansfeld Hoyer, who, as an outstanding pope, had laughed at the papal atrocities and told that ina certain place one had directed the 11,000 virgins to the sanctuary. And Luther is said to have said, when he dined with the count, that he would like to live until the future council to see how Duke George would reform the papists according to the law of the decrees. The papists would rather choose Luther's reformation than the strict one of Duke George. 


98. letter from Luther to D. Jakob Schenk. (Feb. 28.) 

On this day he wrote a letter to D. Jakob Schenk, in which he called upon him with the last admonition to sincere repentance. Although various complaints had been spread about him by his neighbors, so far we had believed him alone more than all the others; now, however, this trust was almost beginning to waver because he was striving for dominion and had committed himself to U. G[eorg] Karg with his handwriting. If he wanted to be healthy in the teaching of the gospel, he should act sincerely, or simply be an enemy publicly. But if he should despise this last admonition of his and rely on someone, he [Luther] should trust in JEsum Christum, 1) who would have preserved him against the gates of hell and against many swarmers. Beware that you do not stumble and do not answer with writings, but with the deed itself, and fortify the wavering faith in me with the deed. 


99th Semper Day. (March 1 or 2?) On St. Semper's Day young people [molitores] came, 2) dancing for sausages. Then he answered: Dear fellows, be pious, keep quiet; dance and be merry and keep above your custom.

On March 4, Philip received a letter from England indicating that a letter had been sent to the King of England from Germany, written in a blasphemous manner by papists under the name of the Elector, so as to arouse the King against Luther, and they asked Philip to write to the King of England as soon as possible and excuse the Elector, and they marveled at the craftiness of men who would do such things at the instigation of Satan and sow the seeds of discord. 

103. about regalia and the bishop of Mainz. ; (March 4.) 

On this day, Kéckritz dined with Luther, and one wondered about the Elector's nobility, that he would have wanted to sell very extensive regalia for little money, but by God's grace this advice was changed, also by Luther's admonition that he should not despise these regalia so much, even if they were of very little use. For if the Elector will retain the exercise and jurisdiction, the bishop will also govern much differently and not dare to rage so. For he used to say these words to the people of Halle: Be obedient to me and take the sacrament under one form, and | will deal with you not only as a lord, not only as a father, but | will be your brother and friend and adorn you with great privileges of the emperor; but if you will not obey, then | will destroy this city as your enemy, so that it shall come to utter ruin. This is a papist word, even of the devil himself, who oppresses the godly minds and consciences on both sides, 2) Therefore, let us pray against the devil who now reigns, for he is displeasing to us. Oh, such regalia should not be handed over like this. Behold, how much evil befell the dukes of Luneburg; because they were not with each other in assembled fiefs, and one of them had two sons slain by the tower of Schweinitz, the family came from the Chur. For that family of the Churfiirsten has stood only 112 years. This duke is the fifth in the line. 


104. oaths of the bishops. (March 24, Oculi.) On March 24, Luther read the oaths of the bishops, how they swore to the pope and trust in this oath; they dissolve all contracts made with men and invoke the reputation of the pope. Our Churflrst said that if he had also concluded something with the bishop of Mainz,

On March 27, mention was made of Munster and other Hebrews who castigated Luther in the translation of the Bible because they arranged everything according to grammatical rules. Grammar is indeed necessary for declining, conjugating and constructing, but in speech the meaning and the thing must be considered, not the grammar. For grammar should not rule over the sense, as they scourge me in the 16th Psalm: "Preserve me, God!" This whole Psalm is [spoken] in the person of Christ, and this is His mind: O LORD GOD, behold, | die not for myself, but for the sins of the people. "Preserve," let me rise again, because | hope in you. "I have said"; my confession is of thee, that thou art my LORD, (Quoniam bonorum meorum non eges [Vulgate]. This we have translated: | suffer for thy sake, as if to say: Because | die for sins, | can have no good. Thus the Hebrew words are: XXXXXX XXXXX tobati bal alecha, i.e., for the sake of For your sake, | have no good.

Luther replied: | wanted all my books to be destroyed so that only the holy scriptures in the Bible would be read carefully. For from the books one falls to others, as it happened in the first church, since one had gone from reading the Bible to reading Eusebius, then Jerome, then Gregory and finally the scholastics and philosophers. So it will be the same for us.

On April 1, he sat at home and mentioned the strict way of life according to the doctors’ prescription, which would exhaust many people. It is true: a good way of life is the best medicine, whoever can find it. But to live according to the doctors’ rules is to live miserably. And he gave some examples of dead people who starved themselves to death [caused] by the doctors' advice. | eat what | like and die when God wills. Tempora labuntur, tacitis senescimus annis (Ovid.

114. the course of the Gospel is prevented by Rotten. (April 2.) 

On the second of April, he said many things about the very desirable course of the gospel, since the papacy would have been greatly disgraced. For it was ripe. But the devil, through mobs and the peasants’ revolt, very much hindered this course. And he told about this very annoying peasant uprising, how blind they would have been, especially in Lorraine, where they would have been killed faithlessly after peace had been concluded with them. Ah, the three sects of Miinzer, Sacramentirer and Wiedertaufer have done great damage to the Gospel, but nevertheless they have become disgraced again and the Gospel, even if weak, goes forward against the most powerful tyrants, hope also, it will keep its course, because daily the number increases. In the past, only two cities, Nuremberg and Reutlingen, were allied with the three dukes. Now there are more sovereignties and cities. If only we prayed and gave up the devilish ingratitude, Christ would reign in us. 

Then he spoke of Landgrave Philip, who was at first an enemy and a very great opponent of the Gospel, and yet he joined the Gospel; won by the clear translation of the New Testament, he gradually joined it."

God protect us from this devil. For by God's grace, no native language in Germany knows anything of that disgraceful being. When they entered Torgau, they admired the buildings and said that Meissen had small but graceful cities, while Thuringia and Saxony had larger but less decorated ones. 


119. idle life of civil servants. (April 3, evening.) 

At dinner, Philip argued with Luther that he was the highest administrator on earth, that he administered the most difficult office in the whole world, and that everyone looked at it more than at the most difficult Turkish trouble. Luther denied that he was an administrator, he was also too wavy for that. For if the world were to see our cause aright, it would be astonished at its greatness. But now all go along safely and blindly, the princes, because they are convinced that they must lead an idle life, since they are supposed to work before others and keep watch while others sleep, because they are in fact servants and defenders of all. Therefore, because they themselves do not want to work, it will be necessary that scribes be there and rule. 


120: Whether to resist the emperor. (April 3, evening.) 


121. Luther as a hunter. (April 3, evening.) 

In the evening, the Prince of Anhalt, as deputy of the Elector, asked Luther to go hunting with him in the morning and to have dinner with him. Luther answered: "For the sake of this [hunting] | am sent here: but | am not such a hunter of wild game, | hunt the pope, cardinals, bishops, canons and monks. 


122. curse of greed [mAcovegiac]. (April 3, evening.) 


123 The Bishop of Meissen to the Rochlitzer. (April 3, evening.) 

After that, the bishop of Meissen was mentioned, who had written to the widowed duchess of Rochlitz 1) that she should not change anything in religion, because this would be in the bishop's condition, and the woman should be silent in the congregation. She answered against it: That is certain, that is the bishops' duty, but because they did not want to watch in their office and were completely silent, she was forced by the salvation of her subjects. |, however, will give her the Psalm: Eructavit (Ps. 45.) to it, with the summa: If they do not want to hear men, they must let women hear and children speak. Even if religion is despised in the world regiment, it will still be

remain in the communities and in the churches. Philip answered: So in a short time we will be in the battle line. Against this Luther: We fight daily against the devil. If we resist this and have threshed the peas out of the husk [arbi aus der schut] with the word, with faith, with prayer, then let us deal well with the husk and straw. 


124. poltergeist to Subtitz. (April 5.) 


The conclusion of this section: 1) 56. 


After that, he told a story about a woman in Magdeburg who finally chased away the devil who was troubling her with a fart. But such examples do not take place everywhere and are dangerous. For the devil, the spirit and author of presumption, cannot be chased away and mocked. A believer can give such an example, which is not at all in the place of another. As it happened to a godly man who boasted of his baptism and took away the horn of a horned specimen of the devil; but when another wanted to imitate this example out of presumption, he was killed by the devil.

Therefore, they have a gallichtes meat, which does not nourish, 2) | will speak, like that Saxon

132. danger concerning the sacrament. (April 5.) 

N. told Luther and Philippus that an accident had occurred at Freiberg during the administration of the sacrament. Luther replied: "The administration must be done very carefully. If something happens, one must command God the matter. One must look more at the essence of the appointment than at the danger. Otherwise, Christ should have considered it as well. And after that he told some cases of spilling of the Blood even among the priests, how a priest spilled the chalice in his first Mass. There are many canons in the missals about these accidents.

The monks’ robbery and greed. (April 8, Monday.) 

The conclusion of this section: And after that he told the story of a monk who had shouted at a dying nobleman: "Squire, will you give this and that to the convent? But since the dying man could not speak and only gave a sign by a wave, the monk said to the son: "See, you hear that your father agrees to give that. The son said to the dying father: Father, is it not your will that | throw this monk down the stairs? When the father had given the same sign, he gave the monk 

his reward down the stairs. Those robberies of the monks were monstrous. 


135. time of Easter. (April 8.) 

Afterwards he said about the course of the year, which needs an intercalation, because the Easter feast is so extensive, because it is celebrated in every year on the next [Sunday] day after the full moon, after the equinox in Aries. This year we have it almost 5 weeks longer [i.e. later]. 1)

144 The Superintendent of Switzerland. (April 15.) 

On April 15, someone [Simon Sulzer] came from Switzerland, whom the Bernese called a superintendent. He came here first to see our churches and said of the great zeal of the Swiss to be in religious harmony with ours. Luther answered with a sigh: "Strengthen, O God, what you have worked in us. Then the latter told of the bloodthirsty thoughts of the papists, who either out of presumption or under the pretense of arming themselves against the Turks hoped to do something against the Lutherans. Both Carl and the Frenchman tried to make a treaty with the Swiss, but they were more inclined to the Frenchman than to the Spaniards, for the Bernese had completely defeated the Duke of Sabaudia, or Savoy, and had conquered many castles and cities. Luther answered: "Germany owes a debt of folly to God's word because of the contempt [of the word] and because of innocent blood. It will one day fall into one another and unfortunately become a great misery, because they want to exterminate the Lutherans; they consider them, as it were, to be the guilt for which the Turk is coming. But God grant them repentance and us a right confession, that we seek peace and covenant before God in true faith, not in trusting in ungodly covenants. He then read 2 Chron. 28, how Ahaz, the idolatrous king, made a covenant with foreign gods and godless men against God, his Lord. But it will happen to them according to the proverb Ps. 7, [17.]: "His misfortune will come upon his head." Nothing bad will happen to the godly, everything goes out to them for the good.

On April 16, it was said of the impetuous nature of Duke George and his courtly conduct, since in his temerity he would have wanted to accuse Luther. Luther replied: | have yielded to him enough and put up with his unmannerly nature, | have offered to do right by him, but he has not wanted to. | still had some letters and proofs from his New Testament. | wanted to have washed his gray colb. My person he pulls through whimsically, a changeling, a bathmaid's son. He calls this university a boys' school. Such a thing does not belong to a prince. | confess that | am the son of a farmer from Moer [Méhra] near Eisenach, yet | ama doctor of the Holy Scriptures, the adversary of the pope. That the pope is angry with me is not to be blamed on him. He has reason, but not just.

Then they talked about M. Bucer, who would become an old man through great worries and endless work, since he was not yet fifty. Luther answered: Thoughts can make one old; then also work. | have also worked at times. | have often preached four sermons in one day. Throughout Lent] | preached two sermons and read once a day. First, | preached the Ten Commandments to a large audience. For the Catechism was a new and unusual sermon. 

Weapons and supplies are not to be relied upon. (April 19.) 66. 

After that he said about the return of the Elector of Brunswick that he would come here quickly the next day, the day before Easter. Luther wondered about the speed, if only it did not mean anything bad. Well, dear God, you do it and govern, we also have princes, cities, people and provisions, money. But we do not want to insist on that, but trust in you. Thine is the matter. Our opponents have more to lose than we do, and they have as much to lose as we do. The Swiss answered: Our country is very ready for peace and for war. The papists strut very insolently against us. Luther answered: "That is why | like to see that our churches are small and in small places, like Schmalkalden, so that the papists have an opportunity to be proud against us and may be the more swiftly disgraced. 


66 F. 152 Tetzel's impudence with his indulgences. (April 19.) 

Finally, he concluded this meal with the prayer: Ah, dear God, let us do as we will, that we may not ever fight against thee, but that we may say, Thy will be done." Thus David said, "If the Lord says, 'You do not please me,' | will be there" (2 Sam. 24:12). John, the prince of the peasants, said: "If | am not a prince, let me be a nobleman. Only that we do not become hopeful, like Saul, who lost his spirit because he would not obey, but drove out David with war and killed him. That is why he became a disgrace. 

1) On April 21, Easter Day, Frederick Mecum was there and raised the divine calling of Luther, who, obtained by the sighs of many from God, would have come and lived so long without human counsel against so many tyrannies.

Luther replied: "This happened without my will, since many people advised me not to do anything against the pope. Luther answered: This happened without my will, since many people advised me that | should not do anything against the pope, in whose waving and waving away my life would stand. But |, challenged, approached like a blinded horse. For Tetzel was too rough with the indulgence, since he insolently exclaimed: "Look at your mother, how she is tormented in the flames of the purgatory; for your sake she suffers this, since you can help her with a penny. Ah, woe to you for your ingratitude, who so despise the blood-drenched grace of God for so little cost. Also at Mansfeld, when he had collected enough money, and had now laid down the cross and wanted to go away, but was not satisfied, he proclaimed the grace again, gave it for half a penny. But the people recognized the deception and gave nothing more. Therefore he went away complaining that they thus despised the grace of God, since St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome would be built with that money. The world would not stand for eight years because of such godlessness. He raged with such insolence that no one dared to speak out against him; and since he had provoked me to my theses, the short epitome of which is: It is better to give to the poor than for indulgences, he soon fumed and preached to Berlin: The heretic shall be thrown into the fire in three weeks, and in a bathing cap he shall go to heaven. Johannes HuB had the same opportunity to write against the indulgence of the pope and his avarice, but it was not yet time to put the beast to shame. | attacked not only the abuses, but also the doctrine and bit off his heart. | do not believe that Pabstism will increase again. His tyranny rages against bodies and consciences and will befall him, as Revelation (18, 6.) says: "Make it double." For he has most proudly oppressed consciences with the greatest tyranny. And the article of justification has to some extent uprooted the lightning of Pabstism. The Sacramentarians have already fought like this. But I still see two sects before me, may God defend them. Let us pray and watch. 


153 The pope rejoices in wars that prevent the concil. (April 21.) 

On April 21, there was talk of the Concilium, which the pope was fleeing, - it would be best that the emperor, the Frenchman and all of Germany cite the pope himself before the Concilium by a general vote in order to defend his teachings. Luther answered: "The pope does not allow this and knows a way to prevent the council from being promoted. That is why he does not allow the Emperor and the French to be reconciled. Even if a conciliation were to take place, no reign would go there. It would be a sin if one of the Christians were not angry with the pope, the prankster.

For under the law of Moses, the priest alone entered the Holy of Holies and prayed for the people. Thus our Lord Christ is finely portrayed by that figure. 159. two church bodies.

Jonas answered: The best times are to be hoped for the offspring, because in a few years the best lecturers would come out of it. Luther replied: | am worried that the best has now happened, but now the sects will follow.

Luther asked Jonah from the 17th chapter of the first book of Moses: How would it be possible to believe that Sarah, already ninety years old, who was no longer in the way of women, would still have been stolen by King Abimelech. Jonah answered that ninety years at that time would have been like twenty years for us. Not at all, he said, because Abraham was nearer to David than to Adam, since in David's time seventy or eighty years are called the life of a man. The springtime of the world was before the flood, after which its flowering ceased. Summa: The holy scripture is an inscrutable book, it will never be fathomed. | read the first Psalm today and in the other verse: "But have pleasure in the law of the Lord", | found a doctrine [locus], which | did not know before. That is why the Spirit of the Lord, Isa. 11, is described with so many different names. 


164 The Lightning at Prague. (April 29.) 

On the penultimate of April, news was brought from Prague that lightning had struck the church tower twice with very strong thunder, and for the third time the church itself had been struck and set on fire, and this had happened while a child of King Ferdinand was being baptized, whose godparents were said to have been the Pope's legate and orator and the wife of the prefect of Upper Lusatia. This thunder and lightning were praised by the courtiers as a sign of the great glory of the child. Luther answered: It is a great presumption of the godless who despised the terrible signs of God and dared to interpret them in the opposite sense. For also the holy scripture and the stories of the pagans indicated that a striking lightning meant great misfortune. So also the 104th Psalm [v. 7.): "From your thunder they go away." 


165 He comforts Wellern. (April 29.) 


166 The Rhinoceros. (April 30.) 

Last April Luther mentioned the rhinoceros. This animal would have an armored body and fought against the elephant and slit its belly with its horn. It is a wonderful creation of the things, since God brings opposite together, the Rhinoceros with the elephant, the water with the fire, the spirit with the flesh. | with the pope. They are opposite elements, and yet they are preserved, although one devours the other. For when water and fire collide, either the fire is extinguished or the water is exhausted. But on the last day there will be a great destruction, when all the elements will melt into ashes and the whole world will be restored to its original chaos. And then there will be a new heaven and a new earth, and we will be transformed. Satan will remain like that because he has nothing elemental. Paul had very great revelations, who made this known.

167. everything becomes small through frequency. (April 30.) 

The conclusion of this section: D. Jonas answered: "Our peasants accuse the pastors of teaching the holy ten commandments too strictly. For they teach their children and servants to do evil and wrong against all the commandments. But St. Paul is a man who does everything in remembrance of Christ. Oh that he were known to all men. But in his whole decree the pope does not treat even one passage of Jesus Christ for the consolation of a sorrowful conscience. Nor has the Roman church had a single pope who has interpreted only one book of Scripture, except Gregory, who wrote moral teachings [Moralia.) about Job. Ah, HErrgott, the Holy Scriptures demand a careful researcher. The papists, however, do not 

care about it, even despise it. 


The passage 1 Petr. 5, (v. 2.). (April 30.) 


169. hatred of the papists. (May 2, Thursday.) 

On May 2, he said of the irreconcilable haff of the papists against the gospel, which had burned indelibly from the beginning of the world. For the Babylonians in the 137th Psalm [v. 7.) do not cease, but cry out: Pure off. The Jews did not cease against Christ and the apostles until they were destroyed. So the papists today bring forward much more to exterminate the Lutherans than against the Turk. Therefore, let us pray and watch. 


The presumption seeks immortality. (May 6.) 

On May 6, he said of human presumption, since all men realize that they are mortal and frail. But everyone thirsts for immortality here on earth. In the past, kings sought immortality by building pyramids, as they do now with great basilicas and buildings. Soldiers chase after victory, and scribes seek an eternal name by publishing their volumes, as we now also see before our eyes. But in the meantime, the glory and eternity of God is not looked upon. Ah, we are miserable people. 


171 Question about taking the sacrament. (May 8.) 

On May 8, a foreign nobleman asked Luther for advice on how he should conduct himself when taking the sacrament, whether he could also take it here in both forms and then, if his journey and business were elsewhere, communicate in one form. Luther answered: "Each one should ask in his own conscience what is to be done. If he does not dare to receive it, then it would be better to let [it] be done beforehand. Each one, therefore, should consult his conscience and his anointing. "For no man liveth to himself, neither dieth to himself" (Rom. 14:7), but against violence there is no counsel.

Behold, here are two swords. (May 12.) 

After that he told about the insolence of the pope, who would have dared to confirm his prestige by the swords of the apostles. For he concludes thus: Where there are two swords, there is the church; but here with Peter there are two swords, therefore Peter is the church. Or like this: Peter has two swords; Peter is pope; therefore the pope has two swords. This is not valid, and the assumption [assumtum] must be denied, because the final speech has four exits [terminos]. Rather, it must be concluded thus: Where the totality of the apostles is and the church, there are two swords; here are two swords; therefore, here is the church. Nevertheless, it was a strange arrangement among the apostles that Christ allowed them to have two swords (Luc. 22, 38.). But Christ resolves this with the strongest solution: "It is enough", as if he wanted to say: You do not understand what | am saying; | said that each one should have and buy a sword, but a spiritual one; but you understand from these two iron swords; it is enough, they would not make it. After that he solves it much stronger (Joh. 18, 11.): "Peter, put your sword into the sheath." He did not intend that he should wield it with his fist, but discarded it [the sword]. It is as if | said to my dear sons Martimchen and Paulichen: Now defend yourselves with the wooden swords, draw them against the Turk.

Luther answered: Jonas once said that he knew everything in the Holy Scriptures, and was somewhat angry with me because | did not agree with him.

On May 21, Anton Hanold, an excellent man in warfare, said various things about the wars of Emperor Carl and about Ferdinand's very great misfortune, which would be the plague and the eating sore of Germany. Luther answered: Germany owes God a debt of thoroughness. All nations hear of the armor of the Turk, but no one thinks to resist him. The adversaries are trying to figure out how to kill the Lutherans before they resist the Turk.

For they have the habit of taking on the best and those who are very friendly to them with cursing: See that you are glandular and bruised, my lord, since their heart is without hatred; whether this is a sin. He answered, "Our speech shall be yea, nay, and the name of the Lord shall not be uselessly taken." Otherwise, their cursing may be purer than our good mornings. 


187. lying. Deceive. (May 26.) 

Lying and deceiving are different; for lying is a falsehood with the desire to harm. But deception is simply as Elijah did, who said he is not Elijah, come, | will lead you to him (2 Kings 6:19). What is to be thought of the words of Paul Apost. 23, (v. 5.): "I Knew not that it was the high priest: for it is written: Thou shalt not curse the ruler of thy people." There Paul is being mischievous, as if to say: Art thou the high priest? | know nnr One, the priest JEsus Christ, GOD will smite thee 2c. There he did not sin, but contradicted him out of apostolic spirit: Dear Annas, it will be over with you, and so he curses the whole priesthood, as if to say: You are nothing but hypocrisy itself. Otherwise, Paul knew very well that he was an authoritative person.

For a work requires the whole man. But | am busy, occupied with several things, and cannot accomplish anything satisfactory. For doing much and doing well are not suitable together.

Meanwhile, Ferdinand was walking in Dresden and begging through Lusatia. Truly a fatal evil for Germany, a dog in the run. But afterwards it was said that it was a fabrication of the papists, who wanted to gather armies under this pretext, in order to be able to exterminate the Lutherans afterwards; but the soldiers had left their flags after they had found out about this; the Nurembergers reported this. 89.

On June 14 came the news that Duke George had taken Petersberg and had installed his colonel there, and he was also aiming at Zell Monastery. Luther said: If | said that the defenders were the pope's devourers, nobody believed it. Now the papists learn it by experience; they have freely offered keys and treasures to those, now they keep them as by right. So it will work. | believe that the deception of Duke George and others will plague the papacy more than our attack.

Strong proofs, which are called principles, axioms, maxims, penetrate all things, because they comprehend in themselves all particulars [locos]: The honorable, the good, the useful, the necessary. Such is the doctrine [locus] and the proof of marriage against the celibate state, where all sane men are forced to say: This is true. 


203. from the Swiss. (June 25.) 

On June 25, Luther received letters from seven cities of the Swiss, who responded because of the union [concordia]; but since they were still limping, he said, after reading 9, through the letters: Ah, they are pious people who are persuaded. Therefore, they must be followed for a time, until they can be won over. The following day the messenger pressed for an answer. He said that he would gladly write and hoped well of them, that they would discard the opinions according to reason of Christ's descent and ascension from the right hand [of God] into bread, of which we have never taught, but we have simply believed Christ's Body and Blood without ascension and descent; otherwise we could not believe any article of faith of the Trinity and Incarnation of the Son, the Second Person, if we wanted to consult the wisdom of reason. Ah, dear God, those aversions hold many back. How do you think, | beg of you, that the Jews, who were well established in the kingdom and the priesthood, were annoyed when they saw that the righteousness of the Son of God was not the same as that of the Son of God?

208. Gospel of Lazarus and the rich man. (June 30.) 

Last June, on the second Sunday after Trinity, on which the Gospel of the rich glutton was, Luther was asked whether this Gospel (Luc. 16, 19. ff.) was a story or a parable? He answered: In the beginning it would be a story, because he named the persons, the circumstances and the five brothers; afterwards the conversations and the judgment passed by Abraham would be an allegory, which shows how it will be on the last day. It is an adventurous gospel, and yet it has many glorious passages of comfort that are worthy of careful consideration. First, it indicates that there are unknown places where souls are kept, and these secret and hidden things we are not to know. Secondly, the passage that Lazarus is not described as buried, but is told that he is carried into Abraham's bosom. He even forgets Lazarus’ body. But he describes the angels’ hats that carry him into the bosom of Abraham. This is a comforting saying, that it is more in the soul than in the body. - The bosom of Abraham is the promise and the certain salvation, the container and the expectation of Christ; it is not heaven, but the expectation of heaven. It is a wonderful thing that heaven is not revealed before the coming of Christ. The bosom of Abraham was until Christ; after that, paradise; as the robber came not into the bosom of Abraham, but into paradise; after that, by the resurrection of Christ, paradise ceases, and heaven is revealed, where the dead ascend out of open graves into heaven. But what paradise is, | do not know. It can be a rest in the body itself, as it happens with people who, seized by a rapture, feel nothing. There the soul is not gone, although it is not felt in the body; but when they come to themselves again, they wonder and say: Where have | been? | have felt nothing. So that conversation and counter-talk could very well have happened between the Schlemmer and Abraham in the spirit and in the death struggle. But nevertheless one should 


1736 Appendix No. |. 208. 209. 


1737 





Do not preach in public, because people would be made doubtful. Therefore, these avterbach Table 


allegorical things should be left aside and the emphasis should be put on the story. Christ often uses such allegories. Matth. 8 (v. 11.): "Many of the morning will sit at table with Abraham in the kingdom of heaven." Likewise John 14 (v. 2): "In my Father's house are many mansions." These are vain allegorical expressions. Ah, dear GOtt, your words are not as cold and bad as human words, but they are above all human thoughts and the wisdom of reason. How Duke Frederick admired the word of GOD, which in simplicity would have the greatest majesty. Therefore we must pay attention to the revealed word. Hidden things we should not know, but believe. Does not the fruit live in the womb, and after that, when it is born, it lives, and for two years the child eats, drinks, sucks, feels, cries, and yet it does not know that it lives, for it cannot think of anything as it lives? Therefore, what do we want to think much about the souls after death? Aristotle and Plato have discussed the soul a lot. Plato says that the soul is the idea, that is, the perfect form of the body. Aristotle, however, claims that soul and body are one being [substantia], and that the soul arises in the body from a germ [traduce] in the way that a root naturally arises from a seed and grain, then a milky rice that is neither wood nor bast, then a soft plantlet, then it grows together more and more and becomes a harder cartilage and finally a tree and hard wood. Thus the soul becomes and grows out of the body and the fruit, when it is still a milky mass. Therefore Augustine, who followed Aristotle to some extent, holds that the soul arises from the flesh and is propagated, but caused by God. For if God brings forth a flower from the tree, why not the soul from the body? Origen, however, says that the soul is not propagated, nor caused, but infused. But Augustine's opinion seems to be better. For by experience we see that souls follow bodies. For, where there is a crippled body, there is also a crippled soul. Ah, dear God, what are we poor people strutting about, since we do not know what our soul is, nor our body? The Holy Scripture argues against Aristotle, who denies that the soul is immortal, but says that soul and body are one being [substantiam] - Christ clearly says: Do not be afraid of those who can kill the body, but cannot kill the soul (Luc. 12, 4.). For the soul is a different substance from the body, and yet it is a great bond, clinging to one another, because the soul loves the body supremely. It does not like to separate from each other. Cicero was a very good philosopher, who believed that the soul is immortal, and he also described the natural, moral and rational philosophy in the best way. He was a noble man, who read and read a lot, and then he was able to say it. He wrote his thing with seriousness, he did not play and follow the Greeks like Aristotle and Plato. | hope God will also help Cicero and similar people through the forgiveness of sins, and should he be without mercy, he will still be several levels higher than our Cardinals and the Bishop of Mainz. 


209. from Bishop Albrecht. (June 30.) After this, mention was made of the Bishop of Mainz, a very cunning and devious epicure, who, trusting in his wickedness, deceived all, and

Now | will denounce him to the church, so that | will not be made a party to his wickedness. For he has acted tyrannically enough with Schantz, whom he has let hang for the sake of money. For on the very day he was hanged, the bishop was in Halberstadt and smilingly said: "I think that not everyone will laugh in Halle today. After that he is said to have said again: It is in my mind as if 1) Schantz were hanging on the gallows 2c. Are these not the words and behavior of a tyrant? Therefore, his legend must be given to the day.

211. the Gospel preached in Italy. (July 1, Monday.) 

On July 1, news was written from Italy that in Bologna, in the last forty days, two monks had very freely and sincerely preached the gospel in public, and with such conviction than it could have happened only in Wittenberg, and that they had numerous listeners with great applause, and finally the bishops and the pope intervened with force against them. They were warned and saved themselves by fleeing. Another, however, was seized and imprisoned, who had Luther's books and translations under the title of Erasmus of Rotterdam; these had been burned. M. Philip answered: "The word of God does not run in vain, but is spread here and there in all countries; if it comes to Italy, they will seriously 

stop it, because the Italians are stubborn people, not frivolous or unstable. 


212. from the Bishop of Mainz. (July 1.) 


Miracles and examples against the blasphemers of the gospel. (July 7.) 

On July 7, Luther was stricken with the disease of dysentery, since diarrhea had preceded it, and since he could not preach publicly, he preached at home the gospel of that Sunday, Luc. 15. On that day, many very godly men, including strangers, came to visit him and told various news. The Rector Philip told of a miracle that had recently happened in his hometown of Breiten, that a girl had fallen from a very high tower and remained unharmed, and that she had looked up immediately after the fall, fearing that her father would have seen it. Luther said: Allhie was no devil, but an angel Gabriel.

215, what kind of things the doctors deal with. (July 10.) 97. 

When the illness became more severe on July 10, he took a clyster on the advice of the doctors. Afterwards, he said: "This is the end of shame. Because the doctors play with the patients like mothers with their children, although they deceive each other. How D. Stortz at Erfurt did not want to give anything to a farmer who was a drunkard, should eat coriander. The latter, however, was very ignorant and bought four calendars with parchment lids, gnawed and devoured them down to the fourth and asked that he might also drink. When the doctor heard this story, he told him to drink as much as he wanted. This is what happened to a doctor in Heidelberg. A young man had impregnated a girl, and since she felt unwell as a result of the pregnancy, he brought the urine to his doctor. When the doctor looked at it and examined it many times, he looked at it and said: "Fellow, fellow, see what you are dealing with. The latter, stricken in his conscience, answered: "Ah, dear doctor, if the girl is pregnant, tell me and | will take her in marriage. Doctors deal with such things.

On July 14, a letter arrived from the court about the English legation, that they had been received very honorably by the king, and there was great hope for the course of the gospel in England. There were many bishops there ready for the pure teaching of the gospel, but there was only a lack of learned people, otherwise the people longed for and loved the teaching of the truth. 


98. 218: Twofold necessity. (July 14.) 

An unconditional necessity is one that exists by its nature. A necessity of the consequence or of the occurring case is, which could also be otherwise, as that Caesar defeated Pompey, that Judas betrayed Christ. This victory and betrayal does not come naturally to Caesar and Judas, because it is not so ordained by God, but is in the will of Judas. What has happened cannot be undone. One must let it be as it is. For everything that is, when it is, must be necessary, but by necessity of consequence.

Luther exclaimed: O Lord Jesus Christ, come with your last judgment, as if he wanted to say: Destroy the world and free your saints. Oh who would have died, | do not desire to live. On this day Johann, Duke of Anhalt, visited him; he stood in his bedroom in front of the bed and talked something secret with the doctor.

On August 4, he contemplated the very great miracle of the Gospel, where Christ fed 4000 men with 7 loaves of bread; he does such miracles daily. But no one takes care of it. If he had made all grass to bread, all trees of bread, they would have despised it, as they slandered him because of Lazarus (Joh. 11, 21. 32.): "If he had loved him, he would not have died." And since He had healed many, they demanded signs from heaven (Marc. 8, 11. Matth. 12, 38. 16, 1.). Summa: If God, our Lord, does it, it is no good. But if we choose it ourselves, it is something. Such is the wisdom of the flesh. If it is even overwhelmed, it cannot recognize it.

As one sickness pressed upon another, and the tearing of the limbs and the stone raged, Luther said, "Give patience, O Lord, and that we may only remember Thy Son's suffering and death. After all, there may be various diseases in us. This is according to the saying of Adam: No misfortune alone. As it is said of the Duke of Savoy, who in one day heard of the enmity of the King of France against him, and the alliance of the Swiss against him, and he learned of the death of his son; has been enough at once. Such is life in the world, exposed to all dangers.

Beware of the ways of the world. 








(August 14.) 

Superstition always has a place and a pretext for superstition, as the fame of the monks was from the contempt of the world. For Paul Rom. 12 (v. 2) says: "And do not be conformed to this world," as if it were ungodly to be subject to worldly orders and institutions, since Paul and all Scripture forbid only the passions and ungodly movements of the heart after the manner of the world, ambition, greed, benevolence, revenge, etc., to which inclinations the whole world gives the reins. Two years ago in Antwerp, for example, there was a splendid celebration in the world's manner, and plays were performed. Antwerp was painted on a carriage with the inscription above it: Antwerp, the Queen of the World. On one side was Neptune, who offered great treasures to the queen. On the other side Mercury offered many things. But this is the way of the world, namely contempt of God, pride and elevation in the gifts, abuse of the creatures.

Luther killed drones flying around. In the meantime, however, he considered the nature and order of bees, that no man, not even the wisest, could fully recognize the nature of bees. For when a bee has stung with its stinger, it is worthless, and is forced to be a keeper, to fetch water; thus it is degraded. And these animals perform their work with the most accurate and faithful work, and are begotten without mating.

He replied, "That provision in Moses is judicial and abolished, just as the usury of the Jews was permitted among the Gentiles and only ceased with the other judicial things. 

Third question. Why Ruth did not act according to the right of kinship, since Boaz was not the brother of her deceased husband, and the law Deut. 25 clearly expresses the brother of the deceased husband. He answered: That passage is an interpretation of the law 5 Mos. 25., namely, that if the brother of the deceased does not want, then the next blood relative after him should marry her. Furthermore, Naomi did not accept Ruth to marry this Boaz, but because she was to join him in the most intimate way, so that she might be well acquainted with him; this text we have dealt with in the English disputation. 

Fourth question. Against the Judaizers, who demand testimonies of the Old Testament, namely, that Mary was from the tribe of Judah and from the house of David, but the tribes and families were completely confused after the Babylonian captivity. He answered: "Our evangelist expressly says that Mary was of the tribe of Judah. Those who do not want to believe this may remain unbelievers. And such Judaisers cannot defend themselves with the passage, Judges at the last, where the tribe of Benjamin was broken off [v. 6.]; this tribe was no longer a people of God because of fornication, but it was a tribe cut off and banished from the people. Therefore, the six hundred were forced to marry heathen women and the stolen. 

Fifth question. About the passage of the Scripture Joshua 24, (v. 19.): "Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy GOD, a zealous GOD, who will not spare your transgression and sin." By these words he seems to reject the godless people altogether. And yet these words soon follow, "If ye forsake the Lord, and serve a strange god,” which mean that they were still pious and had not fallen away. Luther answered: "This is the last farewell of Joshua, who warns them with a special movement, as if he wanted to say: | am afraid that you will anger God once again, and God will punish you, for He does not like it. If you then anger Him and fall from Him, then God will be angry, and so on. Another solution is that the first words are spoken by the wicked, and the following by the pious. Just as we have psalms here and there in which the people are exalted to heaven and praised; soon after, they are humbled to hell, and by means of a synecdoche, the pious among the people are spoken of there, and the wicked here. This is also what we do in our sermons in our church, namely, we praise a part, the good ones, and soon, on the other hand, we scold the wicked and bad ones. Thus the church is called holy, since the least part is holy. 

Sixth question: 

Seventh question. Since Balaam repeatedly asked the evil spirit for advice and received different answers: whether he asked the true God for advice.

and received an answer from the true God. He answered: Balaam first asked the true God for advice, from whom he received an answer. He was supposed to have stuck to this word, but later, when his avarice was stimulated by the promises of Balak, he soon went to the magicians, who said otherwise. Thirdly, again the true God resisted him through the angel. But afterwards he turned again to the magicians and although the text said [4 Mos. 23, 4.] XXXXX XXX, as if the LORD had answered, they are words of fact, not of matter. As the papists praise the true God and Christ and yet praise and do the works of the devil under his name. And there the text is clear. 

Eighth question. How to understand the passage Joshua 5, (v. 9.) where it is read: "Today God has taken away the shame of Egypt from us"? He answered: The solution is 


simple. For after Moses had circumcised the people according to the law, he said: Now you 116. 


are no longer Egyptian, for you have been circumcised and are now no longer Gentiles. 

Ninth question. Whether David sinned when he himself charged Achish (1 Sam. 29, 8.) to fight against the people of God? [He answered, He did not sin]. 1) For Saul was then rejected and no longer king of the people of GOD, and he was in the position in which the Papists are now. Secondly: David did not offer his service of his own free will, but because he was among the Philistines, he is required by the king, like a servant; just as our subjects can fight against the Papist church. 

Tenth question. The passage 1 Sam. 2 (v. 25), how is it to be understood? "If anyone sins against a man, the judge can settle it. But if anyone sins against the Lord, who can plead for him?" Luther answered: "It is more tolerable to sin against the second tablet than against the first. He should only take the holy ten commandments rightly, then he will see that it is a greater sin to sin against the first table than against the second. 

Eleventh question. Whether Saul could prophesy from the evil spirit, and what kind of prophesy was it? He answered, "At the time Saul prophesied, he was not driven by the evil spirit, but his prophesying was the interpretation of the law in his house. 


270 The Bishop of Mainz a plunderer. (August 20.) On August 20, the news was told about the Bishop of Mainz that he had departed to Italy and left Germany, perhaps hoping for the papacy. Luther answered: "If this is true, it is an excellent disgrace, worthy of a cardinal, who, after he has completely flayed his cities and cathedral churches and pledged his nobles with a large amount of gold and transferred a nobleman, Kurt von Amberg, with 63,000 florins, leaves them afterwards.

After that a lie was told about D. Pommer, that he had already separated a rich woman in Denmark by divorce and had joined her to D. Peter Palladius. Luther answered: | do not want to believe it; they invent such lies against us in order to suppress the gospel, because a small occasion gives the Christians great annoyance, as in church history the Christians are accused when they come together for the Lord's Supper, then they eat the body of a killed person. This lie caused much bloodshed in Lyon, France.

Lauterbach Table logical, but grammatically | can not. However, it describes the most perfect grace and ws. __ speeches 


forgiveness of sins. All of life is given to us in this verse, "all." Second, he adds, "He that Gap Is healeth all thine infirmities." This | do not understand, what he means by infirmities, for manifold indeed is the infirmity of inclinations, of sloth, of passions. "Who redeemeth thy life from destruction" [v. 4.]. This is the strongest [absolutissima] preaching of the forgiveness of sins, this is the erasure of the manuscript, in which God presents Himself to us completely, as Satan does the opposite, who only frightens, wounds and captivates the consciences. The sum of this psalm is: God most mercifully forgives all sins by grace and heals nature in what sins are left that still cling to us. He helps and heals. How follows how they are strengthened, namely by grace and pardon, as if to say: 'So God helps His own. ' He not only washes, but also adorns us royally. But what these gifts are, | do not know so highly, because there is no desire of the unknown (Ovid. ars amat. Ml, 397); for what we do not know, we cannot speak. Therefore it follows: "Who maketh thy mouth merry" (v. 5.). Here the pen is not cut, that one should write with it what the mouth is, what the goods are, that he may fill us. Therefore he saith, "Thy desire shall be renewed." This is a remark: you will give birth to it anew, as an eagle becomes young again, although it can be understood of all birds that moult and bow. "As high as the heavens are above the earth": the mercy of God is built as high as the heavens are from the earth. But the weakness of our flesh always thinks and is in doubt that heaven will fall on its neck, since mercy and grace are far more glorious than our understanding. That is why Paul exclaims, Phil. 3 (v. 12.), that he is "not perfect, but he pursues it", and Rom. 7 (v. 6.) Paul complains about "the law that holds captive". | also console myself when | see that Paul cannot grasp such things. Away with the presumptuous who ascribe everything to themselves. "As a father hath mercy on children" [v. 13.] "And as far as the morning is from the evening" [v. 12]. This is a great affirmation, but we do not believe. But notice in this psalm how he always puts, "To them that fear him" [vv. 11, 13, 17]. They must do it. And the interpretation of those who fear him follows. "We are dust and like hay" [v. 15]. This is the description of man. But we do not believe the merciful God. The "Lord in heaven" [p. 19.]. This is the conclusion, i.e. God is powerful and active, who will not leave us unpunished, and he can repay everything.

Today's Gospel Luc. 10. about the Samaritan is very beautiful. One should preach four weeks of it, because it is popular and pleasant, [so] that the Magister Sententiarum in the fourth book will do it. For the Gospel has many beautiful passages about grace and the teaching of the Law described in the most beautiful and briefest way; then the malicious, hypocritical nature of the scribe, whom he also examines well, pays him well, for how could he make it more hostile than by painting the priest and the Levite, the holiest of God's people, so that they pass by, leave him lying there, and do not help him? If only he had said, They have not seen him. But he says that they are so hard that they have forgiven the half- dead man. 


negligent. Turks should not do that. Therefore he brings in the Samaritan, to their shame. Then there is also rich material in the parable, also of the two pennies 2c.; in short, it is a rich gospel.

320. content of the gospel of the ten lepers. (September 22, 14th Sunday n. Trin.) 


On the 14th Sunday after Trinity, he spoke of the Gospel of the ten lepers, which contained a wonderful theological teaching about faith and its effectiveness, which is to be impressed on the most afflicted consciences; then a moral teaching about ingratitude, which is necessary against the authorities and the despisers of the Word at all times. It also appears in this gospel, and eight days ago in Luke 10, and in many others, that Christ was very angry with the Jewish people, so that he wanted to take the kingdom and the priesthood from them. That is why he makes the ingratitude of the Jews so great here, in that he also praises them immensely the Samaritan, who returns as a stranger, without law, and praises Christ most highly. Jews and priests were peelers, so that the Gentile surpassed them in sincerity of faith. This means that the law is honestly preached against this most holy people: the Samaritans, who are not bound by the law, observe the law more, while the Jews insist on the law to the highest degree against the Gentiles, which they keep less than [neither] they. Summa: The law of Moses is given only to the Jews, and this passage solves many objections; that faith justifies, and the law does not concern the church as far as justification is concerned. Summa: The Jews are a very proud and superstitious people, very inclined to sophistry. Just look, | beg you, how they have twisted the passage and the glorious promise of Christ (Haggai 2, 7.) [in the German Bible 2, 8.]: "There shall be

gold, silver, power and honor. This shall come abundantly to them and they invent a new paradise, so to speak, and thus they twist the most spiritual prophecy and promise to carnal things and their belly, since they see by daily experience that their imaginations are false.

After that he asked about Job, which in German is actually called Of, as today Of [i-e. Offo] of Schrieben. For in Hebrew it is written that he was an Idumean Gentile, of the seed of Abraham, but not circumcised, long after the times of Abraham, perhaps in the fifth generation thereafter, and dwelt at Uz, at Jtzsch near Bratte, for Uz is as much as our Jizsch. The word of God is sent to him. It is very comforting that God does not despise the wretched heathen, Job, Naaman the Syrian, the Moor, the Queen of Sheba, Nineveh. He also wants them to be part of His kingdom, as if He said: "Even though salvation is for the Jews, it is not for the Jews alone. Behold, | beseech you, the Holy Spirit in the Gentile Job, with how exceedingly clear words he describes GOD, and that is, the One who took flesh upon Himself, eternal life and the resurrection of the dead, so that neither in the Old nor in the New Testament is the resurrection of the dead described in such bright words as in Job, Cap. 19 (v. 25.): "I know that my Redeemer liveth" 2c. "And at the last day" 2c. Hence we now call it with us, the last day. "And mine eyes shall see him."

That is why historians marvel at the straight nature of the Germans, who trust body and wife and children to each other. The French are horny, but the Spaniards are quite unruly and surpass the Italians and French in all wickedness. No nation can dislike them. That is why the King of Hungary did not want any Spaniard in Hungary against the Turks this year. They have beaten them all away. They are much more cruel than the Turk.

At the dinner table, the 73rd Psalm was read against the anger of the happiness of the wicked, where David complains (v. 9): "What they say must have been spoken from heaven," i.e., in the freest and most certain way, they spoke what they wanted, as the teaching of the Pope was about his power, "you are Peter" (Jn. 1, 42. Matth. 16, 18.), about indulgences. By this impertinence they challenged John Huss and me to the battlefield, insisting and concluding: because the pope says it, therefore one must believe it, although John Huss did not yet recognize the pontificate, because he only saw some abuses and concluded from the customs to the person of the pope; but we begin with the person of the pope and proceed against his customs. If the pope were like St. Peter, he would still be godless.

On October 16, the day of Galli, he said much about the trials of lawyers and trades and wars, which always fished with a golden fish. That is why it is best to reconcile immediately. If it has come to quarrels and wars, then misfortune follows. That is why the ancients spoke well and wrote it on the city gates [portis publicis]: In peace the hoe and the plow run, [Pace bidens vomerque currit. Tibuli. |. el. 10, 49.) Likewise: The right may well judge, but not reconcile. Because peace must finally follow a protracted war, concord is most useful, which prevents many ills and prevents future misfortunes, as Claus Narr has advised. 


368 Mag. Nicolaus Hausmann's letter to the Bishop of Meissen. 


(October 16 and 17.) 


(Although this letter is not from Luther himself, it has the content and manner of speech entered by Luther, as Kummer p. 399 (according to Seidemann's information) notes. Since this letter cannot find a place among "Luther's letters", we share it herewith). 


Venerable Father in Christ. Having been called to govern the church in Freiberg, and especially in these very dangerous times, | feel how little | am up to this difficult task. Furthermore, since the Pope may never want to allow a council for the reformation of the church and doctrine, | am urged by my conscience to look around, where | might find advice and help, by which | can be sustained. Since Your Honor has the highest calling in this country and, according to the saying of Paul, should be a steward who gives food to the servants of Christ in due time, | have decided to humbly approach Your Honor with this letter and to ask to the best of my ability whether the Lord might give me grace to show comfort and hope through Your Honor, so that | may be able to govern this church all the more blissfully in confidence in such a great bishop. For although we reject most of the teachings of the pope with the greatest justification and strive to faithfully and sincerely present the Word of God to the servants of Christ, we have never (not even Luther himself) wanted to diminish and abolish the prestige of the bishops; rather, we wish that it not only remain intact and unharmed, but also that it be helpful and comforting, especially in this time, when people are unbridled in all classes, from the highest to the lowest. Therefore, for the sake of Christ, | ask Your Honor to indicate to me what help and consolation | may receive from Your Honor in this matter, so that | may be able to govern with all the more confidence the district entrusted to me. | wish to teach the word purely, to maintain the discipline of the church, to honor the superiors and, as much as God grants, to live for the edification of all, not to give offense to anyone, if only it can be left to me, and at the same time | can obtain help and good will from Your Reverence. | expect a gracious and godly answer 1) in Christ. Your Honor is well. Simonis and Jude (28 October) 1538.

Lauterbach Table On October 17, the honorable man, Mag. Nicolaus Hausmann, a venerable old man speeches 


and faithful servant of Christ, went to his profession in Freiberg and Luther gave him his sis farewell blessing that he should take up this profession in the name of the Lord: Go, my 

dear Mr. Hausmann, God will be with you and comfort you. Do not be broken down, for it 

is not your cause that is being pursued, but Christ's, the Son of GOD. When he said this, 

both of them began to weep, and the tears also flowed from those standing by.

370. when and how Freiberg started. (October 17.) 

In the year of the Lord 1172 Freiberg in Meissen was built by Saxons from Goslar. That is why a part of it is still called the Saxon city, which at that time was still completely a desert, uninhabitable because of the [dense] forests, except that on the bank, which is now called the MUnzbach, there was a very large spot called Christiansdorf, which is located all along the creek. On the height, where St. Peter's church now stands, stood a gallows. Which area all Margrave Otto should have given to the abbot in the Celle. But since at that time wagoners were driving towards Goslar and saw ore on the road, which looked like Goslar ore, they threw it on the wagon safely, which held a lot of silver in the sample. Immediately, some Saxons from Goslar went with the wagoner to the place, mined and struck, found excellent ore, so it became a large supply. Margrave Otto, however, gave Ruspen [Rosswein] to the abbot for this place, and such a large mine was quickly established, which none in the German lands has ever equaled. Those at Jglau in Moravia have given them mining rights, as Wittenberg has taken its university from Tubingen. Thus this city Freiberg had very large liberties, until in the times of the duke George some were taken from it. Has stood 400 years less 34. This told Hausmann to Wittenberg. | advise Hieronymus Schurff, Doctor of Laws at Wittenberg. Igy.

(This advice to the council of a city (Halle?) under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Mamz indicates that, according to Scripture, the fathers and the spiritual rights, a congregation has the right to seek out and choose its own preachers and pastors, and to partake of the Lord's Supper in both forms is also commanded in the same to the laity.

When Luther heard this incident, he was very excited about it and suspected that it must be with herbs 1) that the noblemen and the Saxon captains turned a blind eye. If such a thing happened to the landgrave in Hesse, it would not be given to him. He is a noble prince, keeps his land and street pure, [I] will accept his escort for the escort of all princes and emperors.

November 10. 163. The sun works different things by one drive in different objects; because it dissolves 

everything warm, but it restricts the cold. Thus the one is cold by its property, but warm by 

its power. For there is a double cause, the true and necessary one, which Aristotle calls aitwv

For 2 times 4 makes § 2c. This principle, which can be recognized by reason, is always certain and firm. But the practical one: Honor your parents 2c., is less taken into account. | answer: It is the cause and fault of our corrupt nature, so that our judgment is so darkened that we can see those natural things less. 


395. simplicity of Luther. (November 10.) 165. After that, the teachers said of Luther's perspicacity and spiritual gifts, who could completely recognize the most difficult things before they had even occurred. He answered: Not at all, but he was a very simple man who could easily be deceived; as the nightingale, the simplest of all birds, is easily caught, so also M. Luther is easily deceived. 


396 Community of goods. (November 10.) 165. The community of goods is not according to natural law. It is not something commanded, but left behind. If it were a commandment, it could not be maintained because of the corruption of nature, because there would be more who would consume the goods than would bring them, and so confusion would arise.

They are dealing with misfortune. Let us pray and be pious that we may be concerned with our zeal also for the foreigners, for the duchy of Duke George. It is good that our princes have gone before. 


405 Question about the 32nd Psalm. (November 16.) 

On the way back, Luther asked Jonas how the passage rhymes, Psalm 32, [v. 2]: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no falsity"; how the two passages fit together: He is blessed because he is not imputed, and: 

He is without falsity? D. Jonas answered: This sentence belongs to it [esse propositionem 168. categoricam], namely, such people are sincere and godly, and it is said against them. 


1786 Appendix No. |. 405-410. 


1787 





who drew a carnal freedom from the gospel. Luther answered that this was a godly answer, but it was not in the passage, because this sentence was spoken conditionally [esse propositionem hypotheticam]. The first sentence is: Blessed is the one whom God accepts according to His grace and mercy. The second: and in his spirit there is no falsehood. He must also believe, so it will be comforting for him. Even if he does not believe, God is true; but it is not to his advantage [sed non ill).

409. The Gospel of the Old Testament is interpreted. (November 16.) 

The worship of the New Testament and the religion that has to do with faith is the most certain, which is based on the oral word. For the oral preaching of the Gospel is the most certain and is the explanation of the whole Old Testament, which is still dark, as Revelation 5 indicates the book that is sealed and opened and revealed by the Lamb. The papacy has the most apparent worship, in which it boasts of the Word of God, faith, Christ, sacraments, love, hope, but it denies the power of all these and teaches things that do not belong to it, which contradicts it. That is why Paul says (2 Tim. 3, 5.): "They deny the power of godliness"; he does not say: they have no godliness as far as their life is concerned; he also does not say: they deny godliness, but: they deny the power of godliness, namely by their false and superstitious teaching. 


410. thomas, scotus, occam. (November 17.) 

On November 17, he said much of the Thomists, Scotists, and Novelists [Occam], three sects that struggled with wonderful subtlety over the words that were taken to be essential or significant, as in the example: No one and no one bites the sack, whether no one and no one is taken essentially? as they would have teeth? Likewise: The lewd woman will be a virgin; there the lewd woman is taken from the future and in another sense, namely, the child that is not yet born, which will be a virgin, will be a lewd woman afterwards. Likewise: No man runs; this sentence is true if the men rest, if also all women run, because "None" is of male gender. That is what they are called restriction. Likewise Haeccitas, Oppositio, Suppositio, Alienatio.... All this has come from ignorance in grammar and grammatical figures. Now are very favorable times for all arts and knowledge ffacultatum], which are most clearly presented and learned in a short time, for which we cannot thank God enough. Woe to the young people who abuse this golden time. In the past, the sciences were more splendid in Greece, and nothing in Germany and Italy. For Paris was

The two main errors in the papacy. (November 17.) The following piece of this section: 17! 27, 106. 


Yes, if the devil had as much power as God, then we would see from experience that 172: he would be godless; but God always gives more good than evil, therefore he is found to be just and true in deed. But if we cannot grasp it, then we should exclaim with Paul (Rom. 11, 33.): "O what a depth of riches." This exclamation is the most beautiful and general solution of all God's judgments, and it is good that God has reserved His judgments for Himself. It was said by Bucer, who dined with Luther: When Paul was converted, he said (Acts 9:6), "O Lord, what wilt thou that | should do?" He does not say: What wilt thou do? Luther answered: | would very much like to talk with St. Paul about the high questions of the temptations, what the oydioy [sting] had been, and the angel of Satan, who had attacked him with fists (2 Cor. 12, 7.)? | think it was Lucifer's legate alatere, or his highest cardinal. If we did not have St. Paul with his writings, we would be very poor. That is why St. Paul is not unjustly blasphemed by the papists, as if he were the father of the heretics, and as Dietrich von Speth, that exceedingly godless scoundrel, says quite impudently, there are 1) not greater three boys, because St. Paul, the bishop of Salzburg and Salamanca, these three have caused all misfortune. He would like to erase Paulum and put himself in his place, so that the devil's trinity remains, or let Sadoletum and Petrum Bembum be there.

The Nile always leaks, but it makes fertile the fruit-bearing clods. The Elbe carries only sand with

Glory of the Scribes. (November 20, Wednesday.) On November 20, after the doctors, the chancellor and the vice-chancellor had dined together, M. Bucer went away in the afternoon at the second hour in peace to the landgrave. May God the Lord faithfully guide his message. Amen. Just that day letters arrived from Amberg and the Palatines asking for preachers of the Gospel. After that Luther said: "Behold how God raises the lowly from the lowest. He calls the wretched to deliver messages for the direction of the greatest affairs, because the nobles are not able to do it. The prince uses the scribes, party stallions. Caspar Muller 2) sat on a splendid chariot and said: "We want to be driven splendidly on covered chariots. For they must have us, even if they are of such high nobility. After all, our H.

Lauterbach Table Turbatus est furore oculus. pag. speeches 


(November 25.) 180. Cap. § After that he asked the Hebrew (Aurogallus), what does XXX actually mean? It does not mean anger [furorem], but sadness, as the Psalm says (Ps. 6, 8. 31, 10.): Turbatus est furore oculus meus, i.e. with sadness, as if he wanted to say: Someone might become gray before such hardship. For the word furor obscures the whole verse. Ah, | have often been glad when | have found a word that has illuminated the whole sentence for me. For here the word furor leads our mind to anger, of which the text does not say here. Also in Paul (Eph. 4, 30.) is the same word: Do not grieve the Holy Spirit. 


439. you have dug through my hands. (November 25.) 181. 

They have dug through my hands and feet. (Ps. 22, 17.) This text of Christ being crucified is completely mocked by the Jews, even they say that Christ was not crucified at all, because neither Moses nor the prophets indicate that this kind of torture was used by the Jews, but stoning or burning. To them | reply that the Romans did not kill according to the law of the Jews, but according to the customs of the Gentiles. For to this day men are hanged in Syria, as they are impaled on a stake in Hungary. Therefore, the conclusion of the Jews that Christ was not crucified is not valid, because in Moses we do not read anything about this kind of torture, except the hanging on a wood, but not about the piercing of the hands and feet.

441, greed. (November 25.) 

Great is the covetousness of men, even in the time of the gospel, and they hasten to help no one in his need. Luther answered: "Even if our hearts are not so inclined to give, a Christian must still be mindful of his duty of love, so that he may be glad [to give] because of his duty, just as the spendthrifts waste everything too much, as Seneca says to a prodigal: "You have a disease that you give too gladly. For the prodigal is not to be praised who neglects thrift altogether.

It is good not to eat flesh and not to touch a woman; therefore, it is evil to eat flesh. | answer: The conclusion is false, because there is a deception in the composition and in the division. For it is good not to eat meat, namely, if the brother is vexed thereby. For the good is twofold, a moral and an indifferent. If the good is taken in a moral way, then its opposite is evil. But if it is an indifferent good, then it is not directly opposed to evil. For the rule of the opposite does not apply except to that which is directly opposed.

(November 30.) 183. 


Last November, there was much talk about the armaments of the landgrave, [his] armament order. Luther answered: Our Lord God grant us peace and prevent those warlike armaments, although our princes are not to be greatly blamed; for they are sought so carefully that no treaty nor imperial diet is held, see only if they could get a cause.

It was said of theft that it is not punished so severely among any people as among the Germans and the English. France whips a great thief, if he is caught, with rods, if he is caught the second time, he is made recognizable by cutting off the ears, if caught the third time, he is punished with death. Luther answered: The law of the Lacedemonians is admirable, imitates most the Greeks, because the same permitted the secret theft: That one would like to steal, only that he kept it secretly, that one did not seize him, so that one teaches the people to have respect for their own.

On the 3rd of December | (Lauterbach) asked D. M. Luther, how the two passages in Moses about the death of Aaron could be brought into agreement with each other, because 5 Mos. 10. (V. 6.) it says, Aaron died in Moserah, at the twenty-seventh place of residence, but 4 Mos. 33. (V. 38.), he died on the mountain Hor, the thirty-fourth place of residence. He answered, Aaron died in Moserah, but his body was brought to Hor and buried there.

| also doubt very much whether the Sacrament is in the private Mass, because here the commandment of God about the Sacrament is neglected and they change it into a sacrifice. There they do not celebrate synaxin, i.e. communion, and have a private silence. One alone holds it, which is quite against the word Communion.

When the sacrament is administered, the minister of the church must always communicate at the same time. If someone has a hatred, let him be sorry and be reconciled. If he is not qualified to administer it, he is even less qualified to baptize, to preach, to pray. In the past, the church consisted of a few people and people went to the sacrament very devoutly. Now everyone runs around confused. | always think about how | want to abolish the private communion with the sick in the house, but [we] have to keep it like | did when | was sick, that there would be a communion with several others.

472 The Queen of Navarre very immoral. (December 12.) 189. 

Mention was made of the Queen of Navarre, who once ruled in France. She had her seat in a very high castle, under whose dungeon a river flowed. There she had sent many splendid young men and drowned them after they had been disgraced, so that their fornication would not be revealed. Finally one of them was called by the name of Buridanus. He knew the sad outcome, ordered his comrades to wait for him in barges and pull him out, and so he fell down and was saved. He caught many birds and hung a note on the neck of each of them with this double-meaning sentence: Reginam Navarrae licet occidere [i.e. the queen of Navarre may kill, or: One may kill the queen of Navarre]. 1) Such a murderer is the devil, who makes the people so nonsensical. 


It is uncertain who translated the Psalter. (December 12.) 189. When Luther was asked who the translator of the Psalter was, he said that it was uncertain who had translated it, and that the translation was obscure. When he was then asked to translate it into Latin, he said: "Not at all; | would give everyone an example anda reason to translate it, as M. B[ucer] published the Psalter under the assumed name Aretius Felinus. Thereby he has clearly indicated his bad and hopeful character. 


474, You sell your people for nothing. (December 12.) 


The 44th Psalm was read at dinner. There Luther asked about the verse (13.): Vendidisti populum tuum sine pretio et non erat multitudo in commutationibus eorum, what the meaning of this verse would be, how it could be a sale without a purchase price; if it should be a purchase, then there must necessarily be a value, because sale and price are two related things [correlatival. He said: It is avery obscure translation. Hebrew it means: For ungodliness there is an escape for them, or: for nothing you have saved them. Just as Christ says John 16 (v. 2): Whoever kills you will think he is doing God a service. So in German: You sell your people for nothing and take nothing for it.

Marcus Antonius, a very powerful Roman citizen, mighty over all the kings of Europe, although he was not emperor, was nevertheless a very proud leader of the soldiers, who had a thousand wild pigs served at one meal. When Cleopatra, his second wife, wanted to surpass him in preciousness, she served him, since he was invited, only one dish and swallowed even at the table a pearl, which exceeded in value a prince's treasure. For with great harshness he repudiated his former wife, the daughter of Augustus, and married Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, who was equal to Antony in courtliness. Afterwards he told of the pride of Antony, who had made the queen the queen of Egypt.

This concludes the diary of Mag. Anton Lauterbach about the year 1538. Then Seidemann leaves an appendix of 11 pages, partly written by the same hand as in the book, partly by another hand. The last 7 pages are individual pieces from Kummer's second part. From this appendix, which we do not want to reproduce in its entirety, because what it contains does not fit our purpose, e.g. a fragment of a letter from Luther to Melanchthon from April 8, 1540; a letter from Melanchthon to the Nuremberg bookseller Petrejus, etc., we have included the following pieces in the table speeches:

In addition, Seidemann added a number of pieces from Kummer in the form of annotations to Lauterbach's notes, sixteen of which we have used for the table speeches. We do not consider it necessary to give a list of them, because they are scattered back and forth in Seidemann's edition, there is no internal connection between them, and they are accounted for in every passage in the Tischreden.

2. a teacher (which | would like to have) God did not make, but He wants a speaker. 2) 

All spiritual sins go against the sanctification of the name of God, as when one thinks he worships God as a saint, yet he deals in false religion, or does works according to the statutes of men, or affirms false things with an oath to God, or teaches false things by the words of the 


devil, and boasts and swears that he teaches the truth of God. But it is not the same with bodily sins. For the robber who kills, or the debauchee who commits adultery, does not sin in this way, but follows the inclination of his flesh. 

It is certain that a great change in all things occurs as often as the pure word is preached again after it has been rejected or polluted for a while, as after the deliverance of the Jews from Babylonian captivity, the change and desolation of the Babylonian empire followed; after the gospel was preached from Zion, Jerusalem perished; after the word of God was preached in Rome, Rome ceased to be Rome. What else can the Germans expect, who hear the word of God and despise it? 

The pope has also ceased to be wise, for it is a folly that he tries to deceive under the appearance of religion, which all men understand to be a deception of the devil. That he tries to fortify his kingdom by force is a similar folly, because he is not able to do so. 

(6) It is by reading that the word has remained under the ministry, not by preaching; for in the pulpits the text of the gospel has always been spoken, and it is certain that by this some have been saved. For it is the Holy Spirit with the word of Christ who makes it alive when he wills and in whom he wills.

The true and proper goal, says Solomon in the so-called "Ecclesiastes", is: Let it go as it goes, because it wants to go as it goes. 

It is my sincere opinion that there are more noblemen in the countryside and rulers in the cities of Duke George who are heartily favorable to the truth of the gospel than among our Elector. Likewise, as far as despisers and persecutors are concerned, | think there are fewer of them there than among us. 

Doctor Lazarus Spengler from Nuremberg is the only one who introduced the gospel in Nuremberg, and so far he alone has managed to keep it there. 

Although the right is somewhat on your side, a Christian must avoid an evil example in every way. 

In the prophecy of Lichtenstein [Lichtenberger], the monk who has the devil standing on his shoulders with his hands stretched against his head is undoubtedly Luther. Now, since a certain pope had interpreted this to mean that all his teaching and life would be of the devil, Philipp Melanchthon, the right

Brother [Luther's], this is by no means to be understood in this way, but rather it means repulsions which Luther suffers from the papists, in that the devil drives them, and this is indicated by the feet of the devil standing on them, with which he kicks Luther, and by the hands with which he hits the head or pulls the hair.

God has decreed that all men shall eat their bread by the sweat of their brow, and He has decreed that whoever does not want this sweat shall be forced to suffer the sweat of an evil conscience. And since God has decreed this as a punishment, the devil also decrees it this way, but for the sake of avarice.

The bishops would rather perish in a pleasant way in the name of the devil than be saved and remain in the name of the Lord. For if they would counsel for general and particular peace as we do, they would remain in their goods according to the body, and be blessed according to the soul. 





These verses are in the title: De foro Competent, and are without doubt against the papists: Composito late fetenti, quaeso, ciba te, Qui putas exclusum crimen per temporis usum 


(i.e. Feed yourself with a widely malodorous dish, you who think that a wrong becomes right through the length of time). That is, he who thinks that an evil becomes good by lapse of time, or asin becomes a virtue by age, let him eat dirt.

Campanus writes "against all" (that is the title of his book), but not against himself, as he believes. But he writes more against himself than against all. 

Martin Cellarius claimed against me in all ways that my profession was greater than that of the apostles. People of that kind are vain and proud. But they call this their innate pride and malice, which has become even stronger in their minds through their presumption, plerophoria and certainty of the Holy Spirit. 

Fish belong in the water, a thief to the gallows, the devil to hell. Therefore, no one should help them, for that is where they belong. 

When he came to the small town of Kahla by order of the prince to admonish Carlstadt and the other iconoclasts, they had placed here and there hands, feet and the head of a large image, a crucifix, around the preaching chair on which Luther had to climb when he wanted to preach. Although he was very upset about this impertinence, he did not mention it with a single word, but preached with conciliatory words about the need to carry one's cross and to obey the princes. 

Afterwards, since | [Cordatus] was sure that he would not have kept silent out of fear of those people, and asked him for what reason he would have wanted to keep silent, he answered that it was pride against pride, and their very hopeful spirit, which was diabolical, should have been thus repaid like with like. 

The noblest jewel of a city is when it knows that the prince wants it well, and to know that it does not have a gracious lord is its greatest evil. 

The right of those who sit there [4 Cor. 14:30], of which my new friends are now writing, is that they speak and | remain silent. But that they say | never wanted to suffer this right, so | experienced it differently ten years ago [at Worms] in such a large crowd of contradictors. Furthermore, let the emperor say, and let the pope answer, whether | have not endured the right of those who sit there.

If he [God] had not preserved the Bible for us through his great mercy, it would undoubtedly have long perished at the instigation of the devil, so much is he hostile to it, and not without cause, since he has also heard the papists in the churches cry out this verse: "The Lord spoke to my Lord," and has certainly understood from this that he will one day inflict upon it the harm that it is now experiencing.

All the enthusiasts with whom | have had conversations have attacked me with the greatest 


and most presumptuous audacity. In addition, one takes the greatest certainty, which, however, has finally become easily disgraced. Thus, of all of them, Marcus attacked me first, who answered me when | finally asked him to desist from his presumption: GOD Himself shall not take away my teaching. When | finally demanded a sign from him, he said that | would get enough signs to see. From this | did not yet suspect the evil of the peasants’ revolt, because | spoke to him simply and sincerely, and therefore | said to him: "My God will probably forbid your God that you do not do a sign. And since he had said, among other outrageous words, that he could immediately recognize people at first sight in such a way that he could also reveal to them the thoughts of their hearts, | challenged him to reveal the thoughts of my heart. To this he immediately answered boldly: | now move this in my heart that his teaching is true. Since | denied that this was true, | did not want to tell him then what | thought, although he asked for it if he did not return tomorrow. When he returned, | told him what was the case, because | had these words of Zechariah [3:2] in mind: The Lord rebuke thee, thou Satan 2c. 

A short time later, Nicolaus Storck, his Zwickau master, came to me. When | told him this about Marcus, he replied that Marcus must speak as he [Storck] wished. This Storck laughed very much at the idea that a handful of water should make people blessed, and | did nothing with him by saying that this water was powerful enough to bring about blessedness, because God's word was connected with it, which would bless and bring it about. 

After these came the pupil of both, Minzer. How proud he was, and how arrogant in his teaching, no one can say. 

After him came a certain turner, a child of Marcus, who said, "My father sent me to you. And | said unto him, Who is thy father? He answered, God; and | said, He also is my father, so we are brothers. Now what message do you bring from our common father? That God was very angry with the world, for he had seen, he said, a great house in which many revelers were sitting. God stood by them and threatened them with two fingers. From this vision his message was revealed to him. | said that | had known this before, but if he had something new and special [privatum] to tell me, he would like to say it; from the whole of the

It is known in the Scriptures that God is angry with the world. Then he went away angry, because | despised his fine admonition. 

But | believe that | have endured about sixty of such people, and | have seen that all their proud doctrine has been rejected and perished like the dust of the earth, just as Carlstadt's [doctrine], who always wanted in every way that we should all submit to his doctrine. We certainly could not do that. Otherwise, willing to serve him with my body and fortune, which he strove for with equal zeal, | certainly would not have refused him, but | did not want to obey his teaching because | was not allowed to, and as far as my teaching is concerned, | say with Christ: My teaching is not mine, but His who sent me. Therefore | cannot profane him, as the world desires. Thus | am exercised by the ungodliness of the devil's servants, and the proud blasphemy of Campanus cannot challenge me. That will also fall in a short time, and he will come to his place. 

Our God is such a God, who does not care about the strong, yes, he rejects it and works on the weak. That is why it is easier for him (if | may speak of God in this way) to convert man in his infancy than for us old people, who are drowned in the devil's kingdom.

Just as the Jews, after three days, forgot the misfortune they had endured in Egypt and, according to their passions and desires, would rather be in it again than endure in the wilderness according to God's will, so do our satiated listeners and those who have forgotten the burdens that pressed them under the papacy. One also finds such people who would rather live under the papacy than in the freedom of Christ. 

Muenzer, Carlstadt, Campanus and people of the like are inveterate devils, for they direct their thoughts to nothing but harm and revenge, and as such people dare and presume more than can be said at the time and in a place of peace, so at the time of danger they find themselves 


more fearful than a man can believe. This | have experienced. | have seen a frightening example of this fear in Carlstadt. When he lived in my house for more than eight weeks at the time of his expulsion, and no one knew about it, our Elector came to us across the Elbe bridge. He went to the window and in my presence he looked out towards the bridge through a broken triangle [triangular window pane], which was under the window panes, which were otherwise all whole, but immediately he went away. When | asked him why he was leaving, he answered, pale and trembling, "So that he would not be seen by anyone. Of course, | thought that the falling leaf, of which Moses speaks [3 Mos. 26, 36.], reminds of a cause for fear, however small it may be, but the enthusiasts are immediately afraid, where there is no cause for fear at all. 

The illness of the spirit, which is called sadness, and death are siblings and children with each other. Yes, Jesus Sirach 1) says [80, 25] that many die from sadness, and that there is no benefit in it. In German there is a very beautiful saying against it: Guter Muth ist halber Leib.

| [Cordatus] had written these words in my pocket book [in tabulas meas]: Luther [said] to Philippus: "You are an orator in writing, but not in speaking," because | liked the sincerity of both the speaker and the hearer, who wanted to persuade Melanchthon's Luther that he should not answer again to the book which the pastor in Cologne [Arnoldi] had published, whom Luther calls the assassin of Dresden Masers. But what | had written did not please Philip. Therefore he demanded my pocket book from me and often repeated this request, because | used to write in it what | had heard. Finally | gave it to him, and after he had read a little, he wrote this distich in it: 

Omnia non prodest, Cordate, inscribere chartis, Sed quaedam tacitum dissimulare decet.

The doctor, however, never said a single word that he disliked what | was doing. Yes, | prepared the way for others to dare the same, especially Veit Dietrich and Johannes Schlaginhaufen [Turbicida], whose lumps (I hope) | will unite with mine. The whole crowd of the godly will be grateful to me. | wanted to add this because | was very upset by the poetry of Philip. But now nobody imitates us. Furthermore, if someone copies it against my will, let him copy it only with such a heart as | have written it, namely a simple-minded and pure one, and let him praise Luther's words with me more than the oracles of Apollo, the words | say, not only the serious and theological, but also the seemingly entertaining and insignificant ones. 






The world regime is either presided over by a few or by many, and yet, if God does not preside over it, it is neither well administered by a few nor by many. 

The tragedy represents the royal life, and the comedy the civil or private one. The latter begins with the highest majesty and ends with the utmost misfortune, but the latter has a sad beginning, a middle full of anguish, but a calm and cheerful end. Not different is the life and death of the kings, the citizens and the peasants. The rich man does not want to die, and the poor man desires death. 

139. the right of the sitters is not that you attack the teacher or the preaching pastor in a hostile way, let alone that it is right to despise them, but it is a friendly union in love over a word of God which you think can be argued about. 1)

The moral teaching of Aristotle [Ethicorum] and the book which we call "Ecclesiastes" [Ecclesiastes] have the same doctrine, (only) that Aristotle measured the respectability of life according to what the best reason prescribes, but the "Preacher Solomon" according to the keeping of the commandments of God. Furthermore, if someone had said to Aristotle: "Don't you see that everything you write about the respectability of life has no continuation if it is to be carried out in life, just as what you teach about housekeeping and the rule of the world does not? Aristotle would answer that he sees this and almost despairs of men and equally of doctrine and the prestige of government, because men despise punishment as well as doctrine. But the "Preacher Solomon" would answer: Do what you do diligently, be it with teaching or negating. If men do not obey you, do not cease to do what is your duty, and: Let go 2c. 

In all creatures we see a kind of image of our death and resurrection, because in winter everything seems to be dead, but in summer it seems to live. Yes, even in individual things both are perceived. For all things hear in some measure, and in some measure they live. Thus the age of the youth is a foreshadowing of the resurrection, but that of the old people denotes death. 

Such great promises as we see in the Scriptures prove most strongly that this is by far the greatest thing that the devil and the world inflict on the believing man, otherwise this supreme Lord would not take on us so vehemently with His promises.

160 The Sophists have this theological rule that man can earn grace by purely natural powers [ex puris naturalibus], and they have expressed it by this little verse: Ultra posse viri non vult Deus ulla requiri. 


[God does not want anything to be demanded that is beyond man's ability]. But they are seized here as transgressors and untruthful people, as in all other things. For what is spoken of the world's regime and of the household, and that well [spoken], they have drawn to spiritual things. Furthermore, that it is said: Let it go as it goes 2c., belongs to "Ecclesiastes Solomon", and is a saying, which appropriately says, that if someone in his office or in his housekeeping takes care of his things diligently, but still cannot do what he wants, he should say: Let it go 2c. 


161 When | asked [Cordatus] what the lust of the eye was, he answered that it would not be necessary to carry water into the Elbe if it were not completely dry; but he added that it is written that the eye is not satiated by sight [Eccl. 1:8].

Zwingli does not want a world regiment, but he wants an aristocracy. But governing is not in brooding, but in practice, since we see that even the best-ordered kingdoms are overthrown and fall. 


The Ten Commandments are the source of all laws. Duty is the practice of virtue, as each one should observe. Where there is a school and disputation, there are also sects. 

The Peripatetics were so called from walking about, because Aristotle taught in walking about, as we do in sitting; the Stoics from the Stoa, which is a vault or hallway under which they taught. The latter were more polite and taught very good things according to reason; the latter were harder and coarser, as the Franciscans and Carthusians are with us, although both placed the highest good in virtue. Furthermore, they claimed that there were some middle good things [media bona], e. g. the Life, good health, which the Stoics denied. The third were the Academicians, who did not differ much from both. They were so called from a building near Athens in which they taught. The Epicureans, however, said that pleasure was the highest good that pleased and did good to everyone. They made a distinction, however, that some pleasures were according to the soul, others according to the body. This sect mocked the Cyrenians, and so surrendered to the pleasure of the body that they said it was no good but feasting and humbling. 

Death is the least of all evils, and it is the so-called natural order, except for those who fear it, just as the law is not a law except for those who are under the law. Thus the comet that now shines in 1531 in the month of August is a comet only for those who see it. 


Reason slandered the words of the tax collector and said they were unjust, for it said that a sinner is worthy of punishment, not mercy. But the words of the Pharisee it seizes as holy, mostly because he has lived as he speaks and has done these works, since God commands them by the law.

The Italians call Pope Clement the Seventh the Wisdom of the World, because of his excellent experience in all the cunning of this world, and the Pope must be truly of such a nature, that is, so excellent above all, that he is inferior in wickedness to no one in the world. The fourfold thing he intends, | recognized before the Diet of Augsburg was assembled. First, that under the pretext of the Lutherans, whom he wanted dead, he wanted to free Italy from the presence of the emperor and in some way send him to Germany for his benefit. Second, if the Emperor did not want to kill the Lutherans, he saw a future opportunity to start a new conspiracy with the King of France and the Venetians, which has now happened. Thirdly, if he does not succeed in this, he will start a war against the emperor with the help of a very large treasure which he has and of which he, as a cautious man, has not wanted to make use until now, since he realizes that one should not start such a difficult matter too hastily. Fourthly, even if this war should not be at all happy, he will prefer to associate himself with Turks, Tartars and all the most godless knaves than with the truth, with which he will never be satisfied. For the pope is of the devil; on the side of the lies alone must the popes stand. Furthermore, how much and what he wanted and still wants above all else, he has never been able to accomplish and will never accomplish, namely, that he wanted to make sects among us. Furthermore, his master, the devil, was finally able to do this, but he was able to do it because of our excessive security, satiety and ingratitude. 

This certainly happened in turn, except for the war in which he himself was defeated and took Rome. For the (pope) who followed him, | don't know his name, is said to have summoned the Turk, who devastated Austria again this year. Furthermore, we have never had stronger false brothers than in this year. Incompetent people are now philosophizing about the article of justification; their leader is Philipp Melanchthon.

Preachers, parents, or rulers 2) should only consider that God lets his work go on, and that he does not care at all, that one needs (the work), 2) as he wants, as the sun shines over good and evil, and the grain grows in the same way for all. Even a lewd woman gives birth to her bastard just as an honorable woman gives birth to her son. But God bears this abuse, meanwhile He does not cease to be a just judge, and this time, of which it is written: some will go into life, others into eternal fire, is always present with Him. 

176 | cannot tell you with how great joy | was filled when | found the right use of the sacraments in the papacy, just as | found the right use of the sacraments in the priesthood. 





1) The last paragraph is to be regarded as an addition by Cordatus. The sharp words against Melanchthon refer to a bitter dispute of Cordatus with Melanchthon from August 1536 to July 1537 about the doctrine of justification. By the incompetent people (caussariis) are meant especially Cruciger and Jonas. Toward the end of 1537, this dispute ceased altogether because Luther silenced Cordatus. How? is not known.

| cannot attain with words how much | have labored to be righteous. But now this worry of mine has completely ceased, after | have realized and believed that before God another wants to be righteous for me. 


God has reserved three things for Himself: judgment, vengeance and glory. For to the first belongs a perfect righteousness, which is in God alone. Therefore, to hold authority [i.e. to judge] is his [God's] alone. Secondly, a perfect power is necessary, power to punish and to help. The third is only due to the one who is perfectly good, but only God is good. But since these three things are granted to the authorities and parents by the order of God, it is proper that we obey them with all reverence; whoever does not do so, contradicts God's order 2c. 13, 42. 73, 3. 


The whole way of preaching or rhetoric is to divide, explain, summarize or conclude. If you want to preach about faith, you must distinguish between the faith that is among men and that which is from God. Then you must explain the justifying faith. Third, it is necessary to summarize that only the justifying faith in Christ justifies. 

Just as all those who teach the youth well first instruct their students to read Virgil and Cicero most carefully, and then others, not only to read and learn them, but also to evaluate them, so also he who wants to do theology in a profitable way should read John and Paul, but the Fathers and all those who wrote after the Evangelists and Apostles should be read and evaluated. 2, 52. 27, 44.

The parable of Paul in the letter to the Romans 7 [2-6] is not as easy as some believe. But there are four terms init: a physical man and a woman, a spiritual man and a woman. In the first marriage (that | say so) the man dies and the surviving woman shall be free, in the second the man lives and the woman dies, who nevertheless shall be free by her death and marries another 2c. But he wanted to connect with this equality an inequality {dissimilitudinem], because the law remains in the flesh. 

The science has to do with the particular and individual, but the astronomy has to do only with the general. If a boy is born only in this star and becomes a farmer, he will excel; but if he should become a fisherman, or anything else, he will excel [also].

The first purification in the kingdom of Christ is that of the conscience, the second is civil and concerns civil matters. Up to now we have advised the consciences, now, God willing, we will have to deal with the civil things of which the church has need, namely, that the pastors and church servants have their livelihood 2c. That is why the visitation has begun. 

197. Is not the ‘holy Christian faith contrary to the Lord's Prayer? For in the latter it is said that the church is holy, but in the latter we ask for forgiveness of sins. But this knot is untied by the fact that one man is, as it were, two men, the inward man, who is holy by faith, and the outward man, who is a sinner because of the flesh. Add to this that in the Christian faith we confess that the sins are forgiven, which we ask for in the Lord's Prayer. 


199. forgiveness of sins comes from God, who works it [effective], through faith it gains form {formaliter] [in us], further from the sacraments, which are means for the forgiveness of sins, as the instrument [instru- mentaliter].

Where Moses appears to be smallest, there he is largest, namely when he speaks of things; but where he appears to be largest, there he is smallest, namely when he writes laws.

Of this it is written: GOD aroused the spirit of the Medes and [Ps. 76, 13.]: "Terrible is he that taketh away the courage of princes." 

Sharp questions and equally [accurate] answers must be made flesh and blood to carnal 


people, for with coarse people one must speak coarsely and answer [coarsely]. 


Since we and the saints use the word of God together, and both parts boast of the correct interpretation, it may seem very doubtful from where one should be certain. 

The testimony of the Holy Spirit inwardly, outwardly the agreement with the brethren, makes us certain of the doctrine that we must adhere to the Lutheran part, not the Zwinglian. 

The reason of Augustine in the place where he says: "I did not believe the Gospel" 2c. is this: | believe the general church, not the Arians; but this cannot be valid, because likewise the Papists could say that they find nothing of Luther in the Scriptures.

qualis, quanta]. If | were to write a dialectic, | would treat only the second and take out of the categories [praedicabilibus] only one particular, so that if | had to preach about chastity, | would explain it first; then | would speak of its advantages, thirdly of its disadvantages. 

It is not probable that the ancestors of the Jews were so nonsensical that they would have seriously meant the fables they invented, which their descendants do. For what is more foolish than to consider as true what they invented about their Shophor [i.e. Shor-Habbar - bull of the field]? It is an ox and so big that it grazes every night all the grasses from the pastures of the whole world, which God makes grow again by the nightly dew. | believe, however, that those wise people mainly illustrated to their children the death that takes away people of both sexes and of every age every day, in that God puts other people in their place, as when | am taken away from that great ox, my son and daughter are put in my place for me; when they are taken away, others will also follow them. But that they add that that ox will be slain at the last day, and every man will eat his piece of roast from it, signifies that death, which kills us, shall be slain, and die in respect of every one of us, that he may no more hurt any man, for he shall be cast down at our feet. This is how | understand the fable of the largest fish of the sea, called Leviathan, with whom God plays three hours every day, that it is the devil, whom God allows to trouble people, but whom God restrains when he wants. But the fact that a movement of his tail brings about a movement of the earth means a very great confusion which he causes in the world. 

Since no one can in all ways do what he wants, nor do what we certainly should do, let each one do what he can in his office and say: "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed," 2c. as when the emperor wants to settle the disputes of Germany and the Germans do not want to. We would like Carl to believe the Gospel, but Carl does not want to. We have nothing more than to pray a blessed and dear Our Father, and let it go as it goes 2c. 

As God creates everything from nothing, so He brings everything back to nothing. For what was Alexander the Great? Nothing, before he was. What is he now? Nothing at all. This is how God does it in the rebirth. For before He makes you a new man, that is, frees you from your impurity, into which you have come through the corruption of nature, it is necessary that you first become nothing. For God makes you nothing through the atonement and then something through faith. 

No one denies that private affairs belong to private men, therefore the schools, the maintenance of the church servants and priests, and the like, which are public affairs, will not be given to a private man, but to the authorities. A peasant may give a penny for confession and a piece of bread, but he will not give the whole neighborhood to feed the priest or keep his house in repair, for these are works of majesty, not of the peasants. 1) 

1) In praise and honor of God, we must note here that here in America, citizens and farmers, who in our republic are, however, also co-rulers of the country, build and maintain both churches and schools (lower and higher), feed and pay preachers and teachers, and even provide students and pupils at all higher educational institutions with housing and food. This is done for all religious 


denominations, because the authorities do not care about religion at all, just as in Germany the Jews maintain their church system themselves.

217 If the universities [universales scholae] were not maintained at the expense of the princes, people would soon see that private citizens do not take care to promote public studies. 

Whoever wants to study theology and achieve something, let him be a fool and he will be a theologian. The highest art of a future theologian is to distinguish very carefully between the wisdom of reason and the word, or the science of God. For those who mix the two, mix heaven with earth. 

The best pope [and therefore the worst man] of all in the past time was Julius [Il.), but in our time, who will also surpass the best [popes) of all times, the best pope is this Clement the Seventh, because he is the worst [man) among all who have ever been, and by far the worst. In addition, he is also a bastard. And the pontificate does not belong to any other men than the very worst. For the papacy cannot suffer a divine government, which is the word of God, over itself, nor the world regiment, nor the house regiment, but a certain middle one among these, that is, a purely diabolical [regiment]. That is why only the devil's real sons can preside over it. And if by chance a good man is placed before him, he still becomes evil by the nature of this realm; of which a frightening example was Leo X, who before was a very good man 2c. 

The world is not governed by religion, but by superstition and tyranny, and not by equity, because the world is under the teusel, and since we preach that faith makes free, and the world hears this, it wants to be free in every way, but in a carnal way. Thus it turns the true religion into superstition or rather into the lie of the devil. 

In spiritual things there is only one cause and one end; as God's word has God as its cause, but justification as its end. But the sinner, who is the matter, is the thing with which it has to do [causa circa quam]. But if one assumes in spiritual things a material and formal cause in the proper sense of the word, this can only be done by an equation, but not actually. The formal cause in the word is wisdom, truth, virtue, these are invisible formae, they are recognized only by their effects [effectibus]. 1) 

The first epistle to Timothy is intended to be the right method of Christian teaching, for it speaks first of the law, then of the gospel, as Paul mentions it himself. Thirdly, he comes to the practice of faith; such is the prayer for the kings [1 Tim. 2, 2. ff.). 

223. It is a positive law [given by men] and indeed of great importance for the world, but the natural law is greater, but the greatest is the law of divine and eternal wisdom. But above all is the law of grace,

Thus our repentance and our efforts Wnatns] are causes of justification, without which it cannot happen [sine qnidns non]. In the course of the dispute that now began, it turned out that these words came from Melanchthon, whose Dictates Cruciger had used. Now the dispute flared up with Melanchthon himself.

which may [easily] be more depressing than inspiring. 1) Furthermore, | would like to see someone who could actually distinguish between the natural law and the divine law. Also the ceremonies are from the natural law, because the ceremonies are also ordered for the sake of the divine service 2c. 


The third commandment is about worship, ceremonies and the law of God. 


The law is the law, even the law of God; whether it concerns morality, or judicial procedure, or ceremonies, all laws bind the conscience in the same way. But how is it that they have said that only the ceremonial law is abrogated? Who will free us from the others? We must fulfill them, say those lovely people. 

226 On the nature of the peacock. - The peacock boasts and struts in a wonderful way with the richness of its feathers. But when he looks at his feet, he immediately begins to scream and lets his feathers hang down in fright. He is also said to be very jealous and envious, as Aristotle testifies. Besides, he has a hoarse and unpleasant voice. 

The peacock is an image of heretics and swarm spirits, for they too are proud in the manner of the peacock and boast about their gifts, which are never substantial, but if they could look at their feet, that is, the foundation of their teaching, they would lower their feathers in fright and humble themselves. Yes, they also suffer from jealousy because they cannot stand pure and right teachers. They want to be all alone and suffer no one beside them, and are jealous beyond measure, like peacocks. Finally, they have a hoarse and unpleasant voice, that is, their teaching is harsh and sad to the sorrowful and godly people, for it depresses the consciences more than it straightens and strengthens them. 

? 227. another simile- how the peacock passes through the 

beauty of its feathers attracts the eyes of passers-by, the doctrines of the heretics have a great appearance among the great multitude, and deceive and delude the hearts of inexperienced and simple-minded people, either by teaching new things, or what is contrary to the reason of men. 


228. of the nature of the crows. - The crows are said to be very loveless [atrropfoc]. For they immediately leave their hatched young and fly away, and God feeds them wonderfully thereafter, Psalm 147, [9.]. 

By the crows are depicted the false and unfaithful teachers and pastors of the church, who leave their young, that is, the Christians who are entrusted to their care, either because of the belly or because of the danger, but Christ Himself feeds them wonderfully afterwards and preserves them in the midst of the wolves, as it happened under the papacy, where God has preserved His own wonderfully above all comprehension of human reason, so that they were not deceived by human statutes. 

229. of the nature of the heron or $ wood. - The nature of the heron is wonderful. For when he has settled down in a river, he shall stand motionless on his feet. Then the little fishes swim up, attracted by the smell or the sweetness of the feet, and stay with him. Afterwards he catches and devours them, and as the heron brings a pious behavior as a witness, so the sin brings with it an evil conscience. 


1) These words might be understood from Tishr. chap. 13, 15: It is extremely difficult for a man to believe that God is gracious to him.

The essence of sin is depicted in this bird, which lures people to itself with unbelievable loveliness and certainty, and subsequently brings the lured to ruin. 


231 Of the eagle. - It is said that the male eagle leads his young, if they are not yet fledged, into the desire and exposes them to the rays of the sun. When he sees that they keep their eyeball immobile against the rays of the sun, he recognizes them as his own, in that the sun is, as it were, a witness that he is their true father. He shall not only fight with the smaller four-footed animals, but also with the deer. He sits down on their horns, throws a lot of dust into their eyes, which he has collected on his flight, and hits their faces with his feathers. He also fights with the dragon. The dragon is viciously greedy for the eagle's eggs, so the eagle attacks him wherever he sees him. The dragon, however, ties up his wings with many twists, so that sometimes they both go down at the same time. 


The scholastics said that he who does as much as is in him lives well morally, deserves grace de congruo, but not according to the mathematical, but according to the physical, that is, a divisible means [medio]. 1) If they had spoken this of righteousness before the world, it would have been beautiful. Furthermore, God simply demands righteousness according to the mathematical means, because He is simply and completely righteous, therefore He does not consider anyone righteous if he is not completely righteous, and who (like God) cannot suffer sin completely. 

Physics is about the movement of things, but mathematics is about their quidditas and their forms. But one must speak of Christ neither according to mathematics nor according to physics, but rather what his benefit is, what he has brought us 2c. 

The fact that we do not serve our neighbors according to our wealth is the reason why the rich want to increase their wealth, so that they spend much of their pleasure on their bellies, buildings and games. Wealth, and holiness even more, make people mad and so foolish that they do not serve their neighbors, even that they do not know who their neighbor is. Where can one find a bishop now, who is on alms? When have elders and monks done what their rule requires, according to which they called themselves holy? This holiness does not let them see Lazarus lying at the door. 

Holiness, wealth, wisdom, power prevent people from loving God and their neighbor. And yet they are all great evangelicals. People dare to say that about them, and God remains silent. You have to let it go, because the more you rebuke them, the more they will be inclined to do what you rebuke, to defy us; let it [i.e. stay with that] that we rebuke them. But when | preach the word of God, you do not defy me, and | will be undaunted, | know that well. [We must suffer these things, and from the multitude also look to the little flock that is obedient to the gospel. The Lord will find the wicked in his time. 

(236) Christians must exercise their faith by abstaining from sins, which is the performance of good deeds, so that our profession (as Peter teaches [2 Ep. 1:10]) may become stronger and more certain from works. But through sins it becomes weaker and finally ceases altogether. From good deeds we gain the testimony of faith, but from evil deeds we gain the certain testimony that we have sinned against the law.

267 Doctor Brick mentioned this as the last words at the Diet of Augsburg, when the Prince of Saxony wanted to leave and had heard that those who had confessed Christ would be threatened with all hardships: Well, if it cannot be otherwise, we know that all the gates of hell are useless against this doctrine of ours. Since the emperor did not understand what these "gates of hell" were, he asked about them. Namely, the judges of religion and the protectors of faith have such insight. 

In my time there was absolutely no use of dialectics in the schools, but they only recited it with poor general words and categories, and although they argued about them terribly, they did not recognize any use. But |, when | want to preach, still do not think about the categories. When | have to speak of faith, | do not think about its greatness, quality, or essence, but | first consider where it comes from, or what is its causative cause, that is, the Holy Spirit, that it is a gift of God, which is bestowed through the ministry of the Word (which is the active cause). After that | consider the formal and the material cause that he takes hold of Christ. Then | also consider the final purpose, which faith gives us, namely righteousness, and likewise what it gives to God, namely glory. 2c.' Here | also consider the fruits of faith: good works, thanksgiving for such great benefits, which are offered to us through Christ; then | carefully separate this faith from that which is called historical and from other things, so that no ambiguity remains. Such a consideration opens up to me the whole essence of faith, which | could never arrive at through the categories, and in this way it is more easily and simply understood and learned by children and others. But one can also explain faith and other things that have to be preached through the categories, if one has noticed them in such a way that one can simply speak out of them what one wants or what one has to preach. The knowledge of the causes, however, is more excellent, for it is finely straightforward when one wants to speak of things in terms of what they are. 

By the abundant and immeasurable mercy of the Lord, we easily recognize the immense wickedness of men, who with the greatest ingratitude despise everything that He gives them without ceasing.

In this year 1531, the soil had borne all too abundantly, for no one could have rightful profit in such great abundance, but in the past years everyone complained about the so very small yield of the soil. 

Markolf rightly indicates that at every court there must be an excellently insolent and foolish 


man, who does not obey the prince, but seeks his own, as at our court Ritese 1)) is. He also implies that the wisdom of the world is not so great that it cannot be mocked or ridiculed, or even drivel. His poem, however, is quite suitable for the Germans, because the Germans, when they come out as poets, always have the dirt and the butt in the mouth. 

The law of nature is implanted in us as heat is in fire, and is in us as fire is in pebbles. Its use, however, is such as one makes of the mirror. But it cannot be separated from the divine law. 

331 The sophists said that it is not necessary that all understand the faith clearly [expiicite], but veiled [implicite], that is to say, it is The understanding of Scripture is not necessary for everyone, by which one disputes against the heretics, but it is sufficient that one holds the concept of salvation from one or the other passage of Scripture. 

It is in vain that God has the gospel preached to the world, for men abuse it, and yet it must 


be preached. For in no other way can it be taught to the world than with this mischievousness, that he [God] lets the law be preached to the world, and when the law is preached, he secretly creeps into some people through the gospel after the preaching of the law. 

The Holy Spirit must rule the Church, otherwise it is impossible for all flesh to rule the Church; but when the papists arrogated this rule to themselves, to what an abuse has it come! Namely, they have come to call the conspiracy, which was made when a few bishops at a council thought more wrongly than any man can suffer, the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, from which then finally flowed the rule of the Church. 

Hans Metsch is my enemy and | am his enemy, not because he does or has done evil to me, but because he wants to be and be called a Christian and yet does evil against me and others. Let him give out this [Christian] name 2) and let us not only offer our hands to his kicks, but let us also offer him our whole body, so that he will trample it underfoot, especially since he is in public office. 

As the Turk rules with the rod of iron, so the rule of the pope is by the lie, and as both are earthly regiments of the world, so both are certainly of the devil. 

Through repentance Christ receives people in all positions of life, however glorious and holy they may be in the eyes of the world, so that he may show the world through the preaching of faith what he wants all people to do, namely, believe. These two things are inseparable companions in a godly man, otherwise they are separated from each other. For Judas was repentant, but not believing, and all who misuse the gospel now most certainly believe that they are believers, since they are not repentant.

As repentance in the name of Christ abhors all life as evil, so faith seizes with the most willing heart the best [life] that comes from the Word. 

In the year 1483 |, Martin Luther, was born of my father Johannes Luther and my mother Margaretha. 1) My fatherland was Eisleben. My father died in the thirtieth year [i.e. 1530], my mother, named Margaretha, in the thirtieth year. In 1517 | began to write against the pope. In the year '18, Doctor Staupitz absolved me from obedience to the Order, and left me alone in Augsburg, where | was summoned before the Emperor Maximilian and the Pope's legate, who was there at the time. In the year '18 (cf. No. 569) | was expelled from the communion of the Church by Pope Leo and thus absolved [from obedience to the Roman Church] for the second time. In the year '21 Emperor Carl expelled me from his kingdom, and so | was absolved for the third time, but the Lord received me.

And these follow one another, or exert their effect. Namely, in the time of safety and peace, presumption, disputing (against the known truth) and hardening prevail, but in the time of fear and tribulation, the other three, despair, envy and impenitence. 

For in the time of security the wicked is confident and presumptuous, and it seems certain to him that his works please God, and he simply wants to be righteously fine, as the Pharisees constantly want. This is the presumption. When they are rebuked by someone, they become proud and resist the truth that is held out to them, and although they know that it is the truth, they do not want to let go of their presumption. Therefore, this presumption is followed by arguing against the recognized truth. If they do not give up this, they will become so hardened in presumption and in arguing that they will die in their sins, hardened, angry and incorrigible, like Emser and his like, who used my writings and yet disputed my writings until they died. 

The reverse is the case with the other three, and at the time when someone begins to feel the wrath of God, like Cain and Judas. These first despair and do not trust that their sins will be forgiven; they believe that they are greater than the forgiving mercy of God. Afterwards, when they see that they are rejected, they envy all men their salvation and want no one to be saved, and all sin with them. They remain obstinate in their envy and despair and do not allow repentance, and as obstinacy is a kind of impenitence to the end in the time of certainty, that is, in presumption and strife, so impenitence to the end is a kind of obstinacy in the time of fear, that is, in despair and envy.

Just as no one is to be forced into the faith and the gospel, so it is not to be permitted under one and the same authority that they secretly blaspheme the word of God, but they are to be summoned so that they may hear and be heard, so that plantations of sedition are not cultivated. With their serpentine hissing they flee the light, therefore they must be dragged before the public, so that they may win, be defeated, or by force 2) remain silent. 

Since the Ten Commandments also teach what belongs to the worldly regime and to the household, the people are to be forced by the authorities to attend the Catechism sermon, which must take place very frequently. Whether people believe the gospel or not, obedience is necessary for all of them, which they owe in the worldly regime and in the household. And those who want to live among a people must learn their way of life and customs, yes, even the catechism, if not for their own sake, then for the sake of their children and their servants.

According to the Cordatus, No. 365 at the beginning, and No. 366 at the end, these two numbers do not seem too far from Luther. But because Rebenstock II, 39 a.-406. and Bindseil Il, 40-43 communicate the former number in much more detail, the latter in excerpts under the heading: "Wie man mit Schwarmern umgehen soll, Unterricht D. Martin Luthers an den Herrn fd. i. Pfarrers Johannes Mantel in Mihlhausen", we have translated both numbers. The latter is found m dm Tischreden Cap. Il, § 12. See our note there. We leave the former here: 


The Sacramentarians must first be persuaded (says Philip) that they are not pissed in their opinion, although they have some probable reasons. Therefore they are to be questioned in familiar conversation what they could oppose us. Then the faith of the ancient fathers is to be held against them, of Augustine, Cyprian, Hilarius, whose opinion of the Sacrament is clear, and that of Augustine on infant baptism. If they confess that they are uncertain, then they are to be seriously admonished that they should not teach anything uncertain, but keep their opinion to themselves; it is a sin, because what does not come from faith 2c. 

This is the way to study successfully in theology, that you read some chapters in the Bible at the time (loco) of prayer, early in the morning and in the evening. After that, the method of the Christian faith is to be learned from Paul's letter to the Romans and the letter to the Galatians, and when you have familiarized yourself with the letter to the Colossians, you will easily understand all the others, as Paul teaches afterwards. Then read the Gospel of Matthew and Luke, and consider the passages in which Christ speaks of repentance or faith. Thirdly, the sermons of Christ in the Gospel of John are to be read. Then one must go back to the Old Testament, and especially to the first and fifth books of Moses and the Psalter, whose teaching is to be connected with the teaching of Christ. All this is then understood all the more correctly when an application in life is added and the challenge which teaches to pray. Afterwards the prophets are to be read, and their words are to be directed to the doctrines of the Christian faith, faith, love, the cross 2c. In the stories of the Law, a distinction must be made between the Law and the Gospel, between faith and works, the faith of David 2c. The teachers, he said, are to be read with (good) judgment, that they may be tested wherein they are sound and wherein they are wanting. 

In the whole doctrine of the Church, careful attention must be paid to which part actually belongs to the spiritual life, and which to the civil and political. These two parts must be kept far apart from the Gospel, which is the power of God for salvation; but those are only good things created by God [creaturae].

If Pa's conscience is certain that Christ instituted the Lord's Supper in both forms, it is not at the discretion of men to take it in one or both forms. And if it is not permitted under both forms, it is safer and better to abstain from it altogether, for this is done without sin, because it is not in our power, but we are deprived of a form, and in the meantime the spiritual enjoyment must suffice, of which Augustine says: Believe and you have enjoyed it. Further, it is not lawful to take it secretly, because Christ has ordained that it should be taken publicly. For this sacrament is a public confession of Christ, since he says: "Do this in remembrance of me. But if thou wilt take it in any other parish than thine, and shalt be accused of it, see that thou

This must be remembered without ceasing. This is the commandment of God, as He says there (in Scripture) in the 12th Cap. [v. 13.[ of Ecclesiastes, and about this David complains in the 131st Psalm [v. 1.], that he was ill at ease, as often as he searched after high things. And this causes the devil, so that we should finally hate GOD and despair. Secondly, | search diligently in which commandment of God these thoughts of mine are contained, and if | find none, then | say: "Lift yourself up, you wretched devil, you want to teach me to take care of myself," 4) since God commands in the first commandment and elsewhere: "Cast your care upon the Lord" (1 Pet. 5, 7.). Third, if the devil does not soon cease, | must not cease to constantly turn my heart elsewhere and speak to Satan: Do you not hear that | regard thoughts as your thoughts, and that God has forbidden them? But if you want to argue about these things, go up to heaven, and God will answer you abundantly enough. Fourthly, when | speak of those fiery

So skillful are those who go against the word of God in speech and writing, that they will not let themselves be taken until they open their mouths. 

In the way of righteousness, that is, in the kingdom of heaven, the Christian sees nothing but faith and grace. In the world, however, he is thoroughly concerned about good works, so that he may take care to live honestly and uprightly, and so it happens that faith belongs to heaven and good works to earth.

When Cordatus left for Torgau 2) to the prince's councilors, who were to pass judgment on the Zwickau affair, Philip said: "Dear Cordatus, | wish you an unusual patience.

490: "Before the arrows that fly by day" [Ps. 91:6]. The sum of this verse is, be it night or day, be it black or white, there shall be no trouble with thee. Therefore, let it be well or ill with a Christian, let it all be one to him, for nothing will harm him, let the sun shine brightly or darkly. This is a general comfort in this one verse: thou shalt not be afraid of those who counsel in secret, nor of those who break out against thee. It makes us safe against the deceits of men and against the violence of tyrants. 

The Psalms and passages of Scripture do not have to be drawn to private life, as Bernhard has forced "the arrows that fly" [Ps. 91] to the vain glory by a moral and monkish interpretation; for it [the Psalm] concerns the Church and the forgiveness of sins. There lies God's power.

The Italians, Spaniards and French did nothing at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, except that they rode around on their donkeys, so that they could greet the emperor on occasion, and they hunted along frighteningly. But the Landgrave was held in very great honor, and the people who followed him proved that there was something captivating [fatale] in this prince. 


The world does not believe and recognize the hidden treasure of God; it cannot be persuaded that an obedient maidservant, a faithfully working servant and a woman who gives birth is much more glorious than a praying monk, who is only concerned with his appearance, but those [see 1) the command and order of God.

The opinion of many is that the world will stand for six thousand years and there would be 400 years left from the year 1532. But God is beginning to rumble, and it is to be hoped that He will shorten the time, as the Law of Moses was given before the passage of time. For this decade seems to be a new time, as it were, because tremendous changes are taking place. The Pabst falls from year to year, and everything changes. It cannot last long if there is not a new pontiff. Therefore, we must watch spiritually in faith and physically through good behavior, so that we will be found ready. Afterwards, watchfulness will not be necessary.

Although all men are without God [athei], they have in themselves the consciousness of evil and the reward of good; therefore they take care. The papists impudently claim everything without Scripture. Peter is the highest of the apostles, so the pope has the right to give laws and issue statutes. See, here are two swords, so the emperor must receive the fief from the pope. Thus they are nonsensical, mainly to the ruin of the secular authorities, who are saved by laws. For if the laws had not existed before the canons, the emperor would have long since perished. So the pagans defend the emperor by their law against the pope of the Christians, Scavola, Ulpian 2c., which were before the Code [Justinian]. If the pope had no power, he could not give laws, as now the priests can not give laws, because they have no power.

There are so many treacheries and deceitfulness, disobedience and secret hatred among the nobles and great men, that no one can settle them but the holy father, the Turk, and we must make peace.

The papists preached the suffering of Christ in three ways. First, the preachers martyred themselves, second, the listeners, third, Christ, because even though they talked endlessly, they never touched the benefit of Christ's suffering, and to cause emotion was their work and the suffering of the listeners.

Augustine in the book "De civitate Dei" gives, as it were, an ex ly over Horace, Tibull, and Properce; for he enumerates so many vices of the Romans and of the heathen, also so many idols.

He has been the best interpreter of the Scriptures above all others.

Origen neglects the faith and treats only moral teachings, as in the letter to the Hebrews, where he speaks of the priesthood. He praises the elders and brings up a lot about their dignity. He left me in the mud when | started to interpret this letter trusting in him, just as Jerome deceived me. The Hypognosticon and the Controversy with the Pelagians are the best books in Augustine. The former [Jerome] has written twelve books on Genesis, since he has not explained half a chapter of this book. Furthermore, Augustine is condemned to Paris because he spoke excessively spitefully against the heretics, that is, he expressed a dissenting opinion without intending to do - so, for example, when he said that free will in itself has no capacity other than to sin. The same opinion is also Magister Sententiarum [Petrus Lombardus], who was a very good man and by his way of teaching wanted to prevent the too great amount of books and writings, but created an even greater one. 


681 Occam, Magister meus, was a very great dialecucus, oberer did not have the gift of speech. He was so condemned in Paris that in a hundred years no one dared even to call him, but now he reigns there completely. 

There are two kinds of theologians, namely men who deal with conscience, William of Paris and Gerson, and speculative (theologians), Thomas, Scotus, Occam, Alexander 2c.

724 The priests would have undoubtedly persisted in the gospel, if not for the shameful monks, because they had the sacraments of the church, the burial, good songs, one of which is "Come, Holy Spirit [HErre GOtt"], which is beautiful and delicious 1), and many other things.

747: What a man will not allow to be punished, God will not allow to go unpunished. This happened to a nobleman of Grefendorf. Since he had violated a respectable woman under the promise of marriage, and then extorted a thousand guilders from her, he went with many of his companions to hold the betrothal feast with a noble maiden; And since a large number of guests had gathered in the house, he called one of his servants, rode out into the field, and since he often told the servant that he saw many horsemen coming against him, and after he had sent the servant away from him, he ran into a bog (gemof3), and since he had once begun to feel the worm of conscience, his evil in the meantime increased until he stabbed himself. After that, when the servant, who had returned to the others, had brought news of this, they searched for him and received from the half-dead man the ring, which he had taken off and sent back to the violated woman. Thus this great despiser of our preaching perished. 


748 Since | was invited to Pommer, | heard various stories from Philip, especially about the Brandenburg margraves, that they had always been princes of very high talent and eloquence.

Namely, when the Bishop of Halle (Albrecht, Margrave of Brandenburg) becomes a Christian. 

749 The fact that there is an enormous number of whores in Libeck was deduced from the fact that more wine is sold in one evening during Fastnacht ([fastInacht]) than for 600 marks, but after the gospel is accepted, only for four guilders.

When our prince and head will pass away, 2) he will undoubtedly take many councils with him.

The duke is like all the nobles at court, but the prince is the servant. They have the use, feast and command, the prince has the work. Since Frederick did not want this, he had castles instead of great captains ([capitaneis], otherwise, he said, others would have the benefit, | the name. A captain costs me two thousand, | can endure a castle with two hundred (guilders). 

Ritesel 1) is very faithful and very familiar with the elder prince. Now, after he died, he experiences all hatred and what it means to trust in princes, and what, to trust in God alone. 

Nothing keeps me better from dizziness than a small gift [offula} of 6 spoons early in the morning. A butter is a healthy thing, and | consider that the Saxons are strong people of butter, which they eat very much. Lavender water is a very good thing, and black caraway, soaked for two nights in good wine, is a good remedy for dizziness. 

760 The Christians borrowed the celebration of death from the pagans, but they far surpassed the pagans in the quantity and splendor of the ceremonies at their deaths. 2) 

The noblest in the world are not favorable to the gospel, as can be seen in Flanders and the regions of Lower Germany, where there are very solid cities, where the merchants serve only idols, and avarice and Venus rule. 





770 The generosity of the elder prince John was wonderful, which can be seen from this example: Since he had given me 200 florins a year, he said that he would give them freely, not on account or out of consideration for any work. After that, what | do with reading, writing, preaching, | do for free, because | am bound to no one but the prince. But the printers [chalcographi] bring me under their command in every way, they are very ungrateful people. | have had so much trouble with the translating that no one with favor nor money should be able to make me sell a book, if | had not done it for the glory of Christ, my Lord. But those ungrateful beasts would not have given even one copy to those who helped me. Fie on you, shall it not grieve us? Therefore, | do not want D. Creutziger do anything without pay. 

Hesse is a very good country because it cannot be conquered due to lack and hunger "because the enemy would die of hunger in it. 

772 H(archduke) G(eorg) is not of Saxon blood, but a bastard, and does not have the majesty of the Saxon princes. He is a very ambitious man, who is said to have said: What is a prince of Saxony better than a bastard, if he is not Churfiirst? 2c.

775 As the translation of the Bibles has made me a great deal of work, so this work will be of great benefit to those who want to derive benefit from it. For the old translation was darkness. But the world, all and all, is also ungrateful. But my head is unaccustomed to thanksgiving, and if there is one who gives thanks, it is a great, wonderful thing. 


The old dialecticians ascribed it [dialectic] to the intellect, but rhetoric to the will, and had summarized dialectic with the best rules, but they did not have the matter and the substance. | used to think that dialectics was only in books and disputations and did not extend to all kinds of things and dealings. And even today | would have a sermon ready twenty times as quickly and easily as | could bring it into the dialectical rules, although our Philip testifies that | explain and divide according to dialectics.

If | had to argue with a sacramentarian, | would have to stop the dialectic. First, | would have to explain to him what a sacrament is.

788 However great and proud the pope was a short time ago, he is now so low that he crawls on the ground, so that he asks even the least for help and protection. For he already calls upon the King of Scotland [Jacob, and has sent him a crown, which would have been too low for him before times; has often sent him letters, because he sees that the Emperor and the Englishman are not at all reliable patrons for him. And this is a just consequence for his arrogance, out of which the Cardinal [Cajetan] once said at Augsburg: "What do you mean that the Pope is asking for Germany? Now he has to suffer me, a poor monk, in marriage with a nun, whom | act and live almost under no one's protection. For what is our Elector against the whole realm?

796 A practical question posed at Heidelberg: | ask whether a donkey with its long ears, clothed in a buckskin, sitting on a king's throne, and gnawing on hypothetical foliage, can be absolved by a simple priest? 1) 

A scolding [joke] can turn into seriousness. This happened to Pommer, who stood with some women who accused Mag. F[résche] of an immodest sermon against them and the virgins. When | excused him in jest, Pommer, together with the women, began to become very angry. It happened similarly when, in the presence of D. Jonas and Spalatin, D. Briick jokingly said that he had something he wanted to say to them, but that they had to promise beforehand that they did not want to be angered. When they had promised this, he said that the prince demanded of them that they wanted to suffer, that their wives be their concubines before the world, otherwise - the Elector could not defend this cause. Spalatin then immediately asked: "Fie, fie, death, death, shall | thus provide for my dear wife, the poor little child? Immediately Jonas said the same. And Philip added to the joke that they could let it go, because otherwise they would be freed from many burdens of the pope. What harm is there in that, dear sirs, if you also indulge my most gracious lord? Jonas said that something similar has often happened, namely that the jokers are finally provoked to anger. 


In 799 the pope is said to have sent his envoys to the emperor, admonishing him not to hurry with the conciliation, or if it had to be held, to deal only with articles of faith, but not with the primacy of the pope. 45, 72.

1) This number probably follows the previous one and would then refer to King Henry VIII of England. The stretching in the buckskin is an allusion to the king's love of women, the gnawing on the hypothetical foliage an allusion to the king's scholastic erudition and writing. Under the priest Luther would perhaps be understood, since the latter desired the expert opinion of the Wittenberg University in his marriage deal.

Thus he demands thorough study of the Scriptures, corrected Bible text, yes, he speaks out more freely about food commandments, marriage, use of the vernacular and many other things, so that he incurred fierce attacks from the Sorbonne and the Dominican Ambrosius Catharinus and others. It is mentioned that the editors of his writings had to soften objectionable passages. (Wrampelmeyer.)

An evil conscience betrays itself. Example: A certain monk used to sprinkle a lewd woman, whom he kept secretly in his cell, with fragrant water often at night. She wanted to do the same when the monk was at early mass, but took the ink [encaustum] instead of the fragrant water, which was used up. When he came, he thought it was the devil, cried out loudly in fear, and summoned the whole monastery.

The world is the devil, and the devil is the world. Therefore Christ must quarrel with them forever, and neither can keep peace with the other, he not with Christ, nor Christ with him. 

907 What an inconsistent breed of people the papists were, is proven by a certain collegiate 2) in Erfurt, who had never left the city. Once, when he had hired a carter for the journey to Wittenberg, and had driven a short distance, he asked how much further the road was that was left. The wagoner answered: A hundred times as far. Then he immediately ordered the wagoner to turn around and returned home, of course miserably martyred by the length of the way.

H[archduke] G[eorg] is caught by the very good writings of the Pabst, the Cardinal, the King of France, England 2c., and by ambition he becomes so puffed up that he thinks himself as it were their god.

He is a completely rustic man; indeed, without ceasing, he pursues honor and property, and he is disgraced for it, as if from Friesland. 2) 






The Duke George is a spark, and the whole world is the tinder. Yes, a conflagration can easily arise if we do not pray. In the year 32, on Michaelmas, he expelled 14 citizens from Leipzig and 11 from Oschatz for the sake of the Gospel. All of them went away with the greatest joy.

If we could not perceive otherwise that God is a wonderful artist, we would certainly see it from the so many-colored formation of the birds. 

The disobedience of the peasants is unspeakable, therefore they should be forced most severely by orders and laws, and it would not be good that the rejoicing had ceased. The devil could enjoy that of the peasants, if they do not have to do it.

All prophets make general things out of the particular, or common things out of particular cases. And all histories of faith are general and yet taken from particular cases.

976 It is not possible for one to speak his native tongue with another tongue, and the way of translating is not to seek the word too near, nor too far, but to take it quite properly according to each language. 

977 Jesus Sirach is now translated in such a way that | do not know it, compared to the old translation. For in the Greek and Latin the book has been very corrupted. If we take the Hebrew, we leave the Greek and Latin. 

So you have to talk like you talk in the market. That is why the textbooks, the philosophical and thoughtful (sententiosi) books are difficult to translate, the historical ones are easy to translate. If | had to translate Moses now, | would probably make him German, because | wanted to take away his Hebrew way of speaking, and that in such a way that nobody should say that Moses is Hebrew. 

979 To translate rightly is to adapt what is said in another language to one's own language. But since we do this with all effort in Moses, the Jews say: The opinion he has troffen, but the words 1) not. For when they say: They have banished the city by the mouth of the sword, we translate: They have devastated the city by the edge of the sword, and the likeness of those words fits the preachers, who devastate everything with their mouth; but in German it is as if one said: They strike everything to death that only lives. 


1) In the original: "the true". Because Rebenftock Il, 198 and Bindseil II, 212 agree on the more appropriate reading "the words", we have adopted the same.

995 Interpretation is certainly an art. For often we cannot translate the understood meaning appropriately; for it is true what Amsdorf once said: It is a shame that he often understands something and yet cannot speak of it. Yes, we often have to pour it into four barrels before we can get it right. For who can express this sentence in Jesus Sirach (32:14) as it should be? Sicut fulgur praecedit tonitrui, ita verecundiam praecedit gratia (As lightning precedes thunder, so favor precedes shame). In my judgment, it is better to say: verecundia praecedit gratiam (Shame precedes favor). Who can translate the word verecundia?* 


996 Verecundia (Shyness out of respect, shamefacedness, bashfulness, stupidity, modesty, modesty) is a very great virtue among young people. Verecundus, honorable, who reveres all; on the other hand, honorable, who is worthy of all honors. | often have to reject a good word when translating it, that | would rather lose a red guilder than this word, because no matter how well chosen a word may be, it sometimes does not fit the meaning.

A presbyter made his sin very great to a soldier who had confessed that he had killed four people unjustly, and now thinking that he had made him all contrite, the latter said, Ah, dear Lord, | have also made four other people this year. 15, 17., Against his adversaries David was righteous, but against God he was a very great sinner; indeed, somewhere [Ps. 7:9] he calls upon God to judge his righteousness. Against God we act with the dear Lord's Prayer, there he wants to forgive gladly, but against the devil and the opponents of faith he speaks mockingly. They have no right to him, per se, but it is different when God allows them!

Those are very miserable who are not satisfied with their fate. Of these really wretched people there are many at the courts who seek more money or honor at court, since they have plenty at home. 

In the first book of Moses, one must consider what and when God speaks, and what effect follows this word, or what the godly or the godless do when the word is spoken. Otherwise, everything will seem ridiculous to you. 

The histories in the Bible are examples of faith. For example, the Exodus from Egypt is a history and an example of great faith. One must judge the others in the same way.

1071 There are different types of lies, which are well distinguished 


must: Ridiculous lies, lies of duty, pernicious, ungodly lies. 1) Joke lies, ridiculous antics, are those by which one amuses the sad. The lie of duty is a work of love, as it happened when Abraham saved his wife by pretending she was his sister, and when Michal saved David [1 Sam. 19, 14-17]. So also 2 Kings 6, [19.] 2c. Thus a certain pastor said to the executioners who were searching in his house for a thief who had fled there, "I will not lie, nor will | betray the thief," and they were forced to desist from the investigation. An ungodly lie is one by which we blaspheme God and men. If a man ever wants to tell a white lie, he should say badly, No, he should not add an oath; he should not say, Truly, truly. Also Christ Joh. 7, (8. 10? did not lie about his going to Jerusalem, otherwise he spoke mockingly, as when he said (Joh. 8, 7?: Let him who is without sin cast the first stone at the adulteress.

Someone has published an interpretation of the letter to the Hebrews, who uses dainty words, but does not know what Christ is, what faith is, can only wash. But in this letter, as the subject of which it deals, the knowledge of Christ should be treated, which is faith. Philosophers are not theologians, therefore Paul reminds us not in vain [Col. 2, 8] that we should beware of philosophy, that is, of all philosophy, because such a one has nothing but words of human wisdom, which certainly cannot agree with the Gospel and therefore cannot agree with it. 1122 A thing is learned more easily by imitating speech than by studying and from books; this can be seen in my little daughter [Magdalena]. Although she is not yet four years old, she can speak very well and quite understandably about household matters.

It is said that the emperor and the pope, now in agreement, pray that God deliver the innocent Carl from the bloodthirsty pope, whose counsels all flow with blood. If the emperor were to fall away from him, he would be immediately humiliated. It is also said that the King of France will fall away from him, the Englishman has now fallen away. Ferdinand would certainly not defend him, because he equally fights the gospel and deprives the papacy. But he is a good protector of the pope, because he, like the pope, has an evil conscience. | hope, however, that within five years the Pope will call on the Lutherans to help him against his patrons. 

The Lutherans are very good and benevolent heretics because we have defended the papacy until now. If we had not prevented it, the papists themselves would have already devoured the papacy, and | have not attacked the papacy, but the papacy has attacked the gospel, which, by fighting the gospel, fights itself down. [The] pope could not keep peace. When an apple ripens, it must fall, even if it has enough room on the tree. Thus the papacy has fallen according to its own counsel. 

It would have been an astonishing and intolerable tyranny in the papacy, if the consciences of the people, deceived by the false merits, had not kept it voluntarily. For a monk or a nun who picked only one leaf in the garden was condemned without leniency, even if they had otherwise kept the whole rule. But the freedom of the gospel is despised or abused. Therefore, the world is worthy of such laws of the pope. 





1184. Although David was an adulterer, he boasts that he did all of God's will, namely in public affairs. For he waged all wars according to the command and will of God. Likewise, it [David's boasting] is also understood of private matters, not of the precepts of the holy ten commandments. For example, this is also understood [in this way], since He [God] says [1 Sam. 16, 12. 13. Acts 13, 22.], "| will choose me a king according to my heart," since God rejected Saul because he had not slain King Amalek. Nevertheless, David was an adulterer and a murderer.

1200 God grant His grace that this present visitation [1532-1535] may progress better than the first [1527-1530], in which almost nothing was done for the Word and the church servants, but only the ecclesiastical goods were gathered [i.e. ordered], so that the nobles, burghers and peasants would not snatch everything for themselves.

The fact that many people take offense at the wisdom of God, that is, at the Gospel, and that reason is not enlightened in all, is because we should recognize and honor the gifts of God, and it is necessary that our powers be put to shame. It is also not to be wondered at that one sees abuse and godlessness in many people, because this also takes place in other creatures. For iron is a good creature of God. But people misuse it more for warfare and killing than for the promotion of peace and work. Thus, the wisest are usually the most wicked and the fewest good. 16, 10. Il, 25.

But wrestling with death, he said: "It serves me right, because | should be a hunter, not a scribe.

He had a cup of water in the cellar, drank wine and filled his cheeks with water again, and testified that he had come to this deception, driven by his master.

1240. Since | (Cordatus) once said that all Italians were surprised that the Germans could be so long-lived with such great drunkenness, (Luther answered,) to him this seems to be the reason that when one urged the other to drink the same, he always said: God blesses you for that. But it is God alone who is not mocked, even though there are so many who mock Him. 

1241: That parents do not want to address their son with "You" [singularite] once he has become a priest, is proven by the papists from the saying of David [Ps. 110, 1]: "The Lord spoke to my Lord. A similar story is told of a certain mother who had her son carried to school on Gregory's Day and said: "Here (in school) | will have such a hard time that | will have to call my son "Her". This wisdom was not less than that which that proof has in itself. 


1242 In Scripture, melancholy is nothing other than inveterate sadness and the sting of the devil, by which we are plagued here and there. That is why they are diligently resisted in the Scriptures. Therefore he (God) says: Believe in me, cast your care on the Lord, do not be sad, let me take care of you, use me and my creature and you will be happy 2c. 70, 2. 


The science is the knowledge itself, but the art applies the same, means [Luc. 10, 28.]: Do this, and vou will live. 22, 147. 51. 13: 


1247 Martinus means a soldier, Philip a horseman, Elizabeth the rest, Magdalena a tower, Peter is a whimsical name. If | had to die at this hour, | would not recommend anything else to my friends but that they 


should be most diligent in the word of God after my death. For since we must seek first God's kingdom, when we die we must not worry about our wives and children. That will come to pass 

which follows (Matth. 6, 33.): "All these things will fall to you." For, if He acknowledges us as His servants, GOD will not forsake us. If He will not abandon us, how will He forget ours? But we are 

his servants, because we (administer) his baptism, gospel, Lord's Supper, preach obedience to 

parents and authorities, and commend all that comes from his word and institution alone. Even if 

we are sinners and do not fulfill our service, we know how to cover the forgiveness of sins.

1250. When | had answered (Michael) Stiefel to his invented calculation, which he called a prophecy, and had refuted his reasons, or rather his opinion of the seventh angel, which he wanted to be, and had signed me in my letter: "Martinus Luther, D.", he made me out of the one letter "D.". Dele, Delere enim me vis (eradicate, because you want to destroy me), so graciously | have Satan. 1) 





1) These last words are perhaps also still to be seen as Stiefel's words, because in the Tischreden Cap. 37, 8144, we are told that Luther says: "Throughout my life, no adversary has given me such evil words as he has, although the preceding Latin words without the conclusion would also be coarse and evil enough, since in them he wishes Luther's downfall. Luther wishes for the downfall.

3, 1 According to the way of the Scriptures, Moses makes the words of Adam to Cain [Gen. 4] words of God, as it is the custom in the prophets everywhere, when they say: "This is the word of the Lord.

1) The meaning of this piece will probably be this: Just as the body is not well cared for by excessive eating, neither is everything well cared for by much governing. With regard to the body, remember what the Gospel teaches on Invocavit Sunday (Matt. 4:4): "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that passes through the mouth of God." Fasting, in God's name, also nourishes. Letting go, in God's name, also often reigns well.

The papists certainly cannot boast of the religion of the Christians, since they deny its * supreme principle and secret, namely faith. Thus Cochlaeus and his like go against the content of the whole Scripture, and he says thus: God, Christ and his Spirit justifies, therefore faith does not justify alone. But even if he listed several more, they would not justify without faith.

The pope and his followers have confessed, as has the emperor, that we are not heretics, and that what we confess and teach is the word of God. Therefore, whatever they do, they do against themselves and their conscience, so it will not end well with them.

1430 General prophecy, which speaks of things to come without specifying persons, places and times, is prescribed by Scripture. Thus every Christian prophesies destruction to the wicked, salvation to the righteous, the change of kingdoms, nations and things. The godless do not have this prophecy, but they prophesy the opposite to themselves and to all the godly. Therefore they build their house on the sand. (Matth. 7, 26.? 2c. But the prophets had the special prophecy about a certain place 2c., as of Christ, Cyrus, Israel. 5, 13.

59, I. 






To fight in judgment [Matth. 5, 40] is what Christ says against 1) the carnal faith of the apostles and the Jews, who expected a worldly kingdom of Christ. Thus he says that one should not wield the sword. You are not to be princes, not judges, not warriors, not authorities, which the Jews believe belongs to them alone; you are not to attack anyone, but to endure suffering that is inflicted on you. | want to have pious people, but | do not want to start a new world regiment; | do not want you to abolish the authorities, that is, to subject them to you. 


1436 In one and the same person the Christian and the citizen [politicus] are to be carefully distinguished. The Christian has no relation to the world regime as a neighbor has to another, a citizen to another. If a neighbor does me harm, | will suffer it as much as | am concerned, but because | have sworn to the authorities, | will pursue the violated obedience with justice, not out of revenge, but out of love for peace, as servants report to the master the evil done by another servant, so that they do him no harm, but, grieved at the wickedness, seek to prevent the harm; so Joseph also reported everything to his father. So also, since he [Christ] forbids the gathering of treasures, he does not forbid this to the authorities, nor to the parents, but only they should not believe that this is their duty, that they have treasures. Otherwise, all the patriarchs would have perished (if they had not gathered treasure?. 2). 


1437. 1 Cor. 6, [7.]: "It is already a fault among you that you judge with one another", Paul does not attack the judgment, but the fault of the heart, that one brother dragged the other before the worldly judgment, namely before the enemies of the faith. For to call upon the law and to seek a livelihood he does not forbid, otherwise it would not be lawful even for a lord to snatch a lamb from a wolf. They sought to avenge themselves, they sought to put the brother to shame. But it is the opinion of this text that we are not driven by revenge or lust, but by justice and need, to call upon the judge for help. 3)

1451 In Bologna, a young man was dragged before the judge because he had done violence to a woman, and was finally sentenced to a large fine. The judge said to the young man: "For my sake, you may take the money from the woman by force. Since he could not wrest it from her in any way in view of the council, the judge gave another "verdict in his favor, and ordered that the money be given back to him, saying: "You were able to keep the money, why did you not keep your chastity? For the young man had denied the crime, and the judge did not believe that violence could be done to a woman against her will. 

Where you are not master, let each one go, do, and make as he pleases. Deal with him the less, or you will gain nothing but disfavor, wasted effort and worry.

1456 At the Diet of Augsburg, the citizens of Schweinfurt are offered an honorable opportunity, but they do not want to make use of it. That is why this very hard saying applies to them: Fronte capillata posthaec occasio calva [One must seize the opportunity by the scoop, because behind it is bare) and Virgil: Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque [futurae Aen. X, 501. The human mind does not know the fate and what will occur in the future]. So we must also dare on both sides, if they also speak: You are of the devil. 2) 


1457 Let the papists start, who boast that they have the church. The Jews also boasted that they were the people of God. But Christ, on the other hand, says: | am the Son of GOD.

The devil, our bitterest enemy, is always plotting evil against us. All tyrants' counsels are his. He has hanged the Sacramentarians and the Anabaptists; through the pope he will still accomplish something, as that beast [the papal legate Aleander] said at Worms: "If you shake off the papal yoke, Germany will flow with blood. He is now up to something with the French and Venetians. We weak people have no weapons but prayer. Let us take hold of it, and all wickedness will fall on his own head. God will defend his honor. Since He was able to uproot the Roman Empire when it was in bloom, He will probably be able to either preserve or destroy its tail in our time. 

When someone promised him a remedy for his illnesses, he answered: "If you would let me make a remedy against the devil, who now beats me with his fists on the outside, because he is already satisfied with my insides.

Trust, believe, call, pray, lament 2c., the matter is to be taken from the most distinguished words. For even though the Psalms are different, they are to be judged from these words and preached and prayed from them in the same way.

The Holy Spirit punishes the world for sin, which it does not acknowledge, and assigns righteousness to Christ alone. Against this the whole world rebels with its power, holiness and judgment; for it does not want its unbelief to be its sin, nor does it suffer with equanimity that its righteousness should be rejected and Christ alone exalted. Therefore the world is punished by the Holy Spirit. Therefore he [Christ] says: That "the prince of this world" is judged, which must be referred to the first two pieces. But the teusel must be taken here according to the category of the relation with his whole kingdom and efficacy, because according to his essence [secundum praedicamentum substantiae] he is judged before, but now through the gospel also his power.

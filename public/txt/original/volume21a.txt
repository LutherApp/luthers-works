Foreword. 


The volume in which Walch published the 
letters of Luther known to him was published in 
1749, more than 150 years ago. Since then, this 
epistolary literature has experienced such an 
increase that it has not been possible to include 
the newly discovered letters in one volume in 
addition to the existing ones. There were now two 
ways open to us, in order to counteract this 
unfortunate state of affairs: 

First. We were able to print in one volume the 
material offered by Walch, revised of course, and 
in asecond, a supplementary volume, the writings 





that have become accessible so far; and no one 
could have complained about the division into two 
volumes, because, according to the original plan 
of our edition, it was not intended to increase 
Walch's, but only to revise it. 

Secondly. We were able to insert the newly 
added material into the already existing material in 
a suitable place, and thus produce a_few, 
chronologically ordered letters collection, which, 





however, had to be distributed over two buildings 
because of its large volume. 





The choice could not be difficult for us, and so 
we have divided the twenty-first volume into two 
sections, which, however, receive consecutive 
pagination and consecutive numbers. 

The most important collections of Luther's 
letters, which appeared after Walch, namely those 
of D. Gottfried Schitze, "Martin Luthers bisher 
ungedruckte Briefe", 3 volumes, Leipzig 1780 and 
1781, 8th, furthermore: Karl Faber, "D. Martin 
Luthers Briefe an Albrecht, Herzog von Preufen", 
from the originals in the secret archive at 
K6nigsberg. Konigsberg 1811, 8th, and the D. 
Mar- tini Lutheri Epistolae, studio et opera b. edited 
by Christoph Ranner. G. Th. Strobelii, Past. olim 
Woehr- densis, collecta. Norimberg. 1814, 8., 
marked as Strobel-Ranner, have already been 
used in the work, which has the title: "Dr. Martin 
Luthers Briefe, Sendschreiben und Bedenken, 
vollstandig aus den verschiedenen Ausgaben 
seiner Werke und Briefe, aus andern Buchern und 
noch unbenutzten Handschriften gesammelt, 
kritisch und historisch bearbeitet von Dr. Wilhelm 
Martin Leberecht de Wette, Pro- 





Vi 


fessor of theology at Basel." 5 vols, Berlin 1825 to 
1828, 8. To this has been added a sixth volume: 
"Die in den flnf Theilen [De Wette's] fehlenden 
Briefe und Bedenken Luthers nebst zwei 
Registern. Collected, edited, and published using 


de Wette's estate by Lic. theol. Johann Karl 





Seidemann, pastor at Eschdorf near Dresden." 
Berlin 1856, 8. 

After De Wette's edition, a reprint of Luther's 

German letters from De Wette first appeared in the 
so-called Erlanger Ausgabe der Werke Luthers: 
"Deutsche Briefe. After the oldest editions critically 
and historically edited by D. J. K. Irmischer." 
Frankfurt a. M. and Erlangen, 4 volumes, 1853 and 
1854. This collection is a mere reprint, without all 
self-activity, without all criticism, with retention of 
all De Wette's errors, for incorrect letters, incorrect 
readings, incorrect punctuation, incorrect time 
determinations, incorrect superscriptions, incorrect 
proofs are retained with the greatest fidelity, while 
De Wetter's indications of content are omitted; 
hence it is of no value to us, with the exception of 
the second supplement to the 56th volume. The 
first volume of the book is the first volume of the 
book, but it has already been included by 
Seidemann in De Wette, vol. VI, and therefore 
does not provide us with any information. 
Since then Seidemann published his Lutherbriefe 
in 1859, Burkhardt_in 1866 "Dr. Martin Luthers 
Briefwechsel" and Kolde in 1883 the Analecta 
Luthe 





Foreword. 


rana, which will be discussed below. 


The latest edition of Luther's letters, which is 
"Dr. 
Briefwechsel. Edited and annotated by Dr. th. 


still being published, is: Martin Luthers 
Ernst_Ludwig Enders, pastor at Oberrad near 
Frankfurt am Main." Vol. 1 to 8, Frankfurt a. M. 
1884-1898. This collection forms a part of the 


Erlangen edition of Luther's complete works. 





According to the original plan of this edition, to 
bring only Luther's writings, one would have had to 
limit oneself to Luther's letters written in Latin, 
without any further addition, but one has preferred 
instead, as already Burkhardt and Kolde did, an 
"exchange of letters". Now it cannot be denied that 
in many cases Luther's letters can only be 
understood through the letters addressed to him; 
therefore, we have also followed this example to 
some extent by including many foreign letters. The 
work of D. Enders is thorough, industrious, and 
worthy of thanks, and we have used it as a basis 
for the preparation of the greater part of our first 
section. Enders did not reprint the German letters 
in the Erlangen edition, but only referred to them 
and made the necessary improvements. 

The which Walch has 
assigned to the twenty-first part of Luther's 


letters of Luther, 


complete writings, are divided by him into three 
classes. The first includes those that have already 
been published in 


Foreword. 


The second contains the letters which, originally 
written in Latin, were not yet part of any collection 
of Luther's writings, but were first published by 
Walch in German translation; the third contains 
Luther's letters which had never been printed 
before. Each of these sections is arranged 
chronologically. The many letters that have 
already been included in earlier volumes, namely 
in the catechetical writings, vol. X, and in the 
reformation writings, vol. XV to XX, Walch has not 
reprinted in this volume, but only referred to them. 
Foreign letters, which are found in large numbers 
in other volumes, have not been included by 
Walch in this volume, nor has a record of them 
been given. 

Understandably, we could not follow Walch's 

arrangement, but, as all recent editions have 
done, we have included the letters in chronological 
order, including those that are not by Luther. In the 
selection of the latter, we have limited ourselves 
to the more important ones, the most important 
ones have been given unabridged, of others only 
a registry, unimportant and uninteresting ones 
have been omitted. We have referred to those 
already printed in other volumes. 
First of all, we thought to give the dear reader only 
the largest part of the first section of these letters, 
as far as they are contained in the Erlangen 
correspondence, from 





VII 


The reason for this is that, as already stated in the 
preface to the 17th volume of our edition, p. VII>, 
we are completely dependent on the editions 
published in Germany for the reproduction of the 
letters, since we do not have the sources at our 
disposal the 
correspondence, which has been in publication 


here, and also Erlangen 
since 1884, has only now reached the year 1531 
in its eighth volume. But the consideration that 
about as much time, namely again eighteen years, 
would pass until the completion of this German 
edition, and for us about two more years would be 
necessary to edit and publish this material, has led 
us to the decision to tackle the rest immediately, 
and, as well as we are able, to add it to our edition 
already now, whereby it achieves its completion. 
We have been encouraged in this by the fact that 
the edition of Luther's letters by De Wette is, to this 
day, the best and most complete and a treasure 
worth owning. Secondly, that many corrections, 
explanations and additions have been added by 
Seidemann _in the sixth volume of De Wette's 
edition. From the Corpus Reformatorum we have 
many additions. 

The first part of the book is a collection of letters. 
Burkhardt's "Dr. Martin Luther's Correspondence 
with Many Unknown Letters" has given us 
(besides his many corrections, more precise 
references 


VIII 


Foreword. 





and explanations of De Wette) yielded a rich 
Kolde 
Briefe und Actenstticke zur Geschichte Luthers. At 


harvest. Similarly, "Analecta Lutherana. 





the same time a supplement to the previous 
collections of his correspondence". We were able 
to take a number of letters from Seidemann's 
"Lutherbriefe" and Krafft's "Briefe und Documente 
Zeit der 
Documents from the Time of the Reformation) 2c. 
We hope that the thus enriched De Wette'sche 
edition (which we take as a basis) will be welcome 


aus der Reformation" (Letters and 


to the purchasers of our edition. 

However, we have not only been concerned 
with enriching Walch's and De Wette's editions, but 
primarily with correcting both the chronology and 
the text itself, and we believe that we have 
succeeded in the former in a few cases, but in the 
latter in many, even in texts supplied by Burkhardt 


and Kolde. 


In this volume, too, we have translated the 
originally Latin letters (with very few exceptions) 
into German. To show how highly necessary this 
was, we leave here some samples of Walch's 
translation, to which we could add many more. 
Walch, Vol. XXI, 521: parce verbis == give me 
credit for my words. Walch: “und schweiget". - Col. 
644: carnem mean quoque valere cupio == | also 
wish my relatives good welfare. Walch: "I also want 
my flesh to be healthy." - Col. 


646: De autoritate Ecclesiast. super purgatorio nihil 
scio -- | know nothing about a saying of the 
preacher Solomon about purgatory. Walch: "What 
the church is able to say about purgatory, | do not 
know."-Col. 658: Jejunus est, sensum scripturae 
magis quam verba retinens == He [the Sermon] is 
sober, and keeps more the sense than the words 
lof Scripture. Walch: "He is a dry miserable man 
who" 2c. - Col. 672: Ecce Tessaradeca tuam, imo 
nostram, mi Spalatine. Responsionem meam 
adversus Stolpensem, toloensem et talpensem 
schedulam non mireris animosiorem etc. - See, 
there you have your, 1) yes, our Tessaradecas, my 
dear Spalatin. Don't be surprised that my answer to 
tthe Stolpian, doltish and foolish note is somewhat 
vehement and proud. Walch: "Behold your, yes, my 
Four Tenths, dear Spalatin, namely the answer to 
the Stolpish, Doltish and Talpish d. i. blind mole 
note: do not be surprised" rc. Walch has thus 
identified Luther's delicious consolation for the 
Elector in fourteen 
consolatoria) (St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1816) with 
"Luther's answer to the note, which went out under 


chapters (Tessaradecas 


the official's seal at Stolpen" (St. Louis edition, vol. 
XIX, 462). - Col. 674: ut observatori meo naso vix 
illudant == that they can hardly fool my observing 
nose. Walch: "that they can hardly fool my 

1) This is what Luther calls this writing because 


Spalatin was supposed to translate it into German for the 
Elector.

thin noses may mock."-Col. 719: ut locum tuum 
non dimittas - that you do not leave your place. 
Walch: "that he [Satan] find no quiet place with 
you". - Col. 743: ut etsi non audeant asserere, non 
tamen possint dissuaderi == that although they 
dare not assert [my stay at Wartburg], yet they 
cannot be dissuaded. Walch: "that, though | may 
not affirm it, yet | may not dissemble or deny (sic) 
it: so" 2c. - Col. 745: a papistis ferior == | have 
peace before the papists. Walch: "and am beaten 
by the papists". - Col. 780: Nam et Principis ut 
christiani fratris, etiam Principis nomine, interest 
== For it is also to the prince as a Christian 
brother, also because he is a prince. Walch: "For 
it is also the prince and the brother Christian, 
because of the prince's interest." - Col. 921: 
Miserere mei_ jam praedestinatus fieri - [the 51st 
Psalm] "GOtt, sei mir gnadig" is already ordered to 
be made [into a German chant]. Walch: "Have 
mercy on me, that | am thus erwahlet before." But 
this may be enough. 

We have devoted the same effort and care to 
the German letters as to the Latin ones. Some of 
these offer no less a challenge to the editor. 


St. Louis, circa Pentecost 1903. 


The first part of the book is a book that presents more 
difficulties than the most difficult Latin ones, which we 


have set ourselves the task of overcoming. 


Where we have departed from De Wette and the 
Erlangen correspondence in the determination of time, 


we have given a detailed account of it. 


We have often taken notes and explanations from the 
Erlanger Briefwechsel, without giving credit to it each 
time. However, we have been very limited in the use of 
the notes compared to the Erlanger Briefwechsel, 
because there the notes sometimes take up more space 


than the text. 


It should also be noted that from then on, following De 
Wette, we no longer use the designation of the Erlangen 
correspondence for Aurifaber's unprinted collection at the 
library in Wolfenbittel: "Wolfenbittel, Cod. Helmst. 108", 
but like De Wette: "Aurifaber, Bd. Ill"; likewise, although 
we know that the Anhalt archive has been moved from 
Dessau to Zerbst, with De Wetternd Burkhardt, when 
indicating where the originals are, the designation: "The 


original is in Dessau." 


Now, may the merciful God give His blessing and 
prosperity also to the course of this volume. Praise, glory 
and thanks be to Him that He has helped us to this point.

First section of 


Luther's letters 


together with the most important letters addressed to Luther. 


No. 1. 


Erfurt. April 22, 1507. 


To Johann Braun, Vicarius in Eisenach. 


Luther invites Braun to come to his first mass (Primiz) and 
wishes that the Schalbe Collegium also participates. 


Printed in Aurifaber, vol. |, p. 1; in L6scher's Reformation Acts, 
vol. |, p. 1; in De Wette, vol. |, p. 3 and in Erlanger Briefwechsel, 
vol. I, p. 1. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 512. 


To the holy and venerable priest of Christ and Mary, 
Johann Braun, vicar at Eisenach, his most dear in 
Christ. 1) 

Hail in Christ our Lord! | would shy away, dear friend, 
from assailing your love with my impetuous letters and 
petitions, if | did not consider the sincere attitude of your 
kind and benevolent heart, which | have experienced 
enough from so many proofs and good deeds. 
Therefore, | have had no hesitation in addressing this 
little letter to you, trusting in the friendship that is based 
on mutual love, [and hope] that it will be heard by you 
and will find you supplicating. 

Now that the glorious God, who is holy in all his works, 
has rested to make me miserable, | will not be able to do 
it. 


1) In the next line, the Erl. Briefw. as superscription: Jhesu, 
and notes: "missing from De Wette". 
But it is also not found in any of the editions mentioned here and 
by him. 





to exalt so gloriously the and in every respect unworthy 
sinner and to call him to his exalted office out of pure and 
abundant mercy, | must, in order that | may be grateful 
for this abundance of so great a divine goodness (at least 
as much as is possible to a dust), perform the service 
imposed upon me in a bad way. 

Therefore, according to the decision of my fathers, it 
has been determined to perform this for the first time on 
the fourth Sunday [after Easter], which we call Cantate 
2), with the help of divine grace. For this day, because it 
is convenient for my father, has been appointed to 
consecrate our first Mass to God, to which | humbly, but 
perhaps boldly, invite your love, certainly not because | 
consider myself worthy because of my merits for you (of 
which there are none), to burden you with the burden of 
such a great journey, and to expect you to come to the 
so little poverty of our lowliness, but because | have 
recognized your goodwill towards me and your 
willingness when | was recently 3) with you, moreover, 
elsewhere even more abundantly. 


2) This was only the Primiz, not the priestly ordination of 
Luther. Luther was ordained by the Erfurt auxiliary bishop Johann 
(Bonemilch) von Laspho, but we do not know the day of his 
ordination. Késtlin, Martin Luther (3.), Vol. |, p. 83, places it on 
this very Sunday Cantate (May 2), but it was not the custom that 
the newly ordained held his first mass on the same day. (Erl. 
Briefw.) 

3) nudius. Walch correctly remarks: "perhaps tertius is to be 
added", and offers in the text: "the day before yesterday". 


Letters from 1507 and 1509. No. 1. 2. 


3 





You now, dearest father, lord, brother (for the first 
name is due to you because of your age and your care, 
the second because of your merit, but the last because of 
the order), want to be present here, if it is possible 
because of your time, because of your church business, 
or also your domestic affairs, in order to help by your 
pleasant presence and your prayers that our sacrifice 
becomes pleasing before God. You can, however, take 
Conrad, 1) my relative, who was formerly sexton 
(aedituum) at St. Nicolai, and besides him, whomever 
else you wish, as a traveling companion, if he can also 
get away for domestic business and feels like it. 

Finally, you must be admonished that you go straight 
to our monastery and enter it in order to stay with us for a 
while (since | do not fear that you will not want to live’ 
here), and do not seek another, strange lodging on the 
streets. For you will have to become a cellarius, that is, 
a cell dweller. Fare well in Christ our Lord. Given from our 
monastery at Erfurt, April 22, in the year of the Lord 1507. 
Brother Martin Luther 

from Mansfeld. 


| do not dare to burden the Schalbe Collegium, 3) 
those worthy people who have certainly rendered me 
great service, in an inconvenient manner, because | am 
completely convinced that it is not befitting for their status| 
and dignity that they should be called upon to perform 
such a lowly service, indeed, that they should be bothered 
with the wishes 4) of a monk who has now died to the 
world. Besides, | am uncertain 


1) In 1500 Conrad Luther was still in service as sexton 
(hierophylax). The kind of relationship is not known. (Késtlin, M. 
Luther [3.] Vol. |, p. 777 ad p. 39.) ' 

2) Here we have added a non. 

3) The Collatoren - Collegium of the Minorite monastery under| 

the Wartburg, to which the Schalbe family, respected in Eisenach, 
had made rich donations. (Erl. Briefw.) Mrs. Cotta came from this 
family. (Késtlin, M. Luther [3., Vol. 1, p. 38.) 
4) It can hardly be doubted that vota should be translated here by 
"wishes" and not (with Walch) by "vows", because neither the 
primicat nor the invitation to the same has anything to do with the} 
monastic vows. 





and somewhat doubtful whether it would be pleasant or 
troublesome to you. Therefore, | have resolved to remain 
silent, but | would like you, if the opportunity arises, to 
testify my gratitude toward them. Farewell. 


No. 2. 


Wittenberg. March 17, 1509. 


To Joh. Braun, priest in Eisenach. 


Luther had gone to Wittenberg as a professor in the last 
weeks of 1508 and apologizes for having left Erfurt without first 
taking leave of Braun. He says that he would have preferred 
theology to philosophy. 


Printed in Aurifaber, vol. |, p. 2b; in Léscher's Ref.Acta, vol. |, 
p. 797; in De Wette, vol. I, p. 5 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. |, p.4. 
German in Walch, vol. XXI, 524. 


To the venerable man sanctified to Christ and Mary, 
Mr. Johann Braun, priest at Eisenach, his beloved 
Lord and Father. 

JEsus. 

Salvation and the Savior Jesus Christ himself wishes 
brother Martin Luther, Augustinian. Finally, | beg you, my 
Lord and loving, more than revered, Father, cease, | say, 
to wonder, after you have already wondered enough, how 
| left you secretly and silently, or at least could have left 
you, as if there had never been any intimate contact 
between us, or as if oblivion, the author of ingratitude, had 
wiped out all memory of your lovely person from my heart, 
yes, as if a cold and hopeful north wind had extinguished 
all warmth of love. It is not so, nor have | done this, nor 
thought to do this, although | would have done this (if | 
had done it differently and not rather suffered hut), from 
which one could think something bad about me without 
my fault. 

| have indeed left, | confess, but | have not left, but 
have always remained behind after my bigger and better 
part and will always remain there. That this is so, | will not 
be able to obtain from you more easily or more effectively, 
than through

Letters from the years 1509 and 1512. No. 2. 3. 5 





Your trust in me; as you have established this with me 
through your merits and good deeds by your kindness 
alone, you will not suffer it to go unfulfilled or even 
diminished without my fault, as you have never suffered 
it. And so | have departed from you further in body, but 
have come closer in mind, if only you will, as you certainly 
will, if my hope does not deceive me. 

And, to come to the point: So that | would not be 

compelled to suspect any longer that your love doubts 
my fidelity (and yet God wanted this suspicion, as is its 
nature, to hit the wrong thing), behold, with all the power 
at my disposal | have stolen a little time from my so many 
and so varied affairs in which to write this letter to you, 
especially since messengers are rare for me, and if they 
were frequent, they would become rare through my 
ignorance and seclusion. And what do you think that | am 
seeking with this letter other than that you hold me in 
such command as you have received me, and that you 
presuppose of me what you would have me presuppose 
of you. Although | cannot or will not be equal to you in 
any good thing, my heartfelt love (animus) for you is 
great, since | have nothing else; of course, | do not give 
it to you now, but | say that | have already given it to you 
many times. And there is nothing that your generous 
spirit expects of me (that | know), but what is of the spirit, 
that is, that only one mind be in the Lord, and one heart 
and one soul, as one faith in the Lord. 
But you should not be surprised that | left without telling 
you. For my departure was so sudden that it was almost 
hidden from my housemates. | wanted to write to you, but 
| could not because of lack of time and leisure. However, 
| have suffered, because | was able to do so, since | was 
forced to leave so suddenly without having greeted you. 
Therefore, | am now at Wittenberg by God's command or 
permission. If you now wish to know about my fate, | am 
well, thanks be to God, only that the study has been 
forced upon me (violentum). 





| would have preferred to exchange it from the beginning 
with theology, with that theology, | say, which investigates 
the kernel of the nut and the marrow of the wheat and the 
marrow of the bones. But God is God; man is often, yes, 
always mistaken in his judgment. This is our God; He will 
rule us in kindness and for all eternity. 


Receive this graciously, | beg you, what | have thrown 
down in haste and entirely without longer consideration, 
and if you can once conveniently have messengers to 
me, let me share your letters. | will endeavor to do the 
same. Fare well in the beginning and in the end, and think 
of me as the kind of person you wanted me to be. 
Farewell again. At Wittenberg, in the year of the Lord 
1509, on the Saturday after Oculi [March 17]. 


Brother Martin Luther, Augustinian.

Wittenberg. September 22, 1512. 
To the Prior Andreas Lohr and the Convent of the 


Augustinians at Erfurt. 


Luther announces the date of his doctorate in theology and 
asks his brothers in Erfurt to be present or at least to intercede for 
him.

The day of St. Luke 1) is approaching, on which, out of 
obedience 2) to the fathers and the venerable father 
Vicarius, the chair 3) in theology will be solemnly given to 
me, which your fatherly love, as | believe, clearly sees 
from the letter of our prior at Wittenberg 4). | leave my 
self-accusation 5) pending and say nothing of my 
inadequacy, lest | also seem to seek pride or praise 
through my humility. God knows it, and my conscience, 
how worthy and how grateful | am against this splendor 
of glory and honor. 

Therefore, for the sake of Christ's mercy, | ask, first of 
all, that you will command me in your common 
intercessions to God, as you know that you are my 
debtors in this matter according to the law of love, that his 
pleasing and blessed will be with me; then, if it is at all 
possible, that you will deign to be present and take part 
in this pomp (to confess the truth) for the adornment and 
honor of the Order and especially of our Vicariate. | would 
not dare to ask your paternal love for the arduousness of 
such a great journey and expense, but do it only because 
the reverend Father Vicarius has so ordered, and 
because | considered it unseemly, also indecent and 
annoying, if |, while you Erfurtians did not know about it 
and had not been invited, ascended to such a high 
dignity. 

Now if the venerable Father Lector, Georg Leister, 
wants to or can come with you, that would also be very 
pleasant; but if not, 6)

Leipzig. October 9, 1512. 


Luther's receipt. 


Luther had to collect from Leipzig the money that the Elector 
had put up to cover the expenses of his doctorate. This is his 
receipt for it to the churflrstliche Rentmeister. See Mathesius, St. 
Louis Edition, p. 10. 


The original is in Cod. Seidelianus in Dresden, p. 26, with the 
inscription by the same hand: "vicario Zu Wittb. Stawbicz | ffl. Zu 
eim Doctorat Michaelis 1512." Printed by Schutze, "Luthers 
ungedruckte Briefe," Leipzig 1780, vol. |, p. 385, from the

the original. The first letter in the 6th volume of De Wette, 
supposedly from 1503, is, as Seidemann himself says, who adds 
it, spurious.

(even by Seidemann) the date "October 4" was set, the day of 
Franciscus. On this day Luther became Licentiate. (So Kolde, M. 
Luther, vol. |, p. 82, and Késtlin, M. Luther [3.], vol. |, p. 99.) The 
correct date, also in Burkhardt, p. 1. - This word: "after" is 
followed in the original: "Micha", but Luther crossed it out again. 
Nevertheless, it has passed into the editions of Schtitze and De

German in Walch, vol. XXI, 518, who, according to Tentzel's 
Historischer Bericht von der Reformation, vol. |, p. 165, also 
places this letter in the year 1510. 


JEsus. 


Peace be with you, venerable Lord Magister Georg! 
My brother Johann Lang has asked me in your name. 3) 
What | think of the cause of the innocent and highly 
learned Johann Reuchlin against his enemies in 
Cologne, whether he is in danger of the faith or of heresy. 
But you know, my dear Magister, that | also hold this man 
in very high esteem and love him, and that my judgment 
is perhaps suspect, because | am (as they say) not free 
and impartial; but, because you demand it, | say what is 
my opinion: that in his whole written opinion there is 
absolutely nothing that would be dangerous to me. 

| am, however, very surprised about the people of 
Cologne, for whom they have to tie such an intricate, and 
(as it seems to them) in fact even more intricate knot than 
the Gordian one ina 


1) There has been much dispute about the date of this letter. 
Léscher, De Wette, Seckendorf and Tentzel, even Seidemann in 
De Wette, vol. VI, p. 598, place it in the year 1510, while the other 
authorities place it in the year 1514. We are Késtlin, Martin Luther 
(3.), vol. |, p. 784 p. 139; Kolde, Martin Luther, Vol. |, p. 373 ad 
p. 126 and Erlanger Briefwechsel, which are based on Knaake 
in Zeitschrift fur lutherische Theologie und Kirche, Jahrgang 
1868, p. 345 in the review on Burkhardt's "Luthers Briefwechsel". 

2) actually Georg Burkhardt from Spalt an der Rezat, 4-1/2 
miles from Nuremberg. Kolde, M. Luther, Vol. |, p. 41 writes: 
"Spelt". See No. 136. 

3) Spalatin's letter to Johann Lang in Wittenberg (end of 1513), 
to which this reply refers, is found in Erlanger Briefwechsel, vol. 
I, p. 11. 





4) since he very often uses such a solemn protestation, 
and does not present articles of faith, but the opinion of 
an expert opinion. These two things relieve him of so 
much suspicion with me in such a way that, even if he 
had gathered the mud of all heresies in his expert 
opinion, | would still believe that he had right and pure 
faith. For if such protestations and opinions are not free 
from danger, we will have to fear that these inquisitors 
might finally start swallowing cameos and swallowing 
mosquitoes, and declare the orthodox, even if they 
protest in everything, to be heretics. 

But what shall | say about the fact that they are trying 
to cast out Beelzebub and not with the finger of God? 
This is what | often lament and regret, because we 
Christians have begun to be wise abroad and 
nonsensical at home. 6) A hundredfold worse are the 
blasphemies in all the streets of Jerusalem, and 
everything is full of spiritual idols. Although these should 
be dealt with most diligently, as inward enemies, yet we 
leave all these things that concern us most, and turn to 
outward and strange things, of course by the devil's 
counsel, so that we leave what is ours and do not mend 
what is strange. 

Dear, can anything more _ foolish and 
incomprehensible be thought of than this zeal? Do the 
unfortunate people of Cologne have so few difficult and 
very confused things on which they would like to practice 
their science, their zeal and their love, that it would be 
necessary for them, since their mind is so far away from 
us, to first explore them? 

But what do | do? My heart is full of these thoughts, 
more than the tongue can say. But | finally make this 
conclusion, since this is predicted by all prophets: that 
the Jews 


4) Compare Plautus, Men. 2, 1, 22; Terentius, Andr. 5, 4, 39. 
(Erl. Briefw.) 

5) We think that suspiciono or suppositione should be read 
instead of superstitione; "superstition" does not seem to make 
sense to us. 

6) About the saying: Foris sapere et domi desipere, see 
Luther's explanation, Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. V, 830, § 76. 


10 


God and their King Christinn will revile and blaspheme. 
And | confess that he who has read this or does not 
understand it, has not yet seen the theology. And 
therefore | suppose that the Colognians cannot dissolve 
the Scripture, because it must be done and the Scripture 
must be fulfilled. And if they should undertake to cleanse 
the Jews from blasphemies, they will do so, that the 
Scripture and God appear to be lies. 

But have a certain confidence that God will be true, 
even if a thousand times a thousand Cologne people do 
not want it and struggle against it in vain. For this will be 
the work of God alone, who works from within, not of 
men, who only play rather than work from without. If these 
things are taken from them, they will compose worse. For 
they are so given over to a hardened mind by God's wrath 
that they are, as Ecclesiastes [Cap. 1, 15.]?) says, 
incorrigible, and every incorrigible becomes worse and 
never bettered by chastening. Fare well in the Lord and 
keep my words to me, 3) but pray for my sinful soul to the 
Lord. Given from our monastery this day.

To Prior Andreas Lohr and the seniors of the Erfurt 


Augustinian Convent. 


Luther defended himself against the accusation of some 
Erfurtians, especially M. Joh. Nathin, that he had been guilty of a 
breach of oath by accepting the theological doctorate in 
Wittenberg instead of in Erfurt, where he had received his 
doctorate in theology. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. A 399, fol. 118. Printed in Aurifaber, 
vol. I, p. 6b; in Loscher's Ref.-Acta, vol. |, p. 803; in De Wette, vol. 
I, p. 11 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. |, p.17. German in Walch, vol. XXI,

1) Namely, the blasphemies of the Jews. Walch has the 
remark: "istae is not to be set off, on which it goes"; it refers to 
blasphemiae in the previous paragraph. 

2) See Luther's interpretation of this passage, St. Louis edition, 
vol. V, 1399.

To the venerable and devout fathers and brothers, the 
prior Andreas Lohr and the elders of the 
monastery of the order of the hermits of St. 
Augustine at Erfurt, his brothers who are highly 
honored in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail in the Lord, venerable fathers! Although | have 
heard and read many evil things that have been said 
about us, 4) especially about me, by some of you, | have 
recently been so moved by the letters of Father John 
Nathin, who writes, as it were, in the name of all of you, 
by the lies, pointed words, and bitter and mocking 
challenges of him, that | was close to pouring out the full 
bowl of wrath and indignation on him and the entire 
Convention after the example of Magister Paltz 5). 

Therefore | have also addressed two stupid letters 
to you, - | do not know whether they have reached you, - 
and would have sent their secret interpretation 
immediately, if the mouth of him who speaks ungodly 
things had not been shut on the occasion of the 
convened meeting. Therefore | am forced to consider 
many of you, even most of you, already excused. 

Therefore | ask you, if you or some among you are 
offended in these letters in something 


4) Instead of vobis in the editions, we have used the Codex 
and the Erl. Briefw. nobis assumed. 

5) Joh. Nathin had begun his theological course in Tubingen 
in 1484 and should also have received his doctorate there, but 
did so in Erfurt, which sheds a peculiar light on his behavior in 
Luther's promotion matter. He was in Erfurt since 1488 and is 
listed as professor of theology in 1493. He was next to Paltz in 
the monastery when Luther entered in 1505. During a visitation, 
he praised Luther to the nuns at Muhlhausen as a model of 
holiness, another Paul (Kolde, M. Luther, Vol. I, p. 57). -Johann 
Paltz, actually Johann Zenser von Paltz in Swabia or in the 
archdiocese of Trier, Augustinian, famous preacher of 
indulgences under Raymund von Gurk, author of the "heavenly 
treasure trove" (St. Louis edition, vol. XV, 201), was professor of 
theology in Erfurt when Luther entered the monastery, since 1504 
also provost in the monastery zum Neuen Werk near Halle. In 
1507 he moved to Mihlheim (now Thal Ehrenbreitstein near 
Coblenz), probably because of the quarrel with the Erfurt 
convent, which Luther denounced here. He died on March 13, 
1511 (Erl. Briefw.). 

6) Walch offers: "a doubly fatuous letter". 


12 


Forgive me this, and lay what | have done only to the 
angry writings of Magister Nathin. For my exceedingly 
great agitation was a just one. 

But now | hear even more annoying things, that this 
same person is everywhere calling me a perjurer and a 
shameful person; | do not know in which power he trusts. 
But | ask you, since you (as | fear) cannot stop his mouth, 
that you at least moderate yourselves and teach others 
to refrain from his words. For | am not perjured for the 
sake of it, because | received my doctorate elsewhere. 
For both universities, and all of you, know that | did not 
acquire the first degree, for the Bible,') where it is 
customary to swear, at Erfurt, nor am | aware that | have 
taken any oath in my entire [academic] career. And the 
beginning 2) with the sentences 3) | have indeed made 
at Erfurt, but that | have sworn, | believe, no one will 
claim. But what Magister Nathin will hear from me by the 
power of the one who commands and demands 
obedience 4) he will perhaps see in his own time. 

| am writing this, dearest fathers, so that the 
theologians of Erfurt do not take me for a despiser of their 
university, to which | ascribe everything that is mine as a 
thankful mother. | have not despised them [the 
theologians], nor will | ever despise them, although my 
incorporation [into the convent of the Augustinians at 
Wittenberg] and my doctorate have made me a stranger 
to them according to the place. But both these things the 
convent, if it had wanted, could have prevented with one 
word; but what it could and did not want then, behold, it 
cannot do now, even if it wanted to. 


1) in Bibliam, that is, Baccalaureus biblicus. Luther received 
this degree, with which he was permitted to lecture on the Bible, 
at Wittenberg on March 9, 1509. 

2) Aurifaber: in principio. According to this wrong reading, 
Walch's translation is meaningless. 

3) as a Sententiarius, who received permission to read over 
the first two books of the Sentences of Peter Lombardus. 

4) namely of the vicar Staupitz, who had forced Luthern to the 
doctorate.

13 


For in such a way it pleased GOtte to nullify the 
ambiguities and the threats of those who hoped for 
revenge. 

But all this may pass away, for | am quite calm and 
peaceable in my heart towards all of you, however much 
| have been offended. For God blesses me, the unworthy, 
in avery special way, so that | have only cause to rejoice, 
and to love and do good, likewise to those who have 
earned the opposite for me, just as | also have earned 
the opposite of what | receive from God from the Lord. 
Therefore, | ask that you also be content, and put away 
the bitterness that may be present, and may my release 
from your bond (excorporatio) not move you, because 
the Lord has willed it so, which must not be resisted. Be 
well in the Lord. From our monastery in Wittenberg, June 
sixteenth, 1514.

Wittenberg. August 5, 1514. 


To Georg Spalatin. 


Luther testifies to his displeasure at the outrageous attacks of 
Ortwin (Ortuinus Gratius [de Graes]) against Reuchlin. He was 
one of Hoogstraten's comrades and wrote Apologiam adversus 
Joh. Reuchlinum; this 
appeared in February 1514. 


The damaged original is in the Minist erialbibliothek 5) at 
Erfurt. Handwritten in Cod. Jen. a, fol. 278. Printed by Aurifaber, 
vol. |, p. 5; by Léscher, Ref.-Acta. Vol. |, p. 802; in De Wette, Vol. 
|, p. 13 and in Erlanger Briefwechsel, Vol. |, p. 20. German in 
Walch, Vol. XXI, 522. 

To the highly learned and by him in Christ highly 
admired priest, Georg Spalatin, his allertheuersten 
[friend]. 

JEsus. 

Hail! Until now, highly learned Spalatin, | have taken 
this Cologne poetaster Ortwin for an ass. But you see 
that he has become a dog, yes, a ravening wolf in 
sheep's clothing, if not rather a crocodile, as you think 
even more astutely. |, at least, believe that he himself, 
since our Johann Reuchlin has indicated to him that he 
is a donkey, has become a dog. 


5) So De Wette. The Erl. Briefw. says: at the university library.

(asinitatem, to speak Greek in the Latin language 1) 
finally even grasped it with his hands, but, since he was 
anxious to take it off and to put on the lion majesty, he 
remained in a wolf or crocodile by an unfortunate leap on 
this side, namely since he strove too much beyond his 
strength to effect the transformation. 

Dear God, what shall | say? Let us learn here, | beg 
you, from this one, the judgment of all who have ever 
written or spoken, write or speak, write or speak about 
spitefulness: how quite true, reasonable and sensible it 
is; | say especially of spitefulness, which is probably the 
most nonsensical, which wants to harm most violently 
and yet is unable to do so. Although its licentiousness is 
without fear, yet 2) its incapacity is exceedingly full of 
extraordinary anguish and unrest. 

It is true that this Ortwin foolishly brings together and 
forces ridiculous and self-contradictory things, but more 
correctly, things to be deplored and lamented, not only 
because he twists the words and the meaning of the quite 
innocent Capnio [Reuchlin] with all sacrilegiousness, but 
also because he increases the damage of blindness and 
obstinacy in his heart with all fury, as the Scripture says 
[Habak. 2, 6]: "He only loads much mud 3) upon himself." 

| would discuss many things from those writings with 
you by letter, if one did not have to suffer more than laugh 
about them, with such great destruction of souls, which | 
fear even more for the future. May the Lord grant that it 
will soon come to an end. But it is a special joy to me that 
the matter has reached Rome and the apostolic see 
rather than that in other places 4) those hostile people are 
free to judge 5) . . . Since Rome has very learned people 
among the Cardinals, [so]. 


1) Luther says this jokingly because of the non-Latin word 
asinitas (donkey nature) which he formed. 

2) We have adopted tamen instead of turn with Aurifaber. 

3) Walch reads: /umen [light], instead of: /utum [koth]. 

4) in partibus == in other places besides Rome. 

5) Here is in the original, already torn in Aurifaber's time, a 
smaller and immediately following a larger gap, which we have 
tried to fill in something. 





at least more mercy [for Reuchlin can be expected from 
them than] will be granted by the unwilling Cologne 
people, [more] than these ABC grammarians have, who 
can neither distinguish what a writer tells, nor what he 
claims, yes, also cannot understand what he speaks, but 
more correctly | say, do not want to understand. Farewell 
and pray for me, and let us pray for our Capnio. From the 
monastery, on the day of the Blessed Virgin of the Snows

No. 8. 
Wittenberg. December 21, 1514. 


To the Dean and Doctors of the Theological Faculty 


at Erfurt. 
About the same subject as No. 6. 


The original of this letter was formerly in the Carthauserkloster 
at Trier, now in the city library there. From the original published 
by Prof. Joh. Hugo Wyttenbach in the program of the Gymnasium 
zu Trier of 1829, p. 6. Afterwards in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, 
p. 9 and in Erl. Briefwechsel, vol. |, p. 23. 

To the excellent and exceedingly righteous men, 
fathers and lords, the dean and the other doctors of 
the theological faculty of the University of Erfurt, his 
patrons, with all devotion to service and much 
reverence in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Reverence and service from our lowliness. | have 
heard a not good rumor about me, dear men, fathers and 
highly esteemed gentlemen, namely that | am accused of 
breach of oath by your dignities, because | have accepted 
the degree of a doctor elsewhere than at Erfurt; since | 
now realize that this is something that not only annoys 
your dignities, but also the least human being, | see that 
it is incumbent upon me to be humble enough and to seek 
to be reconciled again. But | ask urgently, 


6) De Wette reads here: Augustinus, the name, which Luther 
received at his entrance into the monastery, but it is to be read 
with Aurifaber, Léscher and the Erlangen correspondence 
Augustinianus, because in the original on the last letters an 
abbreviation is to be recognized (Késtlin, M. Luther, vol. |, p.778 
ad p. 63).

that you hear me with your ears, that is, with kindness 
and perfect patience, for you will more easily forgive, as | 
hope, when you will have recognized that | have been 
without deceit or at least ignorant in this matter. Above 
all, it is certain that | did not become a baccalaureate 
(biblicus) at Erfurt, but at Wittenberg; therefore, | did not 
swear to obtain the baccalaureate (pro biblia), which, as 
| hear, is custom and order among you. But since | had 
already 1) disputed here to attain the degree of a 
Sententiarius, and, because | had been called to Erfurt, 
had postponed the completion (principium), | was 
admitted and accepted by your, rather our faculty with all 
difficulty, since, when the Dean, the excellent Mr. 
Storheim, began to present me with the regulations 
(statuta) 2) the Doctor was interrupted by the 
venerable father Magister Johann Nathin, who had 
variously noted on a large piece of paper what must 
actually be read and held for the Baccalaureates or for 
the Sententiaries, and prescribed to him that he should 
so read what served the present matter. For this | have 
quite certainly in my memory and am not aware of any 
oath. | confess that | doubt very much whether what 
concerns a Baccalaureus (in which, as | hear, this oath is 
contained) is also read for me, but much more whether | 
have also sworn. For that would have been a very 
pleasant shield for me, which | could have held up to the’ 
one who commanded me to 3) let myself be [promoted to 
doctor, since | not only did not seek this, but even resisted 
his violence to the point of annoyance. But since | was 
neither aware [of an oath] nor had a memory of it, and 
those to whom it was incumbent to speak looked through 
their fingers, | was forced to render obedience, but, what 
| did not know, with a 


1) namely at Wittenberg, where the disputation for the 
attainment of the dignity of a Sententiarius had already been held, 
when Luther was forced to go to Erfurt in a hurry. 

2) Here some words are missing, perhaps: "and to read the 
same". 

3) Staupitz. Cf. no. 3 at the beginning and no. 6 towards the 
end. 





Offense with you. What do | care that some have not 
believed me or do not believe me? The awareness of the 
truth is enough for me, and my witness is God Himself. 
But this | do not write, dear fathers, that | want to be 
considered excused by these things or complain about 
injustice. | know that it can be rightly said against me: but 
nevertheless, you have not heard, you have not sworn: 
what about the condition of the right? yes, how? since you 
have heard our ordinances for almost six years 
afterwards? You are a member and you have sworn to 
keep our given and yet to be made orders. | admit it and 
acknowledge it, my mother, the University of Erfurt, to 
whom | owe not strife but honor. Therefore, | do not seek 
a fierce defense of the law, but rather, bound in Christ, | 
present a simple confession, for the general oath also 
oppresses me sufficiently, whatever in particular seems 
to excuse the ignorance here. Therefore, | humbly ask 
and beg, for the sake of the kindness of God our Savior, 
that your dignities forgive me first of all this offense and 
forgive me the guilt, be it because of a real matter, or be 
it for superfluous assurance and inner calming of my 
conscience, as we are commanded to forgive our debtors, 
because this was done without deceit and knowledge, 
which may have happened. Then | also ask this, that you 
will condescend to indulge (dispensare) in all things, to

(defectus supplere), if not (which | may not assume in 
view of your kindness) any of these things should seem 
to have to be cut off for my punishment. Since |, as a poor 
man of Christ, cannot do enough in any other way, | will 
gladly suffer with shame that | am regarded by you as a 
clumsy and rejected man; | seek more that the guilt than 
the punishment be remitted to me, if neither can be 
conceded. This | would have done long ago, and 
presently, in words; for this | had resolved to do, but, |

printing are not yet ready and must be printed in his presence.

To the highly learned man Georg Spalatin, priest of 
Christ, his [friend] highly honored in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail! Only returned yesterday, 3) | found your letter 
late in the day, my dear Spalatin; | ask you that you 
answer for me that Martin Mercator 4) that he may not 
expect my dictations on the Psalter 5). 


1) distuli rem is Plitt's conjecture instead of: distulerim. 
2) Seidemann has placed the year 1515 above this letter. 

3) from Erfurt. Lingke, Luthers Reisegeschichte (1769), p. 26. 

4) Aurifaber, De Wette and Seidemann (De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 
482) take Mercator as a proper name; on the other hand, the 
Erlangen correspondence wants mercator to be interpreted as 
an apellative, and the first name "Martin" to Martinus 
Herbipolensis (== Landesberg from WiUrzburg) in Leipzig, 
because neither a Mercator nor a "merchant" is found in the 
printer directories. We are not able to decide about this.

Although | wish extraordinarily that they are not 
published anywhere and never, | have nevertheless 
been forced to do so. | have not yet done enough to fulfill 
the commandment, but now that | have finished the 
public lecture on Paul 6), | want to devote myself to this 
one work constantly. 

But even if they [the Dictates] were finished, they are 
not put together in such a way that they could be printed 
in my absence. Then it has pleased the masters of the 
liberal arts (Artistis) that they should be printed by the 
work of our printer 7). But this cannot even be started 
before Lent, 8) This very thing (if they have to be 
published at all) has also pleased me, so that they are 
first printed with rather bad 9) types, because they do not 
seem to me to be of such a kind that they should be 
produced with good type and by the service of skilled 
men, because they are insignificant things (Nugae) and 
quite worthy of eradication. Farewell. In haste from the

To the devout and sincere brother Georg Spenlein, 1) 
Augustinian hermit, who is staying in the 
monastery at Memmingen, his [friend] to be loved 
in the Lord. 


JEsus Christ. 
Grace and peace be with you from God the Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ! Dearest brother George, 


| am fighting against this error, but have not yet overcome 
it. 

Therefore, my dear brother, learn Christ, and that the 
crucified, learn to sing to him and to despair of yourself 
and to say to him: Thou, Lord JEsu, art my 
righteousness, but | am thy sin; thou hast taken upon 


| thee that which is mine, and hast given me that which is 


want you to know that | have collected three and a half thine; thou hast received that which thou wast not, and 


florins from your sold things, namely one florin for the 
Brussels vestment, half a florin for the larger work of the! 


Eisenacher 2) and one florin for the habit and several thyself, nay, 


other things. Now there are still some left, as Baptista's 
eclogues and your collections, in which you will have to 
suffer loss. For until now we have not been able to sell 
these things. We have now transferred the third and a 
half florins for you to the venerable father Vicarius. As for 
the last half florin which you owe him, you will endeavor} 
either to pay or to obtain remission of the debt. For | am 
of the opinion that the reverend father, being well 
disposed towards you, will have no difficulty in remitting 
to you what is left. 

By the way, | would like to Know what your soul is 
doing: whether it does not finally, tired of its own 
righteousness, learn to breathe again in the 
righteousness of Christ and to trust in it. For in our time, 
the temptation of presumption is widespread among 
many, and especially among those who strive with all 
their might to be just and good; not knowing the 


hast given me that which | was not. Beware lest thou 
strive even for so great a purity as not to appear to 
not to be, a sinner. For Christ dwells only in 
sinners. For this is why he descended from heaven, 
where he dwelt in the righteous, that he might dwell in 
sinners also. Consider this love of his with thee 
continually, and thou shalt see his exceeding sweet 
consolation. For if we had to come to the rest of 
conscience through our efforts and tribulations, for what 
would he have died? Therefore, you will find peace only 
in him, through complete despair of yourself and your 
works. Moreover, you will learn from him that just as he 
himself accepted you, he also made your sins his own, 
and his righteousness yours. 

If you believe this firmly, as you are guilty (for cursed 
is he who does not believe this), you also receive your 
unruly and still erring brethren, and bear with them 
patiently, and make their sins yours, and if you have 
anything good, let it be yours, as the apostle [Rom. 15:7] 
teaches, "Receive one another, even as Christ hath 


righteousness of God, which is given to us in Christ most} &XcePted you unto the praise of God"; and again [Phil. 


abundantly and freely, they seek to do such lukewarm 
good works through themselves until they have the 
confidence that they can stand before God, adorned as 


2:5], "Be ye therefore minded, even as Jesus Christ was; 
who, though he was in the form of God, yet uttered 
himself. "2c. So also thou, if thou seemest to thyself to be 


it were with their virtues and merits, which cannot better, think it not robbery, as though thou alone were so; 


possibly happen. You have been with us in this opinion, 
rather error; | have been too, but even now

but divest thyself, forgetting of what nature thou art, and 
be as one of them, that thou bearest it. 

For unblessed is the righteousness of such a man 
who 3) treats others as if they were in disguise.

that we have translated. In our copy of the Aurifaber, this

This means that he buries the Lord's pound and does not 
give his fellow servants what is due to them. Therefore, if 
you are a lily and a rose of Christ, know that your walk 
will be among thorns; only see that you do not become a 
thorn through impatience and sacrilegious judgment or 
hidden hope. The dominion of Christ is in the midst of his 
enemies, as the Psalm [110:2] says. 

What then dost thou devise, that thou shouldest be in 
the midst of friends? Therefore, seek all that thou lackest 
on thy knees, asking of the Lord Jesus. He will teach you 
everything; only consider what he has done for you and 
for all, so that you too may learn what you should do for 
others. If he had wanted to die only for the good and for 
friends, dear, for whom would he have died or for whom 
would he have lived? Act in this way, my brother, and 
pray for me, and the Lord be with you. Fare well in the 
Lord. From Wittenberg, Tuesday after Misericordias 
Domini [April 8] 1516.

JEsus. 

Hail in the Lord and in his Comforter! Werther father 
and dear brother in the Lord, | hear that you, dear brother, 
are challenged by storms, plagued and troubled by many 
a flood. But praise be to God, the Father of mercy and the 
God of all comfort, who has provided you with the best 
comforter and advisor that one can have among men.

The Father Magister Bartholomew, 1) can take care of 
you. Let it only be your concern that you throw away your 
own feeling and mine from you, and give his words room 
in your heart. For | am sure, and instructed by your 
experience and mine, yea, also from the experience of all 
whom | have ever seen troubled, | know that the 
prudence of our sense alone is the cause and root of all 
our trouble. For our eye is a great mischief, and that | 
speak of myself, ei! in how great misery it has afflicted 
me, and afflicts me still in the utmost. 

The cross of Christ is distributed over the whole world, 
each one always receives his part of it. Therefore, do not 
throw it away from you, but rather receive it as a highly 
holy relic, not in a golden or silver vessel, but in a golden 
heart, i.e., one that is dressed with mild love. For if the 
wood of the cross is so consecrated by the touch of 
Christ's flesh and blood that the remains of it are most 
honestly held, how much more are the _ insults, 
persecutions, sufferings and hatred of men, whether they 
be just or unjust, the most holy relics, which are not 
grasped, kissed and blessed by the touch of his flesh, but 
of his exceedingly loving 2) heart and divine will through 
love, and are highly consecrated above all things, 
because the curse is changed into blessing, and injustice 
into equity, and suffering into glory, and the cross into joy. 
Farewell, dear father and brother, and pray for me. From 
Wittenberg, on the 15th day of April, 1516.

Mainz. 


JEsus. 

Hail in the Lord! Venerable and dear Father Prior, | 
have heard through a bad rumor that there is with you, 
Father (aoud Paternitatem tuam), a certain Georg 
Baumgirtner, my brother from our convent in Dresden, 
who has come to you, Father, unfortunately, for 
shameful reasons and in a shameful way. But | thank 
you for your faithfulness and your kind service, that you 
took him in, so that the disgrace would come to an end. 
That lost sheep is mine, it belongs to me; it is mine to 
seek and to bring back from astray, if it pleases the Lord 
JEsu so. 

| therefore ask you, Father, for the sake of our 
common faith in Christ and the religious vow to St. 
Augustine, to send him to me either to Dresden or to 
Wittenberg, if your servant love is in any way able to do 
so, or to persuade him to go, to cause him in a kind and 
gracious way to come voluntarily. | will receive him with 
open arms, he shall only come; he has therefore not to 
fear that he has given me offence. 

| know, | know, that aversions must come; and it is no 
miracle that a man falls, but it is a miracle when a man 
rises and remains standing. Peter fell so that he would 
know that he was a man; the cedars of Lebanon, which 
touch the sky with their towering summit, also fall today; 
but also (what surpasses everything amazing) an angel 
in heaven fell and Adam in paradise. What is it to be 
wondered at, therefore, if a reed is tossed to and fro by 
the whirlwind, and a smoldering wick is extinguished? 
May the Lord Jesus 





teach you, and do and accomplish the good work with 
you. Amen. Farewell. Alls Dresden, in our monastery, on 
the day of Saints Philip and James [May 1] 1516.

To Conrad Mutianus Rufus, Canonicnus in Gotha. 


Luther apologizes for not having visited or invited him during 
his stay in Gotha. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. A 399, fol. 121 d. Printed in 
Aurifaber, vol. |, p. 15; in Léscher, vol. |, p. 810; in De Wette, vol.

The highly learned and highly educated Conrad 


Mutianus, 2) Canonicus at Gotha, Doctor of Laws, 
that is, a very worthy man. 


JEsus. 


Hail in the Lord! The fact that | have not bribed your 
love, highly learned and highly educated Mutianus, nor 
invited you to me, is partly due to the haste of my journey 
and likewise also the diligence in carrying out the service 
assigned to me, but also due to the high opinion and true 
reverence which | have for you. For our mutual friendship 
3) is too young for me to have dared to question your 
excellence, which is true in my eyes and in itself. 


1) Ten convents were subordinated to Luther as vicarius: 
Wittenberg, Dresden, Herzberg, Gotha, Salza, Nordhausen, 
Sangershausen, Erfurt, Magdeburg and Neustadt. Eisleben was 
added later. 

2) Mutianus (actually Mut) was the head of the humanist circle 
in Erfurt, therefore Luther uses here the expression: 
Humanissimo, and later in the letter the address: Humanitas do 
what we have given by: "your love". 

3) This was initiated by Johann Lang's sending to Mutianus 
on May 2, 1515, the sermon Luther had delivered the day before 
at the meeting of the order in Gotha (Walch, St. Louis Edition, 
Vol. X, 938) with great praise of Luther. (Késtlin, M. Luther [3.], 
Vol. I, p. 129.)

namely Martin, who is unlearned and always used to 
cackle among the geese. But | know, but | am certain, but 
| even measure myself, that Mutianus prefers the heart to 
the tongue and the pen. Therefore my heart is learned 
enough, because it is friendly enough towards you.

This one thing | want to let you know: the father 
Baccalaureus Johann Lang, whom you know as a Greek 
and Latin, but what is greater than a man of sincere heart,

Langensaiza. May 29, 1516. 


To Joh. Lang, prior in Erfurt. 


Luther, still on the visitation journey, gives him regulations for 
the better management of the household in the monastery. 


1) Only the Codex, and after it the Erlangen correspondence, 
has the reading: subministraret, which seems to us to give nol 
puffing sense; therefore we have assumed submussitaret with the} 
other editions. 

2) Virg. Bucolica, Ecl. l, v. 56. 

3) Decanus Vicarius. Here Decanus must not be taken as 
"Decan of the theological faculty in Wittenberg", as De Wette did 
in his summary of this letter, because Carlstadt held this dignity a 
that time; it means "tenfold Vicarius", namely over the ten| 
monasteries mentioned in the previous number. It seems tha 
Luther wants to justify the lack of time for visits.

JEsus. 


Grace and peace 5) multiply upon you abundantly. It 
has occurred to me, dear father and my faithful co-worker 
in the work of the Lord, since | am now absent, what | did 
not think of when | was present, or if | had thought of it, | 
would not have considered or recognized it so great. But 
it is this, that the hospice (domus hospitum == the 
house of the guests) (which | have always considered 
something extremely dangerous in the monasteries, if it 
comes into abuse, although it is an extremely holy service 
of God, if it happens in the Lord) cannot be better judged 
and directed, than if it is observed with careful attention, 
what and how much is spent in it. Therefore, trusting in 
you, in which | have the confidence that you will do more 
than | desire, | do not command, but remind you in the 
Lord that you keep a special register, in which you record 
daily how much beer, how much wine, how much bread, 
how much meat, yes, how much of all things of every kind 
is consumed in the same [hospice]; | add: what has been 
spent for your dignity 6) or that of another. 


4) The Erl. Briefwechsel also notes here, as he did with the 
previous letter: with Aurifaber "in the wrong place". This remark is 
also in Léscher, Vol. |, 810 at No. 13. Aurifaber's oversight is this: 
he has this letter in the first place, then the one in No. 13. 
Aurifaber was somewhat justified to keep such order, because 
both letters are dated: "May 29, 1516". He has overlooked, 
however, that Luther was on this day rather in Gotha than in 
Langensalza. 

5) This apostolic greeting appears here for the first time in 
Luther's letters. Compare Luther's interpretation of this greeting in 
the detailed interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. Louis 
Edition, Vol. IX, 44, § 45 ff. 

6) This will refer to Lang's promotion to prior, which had taken 
place only shortly before. See the postscript to No. 13.

You shall not record there, but only that which is related 
to the common guests. 

The manner of this register, if you cannot invent 
something better, arrange so that you write in certain 
interspaces thus: on the day of this saint, or on such a 
weekday, after such a feast day, so much is consumed, 
namely in wine so much, in bread so much 2c., for such 
aN. or N. guests. Let not this be thought troublesome or 
superfluous; take heed well, | beseech thee, or | would 
command thee; peradventure thou knowest not my 
thoughts. For in such a way (if all common sense does 
not deceive me) you will see whether the convent is more 
a monastery than an inn or tavern. Yes, in this way you 
will not only be able to know how much has been 
consumed, but also to which people and on how many 
days you have been hospitable, finally also to which 
guests the works of reverence have been paid; but also 
the grumbling of the brothers can be countered, and 
accounts can be filed, or accused, and many other things 
that | do not say now. 

| would also like you to make a special and separate 
record for those who come and go out and bring their 
guests with them, so that the restless and insatiable 
people may be held accountable for how much they 
wastefully consume, while they are hopeful for the 
greatness of their benefits and their work. Fare well and 
be a strong man, and the Lord will be with you; remember 
also that you are set up as a sign that will be contradicted, 
to some a good smell to life, but to others a smell to death, 
and pray for me. From Sailza, on the eighth day after the 
Feast of Corpus Christi (May 29) in the year 1516. 
Brother Martin Luther. 

| have not found any monasteries in this district that 
are in as good order as, by the grace of God, the one at 
Gotha and the one at Salza. We heard this one in one 
hour, that one in about two. Therefore, we have finished 
quickly, and will, by the grace of God

temporal matters in these places without us, even though

Luther, having returned from his visitation trip, in response to

Staupitzen a bishop.

To the servant of God and servant of Christ, that is, to 
the extremely righteous priest, Magister Georg 
Spalatin, your highly learned man and his true 
friend. 

JEsus. 

Hail! As you asked, my best Spalatin, | have returned, 
thank God, at least unharmed in body, God knows 
whether also in mind. | therefore give thanks to your love. 
Your letter was also delivered to me immediately, 
because the brothers did not know where | was, so that 
they could have sent it to me. You also write that our most 
noble prince wishes that our reverend father should now 
become vicarius, | do not know what kind of high thing, 
and that he should also make use of you as a helper to 
bring this about; and you certainly do what a man who is 
a friend without hypocrisy is wont to do. But | wish that 
your persuasion of the venerable father will become 
sleepier and duller than a dry stubble, and | will advise in 
my letters what is contrary to you, or at least | will advise 
in such a way that he, when he is persuaded, should 
waver as to which way he should turn. 

Are you surprised about this? It is certainly true that | 
do not despise your advice,

because with the best will in the world | cannot help but 
believe that they come from a very good heart, yes, 
because | see that you are carried away by true love and 
therefore recognize that you are deprived of the right 
judgment. For true love does not find the right judgment, 
as Chrysostom says. But this | say, that the prince's 
desire has moved you to talk to him. For | do not want 
the venerable father in any way to get involved in this 
matter, which your persuasion is striving for with all its 
effort, because it pleases your prince so. Many things are 
pleasing to your prince, and shine with great brightness 
in his eyes, which are displeasing to God and are not 
good. Not that | want to deny that he is the very smartest 
in worldly affairs, but that | recognize that he is almost 
sevenfold blind in the things that concern God and the 
salvation of souls, just like your Pfeffinger. 1) 

And | do not say this in the corner, as a slanderer, nor 
do | want you to hide this in any way; | am ready, if 
somehow the opportunity gives it, to say it to both of your 
faces. But if it were certain that what is in your hands is 
from God, | wish that your persuasion would become fire 
and that one would become stubble. And don't let it come 
to you that what your prince and you are planning is so 
secret; | heard long before | saw your letter that the 
venerable father is being asked to be a bishop (if | 
remember correctly) "at Kimsehe" [Chiemsee] But this is 
what your letter and Pfeffinger's, and also that of his 
sister, the abbess,”) whom | saw at Eisleben, is about, if 
| have not had the wrong scent. 

But, my dear Spalatin, these are not times of such 
prosperity that it should be blissful, or rather extremely 
miserable, to be a bishop (praesulari), that is, to live in 
indulgence, sodomizing, and according to Roman ways, 
which you yourself sufficiently recognize when you 
compare the works and doings of the old bishops with 
the doings and works of the bishops of our time. At 


1) Degenhart Pfeffinger, a Bavarian nobleman from 
Alberskirch, Doctor of Laws and Counselor to the Elector. Cf. no.

2) Probably Magdalena, Staupitzen's sister. 


Now those are the best, who with all their strength and 
all their intrigues pursue quarrels before the court and 
build up the property (rem familiarem), that is, the 
insatiable hell of avarice. And even though this man is 
very far from all these vices, will you be a guarantor that, 
if the occasion arises, yes, if (as is now happening and 
being said everywhere) necessity drives him, this man 
will not be drawn into the whirlwinds and raging storms 
of the episcopal courts? 

But enough of that; | answer your request. If this 
matter is indeed such that it cannot suffer any delay, then 
| ask you to inform me immediately, because the 
venerable father is now in Antwerp and will hardly return 
before the autumn; but for his sake | will gladly send a 
messenger of my own as far as Cologne. For this is the 
place where he has instructed us to send letters to him. 
Fare well in the Lord, and pray for me. From our 
monastery in Wittenberg, on the eighth of June in the

Salvation and peace, but not the revealed one 
according to the sense of men, but the one hidden under 
the cross and exalted above all reason in the Lord! I reply 
briefly to your letter and that of the Teutonic gentleman 
who desires to be admitted to our Order, dear and 
venerable Father. First of all, that it is not our place to

It is not to hinder a beneficial intention, but rather to 
promote and encourage it, if care is taken that it is done 
with the Lord and in the Lord. But it will be done in the 
Lord, if one does not keep every man's mine and holy 
intention, but the prescribed law and the order of the 
superiors and the decrees of the fathers, without which 
he hopes in vain for prosperity and salvation for himself, 
however good his intention may be. 

Therefore, | do not give my consent, nor can | give 
my consent, to the admission of this gentleman, unless 
he brings properly sealed letters from his superior, and 
wants to do everything else, which, as is written in the 
16th chapter of our orders, must be done by such 
people, lest he cause himself and us to repent 
afterwards. For no one may be removed from his 
superior merely on the testimony of one. It is someone 
else's property until he who has power over it gives his 
consent in a lawful manner. If he would now hardly agree 
to produce such letters, behold, it will already come to 
light whether the spirit is of God. For that which is of God 
endures, and suffers and endures all things, that it may 
endure. 

Then about brother Henning, that you write that you 
gave him a vacation (/icentiam) on Tuesday after Vitus 
[June 17]: | have not yet seen him, nor has he come to 
me. | have ordered the brother Peter Hilperhausen to 
Sangerhausen instead of Andreas Ilmen, whom | have 
had admitted to Erfurt because of his weakness. The 
fathers in Sangerhausen have my letter to him, because 
| assumed that he would travel to Mansfeld, as he had 
asked me. 

You seek and desire peace, but in a wrong way, 
because you seek it as the world gives it, not as Christ 
gives it. Or do you not know, my dear father, that God is 
wonderful in his people because he has placed his 
peace in the midst of strife, that is, in the midst of all 
temptations? as he says [Ps. 110:2]: "Rule in the midst 
of your enemies." Therefore, it is not the peace that no 
one oppresses, but rather the peace that has 





of the world; but he whom all people and all things 
trouble, and bears all this calmly with joy. You say to 
Israel, Peace, peace, and there is no peace. Rather, say 
to Christ: Cross, cross, and is no cross. For as soon as 
the cross ceases to be across, than thou canst cheerfully 
say: Blessed cross, among all woods there is none such. 

See, therefore, how fatherly the Lord provokes you to 
true peace, since he surrounds you with such a great 
cross. For such is called the peace of God, which is 
higher than all reason, that is, which cannot be felt nor 
perceived, nor even thought. No thought can see and 
understand it. Only the one who gladly bears the cross 
in everything he feels, thinks, understands, such a 
afflicted one experiences this peace afterwards. For all 
our understanding, all our work, all our thoughts, he has 
ordered under this peace of his, and has fastened them 
to the cross (that is, subjected them to various and 
troubled disturbances); therefore peace is above reason, 
and different from that which we invent and desire, 
namely incomparably much better. Seek this and you will 
find it. But you cannot seek it better than by taking the 
troubles upon yourself with joy, as if they were holy relics, 
and not by seeking and choosing peace according to 
your opinion and sense. Fare well and pray for me, best 
father, and may the Lord guide you. From Wittenberg, in 
the year 1516 on the day of the ten thousand martyrs

Your venerable father Johann Lang, Baccalaureus of 
Theology, Prior of the Augustinian Hermits at 
Erfurt, his [friend] in the Lord. 

JEsus. 

Hail in the Lord! | have written a letter to you from 
Sangerhausen, dearest father, that if you had a brother 
who was unbroken in spirit, you might send him there for 
his punishment. 1) Now | am writing another letter to you 
from Wittenberg, and | do not only order, but | also ask, 
that you leave either Georg Schleusinger or Wilhelm 
Tischer to them in Eisleben, if not handed over, at least 
for the time being, until the venerable father has returned. 
For now necessity forces it, and you may tell this brother 
and all that this is not done by me out of a violent mind, 
but we all, especially |, are obliged to uphold the honor of 
the vicariate, especially of the venerable father vicarius, 
as and where we can. 

These very fathers have sent me a brother who was 
close to attaching a huge stain to this new plantation 2). 
The brother Caspar, who is senior there, has received 
the last ovation and is lying down, the Lector Antonius is 
also lying down, the father Baccalaureus 3) is in Leipzig, 
two others are on the journey 4) to collect for the building, 
as you know, and this one 5) is now here with me. Five 
priests are in total in the service of the convent: consider 
for yourself whether the need should not be helped. 

But so that you or others do not get a suspicion: the 
plague does not prevail there. Be well and greet the 
fathers, the magisters and the lector 6) and the others,

Two more Carmelite brothers 8) joined us. Brother 
Johann K6énigsberg has recovered completely. The prior 
of Herzberg has suffered severely from coughing and 
spitting up blood; | fear that he will not recover. Pray for 
him and command him to yours; he has not yet been able 
to hold the disputation for the baccalaureate. The storm 
and thunderstorm near Dresden destroyed most of the 
vineyards of our monastery in such a way that it is 
thought that the damage could hardly be repaired with 
two to three hundred florins; it also destroyed many 
others. This is the news.

To Spalatin. 


Luther asked Spalatin for the letters of St. Jerome or an 
excerpt of the life of the apostle Bartholomew from Jerome's Cat. 
viror. illustrium, since he wanted to preach a sermon on this 
subject. 


The original is in the Abbey Library of Zurich. Printed by 
Hottinger, Hist. eccl. tom. VI, p. 756; in Tentzel, "Historischer 
Bericht vom Anfang und ersten Fortgang der Reformation" 2c., p. 
163; in Strobel- Ranner, Lutheri epp., p. 33; in De Wette, vol. |, p. 
48 (without determination of the date) and in Erlanger 
Briefwechsel, vol. |, p. 46.

JEsus. 

Hail! | ask you for a service of both love and faith, my 
dearest Spalatin, that is, that you either help me at this 
hour to the letters of St. Jerome, or at least, as briefly 9) 
as possible, to the letters of St. Jerome. 


7) In contrast to the general vicar, Luther here calls himself 
vicarirt particularis == vicar of a piece. 

8) Their names were: Johannes Hais from Naumburg and 
Sixtus Maul from Bamberg, Album p. 62. The prior of the 
Augustinians from Herzberg is Simon Cesarmis, Album p. 64. 
Liber Decan. p. 19. 21. - "Kénigsberg" seems to be Fogler, Album 
p. 33. (Seidemann at De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 530, Amn. 2.) 

9) De Wette notes: "It can be doubted whether it is called 
breviter." - Perhaps celeriter, because Luther insists on the 
highest haste.

this blow on the right cheek, but also to offer it to the 
others. This will not be your greatest, but also not your 
last challenge. God's wisdom is only playing with you and 
preparing you for serious warfare if you live. It is nothing

To the venerable and devout Fathers, Brother 
Michael Dressel, Prior of the Convent of the 
Hermits of St. Augustine at Neustadt, together 
with the Seniors and Chapter Lords of the same 
Convent, his dearly beloved in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail in the Lord! | hear with sorrow, as | am worthy to 
hear, dear fathers and brethren, that ye live without 
peace and unity, and though ye are in one hand, have 
not one manner, nor, as the rule requires. Have one 
heart and one soul in the Lord. This wretched and 
useless way of living comes either from the weakness of 
your humility, because where there is humility there is 
peace, or from my negligence, or at least from your guilt 
and mine, because we do not complain before the Lord 
who made us, nor pray that he may guide our way in his 
sight, and lead us in his righteousness. He who errs, 
errs, errs who fails to guide himself by his counsel, much 
less others, but this must be obtained from God by 
humble prayer and godly disposition, as the Psalm 
[119:133.] 9) does: "Let my walk be sure in thy word." 
Thus Tobias taught his son [Cap.4, 20. Vulg.]: "Always 
give thanks to God, and ask Him to guide you in your 
ways." Therefore, because you did not do this or did not 
do it rightly, it is not to be wondered at that you were not 
guided but hindered. How now? There is danger in a life 
without peace, because it is without Christ, and is rather 
a death than a life. 

Therefore, | am forced to do absently what | did not 
want to do at the moment, and now | would like to be 
present very much, but | cannot. Therefore, with 
wholesome obedience, accept this decree of mine, if 
perhaps the Lord of Peace will deign to work with us. For 
the whole or the foremost cause of your confusion is that 
you are at variance with your head and prior, and this is 
more harmful than one brother being at variance with 
another. Therefore, by the authority of my office, | 
command you, Brother Michael Dressel, to take office 
and seal. 


9) Erl. Briefw., Ps. 119, 35.

By this authority | also absolve you from the office of a 
prior, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Spirit, amen. And by this letter, as one absent, | 
will have done to the absent what | would have done 
presently to the present. 

Nor do | want you to complain that | have judged you 
unheard and have not heard your excuses. For | believe 
very gladly that you have done everything you have done 
in the best opinion, and | can also in no way think that 
you have done anything intentionally and maliciously, by 
which this disturbance has been brought about; you have 
done as much as you have had grace. For this | give you 
thanks, and all your brothers; if they do not give you 
thanks, they displease me greatly. 

But this is what must comfort you, that it is not enough 
for a man to be good and godly for himself, but there 
must also be peace and harmony of others with him. 
Often the best works fail, and are justly condemned, in 
order that peace may be preserved: how much more are 
those not to be preferred to peace, which a man has 
done in good faith and with all diligence, and yet by them 
has not served peace! 

Therefore, after the prior has been absolved [from his 
office], | ask you, for the sake of Christ's mercy, to 
immediately be unanimously careful to elect three in 
order according to the statutes, namely, so that you do 
not (as | have often experienced useless elections and 
futile votes) mention one of them, nor does anyone 
among you give his vote to such a one, whom one cannot 
have, namely, who is already in office or otherwise not 
available. 1) For if one so votes, one loses time and 
labor, and the votes are given in vain. Therefore, it would 
please me if, before the election, all those who cannot be 
given to you were publicly enumerated, so that everyone 
would know to whom he should not give the vote. Nor is 
it a mistake for you to list some of those who can be given 
to you. 


For the sake of those who do not know about those who 
are to be chosen. 

But whomsoever ye shall choose, do this for him, 
brethren, with all diligence, that ye entreat, not with your 
strength, but with continual prayer, as | have said, that 
the Lord may guide you. For the scripture saith in 
Jeremiah [Cap. 10:23], "| know, O Lord, that the doings 
of man are not in his power, neither is it in any man's 
power how he shall walk, or how he shall direct his 
course." For behold, | testify to you by this present 
writing, and | tell you beforehand that unless you obtain 
a rule over you from God through prayer, you will not 
have peace and good prosperity, even if St. John the 
Baptist were your prior. Everything is in the hand of the 
Lord; whoever does not believe this will have plagues 
and troubles until he learns it. 

In the instruction of the young people, | ask you to be 
diligent and faithful, as in that which is first and highest 
for the whole convent, as | said and recommended to 
you when | was present. Be well and pray for me and for 
all of us. In the convent of Magdeburg the brother 
Johannes de Buscha (Busscha) died; the Subdiaconus 
in Dresden,” the father senior, Johann Kunzel. The 
plague is raging all around us, and we expect daily what 
the Magdeburgers are suffering. Therefore, be mindful 
of us and of those in Magdeburg, that whom He will call 
away. He calls in mercy. Be at ease in the Lord. From 
Wittenberg, Thursday after Mauritius [Sept. 25] 1516.

Furthermore, the prior of Erfurt, Johann Lang, sent me 
"the petition against the false theologians", which, since 
it contains nothing of truth based on facts (gestae

author, as the letters of the dark ones also have him. | 
approve of his intention (votum), but | do not approve of 
his work, because it does not abstain from invective and

the venerable Baccalaureus of sacred theology, Father 
Johann Lang, prior of the Augustinians, hermits at Erfurt, 
his [friend] to be highly honored in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail! [You act as if we indeed had such great 
abundance that |, who am poor, could receive those 
whom you, who are richer, cannot receive. For this winter, 
if the plague does not intervene, | will be the thirty-sixth, 
or even the fortieth, if all come who are indicated. You 
seem to me to assume much of the distrust and the 
Erfurtian idiosyncrasy, as if God could do that, that he 
does not also feed the ungrateful, and does not also 
sustain those who do not want to be sustained. 

Then you make this monastery your own in such a 
way that you call other people (alios) strangers and 
advise me to help my mother with you. Which is my 
mother and which is yours? See, therefore, how unjust 
zeal you have, that you want to serve her with your harm, 
but not her with your gain. Beware, therefore, that you 
persevere, as your Tauler says, as one separated on both 
sides, and in regard to everything [be] a common man, 3) 
as is proper. 


At the time of our letter, it had already been printed for some time 
and sent to Lang, as Luther reports here, by Amsdorf. - Between 
August 30 and October 5, Luther does not seem to have written 
a letter to Lang, because only on the latter day does he return to 
the remark made there about Staupitzen's stay in Munich, and 
only on October 5 in the postscript does he report to Lang the 
death of Johannes Kunzel in Dresden, about whom he had 
already written to the Augustinian chapter in Neustadt on 
September 25. - On October 5, nothing is said about the plague, 
but in our letter it is said that it comes gradually and at the 
beginning; on October 26, that it takes away several. - In the letter 
of October 5, the honorable reception of D. Goede in Erfurt is 
commemorated; in our letter in the postscript, however, his violent 
actions there are already mentioned. - Our letter has several 
points of contact with Luther's letter to Lang of October 26. The 
brother Johann Metzeler mentioned here is mentioned there 
again, as well as the two brothers sent from Cologne. According 
to the receipt of this letter, thirty-six to forty persons must be 
maintained in the Wittenberg monastery from the meager income; 
through the influx of new brothers received during the letter, the 
number increased to forty-one on October 26. 

3i Walch already remarks that here sis has to be added to 
make sense.

befits the son of the common God and the common 
church. | will give you the brother Johann Metzeler when 
| have learned that the Eislebeners can do without him. 

It is nothing that your Gabrielists 1) are surprised 
about my, rather Bartholomew's Feldkirchen thesis, 
since also mine are so far tremendously surprised about 
it. And of course the thesis itself is not made by me, but 
M. Bartholomew has put it that way, namely moved by 
the chatter of the yappers against my lectures. 
Therefore, he has arranged for this to be discussed 
publicly (except in the order in which | presided), in order 
to shut up the gossips or to hear the judgment of others. 
Of course, | have annoyed everyone very badly because 
| have denied that the book of true and false repentance 
2) is by Augustine. For it is quite tasteless and 
exceedingly inconsistent, and in everything far removed 
from Augustine's sense and learning. For | knew that 
Gratianus and Magister Sententiarum took a great deal 
from it, and made not a remedy for consciences, but a 
torture out of it. But it has so annoyed those people that 
they cannot be reconciled, especially Doctor Carlstadt, 
that | dare to deny this knowingly. You shall therefore tell 
my astonished or rather whimsical theologians that it is 
not to be disputed with me whether Gabriel says this, 
whether Raphael that, or Michael that. | know what 
Gabriel says, namely everything quite well, except where 
he speaks of grace, love, hope, faith, virtues; how much 
he pelagianizes there with his Scotus, | cannot now bring 
forward in writing. 

Of the third thesis, 3) which you say you do not 
understand, this is the opinion of the 


1) Followers of the scholastic Gabriel Viel. - About Feldkirchen 
compare St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, introduction, p. 26 f. He is 
from Feldkirchen in Swabia. He is from Feldkirchen in Swabia; 
born August 24, 1487, died July 21, 1551. He was not, as is 
usually assumed, the first married Protestant preacher, but 
others married before him. See Seidemann's "Explanations," p. 
13. 

2) This writing was the main authority for the penitential theory 
of the Middle Ages. Luther was right in doubting its authenticity; 
even Bellarmin declared it spurious. 

3) St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, 13. 


Magister Bartholomew: that love, which (as those bad 
theologians hold) awaits the utmost need, is inactive, 
yes, extremely inactive, that is, absolutely no love. Since 
love, forgetting itself, seeks what is external, how should 
it then await the utmost need,” since a human being, not 
wild animals nor the stone kind, is expected. Namely, the 
exceedingly astute theologians understand the word of 
John [1 Ep. 3, 17. Vulg.The apostle (ille) intended this: 
when someone sees that his brother is in need of 
something, or is in need of something; as the Lord was in 
need of the donkey and the stuffing, and as in the Acts of 
the Apostles [Cap. 2,45.] each one was given what was 
needed. 

Against this unbelieving view, which also extinguishes 
the whole love, he said: "a completely inactive love". 
From no other teacher have we taken this [thesis] than 
from him who says [Matt. 7:12.], "All things whatsoever 
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to 
them." But | mean, it could not be doubtful even to thuen, 
that though they thirsted not to the last breath, yet they 
wished to be watered by others, and that love would be 
injured if they were not watered; - but they should not 
injure love if they only offered [the drink] to one who 
would otherwise die of thirst? Therefore, when will the 
service of love occur? Who will prescribe when this need 
is there? These are monstrous things that moved M. 
Bartholomew because he had heard such things from 
me. Magister Amsdorf confesses that he sent this thesis 
to you with cut off titles 5); and he also wondered, but not 
anymore. 

There was no need to ask whether the novice 
brothers, dressed in white, would be able to see the 


4) It seems to us that instead of: expectat should be read: 
expectit,. - Equally following we have read with'all editions: cum 
hominis, ... expectatur instead of the reading of the Codex and 
the Erl. Briefw.: cum hoc ... expectat.

For if they administer the office in the monastery (intus), 
why not also outside? Have they adopted the clothes for 
the sake of the people and wear them? Therefore, they 
and the brothers as a whole are allowed to walk according 
to the statutes, in fact, they are allowed to wear their 
clothes. But in Italy (for this province this regulation is 
primarily given, or at least it is believed that all other 
[provinces] act in the same way) they always walk in black 
robes even in the monastery (intus), So that everywhere 
there is a difference between the novices and those who 
have made profession or have advanced higher. Thus | 
hold, but with reservation of the judgment of the superior. 

When the venerable father Vicarius has answered 
you, inform me as soon as possible; | will keep these 
brothers here for a few days to see what | can do or where 
the pestilence wants to go, which is arriving and starting 
all the time. | am reluctant to send them back, since they 
are suitable for study, but we are weighed down by lack; 
but the Lord lives and reigns. 

Against the Nuremberg Prior 1) put on a gentle mind, 
for that is serviceable, since he has put on a hard mind. 
For not a hard one casts out a hard one, that is, not the’ 
devil the devil, but a gentle one the hard one, that is, "the 
spirit of God" casts out the devils. 

Behold, at this very hour, as | write this, two brothers 
are coming to me from Cologne,” who are to study. | do} 
not know what the venerable father may think that he, 
without asking me, is showering me with brothers in this 
way; all our possessions can no longer provide either 
cells or other things. Fare well and pray for me, and 
command us yours that when the Lord calls some of us 
away, he may deign to call us away well prepared. From 
Wittenberg. 

Brother Martin Luther, Vicarius.

| want to write to Doctor Henning® , but lack of time 
prevents me from doing so. | am very sorry that he argues 
with his opponents more with violence than with humility 
and gentleness. For he follows the sense of Rehoboam 
[1 Kings 12], who despised good counsel, that he should 
act modestly, and in all that he did followed the counsel 
of the people of his own kind. | wish very much that this 
parable would be well considered by Doctor Henning. For 
| fear not only for him, but | fear that he may have come 
to Erfurt in vain, and that joy may be turned into sorrow.

monasteries under Luther's control mentioned in No. 12. - In 
Leitzkau near Magdeburg, the Augustinian monastery of 
Wittenberg owned a pond, the yield or income of which had to be 
received by the terminarius. 

3) There was a dispute between the Elector and the Herzberg 
City Council over the parish church incorporated into the 
monastery by the Elector, which the City Council reclaimed. 
Luther was the administrator for the Herzbergers.

Epistle to the Galatians. See St. Louis Edition, Vol. VIII, 1352, 
note.

in No. 21. - M. Spangenberg, inscribed in the winter semester of 
1508 as Frater Bethel de Spangenberg, Augustin, prior at 
Eschwege (cf. 
No. 21); later opponent of Luther at the Leipzig Augustinian 
Convention June 22, 1523; sent to Cologne in 1525 to reform the 
Augustinian monastery there, i.e., to expel the Protestant-minded 
friars. (Erl. Briefw.) 





| sent them with a younger [brother] to M. Spangenberg 
to their places, where they desired, so that they would 
not remain in this air, which is little beneficial to them. | 
have kept two others, together with the two men from 
Cologne, 10) with whose skill | have had such great pity 
that | would rather keep them, even with explicit harm, 
than send them back. Twenty-two priests, twelve young 
people, and a total of forty-one people feed on our more 
than exceedingly poor supply; but the Lord will provide. 

You write that you began the second book of the 
Sentences yesterday; but | will begin the Epistle to the 
Galatians 11) tomorrow, although | fear that the 
presence of the plague, after | have begun, will not allow 
it to continue. The plague in our country takes away at 
most (but not yet every day) three or two, and the 
blacksmith, our neighbor across the street, has buried a 
son today who was healthy yesterday, and the other son 
is down with the plague. What can | say? It's here and 
it's attacking all of a sudden, especially younger people. 
And you advise me, and M. Bartholomew with you, to 
flee. 12) Where shall | flee to? | hope that the world will 
not collapse when Brother Martin falls. The brothers, of 
course, if the plague increases, | will scatter all over the 
world; | am set here; out of obedience | am not free to 
flee until the obedience that commanded commands 
again. Not that | do not fear death (for | am not the 
Apostle Paul, but only a reader of the Apostle Paul), but 
| hope the Lord will pluck me out of my fear.

JEsus. 

Hail! If it is still in your and your fathers' mind, 
venerable father, to send the three brothers away,®) as 
you have written to me for the second or even the third 
time, then it has seemed good to me that they should no 
longer be let go. Therefore, | summon all three of them 
to Sangerhausen by my power and command and 
appointment for a while, if they want to get along again. 
And | would have sent them there a long time ago, 
because that convent had needed people for a long time, 
but | feared that they would be extremely useless to 
strangers, since they are not useful to their own. 

But now | have written to the prior there that he should 
receive them, and especially not let the brother Jakob 
Schlegel go out to collect gifts. 9) Now it must be tried 
what the Lord wants to work in them and in such a way. 
It is now up to you to immediately inform them of this 
commandment of mine and to encourage them to travel, 
as is customary. Fare well and pray for me. From 
Wittenberg, on the day after Simonis and Jude [Oct. 29]

Hail! Your letter, my dear Spalatin, was delivered to 
me just on the feast day of St. Lucia [Dec. 13], in which 
you, among other things, saw to it and reminded me that 
| should hand over to the Wittenberg bearer what | 
wanted to send to you or to Hirschfeld. For | wanted 
nothing more urgently than a certain bearer or reliable 
provider of the things to be sent. 

| have, of course, written two letters to the venerable 
Minorite Father Jacob, who is the confessor of Prince 
Frederick, that he should at the same time thank the 
Prince for having clothed me so generously, and with 
better cloth than is perhaps proper for a habit, if it were 
not a gift from the Prince: Cloth, than perhaps befits a 
habit, if it were not a gift from the Prince; and that he 
would like to inform him about the matter of the holy

Officialis 4) in this matter, of the same archbishop, and 
on the part of the prince and the vicarius the care has 
been entrusted to the subprior 5) of our monastery at 
Cologne to demand [relics) and raise them. Since, 
however, after the departure of the venerable father, the 
superior (Virgo Maxima) of St. Ursula was requested 
[for relics] by the aforementioned plenipotentiaries, the 
pope's prohibition protected her, and she could not, for 
the sake of conscience, let herself in without the pope's 
command and permission. Although a copy of the letter 
of permission was shown to her, she has rejected it until 
now, because the copy would not be authenticated and 
proven by the seal. Therefore, if you wish, you can 
indicate to our prince that he send a letter of permission 
of proven credibility, or that he may consider the 
venerable father vicarius excused. 

But that you write that the most noble prince has 
remembered me often and in an honorable way, | am not 
happy about that, but | pray that God the Lord will reward 
his humility with glory. For | am not worthy that any man 
should remember me, let alone a prince, and such and 
such a great prince; indeed, | see and experience that 
those benefit me most who remember me most 
grievously. But | ask you to let me give thanks through 
you, both for the favor and the good deed of this prince 
of ours, although | do not want to be praised by you or by 
any man, for the praise of man is vain, but the praise of 
God is true, as it is written: Not in any man, but "in the 
LORD shall my soul be praised" [Ps. 34:3, Vulg.], and 
again, Not in your name, but "in His holy name let 
yourselves be praised" [Ps. 105:3, Vulg.]. Not that our 
rulers are to be blamed, but rather that they are rulers of 
men as of God, to whom alone praise, honor and glory 
[be], auras.

Letters from the year 1516. No. 27. 28.

You want my judgment about your intention to 
translate small writings into German: there you demand 
something that goes beyond my powers. For who am | to 
judge what would both please and benefit the public? 
since that alone is a work of grace, that whatever pleases 
and benefits may please and benefit. Or do you not know 
that the more wholesome some things are, the less they 
please and benefit? What is more wholesome than Christ 
and the gospel? But to most they are stinking and a 
stench of death unto death, and to very few a stench of 
life unto life. Perhaps you say that in public you want to 
benefit only those who like the good. Here you no longer 
need my judgment, for the sheep always hear every voice 
of the shepherd, and only reject or flee the voice of 
strangers. Therefore, whatever you do, if it is only good 
and the voice of Christ, do not doubt it, will please and 
benefit, but only a few and very few, because the sheep 
are very few in this land of wolves. 

Above all, however, seek Christ's counsel and will 
through humble prayer, to whom even the good that is 
done without his command and will is not filled, as Isaiah 
says, Cap. 30, 1. [Vulg.]: "Woe to you, apostate children, 
because you have counseled without me, and not from 
me, and have begun a plot, and not by my Spirit." 
Therefore, do not follow your good and godly opinion (as 
the great multitude of monks and priests err everywhere 
and in the worst way), but ask for your permission, yes, 
for your command, especially in this and in all your work, 
if you do not want your work to become stagnant. But | 
also add my advice. If it pleases you to read pure, 
thorough theology, which is quite similar to the old one, 
written in German, then you can obtain the sermons of 
Johann Tauler, Order of Preachers, whose entire short 
epitome | send you, lo and behold, here. For | have seen 
no theology, either in Latin or in our language, that is 
more wholesome and more in harmony with the Gospel. 
Taste it therefore, and see how friendly the Lord is, after 





you have tasted before and seen how bitter everything is 
that we are only ever ourselves. Farewell and pray for 
me. From our monastery in Wittenberg, on the following 
Sunday after St. Lucius [Dec. 14] 1516. 

Brother Martin Luther, Augustinian.

Hail! | believe that your order will become lax, because 
all orders become lax and [the guardians] act 
mischievously, while those who are appointed guardians 
should act vigilantly. Therefore, if you cannot do anything 
with peace and good, | do not advise you to quarrel with 
the greater part of yours by force and obstinately, but 
give room to anger, and let the tares grow with your 
wheat; it is better to keep a few in peace, than to put 
everyone altogether in trouble because of many. And it 
is better to tolerate many for the sake of many than to 


spoil many for the sake of many. Brother Martin Luther. 
2) 


1) We have left this letter and the following one in the same 
order as it is found in Aurifaber. The Erlangen correspondence 
has reversed this order, because in the following one there is a 
clue for the approximate time determination, but not in this one. 
Namely, it is mentioned (in No. 20 towards the end) on 
September 25 that the plague is raging in Magdeburg and its 
environs, and no other reason for the mortality can be assumed 
than the plague, which is also mentioned in No. 23 and 25. That 
we have now given this letter the same time as the following one, 
is because we agree with Lucke's assumption in De Wette, Vol. 
lll, p. 571, that both are a letter from the middle of which 
something has fallen out, although Aurifaber has given the 
second one this superscription: Fragmentum ex alia epistola etc. 
All editions except the Erlangen Briefwechsel place both pieces 
in the year 1517. - In Leitzkau, also called "Kloster Liezke", was 
the provost of the Premonstratensian monastery Georg Mascov, 
for whom Luther already in 1512 composed the magnificent 
synodal speech on | John 5, 4. f.. See St. Louis edition, vol. IX, 
1728.

because the piece given here is obviously only the beginning of 
a letter.

But be strong in Christ, and be not moved, that the 
cattle and the bodies die. For these are more signs of 
grace than of wrath. For he is then most angry when he 
is not angry, as he says through Ezekiel [Cap. 16, 42. 
Vulg.], "I will no more be angry with thee, and my zeal 
shall be taken away from thee." This is something 
exceedingly frightening and said only to the hardened. At 
the end of the letter | beg you very much to pray to the 
Lord for me, for | confess to you that my life is getting 
closer to hell day by day, because | am getting worse and 
worse every day. Farewell. From Wittenberg.

The talk was about your excellence, goodness and 
erudition; apart from Martin, Otto 1) and Amsdorf, we 
missed very little. However, our very good friend 
preached about the final consummation of the eternal 
dispensation,” to such great applause of the people, 
to such a large audience that | hardly dare to say; so 
large that your church 3) often could not contain it. 
Those who excel in spiritual gifts among us praise

this far more glorious. Not only respectable citizens, 
but also the nobles and at least those who have the 
highest leadership of the commonwealth in their 
hands, considered it something nice to apply for his 
friendship, yes, they considered it an honor to offer 
themselves as guests and to have lunch with Doctor 
Staupitz uninvited. Those who did so gained favor, 
and rose higher in the same. The council is only 
concerned that he may not gain too little. In the last 
five years, during which | have served the Fatherland, 
no one has been so kindly, so sincerely, so 
benevolently honored; the whole city awaits his 
return: all to our Order's 4) immense honor. As for

request of the friends, Staupitzen's sermons, for 
God's glory and the salvation of the Augustinians,

faithfully translated, whose publication in both

JEsus. 

Hail! | have received your letter, highly learned and 
kind Christoph, which is indeed very pleasant to me, but 
also very distressing. Why are you frowning? For what 
could you have written me more pleasantly than that you 
have raised the venerable father, yes, Christ in his 
instrument, our Vicarius, with such well-deserved 
praise? For nothing can be more pleasing to me than 
that the word of Christ should be preached, heard, and 
accepted, nay, what is more, even lived, em

Nov. 11, 1481, at Nuremberg, died there June 14, 1542. He was 
never heartily devoted to the Reformation; after some years he 
turned away from it completely and entered into ever closer 
contact with its enemies. In 1528, he even offered to provide 
Duke George of Saxony with a copy of Luther's letter to 
Wenceslaus Link of June 14, 1528, which gave rise to "Luther's

and understood. Again, what could you write more bitterly 
than that you desired my friendship and honored me with 
so many quite trivial titles? | do not want you to become 
my friend, because this friendship will not be for your glory 
but for your danger, if the saying is true: Friends have 
everything in common. If then through this friendship 
mine becomes thine, thou shalt not be richer in any thing 
than in sins, and likewise in iniquity and dishonor. For 
these are my things, which (as | have said) thou hast 
adorned with the opposite titles. But | know that you are 
Christian-minded, and will say: Not you, but Christ do | 
admire in you. To this | say: How can Christ, the true 
righteousness, be in sins and unrighteousness? Yes, this 
is the highest presumption, when someone has the 
presumptuous opinion of himself that he is Christ's 
dwelling place, and this glory cannot easily be granted to 
any other state than the apostolic. Therefore, | wish you 
happiness in the desired circumstance that you are 
connected with this man, our father, through friendship 
and intimate contact: but take care of your honor, and, | 
beg you, do not be out of sorts, and put yourself into my 
friendship, although even this same venerable father, not 
without my fear and danger, praises me everywhere and 
says: | praise Christ in you, and | am forced to believe it. 
But this is a difficult faith. For this is a misfortune of this 
exceedingly miserable life, that the more rulers and 
friends there are, and the more closely they are 
associated with us, the more harmful they are, as it is 
written [Matt. 10:36.], "A man's enemies shall be his own 
householders," and again [Ps. 102:9. Vulg.], "They that 
praised me sware against me," and [Ps. 38:12. Vulg.], 
"My friends and my neighbors stood afar off from me, and 
stood against me." For God's favor recedes as much as 
man's favor is added. For God wants either to be alone 
or not to be a friend. To make matters worse, if you 
humble yourself and refuse praise and favor, the more 
praise and favor you will receive.

Favor (that is, danger and destruction) follows it. How 
much more salutary is hatred and blame than all praise 
and love, since hatred is only once a danger, but love is 
twofold danger. Nothing is more like a loving, even a 
senseless woman, who, when she is rejected, desires all 
the more furiously than this temporal praise and glory. 
See, therefore, with how much effort Solomon, Proverbs 
7 and elsewhere, dissuades me from this adulterous and 
wicked woman, whom he describes as a stranger, a 
foreigner and a seductress of the young. 

| am not writing this, my dear Christoph, as if | wanted 
to despise your sincere and benevolent mind, but 
because there is also something to fear for my mind. You 
fulfill the task of a godly and Christian man who should 
despise no one entirely but himself; but |, too, must strive 
to be a Christian similar to you (if the friendship is to 
become a firm one), that is, a despiser of myself. For not 
he is a Christian who regards a man because of his 
learning, virtue, holiness, fame (for this is also done by 
the pagans and paltry poets, as they also give their 
names in our time), but he who loves the meager, the 
poor, the foolish, the sinner and the wretched, as the 
Psalm says M. 41,2]: "Blessed is he that taketh care - not 
of the learned, the highly educated, the holy, the well- 
fortified, but - of the needy" and of the poor and the like. 
Yes, Christ confesses that what was done to His least 
was done to Him, whereas He could have said: to the 
greatest and to His high ones; "for what is high among 
men is an abomination in the sight of God" [Luc. 16:15]. 
To this abomination, | beg you for the sake of Christ our 
Lord, do not drive me and force me, if you want to be a 
friend. But you can do this very easily if you do not praise 
me to my face or before others in any respect. If you really 
think that Christ must be praised in me, then also mention 
his name and not mine. Why then should the cause of 
Christ be defiled by my name, even deprived of his? If no 
one speaks of things other than by their own names, then 
why should the cause of Christ be stained? 





men, why then do we praise the things of Christ without 
the name of Christ? See how talkative your friend is, 
therefore be a patient friendly reader. Fare well in Christ.

To his Georg Spalatin, the exceedingly righteous servant 
of Christ and friend. 


JEsus. 

Hail! | thank your very good heart, my dear Spalatin. 
For this alone | regard, which is rightly preferred to all gifts. 
Incidentally, that you wish me to indicate to you what you 
should primarily read in these days: according to my 
judgment, either Augustine on the grace of the New 
Testament to Honoratus, in which he at the same time acts 
the 22nd Psalm, [Vulg.] "My God, my God, look at me" 2c., 
which is appropriate for this time, or Hilarius on Octonarius, 
4) and Cyprianus in his Homilies is not inappropriate either, 
or Augustine on John from the 13th chapter where the 
incidents of these days begin. | will take pains, if | can, that 
tomorrow | teach that Christ is seen as [the representative] 
of men in any piece. 5) Be well. [On the day before Char 
Friday (April 9, 1517). 6)

To Christoph Scheurl. 


This letter is the answer to No. 35. Luther thanks Staupitzen for 
the writing sent to him, considers his own work on the Penitential 
Psalms not worthy of dissemination, and sends Carlstadt's theses. 


The original is in the Scbeurl family archive in Nuremberg. 
Printed by Schwarz, in his program (see No. 31), p. 6; by Schitze, 
Vol. Il, p. 13; by Strobel-Ranner, p. 36 ; by De Wette, Vol. |, p. 54 
and in Erlanger Briefw., Vol. I, p. 96. Teutsch by Walch, Vol. XX1, 
S72: 


4) The 119th Psalm is meant, which consists of octonaries, that 
is, divisions of eight verses each. Luther himself calls it Octonarius. 
See St. Louis edition, 

Vol. V, 1252, note. 

5) In the original, the reading here is: Christum in quoquo 
hominum videri, whereas in the editions (except the Erl. Briefw., 
which reproduces the original): Christum in cruce quoque hominem 
videri. - The assumption of the Erl. Briefw., that "die Predigt vom 
Leiden Christi", St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1176, does not belong to 
the year 1518, but to the year 1517, seems to be correct. 
Accordingly, we have accepted the time determination of this letter 
given in all editions. 

6) This time designation is missing in the original, but is included 
in all editions except the Erl. Briefw.

Your esteemed Mr. Christoph Scheurl, doctor of both 
rights, defender (patrono == advocate) of the 
citizens of Nuremberg, his! true friend in Christo. 


JEsus. 

Hail! First of all | thank you, dear man, for your gifts, 
namely the writings of Staupitz, 1) but | am sorry that my 
little works are spread among you by the venerable father 
[Staupitz]. For they were not published — for 
Nurembergers, that is, for finely educated and 
exceedingly clever people, but for the coarse (as you 
know) Saxons, to whom the Christian doctrine cannot be 
presented and chewed over with however many words. 
But, even if | wanted to, | could not manage anything that 
would be bearable to Latin ears: how much less now, 
since | have deliberately wanted to serve the slow 
understanding of the common people. Therefore, | ask 
you to remove them from the eyes of learned men as 
much as you can. By the way, as far as your reminding 
me that | should write to our corner in a friendly manner 
is concerned, | have done so with the greatest possible 
care; whether the letter has reached it, | do not know. 

These sentences, which are called theses, | send to 
you, and through you to the father Magister Wenceslaus 
(link), and if there are others who delight in this kind of 
delicacies. It is these (if | am not mistaken) not exactly 
Cicero's 3) paradoxes, but of our Carlstadt, rather of St. 
Augustine, which are so much more admirable and 
worthy than Cicero's, than Augustine, rather Christ, is 
worthier than Cicero. But these paradoxes punish all their 
carelessness. 


1) The booklet mentioned in No. 30, von der Versehung, both 
in Latin and in German, which has meanwhile been completed in 
print and, as only we learn here, was sent to Luther as a gift from 
Scheurl, your editor. That this writing was already in Luther's 
hands before, we see from No. 34. 

2) The Seven Penitential Psalms, St. Louis Edition, Vol. IV, 
1654. 

3) Cicero wrote Paradoxa ad M. Brutum. - On the Sunday of 
Misericordias Domini (April 26), when the solemn display of the 
relics took place in the collegiate church at Wittenberg, Carlstadt 
proposed 152 theses for a disputation, which was held to glorify 
this day. (Jager, "Carlstadt," p. 7.)

or ignorance, to whom they may have seemed more 
paradoxical (whimsical) than orthodox (orthodox), to say 
nothing of those whom they will rather condemn with 
insolent sacrilege as bad propositions (cacodoxa), who 
read neither Augustine nor Paul, or read in such a way 
that they do not understand him, and neglect themselves 
and others with them. They are therefore strange 
propositions (paradoxa) for the limited and those who do 
not know them, but good propositions (eudoxa) and 
beautiful propositions (calodoxa) for those who know 
them, but for me the very best propositions (aristodoxa). 
Praise be to God, who again commands the light to shine 
out of the darkness. 

| assume that the venerable Father Vicarius is not with 
you, but we are expecting his arrival. The Doctor Kilian 
Reuters has departed from mortal life; God grant that he 
may be in eternity. 5) Amen. 

Greetings from Amsdorf and all the friendly 
cooperative. We greet again through you all who deserve 
to be greeted. Farewell. From Wittenberg, May 6, 1517.

If you are so kind that you do not punish such a 
transgression with eternal imprisonment or with 
immediate death penalty, it seems to me that you should 
impose all your severity on him. For it is not you, but 
justice and the law, over which you are not a judge, but 
its servant, who punish in this way. Therefore you need 
not be moved by the fact that you are either an equally 
great or a greater sinner; it is enough that this should be 
known to God. But here, for the sake of building, we must 
almost always punish people who are better than we are, 
teach more learned ones, preside over more worthy 
ones, so that the saying of the Lord may stand [Luc. 22, 
25. f.], that the rulers of the Gentiles rule over their own 
as over their inferiors, but the rulers of the faithful serve 
them as their superiors. He who is greatest among you, 
he says, be your servant 2c. Therefore keep hearty 
humility and kindness toward him, but show severity of 
hand and violence, for your violence is not yours, but 
God's; but the humility must not be with God, but with 
you. Who knows whether he was not allowed to make the 
stink of his sin public for the sake of it, because the 
hidden thing could not be healed, which can very well be 
healed by public shame. God is wonderful in His 
counsels over the children of men. He heals many from 
sins by sins, as one poison is cast out by another. 
Therefore, do not be frightened; it is the Lord who works 
all this; praise and love him, and pray for that poor man 
and for me all the more devoutly. Fare thee well. From 
Wittenberg, given on Sunday Vocem Jucunditatis [May 
17] 1517.

At Staupitzen's command, Luther recommends several 
studying brothers to him and challenges him to obtain the dignity 
of licentiate.

To his brother Johann Lang, Prior of the Hermits of 


St. Augustine in Erfurt, Baccalaureus of Theology, 
his beloved in Christ. 
JEsus. 

Hail! These studying brothers, venerable father, are 
recommended to you by the venerable father Vicarius, 
yes, by the Lord Jesus in him. Receive them, therefore, 
and see to it that they increase on both sides, as the Lord 
Jesus sees fit to do for you. It is also the express and firm 
will of the venerable father Vicarius that you, as soon as 
it can happen and time permits, receive the dignity of a 
licentiate of theology, which the same has also ordered 
you orally in Eisleben, and now announces in writing 
from the gates of heaven, 1) so that you know that the 
venerable father desires not words, but action. Fare well 
and pray for me. From Heaven's Gate, Aug. 6. 

Brother Martin Luder, Augustinian. 

These brothers have five gold florins; see that they 
show them to you and that an account is kept for the 
vestments to be purchased. And if they need anything 
more, spend it for them, on account of the venerable 
father Vicarius, who has ordered that this be inserted in 
this letter. For it will be faithfully returned to you. 
Farewell.

To Joh. Lang. 


Luther offers to discuss the theses sent by Otto Beckmann in 
Erfurt. At the same time, he sends his sermons on the Ten 
Commandments for use in the pulpit and reports the death of the 
Antonite preceptor Johannes.

paragraph should be improved: "| believe that you know that 
Magister John, the Antonite preceptor, died at Brieg" 2c.

To Christoph Scheurl. 


Luther reported that he had given away some of Staupitzen's 
writings and sold some of them, and that he wanted to use the 
proceeds, which were intended for the poor, for himself and his 
brothers. He orders more copies, which he wants to pay for, and 
sends his theses against scholastic theology. 


The original is in the Scheurl family archive. Printed by 
Schwarz in his program, Altorf, p. 7; by Schutze, vol. Il, p. 15; by 
Strobel-Ranner, p. 39; by De Wette, vol. |, p. 61 and in Erl.

from Nuremberg (Scheurls Briefb., Vol. Il, No. 1385 and 136). 
Since Luther writes again to Scheurl on September 11, as to a 
friend he "recently met" (No. 45), and Otto Beckmann had 
traveled to Erfurt before September 4 (No. 44), the date we have 
set according to Erl. Briefw.

To his special friend, the highly learned and finely 
educated man Christoph Schenrl, Doctor of Both 
Laws, the respected Nuremberg advocate, his 
sincerely esteemed [friend]. 
JEsus. 

Hail! Although, dearest Christoph, | had no occasion 
to write to you that seemed worthy that | should write to 
you, such an important man, this has nevertheless been 
a sufficiently great motive for me that, putting aside the 
titles of your high dignities with which you are adorned, | 
wrote to a friend, and indeed to such a friend who is pure 
and completely sincere and exceedingly friendly, and, 
what is most to the point, only recently got to know and 
found. Therefore, if silence is to be counted as a fault 
anywhere, the silence of one friend against another is to 
be respected as such, since dallying and joking do not 
warm up friendship any less, not to say complete it, than 
doing serious things. Yes, this is precisely what St. 
Jerome urges on his friend, namely, that he write that he 
has nothing to write. Therefore, it has also been my 
intention now that | would rather say unrhymed things to 
a friend than remain silent. But, dear God, when does 
this brother Martin, who is falsely called a theologian, 
ever write anything in which he does not speak 
unrhymed, since he has not at all increased in the things 
that belong to an educated language under the din and 
confusion of reasoning, so that even if he has ever tasted 
something of erudition or eloquence, the very long and 
constant use in writing has brought this completely back 
to childhood and slurring. But this is already enough and 
over enough of prefaces, so that | do not rather seem to 
write a whole book than a letter, that is, to be nonsensical 
even in unrhymed speeches and twofold, since it is 
already too much for a theologian to be nonsensical 
once. The purpose of this letter is that you may realize 
how high an opinion | have formed of you and your 
faithfulness, not that | demand the same for myself from 
you, since | certainly believe that | already possess this,

but only that you keep yourself convinced that you cannot 
promise yourself wavier from me than you could from 
yourself. 

But meanwhile it occurs to me that you have sent me 
the writings of the venerable father Vicarius through this 
Ulrich Pinder 1) almost to the value of two gold florins, 
which | have admittedly partly sold, partly given to good 
friends of the venerable father for free; but the money 
which | have redeemed from the sold ones | have (as you 
have ordered) given to the poor, that is, to myself and to 
the brothers, because | have not yet got to know a poorer 
person than myself. By the way, | ask that, if it can be 
done, | be sent some of the same books, through your 
good will, for one guilder, which | will faithfully repay you 
when they are sold. For there are people who desire and 
expect these books. | also send our theses,?) which are 
quite strange (paradoxas), and as it seems to many, 
very bad sentences (xxxxxxdocus), which you can 
present to our corner, the very learned and perceptive 
man, so that | may hear and see what name he gives 
them. Many greet you and remember you best, especially 
the licentiate Amsdorf, Doctor Hieronymus (Schurs, and 
a certain part of your friendship, the well-known Peter 
Barbierer. 3) Fare well and pray for me. From Wittenberg, 
1517, on the eleventh of September.

To Martin Luder, Augustinian (Aurelianum 4) 

theologian. 

Hail in Jesus Christ! That you write to me in 
friendship and excuse your silence, venerable father, 
highly learned man, you certainly do well, because | 
am, as many know, an Augustinian who considers it 
very shameful to be defeated in love. This is also 
testified by Wenceslaus [Link], our special friend, the 
good and learned man. He has not only as listeners, 
but also as guests at the table, the Losunger 5) 
Hieronymus Ebner and the Septemvir Hieronymus 
Holtzschuher, since the venerable father Vicarius, 
through his famous virtue, has an extraordinary 
reputation among our nobles, whom he has brought 
to the point that they are certainly very devoted and 
favorable to the Augustinians (Aurelianis); this is not 
only to our honor, but also to our benefit. Among the 
rest, the Losunger, of whom | have spoken, 
Hieronymus Ebner, distinguished by his erudition and 
holiness, stands out, if | am not mistaken, the honey 
and the delight of the Nuremberg people, a man who 
is above all exceedingly affable and irreproachable. 
He also takes pleasure in your excellence; at table he 
often hears and talks about dix; he has the 
Decalogue,® the disputations and the other results of 
Luther's untiring activity (vigilias) in his hands, reads 
and admires them. Like you, he has nothing in mind 
but Christ and the commonwealth. Not only to this 
superior of the community, but also to me, you would 
do the most pleasant service, which would certainly 
not be unworthy of you at all, if you would attribute 
something Christian to him, 7) as you tend to do either 
publicly or privately. The other circumstances 
concerning this man you have learned from the 
biography of Anton KreB 8).

passage together with the words in the letter to Lang, from Sept. 
4, 1517 (St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. XVIII, 28): "| have sent you the

would like to assume that this writing did not appear in print only

To My Most Gracious and Dear Lord, Duke Frederick, 
Elector of Saxony, at Your Grace's Hand. 


Most gracious Lord and Prince! When E. F. G. 
promised me before this year through the Hirsfelder to 
give a new dress, so | come now and ask F. G. to be 
mindful of the same. 

But ask, my lord, as before, if Pfeffinger is to deliver 
this, that he deliver it by deed and not by friendly promise; 
he can almost spin good words, but will not make good 
cloth out of them. 

It has also been revealed to me, my lord, namely 
through the prior 1) at Erfurt, who understood it from E. 
F. G.'s confessor, how E. F. G. should have received

many words not different, which we had the evening full 
E. F. G., because that E. F. G. is a dear prince to him, 
and is indeed especially favorable to E. F. G., so that he 
finally said: "| do not think that | have ever angered my 
most gracious lord, | would have done so because | loved 
S. G. too much. Therefore, | ask, my lord, for his sake, as 
he also recommended it to me several times, that E. F.

F. G. has undoubtedly often found the same in him.

Hail! Your letter, which you addressed to me on 
November 3rd, highly learned and highly 


80 


The letter from you, my dear man, has shown your 
sincere heart, which is far more benevolent than our 
merits, towards ours and my humble self. But also the 
letter itself, a true reflection of your heart, was nothing 
else than sincerity and indicated nothing else than a 
sincere man. | rejoice and give thanks to the Lord Jesus 
that your Nurembergers, especially the nobles, so 
venerate and honor the venerable Vicarius and his (as 
you write) happy emulator, our Wenceslaus, and do this 
not out of any carnal intention or respect for persons, as 
the common people are wont to do, but out of a right love 
of salutary knowledge and out of zeal for the word of 
grace. | pray that the Lord will strengthen the work he has 
begun and also accomplish it, amen. 

By the way, that you admonish me for the second time 
that | should honor my studies and produce something 
from my workshop for Hieronymus Ebner, the regent 
(moderatorem) of your famous city (since | cannot 
honor his name through my studies, but rather his name 
through my studies), you give me too much credit and 
assume too much of me. For | do not lack the desire and 
the effort to serve him to the highest degree and to be at 
your will, but it is not within our capabilities, nor do | 
consider myself worthy of such an honor. You have 
high opinion of my studies, but | have a very low one. And 
although | must believe that you mean it quite faithfully 
from your heart, | am much more obliged to estimate my 
powers correctly myself. Yes, that | confess it to you 
straight out, | have begun to want to follow you 
memories, and already searched around everywhere, 
what | could probably take in front of my hand first. And 
behold, everything that met me in my entire stock (o 
which | never realized that it was so poor) was bad and 
seemed to me quite unworthy that it should be dedicated 
to such a great man of mine, such a small person. For i 
was not only my great ignorance, in which | seemed to 
know nothing, that prevented me from doing so, but also} 
another thing, namely my impiety, in which

me, since | deserve it very well, and henceforth refrain 
from praising me. 

Your housemate, the bearer of the letter, has told me 
that you have again had the kindness to send the books

Luther answers the question whether other women than the 
Marys came to the tomb of Christ, and how the Marys were, and 


touches on acontroversy (of Wimpina against Egranus) about the 
legend of St. Anne.

Now, with regard to what you ask, first of all: whether 
there were other women at the tomb of the Lord besides 
those Marys? you have a clear text Luca at the last, not 
far from the beginning [Cap. 24,10.], where it says: "Now 
there was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary 
Jacobi, and others with them, who told these things to the 
apostles" 2c. Yes, there seem to have been many, 
especially those whom he lists in the eighth chapter [v. 
2.f.] as those who followed the Lord, of whom he again 
said at the end of the 23rd chapter [v. 55.), "But the 
women followed, which came with him out of Galilee," 
and in the beginning of the last chapter [v. 1]: "But on the 
Sabbath very early they came to the sepulchre, bearing 
the specimens which they had prepared" (at any rate the 
very same ones of whom he had just before said that they 
followed him), and in the Greek it is added here: "and 
some with them", 1) as Laurentius Valla and Erasmus 
testify, and these "some" seem to me to be others than 
those mentioned before. 

The other: how many Marys were there? It is certain 
that it can be clearly proven from the Gospel that there 
were only two Marys besides the mother of the Lord, 
namely Magdalene and Mary Jacobi. For it is an obvious 
error that Mary Salome is any other?) than Salome 
herself. For Salome is the name of a woman, not of a 
man, the feminine of the masculine, which is called 
Solomon. Therefore also from Josephus that Salome is 
known, the sister of Herod the Great. Read Matthai Cap. 
20, 20. where the mother of the children of Zebedee 
comes to Christ, where Chrysostom says: This is 
Salome. And Marci 10,35. calls the sons of Zebedai by 
name: John and Jacobus. But John Cap. 19, 25. calls the 
Mary of Cleophas [wife] the sister of the mother of the 
Lord. 

But the same [namely as Maria Cleopha] is Maria 
Jacobi. Because Matth. 13, 55. and Marci 6,3. are called 
Jacobus, Joses, Juda 

1) These words are missing in the Vulgate. 

2) Instead of nullam in all editions, ullam is to be read. See 
Luther's shorter interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. 
Louis edition, vol. VIII. 1404: "Therefore the error of those is quite 


evident who have invented a third Mary, whom they call Mary 
Salome." 





and Simon are enumerated as brothers of Christ, that is, 
as mother-sister children of Christ, because they are sons 
of the sister of His mother. Therefore John Cap. 19, 25. 
calls this Mary the "Mary of Cleophas", Marcus Cap. 16,°) 
1. "Mary Jacobi"; the latter names her after her son, the 
latter after her husband" And see also that John alone 
names Mary Magdalene at the tomb, Matthew two, 
namely Mary Magdalene and the other, Mary Cleopha or 
Jacobi; Marcus three: Mary Magdalene, Mary Jacobi, and 
Salome; finally Lucas very many. For also Matthew [Cap. 
28,1.] said: "the other Mary", without name, to indicate 
that there was one and another; only two. 

| hear that D. Conrad Wimpina 5) | do not know what 
he is planning against the preacher in Zwickau§) because 
of this very thing, namely because he refutes the history 
of St. Anne, and especially proves against those three 
Marys. It seems difficult to me, however, that the latter 
[Egranus] can be refuted, although | do not want this 
history to be dispelled by argument, but rather, for the 
sake of the people, that it gradually grow cold in itself and 
cease, especially since this error, which comes from a 
godly mind (p/etate), is not so much to be condemned as 
that according to which the saints are venerated for the 
sake of money. Farewell in Christ, my dear Spalatin.

Dec.] 7) 1517.

3) Incorrect in the editions: "cap. VI." 

4) Instead of Mary in all editions, marito is to be read. See the 
genealogical register of Christ, St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 2084, § 
136. Likewise the passage of the interpretation of the Epistle to 
the Galatians cited above. - Subsequently, the Erl. Briefw., vol. Il, 
p. 336 in the misprint index: "it is probably to be read a marito". 

5) Wimpina, actually Koch, professor of theology at Frankfurt 
a. O., born 1460 at Buchheim near Wimpfen (hence Wimpina), 
died 1531. About him see St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, introduction, 
p. 12 b. - About Egranus ibid. p. 216, and vol. XV, appendix, no. 
42, Col. 2465. 

6) In 1518 appeared Wimpina's writing: De divae Annae 
trinubio et trium filiarum ejus asservatione Ibb. ll. Here Luther 
does not speak of the already published, but of the first intended 
writing. 

7) Burkhardt's remark on this date (p. 9): "falsch reducirt", is 
erroneous.

they are to be punished for not seeking worthier things. 
Therefore it is a mistake that we promote the service of 
the saints through the fear of evils and the desire for 
temporal goods. For this is not to be said and persuaded 
to all in general, as it is done, but, as | have said, to the 
children and the weak’; but to others it is to be persuaded 
that they seek from the saints the opposite, namely, 
torment, sickness, scourging, the cross, and all kinds of 
plagues, as David (ille) says [Ps. 26:2.]: "Try me, O Lord, 
and try me; purify my kidneys and my heart." Now, if we 
were all to take hold of what belongs to only a few, would 
not everything have to be filled with superstition? Let this 
be milk for the weak; let the strong work solid food. You 
see, therefore, that it is a superstition and not a 
superstition to worship the saints for the sake of bodily 
things. Those who can desire spiritual things, and see 
that they are lacking in them, undoubtedly obtain bodily 
things under God's wrath by neglecting to ask for the 
good Spirit. Yes, the Our Father teaches us in the first 
three petitions to ask first for what is spiritual and what is 
God's, and then for what is ours. But it is certain that this 
prayer will be perverted by those who do not care 
whether God rules or serves, and seek only to be 
delivered from their evil, making the first the last and the 
last the first. Fare well and pray for me. From Wittenberg, 
on the day of St. New Year's Eve 1518 [Dec. 31, 1517].

1) Because all previous editions except the Erl. Briefw. place 
this letter in the year 1518, also Burkhardt does not note anything 
about it, we come back again to the time determination. It seems 
impossible to us that Spalatin could have addressed the question 
answered in this letter to Luther at the end of the year 1518, after 
Luther's writing: "Die zehn Gebote, dein Volk zu Wittenberg 
gepredigt" 2c. had appeared in print. Yes, Luther would have 
referred Spalatin to this writing instead of an answer. One reads 
in the St. Louis edition, Vol. Ill, Col. 1159 to 1169; we are 
convinced that the correctness of this remark of ours will be 
acknowledged.

| am actually writing the very decisive defense of Erasmus 
against Faber Stapulensis: so that you know what you 
should recommend to your booksellers who will travel to 
Frankfurt. Further, | ask for the Utopias of Morus and the 
Hebrew teachings of Fabricius, but most of all for that 
apology, if it is not the same one that we have had here 
for a long time, 5) namely, that on the sixth verse of the 
eighth Psalm: "Thou hast made him lack a little time of 
angels" [Heb. 2, 7.];® in this matter it is to be regretted 
that so great chiefs of the good sciences argue against 
each other with so great impetuosity. Whether it be 
another, or whether it be printed in another manner and 
increased, | desire to see. The one | have has never been 
printed by a Basel press. 7) 

We desire of thee, O Greek,®) that thou decide our 
controversy as to what difference or distinction there is 
between xxx 

xxxx with epsilon and with eta, and why the Greek 
dictionaries do not have xxxxxxx with short penultimate 
syllable (penultima), since this is found everywhere in 
the New Testament, as, Rom. 9,9 3., 1 Cor. 12, 3. and 
Gal. 1 [v. 8. 9.] twice. Only that Erasmus uses Rom. 9 with 
an eta in the notes, while it stands in the text with epsilon, 
and is not found in the dictionaries other than with eta. | 
do not know the form of the letters, 10) otherwise | would 
give my judgment to your judgment. 


5) It was the same; the first edition was published in August 
1517. (Erl. Briefw.) 

6) Faber had claimed that the Epistle to the Hebrews was 
originally written in Hebrew, and that the translator had 
interchanged the correct with. Erasmus refuted this in his 
Annotationes in Novum Testamentum, printed in 1515. Erasmus 
responded to Faber's vehement rebuttal with his Apology. 

7) In February 1518, a second edition of the Apologia ad 
Jacobum Fabrum Stapulensem was published by Joh. Frobenius 
in Basel (Panzer, Annal. V|, 204, No. 214.) Whether the first 
edition was also published there, we do not know. 

8) In Walch: "We ask of you Greek." Immediately following 
XXXXXXX penultirna correpta is so given: 

"Anathema not in the last syllable without a short have." 

9) In the editions: Rom. VIII, but there this word does not occur. 

10) figuras literarum pingere. This is difficult to explain, It 
seems to us the reading is corrupted. Perhaps it should be read 
instead of pingere. After that we have translated.

Luther complains that he did not send the indulgence thesis to

Direr for a gift, and praises Staupitzen's writing "von der Liebe

Hail! The other day we were at Doctor Carlstadt's, 
dearest Spalatin, and began to discuss what you had 
already presented to us long ago, namely the new”) or 
lectures to be established at our university. And that | 
have not written to you about this for a long time is the 
reason that it seemed to us almost all to be a matter in 
which we would have to despair, especially because we 
fear that our most noble prince would be burdened with 
such great expenses. But so that you and your will may 
be satisfied, | send you a note here, in which you can read 
what seemed good to us at that time. But, if in such a way 


1) This writing originated from sermons that Staupitz had held 
in Munich during Advent 1517, and appeared under the title: "Am

2) We have followed the reading of the Erl. Briefwechsel: 
initiandis, instead of mutandis in the other editions. 


If our educational institution could be established, dear 
God, how great an honor that would be for our prince and 
for our school, and a right occasion to reform all 
universities, yes, also to eradicate all barbarism all the 
faster and to increase all scholarship in the most 
abundant way. In this you use your concern. Farewell.

| have the firm conviction that my name stinks with many, 
for good people have long been accusing me of this, that 
| condemn the rosaries, the crown prayers, 1) the little 
psalters, even other prayers, and even all good works. 
So it also happened to Paul from those who said that he 
said [Rom. 3:8.], "Let us do evil, that good may come of 
it." | have certainly followed Tauler's theology, and the 
booklet,2) which you recently gave to our Christian 
Goldschmied to print. | teach that men should not trust in 
anything else but in JESUS Christ alone, not in their 
prayers and merits or in their works, because it is not by 
our running but by GOD's mercy that we are saved [Rom. 
9:16.]. From these speeches those people sang the 
poison, which, as you see, is spread by them. But for the 
sake of good or bad talk | have not begun, nor will | desist 
from it. God will have mercy. The same people bring 
hatred on me because of the scholastic teachers, 
because | prefer the church teachers (ecclesiasticos)

judgment, not (as they tend to do) with closed eyes. This

"Examine everything and keep what is good." | do not 
reject all their things, but | do not approve of everything

grace, do not respect those larvae in the least. They are 
words, they will remain words. If Scotus, Gabriel and his 
kind were free to have other opinions than St. Thomas, 
again the Thomists are allowed to contradict the whole 
world, yes, among the scholastics there are almost as 
many sects as heads, rather as many as hairs on each

Brother Martin Eleutherius, Augustinian, ‘wishes’ his 
Johann Sylvius Heil. 

See, there you have my expert opinion on your 
doctrines, as you wanted, my dearest Sylvius. First of all, 
| like the fact that you subject everything to the judgment 
of the church, especially of your Ordinary 3) (as he is 
called). For even the truth must be spoken with fear in the 
Church of God. Secondly, | believe that everything is true, 
and | myself have read and taught almost [the same] for 
a long time, even though it is new and sharp, and 
therefore (as it is wont to happen) to the unlearned.

you may see whether you have also done enough for the 
friends, much more for the enemies. For | fear that it 
might seem to the friends, that is, to the scholars, as if 
you had consulted a kind of Midas 4); the unscholars or 
enemies (of this | am certain) will judge you as if one 
heretic had consulted another and, as they say, one ass 
itches another. For this Martin has a much worse name 
among these people than Sylvius, both because of these 
common things and because of his own, which | believe 
you know. But just as the kind Savior Christ bore us 
exceedingly wretched sinners, and bears us to this day, 
so it behooves us also to bear those people, however 
much they may be our adversaries. For we must not 
despair of them, even as we ought not to be 
presumptuous of ourselves, being among one another 
bone of the same bone, and flesh of the same flesh [Gen

To Johann Eck. 


Luther reproaches him for having attacked him so deceitfully 
with his obelisks. 


From a copy in the Nuremberg City Library, No. 406, p. 2, No. 
2, printed in Erl. Briefw., Vol. V, p. 1. 

Martin Luther to the highly learned theologian and 
philosopher Johann Eck, Pro-Chancellor of the 
University of Ingolstadt, Canonicus of the church 
at Eichstadt, a special one among his friends. 

Several obelisks have come to me in which you have 

tried to destroy my theses on indulgences, and this is a 
testimony to your faithful friendship, which you freely 
offered me, yes, of evangelical love, by which we are 
commanded to admonish the brother before we accuse 
him. How could I, a simple man, believe or suspect that 
you would act backwards against me, since you have 
been so flattering against the brother? And thou also hast 
fulfilled the scripture [Ps. 28:3.], "He that speaketh kindly 
to his neighbor, and hath evil in his heart." | know you did 
not want such a thing to happen to you from me, but you 
did it and were able; you may see what your conscience 
tells you. | am very surprised at the audacity with which 
you alone can presume to judge my opinions before you 
know and understand them. This presumption is certainly 
a very faithful witness that you alone seem to be a 
theologian, and so alone that not only your opinion is to 
be preferred to all, but also everything that you have 
condemned, although not understood, is to be 
condemned because it does not please the corner. | beg 
you, let us at least live and rule by God. But lest | deal 
much with thee, because thou art altogether mad against 
me, behold, | have sent the asterisks 1) against thine 
obelisks unto thee, that thou mayest see and know thine 
ignorance and iniquity, in which, of course, | have been 
so

| do not want to publish them, but address them to you 
privately, so that | do not want to repay you for the evil 
you have done to me. | have written them only for? , 
through whom | have received your obelisks, so that you 
receive the asterisks through him. Otherwise, if | had 
wanted to let them go out into the public, | would have 
written more carefully and appropriately or also in a firmer 
manner against you. If now still the confidence from your 
trivial things should stand firm with you, then do it and 
write; | will meet you with no less confidence. Then it may 
be that | will not spare you either, although, God knows, 
| would rather that you would get along again, and if you 
disliked something about me, would first act amicably 
with me, as you should have known was proper for a 
theologian. For what whore, who is a little angry, could 
not spew the same vituperations and disparagements 
that you have spewed against me? and still you do not 
regret this at all, that you also boast and seem to have 
done right. You have the choice; | will keep the love if you 
want. | will cheerfully accept your attack, because, as | 
see, you know nothing in theology except the trumpery of 
scholastic opinions. What you will accomplish against 
me, you will realize when you begin to prefer peace to 
war and love to raging. But the Lord give thee and me a 
good mind, and bid them both be well. Behold, | lay down 
my arms, even though | am wounded, not because | fear 
you, but because | fear God; according to this, the blame 
will not be on me if | am forced to defend myself publicly. 
But good words. Farewell. From Wittenberg, May 19,

Hail! | beg you, my dear Spalatin, not to be displeased 
that | write either very late or very seldom. | am not 
sufficient for half of my business, which, | do not know 
through what fruitfulness of time, is constantly increasing 
contrary to expectation. Petrus Mosellanus has been with 
us, ready to accept the condition and the office of 
professor of the Greek language, and has asked me to 
write this to you in his name. Since | did not know whether 
anything had been traded between you and him in the 
meantime, | promised to write, and behold, | write. It will 
be up to you to proceed in this matter, as God has given 
you the knowledge and the ability. 

Among my things from the chapter, this booklet also 
came with me, which you instructed me to hand over. 
Among so many thoughts | forgot to whom it should be 
handed over. | offered it to everyone | knew, but no one 
could be found. If | can still deliver it through the 
subordinate brothers of our order, let me know and it will 
be done. 

| sent you two books the other day, but incomplete, 
which discuss theology in un 


serer German language contain. 1) | send the remaining 
sheets (duerniones); if, in addition, something should 
still be missing, then write. For the whole is ten sheets 2) 
strong. Fare well and pray for me. My proofs 3) are under 
the press. 

Johann Tetzel has published against my German 
Sermon 4) likewise a German booklet, an excellent 
witness and herald of his ignorance, to which | will add 
light, 5) so that it may be known by all how it is 
constituted, not how he himself regard his booklet zero. 
Fare well again. All in our Wittenberg monastery, in the 
greatest haste, on the day after the Feast of Corpus

To Scheurl. 


Luther writes about his and Carlstadt's dispute with Eck, which 
could still be settled through Scheurl's mediation if Eck did not 
reply to the asterisks given only privately and did not answer 
Carlstadt too sharply. 


The original is in the Scheurl family archive at Nuremberg.

1) "A German Theologia." - A "Silen of Alcibiades," according 
to the adagia of Erasmus, is a thing that at first sight seems small 
and ridiculous, but on closer acquaintance is worthy of 
admiration. Artists used to have in their workshops larger 
containers, representing the figure of Silen, in which they kept the

Hail! What you ask for our Eck, my dearest Christoph, 
would not have been necessary in any way, since you are 
such a great friend to me, if the matter had still stood, and 
he himself had preceded you by his letters. For it has also 
increased my suspicion that Eck's heart is estranged 
from me, that he, after having given me such frightening 
names, 4) although this was written privately, has sent 
me nothing, neither a letter nor a word. But since our 
Carlstadt's "defense sentences" 5) (problemata) have 
already been published, admittedly without my will and 
knowledge, | know no good advice as to what both should 
do. | know that we love this man's intellectual gifts and 
admire his erudition; and | am aware and testify that what 
has happened was done with sadness rather than out of 
anger or spite. As for me, | have written this letter to him, 
which, as you see, is quite friendly and full of kind words 
against him. Not only for your sake, but also because of 
his free confession, | am quite conciliatory, because he 
writes that he, though not me, dislikes the fact that this 
incident has happened either through foreign malice or 
spite. Therefore, in this matter at least you have power 
over me, and he has it too. Only one thing will be 
incumbent on you, that you take care that he does not 
answer our Carlstadt too harshly, and that he considers 
that he was first to blame for the fact that this evil 
occurred among friends. For | believe that there is no 
need for him to answer me, since | have given my asterisk 
privately.

To the highly learned and finely educated Georg 
Spalatin, librarian of the Duke of Saxony, his 
faithful friend in Christ. 

JEsus. 

Hail! Before your letter came, my dear Spalatin, the 
Sermon on the Banishment 3) had already been 
published, but in such modesty, and supported with such 
firm proofs of truth, that | cherish the hope that it will not 
only not be disapproved of by the lovers of truth, but will 
be received with complete favor, even by those whom 
tyranny itself delights; so gloriously have | raised that holy 
power, yet without flattery, but not without necessity. For 
| have taught nothing in it that they themselves have not 
taught and do not teach. 

What you write and remember about our Philip 
Melanchthon, you shall not doubt that it has been done 
and shall be done. He gave a speech on the fourth day 
after he came, which was highly learned and completely 
without fault, with such great applause and admiration 
from everyone that you now no longer need to be 
concerned about the way in which you might recommend 
him to us. We turned our opinion and our sight away from 
his stature and his person very soon, and wish in the 
matter itself

to him happiness and admire him, and say thanks to the 
most noble prince and also to your service. But it is more 
important to see to it that you can best recommend him 
to our prince for his studies. | certainly do not desire any 
other teacher for Greek, as long as he remains healthy. 
There is only one thing | fear, that he, because he is so 
delicate, may not bear the way of life of our region well, 
then, because | hear that he has been hired for a too 
meager salary, so much so that the already boasting 
Leipzigers hope to take him away from us as soon as 
possible. For he was also coveted by them before he 
came to us. | have the suspicion, and many others with 
me, that Mr. Pfeffinger, as is his way, wanted to prove 
himself an all too faithful steward of the prince's purse in 
this matter as well. 

Therefore, my dear Spalatin, to speak freely, that is, 
with my best friend, see to it that you do not despise his 
person and his [youthful] age; he is a man worthy of all 
honor. For | would not want us and our university to be 
guilty of such tremendously rude behavior, from which 
our enviers could make a quite respectable fairy tale of 
us. 

| send my quite farcical and completely off-the-cuff 
written dalliances against Silvester, my quite woodsy 
(sylvestrem) and boorish sophist, which | poured out in 
two days. For he did not seem worthy to me that for his 
sake | should put the power of my mind and the effort of 
study into such trivial and (as mau says) bullaceous 
conclusions for nothing. 

Let my things be in your command, | thank God and 
you. Farewell and love me in Christ. August 31, 1518. 

Brother Martin Luther, Augustinian. 

D. Andreas Carlstadt is engaged in an external fight 
against Eck's defense, 1) and as far as | can grasp, Eck

Spalatin to Luther. 

This letter is the answer to No. 85 (Vol. XV, 430). About 
Cajetan's and others’ attitude toward Luther; he urges confidence, 
thanks for the "explanations" sent, whose dissemination is taken 
care of; expresses disapproval of the dissemination of the theses 


of the excommunication (foisted on Luther) and writes about 
Staupitz's concerns about Luther.

Burkhardt, Briefwechsel, p. 11 and in Erlanger Briefwechsel, vol. 
I, p. 231. 


To his venerable father in Christ, Martin 
Eleutherius, Augustinian, Doctor of Theology. 

Good health! | have no doubt, my dearest Doctor 
Martin, that soon after the departure of Magister 
Johann, your colleague from Nuremberg, you 
received the letter of our most noble Prince and thus 
also mine. Cardinal Cajetan, if he does not deceive 
the prince as well as me, is not so hostile to you that 
he should make such a great offence against you to 
the emperor and the great ones of the Holy Roman 
Empire. For since he recently spoke confidentially and 
much with our most noble prince, who had gone to 
him, this gave me great hope that he would be much 
more lenient and tolerant in your cause than | feared. 
For although | believe that many, | do not know what, 
have done against you, | do not know, but rather hope 
that God will graciously assist you and destroy all the 
counsel of the adversaries, however hostile and 
various and dangerous things they may have in mind 
against you. | also have no doubt that, God willing, like 
the prince, you will also escape this danger from the 
dignitatis. In my opinion, you have offered yourself 
lawfully enough to have your cause recognized in an 
unsuspicious place before unsuspicious judges. A 
heretic 





calls you only the Tetzelian rabble (Tetzeliastri), that 
is, the people who do not understand anything about 
all fine arts and sciences. The most noble prince 
refuses a rescript, as you have requested it, for such 
a reason that even you could not blame. For | believe 
that there will be no lack of a way to protect your name 
and your welfare. You, therefore, be confident in the 
trust of God and your clear conscience. However 
much the shortness of time may press, however other 
things may hinder, it may be that he will overcome all 
difficulties. Therefore, have a theological courage. 

For the "explanation" of your theses on 
indulgences, | thank you eternally. For it pleases me 
extraordinarily such a learned gift. Therefore, | will 
see to it that several copies given to very learned men 
make your opinion on this matter better known than 
that you could justly be brought into such great spite. 
Five days ago | sent a copy received from a friend as 
a gift to the Cardinal of Sion, Mr. Matthew 1) of the 
title St. Pudentiana, who is staying with the Swiss and 
is a very learned and righteous man. He is, as | hear 
from those who returned from the man within a few 
days, extraordinarily devoted to you. Christoph 
Langenmantel is very devoted to you, but so are 
many others of whom you might not suspect this. | 
cannot say, however, how much evil, how much 
spitefulness the sentences from the ban 2) seem to 
have brought you. | cannot be surprised enough that 
they were sent here from there, and all the more so 
because (I write what | have seen) an exceedingly 
bitter mockery against Roman avarice had been 
attached to them. For that which has been sent hither 
has been delivered into the hands of both apostolic 
legates. | fear that it has been sent to Rome and has 
done you tremendous harm. But God will help His 
own in due time. However, be careful not to irritate 
those wasps even more, either in preaching or in 
disputing or in public teaching. For | know that if you 
only avoid the danger 3) that the future way to

Response to No. 75 a. Luther judges in his own cause. Luther 
accuses him of immodest behavior, while the most important 
men give him the testimony of modesty. He would answer 
Luther's verdict in the next letter, since the messenger was 
hurrying. He does not completely reject Luther's answer to the 
Dialogus of Silvester Prierias, but he does not approve of it in its 
entirety. Carlstadt is preparing a new war against him, but he is 
as little afraid of him as an elephant is of a mouse. He wishes 
that the quarrel in writings between them would come to an end, 
so that the study of theology would be strengthened and flourish.

His Georg Spalatin zu Altenburg 2c, who was 

extremely favorable to him. 

M. Spalatin "zu Handen". 
JEsus. 

Hail! We have tried, my dear Spalatin, that the 
doctor's banquet of the father Johann Frosch could be 
brought about at some citizen's house, but we fear that 
we are trying in vain. Therefore, so that we do not let the 
man, who is most worthy of honor, go without honor, we 
have turned our eyes to our monastery, and will rather 
provide the meal with our burden, of course with the 
reservation of the prince's promise. For we are in truth 
poor, and very many, so that we cannot do it for nothing. 
Now we ask you to see to it that the prince provides us 
with game.

To Melanchthon. 


Luther, as dean of the theological faculty, had conferred his 
doctorate on Joh. Frosch, and Melanchthon had stayed away 
from the doctor's banquet held at noon. Now, on the same day, 
Luther invited him to dinner and asked him to bring D. Veit 
(Warbeck) and Joh. Schwertfeger with him.

To Philipp Melanchthon, "Schwarzerd", the Greek, 
Latin, Hebrew, German, but never barbarian. 

Hail! Today you have (which the Muse and Apollo 
may forgive you for) despised both me and the new 
(novellum, as it is called) Doctor. Now, although this 
matter was not entirely mine, | have forgiven you; but 
because you do not appear at this hour before Doctor 
Andreas Carlstadt and Licentiate Amsdorf, but 
especially before the Rector, not even the Greek 
(Graecitas) will be able to excuse you, let alone Martin, 
that "little brother", as Cajetan says. 2) The new doctor 
believes that he (as he likes to joke) is held in extremely 
low esteem as a barbarian full of Greeks. You see what 
you do, for | myself have promised that you will certainly 
come at this hour. You will do me a service if you come; 
but | would very much like you to bring D. Veit 3) and 
Johann Schwertfeger with you. For that evening | will be 
the host, to whom they are very well known, indeed, very 
dear friends. They shall come with you according to your 
judgment and advice, but primarily at my command (if 
otherwise that little brother still counts for something). 
Farewell. 

The little brother Martin Eleutherios.

Gunkel is now leaving, falls, and the text 


1) The words Signa supersunt cognoscenda are somewhat

2) In the Interpretation of the Ten Commandments, St. Louis

Aristotle's books, namely the Thomists, the Scotists, the 
Albertists, and the Modernists. The two 





We are of the opinion that the Scotist philosophy and 
logic together with the text of physics and logic are 
sufficient until the chair of the Scotist sect, which teaches 
Magister Premsel of Torgau, falls, so that this Magister 
lectures on Ovid's Metamorphoses instead, since he is 
well versed in the fine sciences. For we think that the 
Scotistic philosophy and logic together with the text of 
physics and logic are sufficient until the chair of the 
Scotistic sect, which is just as useless and unfortunate 
for good minds, falls away, if in some way the names of 
the divisions are finally completely destroyed, and pure 
philosophy and theology and all subjects are drawn from 
their sources. We want to hear your advice in this matter.

To Joh. Reuchlin. 


Luther wished Reuchlin luck for the happy consequences of 
his dispute, through which many in Germany had been 
awakened to the study of the Holy Scriptures. Now he followed 
him in the dispute, although with less strength. At Melanchthon's 
instigation, he wrote to him. 


The first ones had remained in the study plan at Wittenberg. Now, 
in this letter, Luther advises to abandon also the Thomistic way 
of explanation and to keep only temporarily the Scotistic one 
besides the simple textual explanation of Aristotle, the textualis 
lectio.

Martin Luther, Augustinian, to Johann Reuchlin of 
Pforzheim. 

The Lord be with you, exceedingly brave man! | wish 
you happiness for the mercy of God that is with you, most 
learned and worthy man, through which you have finally 
prevailed and stopped the mouths of lies [Ps. 63,12]. You 
have indeed been an instrument of divine counsel, which, 
as it was unknown to you, was highly desirable to all 
those who are zealous for pure theology; so much more 
was done by God than seemed to be done by you. | was 
one of those who wished to be with you, but no 
opportunity presented itself; yet with my prayers and 
wishes | have always been present with you. But what 
was denied to the companion at that time has now been 
given to the successor in the most abundant way. The 
teeth of this Behemoth 1) are attacking me (Job 40, 10), 
if they could in any way wipe out the disgrace they have 
suffered from you. | also meet them, though with far less 
gifts and powers of learning than you met them with and 
threw them down, but with no less confidence of heart. 
They refuse to fight with me, they refuse to answer, but 
set out against me with pure force and violence. But 
Christ lives, and | can lose nothing because | have 
nothing. Not a few of the horns of these bulls have been 
broken through your steadfastness. For it was through 
you that the Lord worked, so that the tyrant, the sophists, 
finally learned to resist the right studies of theology more 
cautiously and more gently, and Germany began to 
breathe again through the teaching of the Scriptures, 
which, alas, had not only been suppressed but also 
eradicated for so many hundred years. This beginning of 
the very beautiful studies did not have to be 


1) Compare Vol. XV, 612 f., § 2. Similarly Vol. VIII, 1729. 





But just as God destroyed the greatest mountain of all, 
Christ, to the dust of death, but from this dust so many 
great mountains grew up, so you too would have borne 
little fruit if you had not been killed and turned to dust, 
from which so many great ones in the sacred sciences 
are now rising. And the prayer of the groaning church has 
been heard [Ps. 12:2]: "Help, O Lord, the saints have 
decreased, and the faithful are few among the children 
of men," for the worst among the children of men have 
been exalted to the majesty of God. 

But see, am | not impertinent that | speak to you so 
confidentially, without an honorable preface? But this is 
due to my extremely servile disposition towards you, 
which is also very close to you, both through the 
remembrance of you and through the reading and 
contemplation of your books. In addition to this, what has 
also moved me to finally write that our Philipp 
Melanchthon, 2) an admirable person, indeed, who has 
almost nothing that does not go beyond a human being, 
and yet is very familiar and close friends with me, has 
demanded this letter to you par excellence, and vouches 
that you will certainly not take it badly, but will also 
recognize with gratitude whatever | blather to you. | 
wanted you to attribute to him what you want to attribute 
to him; | only wanted to testify to my completely sincere 
feelings toward you through this letter. Farewell and be 
happy in the Lord, who in truth is a teacher to be revered.

3) Reuchlin, who was always far from the cause of the 
Reformation, even, several years later, harshly opposed to it, did 
not answer this letter. Only once did he greet Luther through 
Melanchthon in a letter of Sept. 12, 1519. (Karl Krafft and

Scheurl to Luther. 

On the news of Luther's appeal, Scheurl gives some 
examples of earlier appeals; expresses his joy that Luther has 
resumed his preaching activities; reports the arrival of Pfeffinger 
and Miltitz and the latter's attitude against Luther. He exhorts him 
to act thoughtfully and not to trust in the King of France; 
exhortation to peace, which Miltitz will offer him. Request to write 
something to Hieronymus Ebner and to send his Sermon vom 
Leiden Christi.

The other day, after | had received the very sad 
news that you had bid farewell to the people,” 
appealed to a concilium, fled helplessly, abandoned 
by all protection: then | suffered with many good 
people, but also remembered that in Antonius, 3) Title 
22, Cap. 1, § 3, Barbadorius, for his Florentines, 
turned his face towards the image of God 4), had 
appealed to God from the present Pope Gregory XI. 
to God, approximately with these words: God, we, the 
envoys of the Florentine people, appeal to you and 
your equity from this unreasonable judgment of your 
governor: You, who cannot be deceived nor 
influenced by anger, who do not love the servitude of 
nations, but freedom, and hate tyrants and lusts, will 
come to the aid of the Florentine people, who defend 
their freedom, and will graciously assist them as a 
protector. And what can make even more impression: 
in Baptista Fulgosus, 5) "Of memorable speeches 
and deeds", book 1, under the title: of miraculous 
things, in the chapter of the knight of Jeru

Florence, born 1389, Dominican, 1445 Archbishop of Florence, 
died 1459, canonized by Hadrian VI in 1523. The passage cited

salemer (Hiero[solymitani]) order, | read that a 
Neapolitan man of war, a Templar, in Bordeaux 
(Burdegala), which is a city of the Basques, being 
condemned to death by fire, and seeing in a window 
Clement V and Philip the Fair, exclaimed: You most 
cruel tyrant Clement, since there is no one left to me 
among mortals to whom | can appeal for the severe 
death penalty with which you unlawfully impose on 
me, | appeal to the righteous judge Christ who 
redeemed us, before whose judgment seat | call you, 
together with King Philip, wno has advised such a 
great evil that you both appear before him within a 
year, where | will present my case, and justice will be 
administered without any ill will, - and in the appointed 
time, Clement died suddenly, and not long after, 
Philip was also carried off by death. This is what those 
writings report. 

But after a few days we heard with immense 
pleasure (for we love you dearly and want you to be 
well) that you were well, and heard from letters that 
you were preaching again, and, as is your way, had 
preached extremely salutary also about the 
conception [of Mary] 6) and on December 15 we 
unanimously read your Acta, also the word 7) "I 
appeal" in large letters. On December 15, we 
unanimously read your Acta, also the 7) word "I 
appeal" in large letters, but | am unwilling about the 
slowness of mine in sending them. 

Meanwhile, Carl von Miltitz, apostolic chamber 
clerk, came to us with Pfeffinger. We got to know the 
man five years ago, so we have spent these two days 
and a large part of the night with him very 
confidentially. All conversation concerned Luthern 
alone; hear in a few words the short epitome of it. Car! 
is a Meissen knight, a German. He is a human being; 
he thinks that nothing that concerns human beings is 
foreign to him. He will not dispute except about one 
thing: that one must not contradict the pope, but 
rather obey him. He does not disapprove of the 
disputations, the theses, the explanations as 
vehemently as the German sermon on indulgences, 
8) by which he is not to be contradicted. 


6) December 8. The sermon has not been preserved. 

7) cancellatum. To this the Erl. Briefw. has the note: 
"cancellare, actually to cross out a writing with grids (X) to make 
it invalid". It seems to us that the word (cancellatus here cannot 
have the meaning "crossed out", "crossed out", but rather: 
highlighted.

that he write for you to the pope; in which he praises 
you and the large number of students; that it would be 
shameful for him to send you away unheard, since 
you are willing to be instructed and corrected. 
Pfeffinger says that the pope must be obeyed; you 
would easily have a bishopric or some other dignity if 
you only recanted. The pope could not suffer this; 
during the whole pontificate there had been nothing 
more worrying; he had promised his own the 
cardinalate for Luther if they could bring about the 
recantation. But | have not seen this letter, but | have 
contradicted that you would recant for the sake of the 
pope; but you would do it voluntarily, but in vain, if you 
were only taught otherwise. What Tetzel preached we 
often repeat; about the souls granted to the nuns and 
the men of war Carl is indignant beyond measure; he 
would write it to the pope, if only it could be proven by 
witnesses. He is troubled, displeased and bothered 
by many disputations, since he praises you to the 
pope. 

It only remains, excellent man, that you diligently 
take care of your cause by foreseeing the future, as it 
were, from a vantage point, that you do not act 
recklessly, that you do not act in a careless manner, 
that you take care, that you are content, that you do 
not despise, that you do not reject the peace that is 
offered to your house. Consider: Where would you be 
able to go if the prince left you? Many do not trust the 
French very much; Carl considers it certain that King 
Francis would not stand by you for three days 7) if the 
pope contradicts. The Emperor also agrees with him, 
who, | am told, advises you to obey the Pope. 
Pfeffinger says that he has gone many thousand 
steps for your sake; he will return in a month at the 
latest; the legate will not return for your sake alone, 
he follows the emperor; he spends 1200 gold florins a 
month. However great the power of truth and the 
Gospel, | doubt whether any prince will finally fight 
with his danger. How much to trust in this, your royal 
seer [Ps. 118, 9.] gives information about. Have the 
Emperor and the Frenchman given the Cardinals, 
who have fallen away [from the Pope], the occasion 
to assemble a Concilium 8) and given orders for it? Is 
it then

that, although he had received great money, 
remained on the side of Julius? And 1) the Cardinal 
Sanctae Crucis,2) when he returned and wanted to 
recant, testified to this: even if he believed that he had 
not erred, he still acknowledged an error if an upset 
had resulted from it. 

If thou desirest to be heard, that is fair; but with 
those ignorant of the law, in the written reports (in 
notoriis) it is not necessary to proceed according to 
order, where the perverse order is the highest order, 
and the "to make known and to know" (declarare 
notorium) is with the mighty, because the law is in 
arms. Your conscience moves you to obey the 
Scriptures more than the pope; but to many it seems 
that it is given to the pope to interpret the Scriptures, 
and everything must be done prudently and wisely, 
consideration must be given to order, for nothing is 
more detestable to our governor than worry. If the 
princes refuse thee, what wilt thou do? You have 
shown enough what you are capable of: Rome fears 
you! A wise man has always kept himself in such a 
way that he sent himself into the time; the rest can be 
saved for a more occasional time. | like this word: It is 
more praiseworthy to yield with gain than to conquer 
with harm. What | have written with a sincere heart, 
venerable father, | ask a friend to interpret in the best 
possible way, for it is in no way intended as if | wanted 
you to do something unworthy, shameful, disgraceful, 
but only to seek with the utmost diligence some 
honorable means by which the pope and you would 
be satisfied. And | do not doubt that this can be found, 
in view of the obedience to which one must return, that 
aggravation is to be avoided, that the pope who 
declares such is to be honored, and that effort is to be 
expended so that the minds of the prince, the 
courtiers, the people [are] not alienated from you. 
There are people who consider the appeal all too 
hopeful. One must strive that Carl does not leave 
indignantly, but rather that your and the university's 
cause becomes one, that they recommend you again, 
that the abuses of the opponents and all that is yours 
be brought to the pope either through an orator or 
procurator.

so that the matter is discussed longer and kept in 
labeyance, whether it could perhaps be settled, so that 
tthe lightning is not necessary, which he [Miltitz] has in 
lhis hands; as | said, he is a man, he is good and kind, 
lhe does not praise the legate; he wanted him to be 
there, believing that an undeserving Carl would be 
sent to you by God: In such a kind way he praises 
everything; he will not dispute; the man must be dealt 
with kindly, lovingly, politely, if his heart can be 
softened, and | have no doubt that this will happen.

Luther answered the question whether the Turkish war could 
be approved and advised according to the Holy Scriptures. First, 
one should overcome the internal enemies; the Pope was doing 
worse than the Turk. He wants to wait in Wittenberg for the 
outbreak of the Roman fury. From the sermon held in Weimar.

that if we are to fight with the Turks, we must first begin 
with ourselves. We wage carnal wars abroad in vain as

testament no war has been waged with human forces 
other than always with an unhappy and ignominious 
outcome; but if something has gone out well, then it has 
been waged from heaven, as | could prove exceedingly 
abundantly. But since the Roman court nowadays| 
surpasses the tyranny of all the Turks (with such great 
abominations it fights against Christ and His Church), and 
the clergy is sunk in the depths of covetousness, ambition| 
and indulgence, and the appearance of the Church 
everywhere is very miserable, there is no hope for a good 
war or a happy victory. God (as far as | can see) is fighting

To Martin Luther. 

My Carl [Miltitz] assures us that he has of course 
demanded the rose for three years, and that this task 
has been assigned to him. He fei not legate, but 
commissarius alone, but with the order that he use 
the council of the legate. Forty brevia had been left 
[by him] at Augsburg for the rulers of Germany, by 
which they are ordered to render assistance against 
the unarmed; the helpful hosts will be blessed, those 
who resist will be eternally damned. He will not make 
use of these; he will do, as far as it can be done, what 
pleases the prince; he comes as a private citizen, not 
as a judge, but as a friend, but to inquire what is the 
prince's decision, what is Martin's opinion, what is the 
favor of all. 1) He would report all this to the legate 
and to the pope; in ten years the apostolic see has 
not had a more difficult, frightening, anxious and 
humiliating 2) matter. You must do something, at 
least make up for the very vehement letter to the 
Cardinal; he is unwilling about the Vicarius [Staupitz] 
and your departure [from Augsburg, without 
welcoming him, as if you had him for your best. | have 
excused this; he admits that you should not have 
returned if you had not gone into yourself. The 
Cardinal says that he is not staying in Germany for 
the sake of this matter, but is waiting for the assembly 
of princes which will take place at Worms or Frankfort 
about Easter, and the Emperor has made plans to 
come to Augsburg for Epiphany. In my opinion, the 
legate from Linz will also follow. He says he must 
meet with you; he will confer with you in the friendliest 
manner, there is nothing to fear. Since this is certain, 
we do not yet have to fear the thunderbolts, and not 
everything must be easily believed, but [everything] 
must be handled with the greatest humility and the 
greatest effort must be made that you may be heard, 
so that the matter may be settled,

Luther argues that the foundations in his "Explanations" are not 
valid because he relies solely on Tauler, whom the church does 
not know. Luther takes Tauler's side.

Martin Luther to Johann Eck, one of the first 
philosophers and theologians, the famous man, 
pro-chancellor at Ingolstadt, his lord and superior. 

We have tried many times, my dear Eck, that the 

Leipzig gentlemen would like to grant us the permission 
you write about, but they simply refuse, claiming that it 
is not in their power to perform this service in this matter, 
but that this decision is up to the ordinaries. For this is 
how the Dean of Theology answered my letter; hence it 
is that this disputation (as | fear) will be thwarted if you 
do not have another council. By the way, | expect, and 
indeed very eagerly, what you promise [darzuthun] that 
you have found that in my "explanations" 1) even my 
fundamentals are useless. For you wonder that | have 
preferred the one Tauler, you say: "| do not know whom," 
your Thomas, to Bonaventure, to Alexander 2) 2c. and it 
seems ridiculous to you that | demand that this one of 
you be accepted with me, who, moreover, is unknown to 
the church, while | have rejected so many men. But | beg 
you to read him through before you declare him a 
dreamer, unless you too, through the lukewarm habit of 
doing trivial things, are one of those exceedingly clever 
people who call the pope, the bishops, or the teachers 
of the universities the church, and immediately declare 
everything that may be unknown to them to be unknown 
to the church, although | wonder who may have told you 
that he is unknown to the church. But you are the church, 
everything is known to you! Do you not see, 3) how you

considered, and make them

you are in the habit of condemning? Therefore, if you 
want to admonish me, | ask you to apply sharpness of 
judgment and carefully consider every detail. Consider 
that | knew very well that he was unknown to your 
church, since | said that | did not have him in the public 
schools, nor was he written in Latin; then, in what way |

attacking my unlearnedness, as if | had not read or 
known yours either, but you at least knew yours; of mine, 
however, you say: "I do not know whom. But now, that

know. And so that | do not demand what is beyond your 
powers, | do not wish that you, with the help of all and 
every one of your scholastics, write even one sermon 
equal to that man's; | do not demand that, because | am 
sure that this is impossible for you. But for this alone | 
urge you: use all the powers of your intellect with all the 
fullness of your scholastic erudition, and all that you are 
and have, whether you can understand one or the other 
of his sermons correctly. Then we will believe you that 
that man is a dreamer, but you alone are a waking man, 
or at least one who slumbers with open eyes. | am writing 
this, my dear Eck, because | do not want you to take the 
trouble to admonish me in vain, but to put into action 
something that cannot be overturned by me and that 
drives me to change my mind, that is, something worthy 
of your talent and effort, so that we both do not spend 
our time in a bad way. Farewell, my dear Eck. At Leipzig,

Hail! | came to Wittenberg and found a man who 
wants to teach Hebrew (he is almost still a youth) and is 
quite learned. 1) For at the hour when | arrived, he 
immediately delivered a Latin speech decorated with 
Hebrew, and he pleased [us], and therefore it seemed 
good to us that if that old man 2) ever brings about his 
resignation, this one will be accepted in his place, and his 
resignation will be permitted. Perhaps the Lord also takes 
care of our university and deliberates without us. 
Therefore, answer as soon as possible what seems good 
to the most noble prince.

ignorance, and add your advice whether | should strike 
again; also the dialogue of Lucian, which was sent to you 
from Leipzig. But listen! | have forgotten the copy of the 
letter, both in Latin and in German, which the most noble 
prince wrote to the legate 3) and left it at Altenburg in your

letter is with many, but with the highest praise and

To the highly experienced and extremely learned man 
in law, Doctor Christoph Scheurl, the Nuremberg 
commonwealth's advocate, his very faithful [friend] 
in the Lord. 

JEsus. 

Hail! | have stolen this hour from myself and my 
business; | am writing at last, lest, with so many letters 
from you, | should appear ungrateful, and as if | never 
wished to answer. Now | thank you most sincerely for the 
advice of your real and true friendship and for your 
concern for me. But | would gladly have an end to this 
unrest if the same could be seen in the adversaries. For 
they have set themselves (as | see) to bring the matter 
to an end not with kindness but only with violence and 
noise. Hence it is that from day to day they stir up greater 
things and toil in vain. For by force they will never be 
subdued, that | know. 


5) There, the Elector and Duke John of Saxony held a 
meeting with others, as D. Schurf, Spalatin 2c., in order to give 
your legate a final answer regarding the requested help for the 
Turks. See No. 117 (St. Louis edition, vol. XV, appendix, No. 24).

enough. Through kindness, | know, it would have an end. 
To Silvester's antics, if they originate otherwise from 
Silvester, it does not seem at all worthwhile for us to 
respond, for they are childish and effeminate and nothing 
other than lamentations of his pain. With Carl [Miltitz] | 
have agreed most amicably, 1) first, that this matter be 
completely covered with silence on both sides; second, 
that by order of the pope some bishop of Germany report 
the erroneous articles to me, which | should revoke. But 
if God does not intervene, nothing will happen, especially 
if they should begin to press me with that new decree 2) 
which | have not yet seen; but | have heard that it speaks 
of a complete authority [of the Pope], without any 
confirmation of Scripture or the Canons, which | certainly 
cannot grant to anyone, not even to the oldest decree. 
Who knows what God has set before Himself to bring 
forth from these monstrosities. |, as much as there is in 
me, am not afraid of it, nor do | wish the matter to be 
dragged out. There are still many things that can set the 
Roman swamp in motion, which | would like to suppress, 
if they allow it. But if God does not want them to allow it, 
then let the will of the Lord be done. To Ebner's patrons 
| wish from the bottom of my heart good health and say 
thanks for the casel received. | hope that your 
Nuremberg [young people] will correspond to your 
wishes in the best possible way, since they are both 
under the best teachers and attend the most select 
lectures. Fare well in the Lord, and cast your care also 
for me upon the Lord, that you may not be too anxious 
for me. January 13, 1519.

Hail! | send what you have wanted, yes, what | have 
been able to, about the employment of the confession. 2) 
You see what | have accomplished. | also enclose a small 
disputation about which we are still in dispute. But how 
completely true | consider it, you will see in all that, where 
it is brought with the ecclesiastical affairs by the frogs of 
Egypt, yes rather by the Egyptians. 

But that you desire a form to celebrate the (so-called) 
memorial in the mass:

| beg you, do not let these trifles trouble you. Pray for 
those whom the Lord will give you, and keep your mind 
free in these matters. This matter is not so great that it 
would be necessary to bind the spirit of freedom anew by 
decrees and statutes; the mass of the already abundant, 
all too much, mighty statutes is sufficient. 

| have not yet seen any of Carl's [von Miltitz's] last 
letters; perhaps you were wrongly informed that he had 
written two letters to me. Our Philip teaches the Hebrew 
sciences, as with greater fidelity, so also with greater fruit 
than that John, 3) the apostate, that is, the runaway. 
Man's faithfulness and diligence are so great that he 
hardly allows himself any time. 

| would finally like to know what | can write back from 
you for Herr Sigismund von Chlumma. 

And finally, to remember us, although | do this only 
reluctantly, Christoph Bressen, our interest man in 
Motterwitz, who lives under the Leisniger Amt, has long 
since failed to pay us the interest owed. For the past year 
he has not yet fully paid, and now in the new year the 
later interest is piling up on top of the earlier. | have 
spared the man so that | would not bring him into disfavor 
with the most illustrious prince, but the extraordinary 
danger in which both the matter and we stand forces me 
to trouble the prince again. Therefore | ask you to do 
something for us in this matter. The sum of the interest 
owed to us, both taken together, amounts to 120 florins, 
and we are poor, as you know, and, what is worse, we 
have many debts. Help us, therefore, but in such a way 
that the prince's mind, as much as it is possible, is not 
upset against the man. | know that the debt will be 
attributed to us, which we have sold, but we again 
attribute it to God, since he has taught us to care little for 
temporal things and to act in good faith. According to the 
flesh we have been foolish, but perhaps God has 
revealed His wisdom in this way.

himself against me and my writings: he names one as his 
opponent, with whom he wants to argue, but he attacks 
another, who has to deal with this matter. | dislike the so 
cowardly hypocrisy of this man, that is why | have

Luther says that it is now proven by public evidence that Eck's 
friendship was a pretense. He points out Eck's ambiguous 
behavior, that the latter, while pretending to want to dispute with 
Carlstadt about penance, is rather raging against Luther about 
indulgences. He asks him to determine the date of the 
disputation.

Martin Luther, Augustinian at Wittenberg, wishes the

Chancellor of the University of Ingolstadt, his 
superior in Christ, 

Hail and that he finally ceases to seduce the Christian 
people! | am sorry, dear Eck, that finally, through such 
obvious evidence, your friendship towards me is found to 
be a hypocritical one. You boast that you seek the glory 
of God, the truth, the salvation of souls, the growth of 
faith, and you teach about indulgences, the abatement of 
the truth, and the redemption of the faith. 





of faith, salvation and the glory of God. Your head is so 
nailed up and your brain so clouded that, as the apostle 
says [1 Tim. 1:7], you neither understand what you say 
nor what you say, and (that | may use your logic) you do 
not even know how to pronounce the predicate of the 
subject. Either hatred against me or the desire for fame 
has pushed you into this blindness. Therefore, you must 
ascribe the fact that you are now called a loutish man 
and a sophist in the whole world to your intemperate 
behavior, not to me, who was so concerned about you 
that | first suppressed my asterisms for your sake and 
made an effort to reconcile [you] with Carlstadt. You, as 
a fighter for the [indulgence] graces, pay for all this quite 
nicely, and since you want to dispute with Carlstadt 
about penance, you rage against me about indulgences, 
that is, about the remission of penance, and take things 
completely opposite to the matter. You may think what 
kind of man might do such things! By the way, | want you 
to fix the day for the disputation, or indicate it, if you want 
me to fix it. Everything else at the disputation. Farewell.

To the noble, highborn prince and lord, Lord George, 
Duke of Saxony, Landgrave of Thuringia, 
Margrave of Meissen 2c., my gracious lord and 
patron. 

JEsus. 

My submissive prayers and humble wishes are 
always before Eurn F. G.. Sublime, highborn prince, 
gracious lord! The worthy Doctor Johannes Eckius writes 
how he is planning to hold a disputation at Leipzig in E. 
F. G. University. F. G. University against the worthy 
Doctor Andream Carlstadt and graciously grant it. 

But because Doctor Johannes Eckius calls out to 
dispute against Doctor Carlstaden, and yet the same 
article, little challenged, falls into my position with all 
seriousness, it will behoove me to receive the unarmed 
giant and to represent my position or to let myself be 
taught the better. Therefore, my humble prayer to E. F. 
G. is that E. F. G. will graciously grant such a disputation 
for the sake of truth. For the worthy gentlemen of the 
university have written to me, as they promised Doctor 
Joh. Eckio, which | had heard from him earlier. But that 
they credit me with having let my disputation go out 
before | asked E. F. G. for it, happened out of confidence, 
E. F. G., and hoped that E. F. G. would not deny it to me, 
especially if they had already promised Doctor Eckio, as 
he boasts. Please, E. F. G. will graciously forgive and 
pardon me for this. God will mercifully save and keep E. 
F. G., amen. Given at Wittenberg, on the 19th day of 
Februarii 1519.

Doctor Christoph Scheurl of Nuremberg, his very

JEsus. 

Hail! | accuse myself sufficiently, best Doctor, that |, 
so often greeted by you, nevertheless write to you only 
rarely, but again | excuse myself with the fact that | am 
prevented by so many, almost monsters of business. 
The very learned dialogue between Julius and Peter 1) 
was exceedingly pleasant to me. It contains indeed much 
fruit, if it is read with seriousness. | am sorry that it is not 
known in Rome; | would almost like to wish for its 
publication, since it does not reveal the abominations of 
the Roman court at first, but confirms those that have 
been known everywhere for a long time, unfortunately, 
so that even through such antics the Roman great ones 
would be reminded of their tyranny and exceedingly 
ungodly sacrilege, which they see being practiced 
throughout the world. 

Our corner, which has hitherto hidden its nonsense 
against me quite nicely, has finally revealed it. See what 
it means for 


1) Luther (St. Louis edition, vol. |, 1618, § 5) considers 
Erasmus to be the author, as does Mathesius (St. Louis edition,

the authorship from himself. Bindseil, Colloquia, tom. II, p. 115,

is a human being. But God, who is in the midst of the 
gods, knows what he wants to bring out of this heavy 
trade (tragoedia). In this matter we will not be of service 
to each other in anything, neither Eck to himself, nor | to

carried out here. | have often said that | have been 
playing so far, now we will finally get serious against the 
Roman pope and the Roman arrogance.

also recommend him to the senators, whether their 
lordships might deign to invest him with any office. We

but chastise us in mercy, amen. Greet all of our people.

To Wilibald Pirkheimer in Nuremberg. 


Luther recommends Ulrich Pinder to him; comments on Eck, 
likewise on the Basel printing of his writings, in which Prierias is 
mocked. 


From the original first printed by Theod. Frid. Freytag, virorum 
doctorum epistolae selectae etc.. Lips. 1831, p. 18; in De Wette- 
Seidemann,vol. VI, p. 12 and in Erl. Briefw., Vol. |, p. 435. 


To the in every way highly respected man, Mr. 
Wilibald Pirkheimer, 1) Patrician, Nuremberg 
Councilor, Doctor, his highly revered patron. 

JEsus. 
Hail! | have sent my trifles to you, highly learned man. 
2) Now, while 


1) Wilibald Pirkheimer, from an old Nuremberg Patrician 
family, born in Eichstedt on Dec. 5, 1470, was a city councilor 
from 1504 to 1522 and frequently represented Nuremberg at the 
Imperial Diet. His house was the center of Nuremberg scholars. 
Initially enthusiastic about the Reformation, he later withdrew 
from it more and more for selfish reasons. He died as a private 
citizen on Dec. 22, 1530. 

2) Freytag (in Dorpat) assumes the "instruction on several 
articles, which are imposed and attributed to him by his patrons", 
St. Louis edition, Vol. XV, 699. 





| have answered too slowly before, | will write first. My 
love and intimate acquaintance with Ulrich Pinder, a 
righteous, honorable and also learned man, has driven 
me to recommend him diligently to you, worthy Lord, 
since he needs an office and your kindness. If he 
deserves to be given an income or a small priesthood in 
your excellent senate, | ask and beg for it, if you are able 
to do something; but you are able to do a lot. But | ask 
first for me, that after your kindness you bear this my 
impetuous behavior with equanimity; then for him, 
because man is worthy of the favor and service of a good 
man. 

By the way, | received the tendril 3) of my exceedingly 
lovely corner with great thanks. | send again what | 
opposed to him. As you can see, the matter is directed 
against the holy canons, that is, against the unholy 
corruptions of holy scripture, which | have long desired, 
but have not dared to advance of my own free will. The 
Lord draws me, and | do not follow unwillingly. If the 
Roman court has suffered over the dying indulgence, 
what will it do when (God willing) the decrees give up 
their ghost? Not that | will raise a cry of victory before 
victory, trusting in my powers, but that | will place my 
confidence in the mercy of God, who is angry against 
human statutes. | will maintain and confess the authority 
and majesty of the pope, but | will not suffer the 
corruptions of the holy scriptures. 

| believe that you have seen my trifles printed at 
Basel, which are decorated with such great wit and 
learned noses for New Year's Eve that they are 
beginning to please me, too. So much indeed have those 
very good alchemists made gold out of copper. These 
jokes will increase the torment of the Roman flatterers. 
They call the Silvester exceedingly wittily the cook

To the most illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Mr. 
Fridrichen, Duke of Saxony 2c, our most gracious 
lord. 

Most Serene, Highborn Elector! Your Lord is 
preceded by our prayers to God with submissive and 
obedient service. Most gracious Lord! After we have so 
manifoldly found out and daily experienced E. C. G.'s 
great favor and inclination towards this laudable E. C. G. 
University, and having always shown a kind patron and 
father, we are comfortingly moved and caused with all 
confidence to give E. C. G. what we want. C. G. what 
may be of more use, praise and honor to the named E. 
C. G. University, hoping to show E. C. G. a submissive 
favor, obedient service. There is a Thomistic lecture, 
namely in Physica, which itzo Magister Johannes 
Gunckel reads, which we consider good to do away with 
completely as an unnecessary one, so that the same 
Magister Johannes Gunckel reads textum Aristotelis for 
the completed lecture, at her pay, as our Rector Magister 
Bartholomaus Bernhardt read it until now. And that the 
pay of the completed lection would be given to Magister 
Philippo

for the sake of his faithful, surpassing diligence. For 
although he did not seek this and he is highly famed in 
E. C. G.'s favor and grace, it should nevertheless 
behoove us to apply and present such his diligence 
gratefully to E. C. G., so that he may honor us beyond 
measure and praise the university far and wide. Above 
this is another Lection Thomistica in Logica, which is 
read by Magister Jacobus PremBel for 20 Flor. Pay. It 
would be our wish that such wages and hours would be 
fruitfully spent and that the same lecture would be 
transformed into Ovidium Metamorphoseon libr. 2), 
so that there would be enough of the Scotistic and textual 
Logica and Physica, and the youth would not be 
overloaded with so many of the same lecture and 
prevented from improving, especially since there are so 
few auditors and students. We present all of this only in 
E. C. G.'s concern and pleasure, since we also find some 
of the university not entirely inclined to it. It is also 
considered good by many that we have an honest printer 
here in Wittenberg, for this should not be of little benefit 
to the university and to E. C. G.. C. G. honor. The text of 
Aristotle and other lectures could be promoted with it, 
which otherwise, without books, might not be so 
comprehensible and useful. God wants E. churf. G. to 
live long and save blessedly, Amen.

George au Doctorem Martinum Lutther. 

Dear scholar, dear, devout one! We have received 
your letter regarding the disputation that Doctor Egkio 
and Karlstadt are to hold at our university in Leypzigk, 
together with your apology, all the contents of which 
we have read out, and after the aforementioned 
Doctor Egkke indicated to us by letter that he had 
come to an agreement with Doctor Karlstat regarding 
such a disputation and requested that it be held in 
Leypzigk, we have not wished to refuse him such a 
request. If you do not agree to dispute with each other 
and make further requests to us, we will then listen to 
you as much as is appropriate and due to us, with our 
wise gracious reply, and let you take the matter 
before us. We do not wish to hold this against you in 
response to your letter. Given at Dresten on the 
Friday of Adriani Martyris [March 4], Anno etc. xix.

To Spalatin. 

Luther asks that Melanchthon be relieved of certain lectures 
that were unnecessary anyway. He apologizes for not being able 
to work on the Lord's Prayer in Latin because of his busy 
schedule. He is busy editing the Epistle to the Galatians and is 
studying the papal decrees because of the upcoming 
disputation. Finally, all kinds of news.

Erl. Briefw., vol. |, p. 448. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 624. 

To the worthy man, Christ's priest, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 
ducal Saxon secretary, his [friend] in the Lord. 
JEsus. 

Hail! It will go beyond the strength of our Philip, my 
dear Spalatin, to occupy himself with so many lessons, 
since he is already more than overburdened. For even if 
you think that one day should be read after the other, 
nevertheless the mind must be occupied with so many 
worries. Moreover, Aristotle's physics is a completely 
useless subject for any age; the whole book is a kind of 
argument about a trivial matter and about a merely 
assumed material. The rhetorical exercise is of no use, 
unless you want to see an example of rhetorical 
shouting, as if someone wanted to exercise his head and 
art over the dung or another trivial matter. The wrath of 
God has willed that the human race should be occupied 
for so many centuries with these antics, and quite 
misunderstood ones at that. | know the book inside and 
out, since | have already interpreted it twice privately to 
my brothers, leaving aside the glosses. Yes, we think 
that it should be read only for the sake that Ulan would 
finally (and soon) stop reading it, since it would be far 
more useful to read some speech exercise of Beroaldus 
2) himself; 


1) The people who are in favor of reading nihili with the 
editions, against nihil of the original and of the manuscript. 

2) Philippus Beroaldus the Elder, born in Bologna in 1453, 
died there in 1505, taught eloquence in Parma, Milan and Paris. 


156 


In it, there is no science of natural things at all. His 
metaphysics and his book "Of the Soul" are of the same 
ilk. It is therefore unreasonable that such a head [as 
Melanchthon] should occupy himself with such dung of 
trivial things; it is better to read it misunderstood (only to 
have gone through it) than understood. 

| send the letter of Eck, 1) the boastful and already 
certain of triumph in the Olympic Games. Johann 
Frobenius sent us my small writings, printed by him, with 
a letter; if you want to see them, | will send them. 

| cannot do the Lord's Prayer 2) in Latin because | am 
busy with so much work. Every day in the evening | recite 
the commandments and the Lord's Prayer to the children 
and the simple, then | preach; now | also address Paul to 
the Galatians (for printing,®) besides the prescribed 
prayers 4) and lections. | certainly do not have time 
enough, let alone superfluous. | have a sermon in mind 
"on the contemplation of the passion of Christ", 5) but | do 
not know if | will have so much leisure left to write it down; 
however, | will make an effort. 

| also go through the decrees of the popes for my 
disputation, and (I say it into your ear) | do not know 
whether the pope is not the antichrist or his apostle, so 
miserably (that is the truth) Christ is corrupted by him and 
crucified in decrees. It torments me extraordinarily that 
the people of Christ are so deceived by the pretense of 
the laws and the name of Christ. | want to share with you 
my remarks about the decrees, so that you may also see 
what it means to give laws by setting aside the Scriptures, 
for the purpose of usurping the reign of power, to say 
nothing of other works that are quite similar to those of 
the Antichrist.

To the beloved son of Martin Luther, of the Order

Leo Pabst X. 

Beloved son, greetings and apostolic blessings! It 
has pleased us most highly to hear from the letters of 
the beloved son Carl Miltitz, our Nuncio, who is 
seconded to the beloved son, the noble man 
Frederick, Duke of Saxony, that what has been less 
properly written or orally said by you, was not written 
or said with the intention and intent that you should 
offend us or the apostolic see and the holy Roman 
church in anything, but that you, irritated by a certain 
monk who was sent by our beloved son Albrecht, 
Cardinal - priest of the title of St. Chrysogoni, for the 
proclamation of certain indulgences, to answer the 
same, 1) and you, by pursuing him too vehemently, 
had gone further than you would have wished, had 
transgressed the bounds of respectability and truth, 
and, having considered this carefully, had regretted 
and lamented with exceedingly bitter pain what had 
happened 2) and you were ready to recant everything 
also by writings, and to denounce your error to the 
princes and others to whom your writings have 
reached, that you would refrain from the same things 
in the future, and that you would also have recanted 
everything before that legate of ours, if you had not 
feared?) that this legate would be too favorable to the 
said monk, who, as you claim, was the cause of your 
error, against you and would want to proceed very 
harshly against you. Considering then that the spirit is 
willing, but the flesh is weak, and that in the heat of 
anger many things are brought forward which must 
thereafter be set right on better reflection, we give 
thanks to the Almighty God, who has condescended 
to enlighten your heart and also to take care that the 
faithful of Christ, in these things which concern the 
salvation of souls, trusting in 


1) It seems to us that instead of respondens it must be read: 
responderes, otherwise ut would float in the air.

Your reputation and doctrine could be drawn into 
such grave and pernicious errors: and therefore we, 
who represent him on earth, who does not want the 
death of the sinner, but that he should convert and 
live, admit your excuses in a fatherly spirit, and after 
the benevolence which we bestow on all men 
learned in any science, and especially in the holy 
Scriptures, we desire to see and hear you 
personally, so that you may safely and freely make 
the recantation before us, Christ's governors, which 
you have shied away from making before our 
legate. Therefore, after receiving this letter 4) you 
may set out on your journey and come to us without 
delay. We hope, however, that with all hatred aside 
and with a reconciled mind, not even in some 
passion, but only filled with the Holy Spirit and 
fortified by love, you will so consider the praise of 
Almighty God that we may rejoice that you have 
been an obedient son, but you may rejoice that you 
have found in us a godly and gracious father. Given

caused by exaggerated reports that Miltitz, full of good hopes, 
had sent to Rome in January. But as things were quite different 
at the time of the arrival of this letter than he had thought, he 
withheld it (Késtlin, Martin Luther, Vol. |, p. 146 f.).

your advice. By the way, | have decided to despise these

to establish a printing workshop for us, if our most noble 
prince will deign to give his consent to it, as we have also 
previously indicated to his Serene Highness. Now we ask 
you for your service, that you give your advice and help 
to the common cause; to us it is an adornment, especially 
for our university, then we believe that it is also a benefit 
for the audience, especially because Philip is there, who 
wants to spread the Greek writings faithfully and in large 
quantities. 

Incidentally, we are now dealing with the theological 
lectures that are to be given, and see nothing else yet 
than that they alone (as before) are to understand the 
texts of the individual, 1) because we do not have the 
confidence that any candidate of theology 2) will soon be 
able so much that he can interpret either the Bible or a 
church father; then, in the course of time, it will not seem 
inconsistent that this should happen, when, after 
theology has taken root and the books have been 
multiplied, the matter can be more happily promoted. 

For our Schart 3)about the preparation for dying, 
Staupitzen's German booklet "von der Nachfolge des 
Sterbens Christi" would not be useless, in which he 
(according to his gift) has also treated the matter better

Most Serene Prince, Most Gracious Lord! We are 
forced by necessity to build a room, we have humbly 
asked the lords of the council of Wittenberg to grant us 
the right to build the moat from the moors, but our request 
is not answered. Therefore, we ask that the F. F. G. 
graciously grant us this emergency building favor and 
foliage, waiting that the F. F. G. graciously answer, we 
deserve against God. 

| also ask that E. F. G. buy me this Leipzig fair, which 
is a white and black cap. E. F. G. owes me the black cap, 
but | humbly request the white one. For two or three years 
ago E. F. G. promised me one, which has not yet been 
given to me, although Pfeffinger talked to me willingly, 
and yet perhaps for business reasons, or, as one blames 
him, money is slowly running out, moved, that | had to 
procure another one from necessity, and thus satisfied, 
until here E. F. G. promise spared. On this need | now 
still humbly ask, if the Psalter 5) deserves a black cap, E. 
F. G. will also let the apostle earn a white cap, and also 
ask, not to be left by the Pfeffinger but 2c.

169 





Friends steal time. 1) If friends are thieves of time, what 
are strangers and unknown people or those less close to 
you? But in this you will need the highest prudence, so 
that you do not, by avoiding living with people too much, 
fall into the company of evil spirits; again, if you get 
involved with them too much, you will be trampled by 
sows. Therefore, if God calls you (if it should be 
necessary to serve, to counsel, to talk with your 
neighbor, either because of his salvation or some other 
need, and you have been required to do so), then no law 
or rule of any kind that you have made must hold you 
back, for every law must give way to love, even that of 
praying and saying mass; but if you are not called, do not 
get involved with anyone, lest you begin to want to win 
the world and suffer harm to your soul [Matth. 16, 26]. 


Cap. 4. on prayer. 


Remember that you are celebrating as a priest, that 
is, a acommon and public servant; and therefore you 
must pray not so much for yourself as for all. Therefore, 
you must pray fervently not so much for yourself as for 
all people2) , especially and above all for the superiors 
of the Church, namely the bishops and rulers, because 
their salvation is the salvation of us all. 


Cap. 5: On the celebration of mass. 


You will not always be able to say mass, but in order 
to become able, you must sometimes do it, even if you 
are not able. You will do this if you remember that you 
have to sacrifice not for yourself, but for the sake of 
others who are in sin, for countless needs of Christians. 
Therefore, what you would not do for yourself, you must 
do for others; and only do not begin to have the 
confidence at times that you have appeared to be skilled. 


Cap. 6: The whole of life. 


As Tobias [Cap. 4:20.] taught his son that he should 
ask of the LORD that he should 


1) Compare St. Louis edition, vol. VIII, 1874. 
2) Here we have assumed omnibus after weather instead of: 
ovibus. 


Despair of yourself, and pray that he will guide your steps 
according to his word, because, as Jeremiah says, "I 
know," he says, "that man's doings are not in his power, 
and it is not in anyone's power how he walks or how he 
directs his course. Above all, act with the utmost 
gentleness toward sinners. For this is necessary for a 
priest, that he despise no one, but consider his sins and 
misery as yours, as you see that Christ did to us. Fare 
well in the Lord, and if you ask for more, | will gladly be 
at your service if | can.

do so by Doctor Eck, but | ask for God's sake that E. F.

Hail! | like the letter of Erasmus 2) quite 
extraordinarily, also ours, only one thing | would like, 
namely that my name is not only not mentioned in it, but 
also not sung about, especially by such a great man. | 
know myself very well, at least in this piece. 

By the way, before you leave, | ask you to let us know 
what the attitude of the most noble prince is regarding the 
Hebrew professor. Johann Cellarius von Kunstadt, who 
taught Hebrew at Heidelberg, was with us and will return 
soon; he testified by the publication of a grammatical 
booklet (which | believe you have seen) that he 
understands something in this matter; he promised us 
everything: what he could, he would faithfully teach (he is 
now in Leipzig and is waiting for our letters), when he has 
received the news that he is to be provided with a decent 
salary by our most noble prince. 3) Therefore, answer 
very soon, and at the same time send back the letter of 
Duke George. 

A large number of students 4) come here, and indeed 
excellent ones; yes, the well-known Nuremberg licentiate 
has come, a man of advanced age, preacher of the 
hospital and of Sanct Sebaldus, 5) and our city cannot 
hold almost all of them for lack of housing. Other things 
at another time. Farewell. On Sunday Cantate [May 22]

Worthy, dear devotee! We have read all the 
contents of your letter, which you sent to us again for 
the sake of the conceded disputation, and know of no 
disfavor that we should have borne or apprehended 
toward you. It is true that all sorts of things have 
happened to us, of which we would not have been 
unwilling to speak to you, but we want to leave such 
things until you come to us. So we are not a little 
surprised, since you have previously let us hear that 
itis not good to discuss these matters, and the doctors 
of the Faculty of Holy Scripture at Leipzig have also 
taught us that they refuse to allow such discussions, 
which is why you are now pressing so hard. And it is 
true that we have not been requested by Doctor 
Carlstadt either, but Doctor Eck has announced in his 
letter that he is uniting with him for the sake of the 
announced disputation. If this also happens here, so 
that you agree with each other and ascribe it to us, as 
you are now, as we understand from your letter, in 
work (inheritance), we want to show ourselves, 
according to our most recent letters, with an 
unquestionable answer against you and have it heard. 
We have not wished to respond to your letter in this 
way. Given at Dresden, Monday after Cantate [May

determination of the time of this postscript, we have followed the

is exceedingly dear in Christ.

Hail! As you promised me the other day, my dearest 
Georg, that you could and would arrange for letters to be 
sent somewhere, we now ask that you have these 
disputations of mine and Carlstadt's sent to Nuremberg 
or rather to Eck himself, depending on what seems best 
to you. | believe that everything else has reached you. | 
am surprised that D. Johann Aesticampianus 2) would 
rather read about Jerome's Jovinian than about Pliny. 
Whether you have done something in this, we also wish 
to know. The number of students is increasing greatly, 
like an overflowing water. Fare well in Christ. Tell Schart 
to bear for a little while the slowness of Martin, who is 
more than three times too busy. Wittenberg, 1519, on 
Tuesday after Cantate [May 24].

Luther apologizes for his silence and for a borrowed horse; he 
wants Glaser to visit him, talks about the Leipzig disputation, 
about his lectures on the Psalms, about the printing of his 
interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians. He talks about the 
hatred of his enemies and the burning of his portrait in Rome; 
about the condition of the monastery and the slander of a 
Franciscan monk.

Chancellor, Georgen von Widebach, Amtmann allhier 
zu Leipzig, Rentmeister, as princely decreed 
councillors, and Rector, Magistri and Doctores of this 
laudable university, between the worthy and highly 
respected, Mr. Johann Eckio and Mr. Andrea 
Karolostadt, doctors of the Holy Scriptures, the 
following agreement of disputation half decided and 
established: 

Namely, Doctor Eckius shall first oppose Doctoris 
Karlstadt's conclusiones, as much as he will ascribe 
them to him the evening before, and then Doctor 
Karlstadt shall respond; and the following day Doctor 
Karlstadt shall oppose Doctoris Eck's conclusiones, as 
he will also ascribe them to him the evening before, 
and then Doctor Eckius shall respond; and thus 
proceed further, one day ata time, until the end of the 
disputation. Such disputations, as argumenta and 
solutiones of both parts, shall be written out by four 
notaries and collated against each other at the end of 
the disputation, also a copy of the same shall be given 
to each part, but in such a way that such disputations 
and the same copy shall not be brought into print or 
otherwise publicized, unless both parts of a judge are 
united and the same ruling is publicized and opened 
thereon. 

Likewise, both parts are to unite before their 
departure from the judge, and the copies are to be 
deposited with the Rentmeister here. 

The following is agreed and approved between 
Doctor Johann Eckio and Doctor Martino Luther 
during the disputation: 

Doctor Johannes Eck and Doctor Martin Luther 
have half compromised and approved their 
disputation, as previously Doctor Eckius and Doctor 
Karlstadt have approved and compromised, and to 
perform the special injuries. However, Doctor 
Martinus reserved his appeal, which he had 
previously raised, as much as he had the right to do, 
and did not want to drop it, nor did he want the acts 
of this dispute to be sent to the papal court, for 
reasons that moved him to recognize it. If in this 
disputation there should be any mistake between the 
doctors concerned, they shall be instructed by the 
lords so ordered. Actum Monday Udalrici [July 4]. 
Anno ut supra. 

When it was previously indicated that the doctores 
concerned should unite for the sake of their 
disputation, they did so in the following manner, 
namely: Doctor Johannes Eck and Doctor Martinus 
Luther were admitted to the two universities of Paris 
and Erfurt, but Doctor Eckius and Doctor Karlstadt 
were admitted to the University of Erfurt. 





and whether more faculties than the Doctores 
Theologiae and Canonum should recognize such their 
contribution, shall be placed in my gracious Lord, 
Duke Georgen of Saxony 2c.,'s favor, and his F. G. 
may send such Acta to them; and have further 
extracted that for such recognition the fathers of the 
two orders Augustinensium and Praedicatorum at 
Erfurt shall not be used. In witness whereof we the 
said three Doctors have signed ourselves with our 
own hands at the bottom of this writing. Done at 
Leipzig (Leyptzk), Thursday after Margarethae 
virginis [July 14] Anno 2c. 1519. 

I, Johann von Eck, Doctor 2c., confess with this 
handwriting of my own that | have consented to the 
above articles as they are recorded here, that | have 
also accepted them, and that | will live and follow 
them faithfully as is proper and right. Actum at 
Leipzig, July 14, 1519. 

I, Endres Bodenstein, Doctor 2c., confess with this 
handwriting that I, as reported above, granted and 
vowed to keep and live duly also in the future. Dat.

And |, Doctor Martinus Luther, also confess with 
this my handwriting like the previous doctors. Dat. uts.

Notes. 1) 


The reasons why Luther insisted that all faculties of the 
universities to be elected should decide on the Leipzig 
disputation. 


From the handwritten transcript in the Dresden Main State 
Archives in J. K. Seidemann's Thomas Munzer, p. 161; in De 
Wette-Seidemaun, vol. VI, p. 18 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 
56, second naked entry, p. V. 


The reason why | have mentioned the entire universities 
and not only the Faculty of Theology. 


First, that by divine grace the young people are more 
skilled than the old. The first is that by divine grace, 
through the multiplication of many good books, the 
young people are more skilled than the old, having 
walked in their books alone. 


1) Caesar Pflug sent this note to Duke George on July 15, 
together with a counter-note from Eck, from which he gave this 
decision on July 16: "We cannot judge that those who do not 
understand this matter should decide on the disputation that has 
taken place, but that this should be done more wisely and more 
cheaply by those who have the authority and power to do so, and 
who also have a thorough and good understanding. (Seidemann, 
Leipz. Disp., p. 150.) 


178 


Secondly, that this matter, newly thought of, is 
contrary to those who have been theologians so far. 

Third, that the times are such that, according to divine 
order, everything that shines and appears is suspect in 
all classes. Third, that the times are such that, according 
to the divine order, everything that shines and appears is 
suspect in all classes, and almost come to the point that 
those are not theologians who think they are theologians, 
and the scholars are the perverse, the clergy secular, 
and the like. 

Fourth, that Doctor Eck in his disputation has taken all 
pains to make me and my matter hateful and to denigrate 
me, but to denigrate himself and his matter to the 
greatest extent, which, as it is read, does him no little 
harm and is put off to me by the old theologians in 
particular, because the matter was considered to be 
against them. D. Martin Luther.

To his extremely dear Georg Spalatin, Christ's servant 

and priest, princely librarian and secretary, in 
Christ. 


JEsus. 

Hail! | hope, my dear Spalatin, that everything | have 
written to you has reached you or will reach you, for it has 
been handed over to the messenger. With regard to the 
arrangement of the contemplation of the Passion of 
Christ, nothing is more troublesome to me than that | see 
that these ceremonies tend to make people wonderfully 
hard, arid, and completely unfit for all things and for all 
power of a spiritual disposition. For trusting that they have 
murmured many words and passed the hours, they go 
safely, seldom shattered, still more seldom ardent, least 
of all in self-knowledge. And that | tell you my heart's 
opinion, | like the pay of this endowment and the purpose 
of this pay more than the endowment itself, because 
those who want to lie down on the holy scriptures should 
rightly be helped by everyone, since there is only one 
thing by which the church is either elevated or depressed, 
namely either the knowledge or the ignorance of the holy 
scriptures. Therefore, if it pleases you (as you write) that 
it be done weekly on a few days, and even on these not 
the whole day, but at some hours by day and by night, it 
pleases mix also, only that as few days and hours as 
possible be taken. For nothing is so much to be feared in 
the setting up of ceremonies as that (as the apostle [1 
Thess. 5:19.) reminds us) the spirit may be subdued, and 
it will be better that, after hours, they should be performed. 


no. 202 to 205. 183 
The people who have passed in between do little in a 
single hour than if they complete everything one after the 
other without interruption; for in the former case they will 
be discontented, in the latter they will be lively, as much 
as the devil allows. 

But as for the psalms, which ones they may take? 
perhaps those that most concern the person of the Lord 
in suffering, which must be chosen and divided up among 
the days and hours with the responsories, versicles and 
collects, as is the custom. And | do not know whether it 
would not be most beautiful that the hour of each 
suffering be added with the expressed nature of the 
suffering of that hour, as the chant contains: Paztris 
sapientia, veritas divina, Christus homo, etc., 1) 
wherewith the psalms should be concluded. The other 
you have seen or will see in other letters. 

| have heard that Carlstadt has written something 
exceedingly harsh to you; you see that you spare the 
man, for he is challenged because of the water bladder 
of the Eckish boast and some others. Fare well in Christ.

This bearer of the letters asks that | write for him to

said to have once been a baker; so conscientious is the 
nobility of the craftsmen! But so that | do not fall heavily, | 
ask you to do this verbally (if you want) in my name.

To Martin Seligmann. 


In response to the question of how a Christian, especially a 
pastor, should behave in the face of the plague and other 
plagues, Luther replied that a weak person may flee, but a 
clergyman must remain with his congregation. 


Printed in Aurifaber, vol. I, p. 213d; in Léscher, vol. Ill, p. 987;

German in Walch, vol. XXI, 642. 

To the priest and servant of Christ, Martin Seligmann, 
vicar in the valley of Mansfeld, his exceedingly 
dear [friend] in Christ. 

JEsus. 

Hail! | have received your letter with your questions, 
my dear man, and | very much approve of what you firmly 
assert regarding brotherly love and bearing the scourge 
of God. And yet God would have all Christians be foun 
to be such people as you describe them here. But what 
shall we do, if not all are able to do everythin 
the weak be carried and taken up, 
14, 1] teaches? And what you say, "One bears another 


burdens," seems to me to apply more to those against praiseworthy, 


whom you have used it. Those are rather the weak who 
flee death, 2) than those who expect it. Moreover, famine 
and the sword are undoubtedly plagues of God as wel 
as the plague, as is abundantly clear from the prophet. 
But we read in the first book of Moses [Cap. 12,10.] that 
Abraham fled from the plague, likewise in the book of 
Ruth [Cap. 1, 1]. Furthermore, how often did not the 
saints flee from the sword? In Jeremiah [Cap. 35, 6-11], 
the children of Jonadab went to the city at the time of war, 
yet they had taken a vow not to live in any house. 
Therefore, in my opinion, although all are to be 
exhorted to suffer the hand of the Lord valiantly, yet they

Did Christ carry the apostles when they were afraid to die 
and woke him up from sleep? [And he scolded Peter 
wea 14,31] because he was afraid to walk on the sea, 
ut still he carried his weakness. Therefore, if the 
estilence and any scourge of God must necessarily be 
ines it also follows that it is not permitted to call upon 
the saints of God for bodily healings. Then we would also 
ike to take away all physicians with all pharmacies, since 
it would not be permitted to seek an escape from the 
scourge of God or a remedy through them, since 
weakness would also be a scourge of God. For these 
things the divine goodness has provided for those who 
are weak in faith. 
By the way, those who are perfect and desire death 
pf their own free will have no need of these things. For 
even the church, when it prays against the plague, against 
ightning and thunderstorms, does not pray for the weak 





d and tries to avert the scourges of wrath. She would pray 


badly, because it would not be allowed to flee, to drive 


g? Must not away, and (if it is possible) to avoid the scourge of God. 
as Rom. 15 [v. 1 and The brotherly love, however, which perseveres in these 
Is evils with others, is found in the perfect; it is very 


and if it should be of use to the neighbor, it 
is also commanded. But then it is necessary if no one else 
could assist those dying of the plague who would like to 


serve the sick. For | am firmly convinced that a priest who 


is commanded to care for the sick may not flee or order a 
believer to take his place. 

About this, read the extremely instructive letter of 
Augustine to Honoratus, which is in his legend, described 
by Possidonius 4), in the eleventh part, at the end. For he 
teaches that a shepherd must be with the sheep of Christ, 
and lay down his life for them [John 10:12], since he 
represents the state of the perfect. Therefore we, who are

Crotus Rubianus 3) to Luther. 


Crotus assures Luther of his old friendship from Erfurt. He had 
first heard of the dispute that had broken out through Jakob 
Fuchs, and then received some of Luther's writings against Rome 
from his brother Andreas, but he had had to keep them secret. 
About the impression that the Leipzig disputation had made in 
Italy; about the Roman conditions and the presumed success of 
Luther's action against the Roman tyranny. He encouraged him, 
whom God, like Paul, had cast down to earth by a lightning strike 
and chosen, to continue the struggle, but not by way of 
disputation, which was of no use.

To the venerable Father Martin Luther, 
Augustinian, the learned and holy professor of 
theology, his oldest friend. 

Hail! Two things, venerable Martin, who is 
exceedingly dear to me, keep my love for you firm, 
namely that in our youthful age at Erfurt we were in 
the closest acquaintance with the fine arts at the same 
time; this time forges the closest bonds of friendship 
among like-minded people; secondly, that we have 
you as such an excellent defender of right godliness, 
which you protect with the shield of Scripture as much 
as others, in the hope of gain, strive to overthrow it. 
Hence it is that |, who am so far away from you, talk 
to you more often, shake your hand more often, dream 
of you more often than those whom you have near 
you; for this | call our Hess 4) as a witness, who 
administers the office of an envoy for both of us with 
you; for it moves me, my dear Martin, it moves me the 
quarrel which the wretched Dominicans arouse in you, 
who are in contact with many at 


3) His real name was Johann Jager and he was from the 
village Dornheim near Arnstadt. He changed the name "Jager" 
into Crotus, the name of the constellation of Sagittarius. Rubianus 
or Rubeanus he called himself after his birthplace, translating 
"thorn" by rubus (blackberry). He was born around 1480; as we 
see here, he soon fell in with the Reformation without being 
inwardly attached to it. Later, he took a firm stand against it when 
he entered the service of Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz in 1531. 
In a letter to Justus Menius of October 18, 1531, Luther calls him 
"an Epicurean who venomously persecutes us," and elsewhere: 
"Doctor Toad, plate licker of Mainz." 

4) Johann HeB from Nuremberg, later in Breslau, was the 
bearer of this letter. Luther received it in December.

whose conspiracy is against your head. And if you had 
not been given by God to this corrupt time, so that the 
right of God would have protected you as a master of the 
Christian doctrine, we would have already given you the 
funeral oration. So great is the rage of those people who 
would rather have their doctrine approved than that of 
Christ; so great is Roman avarice that it invents a 
thousand kinds of poison and treachery if anything 
serves to profit. When | was still in Germany, 1) nothing 
had been heard of your Punic war; in the year after, 
Jakob Fuchs, 2) who is also your special patron, when 
he visited the thresholds of Peter out of a vow, first 
brought the news that the arms had been taken. But the 
first thing that came into our hands from this scholarly 
dispute was the dialogue of Silvester, the astute 
theologian, who uses mockery? and witticisms in a 
successful way, so that he wants to make your iron nose 
turn away, and truth flows into him, who defends the 
papal party, all by itself. 4) After this astute writing, 
Andreas Fuchs, 5) dean of Bamberg, sent us your 
explanations of the disputed theses, then the Augsburg 
treaty; 6) all of this has been eagerly read by us and, 
read by the hands of many learned people, we have also 
sent it to Rome, so that we suppress the false rumor 
spread about you by evil people. This had to be done 
secretly, so that it would come into the hands of the 
readers without the name of the sender, lest we bring 
disaster upon our heads through the ignorance in those 
places where the rule of the priests is terrible. For those 
are considered heretics who approve of your books in 
Rome, and those who bring them there bring them there 
with danger to their heads. For

family, was a canon in Bamberg and Wurzburg. His relatives

on behalf of Canonici Apel and Fischer, who were imprisoned 
because of their marriage, under the title: "Von dem

Rome is intolerant, hopeful, and always afraid that truth 
might take something away from the things it holds 
through tyranny. After your disputation became known, 
those who wanted to judge most wisely among the 
theologians said that they were with you in heart, but with 
their mouths they were of a different opinion, not only 
because they feared the pope's power, but also because 
if his reputation were diminished, the existence of the 
Christian community would be shaken. How righteous 
this opinion is, they may see for themselves; | hold here 
that the Christian religion needs no false pretenses, and 
that he who speaks otherwise than he believes in his 
heart is not Christ's disciple, whose teaching commanded 
[Matt. 5:37], "Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay." If 
the newer theologians, as well as the disputators, had 
stood as firmly in this opinion as they did on the 
Aristotelian decrees or those of the brazen sea, we would 
not have been forced to obey the will of the pope more 
than Christ's commandments, nor would you have been 
so weighed down in your argument by his reputation, nor 
could Rome have so changed the Catholic faith into 
another form, namely, into the form of him who, though 
he is a man, permits divine honors to be bestowed upon 
him by flatterers, with contempt for the form of him who, 
though he was God, uttered himself and assumed the 
form of a servant [Phil. 2, 6. f.]. It is a common speech in 
Rome, even of those who seem to be intelligent: this 
cannot be other than exceedingly Christian, what is good 
for the pope; yes, if you also oppose a hundred Pauls, 
yes, the whole Scripture; since he is the governor of 
Christ, who has the Holy Spirit for a leader, by whom he 
is governed. For there are some misunderstood 
passages of Scripture in common use, with which they 
immediately seek to shut the mouths of the gainsayers. 
What, therefore, will your disputation accomplish? What 
fruit can the holy Scriptures bring us after their reputation 
has been lost? Certainly none, unless princes and 
bishops consider it more sacred to protect God's words 
than to spend a great deal of gold for so many palliatives, 
indulgences, bulls, antics, good-for-nothing things, so 
that the holy fathers may feed their whores and 
scoundrels. Once, in the presence of a certain Magister 
noster, a wretched Dominican, | rebuked the excessive 
Roman licentiousness that oppressed the Christian 
people and stained their morals.

Divine will must not be inquired into. | answered him:} Your appeal to the judgment seat of a general council, 


"If one is allowed to defend the deeds of shame with 
divine providence, then one may cut them off much 
more sacredly by the power of the Scriptures, with the 
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God [Eph. 
6:17], since the will of God is not known from anything 
else than from the testimony of the Scriptures, which 
has come forth from the mouth of the Most High. - 
This | say, my dear Martin, so that you may realize 
how little this applies to Rome when you say [Ps. 119, 
129.]: "Your testimonies are wonderful, O Lord, 
therefore my soul holds them." For one has advanced 
so far in ungodliness that he who is called a good 
Christian or a good theologian is regarded as 
showered with the utmost contempt, but he who is 
greeted as a chamberlain or table companion of the 
pope is regarded as a lucky child, so that the pope 
occupies the first place in dignity, Christ the last. Here 


which is so completely fortified on every side with the 
protection of divine and human law, is very 
impressive, that it earns praise even from the 
opponents. But it is surprising how much gall it 
arouses in the Florentine party, which fears that after 
the right over the souls of the departed is gone, they 
will be deprived by a similar dispensation of the 
pallize, the reservations, the bulls, the prerogatives, 
the very wide jurisdiction, and the other things to 
which the name of ecclesiastical liberty has been 
attached, namely, the nets for taking the money of the 
poor. Germany will be blind as long as it remains in 
its error, and as long as the scholars do not cry out 
publicly, do not write against the harmful customs 
which Rome sends us, and remind the uneducated 
poor people of the Roman deceit, that we, who have 
hitherto been so often deprived under the pretext of 


nothing is invented: When the king of the sacrificial| godliness by taxes for the Pallias, for confirmations, 


monkeys (Rex sacrificulus) goes out, so many 
cardinals, so many protonotaries, so many bishops, 
so many legates, so many provosts, so many 
advocates pile up around him, as hungry birds gather 
around rotting corpses; Christ's supper 1) follows on 
some donkey in the last crowd, which the lewd women 
and the ravished boys form. | have recently been to 
Rome with our Hess; | have seen the old monuments, 
| have seen the harmful chair [Ps. 94, 20]; to have 
seen it is useful, to have seen it is annoying. There 
some (as they made themselves believe) astute 
people attacked me because of the indulgence and 
the power of the pope, as if | could or wanted to 
dispute about these things, especially at Rome. | 
protected myself by silence, only that | once jokingly 
answered a certain chatterer, who transferred the 
forgiveness of sins from the power of God into the 
hands of the pope, because Christ said to Peter 
[Matth. 16,19.]: "Everything you will solve on earth", 
that only the Lord leads into hell and out again [1 Sam. 
2, 6]. Therefore you are not the victor, Martin, 
although you, armed with the protection of Scripture, 
have attacked the throat of the enemy with the sword 
of the Holy Spirit: with the Roman See, not with 
Scripture, stands the verdict of victory, for the latter, 
as your Silvester testifies, takes its credit from the 
former. But against this difficulty you are preserved 
unchanged. 


for war against the Turk, have now received cardinals 
in the midst of Germany to our greater burden; for 
what this innovation of the Florentines would give 
birth to, the outcome will soon reveal. | often call you, 
Martin, the father of the fatherland, who would be 
worthy of a golden statue and annual festivals, since 
you first dared to free the people of the Lord from 
harmful opinions and to assert the right godliness. 
Continue as you have begun, leave the example 
behind you for the descendants, for you do not do this 
without God's intervention; divine providence has had 
its purpose here, since on your return from your 
parents a bolt of lightning from heaven, as it were, 
threw you down to earth as a second Paul before the 
city of Erfurt, and drove you into the Augustinian 
enclosure, out of our fellowship, through your [for us] 
exceedingly sorrowful departure. After this time, 
although our intercourse was rare, my heart always 
remained yours, as you could have perceived from

A knight who is held in great esteem by the emperor. 
You have been made tired so far and have suffered 
much in your body and in your good reputation, but 
difficult things will not be accomplished without great 
effort. When the end of the troubles will be there, the 
memory will be sweet to you, and you will say 

[Ps. 66:12: "I came in fire and water, but you 
carried me out and refreshed me. Then all Germany 
will turn its face to you, then it will hear the word of 
God from you with admiration. 1) But for the sake of 
your meekness, | beg you, henceforth, not to enter 
the battlefield of public disputation, especially against 
sacrilegious people; do you not know that the children 
say: "Against a talker, one must not fight with words? 
Disputation within your monastery with the pen, in all 
tranquility; the most accurate disputation is the one 
that is put on paper; the one that turns here and there 
with words lacks the right judgment and often 
distracts the disputant's mind from the truth, not to say 
that it is disgraceful for a theologian to get into a 
quarrel. As soon as the day of the dispute became 
known to us, we disliked the plan; for Bologna 2) 
knows Eck's way; Vienna also knows it well. But the 
matter went out for us, as Lang's and Melanchthon's 
letters testify. Farewell and keep me dear; | will not 
cease to love you. | will protect your honor here as far 
as it can be done with certainty. Forgive my hastily 
thrown down letter; | preferred to make many words 
with you and to write without care, rather than to 
carefully compose a short letter. | have hardly been 
able to look through it again. At Bologna, October 16,

Crotus Rubianus to Luther. 


Crotus reports that Eck in Rome, on his own testimony, is 
regarded as the victor in the Leipzig disputation; of a letter from 
Eck to Rome, in which he asks the pope to take serious action 
against Luther, Hitten and the humanistic studies; to force the 
universities of Paris and Erfurt to give their verdict on the Leipzig 
disputation; of the reward which Eck demands for his services, 
and of a new large book 3) of Prieria against Luther.

Monum. pietatis, tom. Il, p. 11; in Bécking, opp. Hutten. tom. |, p.

Hail! Eck is celebrated in Rome as the victor in the 
Leipzig disputation: so much is his own testimony 
valid where the people are drawn by hope to the side 
on which they wanted to see the victory bend. | have 
resisted an overhaste of the verdict, so that Rome 
would not suffer again what it suffered shortly before, 
when it attributed the imperial dignity to the 
Frenchman 4) for certain, while our princes chose the 
Lord Carl. But let Rome have its judgment, if only that 
is certain, that not everything is just which it decides 
by its judgment. But it is foolishness to decide on the 
victory and to doubt it at the same time. Eck 5) sent a 
letter to Rome, which, apart from the pope and two 
theologians, only very few have seen; a certain 
physician, our friend, listened in unnoticed when it 
was read very secretly, and what he was able to 
retain in his memory during the reading, he 
communicated to me in brotherly good faith; | 
communicate this to you, Martin, under the same seal 
of secrecy, that you do not make it known, so that the 
physician remains unharmed. The letter was written 
in many chapters, which indicated the order of the 
Leipzig disputation, then also the way in which the 
pope had to proceed. Bishops have been appointed 
for your condemnation, with a certain number of 
[people] who are necessary for the judgment; the way 
in which it has been held with them has been 
indicated.

imperial throne. Carl V was elected on June 28, 1519.

who have taught against the church, so that each one 
may serve as an example. You have been made 
hateful mainly for the sake of the Bohemian religion 
and because of your approval of the Hussite doctrine; 
the poets and those who have a passion for the fine 
sciences have been accused, but especially my 
Hitten, from whom some poems about the Florentine 
fraud 1) have been quoted; a complaint has been 
added about the danger threatening in the church 
through the Greek and Latin studies, which are 
increasing more and more from day to day; then the 
pope has been persistently admonished that he suffer 
no more delay in the great danger, and by threats 
force the school at Paris and ours at Erfurt to 
pronounce their judgment; 2) indeed, if he were to 
prolong the matter, he would soon lose Thuringia, 
Meissen, and the Mark, and soon after other regions 
whose peoples would want to enter heart and soul into 
your heretical opinion, as he calls it. The doctor has 
not kept other things, and | cannot tell you unknown 
things; you can take similar things from this and judge 
the matter for yourself; since it is not small, take it to 
heart, but keep quiet if you do not want to ruin me and 
the doctor. When | return to Germany next spring, | will 
give the middle finger to the false apostles, 3) who 
devour us and strike us in the face; here [in Italy] one 
must close one's eyes. Eck at first desired as a reward 
for his disputation the office of a heretic inquisitor in 
the precinct of three bishops; now he has changed his 
mind and is applying for a parish in Ingolstadt, but in 
the same letter he severely accuses the pope of not 
condemning the right of a certain person to this parish 
in his favor, since he suffers so much for the church. 
Greetings Carlstadt. In haste, at Bologna on the day

tata, etc., is the talk of the town. The letter of the same is dated: 
"Rome. 1519. decima. Junii." At the beginning of the 15th chapter, 
fol. 212, Prierias says that at the time he received "Luther's 
explanation of the thirteenth thesis on the power of the pope," the 
work had been completed (with the exception of the 15th and 16th 
chapters) and had already been given to the printers to work on. 
Luther's aforementioned writing may have been received around 
the end of August or the beginning of September 1519. See our 
detailed report on this work of Prierias in the St. Louis edition, Vol. 
XVIII, Introduction, p. 19b f.

sive palus == stake. 

6) The three preceding expressions: ecclesia essentialis, 
virtualis and repraesentativa are used by Silvester in the dialogue; 
the three following ones: accidentalis, nominalis and participalis 
are mockingly hung on him by Crotus.

on November 1, this letter is to be placed in October.

understand it correctly? But even Eck has been clearly 
refuted by the text itself, first by the adverb "until," which, 
according to the usage of Scripture, does not fix the time, 
as those think, as Matt. 1,“ 25.: "And knew her not until 
she bare her first son." See the Erasmus and Jerome. 
Secondly, because the words of Christ speak of such a 
one as is not willing to his adversary, that is, who has not 
obeyed the commandment of Christ, of whom also they 
themselves confess that he sins unto death. Therefore, 
that dungeon is hell, from which no one is released, 
while those alone send to purgatory those who have 
done everything and have been willing to their 
adversary. Therefore, this text is valid only against them, 
unless at the same time they say that the souls in 
purgatory 5) are separated in hatred and anger and 
discord with the adversary, which, | hope, not even their 
iron forehead can understand.

would like to dare. But Christ speaks of these, as evena 
child can understand. The passage of the apostle to the 
Corinthians [Cap. 3,13. ff.] was also forcibly snatched 
from the corner, even though he chatted that it was 
exceedingly clear for him. The words of Paul are clear, 
that the day of the Lord will prove the works of each one; 
this day (he says [v. 13. Vulg.] will be revealed in fire. 
Hence even a person without understanding sees that 
Paul's words speak of the Day of Judgment, when the 
world will perish by heat, and can only be drawn to 
Purgatory by force or by a figure (which proves nothing). 
The word of Christ in John [Cap. 15, 2] about the vine that 
is to be cleansed was drawn to purgatory by a certain 
Vincentius 1) as if there really was someone who had 
done violence to the Scriptures more often than this very 
Vincentius. If by the word "purify" the purgatory is 
understood everywhere, why”) is it written Luc. 2, 22 
[Vulg.]: "When the days of their 3) purification were 
fulfilled" ? And what should those rightly understand, to 
whom the words of Vincentius are articles of faith? There 
is still the very clear passage in the books of the 
Maccabees [2 Macc. 12,46.] left. But this book does not 
make articles of faith, nor is it held in high esteem by the 
Fathers; in particular, this second book has been rejected 
by St. Jerome in more than one place. In short, although 
| know that there is a purgatory among us, | do not know 
whether it is among all Christians. It is certain that no one 
is a heretic who does not believe that there is a purgatory, 
nor is it an article of faith, since the Greeks who do not 
believe it have never been considered heretics for that 
reason, except by the recent heretics (apud 
haereticantissimos haereticantes). And at the Basle 
Council they are to give an excellent account of their faith.

that she could not manage such a large sum a year from

Luther sends him a piece of a work as a sample, which 
Spalatin is to follow in continuing it. About the remarks about the 
Leipzig theologians made at a dinner party; about Einser's 
rebuttal, to which Luther only wants to respond when Eck's has 
also appeared.

Hail! | send you, my dear Spalatin, the work 3) One 
Sunday as a sample, since you, after your greater

passages in the remaining [pieces] from my collection.

3) This "work" is summarized by the Erl. Briefw. "as a sample 
of the church postilion the treatment of a Sunday"; De Wette says: 
"probably a sermon". Neither seems permissible to us according 
to what Luther further adds. It is perhaps to be referred to the 
"Tessaradekas," which was intended for the Elector and was then 
in Spalatin's hands.

Hail! First, how much to give to my judgment, you may 
see; it will go beyond the forces, if only one teacher of 
the school (paedagogio) is to be presented. Secondly, 
if Qnintilian and Aristotle "of the living beings" cannot be

the living beings in place; then Pliny will easily replace 
him. Quintilian, however, is the only one who can make

210 Letters from the year 1519. 





To the learned and extremely honest man, Mr. Georg 
Spalatin, Christ's servant, his dearest friend. 
JEsus. 

Hail! Dear God, as my corner is never anything other 
than acorner; so he also, the wretched man, crept around 
the matter to Leipzig, yet slippery, and was always afraid 
to come to the purpose. But God would that his little book, 
of which he boasts, would be out; may the Lord grant that 
| have lost my work for the last time on these trivial things; 
| hope so. 

However, | am surprised what is being done about the 
parish of Schmiedeberg before the most noble prince. 
Magister Herzberg has the votes of the university, and | 
do not like the fact that they are invalid. | do not want you 
to do anything in this matter that would deceive the one 
to whom the spirit has given it. 

If you know anything about the matter of the widow, 
which | have recently traded through you, | ask you to 
inform me. There is a danger that | will fall into the hatred 
of the canonists or become more involved in it. Already 
with four copies of wills (as they are called) they are 
attacking my patience quite severely by revealing that 
they prefer concern for temporal things, not to say 
avarice, to love, and not without annoyance, which (as 
you know) is not always to be suffered by me according 
to my duty. 

Now they have a deal with the castle piper Nicolaus 
in a similar case. There is talk and a common rumor that 
a certain person died of hunger, who gave them 
everything they had only to keep, to whom they gave 
nothing back. | do not believe it, but | am afraid that if it 
were investigated, not everything would be found to be to 
one's liking. | would rather have talked to you about this 
than written. | wanted to send the Tessaradekas to 
Leipzig, but | will see if | can be at your beck and call.

JEsus. 

My poor prayer and all good beforehand. Strict, 
honorable, dear Lord and friend! Your. | have diligently 
received and read through your letters and questions. | 
have committed myself to your strictness of all service. 
After | have found Your great faithfulness to Augsburg, | 
would like to answer this question correctly and clearly. 
But the gospel is in my way, since Christ gives a short 
judgment in all such matters and says: Whoever wants to 
quarrel with you and rightly take your coat, let him also 
take your skirt. As a theologian with a guilty conscience, 
it behooves me to give no other advice in this matter. 
Therefore, no one party among you will do enough for the 
Gospel, unless one lets the other follow what he wants. 
3) The bishop ordinarius is to take the coat from the 
bishop. The bishop ordinarius shall leave it, if the council 
desires it, and again; and does not help the bishop his 
spiritual right, nor the council his custom or habit, for the 
gospel is above all. It is true that the pope has decreed 
that the third part of such a sacrifice 4) is to be given to 
the ordinary; but whether he has the power to do so, | 
leave to him to decide. It almost looks like selfishness. 
But we are guilty of suffering violence, even injustice. 
Therefore, my advice and request would be that the 
Ordinary and the Council come to an amicable 
agreement, without all rightful severity or remedy; 
perhaps the Ordinary can be appealed to. If not, they may 
rightly not keep it before the Roman See. As a 
theologian, who is not entitled to quarrel and rights, but 
to peace and patience, you will accept this good opinion 
of mine with goodwill and kindness. For | am always 
ready to serve E. Gestreng. Given at Wittenberg, on

JEsus. 

Hail! | am returning Emser's letter, my dear Spalatin, 
the man who threatens more than he can carry out. If | let 
my spirit shoot the reins, they would soon realize against 
whom they wrote. For Eck, too, has begotten a new 
offspring worthy of his paternity, a cesspool of invective, 
writing for the goat, 1) a worthy protector for such a 
wretched protégé. But enough of that. 

| also take care of the prince's welfare and diligently 
recommend others to take care of it; | ask you to thank 
him for us that he has sent the game. 

We were expecting you to come here, so that | could 
talk to you, among other things, about the cries of the 
widow, with which she is tormenting me. | am afraid that 
the voice of the oppressed will rise to heaven, for she 
complains that she is almost forced to beg. 

| have been invited by the Princess 2) of Anhalt in

Hail! Here the council of Kemberg sends a petition to 
the prince, my dear Spalatin, in which he complains that 
he is being oppressed by quite unreasonable interest 
rates. In this matter | also ask for your service, since you 
can do it without danger. If now the most illustrious prince 
did not want to get involved in the whole business (which 
is also not necessary), that he changed the matter 
suddenly and by force, then help that at least that is 
obtained that those people recognize that they have the 
prince's favor and applause in this. For the people there 
are being sucked dry in the most miserable way by this 
most fierce usury, and its number is increasing daily by 
the exceedingly evil example of sinning. For even the 
priesthoods and offices of worship, then also certain 
brotherhoods, are maintained by these god-robbing 
interests and godless robberies, which should take place 
least of all. You should know that you are serving the will 
of God in the true service of God, with everything that 
you can do and obtain in this matter, so that it is done by 
the prince.

Synagogue, who with the most fervent sighs ask for the 
coming of Christ into the flesh. But you, who surpass me 
by far in sharpness of judgment and fullness of learning, 
see if he 5) did not want to call them interjecta for the 
sake of it, because such psalms are provided with 
repetitive verses (interstalares), as in Virgil's Eclogue

Ducito ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite 

Daphnim 
[Bring from the city, my songs, o bring home the daphnis], 
for the 67th Psalm says twice [in the Vulg.v.2.], "GOtt, be 
gracious to us"; twice, "It thank thee, GOtt, the peoples"; 
twice, "It bless uys GOtt." But how often the 80th say, "O 
LORD GOD of hosts," you yourself know well. But this is 
contradicted by the fact that he says: There are in sum 
two. 7) For the 107th is called with greater right 
(pulchrius) a psalm with repetition verses (interstalaris) 
than those two. Therefore, | assume that it would be 67 
with a corrupted number instead of 107, especially since 
in this book he does not prefix a psalm of a higher number 
to one of a lower number, nor a psalm of a lower number 
to a psalm 8) of the very lowest number. And in such a 
way only the 80th and the 107th [Psalm] would be psalms 
with repetition verses. There you have all that | have.

| did not want to send Eck's dirty speeches, which he 
published against the articles | defended; you will be able 
to see them at present, if you wish. "The unlearned

The highly learned, extremely honest man Georg 
Spalatin, Christ's servant, his superior in the Lord. 


JEsus. 


Hail! | will hand over the letters to the bishops 
mentioned today or tomorrow, my dear Spalatin. In the 
meantime, | am sending what you wrote for the parish of 
Lochau, and | am sending you this man, who is suitable 
according to my and many people's judgment. He is a 
diligent, learned and pious man, named Jakob Gropp. 
The fact that he did not become a Master of Liberal Arts 
was caused solely by the lack of expenses, and nothing 
else; he will in any case be able to attain this degree in 
the future year, when he, provided with this parish, has 
become somewhat richer (pinguior == fatter). Therefore, 
the master's degree seemed to me to be no obstacle, 
since in knowledge and good manners, then also in 
administration of the priestly office, he is completely 
equal to the men who have this degree. Therefore | 
commend him to you and through you to the most 
gracious Prince in the name of the Lord, Amen. Farewell 
and pray for me. January 31, 1520, Martin Luther, 
Augustinian.

To Georg Spalatin, court preacher and secretary to 
the Prince of Saxony, his superior in Christ, who 
is extremely dear to the Lord. 

JEsus. 

Hail! | am finally sending the letters to the venerable 
bishops; you may see if it is useful to send them, 
especially since the bishop of Meissen, through the 
artifices of the Leipzig party, has issued a public 
prohibition note 1) against my sermon on the 
Sacrament, with which, as is to be expected, many 
others will cooperate. But | will issue a counter-note, 
and, God willing, pull off these quite unrhymed larvae of 
ignorance in this Shrovetide season. 

Eck heckles Carlstadt and also me in the most dreadful 
way, in a new booklet 2) against him, to which Carlstadt 
is preparing to reply, but in such an ill-considered heat 
of mind that he has given the booklet the title: "Wider 
den ganz unverninftigen Esel und angeblichen Doctor" 
2c. Persuade him, if it concerns, that he either desist, 
to revile him again, or refrain from answering altogether, 
for the wretched sophist has made himself enough of a 
laughing stock and disgust by this book, so that nothing 
else can be done to him by an Auder's reviling, except 
perhaps a cover for his exceedingly great 
disgracefulness, by which he might appear less 
disgraceful. For | have begun to despise this man to 
such an extent that | have never despised anyone more. 
Carlstadt does not allow me to remind him, but it is also 
not safe if he learns that | have made this known to you, 
as he is a man who is weak through suspicion.

228 Letters from the year 1520. 


In the Tessaradekas, the dedication letter 1) has been 
omitted, too great an indelicacy for the book and to my 
chagrin. The first sexterne 2) has been printed in my 
absence. It will also be finished in German soon. We are 
forced to be slow, both because of the amount of 
business and the lack of types. In any case, the German 
"Schutzrede" will go out, and at the same time "the 
unlearned canons". 

| remember that | wished Philip a wife who would be 
suitable for his way, and | still do not regret this wish. | 
fear an accident for the man who is used to meet great 
spirits (ingenia) in general, both because he is a man 
who does not care about the household at all, and also 
does not take care of his body at all; but | do not yet see 
that the man is inclined to this way of life. 

| again send a petition from the well-known widow. 
She sighs and weeps bitterly and calls God to witness 
that she will be a beggar if she does not get the house 
back. | try in vain with the canons and see that no help 
will be left unless the most noble prince does something 
in this matter. | certainly do not want her to become a 
beggar for this reason, lest she be one of the widows of 
whom the Scriptures say that God is their judge. 

| send - but send it back again - the Meissner 
prohibition note, namely the fruit of a great spitefulness 
and an even greater ignorance. Be well and pray for me.

somewhat violently and proudly. He works on the Latin edition of 
the same.

2c. 


JEsus. 

Hail! See, there you have your, 4) rather our 
Tessaradekas, my dear Spalatin. You may not be 
surprised that my answer against the stumbling, foolish 
and foolish (tojoensem et talpensem) note 5) is 
somewhat vehement and proud. Here it is a matter of 
those who triumph against me by striking the notes 
everywhere, therefore it was necessary that their triumph 
should not lack such a hymn of praise, so that there 
would be a proper lid for the vessel. Now | am writing a 
Latin reply against it, which is a little more detailed, to 
which the note itself must be added at the end. But you 
hesitate too much to send it back. For tomorrow, or the 
day after tomorrow at the latest, it will be needed. 
Farewell and pray for me. February 11, 1520 

Martin Luther, Aug. 


3) A transmission of the writing, which Aurifaber assumes 
(also Kolde, M. Luther, Vol. |, p. 241), is not to be thought of, 
because the writing was in print (see the following letter), as well 
as the transmission of the manuscript (Erl. Briefw.), which was 
needed for the printing. That the manuscript was not sent to 
Spalatin before it was published is clear from Luther's letter to 
Spalatin of February 18. This has already been correctly noted 
by De Wette. See St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 482, note.

To the learned and godly man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 
court preacher and secretary to the Prince of 
Saxony, his [friend] in the Lord. 

JEsus. 

Hail! | have, dearest George, by the grace of God, 
great courage against the Meissen conflagration, and 
you will see that | obey your advice, that | answer as 
kindly as | can. Yes, you and yours shall get to see the 
[Latin] copy before it is published, which would also have 
happened with this 1) if the printing had not preceded 
your letter. However, out of reverence for the bishop, | 
have not touched the ulcer of the note in this writing 
either, which is indeed blasphemous and more against 
the Gospel of Christ than any raging heresy ever was; | 
will show this to the descendants and at the same time 
convict them of their ignorance; if they do not take care, | 
will pull them through.

| will not suffer an error condemned in the Gospel of God 
to be proclaimed even full of all the angels of heaven, how 
much less by the idols of an earthly little church. 

If it seems good to you, let us show this favor to the 
enemies, and write to them, if there are people who want 
to hear you, and admonish and ask them that they may act 
against Luther as wisely and cautiously as they can, let it 
be spared them in this writing with great diligence, so that 
when they begin to want to escape the frost, they will not 
be overwhelmed by the snow. For if God does not deprive 
me of reason (which He may do according to His gracious 
will (nothing)), it will happen, if they stir the muck (as they 
say) more, that it will stink further and worse: not that | wish 
to threaten so great and many men, but that | am sorry and 
pity their disgrace, which they have irrevocably contracted 
by this unfortunate note, and that | offer them in this way 
what | would wish to be done against me in this matter. | 
would not take the treasures of the whole world that | 
should be found to be the author of this note. 

And yet God wanted them to keep right counsel 
lamong themselves and either keep completely silent or 
purify themselves in the way of love. But if they should 
lbegin to pursue the matter by force, threats, science, 
shrewdness, art or cunning, the Lord will have an 
understanding and grant me that they can hardly fool my 
lobserving nose 3). If they should pretend in an unholy way, 
las they have done in this note, they will spoil the matter. If 
they had published the note according to my advice, they 
would have written in this way: Behold, dear brethren, a 
certain sermon has gone forth which many 
misunderstand, therefore do not think that it pleases the 
lauthor of it to be so understood. In this way, they would 
not have harmed me, and they would not have harmed 
themselves and everyone else.

But now they fall in with full fury and condemn what | have 
never written. Yes, | have written the opposite, and that 
under my name. Or at least they would have written to 
me privately and admonished me to issue a statement. 
But they have left the path of this justice and that love 
and have begun with violence and injustice: what wonder 
is it if such an evil beginning is followed by an evil 
continuation? 

| am surprised and cannot be surprised enough that 
there are such coarse and unlearned people in Meissen 
and Leipzig, or that their spitefulness is so great that they 
have even lost their common sense. Up to now, | have 
not had any adversaries whom | would have despised 
just as much: so great is either their narrow-mindedness 
or their imprudence. However it may be, if you can, help 
them so that they do not provoke me. | hold them captive, 
and so captive that they will expose themselves to the 
highest reproach if they do not act with gentleness. If it 
should seem good to you, | too will write to the bishop 
about this matter.... | would write to Duke George if | did 
not know that what comes from me is either not read or, 
if it is read, is not heard. 

You should know that Walpurga Landmann never had 
a curator or a guardian, but gave the house to the church 
solely out of her will. | have dealt a lot with the provost 1), 
but he is up to his ears in his rights sunk, and chattering, 
that what is once given to God cannot be given back, 
although the giver would have to beg eternally or die of 
hunger, and he has referred me to God and to the 
sacrament of the mass, that | would like to deal with 
Christ, whether He Himself wants to talk to me and give 
back what | desired. The law-abiding (juridicus) even 
considers these antics to be serious. When | told him why 
they could accept things given in Christ's place and not 
also give them back in the same place, he insisted.

that a man cannot return what has been given to him. 
The Gospel does not penetrate into these minds, which 
are completely taken in by these positions, as if he 
[Christ] did not reveal abundantly in the Gospels what 
one should do to one's neighbor in these matters, where 
necessity and love require it. Fare well and pray for me.

issued Eck the letters of our prince and our answers and 
his German letters to the prince, which are written 
exceedingly spitefully. | will send them as soon as 
possible through the bearer. | believe that the man is

Your learned and righteous man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 
Christ's servant, princely Saxon court preacher, 
his [friend] in the Lord. 

JEsus. 

Hail! Finally, the Bishop of Merseburg has sent my 
messenger back to me with his letter, which he held up 
there for three days; | am still awaiting the Cardinal's 
reply in Mainz. | have now read the letter. | do not dislike 
it, except that he confesses that he was moved by 
writings and reports of others against my sermon, which 
he perhaps never read, but condemns by believing it. 
Then he condemns, not without rhyme, the strife in the 
cause of the Roman pope, as if | really took pleasure in 
being tossed to and fro in these storms, and did not 
rather wish to live in peace, which he desires, as he 
writes. But when we are quite healthy, we give advice to 
sick people, like Terence 2) If you were here, you would 
judge differently. 

That the Cardinal at Mainz has forbidden the 
mendicant monks [to beg], | do not believe that it was 
done out of spite against me; 3) Magdeburg is also full of 
many other complaints against him, as our prior says, 
who has returned. For he is beginning to tyrannize and 
to dare everything by offending even his spiritual great 
ones. Who knows what he is called to do in the 
administration of such great matters? The Lord will use 
him (do not doubt it) for some future monstrosity. As 
much as there is in me, | wish very much that this 
mendicancy would be abolished from the ground up. This 
is one of the articles that Eck makes a heretical one for 
me and praises highly. For | hate this quite shameful 
livelihood, and even today would rather learn a trade with 
which | could support myself than live in such a way, and 
| will die in this heresy, even against Eck's will.

After | have asked my friends for advice about the 
letter to our prince, | find that it can by no means be done 
without danger to godliness that | offer peace in my name 
or according to my wishes. | have so far offered it 
sufficiently and alone; | have always been drawn into the 
bargain by force, and it is not advisable to withdraw my 
hand as long as Eck cries out, for | am forced to 
command the matter to God and to let myself be led, 
since the ship is exposed to the winds and floods. One 
thing | can do is to call upon GOD's mercy; word has 
been given me of some mighty storm if GOD does not 
resist Satan. | have seen his thousand-fold thoughts to 
my and many people's destruction. 





What do you want? Never has the word of godliness been 
acted upon without commotion, noise and danger. The 
word has infinite majesty, it directs great things, and is 
wonderful in high and low, as the prophet [Ps. 78, 31. 
Vulg.] says: "It killeth the fat in Israel, and preventeth the 
elect thereof." Therefore, in this matter, one must either 
despair of peace and tranquility, or deny the Word. It is a 
war of the LORD, who has not come to send peace. 
Beware, therefore, that you do not hope that Christ will be 
promoted on earth with peace and comfort, seeing that he 
fought with his own blood, and after him all the martyrs. | 
have hitherto unconsciously taught and held all the things 
of John Hus; John Staupitz also taught them in the same 
ignorance; in short, we are all unconsciously Hussites, 
yea, Paul and Augustine are quite proper Hussites. 
Behold, | beseech you, the monstrosities into which we 
fall without the Bohemian leader and teacher. | am 
amazed and do not know what to think, seeing such 
terrible judgments of God on mankind, that the quite 
obvious evangelical truth, now already publicly burned 
more than a hundred years ago, is considered 
condemned, and one is not allowed to confess this. Woe 
to the earth! Farewell. Martin Luther.

Conrad Pellicanus to Luther. 


About the printings of Luther's writings that appeared in Basel; 
about the reading of them in the Minorite monastery there and 
the enumeration of Luther's patrons. Of the absence of the 
Cardinal of Sion; of the departure of Capito to Mainz and that of 
Rhenanus to Schlettstadt. On the death of Bruno Amerbach. 
About Luther's opponents among the Minorites; rebuke of the 
Erasmians. Encouragement of Luther to continue his literary 
work. About the rumor that Luther had escaped to Bohemia, that 
he and the Elector had been banished, and that his picture had 
been burned in Rome. Miscellaneous news. 


1) Dialogus, meaning the farce Eckius dedolutus. Compare 
St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, introduction, p. 29b. The passage 
referring to Scheurl (Riederer, Beitrag zu den Reformations - 
Urkunden, p. 162) reads: "Friends: Now we want to summon 
physicians from Nuremberg, for there you also possess 
innumerable friends, namely Wilibald, and half of your soul, the 
twister (dolorem) *) of both rights. Corner: Dolorem you say? 
Friends: Doctorem we wanted to say. Eck. Who then? because 
| do not understand this sufficiently. Friends: That braggart, the 
rude, haughty, presumptuous man, whose father, whose mother, 
- don't you know him? How should | not know him, since | was 
recently at his wedding? | also used him as a spy to find out 
about Luther's affairs, because he acted as if he were his friend." 
- Wilibald is Pirkheimer. - In a letter to Otto Beckmann of March 
27, 1520 (Scheurls Briefouch, p. 100), Scheurl writes that 
although he hears that such a writing, in which he is mocked, is 
being circulated, he does not seem to have read it yet

To the famous and most Christian theologian 
Doctor Martin Luther, Augustinian, at 
Wittenberg. 

|, Conrad Pellican, Minorite, am so devoted to you, 
the chosen confessor of Christ, Martin Luther, and 
wish you all the best that, among my most noble 
intentions, | continue to pray to the divine mercy with 
pious sighs, praising you completely. With a sincere 
heart | implore, for the sanctification of his glorious 
name and for the prosperity of the church, that the 
merciful Lord, whose cause you have recently 
bravely begun and are happily carrying on, may long 
grant you to us unharmed, of great courage and 
victorious in the word of Christ, and may he preserve 
you; | hope that you will by no means be put to 
shame. He gives a great many for the sake of prayer, 
for he will condescend to hear those who are 
sincerely concerned for the welfare of his church. 

By writing you a few things about many things, | 
will run through them briefly; | ask you not to be 
displeased with them. What has been done so far in 
studies at Basel, you can take from the [here printed] 
writings. 2) Last fall, while Frobenius was absent, his 
people printed the explanation of the power of the 
pope 3). Soon another, Andreas,*) has spread all 
your small works in two or three parts equally, as you 
can see, which | have long since read, except for the 
defense against Eck, 5) which | have begun to write. 


since it did not appear until July. Pirkheimer is the author of it. In 
the letter just mentioned, Scheurl still sends his regards to 
Luthern. 

2) In the manuscripts and the Analecta: accipe dee litteris (?). 
The Erl. Briefw. has taken up Knaake's Conjectur offered in the 
Stud. und Krit. 1884, p. 593: accipe brevibus (?). The former 
reading seems to us not only not "incomprehensible", but quite 
appropriate. Pellican sent all these writings at the same time as 
his letter to Luther, as is evident from what follows. In reference 
to the printing of Cratander, he says: tu videbis, and after 
enumerating the various printings: Omnia haec forsan simul cum 
his meis literis ex Franckfordensi emporio recipies et gaudebis. 

3) Luther's explanation of his thirteenth thesis on the power of 
the pope, St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, 720. 

4) Cratander. 

5) This refers to "Luther's defense against the malicious 
judgment of Johann Eck on some articles imposed on him by 
some brothers. (St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, 1370.)

languages and is an excellent professor of general 
mathematics, has been an interpreter of scholastic 
theology among the brothers for some years, is 
extraordinarily gifted and so far the most eager of my 
listeners. He has preferred to all his studies the work 
of translating your "ten commandments" into German, 
and has had them printed. This has brought immense 
benefit to the printer 5) but will be of far more use to 
the souls of the readers. Another very learned 
professor of theology, who was formerly at Tubingen 
and now teaches the brethren at Freiburg, is Johann 
von Ulm,® small in body but very great in gifts, an 
exceedingly good, God-fearing man (religiosus), and 
also very well known to Melanchthon. He _ is 
extraordinarily zealous for your writings, and is 


pope, if he is not irritated by them, is not ill-disposed 
against you, because he judges far more modestly of 


the state and person of the pope than those Curtisani,

Rufach, 1) he has been my guest for the second time, 
he seemed to me to be a good man; | would like to 
know whether he left you or not. Perhaps he fears (as 
many of ours do) the superiors of our order, the 
General Officer, a very astute Scotist. In time they will 
become tame. | have recently received the writings of 
a certain very good father, who speaks of the great 
stain of your vehemence in writing against Eck, and 
is sorry about it, so that Eck seems to him to be more 
modest, whose writings against you | have not yet 
read. In your other writings | do not miss a great 
modesty. In writing of such content, it seems to be 
necessary that such sophists are annoyed, otherwise 
they would not care about it at all. The 
sacrilegiousness of certain followers of Erasmus, 
who arouse an inhuman hatred against all monks 
without distinction, declaring them superstitious, 
Pharisees and impostors, is evident everywhere. All 
in all, they are enemies of the ceremonies, revile 
confession, the divine service, the ecclesiastical 
customs. It is true that in these things many things 
should be reformed; | do not deny that. | abhor many 
abuses, but they go too far: They write against the 
gospel, against Paul, against the fathers, quite rashly, 
not that they want or do anything better, but that they 
break the bruised reed, introduce worse things for it, 
confess nothing, pray nothing, ridicule everything, 
resist the good, judge most severely everything that 
displeases them, push those who are already inclined 
to vices, unbelief and wisdom of the flesh even more 
to the abyss. | wish that you, when writing, restrain 
the immoderate undertakings, set a measure for 
them, how far the monks are to be improved, but not 
exterminated. Certainly it is a good thing (praestat) to 
take our senses captive in Christ, to avoid the 
dangers of the world, to stand by one another through 
fraternal communion, to implore Christ's grace 
without ceasing, and the ceremonies do not make 
this unjust. | wish you would rebuke 2) such efforts; 
they may be charmed by lies. 3) Out of all power, the 
followers of Erasmus crush monasticism with words, 
writings and deeds; as once the Origenists, so the 
Erasmians deceive Erasmus.

Continue, we all implore, with the remaining 
epistles. Do not pass over Isaiah and immediately 
[continue] with the Psalter. We will pray that the Holy 
Spirit will assist you. You may write what you want to 
present, not with high and grand words, but in the 
word of truth, according to the testimony of the 
Scriptures, in Christian fervor, fearing nothing, for the 
sake of the church and to save the holy liberty of 
consciences, whatever adversities may occur. 

There is a rumor, but a vague and dark one, that 
you fled to Bohemia last summer. Now they say about 
the ban against your prince and against you, yes, they 
gossip that your image was burned in Rome. So you 
are a fairy tale to the world. It would do you good to 
hear from you often, so that we do not believe that 
you have died. Would God that the trade would go out 
to a fruitful general concilium! | would hope that many 
things would become better; the shepherds would 
wake up and yield to the worldly, and act godly. Must 
not the Roman ordinaries or use concede what is 
intelligible? Now we have prayers throughout Lent, 
we don't know from which saints, all other churches 
to laugh at, what our fathers have thought up so far 
only some 4) that no one has been able to do it. | am 
silent about so many fictitious old and new fables, 
which are generally inserted without special choice, 
which we are forced to hear and believe even against 
our will. There is no one with us who is not very 
favorable to you. There are a few old clowns, 
remnants of the old breed, who perish with spite, want 
to bite, but do not dare; they are held down by the 
crowd and the erudition of yours. Two Augustinian 
doctors do not openly confess yours either, because 
they were once instructed far differently than you 
teach, but they like to hear that such a glorious 
ornament of their order is praised. The prior of the 
regular canons of St. Leonhard, an extraordinary 
friend of the studies and of the students, loves you 
from the bottom of his heart to such an extent that he 
has decided to go to Wittenberg to see you and to 
converse with you, since the time for the Westphalian 
chapter has approached. | have read_ the 
interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians for the

frequent annexes.

248 Letters from the year 1520. 

To the exceedingly righteous Lord Alexius Chrosner 
of Colditz, canon of Altenburg, his [friend] in 
Christo. 


JEsus. 


Hail! Georg Spalatin, your colleague and our mutual 
friend, once demanded and forced a letter from me 1) in 
which | briefly drafted a way in which one should confess, 
because the complaint reached me everywhere and 
among others that the way of confession was extremely 
burdensome and completely confused. Since | realized 
that | was being asked to do something spiteful and 
unbearable to the ecclesiastical tyrants, | postponed it for 
a while until | was forced to calm my friend down to some 
extent by means of a confidential and private letter. Since 
he had now communicated this booklet or letter to ong 
and the other, which he could also do with full right, and 
had not offended me, it finally began to be in danger and 
also to be desired in print. 3) 

Mindful here of how my friends also take care of my 
syllables, | have been forced to reclaim the rambling 
writing* ) again, and, although in a hurry and very busy 
with other things, to overlook it again myself, and, after a 
few things have been changed and added, to anticipate 
an edition on the part of others. | know that this matter 
should have been left to far more learned people, then (ag 
they say) held back for nine years and considered again 
and again; 


correct. It cannot be assumed, as we have already stated in the 
19th volume of our edition, Introduction, p. 37, note 2, that Luthey 
sent "the way how to confess" to Spalatin "without preface" (which 
has been omitted in print, see St. Louis edition, vol. XV, annex 
no. 29) on March 25, and on the day after, March 26, aske 
Chrosnern to allow that this writing be dedicated to him. We stil 
hold to the assumption that "VII. Calend. Aprilis" from XII. Cal, 
Aprilis [March 21] will be read.

this writing from Spalatin.

But the die was cast, and we could no longer do anything 
else as we pleased. | have begun to presume on the spirit 
that knows nothing of slow undertakings. | therefore ask 
you to allow this, whatever it may be in trifles or things, to 
go out under your name, because since you are equal to 
Spalatin in almost every respect, you should not appear 
unequal to him in this either. Fare well, and leave me in 
the hands of the Lord and excuse me. Wittenberg, March

To the Magister Georg Spalatin. JEsus. 


Hail! | have received the question, my dear Spalatin, 
which you asked, what the word of Christ Joh. 15, 5. 
means: "Without me you can do nothing." First of all, | 
believe that you are familiar with the two discerptiones 
(distinctiones) of the Magistri nostri taught in this 
passage, the first of which is: the influence 
(influentiam) of God is either a general one or a special 
one, which they understand in this way: by the general 
influence we are able to do what is proper to nature 
without grace, which those think is neither merit nor sin, 
but a kind of neutral thing, or morally good works, as 
walking, standing, working, praying, eating, and what we 
see men do outwardly that is not manifestly evil; By the 
special influence we are able to do that which is proper 
to grace and above nature, namely, to do meritorious 
things only and to avoid sins, so that the general 
influence is a being and working of nature, the special 
one a being and working of grace. Then follows the other 
distinction: doing something else in a beginning way, and 
doing something else in a perfect way; that in a beginning 
way belongs to the general influence, that in a perfect 
way to the special. Then "Without me you can do 
nothing" will mean: that is, in a perfect way, or through 
the special influence; but certainly in a beginning way, 
that is, through the general influence we can do 
something; this is as much as to say: through our powers 
(by the general influence standing still) we can prepare 
ourselves to receive the grace or the special influence, 
that we can do something meritorious, but we cannot, 
since the same influence stands still, also do something 
out of our own power. 


do something meritorious with our strength. This is how 
this saying has been interpreted and understood up to 
now. 

Incidentally, Christ, who condemns this general 
influence or being of nature altogether, therefore, 
because nature cannot but seek what is hers, and abuse 
the gifts of God, speaks unreservedly and without 
distinction, that without the special influence (as they call 
it) or grace of God nothing can be done that is not worthy 
of fire in the sight of God, as he continues by saying [v. 
6.] "He that abideth not in me is cast away as a branch, 
and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into 
the fire, and they must burn." Behold, the branch apart 
from Christ not only does not green up and bear fruit, but 
also withers (that is, goes bad and perishes), and not 
only goes bad and withers, but is also gathered and 
separated from the vine and thrown into the fire 2c. In 
such a way, then, he who is driven only by the general 
influence and forces of nature, becomes worse and 
worse, and comes further from Christ, and is prepared 
for the fire, however much he may outwardly appear to 
be moral and well-doing, so that we see from this, that 
without Christ we can do nothing either by a general or a 
special influence, and everything that is done by the 
general influence alone, however great it may be, is more 
against Christ than for Christ, which is sufficiently evident 
in the hypocrites, who do great and many things, but from 
an exceedingly evil disposition. That is why Christ 
exhorts with such great zeal that in him, as the vine, the 
branches should abide, because it is impossible that they 
should not continually grow worse if they do not abide in 
him, just as it is impossible that those who do not abide 
in the way should not continually go more and more 
astray if they do not return to the way. Therefore, no 
distinction is necessary here, as if the general influence 
is not the way of error, since this [influence] is a gift of 
God by grace, free of charge, given to such people who 
are not worthy of the gift and always misuse it, just as 
wine and gold are given to the godless people in 


254 Letters from the year 1520. 


No. 284. 285. 286. 255 





The word "influence" is turned into a daily abuse, where 
it could be said that the thing flowing from God (influxam) 
is good, but its use cannot be good if those who use the 
thing are not first made healthy by grace. Thus no one 
uses the general influence (that is, the dangerous word), 
which is the being and working of nature, other than in an 
evil way and to nothingness, unless he remains as a vine 
in Christ. For as to the pure all things are pure, so to the 
impure nothing is pure, Titus 1:15, and as with the saints 
all things work together for good, so with the wicked all 
things work together for evil. For who can deny that al 
fornicator, an adulterer, a murderer, a blaspohemer does 
his work by the help of the general influence? For how 
could he do these things if he had not the being and the 
working of nature? But who would dare to say that this 
means to do good in a beginning way and to prepare it for 
grace? Thus a work apart from grace, however good it 
may seem, because there is no good disposition in the 
heart apart from grace, cannot be other than evil against 
grace, and can in no way begin to be able to do something 
for grace. But all this concerns the matter (materiam) of 
grace and free will, which is exceedingly great and 
extensive, rather very brief, therefore it cannot all be 
stated in so few words. Fare well and pray for me. At the 
hour you left. [1520. On Friday in Easter week (April 13).]

Hail! | am returning your dean's letter, enclosing th

concerned, | will see to it. 

Every day, a number of students stream in, but th

leave again. For Adrian, too, we are unable to procure 
dwelling sufficient for man, and it does not please us t 
expel others for his sake, which is what he has begun t

will we consent to anyone being expelled from the hous 
of the treasurer or anyone else against his will; but if the

grateful.

do it soon. For | have noticed a certain trifle in the matter.

gracious lord and patron.

Most Serene, Highborn, Most Gracious Prince and 
Lord, My Sublime Service Be E. C. F. G. always ready 
beforehand. Most gracious Lord, E. C. F. G.'s letter to 
me, | have received submissively, and understood, as E. 
C. F. G. pleases, that | was entitled to the parish lands 
for the same perpetual interest, in order to avoid future 
quarrels. However, | am surprised, most gracious Lord, 
that Giinther von S[taupitz] always pretends to your 
churfl. Your Grace always claims such a cause of quarrel, 
which has now been acted upon for almost the third time, 
and has always become worse. There must remain 
quarrels where one acts in this way. | can't understand 
how this some hoof has become so quarrelsome in 
Gunther's time, so he has mixed more hoofs among other 
hoofs much more, about which no complaint of quarrel 
comes. If | had not seen it myself, my lord, | would also 
think that the quarrel was the cause, and not the great 
advantage, and the parish disadvantage. But, my lord, | 
am not powerful in this matter alone, and now | know so 
much about what happiness arises where it happens 
without the will of the convent, that | am glad, and E. C. 
F. G. that it has come to this, that the letters are returned 
to the Convention, and that | am out of the matter. | find, 
however, that the parish priest and the convent are in no 
way willing to let Ginther have his hoofs, so that | report 
their cause here to the elector's grace and, as much as | 
am aware of it, do something about the matter. The dog 
is so often beaten over the nose that it once becomes 
shy. For this reason, | request, in addition to the 
Convention, that Your Electoral Grace will take our 
opinion into consideration. Your Grace will graciously 
accept our opinion for the best, or forgive us for a while. 
We want to owe this to your honor and humbly diligence 
before God. Given at Wittenberg, on Monday [after]

would not allow him to go to Zerbst himself and pay his 
respects to the Prince of Brunswick in his own cause. For 
someone from Brunswick has written to him that he 
should do this. Then he also asks this, that you write 
again to D. Busso von Alvensleben about the Hebrew 
books of which we have written before. What kind of 
person this may be, | do not know, you may watch. 

Dear, listen, what | am very surprised about in regard 
to my cause: Alveld's book has begun to please D. 
Heynitz 1) at Meissen, as D. Wolfgang Stehlin reports, 
who also likes it. | ask you, is it not surprising that such

highly venerable and honorable [friend]. 

Hail! | too knew that Thomas 4) could not postpone 
his matter, my dear sir; but | am glad that everyone is 
eager for the word of God. | will indeed use the advice 
and help of my friends and make an effort to see if we can 
provide you, worthy sir, with caplains. In the meantime, 
let your constancy be like yourself, that is, constancy in 
the Lord. It is nothing new nowadays, when the world is 
agitated because of the word of God. Herod, and with him 
all Jerusalem, is frightened by the mere preaching that 
Christ has been born; why should not the earth tremble 
and the sun be darkened when one hears of the death of 
Christ? But it is a sign to me that the doctrine is sound, 
when many, and great and wise men, are offended at it. 
For so it is said in Ps. 78:31 [Vulg.], "And he slew their fat 
ones, and hindered the elect in Israel," and [Luc. 2:34], 
"He is set for a sign to be contradicted, and for the fall and 
rising of many," not among the Gentiles, but "in Israel" 
and "the elect." The foolish, the weak before the world, 
and that which is nothing, God always chooses [1 Cor. 1,

Gunther Staupitz has, according to all of us and also 
according to his own judgment, been invented in such a 
way that he has deceived us by an enormous 
overstatement. This little soup is getting sour to me, so 
that it makes me disgusted to act in such matters. For 
who would believe that anyone would be so audacious, 
especially such a man who is so close to us, that he 
should deceive our trust in such a gross and impudent 
manner? But we have accepted his excuse that he did 
not know the value of the two pieces. Therefore, we 
expect the declaration of invalidity (Cassationowem) of

invalidated everything out of twofold right and name.

Hail! Although you only send me your greetings, my

write, but briefly, as my occupation permits. Crotus has 
also written to you from Bamberg, as he did to me. | am 
surprised that his letter has not reached you, for | have, 
if | am not mistaken, arranged it very beautifully and 
faithfully, although he has written that | should tear it up 
if you were not present. My letter had gone to Italy when 
he left, and he did not know that it came to meet him. Eck 
seizes the coveted fame in Rome. He was led by the 
Cardinal of the Four Crowned 1) to the holy pope and 
kissed the holy feet, again the pope kissed him, to the 
astonishment of all, and that since he was sitting publicly 
before all eyes on the chair of his majesty. Would God 
that they would also lick, lick, spit and bite each other in 
such a way, writes the one who writes: Luther has 
gracious gods in Rome, but no men. What do you think 
will become of it? Perhaps the sky will fall, and many pots 
will be smashed. Silvester Prierias has spewed another, 
so blasphemous slobber, 3) that reading these things 
alone almost kills me. We will publish this booklet, which

Hail! What you have asked, my venerable father, 
about the way in which one should begin and conclude a 
sermon, does not agree with the usage of others. For | 
omit lengthy prefaces, and use briefly these words: "That 
the word of God may be fruitful to us and pleasing to God, 
let us first invoke His divine grace, and say a heartfelt 
Hail Mary, or Pater noster." Then | immediately recite the 
text without any subject, and either explain David or 
present the teachings from it. At the end | say: "That's 
enough of that", or: "Another time more". Or, "Let this be 
said of it, let us call upon God and His grace, that we may 
do this," or thus, "God help us." After that, in very short 
words: "Let us be commanded spiritually and worldly, 
especially 2c., for those and all who are only guilty, let us 
pray one Our Father in common". After that, as all stand 
up: The blessing of God the Father 2c. Amen. This is my 
way of preaching. Fare well in the Lord. Wittenberg, on

The wretched men rage against me and seek my 
soul, but Christ lives and reigns. My cause is being 
pursued in Rome (as friends from Rome write) with great 
power on Eck's incentives, 2) who is the one spirit [1 
Kings 22, 21. f.] of the papal men. What they may 
accomplish, Christ will see. Everything else you will learn 
from our Lang. 

In the meantime, you will forgive me for writing less 
frequently. By the way, so that | henceforth write more 
often, see to it that you frequently prod me when | am 
lazy, or encourage me when | am busy. If | do not reply

To the learned and pious man Georg Spalatin, Christ's

JEsus. 


Hail! It has seemed good to me as well as to many 
others, my dear Spalatin, that Philip should not be 
burdened with the lecture on Pliny, because of the 
apostle Paul, whom he reads with such great fruit. The 
listeners must not be deprived of this, since the fruit of 
Pliny can in no way be compared to it, and it is to be 
feared that he might have been driven to it by the spirit, 
which must not be sacrilegiously resisted, and that it 
might be an attempt by Satan to prevent such great fruit 
under this pretense. If Pliny is to be read by all means, 
one thinks that this should be laid on the Magister Johann 
HeB 1). With regard to taking a wife, especially the one 
you mention, | do not know what will happen. | wish a 
man a wife, but which one he should take, | will neither 
be the author nor the counselor, nor do | see that the man 
hurries to take a wife. 

Although | hope that Philip does not aim at the 
Bavarians, 2) this is something | have always wished, that 
he, honored by a more respectable salary, would deprive 
them of the hope they cherish, because they know that 
he is held worse here than it would be the case with them. 
If an opportunity presents itself

He does this for his own sake, so that while theology is

German in Walch, vol. XXI, 767 (also from 1522). 


JEsus. 
Hail! Lotther has negotiated with me, my dear 
Spalatin, about the printing of the so-called Postillen. But, 
if it could happen, he wishes an imperial privilege 


1) census beneficiales, the income for the benefit s)of the 
scholarship). 

2) This letter does not exist. 

3) Because De Wette has confused vigilio and vesperi, he 
gives this letter the date: "28. Junius". But vesperi is the evening 
of the mentioned day, not the day before. 

4) Buddeus erroneously places this letter in the year 1522. De 
Wette, guided by a second postscript, which does not belong to 
this letter, but to No. 309, has given it its place between July 9 
and 10. The Erl. Briefw. has the above time determination, 
because of the mention of the printing of the Postille, which was 
already mentioned in No. 298. 





for several years, during which no one should be allowed 
to be his rival in the whole of Germany, which, as he 
thinks, can best be achieved by our prince. 5) He believes 
that in this way the Wittenberg prints would be spread 
further and faster, to the greater glory of our academy. 
And would God that we, according to this advice, had so 
far brought our writings into the hands of very many 
people, and had forestalled the violence and treachery of 
the godless enemies of truth in the hearts of the common 
people; such a swift spreading of the truth and the 
preceding instruction of the hearts might have frightened 
the tyrants of godlessness. But in this | expect what the 
Lord may also counsel through you. Fare well.

About purgatory | have nothing more certain than 
several psalms, such as the 6th [v. 6], the 13th [v. 4] and 
the 88th [v. 4] and several others that speak of this 
torment. Apart from these, Tauler evidently has the same 
in many places. Whoever does not grasp this will not 
grasp it by anyone's words, for it is beyond all reason, as 
is everything else concerning the world to come. 
Therefore, if someone has not experienced it in some 
way, he cannot add anything to these words, nor treat 
these things, nor understand them. ®

the parish church of St. Mary in Zwickau since May 13, 1520, 
when he preached his inaugural sermon. 

2) In this sermon on the Ascension, Munzer said among other 
things: the monks had mouths that one could cut off a pound of 
them, and yet they kept enough mouths. See Seidemann, 
Munzer, p. 6.

They have fought for the church, which otherwise 
would have been destroyed long ago. With such 
clamor they rage before the people, and with a 
plaintive voice they weep for me as a blasphemer 
against the holy orders, saying that | do not build up 
right 3) love, but destroy it 2c. All the false nonsense 
of my adversaries | take up to an exceedingly sweet 
exercise of faith, because the gospel comforts [Joh. 
15, 20.]: If they have received my word, they will also 
receive yours 2c. If they have perverted Christ's word, 
they will also pervert mine. | know that the word of the 
Lord does not return empty [Isa. 55:11], | know that 
the eyes of the Lord see in all places both the wicked 
and the pious [Prov. 15:3], who judge and handle 
nothing but what is implanted in their hearts. May you 
be my protector in the Lord Jesus. | beg you not to 
lend your ears to those who speak against me, not to 
believe those who have called me a fickle, biting man 
and have defamed me with a thousand other names. 
| do not give a fig for it, everything is exceedingly 
pleasant to me for the sake of my Christ; more difficult 
battles are ahead of me; | firmly trust that God will 
lead everything out through your and all Christians' 
counsel. My cross is not yet complete, for the whole 
council 4) stands by me and almost the whole city, 
which knows the exceedingly burdensome avarice of 
the hypocrites as it were from the cradle, and has 
admonished me that |, on your advice, should appeal 
to a future concilium 5) against the birds of prey that 
tear everything apart. The council has written to 
Prince John so that they do not bother those who 
preach the divine word. The council itself has heard 
almost all the words | have preached. | have also 
pleaded with the deputies of the bishop at Naumburg

and have offered them all my sermons: if they found 
anything in them contrary to Christian modesty, |

If you wish, | will answer all the superiors; if an appeal 
is to be made, | will write; if a disputation is to be 
offered, | will tell them. If you request it, | will answer 
all the superiors; if an appeal is to be made, write; if 
a disputation is to be offered to them, indicate it: 
whatever you advise, that | will do in the Lord. Both 
your ears will be ringing at such euphonious 
sentences: 

Christ died once, so that he would not die in us, nor 
would his sacrament be a comfort to us, nor would his 
example be changed into a discipleship 1). In the 
office of the Mass we obtain that we do not suffer in 
this world. 

The new preachers preach nothing but the gospel, 
but in the very worst way, contradicting by it the 
commandments of men, which are most to be 
observed. Many things must be added to the gospel. 

There is no need to live according to the gospel 
over and over again. 

If poverty were evangelical, it would not allow kings 
2c. to seize the riches of the world. 

If an example of faith must be given by the 
shepherds of souls and the monks in renouncing 
riches, so that they may preside over their sheep with 
word and example, then consequently such poverty 
must be observed by princes and kings that they have 
nothing and are beggars. 

It is not a commandment of the Gospel [Matth. 5, 
39]: If someone hits you on one cheek, you should 
offer him the other one as well. It is a citation of the 
heretics, so that they may freely persecute the 
church, and we should not call upon the secular arm. 

The failure is an imaginary thing; it must not be 
placed in the belief that we know ourselves safe by 
the same, but in the works from which the people 
must not be turned away, that the people of Zwickau, 
who have always been dear to me for twenty-four 
years, burn lights and do exceedingly virtuous works. 

Eternal blessedness cannot be called the kingdom 
of faith that is in us, since itis in the future Fatherland 
alone; here we are completely uncertain of our 
blessedness. 

He poured out these articles before the people all 
at once in one sermon. 


1) Instead of in imitatione we have assumed in imitationern. 





With all my soul | admonished this father of the 
Order of Minorites, Tiburtius von WeiBenfels, not to 
spread such great errors among the people against 
the salvation of souls, or to give me and the council 
an account of his faith through reliable scriptural 
passages and their right understanding. He, more 
cruel than any wild animal, said he would do neither 
the one nor the other, but confidently asserted that | 
should be destroyed by the whole order, and the 
furious fighter boarded the chariot, full of invective. | 
mocked his fury, fearing nothing, even if the entire 
band of mendicants should summon, mangle or 
slaughter me. | do not do my work, but the work of 
the Lord. | will not, as long as a single breath revives 
me, suffer these antics, these larvae of the 
hypocrites; | will oppose them with ceaseless 
groaning and with the trumpet of the Word of God, so 
that the name of the Lord may not be blasphemed by 
those who want to be considered Christians, since 
their feet are very hasty [Rom. 3:15], so that they 
themselves make a commotion among the people of 
God, mixing heaven and earth. If you advise it, with 
my very sincere friends, the Doctor Great and his 
deputy, and the teacher of the Greek language 2) and 
the rest of the magisters, my assistants, | will write 
against these sentences, so that the opponents of the 
cross of Christ may learn to sanctify the name of God 
and to keep their blasphemous mouths in check, that 
the light of our consolation may shine to all who are 
in the house of the Lord. Indicate what seems to you 
to be Christian in all these things. After my previous 
danger, | certainly believe that | am set apart for other 
struggles of the world. He who snatched me out of 
the most perishable mire will deliver me from the 
hand of the beast and the lion and the dragon, so that 
| shall not fear, though | walk in the midst of the 
shadow of death, for the Lord is with me, so strong a 
warrior. He will give mouth and wisdom, which all our 
adversaries will not be able to resist [Luc. 21, 15]. 
What more could | desire? Fare well in Christ, you 
model and lamp of God's friends. Given on the day of 
Margaret [July 13, in the year of the Lord 1520.

Luther complains that the rector of the university has taken 
the wrong measures against the student revolt and advocates that 
the revolt be controlled with severity. He asks for the return of 
Schaumburg's letters (No. 299).

To the learned and pious man, Georg Spalatin, 

princely court preacher, his superior in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail! | beg you, if you are able to do anything with the 
most noble prince, my dear Spalatin, then see to it that 
the prince writes a very hard and sharp letter to our 
Rector 1). For he almost involved us in murder and 
bloodshed yesterday, with his exceedingly great 
nonsense, the nonsensical man, by fomenting the uproar 
of the student mob 2) against the council and the innocent 
people, which he should have dampened. | was present 
at the meeting where they were completely resting; 
nothing was said but what only inflamed the wildness of 
the young people even more. | am sorry for this disorder 
of our university, which will finally be its disgrace. D. 
Petrus Lupinus 3) spoke very validly against the rebellion, 
but was so received by D. Thomas Eschaeus that | 
immediately got up and left when | saw that Satan was 
presiding over this assembly. Yes, it is said that the young 
people were allowed to bear arms, against the 
commandment of the prince. 

It is better that a smaller number here

he returned to Ingolstadt, and in 1523 signed with others the 17

studire than that mau be exposed to this turmoil. All who 
are good condemn this nonsense. Tomorrow | will also 
make an effort in the sermon, if, God willing, | can 
dampen something. Nothing of what the Prince has 
recently decreed has been observed; the old men have 
been more nonsensical than the young men. | know that 
this is a pretense of Satan, who, since he can nowhere 
harm the word of God that is reappearing among us, 
seeks to bring him ill-repute by this trick. But one must 
oppose it with all possible diligence, so that he does not 
keep the upper hand with these bloodthirsty people. 

By the way, | believe that you have received all the 
letters | sent, including the one from Silvester 
Schaumburg; send it back so that the friends can read it. 
Be well and pray for me. Saturday after Margaret [July

To the learned and godly man, Magister Georg 
Spalatin, princely Saxon court preacher, his in 
Christ exceedingly theureu [friend]. 

JEsus. 

Hail! That Liranian vision, my dear Spalatin, we think, 
is nothing else than this very uproar. Namely, a great 
man almost in all prophecies and visions praises the rude 
rabble. Yesterday, | delivered a speech from the pulpit 
against the riot, which was so moderate that | did not fall 
for any party, and quite simply described the fog of the 
riot, whether it be aroused by the citizens or by the 
students, and extolled the

The power of the authorities, which would be appointed 
by God, so that everything would not be devastated by 
rebellion. Dear God, how much spite | have incurred! 
They cry out that | have favored the party of the council, 
and at last reveal the thoughts of their hearts, 1) from 
which one can tell which in truth and which in pretense 
have heard our theology. For through this sieve the 
wheat and the chaff must be separated from one another. 
| can well see Satan, who, seeing that he is of no avail in 
Rome and among the foreigners, has invented this evil, 
so that he may do harm from within, and that in the worst 
possible way. Do harm. 

The matter was small at first, but behold, the more it 
is acted upon, the more sharply it seizes and emboldens 
the hearts, which is quite diabolical in nature, that by the 
very thing by which one thinks to heal, he increases the 
disease. | do not fear him, but | worry that we have 
offended the Lord through ingratitude or vain honor, that 
in his anger he has allowed Satan to creep in among the 
children of God. And this does not move me so much as 
that which | fear will happen, namely, that we, hardened 
and possessed by Satan, will be incorrigible, so that only 
our iniquities will become full, and the wrath of God will 
come and visit us with some mighty plague and put us to 
shame, because we have not received the word offered 
to us, or have not received it sufficiently. 

Here, indeed, | fear a lot and am seriously worried. In 
these last three years | have suffered some particularly 
great danger every year: first at Augsburg, second at 
Leipzig, now at Wittenberg. Therefore, it will not be 
prudence nor weapons, but humble prayer and strong 
faith that will be necessary to obtain Christ for us; 
otherwise, if we rely on our strength, it will indeed be the 
end of us. 


1) Astudent who had come from Leipzig said after the sermon: 
"If the monk does more of this kind of sermon, he will take a stone 
and hit the monk on the head or on the plates in the church"; and 
another: "If he would not leave this sermon, they would soon put 
an end to it with him. This is the testimony of Thomas Feuerlein,

Mau must not despise small things, especially those that 
take their beginning from Satan's operation.

this note. Yes, this is what Magister Eisleben has written 
out of his mouth and given it to Melchior Lotther; from 
there it comes back to us through you. Farewell and 
remember that we must suffer for the word. For since 
Silvester Schaumburg and Franz Sickingen have made 
me safe against the fear of men, the raging of the devil 
must also follow. This will be the last, since | will be

in clear words that it was a kind of childish unrest, which 
| thought had already been dealt with and quieted at that 
time. All those who want to tell the truth must be 
witnesses to this. Neither party, neither thing have | 
touched upon nor indicated, not even with one syllable, 
indeed, | have said that | will not speak of the matter, but 
in general of the dangers of any sedition. Now you see 
whether | have lied, that this matter is being carried on by

believe it is to be forgiven the carelessness, especially if 
they acknowledge their error. | have to this day despised 
the matter as a childish one, and would despise it if you 
did not thunder so. But see that you do not move me in 
vain to write to the prince in such a matter. Farewell.

always feared that these two academies, out of old 
hatred, would finally come to war (in arma ruerent), 
which, if | had not resisted, would already have been 
brought about by Arnold's letter,2) your predecessor in 
the Rectorate, which is the most impudent and unyielding 
of all [letters] that | have seen. | confess it is more blessed 
to be hurt than to hurt, but also more difficult. You hurt 
and do not notice it, and also tell us who are hurt not to 
notice it. This is what | am saying to you, my dear Peter, 
not as if any spark of my love for you had gone out, but 
rather you have kindled it more just by showing at least 
yourself alone as one who notices and hates these 
things, but so that you might have something to say 
about us before your own. My good name, my cause, my 
life, my soul is sought after by yours, and it is considered 
a miracle if | even murmur something [against it]. You are 
doing well, and remain our Peter. 1520.

to me. The sermon full of the mass 1) | send through you 
to the venerable Father Provincial and the theses of 
Melanchthon, 2) which are quite strange, but true. The 
Leipzig donkey 3) writes many books against me, and a 
certain completely unlearned man at Cremona in Italy, 
without giving his name, who, as | believe, belongs to the 
order of the preacher monks, has written against me,“ 
Eck, they say, has not yet done anything in Rome. Franz 
Sickingen promises me protection against all enemies 
through huts 5). Silvester von Schaumburg does the 
same with the Frankish nobles, whose beautiful letter to 
me | have. We no longer fear anything, but now | am

4) This is the same scribe who is mentioned in Luther's writing

This timing is according to the so-called calculus Pisanus, 
according to which the year 1520 runs from March 25, 1519 to 
March 24, 1520, therefore the writing is to be placed on 
November 22, 1519, not November 20, 1520, as the Erl. Briefw., 
vol. Il, p. 527 does. To avoid the contradiction that Luther already 
mentions the writing here in our letter, then also in the 
"Babylonian Captivity", Enders assumes two different writings by 
the same author. See Weimar edition, vol. VI, p. 486 f.

Hail! | have not written for a long time, waiting until the 
turmoil that the friends have aroused has subsided in 
you. And | am not at all pleased with Amsdorf's 
excessive favor towards one part. The students have 
never suffered what the citizens have suffered; they care 
little about that, feeling only their adversity. But enough 
of that. Everyone talks about my invectives, but no one 
pays attention to theirs. | am truly moved little by the loss 
of the prestige of my name. If all reviling is reviling, then 
no one is a greater reviler than the prophets. But we are 
so accustomed in our time to hear the truth that is against 
us. 

Envy plagues the Leipzigers, and under the larva of 
Alveld they play their tragedy; the Lord will give them 
their reward one day. Although my war trombone 7) will 
perhaps not be approved by anyone, it must be 
approved by me in order to attack the tyranny of the 
Roman Antichrist, which is corrupting the souls of the 
whole world. It is very sharp and vehement, so that at the 
same time, | hope, | will astonish those dull taunters. The 
Alveld will not be answered, but, prompted by him,

the vipers even more. 

Of Philip's salary | write nothing to the prince, if you 
should not be sufficient. What | have written before about 
this matter, | have done so that the man would have no 
reason to ever leave us; if it cannot happen, then let the 
will of the Lord be done. Yes, that he should take a wife 
and live longer, this | have done for the sake of the 
growth of the gospel; even if this cannot happen, let it be 
done. | fear that with this way of living he will not stay 
alive long. | do everything | can for the Word; perhaps | 
am not worthy to accomplish anything. |, too, would like 
to be set free from teaching and preaching, if it pleases

fault is mine. Fare well and pray for me. On the day of

petition of his before the prince through you. | did not

Hail! We cannot believe at all that Eck is in Meissen,

he hopes that the bull should be moderated, which could 
not be moderated in Meissen.

To the godly and learned man, Mr. Gunther von 
Bunan, canon of the church at Merseburg, his 
patron and superior in the Lord. 


Hail! | read your letter, my dear husband, which 
testifies to your immense confidence in me, with joy and 
amazement. For what lies not that old poisonous snake? 
The disputation was like this: Carlstadt had the chair, | 
with others, as is our way, made objections (arguebam). 
At that time the question was: whether Christ in suffering 
would also have resisted the Father, because he asked 
that the cup be taken from him, which in any case is a 
non-willing and resisting. Then the reason is put forward, 
1) that a non-willing person could also be called a hating 
and rebellious person. As this was denied, so it was not 
approved. For nothing has been asserted, but only 
spoken in confidence for and against. Dear, how great 
things we are in the habit of saying, even when we 
dispute about Catholic opinions! Don't we also disputing 
the articles of faith? Why then are those people 
nonsensical with their lies, saying that | have asserted, 
while | only opposed according to the custom of 
disputing, but did not assert anything, but rather publicly 
confessed that | do not understand all the mysteries of 
the passion of Christ? | do not know whether we have at 
the same time treated that word of the apostle [2 Cor. 
5:21], "He made him who knew no sin to be sin for us," 
and several other things which attribute sin, curse, and 
despair to Christ, as Paul and the prophets are wont to 
do; since we cannot yet grasp these, it is fair that we 
should assert nothing. | have never publicly disputed 
anything about this subject of Christ's sufferings, so | 
know nothing about it except the reason | have given for 
it. 


1) Instead of profert, we have assumed profertur. - After the 
following it is to be assumed that Luther had brought this forward. 





| have stated above. If someone has said something 
different about me, you can brazenly accuse him of lying, 
since our entire audience is also a witness. Therefore, let 
those poisonous people desist from accusing a disputant, 
or let them first condemn their Thomas, who sees 
everything Christian by proving for and against. Or do 
they want to imprison us, that it should not be allowed, 
after the custom of disputing and learning, to dispute 
articles of faith? | am ashamed that even you alone are 
so moved by these trifles. But there you have what | have 
done and how | am minded. 


Full of corner | still know nothing but that he came, 
provided with a beard, a bull and money 2) God grant that 
this is one of the damned articles: it is to be wished that 
the sack of the mendicants is off. Also | will laugh at the 
water bladder or bottle (bullum sive ampullam). | send 
the marforiils. 3) The Lord keep you for eternity, Amen.

3) Instead of Marferium, Marforium will probably be read, as

Marforius is the name of the large mutilated marble statue of a 
river god in Rome, to which all kinds of satires used to be 
attached. It will be to be thought here therefore of a satire. Thus 
Burkhardt, p. 32. The Erl. Briefw. gives here the title of a writing

Brother Martin Luther, Augustinian, to Conrad Saum, 
1) preacher in Brackenheim. 

Hail! With very special praise, my dear Conrad, this 
Magister Heilingen, 2) a man of acknowledged godliness 
and scholarship, 3) has recommended you to me, and it 
has created me not a little, that he testified that the pure 
and clean doctrine of Christ dwells constantly in your 
heart, which the sophists resist with all zeal with weapons 
and intrigues, and as they only can, from the effect of 
Satan; for who does not see that he is in them the leader 
to these troubles? 

For we have not to fight against flesh and blood, but 
against the evil spirits under heaven, which reign in this 
darkness [Eph. 6:12]. Let us therefore be constant, and 
again also hear our leader's trumpet of war, with which he 
lets himself be heard: Be valiant in the war, and fight with 
the old serpent, and ye shall receive the everlasting 
kingdom. For this Satan does not fight with us, but with 
Christ, who fights in us, who is greater than he who is in 
the world [1 John 4:4]. The Lord chooses new wars, says| 
Deborah, Judges 5:8, and we also fight not our wars, but 
the Lord's. Therefore be confident and be strong; if God 
is for us, who can be against us? [Rom. 8:31.] 

You will say: What is this? [I say this because it will 
undoubtedly happen that you hear that the Roman pope, 
through his legate Eck, has raged with a very harsh bull 
4) against Luther and his books, and against all who 
adhere to and follow him. This wretched tool of Satan is 
now in Leipzig, and trumpets his bull with 


1) Conrad Sam (dialect: Som, Saum) was one of the first 
confessors of the new doctrine in Wurtemberg. He was so 
challenged by this that he thought of leaving, but he stayed until 
1524, when he went to Ulm, where he helped to implement the 
Zwinglian Reformation. He died in 1533. 

2) According to the Erl. This is M. Joh. Geyling from Ilsfeld. In| 
the Syngramma Suevicum (Acta et scripta 
publica ecclesiae Wirtembergicae, p. 153) he is called Joannes| 
Geilingius Ulsfeldensis. Compare St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 522.

possible, but not probable for us.

444. 





with tremendous splendor and glory. | do not yet know 
what will happen, nor am | anxious to know, since | am 
certain that he who dwells in heaven cares for all things 
and has foreseen from eternity the beginning of this 
matter, the progress and the end that | expect. And 
wherever the lot will fall, it will not move me, because it 
will not fall other than according to his will, which is the 
best, wherever it may fall. As he cannot err, so must he

"your Father knows what you need before you ask him" 
[Matt. 6:8]. No leaf of a tree falls to the earth without his 
will, how much less will we fall anywhere else than where 
he wants us to fall. 

It has seemed good to me to admonish you herewith 
together with me, so that when the Spirit, who has power 
over you, comes, you may not leave your place, 5) but 
hold on to what you have, lest another receive your 
crown. Itis a small thing that we die or perish for the word, 
since it, being made flesh, died for us before; we shall rise 
with you, with whom we perish, and we who have passed 
through with it, whither it [the word] has passed through, 
shall also abide with it for ever. Therefore, see to it that 
you do not disregard your holy calling, but gratefully 
persevere in it through all adversity. He will come and not 
forgive, who will save us from all evil. Fare well in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, who strengthens and sustains our spirit and 
our knowledge, amen. Wittenberg, October 1, 1520.

To Michael Maurer (Muris), Cistercian in Old Celle. 


Luther is unconcerned that now even more opponents appear 
against him than before; the word of God must be contested by 
the powerful, and is protected by God, not by men. That the 
Scripture of the Babylonian captivity was forbidden did not 
concern him. The book of Thomas Rhadinus is Einser's work. He 
reassures his friend about the publication of his letters to him. He 
does not want to write to Duke George, because he will not 
achieve anything with it.

Gracious Lord, | have received F. G.'s letter and read 

it with great pleasure, in which | have heard F. G.'s 
special favor and grace to me, the unworthy, as well as 
his great will and desire for the holy divine truth. And

E. F. G., | will nevertheless always be diligent with my

courage for such a Christian opinion. That E. F. G. also 
takes up the cause so firmly and writes so diligently to 
my most gracious Lord, Duke Friedrich, Elector, gives me 
special hope that God will help his Gospel through E. F. 
G., even though | am not afraid of the bulls in any way, | 
have nevertheless undertaken to preach, read and write. 
However, | may have had a delusion that the Leipzigers 
would drive me from Wittenberg through the help of Duke 
George and the Bishop of Merseburg, who has created 
unspeakable bitterness against me, which | have 
nevertheless attributed to divine will. For | am well aware 
how they seek to disturb not me, but E. F. G. University

time, and now consider with joy that they have come 
upon a just cause; what God has decreed for them, let

To Joh. Greffendorf in Weimar. 


Luther is pleased about Greffendorf's good courage regarding 
the bull. About Eck's reception of the bull in Erfurt. Luther 
despises the bull, although he suspects that he will be expelled 
from Wittenberg on Duke George's orders.

learning, Johann Greffendorf, ducal Saxon 
chamberlain, his! Friends in the Lord. 


Hail! | am glad, my dear Johannes, that you have so 
much insight into this bullosis. Certainly Duke Georg 
together with the bishop of Merseburg, extremely excited 
by black bile, will refrain from doing anything that can 
serve to ruin me and the university. In Erfurt, Eck ordered 
the university to enforce the bull, but they disregarded it 
because it had not been delivered to them in a lawful 
manner. There he was searched for by some armed 
students, but he did not show himself. It is said that he 
obtained the bull and his office as legate through tears, 
so that he would not return empty and without glory. The 
bull was printed in Erfurt and put up for sale, but the 
students tore it up and threw it into the water with the 
words: It is a bubble," it should float in the water. Since 
they were accused by the book buyer and demanded 
compensation from them, nothing happened to them, 
since the council turned a blind eye to all this. | hope that 
the bull brought a bubble (bullam), it is nothing else. |

as De Wette thinks, but a letter of the Pope to Elector Frederick, 
which the Duke received, since the Elector was absent in

To the godly and learned man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 
court preacher of the Saxon hero, his dearest 
[friend] in the Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail! | have received the bull which you sent, my dear 
Spalatin, and we are daily awaiting your happy return 
with many news and an old story, namely, that nothing 
can be hoped for from the court of Carl. | am glad that 
Hiitten has come forward, and God wished that he had 
written Marinus or Aleander 3). 

The ban by the bull (bullatica) is not feared by us, 
although we hear that these two bishops 4) will precede, 
whom again | will also receive quite nicely and adorn 
them with their due honors. Duke George, who is 
extremely furious with himself, is said to have been 
tamed a little from the outside. Our Philip Melanchthon 
answers under the name Faventinus Didymus to 
Thomas Rhadinus, 5) that is, the Emsian in disguise. 

Philip's wedding will be on the day after Catharine 
[Nov. 26]; the danger of evil tongues forces to hurry. 

The deceased D. Heinrich Schmiedberg 6) has 
bequeathed me a hundred guilders, which pleases me 
more for no reason than that the deceased righteous 
condemns the living wicked, as the wise man [Wis. 4, 
16.] says, and those have something to annoy them who 
have offered bowls and gold 7) to the ambitious Eck for 
the dishonor of the Word of God; for | have not given it

Luther wants, as requested, to defend the articles condemned

writing freely, or leave this to Luther. He asks for the titles of 
Fabian von Feilitzsch, to whom he wants to dedicate the writing. 
Luther's parents and sisters were at Melanchthon's wedding.

Martin Luther, August. 


No. 350. 


Wittenberg. December 1, 1580. 


To Fabian von Feilitzsch. 


Luther dedicates to him his writing Assertio omnium 
articulorum etc:. ("Grund und Ursach aller Artikel" 2c. St. Louis 
edition, vol. XV, 1476, no. 448. Compare the introduction there). 


This dedication is found only in the Latin editions because 
Feilitzsch died soon after the printing began. In the Wittenberg 
(1551), tom. Il, fol. 94; in the Jena (1566), tom. II, fol. 292; in the 
Erlanger, opp. var. arg., tom. V, p. 156; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 62; 
Hei De Wette, vol. |, p. 529 and in the Erl. Briefw., vol. Ill, p. 1. 
Walch seems to have overlooked this writing; we have not found 
it with him. 


1) Although Feilitzsch had died in the meantime, the dedication 
of the Assertio to him precedes the Latin editions because the first| 
sheets had already been printed. In the German editions it is 
omitted. See St. Louis edition, vol. XV, 1476, the introduction to} 
no. 448. 

2) "Die Mackenrodtin und die Kaufmannin." Seidemann in 
Sachs. Kirchen- und Schulblatt, 1857, sp. 76.

Louis Edition, Vol. XIX, 986. 





To the man distinguished by high nobility and 
godliness, Fabian Feilitzsch (Foelici), 4) German 
knight, his patron in the Lord, Martin Luther wishes 
salvation in Christ. 


What | have often testified before, Fabian Feilitzsch 
(Foelix),- yes, you most fortunate (foelicissime), that in 
the laity is the spirit that can judge and light a fire (that | 
speak with Isaiah sCap. 4, 4.), which you most certainly 
show and demonstrate, who have given a splendid 
sample of how you are able to judge and act purely, 
perceptively, godly and beneficially about everything 
concerning Christianity, when we, my Philip and |, were 
personally together with you in Eilenburg. 5) And | do not 
doubt that in this court there are very many who emulate 
you, so that | am full of joy, seeing the wonderful counsel 
and judgment of God, according to which He 
transgresses with the perverse and purifies with the pure 
[Ps. 18:27]. For since we, who belong to the spirituality 
(clero) of the Lord and should be teachers of the laity, 
have turned away and turned our backs on Christ and His 
Gospel, He measures us with the same measure and 
also turns His back on us, so that, just as we provoke Him 
in that which is not GOD [Deut. 32, 21], and in the word 
that is not the gospel, he again provokes us in such a way 
in those who are not clerics and in those who are not 
teachers, namely by communicating to the laity the pure 
knowledge of him, and leaving us our foolish and ungodly 
opinions. "Thou, O Lord, art righteous, and thy judgment 
is just" [Ps. 119, 137, Vulg.] 

Since | have written and said many things up to now, 
and do not know that the shepherds of Israel are so blind, 
| have not been able to earn anything but that they belittle 
me for what they should have loved me for, and do me 
evil for good [Ps. 109, 4. f.], until they go so far in their 
rage against their own salvation. 


4) Luther gave this form (felix == happy) to the name in order 
to use ihu to the word play that follows immediately: foelicissime 
(Allergliicklichster). 

5) See No. 346, especially the postscript.

said publicly that it would not be a difficult task for him, 
if he only wanted to steal Luther, and to deliver the 
stolen one into the hands of the pope. Be prudent, be 
an Argus. | don't know how many you make rich 
people: very many receive gold, not a few have been

from burning the Gospel of Christ in your books, or 
rather, Christ with the Gospel in a public place, what 
will they not dare to do against your person? A great 
sum of money has been laid out for the burned books: 
how now? not against the author? Against this place 
is a heavy hatred of the heavenly celestial bodies, by 
whose influence the people subject to them race in 
constant nonsense. The old memory of the tragedy of 
the venerable Capnio 1) comes back to my mind, 
whose spectator | was a year ago. Both the tongue 
and the pen would not suffice if | wanted to describe 
the nonsense of the theologians, whose emotions | 
have found more agitated than those of angry 
women. Oh, that the dark ones would come forward 
with their cunning suggestion, so that the fathers in 
darkness would be illuminated anew according to 
their merit, who neither want nor can be illuminated in 
any other way than with their own light, that is, which 
they receive from their heaven. But | hope they will 
come forth. But the Louvain have not sinned so much, 
because all that is their nonsense in this judgment 
has come from the Cologne and from Hoogstraten;

leniency in many things. The Cologne people sin

perished by Hutten's sword not far from Louvain the

and never give way to adversities. Of all of them, only 
Franz protects us most steadfastly, but he was almost 
forced to waver the other day by those who had 
persuaded him that you had written some terrible 
things; but | believe that you never wrote them. As 
soon as | learned this, | immediately considered it my 
duty to make every effort to ensure that so great a 
protection would not be taken away from us by our 
adversaries. | did this by reading your writings, of 
which he had hardly tasted very few before. At first, 
as soon as | had taught him as much as | could, the 
thing began to please him; shortly after, when he saw 
on what ground and what a work (molem) you had 
built, he said: "Some dare to destroy this, but,” if he 
dares, will he be able to? Gradually | have inflamed 
his mind more and more, so much so that | have now 
made him so devoted to us that he does not let any 
evening meal pass without hearing something of 
yours or mine. But he is a man of very keen judgment, 
and you would not find anyone more learned without 
having scientific education. Then, what eloquence he 
has; how does he take up any one thing, that he may 
elevate it and make it great! We could not find a better 
and more skillful assertor. And now there are people 
who continue to try to turn him away from us with 
great effort, but | know for sure that they will not be 
able to do so: | consider the man's loyalty to be so 
tried and tested. Yes, even when he was tempted a 
few days ago by some friends and relatives that he 
should leave the cause that was in such great doubt, 
he resisted most persistently, claiming that he was 
protecting a cause that was not at all doubtful, for it 
was the cause of Christ and of truth; moreover, it was 
the duty of the German community that our memories 
should be accepted, and also that the faith should be 
defended. However, dear Luther, | do not want it to 
remain hidden from you that he has caused me not to 
have done anything to this day; but with the intention 
that, if | held back longer, the cause would gain all the 
more favor, and the adversaries would become all the 
more insolent, thinking that | was defeated and 
crushed by the burden lying on me. | followed the 
memory of the friend. In the meantime, he also 
pleaded my cause with the emperor, who promised 
him that he would

myself unheard. Now we want to wait and see what 
will be decided in the next Diet (concilio). Everyone 
thinks that we will be negotiated, even with great 
strife. We will see what will happen. You remain firm 
and cling to the truth with a steady mind. But there is 
still little hope in the emperor, for he has large crowds 
of priests around him, and he is even subject to some 
of them; they all abuse his youth for advice that will 
never be of any use to him. But Francis’ efforts are 
reliable, even though he thinks that at this assembly 
of princes the emperor will finally realize what to think 
of the faithless popes. And some think that this time 
will be the beginning of a great hostility between the 
two, where Francis will do his duty. He is very capable 
with the emperor, but he is preparing to attack at the 
appropriate time. But enough of that.

Everyone who is seized with zeal for the evangelical 
truth should be outside the city walls at nine o'clock at the 
Holy Cross Church, where, according to ancient and 
apostolic custom, the ungodly books of the papal 
constitutions and scholastic theology are to be burned, 
because the audacity of the enemies of the gospel has 
progressed so far that they have burned the godly and 
evangelical books of Luther. ® Well then, you godly 5) 
studying youth, come together for this godly 5) and

Antichrist shall be revealed. 


4) The earlier verdict favorable to Reuchlin had been passed 
in Rome in the summer of 1520, and another had been passed in 
favor of Hoogstraten. Therefore, Sickingen invited him to the 
Ebernburg and Reuchlin accepted this invitation. But later he

The bishop of Augsburg would have taken action against 
him and others at Eck's instigation if the dukes of Bavaria 
had not stood up for him. This is how this restless man 
rages. He also writes that he heard from a credible man 
that the Parisian theologians considered all the articles 
condemned in the Bull to be entirely Christian, except for 
two which they considered disputable. We have heard the 
same from the Netherlands. May the Lord grant that it is 
and will be so!

also died suddenly in Hungary.

Three King's Days," that is, January 10. He was not yet 23 years

semicolon. The sense would thus be: Jener [Staupitz] has 
responded; | [Luther] do not know 2c. - Incidentally, as Walch 
notes, evellatur can mean both: "whether he will get away with it"

obstacle may have intervened that you have not received 
them long ago, since | have received two letters from you 
in the meantime, and there is no news of the ones | have

detailed letters | wrote to Hitten? | don't know what to do

Matthew Adrian asked for permission to leave, which 
we immediately gave him. Therefore, we are freed from

his successor. Moreover, it has been heard that our 
Prince will put a certain stranger in the place of the 
physician D. Peter Burkhard 4), although M. Augustin 
Schurs has long asked for it, and we for him; why is not 
rather one taken from our midst? Or, if our petitions could 
not obtain Augustin, it would be fair that D. Stephan Wild, 
the new son-in-law of the old Schésser, be put in his 
place. | say this so that you can suggest suitable persons 
from ours, if it should be necessary, and you can.

which you have requested. In Magdeburg, Emser's book 
is posted on the public scouring post with the title: Such 
a book is worthy of such a place. They add that it is 
accompanied by a rod, which should indicate his 
punishment. Incidentally, Emser rules in Leipzig and is 
able to do a lot and is subject to many things as one who 
soon wants to make an end with himself, as people of 
this kind are wont to do. 

During these carnival days, our young people led a 
masked pope around in a highly exalted manner and with 
great pomp. At last, in the marketplace, by the brook, 
they stood as if to throw him in. As he fled with the

in different parts of the city and pursued them according 
to a very witty and subtle plan. For the enemy

so late. The booklet that was issued by Confession 3) is 
being brought to you by the bookkeeper Schott. 

But see to it that you do not also believe those who 
accuse me of excessive bitterness in my writings. For 
they go about defiling my name, since they can do 
nothing else; but first of all | learn that they are such 
people who do not read, but follow what others say, and 
then are not accustomed to vices being bitten. | am

My book written for the confessors is of no use to the 
people of Merseburg and Meissen; they burn whole 
wagonloads of my books. That is how those wretched 
saints rage. That Rhadinus is Emser, you cannot yet talk 
me out of it, my dear Spalatin; we also have our reasons, 
but that | answer him is the friends', not my advice. | had 
despised him, the beast, but it seemed good to him that 
the fool must be answered.

addressed to me through the booklet. 5) The so-called 
Postillas, of which the Advent Epistles and Evangelia are 
finished, will go out in this Frankfurt fair, as a kind of 
foretaste, so that | can see what people think of this work. 

No less [than you] we are annoyed that those 
sentences 6) of Erasmus and the answers of our prince

Erasmus once wrote that there is nothing to be hoped 
for from Carl, who is besieged by Sophists and Papists. 
2) The Lord Himself is the author and protector of His 
word alone, but it pleases us that for the time being their 
raging is postponed by the counsel of God; when it 
breaks out, everyone prophesies that it will become a riot 
similar to the Bohemian one, which will also rage against 
our clergy. | am without blame, since | have striven for 
this, that the nobility of Germany did not set a measure 
for those Romans with the sword, but with advice and 
decrees (which they can easily do). -For waging war 
against the defenseless clergy is the same as waging 
war against women and children. 

But | fear that the rage of the Romans cannot be 
dampened by advice and decrees, and that this 
stubbornness in raging will bring misfortune upon itself.

The first printing has the title: Enarrationes Epistolarum et 
Evangeliorum, quas postillas vocant, in IV. dominicas aduentus,

1s According to your sense, this passage is translated in the 
same way in the old edition: "and thereby we become suspicious, 
as if we feared and boasted". The words: quae et nobis metu et 
jactantia suspectos faciunt would literally be translated like this: 
which also make [people] suspicious against us because of fear 
and boasting.

having conceived with a great fieriness, | shall give birth 
to a [glimmeuden] straw. | do not say of eloquence and 
of the daintiness of Latin speech. For as | am 
inexperienced in these things, so | do not work this at all 
for the high scholars, but for the sake of the common 
people, and for those who have breath in their noses, 
who are highly esteemed by God, as Isaiah [Cap. 2, 22] 
says. | have to fear their judgment, no matter how 
coarsely they speak, especially yours, most noble prince, 
since you are not only favorable to the holy Scriptures 
with incomparable zeal, but are also so knowledgeable 
that you could trouble every theologian, even the 
greatest, if you even begin to raise questions; so much is 
lacking that the Romans E. C. F. G. with the empty 
pretense and buffoonery of their bulls, or could ensnare 
them with their godless laws of superstition, while 
nowadays they completely deprive all bishops of sense 
and reason with this crude jugglery. 

But | will have done enough, if | have countered the 
unrhymed and ludicrous glosses of some people by 
bringing to light the quite pure and simple mind of the 
Gospel, and the people can at least hear the words of 
their God alone, purified from human dung, instead of 
fables and dreams. For apart from the purity and sincerity 
of the understanding of the Gospel, which is adapted to 
a lower capacity and that of the people, | promise 
nothing. But whether | have also fulfilled this, let others 
judge. But opinions and questions, which serve nothing 
for the matter, certainly no one will learn from me. 


Therefore, most noble prince, accept this service of 
mine, which is not to be valued according to your dignity, 
but according to your grace, and for the gospel of Christ, 
as you do, keep us long the Friederich, the godly, great 
Duke of Saxony, Churfiirsten, in the grace of Christ. E. 
C. F. G. be well in Christ. Amen. Wittenberg, in the year

"Entdecktes Staats-Cabinet" 2c, Jena 1714 ff, vol. VIII, p. 290. - 
There are many corrections in the concept. 


God wills it. By the Grace of God. Our greeting 
before, venerable, ecclesiastic and reverend, dear 
devotee! We graciously inform you that the Roman 
Emperor's Majesty has requested us. Majesty has 
requested us to provide you with an escort at her 
Majesty's request. We hereby send you a written 
escort to our brothers and our [principality] 1) officials, 
cities and other our subjects, [that they] 1) shall 
provide you and those who will be with you at the 
ends where our brother and we have to escort, with 
sufficient escort and assurance. His Imperial Majesty 
also sends you an escort. Maj. also sends you an 
escort and writes to you, as you will hear. 2) We do 
not wish to be gracious to you, for we are inclined to 
be gracious to you. Date from the Imperial Diet at 
Worms, on the 11th day of March, Anno Domini 1521. 


[To] D. Martinus. 3) 


1) Inserted by us. 

2) As Férstemann, "Neues Urkundenbuch", p. 64 notes, 
instead of this sentence: "It sends" 2c. in the Concept was 
originally written: "Your Mt. has also requested us to write to you 
in addition to your Mt. writing, which we therefore do not want to 
have omitted on your Mt. intentions, and where you will come on 
kais. Mt. request to come, as we consider inconvenient according 
to the opportunity of the things, but on your favor, so you want to 
have your thing on the way and in hostels with food and drink and 
otherwise everywhere in good care." This passage is deleted and 
the above is written in the margin. - In the same place, 
Férstemann erroneously says: "Walch erroneously gives March 
12 as the date," because Walch does not have this letter, but only 
the escort letter (the next number), to which this letter is the 
accompanying letter. Férstemann has considered these two 
documents to be identical and has given this letter the title: 
"Geleitsbrief fur Dr. Luther. However, the Geleitsbrief has the 
same date in the concept as this letter. See Burkhardt, p. 38, note 
f). 

3) We have taken this inscription from Férstemann 1. o. ; in

fact that De Wette notes: "This letter is not to be found in Walch"

in the 21st volume. Although this letter is also found in the St. 
Louis edition, vol. X, 1606, we have nevertheless translated it 
according to the original in the Erl. Briefw. newly translated. 


To the highly esteemed brother in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, the faithful servant of Christ in 
Schneeberg, his exceedingly dear [friend] in the 
Lord. 


JEsus. 

Hail! | have received your letter, dearest Nicolaus, by 
which you indicate that you have been appointed to the 
parish office in Zwickau 4), and you desire comfort from 
me. You know how dangerous these times are, and 


4) Since 1519 Hausmann had been a preacher (not yet a 
pastor) in Schneeberg, where he had a hard time with the pastor 
M. Wolfgang Krause, who was papal-minded. He accepted the 
call to Zwickau, where he was probably introduced on Pentecost 
(May 19) 1521. 


344 Letters from the year 

It is entirely that time of flight of which Christ prophesied 
[Matth. 24, 16, 20. For it is the time when they suffer not 
sound doctrine [2 Tim. 4:3], and wolves have become the 
shepherds [Acts 20:29], so that we have no consolation 
but to beseech the Lord that either we also may be able 
to flee, or to stand fast in these evil days. Every day | 
learn more and more how far and deep Satan reigns, so 
that | am afraid to take a close look at the shape of the 
church, indeed, so far has it come with my conviction that 
no one can be saved who does not, in life and in death, 
fight with all his might against the statutes and 
commandments of the pope and the bishops. This may 
be strange and new to you, but that is how it is, dearest 
Nicolaus. If you cannot grasp this, you will not be able to 
grasp my consolation either. We have found that the 
pope with his own is entirely an abomination of Christ [2 
Thess. 2:4], so that no one can preach but he who takes 
care to deprive him of the sheep and to cast him off as a 
wolf. You know with how great a clamor this offense is 
proclaimed nowadays as a schism, heresy and 
extraordinary evil; but what shall we do? There is no other 
way to be saved at this time of perdition. 

Therefore, my dear Nicolaus, since my counsel, if it is 
evil, must be most pernicious to the counselor, | leave it 
entirely to your free will, and let you act at your peril. If 
you accept the priesthood, you will make yourself the 
enemy of the pope and the bishops by contradicting their 
decrees; but if you do not contradict, you will be Christ's 
enemy. The supremely free faith of Christ cannot stand 
with their cords and deceits. In all these things | prescribe 
nothing to thee, but advise thee as | would be advised. It 
was up to you either not to desire my advice or to bear 
this advice | gave you in a godly and kind way. | have (I 
call God to witness) nothing else; in Him you are quite at

To an unnamed person. 


Luther is without concern for himself, and determined not to 
do the recantation at Worms that is demanded of him. 


From a very faulty copy of a letter found on the back of a letter 
from Seb. Dietrich's letter to the Ansbach chancellor Georg 
Vogler, dated Dec. 4, 1540, printed with Veesenmeyer's 
improvements in De Wette, Vol. I, p. 579 and in Erl. 
Veesenmeyer assumes that the letter was addressed to Joh. 
Lang, but Luther had written to him on March 6; therefore, the 
beginning of the letter does not fit him. (De Wette.) 


Hail! | do not write to you, my venerable father; it is 
your fault, since you sin twofold: first, because you too 
have written only once, then because you have sent no 
messenger to bring a letter to you; for where and from 
where else could |, who am hidden in this corner of the 
world, find a messenger? | write, and now | also beseech 
thee, that thou pray, not for me, but for the word of GOD 
with thine own. For | am not concerned for me, in whose 
still warm blood (it is strange to say) many thousands of 
murderers throughout the world have become guilty. 
And that most holy adversary of Christ, the supreme 
instigator and teacher of murderers, is laying all his 
might to destroy me, amen. Let the will of the Lord be 
done. My Christ will give me the spirit to despise these 
servants of Satan in life and to overcome them in death. 
You do not send money to your brother Peter, as he tells 
me; see that you provide for him. There is nothing new 
with us, and you wrote that all my things are sold with 
you. Then you hear from Worms sooner than | what is 
being negotiated about me. They are working to have 
me revoke many articles, but my revocation will be this 
one: Formerly | said that the pope was Christ's governor; 
now | recant it, and say, The pope is Christ's repugnant, 
and the devil's apostle. | am compelled to do this by the 
very wicked and blasphemous bull by which they 
evidently condemn Christ. Fare well in the Lord.

and content | have received submissively, namely from 
the good works of Christ and His sleeping. 

Now it is true, one ran in the Gospel not more than 
once that he had slept, which E. F. G. reports. But if one 
should have written all his sleep, what kind of a book 
would have become from it? It is enough that once the 
natural true humanity is indicated in the piece. He may 
have prayed, fasted, walked, preached, and performed 
miraculous signs more than once, as is clearly written in 
the Gospel: But some are written to teach us and to make 
us believers 2c. But that he has always done the Father's 
good pleasure is true; his eating, drinking, sleeping, all 
things, are pleasing to the Father, as the highest 
miraculous works. For the Father looks not at works, but 
at the will in works, as | have superfluously taught in the 
book of good works 4). It is not necessary to believe that 
Christ on the cross prayed the whole Psalm [Ps. 22]: 
Deus, Deus meus, rescipe, orally, but it is also not 
unchristian if someone believes this. All this is in the good 
free will of each one; for the Scripture says nothing about 
it, so others do not need to believe.

To the Imperial Council Joh. Cuspinianus in Vienna. 


Luther applies for Cuspinian's friendship at the instigation of 
the latter's brother, and gives news of his first interrogation before 
the imperial assembly in Worms. 


From the original allegedly in the imperial library in Vienna in 
Gleichen, Annal eccles., Dresden 1730, Vol. Ill, p. 823; in De 
Wette Vol. |, p. 587 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. ill, p. 128. 

To the highly famous and highly learned man, Mr. 
Cuspinianus," the Imperial Majesty's librarian at 
Vienna, his [friend] in the Lord, salvation 2c. 

Your love, highly famous Cuspinianus, has easily 
persuaded me that | dared to write to you in the midst of 
this unrest, since | previously, because of the fame of 
your name, wished to be exactly acquainted with you. 
Therefore, include me in the list of yours, so that | may’ 
test the truth of what your brother has praised to me with 
such a full mouth. 

At this hour | stood before the Emperor and his brother 
and the Roman Empire 2) and was asked whether | 
wanted to revoke my books. There | answered: the books 
are certainly mine; by the way, what | would decide in 
relation to the revocation, | would say tomorrow, since 
from me no more space and time for thinking over is' 
desired, and has been given to me from the other 3) side. 
But | will also not revoke even one tittle, so Chri 


1) Johann Cuspinian, actually SpieBhaymer, born 1473 at 
SpieBheim near Schweinfurt, died April 19, 1529 at Vienna; 
humanist and as such editor of a number of classics, physician, 
but especially diplomat and used for many legations. 

2) Here the text seems to us not to be in order. Instead of: ef 
fratre Romano should be read well: et fratre et imperio Romano. 
According to this we have translated. 

3) Here we have assumed ab altera parte instead of: parte, 
from which we could not derive any sense.

Luther reports that they were very worried that his 
whereabouts would become known, and hardly wanted to allow 
him to send the letter. He also admonishes to conceal him and 
to wait and see what God wants to do through his concealment.

doubtful or becomes doubtful whether it is friends or 
enemies who keep me safe, and keep quiet. For it is not 
necessary that others besides you and Amsdorf know 
anything, except that | am still alive. Who knows what 
God has done through this counsel of silence?

2) Buddeus, who brings this document from Luther's original, 
notes that it could only be read so far, the rest was so faded that 
no one was able to read it. He assumes that it is addressed to 
Spalatin and assigns it to the year 1522. According to its content, 
it must have been written to a Wittenberg, probably Melanchthon. 
It was not necessary to advise Spalatin to keep Luther's 
whereabouts secret. Apparently, it was written in the first days 
after Luther's arrival at the Wartburg; the following three numbers 
are from May 12.

Nicolaus Gerbel to Luther. 


Gerbet reports the various rumors about Luther's fate. He 
asks Luthern for news about it, also for the transmission of the 
writings he has published, and that he may soon complete the 
interpretations on Matthew. He sends greetings to Melanchthon, 
Carlstadt and Blaurer, and from Uringer, Otto Braunfels and 
Lucas Hackfurt (Bathodius). 


Printed in Jo. Fr. Hekel, Manipulus epistolarum etc., p.65; in 
part in Seckendorf, Hist. Luth., lib. |, p. 161, add. Ill (with the wrong 
date: May 26) and in Erl. Briefw., vol. ill, p. 159. 


Nicolaus Gerbel wishes salvation in Christ Jesus, 
the crucified, to the generous man, D. Martin 
Luther, the theologian, his extremely dear Lord 
and teacher. 


With respect to you, everything is so uncertain that 
you have never been able to see or hear anything 
more uncertain. For there is a constant rumor that you 
were attacked and captured, and then also killed by a 
sword being thrust into your neck. Some say that you 
returned safely to Wittenberg. Now one is in doubt 
which of these things is true. There is certainly no one 
among the learned or righteous people who would not 
wish the latter to be so. You cannot believe how the 
followers of the opposite party rejoice over the former, 
how they thank their gods. Truly, they are senseless 
people who do not know how much evil, even how 
much human blood your downfall would cost. Of 
course, we, all of us who have sought salvation and 
freedom and recognized that you are the champion of 
the gospel and the true faith, are of a completely 
different mind, and you do not believe how much we 
are concerned about your life. It is not that we envy 
you this glory, that you live with the heavenly ones, 
dead to the world, for which you have overcome with 
such sublime courage and with such unbelievable 
constancy these changeable events (rerum motus), 
but that you have been esteemed for treating with a 
few the gospel of Christ in the most correct manner, 
and under whose not deceptive 


354 Letters from the year 1521 


geric leadership, we drew hope that all that had been 
erased by the injustice and sloth of our ancestors 
could be restored. 

Therefore, my highly learned Luther, if you love 
me, if you love the others who still care for you and 
the Gospel of God with me, which has been preached 
by you with such great work, with such great care, 
with such great efforts, with so many dangers, then 
let us know whether you are alive or imprisoned, 
whether you are deprived of the freedom to write and 
to teach us, or how your affairs stand. If the rumor is 
true, then water and fire will be denied to all who read 
your books, who will believe that you have taught the 
truth. You now see what the future shape of things is, 
which must be held against those who have 
confessed the gospel of the Son of God. May God 
grant that in sincere and true faith we may not receive 
all the wiles, wiles and wiles of all our enemies other 
than that they are utterly null and void. 

By the way, | implore you, my dear Luther, in the 
name of our friendship, to send us secretly your 
books that have been published after your departure 
from Worms, if it can be done by any opportunity. But 
we all wish that the interpretations of the whole of 
Matthew, which you have begun, will be completed as 
soon as possible, for in these you can give us the 
most suitable form of the whole Christian doctrine. 

Greet my Philip in my name; | ask you to 
recommend me to him in the best way. My wife sends 
her regards. Greetings from the house of Caspar 
Uringer," who is the librarian of our council. Greetings 
from Otto Braunfels, the Carthusian. Greetings to 
Lucas, 2) the priest. Greet in my name Carlstadt and 
Thomas Blaurer, the excellent young man, and 
farewell. Strasbourg, 1521, the day before Pentecost 
[May 18].

A letter from a friend. While people assume that Luther is at 
the Wartburg, he is safe in his place: nobody thinks of Bohemia. 
About Duke George's wrath. About the riots in Erfurt.

ll, p. 8K; in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 30 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. Ill, p. 
202. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 744. 

Hail! | hear, my dear Spalatin, that the rumor is 
spreading that Luther is in Wartburg Castle (Wartpurg) 
near Eisenach; and this leads people to suspect that | am 
imprisoned there in the forest. But while they have such 
a suspicion, in the meantime | am safely hidden here, if 
only the brothers keep faith who are with me. If my 
published books should betray me, | will change the 
place. It is astonishing that no one thinks of Bohemia 
now. 

St. George, Duke of Saxony, is still very angry (iraxit), 
as | hear; it is well with him, and yet God wanted him to 
be angry as long as he is a pope. | will punish him as the 
Landgravine of Hesse, who is now the wife of Count von 
Solms, did; she knew how to answer such a great man 
properly, since she instructed her envoys [to say] that he 
should be mindful of his grandfather P[odiebrad] and his 
mother, P[odiebrad's] daughter. 4) Do you not know what 
she, the very perceptive woman, answered his envoys 
during the Diet of Worms? 


4) Duke George will have reproached the Landgravine Anna 
of Hesse, the widow of Landgrave Wilhelm II, who married Count 
Otto of Solms-Laubach in 1519, about this miss-marriage, 
whereupon she reminded him that he was of Bohemian descent, 
descended from the marriage of his father Albrecht with the 
daughter of Podiebrad, Zdena or Sidonia, which was also 
considered a miss-marriage. Compare the Table Talks of 
Cordatus, No. 772, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXIl, 1902.

surprised that the council of this city suffers this. | am well

Pray for me and be well. It is the will of our most noble

writings for printing and touches other printing matters.

His Georg Spalatin. 

Hail! From my landlord 2) | have received the talks 
and two quatrains of Carlstadt. 3) Dear God, do our 
Wittenbergers also want to give wives to the monks? But 
they will not force a woman on me! The author of the 
conversations did not have enough gifts, not enough 
erudition. And yet God wanted Carlstadt's writings to be 
more luminous, since there is a great abundance of 
understanding and scholarship in them. 

It is not my opinion that everything | send should be 
printed. Therefore, | would like the protective writing of 
Philip 4) to be postponed (if it should not please you 
otherwise) until the presses are unoccupied. The same 
should have been done with the Psalm Exsurgate 5) 
since there are plenty of such writings, which are 
necessary and urgent. 

| ask you, is my Magnificat 6) not yet finished? | am 
surprised that the 118th 7) Psalm, which | am sure | 
added at the end of the Sermon of Confession, has been 
lost in such a way that one part of it was in the same 
quatern with the last part [of the Scripture of Confession], 
so that necessarily the Sermon of Confession must also 
have been mutilated. The remaining part, however, | 
have especially sent with the other bundle; 8) perhaps 
you are not looking carefully. . What | send back here 
[from the Scripture) against Catharinus, 9) send to its 
place; for | have the same whole.

reasons for refutation against his book about the

confession. Luther sent it to Spalatin with the request that he 
have it copied and forwarded to the duke. If he deemed it worthy 
of printing, he should prefix it with the enclosed Zueignung (the 
following number). This interpretation was at the same time to be 
a sample of the German postilla.

To the Magister Spalatin's own hands. 

Hail! Since Prince John was attacked with the 
passage of Lucas about the ten lepers! that one must 
believe that those sent by the Lord to the priests teach 
confession, he demanded, when he was here in the 
place, through my host 2) that | should interpret this 
gospel, so that he would have something to answer 
these gray Pharisees 3) and hypocrites, who, as it were, 
want to forestall my booklet on confession 4) and strive 
to capture the prince's mind in advance through this 
gospel and turn it away, because they have heard that 
the sermon on confession is under the press. 

Therefore, | have had this interpretation 5) sent to you 
for the reason that you may see to it that it is carefully 
copied by a foreign and good hand, since you have a lot 
of such hands that have time for it, and my handwriting 
must be kept hidden; therefore, send my handwriting 
back to me, since | have no other copy, and it could not 
be given to anyone else to copy, so that | would not be 
betrayed. 

And although | have dealt with this passage in the 
booklet on confession, | have nevertheless so despised 
[the opponents’ interpretation] that a careful refutation 
seemed superfluous to me. 


2) Duke Johann will not have seen Luthern during his 
presence, since he sends his request through Berlepsch. 

3) This refers to the gray brethren (the Franciscans or clog- 
footed) at Weimar, who were fiercely hostile to Luther. Cf. St.

For | did not believe that anyone would be so limited tha’ 
he would seriously want to prove confession from this 
passage. That is why | have treated the passage carefull 
and abundantly here, and refuted its nonsense. If you 
should now judge that it should be printed, then prefac 
the preface which | have enclosed, attributed in my nam 
to anyone you want, either to Haugold (Hugbaldo 
Einsiedel, or to whom it seems good to you, only not to} 
the prince. The cause you see. For | would have it printed 
primarily so that it would help my sermon on confession, 
then, because it covers almost the summa of the Christian} 
being and amply exemplifies a godly life, so that the 
Germans would also get a foretaste of the postils. | would 
have added what Philip misses in this sermon, but |

for even Tiberius, when the heavens thundered, had 
himself crowned with the same against the fear of the 
thunderbolts 1): why then are you so afraid of the 
Salmonean thunderbolts of Emser, since you are adorned 
with laurels? Why are you not afraid of the inevitable 
thunderclaps of Christ [Marc. 8,38.]: "He who is ashamed 
of my words" 2c.? Since the seeress of Apollo, as itis read 
in Lycophron 2), had eaten the laurel, she received at the 
same time the divinity and the prophesying enthusiasm, 
and as the poet Says: XxXXxXxXXX XXXXXXXX XX

speech sprang from his mouth]. How happy the

hesitate? why are you silent?

military service under one who has brought such gifts to 
theological things, so much knowledge of things, who has 
studied natural things, since you have been engaged in 
the medical art for many years,°) who knows all the 
sayings of the philosophers like his fingernails. For | 
believe that those who consider philosophy and the 
knowledge of nature to be useless for theology are very, 
indeed, completely mistaken; for what else should our 
professorships serve us for?

give a lot to your judgment; but see that | may act with 
you as one says: He who admits the prefix of a good 
conclusion, cannot deny what follows from it. But that 
which follows from it is that which you now see in this 
monastery. For if it is contrary to the gospel to make sins 
from the use of food, place, person, time, and other 
things: where then will the vows, the monasteries, the 
rules, the statutes remain? For all these things are 
contrary to the gospel, and yet it is as true that it is 
contrary to the gospel to make sins in these things, as it 
is certain that the gospel is the gospel. What therefore 
wilt thou do? whom canst thou compel to obey? whom, 
having left, canst thou call back? whom canst thou 
accuse as an apostate, when thou shalt teach, as thou 
art guilty, that there is liberty here, and no sins? You may 
desire counsel from me; rather, you do not need my 
counsel. For | am sure that you will not do or suffer 
anything against the gospel, even if all monasteries 
would have to be destroyed. However, | am displeased 
with this departure from the gospel.

Capito wrote that he had another way of serving the Gospel

over again so that nothing decisive was done against the person 
of Luther and the Gospel. He encouraged his prince to read the 
Scriptures and some of Luther's books, which strengthened him 
in the truth. He excuses and glosses over the behavior of his lord.

Greetings! | have not written to you for a long time, 
firstly because | did not want to confront this course, 
which | would like to be as happy as possible; 
secondly, because | have adopted a way of promoting 
things that is different from yours, which you are 
certainly quite capable of asserting your position in 
open combat and displaying a fierceness of spirit that 
no one can resist. That is why | thought | could come} 
to your aid with mines. And indeed, something seems| 
to be in place. For Erasmus, who has a fine nose and 
a sharp mind, and who is very sympathetic to the 
affairs of our religion, although he has a different kind 
of judgment, publicly advised at Cologne 1) that | 
should see to it that the matter was postponed; victory 
lies in the recognition of the matter, which requires 
time. | have carefully followed this advice and have so 
far worked through my prince to ensure that nothing is 
decided against you too soon. What have | not tried in 
Cologne, what have | not endured?

being discussed whether to exterminate you, 
sometimes by hesitating, sometimes by advising 
something quite different, bring it about that the minds 
lof most decided in favor of postponing the matter. 
Although he has often gone astray by certain artifices, 
because he is a prince and inexperienced in the text 
lof the Holy Scriptures, he has nevertheless always 
lbeen brought back to the right path without much 
reluctance. But in the meantime, while | was with him,

without fruit, and even instilled in me the not at all vain 
hope that with him there would one day be something

studies 2) | have adopted a way of life that is foreign 





to my customs, so that | could thus remove the 
obstacles from the way for you who walk godly. And it 
did not turn out unhappily at all. For everyone who 
knows can testify to me how often the Cardinal of 
Mainz has stood on our side, how often he has 
aroused the displeasure of the Romans, yes, how 
often they in their writings have rebuked him in a 
hidden way, but me openly, as if he, influenced by me, 
was protecting them too indolently. | have - what 
should | hide it from you - acted cunningly, but godly, 
and used human diligence to promote the service of 
faith. By the way, in order to obtain such things, | have 
often promised my prince that no one of our order 
would be the least bit repugnant to him, that not all 
should accept with open hands the confession and the 
sincerity of his faith, if only he would continue to 
understand the purpose of the thing rightly and make 
an effort to express it in life, since much is at stake that 
no one should think that vain things are preferable to 
true ones. For in the meantime he has appeared as if 
he were too attached to ceremonies. 

On the other hand, | persuaded him and drove the

He has already had these things in his hands for eight

they promote his Christian judgment quite nicely. He 
has already had these things in his hands for eight 
days and is occupied with them; as far as | can see, 
he is beautifully encouraged in his Christian judgment 
by them. But after the return to Halle, he immediately, 
because he was not accustomed to what he had read, 
without my knowledge, | do not know what he did with 
regard to indulgences 1), which | had only learned 
late; but nevertheless | opposed it so that he was 
undoubtedly moved by remorse over his deed. Also, 
as far as | know, he has done nothing from that day 
on to get the indulgence going again, but rather, 
through reading and daily conversations, he draws 
more and more the light of truth, as he is by no means 
an ignorant man. | am happy about your letter. What | 
have already done, you now accomplish through this 
letter. His mind will be fortified, but | expect it to 
become exceedingly firm after he has become 
accustomed to stronger food, and nothing stands in 
the way of this except that he is a man, as he says, 
not inaccessible to flattery, because he is a born 
prince and a young man. | see that you have sought 
nothing else than that he should not retrieve the 
buried indulgence, lest he should deceive the people 
by his prestige. Therefore, you work very beautifully 
with me, and | thank you. Only | ask that you do not 
do something careless, that you do not heckle the one 
who continues well, that you do not deter the one who 
starts fine, but rather continues, by insults, that you do 
not miss something out of zeal and diligence, and give 
me at least some small things, if he has any, and 
exercise leniency against them for a while, as those 
that are to be improved next, if, | say, there will be 
hope that he will become better. How righteously he 
insists with me that the Christian sermons should be 
heard! By his command, the Gospel of Matthew is 
freely preached here from the day he stopped the 
indulgences. In his own words, he refused the monks 
who sought permission to preach against you, even 
though they were instructed to do so by papal bulls. 
In my absence, he said: "If you preach the gospel,

| will not be against them, but | will never be an inducer 
of those who speak of strife. Then, when they stopped 
in an impetuous way, he had me answer them in the 
same way, but a little later. Such things have happened 
innumerable times, of which the physician Stromer,® the 
godly and extremely devoted man, knows a good part. 
All this is proof to me that the cause of this error, if he 
still harbors one, is the insolence of the flatterers, whose 
enmity against the gospel | have to suffer, even though 
they cleverly pretend otherwise. But in the meantime 
such things occur, which | do not approve of. How now? 
Are we out of this world, that we want to wipe away all 
stains with impetuous remedies at once? One must 
close one's eyes to small things and direct one's mind to 
the truth, then what is wrong will fall away of its own 
accord. | therefore urgently request, even for the sake 
of Christ, that you handle the matter in and for itself, 
without reference either to me or to another, the prince, 
so that the one who has long since been attacked will 
have more strength left to resist. Consider the judgment 
of the common people, who have a disgust for the 
bravery and insolence in speech. *) You may also be 
moved by my danger if it seems to you that something 
must be added to friendship in this matter, since | have 
promised the prince all security with regard to you and 
have brought it about by the fact that something was not 
decided against you by the Germans until late, and then 
that the decision did not come to any force, so that your 
cause gained strength through void edicts. For it would 
have been full of danger if these people had fought the 
cause too spitefully by force sooner than it had become 
known to the people other than orally. Through 
trembling, your followers' courage grew and returned, 
which, as | had foreseen, would occur. This | write 
casually, as it were, no less sure of your faith than of 
your spirit, because | know that you will interpret 
everything for the best. For | seek nothing but the 
prosperity of the Gospel and the safety of my innocent 
prince, lest in the meantime a union of the great should 
finally come about, and, as hitherto in pretense, all 
freedom to write should now be seriously cut off, which 
| fear will happen,

will happen, not without the infinite shedding of 
Christian blood. If you now have something with my 
prince, you may communicate it privately to me and 
to him, and | will gently bring him back on the right 
path, for through reading he has become more 
compliant and is becoming more so day by day. 

With regard to married priests, many things are 
suspicious to me, and | fear such cases very much, 
as if they were festering, especially that those who 
have entered the marriage state with the consent of 
the people, after perhaps living badly with each other 
or having grown tired of the discomforts of the 
marriage state, might divorce again by force of their 
superiors, and therefore have not far-fetched excuses 
for their attitudes on both sides, which would provoke 
the people against us. If a few good and steady men 
would dare the matter first or otherwise see a suitable 
way, | would indeed hope more for success. But with 
regard to our priest in Vatterode 1) (Vaterrode) look at 
the matter like this: He took a certain whore, who had 
strayed from Switzerland, to live with him, and since 
he had a love affair with her, the Grasen, incited by a 
certain nobleman, who was very hostile to him, 
expelled him from their territory, where he resides. 
The man defended himself, saying that he had her as 
his wife and that it was wrong for any power to 
separate those who were bound by God. Soon they 
showed him to my prince that he should punish him 
as a pernicious innovator, and with such urgent words 
that they finally drove him to it against his will and in 
spite of his refusal. But now he has become free and 
is again applying for the priesthood, which | hope we 
will soon obtain for him under some good pretext 
(ingenio). Finally, so that | may fully reveal myself to 
you: if the prince does not increase in heart and spirit, 
then 


1) On July 2, 1521, Balthasar Zeiger from Oschatz (inscribed 
in 1503) had boldly defended himself in a letter against Hans von 
Trotte, Count Hoyer of Mansfeld's marshal, because of his 
marriage. Count Hoyer himself reported this to the Elector of 
Mainz, and Zeiger was thrown into prison until he recognized his 
error and offered to amend. Through the intercession of many 
pious people, he was released from prison, but had to swear a 
vow of reconciliation at Calbe on Nov. 4. The chancellor of the 
Elector, Laurentius Hoch, and Capito were present at the notarial 
execution of the vow. Zeiger, however, took his wife back and 
had to leave Mansfeld. Later (since 1523) we find him again as a 
preacher in Belgern. See Luther's letter to the Elector John of 
Sept. 10, 1527. 





Henceforth, there will be nothing to cause me to 
torture myself almost to death with this morose court 
life, and | will no longer serve him for four months, 
even if | serve this expectation as a desperate one for 
a little while. Yes, | will soon devote myself completely 
to the holy scriptures again, which | now only enjoy in 
passing, looking at them as it were through a veil. For 
itis not given to the heart that is weary with the turmoil 
of business to enjoy it fully and completely for 
consolation. Fare well and love us again in the bond 
of love; we desire no further favor; and answer 
through Melanchthon when he has time. Given at 
Halle, on the 20th of December, Anno 1521. 
Your devoted 
W. Fabricius Capito. 

Postscript. The prince has answered your letter; if 
he were a private citizen, he could not have done it 
more kindly or submissivelly. It will be up to us to show 
a not in the least insolent disposition, so that we do 
not appear to seek and excite battle in the attitude of 
a gladiator. | have said many things to Jonas that | 
thought were relevant to the matter. Your love will 
take it for the best and in the meantime try to answer 
us, so that | can help with all my power for the best. 
Fare well. On the day of St. Thomas [Dec. 21] Anno

Grace and peace in Christ! | have seen your letter, 
which you wrote to Amsdorf about Creuzen's 1) 
priesthood 2c., and | am very saddened, not so much for 
his sake as for yours, that you are so taken in by courtly 
sentiments and immersed in them, that you think and 
write so little Christianly about your brother. You say that 
you will henceforth be more careful and do not want to 
interfere with other people's inconstancy, and | do not 
know what great things, so that you have forced me to 
write this to you, certainly out of a brotherly heart.

| ask you to receive me with a brotherly heart for the sake 
of Christ. But if not, show it to me; and | shall be more 
dumb than a fish. 

If you consider the matter rightly, you know that man 
is not evil, then also that he is not guided in what he does 
in the change of the priesthood by recklessness nor 
inconstancy, but by the highest necessity and the power 
of conscience (which is the greatest in all creation), 
unless you do not know with how great tyranny and 
impiety such priesthoods are possessed and are to be 
possessed, and with what difficulty they are to be 
obtained. | confess that he obtained them before through 
us without knowing what he was applying for; now that 
he has recognized the matter and understood the 
danger, he jumps back and thinks of changing what you 
should approve, praise and extol with the greatest 
willingness; and you accuse and condemn him with such 
great impetuosity of mind that you promise that 
henceforth you will serve no one. Because you think and 
teach like this in the court, it would be better if you were 
eternally mute. Here comes to light what | always 
suspected at this court; now | understand why he 
rejected Pfaffenbeck so completely. 2) But there is 
hidden that secret evil of revenge and the ignorance of 
the long-suffering found in all of Christ and highly praised 
in all of Paul's letters, which is a slowness to take 
revenge, even if mau, provoked to it, would have just 
cause. Or do you think that this is not revenge, if you do 
no harm, but still deprive the brotherly service, so that he 
either cannot overcome the evil or cannot ward it off, 
which he could avoid through your help? My dear 
Spalatin, do not be mistaken: God cannot be mocked, 
not even by the court, however good a hypocrite it may 
be. For even you did not want anyone to do to you what 
you intend to do to this man, and you are now sinning 
against the whole law and love; lest | allow you to be lost 
in this sin, brotherly concern surely compels me to 
admonish you. Your glory is not fine! 


2I It was a matter of money matters in which Pfaffenbeck was 
in the right.

But (you say) the sacrilege and the inconstancy must 
be chastised, lest there be occasion for an evil example. 
Quite right; but first it must be seen whether it is 
wickedness or rather godliness that is to be chastised, 
lest there also be occasion for an evil example to punish 
innocence and godliness. But here godliness is at the 
bottom, because he does not dare to take upon himself 
and administer the ungodly nature of the masses. Now 
even if it is sacrilege, it must of course be chastised in 
such a way that it is chastised and corrected, not that it 
remains unchastised and the brother is abandoned in his 
misfortune. But if you carry on the matter here with such 
great severity, you will not only deprive the man of the 
priesthood, but also deliver him into the hands of his 
superiors (parentibus) to his greatest danger and 
utmost harm; in short, you will have ruined him. But thou, 
| beseech thee, wilt thou dare to call this a chastened 
sacrilege, who teachest the gospel? | do not expect such 
a thing from you. But suppose you could not do 
otherwise, for such is the custom of the court and the 
manner of the prince. | hear that; now what do you do as 
an evangelist at court? For you must work toward this 
with the word that this custom and such a manner is not 
there, or at least that it is there for you without an evil 
conscience, that is, that you denounce the sin of the 
wicked and save your soul, as Ezekiel Cap. 3, 19. You 
know with what powerful words you courtiers have so 
often punished my sharpness; but now see, | ask you 
what is to be thought of you, whether it is not more 
wholesome to treat ungodliness sharply, even with many 
people's annoyance, than to flatter it, so that peace and 
tranquility may be preserved. If then you are so patient 
in chastising the attitudes of the court, which are 
incomparably worse than even the inconstancy of this 
man, will you not be found to be one who judges 
unjustly? For | do not expect that you would thunder 
about the court or about a misstep of the prince as you 
thunder about the inconstancy of this man. Why then are 
you different against this one than against that one? Only 
because you do not have the 





You should not look at the person who serves you, but 
at the person. Therefore, either you must also receive 
this one with the patience and kindness with which you 
receive the missteps at court, or you should know that 
Christ has been rejected by you. 

O wretched people, who in such a way deceive 
ourselves with human pleasing and false appearances, 
and do not realize the secret omission of Christian love. 
The cause of the brethren we act coldly, even ungodly. 
Why is that? Because we treat it as if it were someone 
else's, not ours. But love, on the other hand, cares for 
what is foreign as for what is its own, as it is written [Gal. 
6:2], "Bear one another's burdens," and again [Phil. 2:4], 
"Look not every man on his own, but on the things of 
others." Love also chastises error, but does not abandon 
it. Certainly, this peculiar evil of this court has often 
annoyed me, that it does not harm those who have once 
given offense (in which it has the fame of not being 
bloodthirsty), but nevertheless rages so persistently by 
withdrawing help that it would be better to suffer a 
bloodthirsty man from time to time than one who 
withdraws. Whoever may praise this, | condemn it as 
contrary to Christian long-suffering. See to it, therefore, 
that you do not, by wriggling out of foreign inconstancy 
(carefully, as it seems to you), entangle yourself on the 
other side in foreign cruelty (carelessly, as it seems to 
me). 

God would have you receive this with a brotherly and 
grateful heart, that you may see how great and glorious 
a thing it is to instruct the wicked and to act upon the 
word of God, and how few there are who undertake this 
purely and freely. | therefore ask, if you can help this 
Creuzen (Creytz), that you not only not be offended, but 
also take care that the prince does not become too 
ungracious against him. Then, if it is possible, that he 
exchange this priestly position for another one in which 
it is not necessary to say mass. to say mass; but if you 
cannot, that you receive the man gently and graciously. 
For we are brothers, and he has done nothing wrong, but 
intends to act godly and Christian, wherein

accordingly. Fare well in the Lord, who enlightens and

Letters from the year 


To Nicolaus Hausmann, evangelist in Zwickau, his 

brother in Christ. 

Hail! This man, your messenger, my dear Nicolaus, 
has submitted to me in your name questions of funerals, 
of confessions, of sermons of the Minorites and their 
privileges (privilegiis). Above all, my advice is that you 
attack and fight all this with words alone, and let those cry 
out and blaspheme, deceiving and seducing those who 
deceive them. For this is what Christ and the apostles did: 
they let go those who could not keep them by word. By 
the way, it is the duty of the authorities to forbid those 
things which they do not like. And they are obliged to obey 
them for the sake of the common peace, to which all 
privileges must give way, yes, also help to it. They have 
nothing to say against it, since their mouths can be 
stopped up with the privileges by the gospel, since it says 
[Eph. 4:3. f], "Be diligent to keep the bond of peace." But 
since your part acts what is gospel, but their part pursues 
human things, they must give up theirs for the sake of 
peace. Now if they will not hear the Senate, let them shout 
and rave, and turn the people away from them as much 
as is possible, as Peter said in Acts, Cap. 2, 40: "Let these 
naughty people help you." 

About the innovation in other things | have written to 
you before, and now | write that you may follow our 
institution at Wittenberg if it pleases you; you will hear 
about it shortly. For we have made both forms free, but 
only for those who are worthy and stand in fear. 2)

We leave everything else to its use, and each one to his 
own mind. But we act by the word alone, teaching what 
the Gospel says about the Mass and Communion, and 
not forcing anyone to abstain from it or to celebrate it. Let 
the conscience of every one see to it that he keep himself 
according to the Gospel, until all grow and all become 
evangelical. For in this matter the people must be 
governed, not according to what the gospel contains, but 
according to how the gospel is apprehended; for not all 
apprehend the gospel, therefore not all can be governed 
in an evangelical manner. But all must be taught 
evangelically until all grasp it. In the meantime, others 
who do not yet grasp it must be carried. Greet Mayor 
Muhlpfort, and tell him in my name that he should stand 
by the Gospel. | would have written to him if | were not

Be mindful that the prince, since he is able, is obliged 
to help such people. For love prescribes such things, and 
makes us servants and debtors even to our enemies, as 
Paul confesses [Rom. 1:14] that he is a debtor both to the 
wise and to the unwise. For it is not enough "to do no 
wrong," but "to do well" is also required, and "to do him 
his right" not in a casual manner. 2)

This letter is found twice in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. 
IX, p. 189; in the Jena edition, namely (1586) vol. Il, p. 354 and 
(1553) vol. Ill, p.435.; in the Altenburger, vol. Il, p. 491; in the 
Leipziger, vol. XXII, p. 548; in Walch, vol. XXI, 33; in the Erlanger, 
vol. 53, p. 129 and in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 173. 


Favor and peace in Christo, Amen, and my most

Grace's mind is sincere not to do injustice to anyone. 
Again, | also know that no prince can be so pious, so 
wise, that he or his officials will not do someone a 
disservice. David was the core of all princes on earth, nor 
does he do wrong to poor Mephibosheth by showing off 
Ziba, yet he thinks he has not done wrong [2 Sam. 16, 1. 
ff]. A prince must consider that his rule is mixed with 
injustice, even he who has it least: therefore he also 
needs to show the more mercy and charity against it, so 
that the mercy against the judgment keeps the protection, 
as St. Jacob says [Cap. 2,13]. 

Therefore, | fall at the feet of your electorate. | 
therefore fall at your feet, and humbly beg your honorable 
Grace to have mercy on this poor man. Please have

To Georg Spalatin, ducal evangelist, his superior in 

the Lord. 

Hail! | wonder very much what Pfaffenheck's fault 
may be that he has made the prince so hard against him. 
| also suspect that perhaps my use of him was 
detrimental, that the prince wanted to make it known 
through this universal sign that my use of him was 
unpleasant. Therefore, you see to it that | find out about 
this. Henceforth | will not burden the prince with such 
scribblings, but not without his harm. For | do not want to 
drive anyone to good against his will; he does what he 
can answer for against God. | have another intercession 
for the pastor at Lochau, 2) who is seeking the parish at 
Herzberg, since he hopes to preach the gospel with 
greater fruit to a large crowd than to a few people. But | 
will not ask until you have written again. | have a natural 
abhorrence of the court, so this will not be an undesirable 
opportunity for me if | never have anything to do with it, 
even with writings. 

| have read the letter of the exceedingly clever 
apostate Minisch 3), and as much as | grieve over the 
lamentable fall of Jacob, | am indignant over the 
exceedingly godless hypocrisy of this man. 

| have suffered the new prophets, and Satan has 
been found to have shamed himself in his wisdom. Their 
spirit is very hopeful and impatient, since it cannot stand 
even friendly exhortations, but wants to be believed at 
the first word with complete certainty, also wants that no 
one disputes, nor resists. | 


2) Franz Gunther. He did not receive the parish of Herzberg, 
but remained in Lochau until the end of his life in 1528.

Since they were so obstinate, | also caught them in 
blatant lies, and since they tried to escape by miserable, 
slippery words, so that one could recognize the old 
serpent, | finally asked them to prove their doctrine by 
miracles, which boasted about and against the 
Scriptures. They refused the miracles, but threatened 
that | would finally be forced to believe them. At this, 
Magister Martin, 1) who had neither been asked nor 
asked to speak, foamed and raged, so that he did not 
leave room for me to speak either. When | dismissed 
them, | forbade their God that he should not do any 
miracles against the will of my God. Thus we parted. 

"Blessed are they that hear and keep the word of 
Goa" [Luc. 11, 28.), and, "If any man keep my word, he 
shall not die" 2c. [Jn. 8, 50.) This is absolutely said of 
faith, so that. "To keep" and "to hold" is not to do a work, 
but to firmly adhere to the word of promise, and to live 
and work in it. Christ certainly teaches faith, not works. 
Therefore, these passages 2) are quite without evidence 
for works, but very strong for faith, for the word of faith 
that is kept maintains that one does not see death. 
Herewith farewell and pray for me. Greetings to all of us.

Letters from the. Year 1522. no. 486. 





The first report on the existence and work of the Geschicht- und 
Alterthumforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes 2c, Altenburg 
(1842), p. 68; in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 30 and in Erl. 
Briefw., vol. Ill, p. 347. 


First of all, we confess and know that in temporal 
goods no one should interfere with another's, especially 
not in the rights or goods of the sovereigns. 

But when it comes to the doctrine and salvation of 
souls, no one is obligated to yield to another, to follow, to 
do, or to refrain from doing what is contrary to right 
doctrine. 

But now that we find our provost and pastors not only 
not teaching the gospel, but also refusing and 
persecuting it, we are moved by our own conscience to 
act and do what is necessary for our own and our 
neighbor's salvation, the city of Altenburg, as we are 
obliged to serve them out of two duties, namely, for the 
sake of physical rule and brotherly Christian love. 

Therefore we intend to have an evangelical preacher, 
want to and shall also be unhindered by it, even if an 
angel from heaven wants to prevent it, let alone that men 
on earth should hinder us. Therefore we do not want to 
enter into law or dispute with the provost in such a case, 
but freely, regardless of whom it deems unjust and 
complains about it. And we state our reason as follows: 

In the first place Christ says Matth. 7, 15: "Beware of 
false prophets, which come in sheep's clothing, and 
inwardly are ravening wolves. This saying is said to all 
Christians, universally and especially; from which we 
derive such power and right that, if we wanted to act 
Christianly, we should have appointed a Protestant 
preacher long ago, and, if we wanted to follow this right 
strictly, we should have expelled the provost and his 
people from Altenburg, as they are certainly found to be 
ravening wolves. 

Now let us do him the favor and let them stay, but still 
their wolfish sermon 


No. 484), presumably for the negotiations to be held on April 29 
with the commission appointed by the Elector, which consisted of 
Gunther von Binau auf Breitenhain, Michael von der StraBen, 
Geleitsmann zu Borna, and Jan von Wernstorf, Amtsverweser zu 
Altenburg. 





We do not suffer from our people, and we know that we 
do them no wrong in this, but too little right. But so far they 
have harmed our souls and taken the interest with all 
injustice. For St. Paul says 1 Cor. 5:13: Auferte malum 
ex vobis ipsis; modicum fermentum totam massam 
corrumpit [1 Cor. 5:6]. Now they are not only evil, but 
also harmful ravening wolves, which here St. Paul calls to 
be put away and chased away; which right we herewith 
do not want to forgive ourselves for tolerating them 
among us, but want to be content for a while that they 
keep quiet or preach the true gospel themselves. 

And whether they say that it is not our place to judge 
which is the gospel, or that it has not yet been decided by 
a council, we do not admit to them, for the Scriptures do 
not give authority to a council, but to every Christian to 
judge the doctrine, 1 Cor. 14:29.and to know and avoid 
the wolves, Matth. 7, 15. and do not stand on what other 
people conclude, even if they were angels, but on every 
man's conscience, for every man must believe for himself 
and know the difference between right and wrong 
doctrine, guia quicunquo crediderit, salvus erit Marc. 
16,16]. 

So the church and the space are ours, they have built 
nothing on it or in it; if they want to have their spiritual 
authority or district unharmed, we let it happen, provided 
that they leave the gospel and our souls' salvation 
unhindered and unharmed; if not, they violate their 
authority themselves. For the interest is not given to them 
to murder souls, but to preach the gospel; if they do not 
do this, we will not leave it to them, juxta illud: qui von 
laborat, von manducet [2 Thess. 3, 10]. We want to 
restrain our souls, not add money to them. 

Even so, their power is already taken from God 
Himself, where they strive against the gospel, because 
St. Paul 2 Cor. 13, 1) 10. says: There is no power given 
by God in Christianity to corrupt the people, but only to 
improve them. Now they only want

and have power to do so, our conscience and guilty love 
compels us to protect the people from the wolves and to 
warn them, q/uia] oportet Deo magl[is] obedire 
g[uam] hominibus [Apost. 5, 29 ]. 

Summa Summarum: if we are Christians, this matter 
may neither be right nor wrong. God has already judged 
it and pronounced the verdict Himself: Attendite a falsis 
prophetis et lupis rapacibus; itfem]: Expurgate 
vetus fermentum.... Therefore, we kindly offer the 
provost haec duo: 

Aut taceant et non praedicent nobis, omissis tam 
potestatibus g/uam] censibus; 

aut solum et purum Evangelion doceant, retentis 
tam potestatibus g[uam] censibus.... [Either they 
may be silent and not preach to us, and let go both the 
power and the interest; or they may teach the gospel 
alone and purely, and keep both the power and the 
interest.]

Eilenburg. May 5, 1522. 


To Spalatin. 
Luther reports on his trip to Zwickau and Eilenburg and 
wishes that the Elector request the council of the latter town to 


hire a Protestant preacher. Last of the counter-scripts that 
appeared.

Handwritten in Cod. Dessav. No. 114 and in Cod. Jen. a, fol. 140. 
Printed in Aurifaber, vol. Il, p. 61 d; in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 189

To the worthy man, Georg Spalatin, ducal evangelist, 
his friend in the Lord. . 

Hail! | do not know whether | received your letter, 
which you mention so often, nor do | remember what you 
wrote. But the bearer assures me that it was handed over 
to me; | will check on it in Wittenberg. By the way, what | 
have done with this journey, you will learn from others or 
have already learned. 

That Doctor of Cologne is called Gerhard, 1) from 


1) Gerhard Westerburg, born in Cologne at the end of the 15th 
century, matriculated in Cologne in 1514, studied jurisprudence 
around 1515 to 1517 in Bologna, where he became a true lawyer. 





a rich Cologne bourgeois family, a sincere man who 
came here to seek the truth and first fell into the 
teachings of the Zwickau prophets, from whose number 
he had provided a young man in Cologne with 
sustenance and had heard them, and even now (as a 
newcomer) he is very much moved by their dreams. But 
gradually he is gaining ground on the right path. 

At Zwickau, Thomas 2) had done monstrous things 
with his own. 

Egranus is still sowing strange things; Satan is raging 
everywhere and is persecuting the gospel. But Zwickau 
is now well supplied with three excellent men 3) who 
preach the gospel, with the pastor himself, a very good 
man, and two other priests who are masters. 

| see, however, that some Eilenburgers are tardy in 
appointing an evangelist, but others desire that our 
prince would exhort the council by letter that they yield to 
the poor people in this necessary and holy matter and 
either appoint Andreas Kaugsdorf* ) or a certain Thomas 
at Wittenberg. So you see that there is also an 
opportunity for your love here, if you could obtain such 
an admonition from the prince. For the prince, too, as a 
Christian brother, also because he is a prince, 5) is 
concerned that the wolves be fought off and that he be 
concerned for the salvation of his people. Therefore | 
commend this concern to you. Ge 


He apparently also became a doctor. Returning to Cologne, he 
became acquainted with an emissary of the Zwickau prophet Nic. 
Storch, then went to Wittenberg and there came into contact with 
the Zwickau prophets again. His life is eventful, as a Carlstadtian, 
as an instigator of the civil uprising in Frankfurt, Easter 152], as 
an Anabaptist, until he finally entered the community of the 
Reformed Church and is said to have died in East Frisia (at 
Neustadt-Gédens?) as a preacher (?) (15587). 

2) Coiner. 

3) Nic. Hausmann, pastor at the church of Unser Lieben 
Frauen, M. Joh. Zeidler, preacher at the same church (not Paul 
Lindenau, as Seidemann assumes in De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 675), 
and M. Wolfgang Zeuner, preacher at the church of St. Catharine. 

4) Kaugsdorf had been cathedral preacher in Magdeburg since 
1516, but after various persecutions he was removed from his 
office in September 1521 and expelled (compare Luther's letter 
to Capito of Jan. 17, 1522, St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 559), then 
through Luther's use he came to Eilenburg after Easter 1522,

| have received Catharinus 2) and the Venetian 
archbishop, who wrote against me, and finally it is good 
for Italy that it also has such people as Rubeus and 
Alveld are, so that not only the Germans would like to 
boast about such a great glory. They are not worth 
reading, let alone worth answering. A book of equal value 
was brought to me by Mr. Gerhard from Leipzig, namely 
a book by Hochstraten against me, in which, however, 
he did not mention his name, but by his style and manner 
shows himself as the donkey under the lion's skin shows 
himself by his ears. This we have delivered to the fire.

copies we are sending both to E. A. W. in special trust

previously advised us faithfully to the aforementioned 
Magister Gabriel, and we also heard him preach on 
the next Sunday [May 4], although without the will of 
the provost, so that he pleased us and the common 
city very well, we wanted to keep him with pleasure. 
However, because the matter is so poisonous for our 
most gracious Lord, we consider that, as we also 
diligently ask for it, as E. A. W. would, according to 
the occasion, want to excuse Mgr. Gabriel of such 
suspicion to his Lordship by a small document 8) and 
have such document delivered by this messenger,

be sent to his Lordship. G., as E. A. W. would like to 
note the reason for this, and E. A. W. out of Christian,

Also, most gracious Elector and Lord, we are today

whom Doctor Martinus has sent us with 


to the Elector, according to which the dispute over the unpaid 
interest was settled, but no settlement was reached for the sake 
of the preacher's chair. 

5) Here is a gap to be filled in this way. 

6) Supplemented by us. - In an undated letter written before

appointment of a preacher. To this letter he enclosed the note

The congregation is also requested by the 
congregation that they keep him on their own diet until 
the things have been discharged and put in order, and 
that they neither hinder nor prevent the provost from 
preaching in the usual hours, except that they may 1) 
outside of other offices, set up the churches for him 
after noon or without danger, so ardent and eager are 
they to hear the word of God. Therefore, we humbly 
ask Your Lordship to graciously grant this to the 
community and to us, because the Word of God, as 
mentioned above, should be free and unrestricted. 
This they will undoubtedly not refrain from doing in 
addition to us, E. C. G., in Christian love towards God, 
and to earn obedience, as we are obliged to do.

you will hear. Now we would like to grant them that 
the city would be provided with a skilled and good 
preacher. But that they indicate, as if Doctor Martinus 
had faithfully advised them to Magister Gabriel, we 
will report, how Doctor Martinus never had any 
pleasure in the same Gabriel's preaching, because 
he has introduced and aroused much error and 
displeasure in Eilenburg and in other places with his 
preaching and preaching. Therefore, we request that 
you summon two of the council of Altenburg before 
you and report this to them on our behalf, with the 
request that they renounce the same monk and speak 
out as may be appropriate. Then, when the matter 
between them and the provost reaches a conclusion, 
we would like to help them to get a skilled and learned

Hail! | am almost overwhelmed by reading letters; how 
much time do you think | have to waste answering them? 
About the passage Joh. 16,8. ff. hear my opinion. "The 
Spirit will punish the world for the sin of not believing in 
Christ," for the world did not know this sin of unbelief, and 
trusted and still trusts in works. But just as no sin is sin 
to him who believes, so no good work is sin to the 
unbeliever.

good work. "But for the righteousness that | go to the 
Father, and the world seeth me _ not." Of this 
righteousness also the world knows nothing, which 
consists in believing that Christ went up to heaven by his 
passion, and became the Lord over all things, that he 
might save all. For for this cause he is not seen, that he 
might be believed: and this is the righteousness of faith, 
not of works. "But for the judgment that the prince of the 
world is already judged." The world does not know this 
judgment either, since it is only concerned with what is 
good for the flesh and hates the cross; this is the wisdom 
of the old serpent poured into us. But the righteousness 
of faith teaches to love the cross, and to take hold of all 
that the prince of the world and the world itself flees and 
hates, as opprobrium, poverty, death, reviling. Therefore, 
the world is condemned and punished for adhering to this 
judgment of its prince and for resenting Christ for the sake 
of the cross. 

| am sending several letters of friends, in which you 
can read for yourself what you desire. In his collection 1) 
of letters, Erasmus finally reveals himself as a man who 
is wholeheartedly an enemy of Luther and his teachings, 
but lies with apparent and cunning words that he is his 
friend. In this way, he will do great harm to his reputation 
and his name. In this, Eck is better, who confesses to be 
an enemy without any disguise. But this sneak and 
deceitful man, who is sometimes a friend and sometimes 
an enemy, | detest. Christ lives and also despises the 
prince of this world and all who follow his judgment. 

Our Wenceslaus has another opinion concerning the 
passage Jn. 16, which | like; | will write it another time, if 
you want. Deun what | have said about the judgment, | 
myself do not like gauz, because | mean that the world is 
punished quite simply because of the last judgment, of 
which the world has not known that it will be, and for that 
reason it also has not feared, also does not care about 
sin and about justice, although it [the

Judgment] is so completely present that it has not only 
already begun, but even the head of this world is already 
judged. Through the revelation of the horror of this 
judgment, the Spirit wanted to inflame the world to the 
knowledge of sin and to the desire for righteousness, as 
that word Rom. 1, 18. says: "For the wrath of God from 
heaven is revealed in the gospel" 2c. Farewell and greet 
all our people. Your German word for eunuch is not 
enough for me; | have learned that in Westphalia it is 
called "a ron", and "ronen"” is to cut, especially the people;

[How | would like that you could obtain something for 
a certain poor farmer who was our forester 2) in Rehsen, 
and who was recently wounded in the thigh by a boar 
during a hunt that was commissioned by the prince, who 
became lame and unable to work, and who suffers from 
lack and poverty. However, he wishes to be helped with 
some grain so that he will have bread. | know that the 
princes receive these services and dangers from their 
subjects, but at the same time | also know that the princes 
should benefit their subjects, and that they often go too 
far in hunting and using people in this service; therefore,

To Paul Speratus in Iglau. 


Luther praises Speratus' sermon delivered in Vienna on 
January 12, 1522, and wishes to see it printed. He speaks out 
about the doctrine of the Pickards and the Bohemians on Holy 
Communion, and sends him the Scripture on vows.

Hans Weinreich. Reprinted in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 32

but translated into German by Speratus to precede his writing.

Salvation and peace in Christ! May the Lord Jesus

Vienna on the epistle Rom. 12, |. ff. and was zealous against the 
monastic vows. Already on Jan. 14, the theological faculty met 
and summoned him for Jan. 15 and again for Jan. 18. When he 
did not appear, his excommunication was publicly posted on Jan. 
20. Speratus had left Vienna to go to Germany, but had been 
detained as a preacher in Iglau in Moravia by the abbot of the 
Dominican monastery there. From here he wrote to the 
theologians in Vienna demanding to know why he was 
excommunicated and offering to recant if he were convicted of 
error. They replied that he should first send them the sermon, 
then they would deal with him further. He now sent this answer, 
along with his sermon delivered in Vienna, to Luther. 

1) From this passage it is clear that this postscript belongs to 
this letter. Compare the following number. 

2) Compare the previous number. 





Spirit, dear good friend Paule Sperate! Now at this time | 
am burdened with so much other and great business that 
| cannot answer you on all matters. But your booklet of 
the sermon held in Vienna has come under our judgment 
and verdict, and pleases us almost well, so we would not 
be displeased if you had it printed. 3) Also, in Wittenberg, 
we have sufficiently recognized the pride and arrogance 
of the Vienna sophists from their letter, which they sent 
to you. For | have investigated all things from them 
myself, but have not found that they consider the bread 
in the sacrament of the altar to be a mere signification of 
the body of Christ, and the wine alone to be a signification 
of the blood of Christ, but that they believe the bread to 
be truly and actually the body, and the wine to be truly 
and actually the blood of Christ, even though the same 
body and blood of Christ are in another form than they 
are in heaven, and in another form than Christ is in the 
spirits. So their opinion is not almost dissimilar to the 
truth, although | would like to see that people are not 
almost concerned about these things, but badly and 
simple-mindedly believe that the body and blood of Christ 
are truly present in the sacrament of the altar, and that 
we do not inquire further about how or in what form they 
are present, since Christ has not particularly told us about 
them. But you will be safest with them if you do not judge 
them until you have learned all things well. But the 
Bohemian articles, which you sent me along with the 
previous ones, are not at all to my liking, for they 
penetrate and bend the 6th chapter of St. John's on the 
sacrament. Johannis on the sacrament, since there only 
faith is dealt with. Neither the material nor the time will

Grace and peace in the Lord! Since | have nothing to 
write now, my dear Spalatin, | send and commend to you 
this petition of the poor pastor of Segren. Pfaffenbeck has 
again petitioned me with lamentable complaints that | 
should write to the prince on his behalf because of a

death of a certain woman, which he wishes to obtain and 
is confident that he can also be helped with it. But | see

Nicolaus Hausmann, the superior of the church at 
Zwickau in Christ. 

Grace and peace in Christ! My Nicolaus, who is highly 
esteemed in the Lord, to write to you among my many 
affairs in a few words about the matter you desire: It 
seems to me in no way advisable that the most noble 
prince be written about this matter, since | am certain that 
he will not accept it, but that he will push it away from 
himself and back to you anew. | know the kind of man 
who can suffer that whatever is done is done before 
others, but does not command or advise it. Therefore 
you, that is the council and you, must settle this matter, 
and for this you may, | ask, persuade the council in my 
name and by my request. But if the council does not want 
to get involved, then it is up to you alone, according to 
your office, to give the will either completely or as much 
as possible to the poverty of this person, your: that you 
do this and dare to do it, both necessity and love give you 
the right and power to do so. For it was not valid, nor is it 
valid now, that he bequeathed this for stones, since his 
brother exists, who must be fed from this money. 
Therefore, in God's name, go through it simply and 
without hesitation, and do not ask long or turn this matter 
here or there; finally, by some example, this ungodly 
custom of making wills must be broken. The other you will 
hear from him yourself, and greet the mayors in my 
name, and so

Report that the matter of the Altenburgs had been settled with

them the preacher suggested by Luther.

To the honorable and wise Henrico Oldenburg at 
Magdeburg on the Léscher Hofe, 7) my special, 
favorable, good friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ! That | have not answered 
you, my dear Heinrich, to the previous letters, is the 
reason: | did not know where from or where to, because 
there was no date in it; so | did not know you. But now 
that | have read in this last letter that it happened in 
Magdeburg, | give my answer. If the journeyman knew 
that the imperial mandate existed, he cannot swear that 
he did not know it. Likewise, if he recognizes and 
considers my teachings and books to be Christian and 
right, he cannot swear in any way to have or read them. 
But he can swear to do so, indeed, there is no need to 
swear, but he should leave it to himself to bring the books 
to those who do not want to have them. 


6) This letter has no year. Seidemann places it in the year 
1522, because Seckendorf, Hist. Luth. lib. |, p. 240 b, reports that 
Luther preached a sermon in the Augustinian monastery at 
Zerbst in that year; likewise Lingke in D. Martin Luthers 
merkwirdiger Reisegeschichte, p. 138. Furthermore, there is a 
report from the archbishop's councilors to the Cardinal, dated 
Halberstadt, May 17, 1522, in which it is reported that the 
magistrate had imprisoned a cleric who had been selling Martin's 
books and had delivered him to the archbishop's official for 
punishment.

and ordered the disciples to flee from the cities that 
would not receive them, even to throw the dust from their 
feet on them; just as the apostles left the Jews and went

them into Christ's kingdom, that is, to those who want

would mean] 1) swearing Christian love, faithfulness and 
service. But if they chase him away and prevent him from 
entering, he shall suffer and remain outside without all 
conspiring: so that he will not let the Christians in, unless 
he is forced to do so, and the doors will be closed in front

with such little books as and when he can. And comfort

Grace and peace in Christ! | send back the Hebrew 
dictionary, but the first one, which | once bought in Erfurt 
at the beginning, because | keep yours in my memory 
because of the many notes, although this one also 
contains some, which | do not like to miss; and you do not 
believe all of them, because sometimes | have guessed. 

| am about to write a letter to your church, but, held 
back by the amount of business, | have not yet gotten 
around to it, but finally want to put it into action. About the 
veneration of the saints (1 wonder about this) the whole 
world asks in such a way that | am forced to expose my 
judgment about it. For | would that this question were put 
out of the way, for no other reason than that it is not 
necessary, and, as Paul says [1 Tim. 1:4], will raise so 
many questions that have no end. And Satan deals with 
it, that he turns us away from faith and love by superfluous 
and unnecessary questions, and secretly sets up new 
sects and heresies, if one is not careful. Therefore, urge 
only what is useful, and call all to Christ, so that in the 
meantime they may learn that the veneration of the saints 
is not necessary, if we slacken, it is permitted and good. 
But it is foolish to take great pains in unnecessary things 
and neglect the necessary ones. The worship of the 
saints will fall away by itself when it is certain that it is not 
necessary and that Christ alone will be on Mount Tabor 
[Matth. 17,8]. For in this way 1) this service has fallen 
away from me, so that | do not know how and when | 
stopped calling on the saints in prayer, since | was 
satisfied with Christ and God the Father alone. Therefore, 
| cannot praise those who condemn with us the 
worshippers of the saints par excellence. For | should 
lead the weak slowly, and not suddenly turn them away 
from it, by first giving them an account of the fact that the 
service is not necessary, then also maintaining a reverent 
attitude towards the saints, of which my booklet will 
speak. It pleases me that also

answer: The best thing would be if you could persuade 
the people that you should keep the interest and 
completely abstain from the masses, as our priests do. 
But if they cannot yet be persuaded, it is safer to give up 
the interest as well. This would be a way out, of course, 
if you said mass as a communion, not as a Sacrifice or 
good work, until the weak were taught; but to do this for 
the sake of interest, and not out of pure freedom, is not 
advisable. For who could resist if someone wanted to 
communicate himself every day, when

the little questions, 


No. 512. 
(Wittenberg.) 


1) See No. 373 at the beginning. 
2s All issues offer here: Spreng instead of Iperensis. See No. 
475, the second note. Compare about Probst also No. 509. 


3) Haga Comitis == s' Graavenhaag, the Hague. There was 
the state prison where those accused of heresy were brought. 

4s Compare No. 475. 

5) For Speratus, see No. 493. 


6) The Cod. Solger, offers Herae Juliae_a Stauffen. It can 
hardly be doubted that Luther wrote so, because the name Julie 
returns towards the end of this letter. Here Aurifaber and him after 
De Wette has corrigirt the name in, but in the other place this 
improvement has omitted. Luther has made a mistake in the 
name. Argula von Staufen, born probably in 1492 at Ehrensels 
Castle in Bavaria, was married to Friedrich von Grumbach, but in 
the writings which she published for the Protestant doctrine, she 
did not call herself after the name of her husband, but Argula von 
Staufen. In 1530 she became a widow and died in 1554 in 
Zeilitzheim near Schweinfurt. 

7) Aurifaber and De Wette: Horlen. 

8) The Waldensians are the Bohemian brothers or Pickards. 
The questions had been presented to Speratus by Benedict 
Optatus, which Speratus, along with his own judgment, presented 
to Luther for decision through the envoys of the Brethren Unity, 
Joh. Roh and Michael Weif.

425 

The saints' service and what the saints perceive in 
heaven, his mockery, which we intend to meet as much 
as the Lord will lend. This is undoubtedly what happened 
to the Waldensian brothers. Therefore, do as follows: 
urge, persist, demand what is necessary, namely faith 
and love; if they do not take hold of these first, express 
your disgust at their frivolity, which is occupied with 
other, external and non-necessary things. For even the 
sacrament itself is not so necessary that faith and love 
should be put aside for its sake. It is foolish to quarrel 
about these minor things and at the same time neglect 
these precious and wholesome things. 

However, lest they think that no answer can be given 
to impudent and foolish men, | would say thus: It is free 
to worship and call upon Christ under the sacrament, 1) 
for he does not sin who does not worship, nor does he 
sin who worships. Here must be the end of this 
controversy, and you must not allow either of them to be 
forced and pressed, and let no one cite foreskin or 
circumcision, nor let them judge one another here. 
Therefore despise thou, and by despising reject such a 
dispute in this matter. If faith and love are there, there 
can be no sin here, either by worshipping or by not 
worshipping; but if faith and love are not there, everyone 
will sin forever, whether he worships or not, yes, he will 
sin forever throughout his life. For faith worships in such 
a way that it imagines Him alone, of whom it has no 
doubt that His body and blood are there. If those 
quarrelsome people do not want to call this 
concomitance, let them call it something else, and stop 
quarreling, since they agree on the matter itself. For no 
one denies, | mean, not even the brothers themselves, 
that the body and blood are there. 


1) Here, the Erl. Briefw., which we have followed, according 
to the Cod. Solger: Tamen ne importunis et stultis 
non posse responderi putent, sic dicerem: liberum 
est, Christum adorare et invocare etc. Against this offer 
Aurifaber and De Wette: Tamen ne importunum responsum dem 
stultis, ne putent me non posse respondere, sic dico: liberum 
esse, Christum adorari et invocari etc.. 





The blood of Christ is there to be worshipped. It is 
enough that this is called concomitance. But those who 
want to find out how the divinity is grasped there in 
concomitant, punish them as those who in foolish 
presumption and with carnal imaginations fall upon the 
mysteries of God, so that you may keep them in 
simplicity of faith and the pure knowledge of the 
sacrament. For where such foolish and unnecessary 
imaginations are allowed, they will make rash people, 
and with the setting aside of faith will bring back that 
whole mud pit of place, of the infinite, of empty space, of 
greatness, of essence, and everything that has so far 
fooled natural reason and philosophy, therefore one 
must be vigilant here that simplicity be preserved. Again, 
faith and love does not worship, because it knows that it 
is not commanded to worship, and that one does not sin 
by not worshipping. Thus he passes freely through the 
midst of them, and tolerates them all, letting each one 
have his own way. He only forbids that they should not 
quarrel and that one should judge the other, for he hates 
sects and divisions, but lets everything be free. 

So also this dispute is to be laid to rest, whether under 
the bread alone the body is by the power of the words 
2c. For what need is there, as you yourself have judged, 
to involve the coarse people in these quibbles, who 
meanwhile can be led by this sound and sure faith, 
namely, that they believe that under the bread is the body 
of him who is true God and true man. But as there are 
concomitant blood, humanity, divinity, hair, bone and 
skin, what need is there that we should trouble ourselves 
about these things, since it is not necessary that they 
should be known? Faith is neither taught nor increased 
by these things, but doubt and discord are sown. Faith 
does not want to know more than that under the bread is 
the body of Christ, under the wine the blood of Christ, 
who lives and reigns; in this simplicity it persists and 
despises impertinent questions. 

So | would also answer that of the worship and 
invocation of GOD, who is in the 


426 427 


Letters from the year 1522. no. 512. 513. - 


He is free and neither of them is necessary. But it is not as faith alone consecrates, and that priests are often without 
certain with most people that he dwells in them as it ig faith while they consecrate, where necessarily the words 
certain that he is under the sacrament. But we read in 44"e not only spoken in jest and deceitfully, but also in 


Cor. 14:25 that the apostle says that the unbeliever woul 
fall on his face and worship God in the saints if he ha 
heard them prophesying. And Abraham saw three angel 
and worshipped the One Lord. And what do we do whe 
we precede one another in reverence (this is the exampl 
you use), but to honor and worship God in ourselves4 
Therefore it shall be free to call upon GOD, whether in 
man or apart from man, in the creature or apart from th 
creature, for, "I fill heaven and earth, saith the LORD" [Jer 
23:24]. Here faith walks quite securely, which in all alon 
honors GOD; but to the unbelievers it cannot be sufficient! 
said, reproached, and proved that they always worshi 
themselves. Therefore, as | have said, teach only that the 
should be sound in faith, and such questions will not b 
necessary, and the anointing will instruct them by itself i 
all things, without which we do nothing but fall int 
questions that have no end. 

Greetings in my name to Martin Novilianus, 1) and wis 
him much salvation in Christ. | have written to Mrs. Julie 2 
but very briefly. The booklets of the vows have long bee 
out of print; we have ordered that they be printed anew 
We have arranged for the bearers to see to it that what w 
have is sent to you. You are well in Christ and pray for me 
Friday after Pentecost [June 13] 1522. 

As | was about to close this letter and was lookin 
through yours again to see whether | had satisfied al 
things, | came across a small note in which you ask abou 


impiety. Therefore, in order to be sure, we must learn in 
every way that they also consecrate, and nevertheless 
such an unbelieving priest must nevertheless consecrate 
as a minister in the faith of the Church, since he 
consecrates by command and authority of the Church. 
For it is not he who speaks the words, but the church; but 
he is the minister of the words spoken by the church, as 
you can easily gather from this. Again, be well.

In a letter, Sturm reminded Luther of his earlier acquaintance 
with him and expressed his surprise that he was so harsh in his 
criticism and scolding of the great. Luther replied that he had long 
used patience and humility, but in vain; now, following the 
example of Christ and the prophets, he used severity.

Letters from the year 


But that you do not understand why | attack and 
rebuke the high chiefs and prelates so harshly, calling 
them fools and asses, when Christ teaches everywhere 
that one should be patient, | answer: | have shown my 
patience and humility too much. | have pleaded and 
begged; | have now followed them three times 1) and 
have always offered myself humbly, as all the world 
knows. Now that some worldly wise men do not want to 
look at my humble pleading and humility to improve 
themselves, but take only that, because | am hard and 
serious, and are angry about it: They are like the 
stubborn Pharisees, who abandoned all the kindness 
and mercy of our Lord Christ, and did not improve 
themselves, but where he called them vipers, blind fools, 
children of devils, adulterers, and the like, they fasted 
and were angry. If you read the 24th [23rd] Cap. 
Matthew, you will see how Christ calls them blind fools. 

Until now, we have been accustomed to praise and 
flatter the prelates while the gospel lay under the pew. 
But now it comes out, and punishes the high heads as 
fools and blind men, it seems strange to us. Violence and 
injustice should be suffered by everyone; this | have 
done, and still do; but a preacher should not be silent 
about it, but as Isaiah says in the 58th chapter, lift up his 
voice and tell the prelates their sin, mischievousness, 
and malice 2c. This is what the prophets, apostles, and 
Christ himself did, even though they willingly endured all 
kinds of suffering. There is a great difference between 
being patient and keeping silent about the wickedness of 
the prelates. Silence is no good; one must suffer, punish 
and rebuke; but one must also love and do good. A father 
scolds, punishes and chastises his child, and yet is not 
hostile to him; but he is hostile to him who keeps silent 
about his wickedness, and neither scolds nor chastises. 
Hereby | command you to God. Given at Wittenberg,

Grace and peace in Christ, amen. That there are 
people among you who resist the gospel and tear people 
away from it by force and cunning, you need not be 
surprised at this if you believe that the gospel is in truth 
the gospel. For "with wicked men it grows worse the 
longer, deceiving and being deceived," says Paul [2 Tim. 
3:13.]. You know that Usingen's head is so hardened by 
ingrained obstinacy and the high opinion he has of 
himself that it is harder than a demant. Therefore, his 
nonsense must be taught against in such a way that his 
completely unlearned and blind pomposity is despised. 
For so he is accustomed from youth to soften no one. 
Therefore there is no hope that he will give way to Christ, 
since he has already been trained and prepared for 
hardness by long practice and art. Let him go, that he 
may confirm the proverb, in which it is said: "Age does 
not help any foolishness", and he is dependent on the 
violence of old age and childishness. By the way, my 
opinion is that it is free to keep the judicial and ceremonial 
precepts of Moses, as Philip also teaches in his /ocis. 2) 
It is not necessary that adulterers be stoned, 2c. which

Duke Carl von Munsterberg to Luther. 


He wants Luther to publish a scripture or scriptures in which it 
is clearly stated that the Lord's Supper should be partaken of 
according to Christ's order in both forms, so that the honor of his 
ancestor George Podiebrad, King of Bohemia, who had been 
banished by the pope for this reason, may be restored.

Eisleben, but was later removed); in the Altenburg edition, vol. Il, 
p. 186; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XVIII, p. 317; in Walch, vol. XX], 
123* and in Erl. Briefw., vol. Ill, p. 408. All these editions are 
based on the Wittenberg. 


By the Grace of God Carl, Prince of the Holy 
Roman Empire, Duke of Munsterberg in Silesia, 
zur Olsen, Count of Glatz, Lord of Kunstadt and 
Podiebrad 2c., Governor of the Margraviate of 
Upper Lusatia. 

Worthy and devout Father! Among other of your 
Christian writings and doctrines, we have not 
considered one of the least, but the most important 
pieces, according to the holy Gospel, to receive and 
eat the holy testament of our Savior Christ in its 
entirety, as under both forms, and _ although, 
according to our little understanding, even before this 
time, we have always followed the word of Christ 
more faithfully than the seduction of the papal see: 
Nevertheless, for the sake of the high title, name and 
authority of papal holiness, we have been 
fainthearted in this, and with others without light, until 
through you the truth of our Savior Christ has been 
brought to light, his gospel has been brought forth, 
and the papist pomp has been replaced with 
evangelical doctrine, by which we have gained 
courage, consolation and strength, and thus return to 
our intended opinion. 

And that you, Christian father, may recognize and 
hear the grievance of our hearts, we do not want to 
plead with you in a splendid manner or after the 
exercise of princely status, but as with our brother, 
with this avoidance: that the most illustrious prince, 
King George of Bohemia, of laudable memory, our 
dear lord and ancestor, for this reason alone, that 
according to the noble word of Christ he confessed to 
receive his holy testament in its entirety, under both 
forms, and thus also remained in the same custom 
until his mortal departure, from the papal chair to the

The fourth generation is still being proclaimed a chief 
heretic by the same one, who prides himself as a 
governor of Christ, with the Bulla Coenae Domini. If 
we now come to the rightly recognized truth that also 
the House of Muinsterberg has had to endure such a 
calamity against God, honor and right for such a long 
time, we want you, devout father, to take it to heart. 

And that is even more, the pope has taken away 
not the least part from our highly thought lord and 
ancestor, King George, with banishment and 
renunciation of their oaths and duties, and what 
misfortune has resulted from this for many is evident 
and disgraceful; consider it well, worthy father, that 
you, as you have experience of much such history 
that has occurred, also have good knowledge of it. 

Therefore, for the honor of Christ, for the 
preservation of His holy word, for the comfort of our 
consciences, for the dampening of the evil of the 
House of Minsterberg, and for the protection of our 
and our heirs' princely dignity, we have placed our 
eager desire on you, also asking you to take this 
Christian, and on the other hand the papal business, 
as it is briefly described here, to your Christian mind, 
to clarify it and to deny it with your writings, and let it 
come to light, if your oath and duty, with which you 
adhere to the holy Scriptures, require and demand 
this in addition to the Gospel, 1) so that this evil 
delusion of our Lord and ancestor may be set aside 
among the common people by such evangelical 
guidance, and so that we and our heirs will have to 
resist the papist malediction and proclamation in our 
hearts all the more comfortingly and courageously, 
without biting consciences. 

Only our opinion would be that our person would 
not be reported in your writings, if you would let it go 
out as if it had happened from our incitement, 2) for 
the sake of moving causes 3) which we would like to 
tell afterwards, where the Almighty God wants to 
send our meeting, to which we aspire, are inclined 
and hotly eager. 

And how much we like your person, as now then 


1) "erheischen" is Conjectur des Erl. Briefw. for: "promise". 

2) "would" put by us instead of: "would". 

3) These moving causes are obviously the considerations 
imposed on him by his position against King Louis of Bohemia, 
who a few months earlier, on Christmas Eve 1521, had issued a 
strict mandate to the Silesian estates not to let the Lutheran 
doctrine take root, but to eradicate it. 





4) but we are of the understanding and constant faith 
that you will show and prove your Christian love, 
faithfulness, and dutiful service, in honor of Christ and 
His Word, and for the refreshment of our conscience, 
5) in such a way that we may assume that this request 
of ours, which is just and proper, has not sprouted 
unfruitfully, but has actually taken place and been 
preserved. 

With this we have faithfully committed ourselves to 
your prayers, especially that the merciful God may 
give all authorities the right understanding and sense 
to keep and use their temporal government in peace 
and harmony for the blessedness of common 
Christendom. Given at our castle at) Olsen, on June

penetration of Lutheranism into his country and took part in the

certain ostentation. His main concern was to help the soul of his

To the Bohemian Estates. 


Luther exhorts the Bohemians to stick to their faith and not t 
reconcile with the papal see, hoping that the Germans and th 
Bohemians will unite in doctrine. 


The rumor has spread among us, as if some of you 
should dare to be concerned that the Bohemians should 
fall again to the harmful chair of Roman tyranny, and that 
this reason should be put forward, as if the Bohemians 
might otherwise have no lasting peace for eternity. It is 
true that before this time | was almost disinclined to the 
Bohemians, before | knew that the Pope is the true 
Antichrist; but now, in the meantime, Christ, our dear 
Lord, has graciously and abundantly let his blessed word 
shine again to us in this terrible last time, | well believe 
that Your Grace and Esteem have heard that the 
Bohemians are at peace, Your Reverence and 
Respectability have heard that | have praised your 
disobedience to the Popes in such a way that none of you 
has ever borne the hatred of your name with so much 
difficulty as | have. For how often am | scolded, even 
today, as if | had been born a Bohemian, or had dared to 
flee to Bohemia! And indeed, | would have come to 
Bohemia once 2) not for the sake of escape, but out of 
eagerness to scare you and to learn your faith; but | did

all things will not soon be changed in one hui, nor with 
painting. But let us deal carefully with your people, 
faithfully preside over them through godly, pious| 
preachers, lead them only to the Lord Christ, and forgive 
and pardon one another from the heart, and, as they say, 
do not demand everything at once, nor seek it most 
carefully. 

If there are still sects and cults among you, let it be so; 
we know well that it cannot be as pure as it ought to be. 
Therefore St. Paul speaks not without cause 1 Corinthians) 
11:19: "There must be sects among you" 2c. But if you 
think that you will come to the Roman See by such 
acclamation, so that Bohemia may not be further divided 
into sects, 1) that will certainly not happen by this means. 
Are there not discord and sects among us Germans and 
everywhere else where the pope's tyranny reigns? The 
mendicant monks alone are divided and torn into seven 
sects; the barefooted are also divided into seven different 
barefoots. And over all these sects the most holy father in 
Rome holds with all his might and defends them, because 
he is afraid that they will become one. With the same care 
he is also concerned that secular kings and princes be 
and remain at odds with one another; for his rule can exist 
by no better means than by discord between spiritual and 
secular prelates or great lords. Therefore, the Bohemians’ 
discord in faith may not be compared or united with the 
sects in the papacy by such a way or means (to go to the 
pope). 

Therefore, Your Grace, Reverence and respectability’ 
may well take care that they do not get out of bad little 
sects, which can be helped, into sects again, which St, 
Peter calls pernicious sects [2 Petr. 2, 1.From which the 
right of the Lord has graciously delivered you long ago 
and we are in daily work to work ourselves out of them 
also by His grace and help; we have also, praise God] 
begun blessedly. Therefore the Sects 


1) "may" put by us instead of: "like", according to the Latin. 








by no means can they be stopped, except, as | said, when 
godly pastors and preachers purely teach and spread the 
gospel, which is a word of peace and grace; this alone 
makes a people of one accord, and it is Christ alone who 
by this makes people of one accord dwell in the house of 
the Lord [Ps. 133:1]. 

If, however, the people may not be able to refrain from 
such a coincidence with the Roman See, | ask that Your 
Grace and respectability let me keep this with you, Your 
honor and respectability will let me keep this with you, 
that you confidently sit down against the wretched 
blasphemous chair at Rome, to keep both forms of the 
holy sacrament, also that you do not condemn the 
innocent blood of your blessed John Hus and Jerome of 
Praga together with their doctrine; for these two articles 
the blasphemous chair, the drunken whore of the holy 
blood, will earnestly require and want to keep from you. 
Neither will he accept you, nor may he accept you, 
without the injury of his tyranny, for you swear to the 
above two articles. But all those who will swear shall 
know, by my testimony before God and the world, that 
they swear by the Lord Christ, and are children of 
perdition and eternal damnation. Truly, | and ours want to 
defend John Hus, the holy martyr of Christ, and even if 
all of Bohemia, since God is for it, has denied his 
teachings, he shall still be ours. 

Therefore, | ask Your Grace, Reverend and 
Esteemed Sirs, briefly this time (at another time | will, if 
God wills, write more and further), that you will stand firm 
and persevere in the disobedience of the devil, as you 
have so far remained steadfast through many tribulations 
that you have endured over it, and that you will not do our 
Gospel, which, praise God, is now flourishing again, any 
harm by your apostasy. Further, do not be deceived by 
this, although not all things are as they should be with 
you. If you are now Galatians, God can raise up some 
Paul who will restore you and make well that which is now 
sick. But do not fall away, that is, do not submit to the 
godless Roman tyranny. 


440 


Lastly, | beseech the Lord Jesus Christ that he may 
graciously continue and prosper, that your hearts may be 
enlightened and led into all the perfection of the grace 
and knowledge of Christ, who is blessed and blessed for 
ever and ever, amen. Your Grace, Honorable and 
Respected One, please accept my thoughtless letter in 
Christ. Given at Wittenberg, on the 10th day of July in the

To the worthy man, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, bishop 
of the church at Zwickau, his superior who is to be 
highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace from God! | wish, my dear Nicolaus, 
if it were possible, that you rather examine the coming 
bishop-god over the faith, since these unfortunate people 
are twofold children in the faith and in the knowledge of 
Christ. For | would like that this game and the lie of the 
Sacrament of Confirmation should be completely talked 
out of the people, because it is written [Jer. 29, 31]: "They 
have made my people trust in lies. Rather, they may say 
[to us]: Where are those promises and marks proclaimed 
in the Scriptures, which the godless bishop 1) boasts of 
in this wicked note? If they are not proclaimed, what is 
the use of allowing the people to be mocked with lying 
promises and fictitious marks? Surely it will behoove you 
to address the coming bishop about these things, and to 
"resist him to the face for the people of Christ, as Paul 
resisted Peter," and to demand that he prove with 
Scripture what he is about to do. If he will not or cannot 
do this, you will exhort the people not to trust in the 
comedy of this confirmation. Immediately after | saw your, 
note, | had this other one 2) printed against the degrees 
invented by these wicked monsters. Farewell and greet 
all of us in the Lord. On the third of August 1522.

date we have set is based on the following consideration: That 
Luther had sent the writing to Hausmann on August 3, we see 
from the preceding letter. However, given the urgency of the 
matter, this will probably have happened on the very day that the

He must be a man with whom it is easy to do what is 
Christian and right, and who is also fond of learned 
people. Now his Princely Grace cannot resist this cause. 
It must also strive against God, who, through Saint Paul 
in 1 Timothy 4, v. 3, has so publicly left the marriage state 
free and condemned the prohibitionists. If it would not be 
too difficult for Our Lady, | humbly ask her to do a 
Christian work in this matter and to help that the 
abominable sin of unchastity among the priesthood will 
become less. God sees that she is certainly doing a good 
work in this, and without a doubt God also demands of 
her where she can do it. Who knows why God would give 
E. G. such a high intellect, and put it in a place where she 
can use and apply it with great benefit? Truly, it is not to 
be despised such great miserable misery of the 
consciences of so many priests, who are so miserably 
entangled and strangled daily with this sin without their 
guilt by human law. For God's sake, let us take this to 
heart, and help my gracious Lord to get it into our hearts; 
it is necessary and delicious in the sight of God. To this

had bitten it on the table, so that | could not read the 
passage about the inheritance of the Lord. But the other 
passage about the kingdom and the righteousness of 
God is like this: The kingdom of God is the church of 
Christ, which is ruled by the word of God. Rom. 14 [v. 17]: 
"The kingdom of God is peace, righteousness and joy in 
the Holy Spirit"; Luc. 17 [v. 21]: "The kingdom of God is 
within you." The righteousness of GOD is faith, as you 
know from Rom. 1 [v. 17.]. ! For in the Greek it is read 
plainly: xxxxxxxx XXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXxX, that is, GOD. 
Therefore, first seek the kingdom of God, that is, first of 
all, by teaching, by hearing, by considering the Gospel, 
see to it that faith and the knowledge of God are spread 
much and far; then temporal things will come to pass, 
because a laborer is worthy of his wages. 

By the way, | commend this man to you, that if you 
can do anything, hear him and help him, for he seems 
poor and helpless to me. 

Johann Pomeranus will hold his wedding on Monday 
after Dionysii [Oct. 13]. Therefore we ask you with 
diligence, and you may use yourself with diligence, so 
that he may be honored with some game, both for his 
own sake, which is worth it for his person, and for our 
sake, who are his guests; whether we are worth it is for 
you to judge. So then, go to it, that we may know that we 
are able to do something at court with petitions, for the 
future hope of others. For in regard to the lessons soon 
more, in another time. For thou knowest that he is a 
stranger and poor; therefore he must be honored with a 
richer gift,?) since he will richly earn it in the future.

returns to the passage Rom. 14,17." We consider this remark to 
be erroneous, because the cited Greek words do not correspond 
to Rom. 14,17, but are rather taken from Match. 6,33., to which 
explanation Luther now goes.

Lohmiller expresses his esteem for Luther, reports about the 
beginning of the Reformation in Liefland and especially in Riga, 
where they have a capable preacher of the Gospel (Andreas 
Knopke or Knépke or Cnophius), and asks Luther to dedicate a 
writing to his compatriots or to write to them. 


3) According to the Vulgate count; it is Ps. 44. 

4) Bugenhagen was reading on the Psalms at that time. His 
interpretation of the Psalter was published in 1524, to which 
Luther added a preface. See St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIV, 154.

affection for this city and university), that he may remain

The Council of Altenburg to Luther. 
(Regest.) 

The Canonicus of the Abbey of Altenburg, M. Mauritius 
Pfleumer, was forbidden by the Provost of the Monastery of Our 
Lady on the Mountain (Benedict Bischofs; see No. 478) and the 
Chapter to hear and teach God's word; indeed, he was beaten 
by his Chapter brothers for this reason. Now he turned to the 
council of Altenburg for protection, and they promised him safe 
conduct. The provost refused to negotiate with and before the 
council and also refused to hand over Pfelmer's effects. Duke 
Johann Friedrich, who had called for help, did not provide any 
through his bailiff Jan von Wernstorf. Now Pfleumer wanted to go 
to Wittenberg "to find out about the evangelical truth", and 
therefore the council recommended him to Luther in the most 
appropriate manner, and also asked him to be helpful for a 
supplication to the Elector, so that he could restore his 
equipment. For this reason, Luther wrote the following letter to 
Spalatin, from which the approximate timing of this letter 
emerges.

Semem [friends] in the Lord, Georg Spalatin, Christ's 

servant. 

Mercy and peace! The passage of Hosea [Cap. 4, 2. 
Vulg.]: "One blood touches the other", | understand in 
such a way that the murderous deeds have become 
frequent and have followed each other continuously, so 
that if one is not yet out of sight, others are added. "One 
murder after another." For one says literally: a flood of 
murders, with emphatic speech. 

Melchior Mirisch is a preacher with the Augustinians 
in Magdeburg, or prior, as | hear; God dampens these 
monsters, 1) Amen. 

Again, you also serve us with German expressions. 
Gen. 1,27. [Vulg.]: "Created man in the image and 
likeness of God", means according to the Hebrew: "He 
created him in the image according to the likeness of 
God"; but the meaning is more actual, man was made in 
an image similar to God. Give us that in German. Again, 
Cap. 5,3 [Vulg.] says with transposed words: "Adam 
begat in likeness after his image"; but the sense is the 
same. 

Gen. 3:16 [Vulg.]: "I will make your pains and your 
conceptions much" (conceptus); the meaning is, that 
the woman is put to many troubles in the pregnancy and 
the bearing of the fruit, as it happens. For he does not 
speak of the perils and troubles of conceiving, but of 
those of bearing the conceived fruit; now say what 
conceptus is here in German, for aerumnas ["pains"] 
we have. 

Cap. 2,18: "Let us make him a helpmate before 
(coram) him." The meaning is that he wants the woman 
to be associated with the man in such a way that she has 
her face turned toward the man and the man has his face 
turned toward the woman. 


1) Walch (perhaps correctly, according to the sense): "God 
give better newspaper!" 


He says that the woman is at his pleasure. At the same 
time, he indicates that man's attendance is with his face 
turned toward him, in order to produce fruit, by which he 
distinguishes the woman from the animals, among which 
Adam did not find such a helpmate for procreation 2c. 
We have tried "beside him, before him, around him," and 
none of them is enough for us.

are already reviewing it so that it can be submitted for 
printing. Farewell and help us. Wittenberg.

Expert opinion on whether and how to take the parishes from

Grace and peace in Christ! E. G. Scripture, Gn. Herr, 
sammt E. G. Vaters 2) mit eingelegten Briefen habe ich 
unterthaniglich durch Herrn Anshelm von Tettau, Ritter 
empfangen, und vernommen. Now E. G. knows that God 
has commanded many times that no judgement shall be 
made nor concluded on one part of the accusation, the 
other part shall then also be interrogated, however just 
or unjust a part may be. For this reason | cannot finally 
advise or conclude on behalf of the monks. For the fact 
that they should be driven out without being called and 
interrogated is not acceptable, as the Lord did not want 
to judge Adam, Cain and the Babylonians, because he 
called them first and heard them. My advice, however, is 
that since the Lord's father has given the parish to the 
monks on the condition that they keep their observance 
and first of all preach the gospel, that the Lord may 
appoint and order them before him.

and, in the presence of some reasonable people, 
reproach them and accuse them, and then hear their 
answer. If it is publicly found that it is as they are 
accused, then the church has the power and the right, 
and is also obligated to take the parish from them and to 
appoint a pious, learned man to teach the people rightly; 
for it is not wrong, indeed the highest right, to chase the 
wolf out of the sheepfold and not to consider whether its 
belly is thereby harmed. It is not given to any preacher to 
do harm, but to do good. If he does not create piety, then 
the goods are already no longer his. That is my short

since begun not to care about secret interpretations, pay 
little attention to this, because they, even if they are 
found, must be uncertain 1) since they cannot be proven 
with any clear scriptural passages. However, at this point 
| follow the simplicity of the story, because one does not 
collect lumps from the food, but only from the loaves. For 
bones, bones (costulae), scales and raft feathers are 
generally thrown away by the eaters of fish and meat 
dishes; but with loaves there is a use for the remaining 
lumps. But the five loaves signify to me Moses (that is, 
the whole teaching of the Law), and the fishes the 
examples of the Law, namely of the fathers and prophets, 
as a sign of the twofold love (which fulfills the whole Law), 
by which we are shepherded according to the teaching of 
the Law. Here you can, if you wish, catch a secret 
interpretation (mysterium): that the word of God is 
superfluous for all, that the more it is acted upon, the 
more it overflows, but that the examples of the fathers 
communicate nothing beyond faith, because each one 
serves God with his works; but God [serves] through the 
word, through the teaching, through faith to them and to 
all in general. But | like the aforementioned simple view 
more. 

Secondly. From Marcus (Cap. 1, 44. 45. 7, 36.) it is 
clear before others that Christ always sought to be hidden 
and yet could not, so that he also instructs us by his 
example that we should want the works of God in us to 
be hidden and manifest; hidden to avoid our honor, which 
the foolish people always offer us.

were conquered, stand down from Stephen? So must 
you do here also, that, having once given them this

through the nun's departure or otherwise; for he, too, now

Margrave George of Brandenburg" to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


He reports to Luther that after the monk's calf was born at 
Freiberg 2), the "form of the monster" was sent to Prague. In 
addition to him and other gentlemen, a doctor of astronomy had 
also inspected it, and against Luther had made an interpretation 
in verse and had it printed, with the pretense that the margrave 
had ordered him to do so. Now the Margrave informs us that this 
was done against his knowledge and will; he had the entire edition 
taken away from the printer and burned. If, however, a copy 
should still reach Luther, then he is to consider him unworthy. 


1) Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the later 
reformer of his country, led the government together with his 
brother Casimir since 1515, but mostly stayed at the court of King 
Louis Il of Bohemia and Hungary, whose educator he was. 

2) See Luther's "Interpretation of the Monk's Calf at Freiberg", 
St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIX, 1940 and Seidemann's Beitrage zur 
Ref.-Gesch., p.- 200. - The "form of the monster" is perhaps the 
stuffed skin, 








He says that he is guilty of the whole matter, which is imposed on 
him by his detractors. - In the postscript he asks for instruction on 
the worship of the sacrament, on praying from prayer books and 
veneration of the relics of the saints, and assures Luther of his 
gracious will towards him.

favorable gentlemen. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear 
lords and friends! | have received and heard your wisdom 
writing, together with the information about the trade 
between you and the canons, and because you desire 
my discretion and opinion, | do not know how to deny you 
my service. 

First of all, | let the treaty, which was drawn up 
between you, stand in its dignity, because | am sure that 
the law (according to the treaty) will help you in this. But 
the matter itself, and although no treaty has ever been 
made, is such that if the canons wanted to act Christianly 
and divinely, they should (regardless of all their imperial 
or papal powers) have to act in accordance with the law. 


472 Letters from the year 


1523. no. 573. 574, 473 





The term "city" is used to describe a city in which the 
citizens of the city are free, contract, law, and custom, 
and willingly submit to the common burdens of the city 
like other citizens. 

They owe it to do this from the gospel, since Christ 
Matth. 17, 27. gives interest to the emperor, and Matth. 
22, 21. says: "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's", and 
Paul Rom. 13, 1-7. says: "Let every soul be subject to 
authority", and: "Prayer to the womb, to the womb 
belongs 2c., duty to whom the duty belongs", likewise 
also St. Peter sl. Ep. 2, 13] teaches. From these: 
Commandment he has drawn no one, he be priest or 
layman, he wants to be otherwise Christians. 

And even if they want to pretend that the emperor and 
the temporal authorities have granted and approved 
such a thing themselves, it is obvious that the emperor 
cannot forgive what is not his, or what is against God. In 
addition, even if it were true that such actions had been 
taken, since such freedom has now become too difficult 
for all the world and has come into unmistakable abuse, 
it is against God, conscience, love, and also against 
reason and right to tolerate them any longer, but they are 
obliged to forgive themselves for all that, in order to 
avoid the common burden. But this is a people who do 
not think of living in a brotherly or Christian way, but defy 
with their heads until they incur too much hatred. 
Therefore | know no further advice here, except that E. 
W. kindly reminds them of such Christian duty; if that 
does not help, to add by common order that they are 
subject to the authority according to the Gospel. For it is 
unchristian, even unnatural, to enjoy common benefits 
and protection, and yet not also to bear common 
burdens and abortions, to let other people work, and to 
harvest them, especially since it has now become 
evident that nothing is needed of their being, and they 
do nothing for it, but have so far seduced us with their 
spiritual fairs. Herewith | command E. W. God, who gives 
E. W. his grace, to carry out such and all other things in 
a Christian and blessed manner, Amen. Given at 
Wittenberg on Sunday after Epiphany [Jan. 11]. ”

and that he give them "an order to sing and pray and read," that

Grace and peace in Christ. Gentlemen, honorable,

and opinion through Bastian von Kotteritzsch and 
Franzen Salbach with pleasure and joy, and | like your 
order and order of the common chest 1) almost well; |

order, to sing and pray and read, as E. L. has asked,” 
although you, by God's grace, are gifted by God with 
yourselves, do not need my small fortune. However, God 
wants to humble and serve all of us in relation to and

Christ, who will carry out the good work begun in you until 
his day, amen. At Wittenberg, Thursday after

Grace and peace! | will not stop complaining to you, 
because you are worthy of many complaints, after you 
have become an honest evangelist. Pfaffenbeck is again

me with words; | have swallowed that to make yours more 
beautiful. Now, | ask you to intercede on my behalf for the

hear his cries, and he to knock in vain at the prince's door. 

Read the news from Eisenach. In addition, my host 
writes on the watch, 5) that the abbot at Hirschfeld allows 
some free exit, both monks and nuns, and that the priest 
at Hirschfeld, after his first wife died, has taken a second. 

In Zurich, Switzerland, Zwingli scheduled a public 
disputation, which the Swiss managed. The bishop of 
Constance 6) has given the gospel a great deal of 
support. 


The order must have been written in Luther's letter (No. 580) and 
then put into print. De Wette places it too late, namely in August, 
tempted by Luther's letters to the Elector of August 11 and 19. 
These letters were written because the council was reluctant to 
introduce the order because it refused to cede its right of disposal 
over endowments, wills 2c. to the lords of the castes. 

4) De Wette erroneously places this letter in September 
because the discussion in Zurich was held in this month. 
However, the second discussion in Zurich took place only on 
October 26, and the Bishop of Constance did not participate in it, 
but had answered the invitation to it with a refusal on October 21. 
The relevant passage of our letter refers to the first religious 
discussion at Zurich, which was held on January 29, for which the 
invitation was issued on January 3.

Planitz, who was then an envoy to the imperial regiment in 
Nuremberg, had rebuked Luther for his vehement letter against 
Duke George, against which Luther defends himself here.

in the Erlanger, vol. 53, p. 161 and in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 305. 


11 At this discussion, the Bishop of Constance was 
represented by the well-known Joh. Faber and others, as well as 
by Doctor Martin Mansch from Tubingen (not by Joh. Lemp, as 
Seidemann states in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 675 s. v. Lemp). 

2) In the manuscripts: minusculum; in Aurifaber and De Wette: 
majusculum. 

3) Joh. Gilden, pastor in Weida, later in Uhlistadt near 
Orlamiinde, was found skilful and learned during the visitation in 
1529, but was deposed in 1535 because of an arousal (compare 
Luther's letter to him of June 15, 1535). 


This is what you want to receive. We will receive it

that there be no doubt that we shall not need him.

Concerns of Luther, Melanchthon, and 
Bugenhagen, 


whether a prince may protect his subjects against the 
persecution of the emperor and other princes by war for 
the sake of faith. 


In Latin, Luther's objection alone is found in manuscript in 
Gotha, Cod. B 28, p. 63 (with the caption:

ebenbafelbft Cod. A 401; in Wolfenbittel, Cod. Aug. 11, 10, fol.

Weimar court preacher D. Slbrafiam 2ange befafj, bore the 
inscription by Spalatin's hand: D. Martinus Lutherus, de bello a 
Principibus Christianis suscipiendo. M.D.XXIII. , and contained 
five concerns: by Luther, Link, Melanchthon, Bugenhagen, and 
Amsdorf; the latter with the timing we have given. All five 
concerns are found in J. E. Kappen's little Nachlese, vol. II, p. 571 
(Latin, from Spalatin's papers in the library of Raimund Krafft von 
Dellmensingen, mayor of Ulm). In German, the three concerns of 
Luther, Melanchthon, and Bugenhagen are found in Hortleder, 
"von der RechtmaBigkeit des deutschen Kriegs," Gotha 1645, 
tom. Il, p. 61, and from them in Kapp 1. 0. p. 578; in Walch, vol.

In the summer of 1522, because he was not safe from Archduke 
Ferdinand, he left his monastery and entered the service of 
Hartmuth von Kronberg as a preacher. After the latter lost his rule 
in October 1522 (see No. 587), he went to Wittenberg, where 
Luther took him in. Then he came as a court preacher to 
Mansfeld, where he did not stay long, but went as a pastor to 
Christoph Jérger in Tollet in Austria, and from there came to 
Lochau in 1528. He had to leave this position because of his 
prophecy of the end of the world on a certain day in October 1533. 
At the end of 1534 or beginning of 1535 he became pastor in 
Holzdorf near Wittenberg, where he remained until the village 
was destroyed in the Schmalkaldic War. For a while he then lived 
in Frankfurt a. O., until Duke Albrecht of Prussia made him pastor 
in Haberstrohm near K6nigsberg in 1552. Already in 1554, 
however, we find him again as pastor at Briick near Belzig, 
because he had to leave Prussia as an opponent of Osiander. 
Finally, he was professor of arithmetic in Jena and Diaconus at 
the city church there, where he died in April 1567.

praiseworthy use of singing psalms with each other 
without the prince, according to the example of the [first] 
letter to the Corinthians, Cap. 14. Even if this cannot 
happen, it is good to rather postpone the appointment [of 
new priests] than to establish Jeroboam's priests anew [1

Princes in Regensburg in July 1524 (see St. Louis edition, vol. 
XV, 2296), persecution arose and Schwanhausen had to leave. 
In April 1525 he was appointed preacher at the Catharinenkloster 
in Nuremberg and remained there until December 1525. His 
further circumstances are uncertain. He died on September 1,

To the learned and godly man, Georg Spalatin,

Lord. 

Mercy and peace! Free me, | ask, from this 
burdensome matter, my dear Spalatin. It is with Lucas 1) 
a journeyman painter [Hans von Schmalkalden], 2) who 
about two years ago either obtained it from the prince, or 
requested that he be granted a license under 





1) Cranach. 
2) The words: Hans Schmalkaldius wrote Spalatin in the margin. 


He is afraid that he would like to live safely under his rule 
until the matter of his death would be settled. Now, as far 
as | can see, he, tormented by his conscience and, as he 
says, offended by the words of his companions, fears all 
dangers and suspects treason and capture. Therefore, 
the poor man asks me to find out whether the prince has 
changed his mind and has ceased to grant him security 
in his country. He does not quite believe my words and 
those of others, no matter how much | always assure him 
that the prince's mind is not like that, nor will Lucas suffer 
a treacherous betrayal or capture without first informing 
him or warning him. For such is the miserable conscience 
of every guilty man. You will therefore free me and 
reassure him if you write either in the name of the prince 
or in your own (since it is certain that nothing of the sort 
is to be feared from the prince), and make us certain, so 
that we thus fulfill the duty of brotherly consolation. For 
nothing must be treated more tenderly than a guilty 
conscience, which is punishment enough in itself. Fare 
well and pray for me. Wittenberg, 1523, on Tuesday after

Mercy and peace! There is a girl from Torgau, who 
wants to have her bridegroom, namely the barber of our 
prince, by showing a ring and a broken coin, which is 
given to her as a pledge (arrha), and says that it was 
also declared by the prince's councilors at Torgau, since 
D. Schwertfeger 1) and Christian were present here with 
the preceptor, for a right and lawful marriage, but the 
latter now withdraws his promise, since others advise 
him to another person. Therefore she asks that the prince 
may not suffer that the promise is taken for a mockery. 
But you know that we must not tolerate that this already 
miserable sex is oppressed, and also that everywhere, 
as many very bad examples show, the girls are deceived 
by those unrighteous 2) and unrighteous people. 
Therefore, as your office requires, see to it with the prince 
that the complaint about this breach of trust is no longer 
heard. 3) Fare well and pray for me. 1523, Wittenberg,

Request for temporary support for the nine nuns who had left,

Mercy and peace! Those nine apostate nuns have 
come to me; a wretched little people, but brought to me 
by honorable Torgau citizens, namely by Leonhard 
Koppe and feilten cousin and Wolf Dommitzsch 
(Tomitsch), so that a bad suspicion cannot take place 
in this matter. | am very sorry for them, but most of all for 
the others who are perishing everywhere in such large 
numbers through that cursed and impure chastity. This 
sex is in itself far too weak, and by nature, yes, by God 
bound to the man, and is, separated by such great 
cruelty, ruined. O over the tyrants, O over the cruel 
parents and relatives in Germany! But you, O pope, and 
you, you bishops, who can curse you according to due? 
Who can sufficiently curse your blindness and fury, 
which teaches and demands such things? But here is 
not the place to deal with it. 

You ask what | will do with them? First, | will tell the 
relatives to take them in; if they do not want to, | will see 
to it that they are taken in elsewhere. For | have been 
promised by some people that | will help some into 
marriage if | can. But these are their names: Magdalena 
Staupitz, Elsa von Canitz, Ave GroBe, Ave Schénfeld 
and her sister Margaretha Schénfeld, Laneta von Golis, 
Margaretha Zeschau and her sister Catharina Zeschau, 
and Catharina voll Bora. They are such that in truth they 
are in need of mercy; in them Christ is served; but they 
have escaped quite miraculously. | beg you, however, 
that you too may be a 


Do a work of love and beg some money for me from your

daily word in such a way that the other day | could not 
get ten florins borrowed on my person for a certain poor 
citizen. The poor, who would gladly give it, do not have 
it; the richer either refuse it, or let themselves have it with 
such difficulty that they must either lose their gratitude to 
God for what they have given, or | must lose my freedom, 
but this is nothing unusual in the world and its kind. Yes, 
| have only nine old shocks as annual pay,?) apart from 
these, neither | nor my brothers receive even a penny 
from the city. But | also do not demand it from them, so 
that | emulate the glory of Pauli, by robbing other 
churches in any case, in order to serve my Corinthians 
for free [2 Cor. 11, 7. f]. 

There is another thing that | have so often wanted to 
write to you, but have just as often forgotten. | wonder 
why our prince, since he knows that his brother, Duke 
Johann, has such fathers of the household 3) that the 
estates are going to ruin more and more every day, does 
not accept Sebastian K6tteritz there, a man, as he 
proves daily with deeds and examples, who is 
extraordinarily skilled in administrative matters. For | 
would also like that Kétteritz himself would be advised, 
but much more this princely court, especially that the 
very good young man, Prince Johann Friedrich, the 
future regent, would learn by some excellent example to 
take care of the goods and to recognize the frauds of the 
people better. For those who now rule there are evil to 
me, since they have become so rich. 


1) That means: the inhabitants of my city, as Capernaum

Staupitz still pays none of our interest, and the castle

the letter was not provided with a seal. But there may be 
some reason here, which | do not ask to know: now at

prince to give her something, like those ten florins and a 
robe, either a new one or an old one, or something else.

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | have now decided for the 
third time to write to E. C. G. on behalf of Leimbach, 
although | have requested and asked most earnestly. For 
| know well, as the Scripture says [Tob. 12, 8], that hiding 
the king's secret is honest, and | have no desire to find 
out about this matter. But because he is so anxious and 
worried about it, and knows no one else to call upon 
except E. C. G., and does not want to fill people's ears 
with it, he has immediately refused to do such a service 
for my conscience. | therefore humbly and humbly ask E. 
C. G. to consider his distress and anxiety, which he has 
long since borne in such matters, and, if he has deserved 
mercy, to show mercy again. So that E. C. G., before his 
last departure from this world, may not only show what is 
right in this matter (for that is a bad service before God), 
but also something about the right and Christian and find 
himself a gracious lord.

let him. It is true that his case, as he claims, has a 
powerful appearance against E. C. G. But because God 
has forbidden to judge according to one part's 
submission, | cannot yet judge anyone in this matter, nor 
do | wish to be either a hearer or a judge, but only, if 
something could be obtained, to ask for him humbly, or 
to have Christianly admonished and warned E. C. G., if 
she is lacking as a human being. E. C. G. wants to allow 
me to do so, because | do not like it to be said that | am 
hypocritical to the Elector, or that | could say it too 
harshly. | hope | will not become an E. C. G. hypocrite, 
because | would never know why. God enlighten and

God's grace and peace before! Venerable in God 
Father, dear Doctor! The most illustrious, highborn 
Prince, Duke Frederick of Saxony, Elector 2c., my most 
gracious Lord, has ordered me to write to you that H. C. 
G. Eur's letter concerning Leympach has been received 
today and its contents have been read out, and that his 
C. G. Eur and everyone's Christian reminder and 
admonition could well suffer. Therefore also his C. G. 
would have no difficulty in trusting you to act in this matter 
between his C. G. and the Leympach. However, since 
you know that his C. G. has hitherto let himself be heard 
in all respects by His Imperial Holiness, His Royal 
Majesty and other estates that they have never had 
anything to do with your cause and you, and that his C. 
G. is in agreement with you in this matter. G. should get 
involved with you in this matter, may his C. G. be charged 
as if his C. G. had acted secretly with you; he is not to be 
held responsible for this. G. had secret dealings with you; 
undoubtedly, if his C. G. would have allowed you to act 
in the matter, you would have heard his C. G. in such 
action. G. in such an action, from which you shall find 
with truth that his C. G. does not like to give their hope 
neither to Leymbach nor to anyone else against fairness. 





wanted to inflict weight, although his C. G. know that all 
people, and before those who trust themselves, can err. 
Where it is not to your liking because you ask that his C. 
G. want to show mercy to Leymbach again, if he 
deserves it, then send his C. G. a list of the articles of 
which Leymbach complains to you from his C. G.. From 
this his C. G., with God's help, would like to be heard with 
a fair and unavoidable answer. Upon the order of my 
most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony 2c., | did not 
want to let this go unreported in the best way, and | have 
no doubt that you will send the following list to his C. G. 
about which Leymbach is to complain. 1) With this | 
command you divine protection and protection with grace 
in eternity to maintain. Date on the evening of

a very good man, learned and godly, and exceptionally 
fervent for the Gospel, for the sake of which he, having 
come here from France, has been here for some time 
and will still be here. | know that an interview [with the 
prince] will not be granted to him, but it will do you good

Mr. Nicolaus Gerbel, the pure Christian man, Martin 
Luther. 

Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord 
Jesus Christ! 

Earlier, | had secretly stolen our Philip's notes on three 
letters of Paul 6). Since he was not allowed to be angry 
with Luther, the thief, he thought that he was thereby 
excellently avenged on me, because the booklet had 
come out incorrectly due to the negligence of the printers, 
so that |, too, was almost ashamed of it and was annoyed 
by the theft, which had been so badly done. In the 
meantime 


Strasbourg (or Hagenau?) a reprint of the writing "dass Jesus 
Christus ein geborner Jude sei", to which this letter of Luther had 
been attached, was produced; therefore writing and letter must 
have appeared at the latest in May. 

5) In this determination of time, we have followed the Weimar 
edition. The guiding considerations are these: In March 1523, 
Melanchthon had finished the interpretation of the Gospel of John. 
Without his knowledge, a postscript reached Basel and was 
printed there (by Adam Petri) and published in May, of course 
without Luther's letter, which is not yet found in the September 
edition of Adam Petri, which was improved and increased 
according to the authorized Hagenau print. In April, Oecolampad 
had begun his lectures on Isaiah, which are commemorated at the 
end of this letter with almost the same words as in Luther's letter 
to Oecolampad of June 20, 4523. But already on June 11, Gerbel 
was waiting for the arrival of the commentary and letter from 
Wittenberg, as he states in the letter mentioned in the previous 
number.

of Paul to the Romans and the Epistles to the Corinthians, St.

he laughed at me and hoped that | would henceforth 
refrain from such theft, instructed by my damage. But | 
have not cared for this laughter and have become more 
daring, and now no longer steal, but rob by force, as the 
author resists in vain, his notes on the evangelist John. 
But | do not want to cut them out with words, they will 
recommend themselves to your reader, so that | do not 
again have to suffer his nose wrinkling and frowning. For 
he does not despise himself and his own out of a desire 
for modesty, but because he believes in a Christian spirit 
that all that is ours is nothing, but that Christ alone is 
entitled to everything, so stubbornly that he seems to me 
to be completely mistaken, at least in that he imagines 
that Christ is farther from his heart than he actually is. 
And even |, who try to persuade him otherwise, he no 
longer believes, so much has he increased and 
surpassed me: thus the last become the first and the first 
the last. Yes, he assures that he does not want to be 
considered the author of these remarks. Surely Philip, to 
assist the church in this matter, is too much of a nobody. 
|, too, would rather that there were no interpretations 
anywhere, and that Scripture alone and loudly reigned 
everywhere, acting with a living voice. But | do not see 
how the church could do without such interpretations, 
which at least give an indication of the Scriptures, as 
Philip's are. And who does not see that the epistle to the 
Hebrews is almost an interpretation? Likewise Paul's 
letters to the Romans and Galatians. For who could have 
so acted the holy Scriptures, if Paul had not shown that 
they must be so acted? But this showing | call 
interpreting. This alone is desired by Philip. But he 
dreams that something else is desired by him. Therefore 
| send this robbery of mine to you, my dear Gerbel, so 
that you may take care to make it common and known 
among yourselves, however much it may be against the 
will of the author. For | hope that Johann Secerius 1) will 
take pains to ensure that this is correct. 


1) Johann Setzer from Laucha in Saxony. 


| hope that this booklet will be printed more accurately 
and more precisely than my stolen book has been printed 
before. But if this relentless Achilles 2) had wanted to use 
his oratory in this booklet of himself, he might have added 
much light and pleasantness. If there should be a lack of 
order or eloquence, the wisdom and truth itself brings 
enough pleasantness and light. For this book will praise 
Philip as a true and wise man, unless Christ is not the 
truth and wisdom whom it drives and teaches, even 
though he may choose to be and be called a fool with 
Christ. And would God that we too were so foolish with 
them that we might boast [1 Cor. 1:25], "Divine 
foolishness is wiser than men are." 

| am very happy that Johann Oecolampadius is 
reading about Isaiah at Basel, although | hear that many 
people dislike this. But that is the fate of Christian 
teaching. Christ will also give us some light or 
interpretation on the prophets through this man, which is 
especially necessary for our times. Fare well in Christ, my 
dear Gerbel, and pray for the sinner and fool Luther.

To the scribes and printers of his 
Sermons. 


Inspired by a sermon on the Gospel of the Rich Man that was 
published without his prior knowledge, Luther asks in the preface 
to this sermon, which he subsequently edited himself, not to have 
any sermon printed by him unless it had been produced by his 
hand or had been printed in Wittenberg beforehand on his orders. 
It will belong to the year 1523. See Erl. Ed. (2.), vol. 13, p. 1 f.

Leimbach brothers of which you have written so often. ") 
Not that | wanted to be a judge or advocate in these 
matters (for what do these matters concern me?), but 
that in truth | fear that the prince sometimes does too 
much in such matters, as it is the fate of all princes that 
they are lacking almost out of a kind of necessity on both 
sides, namely with elevating the unworthy and with 
oppressing such people who deserve it differently. That 
this evil is also in our princes, many things prove very 
much; and even if nothing proves it, it would still be 
shown by David, the special example of all princes, who 
finally heard the godless Ziba [2 Sam. 16, 4], and 
became unjust against Mephibosheth [2 Sam. 19, 29], 
and that at the time when he was in the middle of the 
virtue of the highest kindness, so that | pass over other 
faults of him. 

| have also written to you about Sebastian Koetteritz, 
2) that you might recommend him to the prince; you have 
not yet answered, answer what you have done. If you 
have not tried anything, | will make an attempt for myself. 
| see that he, too, is very unhappy about being held up 
like this, even though by a gracious prince. For 
elsewhere a service would be open to him, if he could 
accept it with the prince's permission. But now the prince 
does not need him, and at the same time he is uncertain 
about his future.

Hansen Leimbach's abandoned debt to the Elector 
and Duke Johansen of Saxony. 


Item in the account, which is raised on Thursday 
after St. Blasius Day and decided Thursday in the 
Holy Easter Week, all in the 1500th and other year, 
my most gracious and gracious lords have remained 
indebted to me 3164 florins 6 pf. 1 heller. In addition, 
at their request and demand for the loan of my lord, 
Margrave Joachim, on Quasimodogeniti in the same 
year, 2835 florins 20 gr. 5 pf. 1 heller. Summa 6000 
florins;4) | have promised to lend to her F. G. at her 
request until Michaelmas immediately thereafter, and 
then her F. G. has promised to pay such 6000 florins 
to me again without any damage to me, as Mr. Hans 
von Minckwitz, Knight, is well aware of. Such 6000 
florins | have been deprived of from Michaelmas in 
the next year until Michaelmas in the 13th. If you 
count five to a hundred interest, they would have 
borne the time: are 11 years, every year 300 guilders, 
that is 3300 guilders. For the 11 years | took money 
on bills of exchange instead of the 6000 guilders | had 
borrowed, 21 gr. for each guilder, and had to pay gold 
or 22 gr. for half a year. That makes a year on 100 
ten 5) old shocks, makes on 1000 hun. 


3) Erl. Briefw.: servituti instead of servitute. 

4) This calculation shows that 2 Heller - | Pf.; 12 Pf. == 1 Gr.; 
21 Gr. == 1 Gulden. 

5) So put by us instead of: "ufs IIO alte schock" in Burkhardt 
and in Erl. Briefw. - The latter has all the errors found in 
Burkhardt. 


514 


The 11 years: 6285 florins 15 gr. Such 6000 florins 
wanted to pay me their F. G. again in one year without 
any damage, which nevertheless remained from 
Cathedra Petri in the 1504th year. Has my lord Duke 
Hans Duke Hans had to give me 300 guilders interest 
every year at midday, from Cathedra Petri in the 4th 
year to Cathedra Petri in the 14th, nine years, every 
year 300 guilders, to 9 years 2700 guilders interest. 
So | have also instead of such 6000 guilders, which | 
paid to Albrechten von Brandenstein, for the 
preservation of my trade money on usury must take 
and to half years 300 old shocks must pay, thut a 
whole year 600 old shocks, makes the nine year 5400 
old shocks, thut in gold 5142 guilders 18 Gr. | have 
organized all the markets in Leipzig for the 19 years 
and have not counted anything for my most gracious 
and gracious lords, there are approximately 57 
markets; if | calculate a market at 10 fl., since 1) now 
none is held, the 19 years amount to 570 2) guilders. 
Summa of the cash advanced amounts to 12,000 
summa; on it damage taken and received amounts to 
17,428 guilders 12 gr. 3) Summa of my earned wages 
still outside and the held markets amounts to 4370 fl.) 
Summa Summarum 33,798 guilders [12 gr.]. 5) On 
such before written our dear father's blessed faithful 
presentation of money, damage and earned wages 
we Leimbach have to forgive us all demand, also 
must prescribe and agree to it, as if we had received 
such a delusion to remind such debt. Although we are 
far from most gracious and kind lords. Lords, we have 
left a clear, unambiguous handwriting of our father's 
blessed handwriting, after his death. 


1) Burkhardt: "the"; Erl. Briefw.: "der [== whose]. The sense 
seems to us: with it (that is, with such a small sum) one cannot 
get along now. In the original perhaps: "dar" instead of the one 
we put: "da". 


2) "570" set by us instead of: "530".

It is easy to see that Leimbach's "Schadewacht" in the amount of

in the 15th volume of our Allsgabe, Col. 2636.

We have to deliver and hand over all the counter-bill 
and the von Brandenstein bill of debt for 6000 florins, 
which our father redeemed from his money, plus all 
the years of their F.G. transmission and order letter, 
which went out to our father, and everything else, 
which we have placed in their souls and ask Christ to 
soften grace and mercy. But above all this we still 
have outside and are promised by our most gracious 
and kind lords of Frederick of Thun. Friedrich von 
Thun, as spokesman of the same time, in the 
presence of other of their C. and F. G. counsels, that 
the 2581 florins of advanced money, which our father 
blessed in the last account of all the sum written 
before, should also be presented to their F. G., which 
Degenhart Pfeffinger, chamberlain, and Hans von 
Dolczk should receive on their F. G. order. The same 
invoice has been inspected and presented in good 
time; although our father himself had also done it long 
before during his life, nothing has happened to us 
since his invoice was made. Now into the 14th year 
we have had to pay interest on such money to the 
hundred with great damage, and still daily, and have 
had to do without ours until now without any principal 
and interest, because we do not receive ours. On 
such debt of 2581 guldens interest has run to damage 
the 14 years over 1800 guldens. In addition, we still 
owe 200 guldens to the Dabrun seizure, according to 
a contract in our father's handwriting, as recorded 
below, together with the copy of the seizure letter, 7) 
which we have humbly requested to be paid 
according to the same contract. But if the contract 
should be nothing, that we, according to their C. and 
F. G. fief letter and seal, would be consecrated in the 
same our before written goods, which 2000 florins our 
father and we since (are) the contract together with 
the seizure now also do without from the 99th year 
on. If our father and we lack such payment, damage, 
interest for the time, we have to let remain 2400 
florins, and in addition we have to miss our benefit, if 
we did not have ours, and have to live in poverty. 


6) Burkhardt: "different". 

7) We omit the communication of the "contract" following this 
document and the "Anfallbrief von Dabrun", since the complaint 
of the Leimbach brothers communicated here seems sufficient to 
us for the explanation of the letter. Burkhardt has also not brought 
the latter.

Grand Master Albrecht of Prussia to Luther. 
(Regest.) 

A credentials letter for M. Johann Oeden, who is to negotiate 
with Luther on behalf of the Grand Master. - Instruction for 
Oeden; he should instruct Luther to conceal what he will bring to 
him until the grave. Luther was to burn the letter of credence 
handed over to him as soon as he had read it; if Luther did not 
want to respond, he was not to disclose anything to him. If Luther 
agrees, however, he should present the copy of the Book of 
Orders to him with the request to show in writing how it is to be 
emended and how a reformation is to be carried out in a Christian 
manner. Furthermore, to suggest how the bishops, prelates and 
clergy who would be resident in the Order's territory, but who 
would not belong to the Order, could be brought into a Christian 
order. The order was to be brought into a Christian nature. The 
Instruction ends with a beginning "To the fifth".

Surely we have perceived this thy spirit and glorious deed

thee greater to me daily, since he delights with peculiar 
joy in thy remembrance. May the Lord also strengthen 
your intention to read about Isaiah, although it has been 
written to me that Erasmus dislikes it. But this displeasure 
may by no means weigh you down. What Erasmus holds 
in his judgment about spiritual things, or even only 
pretends to, is abundantly attested by his books, both the 
first and the last. | feel his thorns everywhere, but 
because he poses as if he were publicly not 2) my enemy,

has introduced the languages, and turned away from 
godly studies. Perhaps he will also die with Moses in the 
regions of Moab [Deut. 34, 5], because he does not get 
to better studies (concerning godliness). 3) | would very 
much like him to refrain from treating the holy Scriptures 
and from his paraphrases, because he is not up to these 
tasks and occupies the readers in vain and delays them 
in learning the Scriptures. He has done enough that he 
has shown the evil; but to show the good (as | see) and 
to lead into the land of promise, that he cannot do. But

not be moved by his name and reputation, and even

God's grace and peace before. Venerable Father 
of God, dear Doctor! The Leimbach Directory, which 
you sent me in the past few days, | have humbly sent 
to my most gracious Lord, the Elector of Saxony, and 
would have liked to give you an answer to it again 
much sooner, as my most gracious Lord was also 
inclined to do before. So far, all sorts of things have 
happened that have prevented his C. G. have been 
prevented from doing so. But now his C. G. have 
ordered me to write to you that his C. G. have no 
small complaint that the Leimbach are subject to be 
heard against you and perhaps others as well, as to 
how their list, which they handed over to you, sounds, 
and especially that, as the Leimbach should have 
had to pardon themselves of all demands, they must 
also prescribe and grant that which they have given 
to his C. G. brothers and his C. G. brothers. G. 
brothers and his C. G. in their souls and ask Christ to 
soften grace and mercy, might perhaps be 
interpreted as if the Leimbach had been pushed by 
their C. and F. G. to inequity. Now his C. G. to God

1) House Zeis. 





We hope that the Leimbach will never prove this to be 
true. However, so that you may have knowledge of 
the prescription, his C. G. have ordered me to send 
you a true copy of the same prescription, as | do 
herewith, in which you will clearly find, among others, 
that their C. and F. G. never dealt with the Leimbach 
personally, but that such an act was done by six of 
their C. and F. G. councillors, four of whom are still 
alive. However, in order for the truth to come to light 
in this deal, which their C. and F. G. want to have 
imposed upon them, their C. and F. G. are inclined, 
at the request of the Leimbach, to confess the 
councilors and Leimbach. If the Leimbach then know 
with truth that they were forced by the councilors to 
such an unfair prescription, their C. and F. G. want to 
show themselves against them in such a way that, 
whether God wills it, it shall be found that their C. and 
F. G. are not in the mood to let someone complain 
about the fairness, which you may therefore indicate 
to the Leimbach. | do not want you to know this for a 
longer period of time, and hereby entrust you to divine 
mercy. Date Friday after Kiliani [July 10, 1523.

His [friend] in the Lord, Georg Spalatin, Christ's 
servant, the exceedingly faithful evangelist at 
court. 

Grace and peace! This Moritz,°) who has become a 
renegade to Sodom in Altenburg, | recommend to you, 
best Spalatin, that you, if you can help him to obtain the 
parish in Schénewalde, near Herzberg, do this in the love 
of Christ, so that he may be given comfort in his lack. | 
believe that the man will be quite suitable for this. By the 
way, on the first of July, two of our Augustinian brothers 
from the number of prisoners in Antwerp were burned and 
died steadfastly in Christ; the most hasty of them is called 
Johann Neffe, 4) not yet thirty years old. On the fourth day 
after that a third brother, Lambert, was burned, our Jacob 
Probst's successor in word. This thing happened in 
Brussels on the public market. Thanks be to Christ, who 
has finally begun to show some fruit of our, rather of his 
word, and to create new martyrs, perhaps the first, in this 
region. Jacob himself, called by the Count of Emden, 5) 
left for Friesland; God grant that he may create fruit in 
many baptizing ones, amen.

a. Actus or act of degradation and burning of 
the three martyrs, Augustinian Order, at 
Brussels. 


Of the monks of the Augustinian order who were 
expelled from Antorf, three were imprisoned in many 
places for the sake of Christian truth; they were 
accused of some articles which they were to revoke, 
but none of them agreed to do so. Now other monks 
and clergy have traded so much with the rulers 
through money, also giving the pope that a mandate 
has come from Rome, in which the pope has 
condemned all those who hold this opinion and 
doctrine of the Gospel to be burned. At this point, 
those at the court of Brussels had the monks brought 
to justice, and held up to them several articles that 
they should recant. Among these, the two that moved 
them the most were that the pope had no power to 
forgive, bind or absolve one's sin, but God alone, for 
the pope was a more sinful man than other men; and 
otherwise they were to revoke all the other evangelical 
articles. Then they stood firm and said: No; they did 
not want to deny God's word, but would much rather 
die for the sake of the Christian faith. Then they were 
told that they had to burn. They were quite willing and 
said that they were glad that God had given them the 
grace to die for the sake of the Christian faith. 

There was [one] among these three who asked for 
four days to consider whether to recant or not, and he 
was led back to prison. The two, however, took them 
and put on all their clothes as if they had taken mass, 
and erected an altar there; bishops and other 
ecclesiastical prelates were present, took away the 
consecration of the two monks, and put on other 
clothes for them, a yellow skirt for the youngest, and 
a black skirt for the other, and then handed them over 
to the court in Brussels. They took them and gave 
them to the executioner on ropes. Then four 
confessors went with them, when the heretic 


526

527 





The following monks were present: the Master of 
Cologne, the Order of Preachers," and a friar from 
Brussels, and two other monks. These four went 
beside them, persuaded them much that they should 
recant. But they praised God for giving them the grace 
to die for the sake of His word. Apost. 5, 41. 

Now when they were come to the fire, and the four 
confessors were gathered together, the two said, 
Weep not for them, but for their sins, Luc. 23:28; and 
said, Weep for the great wrong, when ye thus pursue 
divine righteousness; and therewith they entered into 
the fire quite cheerfully with laughing mouths. When 
their skirts were taken off, one of them almost 
comforted the other, and they went into the fire with 
each other. Then the confessors asked them one 
more question: whether they still did not want to 
believe in the Christian faith? They said: We believe 
in God, even in a Christian church, but we do not 
believe in your church. So they stood in the wood for 
half an hour until it was lit. Meanwhile they kept saying 
that they wanted to die in the name of Christ. Then 
the confessors shouted at them that they should 
convert or they would lead to the devil and die in the 
devil's name. The two answered that they wanted to 
die as devout Christians for the sake of the 
evangelical truth. Then they lit the fire. They did not 
cry out in any other way than: O Domino Jesu, fili 
David, miseree nostri, O JEsu, thou son of David, have 
mercy on us! And the ropes around their bodies were 
burned rather than they were suffocated. One of them 
fell on his knees in the fire, clasped his hands 
together, and cried out, "O Lord Jesus, Son of David, 
have mercy on us. After that, both of them passed 
away and were burned to powder. 

This act lasted for four hours. After that, on the third 
day, the third monk, who had taken a care of him, was 
also burned and treated like the others. He was 
almost a learned man, who also preached a long 
sermon at the woodpile, and then went to the torture. 
And when they lit the fire, he still preached until the 
fire and flames burst out over him, and so he also 
passed away blessed in God. 2) 


1) Hoogstraten. 

2) It is erroneous what Walch |. 6. says, namely that this 
"Actus" is found in Aurifaber, Vol. Il, p. 142. There, but not 
connected with the missive, are two letters of an eyewitness from 
Brussels, from the 10. and 





b. The articles why the two Christian 
Augustinian monks found burned in Brussels. 


Namely, the Christian men in question were asked 
by Hochstras and several other heretics (who are 
called masters of other heretics because of their 
unchristian wickedness) and answered by them, as 
follows: 

Question: What do they believe? - Answer: The 
twelve pieces of the Christian faith, the biblical books 
and evangelical scriptures, also a holy Christian 
church, but not the church they, the questioners, 
believe. 

The other question: Do they also believe the laws 
of the Conciliar and Ancient Fathers? - Answer: As 
many of them as are in accordance with the divine 
Scriptures and are not repugnant, they believe. 

The third question: Do they also believe that those 
who sin mortally or damnably 3) transgress the law of 
the pope and the fathers? - Answer: They believe that 
divine commandments and prohibitions, and not 
human laws, make blessed and condemn. 

Verdict: From this, the said questioners, who for the 
sake of their wickedness cannot stand the evangelical 
divine doctrine, have recognized the above- 
mentioned two pious Christian men as heretics and 
handed them over to the secular power (as Christ did 
to the Gentiles through the Jews) for death, who have 
been unjustly condemned to the fire. 

Although it is right and proper, especially in 
Brussels, that each person's death sentence be read 
publicly, this was not done in this case out of shame 
and great injustice, but the same articles were 
thoroughly experienced by those who were in 
Brussels at the time, but by other persons. 

Item, when the High Stras put off the condemned, 
where they recanted the above-mentioned Christian 
truth, he had power or authority to let them go, one 
answered him: These are the words of Pilate, and you 
would have no power over me if he had not given it to 
you from above; and both said publicly: they thanked 
God that they should die for the sake of his word. And 
suffered such innocent torture and death not only 
willingly, eagerly, cheerfully, and continually, but 














July 14, 1523, which also report on this event. Neither are the 
"articles" (the following writing) in Aurifaber, vol. Il, p. 145 (as 
Walch says), but 62 articles on which Heinrich Voes insisted.

In addition, they gave, admonished and taught many 
Christian good answers, also praised God with the 
singing of the holy Psalms and otherwise, and devoutly 
called upon Christ our Lord, as a son of David, for mercy 
and grace, because they were able to speak before the 
adversity of the fire, For which Christian constancy all 
pious Christians rightly give praise and thanks to God 
Almighty (who bestows such great grace on these and all 
other of His holy martyrs), and, if divine honor and 
Christian necessity require it, also desire that they 1) 
exist, amen.

Martinus Luther, E. W. 2) 

To all dear brothers in Christ who are in Holland, 
Brabant and Flanders, together with all believers in 
Christ, grace and peace from God our Father and 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Praise and thanks be to the Father of all mercy, who 
at this time again lets us see his wonderful light, which 
until now has been hidden because of our sin, has made’ 
us subject to the terrible power of darkness, and thus) 
shamefully stray, and serve the Antichrist. But now the 
time has come for us to hear the voice of the turtledove, 
and for the flowers to spring up in our land. [Of which joy, 
my beloved, you are not the only ones, but have become 
the most distinguished, in whom we have experienced 
such joy and delight. For it is given unto you before all the 
world, not only to hear the gospel, and to know Christ, but 
also to be the first to suffer shame and harm, anguish and 
distress, imprisonment and peril, for Christ's sake, and 
now have become so full of fruit and strength, that ye 
have also shed and confirmed it with your own blood; 
seeing that with you the two noble jewels of Christ, 
Hinricus and John, have in Brussels made light of their| 
lives, that Christ might be glorified with his word. Oh how 
contemptuously the two souls were executed, but how 
gloriously and in

With eternal joy they shall return with Christ, and shall 
rightly judge those by whom they are now unjustly 
judged. Oh how small a thing it is to be ravished and killed 
by the world, to those who miss that their blood is 
precious [Ps. 9:13, 72:14] and their death is precious in 
the sight of God, as the Psalms sing [116:15]. What is the 
world against God? What pleasure and joy have all the 
angels seen in these two souls! How gladly the fire will 
have helped to their eternal life from this sinful life, from 
this ignominy to eternal glory! God be praised and 
blessed for eternity that we have experienced to see and 
hear true saints and true martyrs, whom we have so far 
raised and worshipped so many false saints. We here 
above 3) have not yet been worthy to become such a 
precious sacrifice to Christ; although many of our 
members have not been without persecution, and still 
are. Therefore, my beloved, be of good cheer in Christ, 
and let us give thanks to his great signs and wonders, 
which he has begun to do among us. He has given us 
fresh new examples of his life. Now it is time for the 
kingdom of God to stand not in words but in power. Here 
is what is said: "Be glad in tribulation" [Rom. 12:12]. "It is 
alittle while (saith Isaias Cap. 54, 7.) that | will leave thee; 
but with everlasting mercy will | receive thee." And the 
91st Psalm, v. 14, 15: "Il am (saith God) with him in 
tribulation; | will save him, and will set him in honor, 
because he hath known my name." Seeing then the 
present tribulation, and having such a strong, comforting 
promise, let us renew our hearts, be of good cheer, and 
with joy let us slay unto the Lord. He has said it, he will 
not lie: Even the hairs of your head are all numbered 
[Matt. 10:30.]. And though the adversaries shall cry out 
these saints Hussite, Wigleffian, and Lutheran, and boast 
of their murder, let us not marvel, but strengthen 
ourselves the more; for Christ's cross must have 
blasphemers. But our judge is not far off, he will pass 
another sentence; we know that and are sure of it. 


3) "up here" as opposed to the Netherlands.

Pray for us, dear brethren, and for one another, that 
we may reach out a faithful hand one to another, holding 
all in one Spirit to our Head, JESUS CHRIST, who 
strengthens you with grace and prepares you for the 
glory of His holy name, to whom be glory, praise, and 
thanksgiving, with you and all creatures forever and ever, 
Amen.

that he cannot resist the words of God in us, he begins to

To the Elector Frederick of Saxony, in Colditz. 
Luther asks to confirm the Leisnig caste order. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, lit. H, fol. 108, 
no. 4. Printed in the Leipzig Supplement p. 33; in Walch, vol. XXI, 
48 and in the Erl. Ausg., vol. 53, p. 194. 


To the most illustrious and highborn Prince and Lord, 
Lord Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c., 
Margrave of Meissen and Landgrave in Thuringia, 
my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and Peace in Christ. Sincerely, Reverend 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Prince, most gracious Lord! | 
have now been to Leisnig, because of the disagreement 
over their common chest, and there | learned how the 
matter stands everywhere, and namely that all pieces and 
articles are bad except for the fact that the estates, which 
until now were ecclesiastical, and many of which have 
served for ungodly endowments and abuses, have not yet 
been handed over, and some of the council refer to E. C. 
F. G.'s conclusion, and have refused the same. 


1) Faber had attended Zwingli's disputation (the so-called first 
Zurich disputation) in Zurich on January 29, 1523, as an episcopal 
deputy, but had been drawn into the disputation against his 
intention and had come off badly. On March 10, he countered 
Hegenwald's report on the course of the religious discussion, 
which had originated in Zurich, with his account of the 
negotiations. Then, however, on July 14, Zwingli's detailed 
"Interpretation and Reasoning of the Final Speeches or Articles," 
which carefully considered Faber's rebuttals, went out, followed by 
further polemics by Zwingli against Faber. (Weim. ed.) 








want to wait. Now the procession is dangerous in that 
Satan, through evil tongues, makes the matter bitter and 
worse on both sides, because it thus hangs, and in the 
end may tear an evil compartment in the mob, which is 
quite a fickle animal, where it is not composed, and 
becomes certain where it should stand. For this reason, 
my humble request to E. C. F. G. is that E. C. F. G. should 
finish the conclusion, so that not only the present shame, 
which is already driving evil mouths and hearts toward 
the gospel, but also the future joy of the adversaries, who 
wait without ceasing, may be increased, so that they may 
sing and say: Euge, euge! viderunt oculi nostri [Ps. 
35, 21], which David and many prophets also so earnestly 
ask God to prevent, and which we also owe to ask to 
come forward through E. C. F. G. (because it is placed on 
them); for the reproach of the Gospel is the reproach of 
God, which should move us justly. Thus a child knows 
well that such goods, which through apostasy of 
unchristian foundation do not belong to your council, are 
to be kept by your own authority, but are to be turned 
again to Christian custom, or where the authorities 
decree them to be. | am moved by the fact that | see, and 
have now found in the flesh, the councilors so embittered 
that they would rather suffer, and also want and want to 
help, to bring all un-Christian customs and foundations, 
which have already been done away with, into the former 
state and pregnancy, contrary to the Gospel, for which 
God's grace gives E. C. F. G. to be diligent, hoping also 
that Christ should let them do so, but still not complete it. 
This is also my reason for asking C.C.F.G. that, if the 
goods are not handed over, the box must soon pass 
away, for there is nothing there, and not so much, so that 
the people may be preserved, as the order says. 
Therefore, for the sake of God's honor, E. C. F. G. wants 
to finish the matter in the most beneficial way, not to give 
the enemies of the word room to rejoice, and the poor to 
mourn. May God's mercy teach and govern E. C. F. G.'s 
courage and mind, Amen. Leisnig, Tuesday after 
Laurentii [Aug. 11] 1523.

To the most illustrious... Lord Frederick, Duke of 
Saxony . . . Elector 2c. 

Most Serene, Highborn Elector! Our submissive, 
obedient and obliging service are E. Chf. G. always 
with diligence ahead. Most gracious Lord! On the 
summons, which happened to Doctor Martin Luther 
by E. Chf. G.'s order and gracious instruction, he gave 
us the following answer: 

He has previously admonished the chapter twice in 
writing, and then verbally in the pulpit, to desist from 
their nature, so that they would have remained in it for 
so long his preaching and writing and, as it were, 
remained in defiance. Now [the] imperial mandate 
allows nothing else. Now, [the] imperial mandate 
does not allow anything else than to preach the 
gospel purely and to prevent innovations (which he 
understands, as far as they are not contrary to the 
gospel). However, if it were understood otherwise, he 
would not follow it or comply with it. Because the 
chapter and [the] collegiate church's masses were 
against the gospel, he did not want to stop preaching 
against it, as before, and to pray diligently to God, but 
at the same time to admonish the people so that no 
one would lay a hand on them or have cause for 
violence, strife or rebellion, which he wanted to occur 
faithfully. For it was not his opinion that one should do 
something with one's hand. So it was also not his 
place to banish. But he did not want to refrain from 
the gospel, and to continue as preached before. 

We do not want to let this go unreported to E. Chf. 
G., to whom we acknowledge that we owe all 
obedience to serve. Date Wittenberg, Thursday after 
Laurentii [Aug. 13] anno dom. M. D. in the third and

To the Lord Georg Spalatin, Christ's servant and 

evangelist at court, his [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! Francis Lambert has decided to 
leave our country for Zurich, because he will be better 
nourished there and will accomplish greater things, 
because of the neighborhood of France, since he 
believes that there is a great number of those who teach 
there. You will therefore do well to be an intercessor for 
the poor man with the prince, so that he receives a gift 
for his journey, for he has also fallen into debt. Therefore, 
he needs a very charitable hand, especially since this is 
perhaps the last gift, and will recommend the name of 
the prince more to these foreigners in France. Fare well 
and pray for me. Wittenberg, August 14, 1523.

masses and vigils is quite dangerous and harmful, as | 
hope you also know to a good extent. Although | did not 
think it necessary to make such an intercession to you, 
since | know that you are otherwise favorable enough to 
him, | do not know how to refuse him. And kindly ask that

Margrave of Meissen and Landgrave in Thuringia, 
my most gracious Lord. 

G. u. F. in Chr. Durchl., hochgeb. Prince, most 
gracious Sir! | have written to E. C. F. G. about the 
common caste in Leisnig, that E. C. F. G. wants to do 
something for it. | have written to the C. F. G. in Leisnig 
for the sake of the common church, that the C. F. G. 
wants to do something for it, because even if someone 
among them has a wrong opinion, the order is still 
Christian, and regardless of who is pious or evil, | only 
want to see to it that idolatry starts again, and that the 
gospel falls and becomes a mockery; since there is no 
pay, so that there are no preachers, priests and other 
offices, and the poor must also lack them. In this regard | 
humbly request that E. C. F. G. give beneficial advice and 
help. Whatever happens, let the Gospel remain and not 
become such a shameful mockery, for which E. C. F. G. 
can well be, and is obliged to do. 

| should also ask for Bastian von Kdtteritz, as the E. 
C. F. G. might well ask for help and mercy from now on 
for himself and his children,

To the Regensburg City Council. 


Luther exhorts the city council to take up the gospel against 
the papists and to stop your superstition with the "beautiful Mary". 


From Gemeiners Kirchenreformationsgeschichte, p. 18, in De 
Wette, vol. Il, p. 395 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 201. 

Grace and peace in Christ, amen. Honorable, wise, 
dear sirs! It is desired of me by good yours and my friend 
to do a writing to your wisdom, and to admonish that after 
the papal priesthood in your city, powerful and contrary 
to the Gospel of God, has many times refused to preach 
the salvific Word of God to the poor people, and has also 
driven out some of them, among whom is also this Master 
Hans Plaumacher 1); lastly, E. W. also wanted to 


1) "Plaumacher" == blue dyer. He is also called "Plohaus", and 
was one of the first to follow Luther's teachings. 


Let them be noticed as lovers of the Gospel, and not allow 
the blinded priestly tyranny and priestly outrage to 
deprive the poor souls of their blessedness, but provide 
an evangelical preacher and handle him, as many other 
Christian cities and communities in German lands do. 
Now | hear that it almost lies in the way that the beautiful 
Mary 2) does not want to suffer if she is touched; and yet 
the gospel cannot become beautiful, the beautiful Mary 
becomes ugly. For if | were to be considered so worthy 
that E.W. believed me, | would easily prove that the devil, 
after the Jews have been driven out, has put himself in 
their place and is doing false signs through the highly 
praised name of Mary, and is deceiving you along with 
many others. For if he has the power to use the name of 
the Divine Majesty, the name of Christ, and the name of 
the Holy Spirit, how can he not use Mary's name or the 
name of a lesser saint? It is also a sure sign of the devil, 
that people run as fast as the foolish, when the Holy Spirit 
is a spirit of counsel, who does not run so impetuously, 
nor teaches servants to run away from the Lord, but to 
keep obedience. Therefore | ask you, dear sirs, to let the 
Spirit try beforehand, as St. John teaches, and not to fall 
down immediately if he shows signs. We are not so pious 
that the saints should do so publicly to us, surely you 
believe that. Herewith | command E. W. God's grace, and 
let this Master Hans and his like be commanded, Amen.

in Regensburg. On March 22, 1523, he and another citizen, 
Rostock, interrupted the cathedral preacher Augustin Marius in 
his sermon and afterwards confronted him about the sermon. On 
his complaint, Hans Blaumacher was expelled from the city. 
Provided with letters of recommendation from his friends, he went 
to Wittenberg and returned from there with this letter from Luther 
to Regensburg, where he was again accepted as a citizen on 
September 18. 

2) Not long before the banishment of Plohan, the Jews had 
been driven out of the city and on the site of the destroyed 
synagogue a chapel had been built in honor of the beautiful Mary, 


who by her miraculous deeds attracted a large number of pilgrims 
with rich gifts (De Wette).

The man you recommended | have seen and have 
been seen by him. By the way, it is nothing new that a 
trade is made out of the cause of the gospel [1 Tim. 6,

they would have liberty to the cover of wickedness [1 Pet.

for the translation of this scripture. De Wette erroneously says in

Commentary made even more useful by a German translation.

To the Lord' Georg Spalatin, Christ's servant, 

evangelist at the court of Saxony, his brother. 

Grace and peace! | have handed over the book or 
rather the large volume of the Augsburg 3) to Philip for 
evaluation. | have other things that are more urgent than 
that | could review any man's work. Indeed, it seems to 
me that such a book is not necessary in the Church of 
God. Furthermore, it is prolix, especially by a new and 
unknown author, so that there cannot even be a hope of 
profit. 

| am returning the letter of the citizen of Eilenburg 4), 
which | do not forbid nor do | mean to print. But the earlier 
letter is not of the kind that it could suffer the public, as 
the author himself admits. 

The story of the Italian or Roman nun 5) | expect, but 
fear nothing. The fiction is so coarse that if it is not 
suitable for Hadrian's master, it cannot be suitable for 
anyone, no matter how "lame". 


3) In the original Augustensis; Aurifaber and De Wette: 
Augustinensis. - As we can see from a letter of Melanchthon 
(Corp. Ref., Vol. 1,639) to Spalatin, dated Sept. 2, in which he 
gives his verdict on the book, the book dealt with the validity of 
the civil provisions of the Mosaic law also for Christian states. 

4) The shoemaker Georg Sch6nichen, who had already been 
a main promoter of the innovations during Zwilling's presence in 
Eilenburg at Christmas 1521, had heard Dungersheim preach in 
Leipzig at Pentecost 1523, and attacked him for this sermon ina 
letter dated June 4. Dungersheim replied and Schdnichen 
replicated on July 5. In addition, the latter wrote other writings, 
one of which Luther returns here. See Seidemann, "Contributions 
to the History of the Reformation", 1st issue, p. 61 ff. 

5) From a letter of Hans von der Planitz to the Elector (from 
Nuremberg) we learn that a well-dressed woman with a nun's cap 
had let herself be heard, "that she wants to turn over the 
diligence, that she might turn over a knife in Luther". He 
admonishes that if the woman should seek "perhaps to speak in 
good appearance with Luther, that one would pay attention to 
this".

That the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [Matth. 24, 
30.] will be on the day of judgment is uncertain, or the man 
Christ himself is called the sign 2c. According to the 
Hebrew way "the sign of the Son of man" is said instead 
of "the sign, the Son of man". For that by this sign the 
cross is understood is nothing. This is my opinion. 

| have no doubt that it is a mockery of Paul, since he 
saws, "I did not know that it was the high priest" [Apost. 
23,4]. The reasons by which | am moved | have indicated 
in the German booklet written against the false bishops.

| have not yet decided anything about Hadrian's bull 
2). But since the prince has not set out to answer him, why 
should | in vain draft a form, since | am busy with so many’ 
and such great things? Primarily because this matter 
requires the power of the mind and scholarship, then also 
an impeccable diligence, so that it would be necessary for 
me to devote myself entirely to it. For, for my part, | would

my mouth. You, who have leisure, do it in the meantime

Regarding the news of Halberstadt, there is only a 
rumor that a citizen named Schreiber 3), a rich and 
powerful man, was captured; six of his party were killed 
and many wounded, who had undertaken to protect the 
fugitive outside the city. It is said that

3) The mayor and clothier Heinrich Schreiber was a promoter 
of the Reformation. He was captured by the papal authorities, but 
freed by the people. On his escape, which had been betrayed, 
some were killed near Dernburg, others wounded. In Halle, he was 
then sentenced to death by the Archbishop of Mainz for sedition, 
but at the intercession of the Provost of Hildesheim, Levin von 
Velten, he was granted life. He was released from prison, 
however, on payment of a sum of money by his relatives, who had 
obtained an imperial letter for him. 





he was accused for life and death; as a cause false money 
2c. is given. It is said that the priests, whose adversary he 
was, were advising against him.

To Duke Carl Ill of Savoy. 


Luther heard from the French knight Anemundus Coctus that 
the duke was a friend of the Gospel, and he encourages him to 
persevere, at the same time instructing him on the main points of 
Christian doctrine.

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord, amen. Above all, 
| ask your forgiveness that I, a very small person, without

shine or arise and hear. Therefore, E. F. G. will credit this 
to the cause of the Gospel, that | greet you first with joy, 
Most Serene Lord. For the rumor has reached us, and 
the same has been confirmed by Anemundus Coctus, a 
knight from France, who is extraordinarily ardent for the 
glory of the Gospel, namely, that the Duke of Savoy is 
very zealous for sincere godliness through an 
exceedingly rare gift of God, at least among princes. 
Therefore, | have considered it fair that the most worthy 
prince should be blessed and encouraged by me, the 
most unworthy, at least through the service of 
congratulation, because Christ will be able to win many 
through the very beautiful example of E. F. G.. Therefore, 
in order that F.F.G. may recognize all the more the 
difference between how much she holds with us and how 
differently the god-robbing sophists have taught up to 
now under the pope, it should not annoy me to elaborate 
here a few main points one after the other, while at the 
same time giving an account of our doctrine, so that 
F.F.G. may have something to oppose those who falsely 
speak evil of us and want to tempt the righteousness of 
F.F.G. through the trickery of Satan. 

First, we are taught, and we do teach, that the 
beginning of salvation, indeed the whole fullness of it, is 
faith in Christ, who by His blood alone, not by our works, 
takes away sins, abolishes the dominion of death, and, 
as the prophet says [Ps. 68:19], "takes prison captive." 
For thus saith Paul, Gal. 2:21: "If by the law 
righteousness come, Christ died in vain; let it be far from 
that;" and Rom. 3:28: "We hold it therefore, that a man 
may be justified without works of the law, through faith 
only." But of this faith we teach that it is a gift of God, 
created in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, not formed or 
shaped by our actions (actibus, as they call it), which 
they have as the acquired faith (fidem acquisitam), 
that is, as a dream image. Faith is a living thing that 
changes the whole man, not by any merit we have, but 
by the word of God alone, 


As it says Rom. 10:17: "Faith comes by preaching, but 
preaching by the word of Christ." 

It follows from this first main part that everything that 
the popes, schools and monasteries have spread all over 
the world about gratifications, about meritorious works, 
about works that are completely and somewhat 
deserving (congruis et condignis) is predatory and an 
abomination, and that all the essays of the monasteries 
and the priests are nothing but pernicious sects [2 Petr. 
2, 1.] of which Christ foretold [Matth. 24, 5. 23.], "Many 
shall come in my name, saying, Behold, here is Christ, or 
there." For if by our works sins are blotted out and grace 
is obtained, it is not by the blood of Christ. What else can 
follow from this but that Christ died in vain? But if this is 
obtained by the blood of Christ, it is not by our works. 
What else can follow from this than that the efforts of all 
monasteries and laborers are in vain? Especially since 
they do not do their works as such, but as if they wanted 
to live before God through them, which is only due to the 
blood of Christ. We therefore rightly consider that all 
monasteries and convents (cathedrales == cathedrals) 
and all similar abominations that stand in holy places 
[Matth. 24, 15.] must be completely removed or 
abandoned, since they persuade people to trust in their 
works, to seek salvation in them, which is nothing other 
than denying the Lord who bought us, as Peter [2. Ep. 2, 
1.] says, to openly insult the blood of Christ and the faith. 

The second main thing is this, that for us, who are 
now justified by faith in the Word and incorporated into 
the fellowship of Christ, and have already overcome all 
sins and diseases in Christ, it only remains that we do 
good and live well; not that we thereby become good or 
want to eradicate sins (which belongs to faith alone), but 
that we as good trees testify by good fruit that we are now 
without sins. For as a good tree is not made good by its 
fruit, but is known by it as by certain proofs, and it is 
certain that the tree is good, which is the same as a good 
tree.

not for itself, but for others: so we also prove, as Paul 
teaches, the faith that is active through love [Gal. 5:6], by 
testifying or making certain through works that we do not 
need good works for righteousness, but already have 
them in our hearts through faith. Therefore we teach such 
works, which are not useful to us, but only useful and 
necessary for our neighbor. This is love. And here again 
the monasteries and the common _ foundations 
throughout the world are rejected, because all their works 
and undertakings are such, both of the donors and of the 
things donated, that by them they want to provide 
counsel for their salvation and that of their own, as it is 
called, for their souls. There is not a work that is sought 
for another, but only for ourselves, which is virtually 
contrary to love. 

From this it follows, in the third principal, that no 
traditions, or decrees of the fathers, or statutes of the 
conciliar, are necessary, or can make any one guilty of 
sin; 1) for as the works of them, if kept, or obedience to 
them, avail nothing in the sight of God to take away sins 
(for this stands with the Lamb alone, who takes away 
sins, even those of the whole world, by faith in him): so 
also their neglect does not make them worthy of 
punishment. And since it is impossible that there should 
be a law which, if not kept, should make guilty, and yet, 
if kept, could not acquit, - for what would that be of a law 
which, if kept, should profit nothing, and yet, if left 
standing, should do harm?- Therefore we confess that 
the world, through the popes, councils, and decrees of 
the fathers, has been miserably deceived and entangled 
in the statutes of men, and more properly in the snares 
of the devil, since all have been persuaded that if these 
things were kept, they would be blessed, but if they were 
not, they would be damned. By this fiction, Christ, the 
gospel, faith, love, righteous good works, Christian 
liberty, and the right to be free, are all lost. 


1) ad peccatum obligare == to commit a sin, that is, to make it a 
sin for him if he does not keep the statutes 2c. - Missed in the old 
translation: "or may bind us to sin". 


and, in sum, snatched away the palm of bliss, so that we 
are forced to run in vain. 

Accordingly, the extremely abominable tyranny of 
excommunication, with which they fortified their 
abominations, had to be abolished and abandoned. For 
the bishops have no other office in the church than the 
service of the word, and the ban can only have a place if 
someone sins against faith or love. In these cases the 
pope not only does not banish, but gives freedom and 
security in it, both by his own example and by his word. 
But in his god-robbing statutes alone he lets his 
lightnings shoot. These [statutes] should (as | have said) 
be free, rather entirely absent, since Christians must be 
governed by nothing but the Word, by which they 
become Christians, that is, free from sins, that is, by the 
pure Gospel of GOD alone, without the additions of 
concilia, teachers, and fathers. For what is the use of 
governing Christians with such a word, by keeping which 
they neither become nor remain Christians, but rather 
cease to be Christians and lose Christ? But every word 
except the gospel is of this kind, since (as | have said) it 
is not our works but the blood of Christ that washes us 
from sins. Therefore, salvation reigns in us not by the 
works and virtues of men, therefore not by the laws of 
men, but by the power of Christ alone. 

Furthermore, those who are not Christians are to be 
kept in check in another way than by the statutes of men. 
For these are to be left alone and (as Paul says [1 Cor. 
5:11]) have nothing to do with them. It is (as it is called) 
the secular sword, they are authorities; it is up to them to 
keep the wicked from evil works through the fear of the 
sword, as Paul teaches Rom. 13, 4. But the Christians 
will be governed by a bishop without the sword, only by 
the word of God, since it is certain that those are not 
Christians who are not good of their own free will. Such 
a person grows out of the power of the Spirit of faith, as 
it says in Rom. 8:14: "Whom the Spirit of God impels, 
they are the children of God." What is it, therefore, for an 
un

Is it sensible to force the voluntarily good with laws that 
are for the wicked, or for those who do not want to be 
good? Indeed, Christians, too, as they do everything 
voluntarily, put themselves under the sword and under 
the laws for the wicked. Yes, they also use the sword, not 
for their own benefit (since they have no need of anything 
for righteousness and salvation except faith), but as an 
example to others and to preserve the common peace 
and to strengthen the right of the sword. Therefore they 
are free and shall freely use any statutes and ceremonies. 

But this is the most abominable thing, and nothing else 
than the very audacity and sacrilege of the Antichrist, that 
he has not had enough of plaguing the free Christians 
with his foolish and useless laws, which are also harmful 
to the faith, but on top of that, he has laid his obviously 
robber hand on the testament of God. First of all, he has 
deprived the whole world of both forms of the Lord's 
Supper, although Christ so clearly said, "Drink from it, all 
of you." Here it is absolutely necessary not to be 
subservient to captivity. It has been spared the weakness 
of many enough whom he has held captive and still holds 
captive. Therefore, finally, the use of both parts of the 
Sacrament must be restored, quite confidently, even 
though the gates of hell or the angels of heaven would not 
want it, since we have the prestige and the testimony of 
the divine majesty, indeed also its institution and 
command. So [it is also an abominable abomination] that 
they have made a work and sacrifice out of the Mass, 
which is a word of the promise of the Gospel, with the 
attached sign of the body and blood of Christ, instituted 
to nourish faith, always putting their works in the place of 
faith, They are senseless and offer Christ every day in so 
many thousands of masses, while he offered himself 
once and does not want to offer himself anymore, and this 
is not necessary, since he has taken away the sins of all 
who believe once and with one sacrifice [Heb. 10, 12.14.]. 

These are approximately the main parts of the things 
| wanted, most Serene Prince, that E. F. G. (as she has 
started) help 





would like with active zeal to bring them to fruition. ') | do 
not want anything to be done or tried by force of the sword, 
and that will not progress well either, but only that those 
who preach the gospel purely may be safe and be called 
under the rule of Your Serene Highness. For this will be 
the way that Christ will destroy the Antichrist with the spirit 
of his mouth [2 Thess. 2, 8.], so that he, as Daniel [Cap. 8, 
25.] says, will be broken without hand, whose future 
happened through the effect of Satan with lying signs [2 
Thess. 

2, 9.]. For Satan will not cast out Satan, but by the finger 
of God the devils are cast out [Luc. 11, 20]. Farewell then, 
most noble Prince and most gracious Lord! Stoke up the 
spark that has begun to glow in you, and make a fire go 
out from the house of Savoy, as from the house of Joseph, 
and make all France like straw to him [Obadiah, v. 18.And 
let the holy conflagration of Christ be kindled, yea, let it 
burn, that at last France may indeed be called the most 
Christian of all kingdoms by the gospel, which hitherto, by 
the ungodly service against the Antichrist, for the shed 
blood, has been ungodly called the most Christian of all, 
amen. But the Lord Jesus Christ blow with his spirit into 
your and your hearts, that you all do what serves the honor 
of his holy word, amen. Wittenberg, Anno 1523, the

evangelist of the church at Ndérdlingen, his in 
Christ exceedingly dear brother. 


Mercy and peace! Up to now, neither you nor | have 
made use of your love, dearest Theobald; but the matter 
requires it in such a way that | am forced to use yours 
first. | recommend this priest, who has become a 
husband out of necessity of conscience, to you, since he 
has the confidence that he can live safely with you for 
the sake of the neighborhood, if he should be 
encouraged by your protection. For under his archbishop 
it is not yet permitted to live chastely in public, that is, in 
marriage, until Christ has shown otherwise. You will now 
be able to judge best whether he should live with you 
publicly or secretly as a husband. | have a very great 
confidence in you, so much so that | think | would be 
more difficult for you with more words if | thought 
differently of you than of a brother who does not look at 
what is his own, but at what concerns others. To this end 
serves the exceedingly glorious testimony of Philip about 
you, so that | expect no less from you than from Philip 
himself, whom | hold no differently than myself, except 
for the learning and righteousness of life by which he 
puts me to shame, not alone surpasses me. You are well 
in the Lord, and may you have good progress in your 
holy office. Wittenberg, 1523, Lambert's Day [17 Sept).

2) The treatment that the fugitive Hutten had received on his

not to compromise himself with his high patrons, prompted Hitten 
to write: Ulrichi ab Hutten cum Erasmo Roterodamo, Presbytero, 
Theologo, Expostulatio (June 1523), to which Erasmus replied 
with a venomous Spongia Erasmi adversus aspergines Hutteni

no one, rather as if there were only a few who noticed 
what Erasmus was dealing with. If Erasmus writes for 
himself in this way, it is more desirable that he writes 
against himself. For he has done unbelievable damage to 
his name and reputation through this book, so that | really 
feel sorry for the man who never approaches the matter, 
and thus rages against the faults of friends for the second 
time, while he was so mild against his enemy Lee 
(Laeum), and otherwise admonishes everyone not to 
revile even the enemies, and detests this very much. | 
always expected he would act the thing. It is easy against 
life to prove his oratory. Furthermore, my letter, which | 
wrote privately about Erasmus, 1) then also the other to 
Fabricius,” has been published, which makes me very 
angry. Although | am not ashamed of a word, if | had to 
defend it publicly, it is nevertheless annoying to me that 
through these impetuous braggarts (| do not know whom 
to name) what is written privately to good friends is made 
public. Furthermore, as the scribblings of Erasmus do me 
no harm if they are against me, so | will have no more 
confidence if they are for me. | have one who can defend 
the cause, even if the whole world should rage against 
me alone; this is what Erasmus calls persistence in 
asserting myself. But since | see that man is so far from 
the understanding of Christian things (which | had not 
meant until now, although | sometimes suspected it), | 
gladly suffer him to call me by any name he wants until 
he touches the matter. For | have resolved that | will 
protect neither my life nor my morals, but only the matter 
as | have done so far; whoever wants to may belittle me 
and my morals. Yes, | clearly owe my life even in my body 
to those people, and a large part of the joyfulness of my 
spirit, who revile and torment me most horribly: so much

human prudence. May the Lord enlighten him and make

|, Martin Luther, Ecclesiastes of Wittenberg, bear 
witness with this manuscript of mine to this dear brother 
of ours, Gregorius Morgenstern, that he has kept himself 
honest and honorable in the Augustinian Order, that no 
one can accuse him of anything else; also that it has 
always been the custom and right of this Order, in 
constant practice, not to admit anyone unless he was 
born of honest, blameless parents and of noble birth. 

Therefore, | ask all pious craftsmen, if they would let 
my handwriting be helpful to him instead of his birth 
certificates, so that he cannot bring them up before the 
authority of the sovereign. Since, according to Christian 
doctrine and truth, he intends to give himself up from the 
dangerous state to a blessed state, since he, like all 
Adam's children, wants to nourish himself with the sweat 
of his brow, with God and honor through the help of pious 
people. This, in turn, Christ will undoubtedly let them earn 
with right grace through His own. Hereby commanded by 
God. At Wittenberg, on the Saturday after Michaelmas

To the Lord George Spalatin, the servant of Christ, his 

[friend] in the Lord. 


Hail in the grace! The death of Hadrian 1) | command 
GOtte. 

By the way, | do not remember that anywhere in 
Scripture it is found that the faith and gifts of God in us 
are dark and uncertain, since they must necessarily 
come into operation; | confess that some [gifts] are weak, 
sometimes hidden when the opportunity is lacking, as 
when Elijah, after killing the prophets of Baal, feared 
Jezebel, and went where his will led him, not the Spirit [1 
Kings 19:3]. 

The word: "The Lord knows the way of the righteous" 
[Ps. 1, 6] is a contradiction, because the Lord does not 
know the way of the wicked; that is, he recognizes and 
approves, again, he does not approve nor recognize. 
Thus, "He leads His saints astray" [Ps. 4:4] is said of the 
cross, that He leads His faithful astray, as He led 
Abraham out of his father's house, and he did not know 
whither he should go, Heb. 11:8. But for this reason he 
was not unaware that he believed, rather he felt the most 
faith at that time, since he did not realize nor know the 
place whither he should go. 

In Halberstadt, some people with disguised faces 
have the Carmelite Provincial 2) 


1) Pope Hadrian VI died at Rome on September 14 at 7 p.m., 
according to Roman reckoning. Spalatin determines this as 2 
o'clock in the afternoon. 

2) Valentin Mustaeus had come to Halberstadt and had 
preached the Gospel with the support of Heinrich Schreiber (No. 
654). During his imprisonment in Halle, at the instigation of three 
canons, their servants broke into his cell, threw his library into the 
latrine and killed him by a man brought with him. They threw his 
library into the latrine, and had him castrated by a cutter they had 
brought with them. The council let him heal. In the following year, 
15 men wanted to do the same to the abbots of the Bergen and 
Ammersleben monasteries in retaliation, but they were prevented 
from doing so.

Grace and peace! | do not yet have another place 
where | can send you, dear Johann, so it shall be at your 
discretion whether you want to stay there or come here; 
we are waiting for a calling. To take a wife, if you feel like 
it, is good, but you will not be able to preside over the 
service of the word, if you have not first become an 
ordained minister in a certain place, or if you do not 
intend to support yourself with your hands. 

The passage Jeremiah 9 [v. 26, Vulg.] about those 
who are circumcised by the hair, refers in general to all 
Gentiles who cut the hair on the forehead at two angles, 
as all our laymen do. For the Jews were forbidden both 
to shave the hair or beard and to cut it off in front, 
especially on the forehead. Therefore Jeremiah 
distinguishes the Gentiles from the Jews by this mark. 
"The mark of the beast upon the forehead and upon the 
hands" [Revelation 13:16.] (though the book is obscure 
and uncertain) is, in my opinion, outward obedience to 
the pope and his laws; which we also keep and confess 
with our hands, that is, by public observance. For 
whoever did not do and live and speak publicly as the 
pope has ordered until now, was a child of death. No 
matter how inwardly he might be of a different mind, he 
still had to accept and show the mark of the beast.

Grace and peace from God our Father and our Lord

Michael Stiefel, my dearest in Christ, as your pastor 2) 
together with the side preachers should have put, 
namely: 

The first is that they will henceforth graciously absolve 
those who dissent from the Lutheran doctrine, even 
though they may justifiably reject them as condemned by 
the pope and emperor. 

The other is that they want to expel and not absolve 
those who eat meat or eggs contrary to the custom and 
the law of the Roman churches, where they do so 
publicly without just cause. 

The third is that they want to keep the people to 
confess all their sins, of which they are aware, before the 
priest, because Luther himself praises and praises 
confession. 

The fourth, they want to keep as before, in the cases 
and sins so reserved to the pope and bishops. 

The fifth, because a -good habit is considered so 
much as a right or laws, they want to keep the people to 
confess twice in the fast. 

The sixth, they do not want to absolve those who do 
not want to repent and pretend that Christ has done 
enough for all.

Although now, my beloved, it would not be necessary 
to answer such poor, loose articles, since | do not doubt 
that there are many among you who see well what 
blindness and foolishness are in them, and who do not 
hold more firmly to the Gospel, because they are moved 
by such articles, | do not know what good it would do 
them if | wrote a hundred times against them, since | have 
in sO many books so many times displaced and 
sufficiently weakened all such dreams of men and 
foolishness with mighty writings; but because it is so 
warmly desired by me, | want E. Dearest, as much as | 
have leisure, | will write about it. 

First, we have preached, taught and written that all our} 
deeds are not valid before God, and that we should 
despair of all our works and abilities; but through Christ's 
blood and merit alone we must be redeemed from sins 
and saved, as St. Paul says Rom. 3,23. ff.: "They are all 
sinners, and lack that they cannot boast of God, but are 
justified without merit by His grace through the 
redemption that came by Christ, whom God presented to 
the throne of grace, through faith in His blood" 2c. 

Then we see that it is not our works, since we are all 
sinners and can do nothing but sin, but Christ's blood that 
redeems us, if we believe otherwise, for | cannot earn 
Christ's blood and redemption with works; otherwise 
what need is there of faith, which alone grasps, 
accomplishes and retains such redemption? And if our 
works would earn so much, they could also obtain 
forgiveness for two, three, ten sins, and finally for all sin. 
But if they do not merit forgiveness of all sin, they may 
not redeem one sin. 

But now the text is clear, that without merit, and freely, 
sins are forgiven in Christ's blood, that he might redeem 
us. So either it must be true that we cannot by our deeds 
blot out one sin and obtain mercy, or if we can blot out 
one sin, we may blot out them all. But if we can put away 
sin by works and obtain mercy, Christ's blood was shed 
without need or cause; so it is false that St. Paul says, 
"Sins are forgiven without merit, freely by grace.

forgiven through Christ's blood, whoever believes this. 

This is the main point and foundation of Christian 
doctrine, that we cannot atone for or do away with sin by 
our works, but believe that Christ has done so with His 
blood; this faith, without any works, does away with all 
sin. 

From this few pieces you see that your blind pastor's 
articles are all unchristian and blaspheme against the 
precious blood of Christ, as well as both pope, bishops, 
emperor and princes, who condemn and persecute such 
doctrine, which is so publicly stated by St. Paul. So the 
priest acts as a wolf, and not as a guardian of souls, that 
in the sixth article he demands atonement for sin, just as 
if our works should make atonement for some sin, which 
is such a great office that no one in heaven and earth 
could accomplish it, but the Son of God Himself through 
His own blood alone, as Heb. 1:3. says: "He has purified 
sins through Himself." Whoever wants to follow this 
article of the priest must deny Christ with his blood and 
consider it idolatry, as he, the priest, does with his own. 

Thus the first article is also a condemnation of the 
blood of Christ, for Luther is nowhere condemned, 
except that he teaches Christ's blood through faith to be 
useful and necessary for the forgiveness of sin alone; 
which is against the pope and all his laws, who teaches 
it by his own works. Therefore Christ's doctrine and the 
pope's doctrine are contrary to each other, like day and 
night, like death and life. Whoever follows this article is 
condemned before God; if he does not follow, he is 
condemned with Christ and his teachings before the 
world of Pope and Emperor. 

The other article is foolish and foolish, where he has 
the opinion that such obedience, and shunning meat, 
should be a good work, and atone for sin. For, as | said, 
neither eating nor drinking, neither hunger nor thirst, 
does it, but the blood of Christ alone. If then such 
obedience does not destroy sin, neither can 
disobedience make sin. For where obedience is without 
need and profit, there is also disobedience without harm 
and danger. Therefore, in the sight of God there is no 


562 


Letters from the year 1523. No. 665. 


563 





It is a sin to eat meat or fish, whichever day | want, as St. 
Paul teaches Rom. 14, 17. and 1 Cor. 8, 8.: "Eating and 
drinking does not benefit us before God. Item: "God's 
kingdom is not eating and drinking, but love, peace and 
joy." Whoever lets his conscience be bound by this article 
denies Christ and his blood and is a heathen. 

In addition, we have taught the other main thing, that 
the Christian life is love for one's neighbor, that we 
henceforth have no law, nor are we indebted to anyone, 
but to love, Rom. 13:8; so that we may do good to our 
neighbor, as Christ has done for us through His blood. 
Therefore, all the laws, works and commandments that 
are required of us to serve God by atoning for sin are 
nothing from God, and whoever keeps them denies 
Christ, such as fasting, celebrations, confessions, 
pilgrimages, endowments 2c. But which law, work and 
commandment are demanded of us, to serve the 
neighbor, those are good, those we should do, as, to obey 
the worldly power in its regiment, to follow and serve, to 
feed the hungry, to help the needy 2c. 

From this it follows that, because confession is a work 
that is not directed toward the neighbor and does not 
serve him, it is not commanded in any way, nor is it 
necessary. And he who does it as if it were necessary, 
and must do it before God, denies Christ: for no work of 
all things need remain against sin, where Christ's blood 
alone cancels sin. Therefore, the third, fourth, and fifth 
articles of the priest's unchristian and unjustly set, to bind 
consciences, and to trample Christ's blood underfoot, so 
that he may not escape the penny of confession. 

It is true that | said it was a good thing to confess. 2) 
Item, | do not forbid fasting, walking, eating fish, 
celebrating 2c., but so that such things are done freely, 
and no one who does not do them, as if he had to do them 
in his conscience and in a mortal sin, as the pope rages 
with his ladders for the blind. We want and should have a 
free conscience in all the works that we do. 


1) Weimarsche: "nothing". 
2) In the writing "Von der Beichte, ob die Pabst Macht habe zu 
gebieten". St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 847, § 69. 





do not serve the faith or the love of your neighbor. 
Confess confidently, fast happily if you want, but do not 
think that it must be, and commit sin if you let it be, or 
want to atone for your sin before God with it; for with that 
opinion you fall from the faith, and are never a Christian. 

Because there are zero many weak consciences, 
which are caught in Pabst's laws, it is good that you do 
not eat meat 2c. For such not eating flesh becomes 
thereby a work of love, because thou serveest thy 
neighbor thereby to follow his way, and to spare his 
conscience. But if your neighbor is not offended by this, 
or does not see that you eat flesh, then you shall eat flesh, 
not considering the pope: for in all this the work is no 
longer in love and the service of the neighbor; therefore 
you shall not keep it, because it pleases you of your own 
free will 3) to do so. Such an order of works in love we 
owe; but the works themselves we do not owe. But where 
there are impudent drivers, and not weak consciences, 
and want to make a necessity or law out of it, then one 
should and must only do the contradiction in defiance, so 
that not the works, but only the blood of Christ may have 
the honor to eradicate sin and to make righteous. 

This, my dearest ones, | have answered in a hurry to 
the blind articles of your soul tyrant for the sake of weak 
consciences; for you may read further reasons and 
explanations in my booklets on Christian freedom, on 
good works, on monastic vows, and on the doctrine of 
man to be avoided?) 2c. Although | would like everyone to 
read and hear St. Paul, who teaches such things so 
abundantly in his epistles, that my or anyone else's books 
would not be necessary. But God grant you righteous and 
evangelical doctrine, and that his word may bear fruit with 
you, to the praise and honor of the ineffable grace of God, 
through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen. Pray for me, my 
beloved. Given at Wittenberg, on the Sunday after

settled and put to rest. 

By the way, since you are our and everyone's mediator 
between the prince and us, our prior asks,*) , that you 
execute an order with the prince against our interest man 
Christoph von Bressen in Mutterwitz, who is almost a 
whole year in arrears with the payment of the interest of 
90 gulden. He has, of course, received various periods of 
respite from us because of his wedding, and it might have 
suited us, if we wanted to be wasteful, to waive the whole 
thing; but because our affairs are not in such a state now, 
the interest would be postponed with danger for him or 
would grow to a large sum. Then Blank also urges us 
from the smaller choir. 5) Accordingly, since at last the 
whole estate will revert to the Prince, since | am almost 
alone the inhabitant of our monastery, may he see to it 
that | spend the short time of my life

here from our interest and next from his. Or if this is 
burdensome, let him take it immediately. Because of the 
lack of interest, we have certainly been living for a long 
time by incurring debts. But | hope | will not live long, if 
Christ is gracious to me and the prince of the world is 
angry. 

You treat the provost Jonas a bit too ungraciously. It 
is easy for you to torment a man who is otherwise already 
well humiliated by more than one complaint, both from 
his marital status and from his household, while you, 
meanwhile, are rich and without a wife, free, and have 
only yourself to care for in good leisure. Dear, do not 
deceive the good man with even more misery, and do not 
believe all those who denounce him to you. He certainly 
does not seem to me to be a different man than he has 
appeared to me so far, indeed greater than he has been 
so far. The Torgau man may be good after all, but he is 
godless and has the prince as his idol; | know that. And 
how is it that one does not want to allow Jonas in his 
burdensome situation this small interest for nothing, 1) 
for a short time, which can be allowed without sin, and 
that one nevertheless insists that those godless people 
do not keep their godless masses daily with greater 
blasphemy against God even, or that one does not even 
resist them? Here | appeal to your equity. Are you not 
also men, in that you entertain such an opinion, rather, 
would you not like to be regarded as being guilty of all 
ungodliness, since you are the effective cause that they 
persist in it? Therefore, spare as you wish to be spared, 
and forgive that you may be forgiven. Let others deal with 
us, and we would surely find abundantly what we offer 
them.

meant in such a way that the prince, after he had taken 
all our rights, should nourish us with the usual interest 
until our monastic system completely fell away; then he 
should have it all for himself, as from the beginning. We 
are moved by the fact that from now on we have no hope 
that the interest owed by Staupitz will be paid, and that 
from day to day he will be burdened again and again with 
other interest to be paid annually. For our last letter of 
request and the order of the prince have been of no use 
to us, so that there is a danger that the property will be 
burdened too much by the arrears (retardatis, as it is 
called). Some thought that the consent of the vicar or the 
general should be obtained, but since we now neither 
read, nor roar, nor say mass, nor do anything that the 
foundation has decreed, it seems that the benefice and 
the service have lapsed, and must rightly be confiscated, 
except that we can be fed for a time because of the war 
against the pope. You have our opinion, you will judge.

Mercy and peace! Your messenger has returned to 
you, my dear Nicolaus, but | believe that my earlier letter 
has reached you. In the meantime, however, while | was 
thinking about your matter, it seemed good to me to have 
something printed shortly in which | describe (as | have 
written) the way to say mass. Meanwhile, if you can, 
abolish either all or many private masses. Then | will 
change the Canon and some ungodly prayers. For | do 
not see why we should change the other customs, 
together with the vestments and altars and the vessels, 
since a godly use can take place in these, and one cannot 
live in the Church of God without ceremonies. For of the 
other things | have written abundantly in other books. 

The Picards hold thus of the Sacrament, that Christ 
under the bread is not bodily, as some say that they saw 
there blood and a little child, but spiritually or 
sacramentally, that is, he who receives the bread visibly 
receives in truth the natural blood of him who sits at the 
right hand of the Father, but invisibly. Above this we 
cannot condemn them, for so we also hold. Then, that 
they do not worship, they refer to the same thing, that he 
is not there visibly, as the visions have him, but invisibly, 
that is, at the right hand of the Father. Take the short letter 
of the busy man with patience.

To Georg Spalatin, evangelist at the court, who is 
highly esteemed in Christ, his [friend] in the Lord... 
Grace and peace! That man who has the flow of seed 
of which you write to me, when otherwise right seed 
departs from him, that is, with very great pleasure and a 
shock, as the flow would be if he attended a woman (for 
there are people in whom such a flow is so small, and 
almost without pleasure, that it is thought to be only a 
kind of superfluous moisture, which neither a woman nor 
any power could remedy): if this person lives in idleness 
and abundance, he will be able to try, first of all, to 
subdue his flesh by bodily work and fasting; then there 
will be hope of recovery; but if he will not or cannot work, 
he must, according to God's command, unite himself with 
a woman, otherwise he will tempt God and remain in sin. 
By the way, that you also often write and others 
reproach me that the three youngest canons were 
chosen on my advice, while | preach the opposite, | have 
always despised as an all too great lie. But it is necessary 
that | finally justify myself, since | see that if | remain 
silent, this will spread and gain credence. | have advised 
no one that he should vote, or that he should ever be 
voted for, since | would certainly prefer that at this hour 
that house of Satan should lie down. But the matter is as 
follows: After they had been elected without my 
knowledge and in my absence, and | was also convinced 
that the prince's opinion was that their [the canons'] 
number should remain full and all that idolatry untouched, 
so they consulted me whether they should accept the 
election? Here | advised thus: since the money is to be 
thrown away to any people, 1) who would be [canons], 
the best would be that it would be thrown away to those 
who would be worthy and skillful, and they would receive 
it for this reason.

The prior 2) is surprised that you do not know what is 
the matter with our debt to Blank 3). When we call Blank 
our Danista*) , we mean the smaller choir, to which we 
have been paying 20 florins annually for many years. 
Therefore, you will make it clear to the prince that we will 
receive our money in full from Christoph Bressen, and 
Blank will kill us (as he is an impetuous admonisher) with 
words of admonition alone. Then, in this poverty of ours, 
we have received grain in full from the castle owner, and 
he presses us even more. Therefore, you will either ask 
for us that this debt be given to us through the kindness 
of the prince, or that we soon receive the money from 
Bressen. Otherwise we have nothing at hand with which 
we can pay, and in the meantime many other things have 
been taken on Borg, and that one [the castle owner] is 
doing us quite nice rude things. Farewell and pray for me.

Grace and peace! | intend to produce German psalms 
for the people, that is, spiritual songs, according to the 
example of the prophets and the old fathers of the 
church, so that the word of God may also remain among 
the people through song. We are therefore looking for 
poets everywhere; but since it is given to you that you 
have the German language in your power and know how 
to express yourself delicately in it, and have also refined 
it through varied use, | ask you to work with us in this 
matter and to set about transforming some psalm into a 
song, as you have my example here. | would like, 
however, that new words and words that can only be 
used at court would not be used, so that, according to 
the comprehension of the people, simple and quite 
ordinary words would be sung, which would 
nevertheless be pure and appropriate at the same time, 
so that the meaning would be rendered clearly and as 
close to the Psalms as possible. It must here

2) This letter perhaps already falls into the end of the year 
1523. Burkhardt, p. 78 places it "at the beginning of January", 
because already on Jan. 14 Luther refers back to it. 


The words should therefore be used freely: one must 
keep the sense, let the words go and replace them with 
other suitable words. | do not have the gift to produce 
something like that in such a way as | would like. 
Therefore, | will try whether you are a Heman, an Assaph 
or a Jedithun. | would like to ask the same of Johann 
Dolzig, who is also rich and graceful in words, but only if 
you have time for it, which | assume does not happen 
much now. But you have my seven penitential psalms 
and their interpretations,*) from which you can take the 
opinion of the psalm, or if it pleases you that a psalm be 
assigned to you, | assign to you the first [Ps. 6]: "Ah God, 
do not punish me in your anger," or the seventh [Ps. 143], 
"Oh God, hear my prayer," and to John Dolzig the second 
[Ps. 32], "Blessed are those whose iniquities are 
remitted," for the [Ps. 130] "Out of the Deep" has been 
edited by me 4); [the 51st Psalm] "God, have mercy on 
me" has already been ordered to be made. 5) Or if these 
are too difficult, take these two: "I will praise the Lord 
always" and "Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous," that is, 
the 34th and 33rd, or the 104th Psalm: "Praise the Lord, 
my soul." But answer what we have to hope from you. Be 
at ease in the Lord.

For it is not allowed to condemn her, either when she is

without her having been convicted. Therefore, that Erfurt

Carlstadt has set up a printing press in Jena in order to 
have printed there what man only wants by indulging his 
weaknesses, namely that he is willing to teach where he 
is not called, but where he is called he is always 
obstinately silent. Although this matter can do little, 
indeed nothing, to harm our preaching ministry, it will 
nevertheless bring disgrace to the princes and our 
academy, since the Elector and at the same time our 
academy have agreed and promised through writings 
and words that, in accordance with the imperial edict, 
they will not permit®) to print anything unless it has been 
overlooked and approved by persons appointed for this 
purpose. Since the Prince and all of us now keep this 
promise, it is not to be denied.

To the respectable and highly learned man, Mr. 
Gregorius Brick, Doctor of Both Rights, Chancellor 
of the Duke of Saxony in Weimar, his [friend] to be 
highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! To the man who desires a second 
ife on Carlstadt's advice, the prince may answer thus: 
he husband himself must be firm and certain in his own 
onscience by God's word that this is permitted to him. 
herefore, he may ask such people for advice who can 


make him sure by the word of God. Whether this is 


arlstadt or someone else is none of the prince's 
usiness. For if he is otherwise uncertain, he cannot be 
ertain by the prince's permission, who is not entitled to 
lecide anything in this matter, and it is up to the priests to 
nswer the word of God, from whose mouth one hears the 
ord of God. 


4) De Wette, as it seems to us, has rightly given the letter this 
ate, understanding Pauli as Pauli Eremitae, January 10, because 
his letter is earlier than the next one. Schiitze and the Erlangen 
orrespondence have it as Convers. Pauli (Jan. 25), and therefore 
ate it: "January 27". 


586 Letters from the year 
The Lord's law, as Malachi 1) [Cap. 2, 7] says. | confess 
indeed that | could not resist it if someone wanted to take 
several wives, 2) nor does it contradict the holy 
Scriptures; but nevertheless | did not want such an 
example to be first introduced among Christians, among 
whom it is proper to refrain even from what is permitted 
in order to avoid trouble and to lead an honorable life, 
which Paul demands everywhere. For it is very unseemly 
for Christians to pursue the highest and outermost things 
of freedom so anxiously for the sake of their convenience, 
and yet neglect the common and necessary things of 
love. Therefore, | did not want to open this window in my 
sermon 3) and hardly believe that a Christian is so 
abandoned by God that he should not be able to abstain 
when his spouse 4) is prevented by God. | am afraid that 
there is some kind of malice involved. 5) But let it go 
wherever it goes; perhaps those at Orlamiinde will also 
circumcise themselves and become completely Mosaic.

know whether the one who received the letter delivered 
it. By the way, | have two preachers for Oelsnitz. But one 
of them, whom | would most like to have serve in this 
preaching position, has a female wife; otherwise he is rich 
in all the gifts that befit an evangelist: Modesty, learning, 
godliness, and honorable manners distinguish both him 
and his wife. For he has now lived with us for more than 
two years without reproach and very praiseworthy.

Gregorius, 8) but about a pastor for Oelsnitz 9) nothing is 
written to me. Here with us is the pastor of Cranach, a 
married man, whom | believe you know. He would be the

not: "the pastor at Oelsnitz", Wolfgang Crusius, as the Erl. 
Correspondence takes it. Because about Crusius was written 
several times to Luther, as his letters to Michael von der StraBen 
and to the council of Oelsnitz (No. 668. 684 and 685) prove. Here 
it concerns the reoccupation of the in the meantime finished 
parish position there.

To the godly and learned man, Magister Georg 

Spalatin, evangelist at court, his [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | am sending you, dear Spalatin, 
the letter of Argula, the disciple of Christ, so that you may 
see it and rejoice with the angels over a sinful daughter 
of Adam who has been converted and become a 
daughter of God. If you can reach her, | ask that you greet 
her in my name and comfort her in the name of Christ. 
For | too am seeking how to reach her, and would have 
written already if | had been sure that letters could come 
to her through you. 

Incidentally, everything is still good with us, as it was, 
except that the way from Wittenberg to Kemberg is 
accused with many and great cries up to heaven, and for 
this reason, the prince also has a bad reputation. God 
would have him leave his life with this testament and 
improve this path, since he could easily do so. The 
Cardinal of Mainz rages now for the third time with the 
episcopal tyranny also in Halle, after he has raged in 
Miltenberg and Halberstadt, the unfortunate man. 
Farewell and pray for me. Wittenberg, Anno 1524, the 
day after Anthony [Jan. 18].

To a great extent, with killing, steaming and persecuting 
the Gospel with all their might. The noble Lady Argula of 
Staufen is now fighting a great battle in this country in a 
great spirit and full of the word and knowledge of Christ. 
She is worthy that we all pray for her, that Christ may 
triumph in her. She has attacked the academy at 
Ingolstadt with writings, because they have urged a 
certain young man Arsacius 1) to a shameful recantation. 
Her husband, who is already a tyraNn against her, is now 
pushed out of his office for her sake; just think what he 
will do! She is alone among so many monsters, and 
although she has a strong faith, she is, as she herself 
writes, at times not without despondency of heart. She is 
a special instrument of Christ, | commend her to you, that 
through this weak little vessel Christ may put to shame

in prison on September 17, 1523. Against this, Argula von

Scriptures, punishes the high school at Ingolstadt for having 
conned a Protestant youth into speaking the Word of God. Date

translating the Book of Job, which is holding up the printing of the 
third part of the Old Testament.

Nuremberg, as if you were in Rome, so that we do not

conspire to some future monstrosity. For a long time | 
have received a letter from you, but in the meantime 
everything is so silent that it is equally 1} uncertain to us 
whether there is a pope or whether an imperial diet can 
be assumed. But we hope, since Easter time is 
approaching, that the princes will be incited by their 
confessors and preachers, that they will render a service 
to Christ in satisfaction for sins, in order to be able to 
communicate worthily, and pursue the gospel anew with 
new examples. | also expect at the same time what 
spiritual songs you have produced about the Psalms, as 
| wrote the other day. 2) 

With us, everything still stands well. Only in the 
translation of Job have we had a lot of trouble because

help them to get something from the monastery. Lord, the 
young prince, that his F. Grace would help them to get 
something from the monastery. One of them, Michael, 
would like to study here and then be used for preaching, 
where my lord could give him something either from his 
own grace or from his own. Lord either gives him 
something by his own grace, or provides him with 
something from the monastery's spoils, since they say it 
is done badly. The other, Heinricus Zwecz, is almost poor 
and would like to have a handicraft from the same 
monastery, in which he has brought something honest of 
his inheritance. Now | do not like to bother my lord. | do 
not like to trouble my lord with it, nor do | know how things 
are done, and you are also more idle and more skilled 
than | am; | ask in Christ that you take such trouble upon 
yourselves and think and do in my name for the two 
brothers in my lord's name. Lord, as much as it is 
possible, so that they will finally give up the running to 
and fro, and we will also get rid of them. | will earn this 
again, and Christ will recognize it. Herewith, in God's

Grace and peace! It is not to be wondered at when 
the princes seek their own in the Gospel, and new 
robbers pursue the old robbers. For the light of the world 
has dawned, in which we see what the world is, namely 
the kingdom of Satan. So Paul also complains [Phil. 2, 
21] that they all seek their own. Furthermore, this very fact 
must encourage us, because everything corresponds to 
the old examples of the Gospel. It seems to me that the 
council of your city should not yet be written to, but | will 
write at another time. Indeed, | cannot fulfill so many

To the highly esteemed man, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, Bishop of the Church in Zwickau, his 


superior in the Lord. 


Mercy and peace! Nothing has been decided against 
me at Nuremberg, and our prince has returned. ') There, 
however, the Lord has miserably killed the chancellor of 
Trier by the stroke of the river, who two days before his 
death had bragged at a banquet that before the feast of 
St. Martin our trade should be done with the sword; but 
this obvious hand of the Lord does not at all frighten the 
stubborn. Furthermore, the princes and bishops accuse 
the councils of the Imperial Chamber Court and the 
Swabian League, the latter because they ruled in favor 
of the Nassau against the Hessians,”) the latter because 
they devastated their lands when they drove out the 
robber barons (praedones). The emperor also wrote to 
them and punished them for not carrying out his 
command against Luther. 

| have dealt with the baptism of small children in 
Postille 3), which is now being printed. You yourself know 
that confirmation is nothing other than the laying on of 
hands and prayer. 

It would be little if Carlstadt were only ungrateful, but 
he persecutes us even more horribly than the papists do. 
He gives birth to many monstrosities, as Spalatin 
complains to me, as you will learn in due time. Your clan 
Storck 4) reigns in these people, 5) after being expelled 
from Zwickau, he has knocked out his hiding place there,

because the whole school and all of us highly desire it: so 
he blocks himself with a few words of defense, that he is 
appointed and paid by E. C. F. G. for the Greek lessons, 
which he would have to wait for, and may not leave them. 
For this reason, my most humble request is that E. C. F. 
G. see to it, for the benefit of the dear youth and for the 
greater promotion of the Gospel of God, whether it would 
be possible for E. C. F. G. that such a salary would be 
interpreted to him on the Holy Scriptures. Since there are 
many young people who can teach the Greek lesson well, 
and it is not good that he always deals with the childish 
lesson and leaves out a better one, since he can produce 
much fruit, which cannot be rewarded with any money or 
salary. God would have us have more of those who could 
read like this; otherwise, there are enough of them, 
unfortunately, who swarm, and may well need time and 
people, because they are here by God's grace. The time 
will come, as it did before, that one must let up for the 
sake of such people's lack, even if one does it unwillingly. 
Therefore it is to be understood here that we people go 
out because we can, and yet do our best for our 
descendants, and where E. C. F. G. has loved to provide 
such, | ask you to bind the aforementioned Philipps in 
earnest to wait for the writing with diligence, and if he 
should also be given more pay, then he should and must 
do so. E. C. F. G. be commanded in God's mercy, Amen|

To the learned and godly man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 

evangelist at court, his [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! The passage of Ezekiel, Cap. 34, 
is in the middle [v. 10.], where it says: "Behold, | will 
myself to the shepherds, saith the HErr" 2c., with which 
Johann Hus wnrde plagued by Zacharias; Staupitz told 
that he had heard it from Andreas Proles, as you know. 

By the way, | ask you to see to it that this note with 
the enclosed petition is presented to the prince, and see 
to it that an answer is given. For although | am extremely 
reluctant to get involved in these matrimonial matters, 
the inertia and tyranny of both powers have so far sunk 
the matter so deeply that Christ himself is needed as 
judge and counselor. | am therefore forced to serve the 
miserable need, which, | ask, you also do not want to 
escape. 

Rumor has it that in addition to those three servants 
of Ferdinand, four other servants of the same Ferdinand 
were found hanged from a tree in the Nuremberg forest, 
with weapons and spurs. And it is said that at Constance 
a defection to the Swiss is being attempted because of 
Faber's violence. The married priests of Strasbourg have 
issued a vehement appeal against their bishop, which | 
will send shortly. Oh, about the princes and bishops who 
are doomed to future ruin, since in such a great 
movement of things and minds they do not mean what 
God threatens them with, but rather strive for misfortune 
of their own free will and bring it on themselves. Fare well 
and pray for me. Wittenberg. Martin Luther. 


berg could be known? So De Wette, D. Enders says: "I verinag 
this Rathsel not to solve." - We would like to make the 
assumption that Luther accidentally wrote Paschatis instead of 
Pentecostes, then May 14 would be the date of the next letter. 
This assumption receives great probability from the fact that 
Luther mentions the appeal again in a letter to Capito of May 25, 
and that the same divorce matter is discussed again in a letter to 
Spalatin on June 2. Already Rohrig, Gesch. der Ref. im ElsaB, 
Vol. I, p. 186, has expressed the assumption that 26 Magi is to

Instruction for the prince next to the 
petition. 
The marriage case behaves like this: 

|, Martin Luther, have heard the case between 
Michael Hanck 2) and his wife in the presence of the 
priest and the secular judge. Finally, Michael has been 
convicted by eight witnesses, men of credibility and 
standing, that his wife has been in constant danger of 
death with him for many years, that he beats her so, 
rages so, attacks her so often with his bare sword, that 
one would think he was out of his mind. Nor does he feed 
them; rather, if there is anything in the house, he carries 
it out and wastes it. Since they unanimously testified to 
this, we passed the sentence that she should be divorced 
from him and left it to the discretion of the authorities as 
to which secular law they wanted to punish him by. Above 
that she agrees to return to him, if he would only be put 
to the test for a quarter of a year or half a year, or kept in 
check, whether he might want to or be able to change. 
Here they say that the magistrate will not agree to a 
concilium assembled from | know not how many 
thousands of doctors, that this divorce is valid, and cares 
not for so many witnesses; nay, at the risk of death (which 
they say is an empty delusion) they wish to compel them, 
pretending that this example of divorce would bring many 
others after it. Here they ask that the most noble prince 
have mercy on the woman and order the matter to others 
than the magistrate or us, and provide the helpless 
woman with justice and equity, as he owes, as the 
petition enclosed here states.

| sometimes fail to grasp what you say because of the 
sluggishness of my mind, and so pass over it with 
silence. You seem to me to condemn many purely 
external things that have nothing to do with faith and 
righteousness; they are neutral things, and since they 
are done in faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, they do not 
trouble the conscience at all. Why then are the hearts 
of the simple troubled, and what has made the habit 
of the monks detestable to your judgment, which most 
of them wear in holy faith in Christ? Unfortunately, 
abuses creep into almost all human practices, and 
rare are the people who measure everything by faith; 
nevertheless, there are some; therefore, one must not 
reject the essence of a thing because of an accidental 
flaw found in some. Everywhere you reject all vows, 
though you have good reason in very few, perhaps in 
only one. Therefore, dearest friend, | besiege you with 
petitions, remember the little ones and do not trouble 
the timid consciences. | beg you, do not condemn 
what is neutral and can stand with sincere faith. But in 
those things which are contrary to faith, cry out, do not 
desist. We owe a lot to you, dear Martin, who led us 
back from the swine droppings to the pasture of life, 
to the words of salvation. May the Lord Jesus prosper 
us so that we may finally live the gospel which we now 
hear with our ears, which many have in their mouths, 
since | see that innumerable others misuse the gospel 
for the freedom of the flesh. But the Spirit blows where 
it wills [John 3:8]; we owe you thanks because you 
have planted and watered, and leave the glory to God, 
to whom alone we attribute the power to make God's 
children. | have written enough, but God wanted me 
to talk to you for just one hour and reveal to you the 
secrets of my heart. | commend to you, my dear 
brother, the one whom you see before your eyes, the 
bearer of the present letter, 5) that you make him your 
disciple by your effort and by your influence, that he 
receive the Master's Bard as soon as possible and be 
sent back to me. | certainly hope that he will produce 
good fruit and bring honor to the University of

fair ecclesiastics of the Saxon court, his [friend] in 
the Lord. 

Grace and peace! Thus | advise others and at all 
times: If someone, through the word of God, has 
received the conscience concern that he cannot take 
one form alone, and yet his faith is so weak that he does 
not dare to take both forms for fear of men, then he 
should for the time being abstain from the sacrament 
altogether, since there is no danger involved if one has 
left the whole sacrament pending. 2) 

You courtiers know better than we how to ridicule 
those antics about the canonization of Benno, since you 
are clever and well-versed in how to politely reject such 
tempters. 3) 


!) This date is derived from Melanchthon's letter to Spalatin, 
Corp. ref. 

2) The foregoing was translated into German by Spalatin, 
probably for the Elector, because of whom this question will be 
asked (Késtlin, M. Luther [3Z, Vol. |, p. 637). Burkhardt, p. 70, 
reports this translation as a "concern of Luther, Melanchthon and 
Bugenhagen freely imposed by Spalatin". Spalatin's manuscript 
is in the Weimar archives. 

3) The canonization of Bishop Benno of Meissen, who died in 
1106 or 1107, had taken place in May 1523 by Hadrian VI, and 
on June 14, 1524, the solemn elevation of the bones was to take 
place, for which letters of invitation were sent both by Duke 
Georg and by the Bishop of Meissen, also to the princes of the 
Electorate of Saxony, with the request that the placates 
(cedulas), in which the bishop had died in 1106 or 1107, should 
be made available. 


However, it seems to me that it is not in the prince's 
power to do what is demanded, especially at this time 
and with such kind and minded people, since not even 
the emperor and the empire, not even Duke George 
himself has been able or is able to do this in his country. 
For | myself, as soon as | learn that the nonsensical note 
has been posted, will not let myself be prevented from 
attacking these temptations of Satan for the sake of 
warning in a small published paper. May they therefore 
post it, it is certain that an edict alone cannot prevent 
them [the posters] from being attacked with invective, 
and even hardly by an armed crew, which stands guard 
without interruption day and night by the note. | have 
nothing else. Carlstadt, who was summoned by the 
university, is said to have arrived at Wittenberg on

forbade the clergy and students to attend the disputation, which 
the magistrate had already allowed. On the other hand, the city

| hear the gospel taught by you, and believe it, and 
rejoice in it. But | also wish you luck in this, that you 
condemn the interest of redemption, as | also have 
condemned it. But this one thing thou dost add of thine 
own, that thou dost command those who make such 
[interest] not to pay it, uno making them guilty of usury if 
they make or pay this illicit interest, as people who 
consent to usury. This is not gospel, nor have we ever 
taught it. For on the same ground it will follow that he 
who takes the skirt, or strikes the cheek, is not to be let 
off the cloak, and that one must not suffer the wrong. We 
hold with the Gospel that this interest is unlawful, but that 
it is not in the power of the common man to set it aside 
and declare it null and void. For this is the duty of the 
princes who wield the sword. For the common people it 
is enough, since they know it is illegal, that 1) they 
protest that they are paying an unreasonable demand to 
the one who demands it. They must therefore offer it, 
however unreasonably they may demand it; they are 
sufficiently secure in conscience if they say that they 
suffer the unreasonableness, but do not agree. | would 
like you to stand thus in the matter; if you do not stand 
thus, we must necessarily stand against you. Now 
farewell and pray for me, and may the Lord keep you in

good and godly to allow those poor people to enjoy this

of our Bethaven do not want to change anything, even

ungodly, and also realize that the prince is hypocritical if 
they do not realize that he even insists on it and demands 
it; and so they knowingly rage most horribly against their

To the faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Jakob StrauB, 
evangelist of the people of Eisenach, his extremely 
dear [friend] in the Lord. 

Mercy and peace! | would like, dearest friend, that you 
think no differently of me than that | think the very best of 
you, even if such things occurred that would be 
burdensome. For | am convinced that you triumph above 
all things through the glory of the gospel. Furthermore, 
as we are human beings, something of the carnal man 
must sometimes come in between, but this cannot be 
such, nor should it be, that love does not want to bear it; 
otherwise where would it remain [Gal. 6:2]: "Bear one 
another's burdens"? The only thing | find fault with you 
for these usurious interests is that you think that they 
should be allowed to those who take them by force, but 
that they should not be offered with one's own hand. | 
beseech thee, since this tyranny reigns in all bodies, how 
shall he not yield to the adversary, and give them with his 
own hand to him that commandeth to pay, who, as thou 
teachest, should leave them to him that taketh them? | 
beg you to consider only this. The great multitude abuses 
the gospel, it does not let itself be governed by the 
gospel. Therefore, they must be left to the laws, so that 
those who use freedom only to give room to the flesh 
may be of service [Gal. 5:13.f.]. ) By the way, | ask that 
you pursue the cause of teaching the youth among your 
own. For | see that the gospel is threatened with a very 
great fall through neglect of the education of the youth. 
This matter is the most necessary of all. Greet Schalbe 
and Scultetus in my name. | would have written to both 
of them, but it is unbelievable with how great matters | 
am overwhelmed, so that | alone can hardly cope with 
writing the letters. The whole world is beginning to be on 
my back, so | wish either to die or to go away.

To the faithful servant of God, Mr. Georg Spalatin 
evangelist at the Court of Saxony, his [friend’ in the 
Lord. 

Grace and peace! D. Schwertfeger, the dear man 
passed away yesterday in a gentle death and sleeps in the 
Lord, my dear Spalatin. Now you know that Johann Ape 
2) is here, who is also otherwise recommended to th 
prince, who could be put in his place for the lection, oa 
he wishes it. But why should it be necessary t 
recommend him to you, since you know the man and kno 
that he is not only suitable for this lecture, but also godly 
and Christian? Not to mention how he has been plague 
up to now by damage to his property and insult to his goo 
name, and spends his life almost in the greatest want, an 
is oppressed by poverty in his house. Therefore, you se 
how godly you will make your effort when you Sonne 
him to the prince, and become the cause that his 
recommendation and the good hope given to him before 
will be refreshed. If now his wife should be in the way,° 
that 


1) According to Spalatin's letter to Mutian of May 9, he was in 
Lochau at that time. 

2) Compare St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIV, 258, Note.

reservations. ;

he- could not be accepted publicly, he could teach in the 
name of another, but that the salary would be paid 
secretly. But what is the use of your continuing to 
pretend, since they [the papists] will not let you go 
uncharged, and can do so justly, because you cherish 
heretics. 

The people of Bremen are making progress in the 
word, so that they have appointed our Jacob of Ypres 4) 
as evangelist at the second church. Both dukes of 
Mecklenburg desire evangelists, the one through Hans 
Léser, the other through the prior at Sternberg, 5) Duke 
Heinrich of Brunswick, as Cordus Rutius testifies, begins 
to accept the gospel by calling someone of our order from 
Helmstadt as preacher. After the council of Brunswick 
had rejected him, he can decree in his house in 
Brunswick,® that he should preach. For he praises his 
brother Wilhelm, who is a prisoner, 7) nevertheless as 
very Christian. The disputation of Johann Hess 8) at 
Breslau proceeded happily, since the so many envoys of 
the kings and the artifices of the bishop resisted in vain. 


4) Provost; he was employed at the Liebfrauenkirche. 

5) Joh. Steenwyck. - Cordus Rutius is the well-known poet 
Euricius Cordus. However, the favorable circumstances changed 
very quickly in Brunswick, for already on June 24 he wrote to 
Lang that the duke suspected him of being a Martinian and that 
the council was hostile to the Evangelio. It was not until 1528 that 
the pressure of the guilds opened the gates to the Gospel. 

6) This passage offers, since in the original constituat should 
stand, quite special difficulties, on the one hand by the consecutio 
temporum: recusasset - constituat, on the other hand by the 
sense, which can be with this reading hardly another, than that 
Henry may order the preacher appointed by him to the chaplain 
for his imprisoned brother. Aurifaber and De Wette read: 
constituit. Then the sense would be: the appointed preacher has 
decided to preach in his house. But then the following does not 
follow the preceding. 

7) Wilhelm, the younger brother of Henry of Brunswick, was 
imprisoned by the latter in 1523 because he demanded the 
division of the country and co-government. He remained in 
captivity for twelve years. 

8) The disputation took place on April 20-23 on the theses put 
forward by Hess, which dealt with the word of God, the highest 
priesthood of Jesus Christ and marriage. The theses are printed 
in Kapp, Nachlese, Vol. Il, p. 606.

To Capito in Strasbourg. 


Luther is annoyed that the rumor is spread that there is a great 
discord between him and the Strasbourg theologians, which 
probably comes from the fact that his letter to Capito (No. 447) 
was printed. He rejoices over the marriage of the priests and the 
departure of the monks and nuns from the monasteries.

IV, p. 347. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 899. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! If it were not for your 
constant assertion, my dear Fabricius, and Bucer's with 
you, that there are some people who say that we 
condemn what you do, and that we are in complete 
disagreement, | would have been ready to interpret this 
to the weakness of your suspicion because of our long 
silence, since | heard the same thing said by the brethren 
who traveled here to us barely three days ago, when | 
received this letter of yours. And although Christ thus 
reigns among you, and you have no harm to fear, whether 
we do not agree with one another, or whether we 
condemn what is yours, yet nothing is more vexatious to 
me than to hear our disunity so highly exalted, while there 
is the highest unity and sincere and perfect unity of spirit. 
Since | tend to cover up and conceal as much as | can, if 
some of our people deviate from us in truth (as many | do 
not know what kind of spirit is already doing), how much 
less can | suffer this annoyance and this kind of injustice 
against Christian unity and spiritual peace. Therefore 


1) In the original resistente; in the older editions: resistentibus. 

2) Apel received the position with an annual salary of 50 
guilders, for which he had to give the lectures in Digest. vet.; in 
addition, he took over the lecture on canon law for Jonas, for 
which the latter gave him 20 guilders. 





If | were not too busy, | would not refrain from testifying in 
a public writing both about the lie of those ear-blowers and 
about our sincere fellowship in Christian matters. 

| like extraordinarily the marriages of the priests 3) 
and the monks and the nuns with you; | like the appeal of 
the married against the bishop of Satan; 4) | like those 
who are called to the parishes. 5) What shall | say? After 
that | have heard nothing but such things, by which | have 
been highly pleased with you. Continue, and let your right 
hand also teach you marvelous things, and let the nations 
submit to you in the midst of the king's enemies [Ps. 45:5 
ff]. Yes, | think that in these years enough has been given 
to the weak. Henceforth, because they harden more and 
more day by day, everything must be acted and spoken 
of in the freest way. For I, too, will begin at last to cast off 
the habit which | have hitherto retained for the 
strengthening of the weak and the mockery of the pope. ® 
We will let the dead bury their dead [Matth. 8, 22.], they 
are blind and blind guides [Matth. 15, 14]. 

| believe, however, that this quite trivial rumor of our 
discord arose from my letter to you, which has already 
been printed so many times and has now also been 
translated into German. This almost deters me from 
writing letters, since | see that they are thus dragged to 
the presses against my will, although one may and must 
write many things more freely among friends than is 
advisable to spread throughout the world. 


3) In the last months of 1523 Martin Enderlin, Anton Firn and 
Matthis Zell had married; in January 1524 Wolfgang SchultheiB 
(an Augustinian monk), Conrad Spatzinger, Lonicer, Alexander 
von Villingen (a Johanniter) and Lucas Hackfurt (Bathodius) 2c. 
Capito did not marry until August I. 

4) Compare N6. 721 and 722. 

5) Namely Bucer to St. Aurelien, Theobald Schwarz (Nigri) to 
Old St. Peter and Capito to Young St. Peter, all around Easter 
1524. 

6) Already in 1523, Luther no longer wore the habit in his home, 
but ordinary clothing, but publicly he took off the monk's habit only 
in 1524. On October 9, he preached for the first time without it; 
then only one more time in it on the morning of the following 
Sunday (Oct. 16), in the afternoon without it (Késtlin, M. Luther 
[3.], Vol. I, p. 597 f.).

The man to be revered in the Lord, Georg Spalatin, 

evangelist at the court of Saxony, his [friend] in the 
Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Above all, | ask you to 
restore my good standing with the prince through these 
letters, which bear witness, since it has been somewhat 
injured by the rash rescript of our Wittenberg council, 
since they indicated to the prince that he had not been 
properly reported on the divorce case between Michael 
Hancke and his wife. Perhaps they did not know that the 
report had been made by me, therefore they dared it all 
the more. For in the presence of the Schésser and 
Gregorius,”) the Mitcommissarius, | convinced them that 
my report was correct, and they promised that they would 
yield to my judgment as to what could be learned from the 
Schdsser and Gregorius. 


1) Hedio did not hold a wedding until May 30. 
2) Gregor Burger. 





| do not know whether | am lying or not. But | do not want 
them to be blamed as if they had deceived the prince 
with a lie. Perhaps, as we are human beings and are 
always driven by Satan, they have been overtaken by 
this error, and for this reason, in a spirit of prudence, they 
have considered that we also suffer our punishments in 
hell,9) each one his own, and no one is pure from filth. 

| have dealt with Veit Jerig, 4) the guardian; he is 
willing to take over the office of a pastor in Heimchen, as 
he is also worthy and suitable, if he is called and elected. 
| will therefore work with the mayor in Diben (Didon) so 
that he and the citizens desire and call him. You, too, 
should intercede with the prince so that he will be 
allowed and appointed. 5) Thirdly, the Leimbach have 
again been to me with very great complaints. And that | 
say what | have heard: the lapel which they have given 
to the prince, the copy of which you have sent me by 
order of the prince, 6) is given in such a way that they 
should obtain the fief and the right of possession in this 
way. By the way, they were promised at the same time 
that after the handing over of the reverse a settlement 
should take place, and they should also be satisfied, | do 
not know with how large a sum. But this has been 
postponed until today and has not been fulfilled. This 
they present with so great a semblance that they have 
made the matter probable to me. In addition, they show 
the letters of Frederick Thun, which say more or less the 
same thing. Then one senses something of violence and 
coercion in the lapel itself, as if it had been wrung from 
[them] by the prince. Therefore, | ask you to make an 
effort that [finally] both the prince and | are freed from 
this matter. | do not like to burden the prince with these 
monstrosities, since | have no pleasure in them, and they 
are not part of my office, and yet

About tithes, which are good and to be kept; the re- 
purchasable interest should be abolished. 


Printed in Bibl. Brem. Cl. | V, fasc. V, p. 913; in Strobel- 
Ranner, p. 100; in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 524 and in Erl. Briefw., vol.

Grace and peace in the Lord! Our Philip reminded me, 
my dear Fabricius, that | would like to open my opinion 
about the tithes 1) to you, since one hears that the 
common people there want to refuse them. Indeed, tithes 
seem to me to be by far the most just of all, since they 
have existed through divine testimony and almost from 
the beginning of the world, and also the cheapest, since 
they increase and decrease only as much as the earth 
bears through the blessing of the Lord. Therefore, every 
effort must be made to keep the tithes intact, so that there 
is something to pay the authorities and the princes. 
Rather, those who fight against the tithes may be bent on 
abolishing the re-purchasable interest and other such 
burdens that plague the whole world. And yet, God 
wanted that after the abolition of all other interests, not 
only the tithes, but also the ninths or eights would remain. 
Of the Egyptians even the fifth was given [Gen. 43:34.], 
yet they lived. We cannot even live on the tithes, so much 
do other customs and burdens rage. So | stand and ask 
that you help others to do likewise, so that the mob may 
not be allowed such licentiousness. Greetings to all, and 
pray for me. Wittenberg, Wednesday after Barnabas 
[June 15] 1524.

the priestly tithe. In 1525, this dispute was settled amicably.

the wrong address: "An den Churfirsten Friedrich." De Wette's 
remark with respect to the first piece: "on the validity of Mosaic 
rights," that it was hitherto unprinted, is erroneous, for it is found 
in the Jenaer Allsgabe (1585), vol. Il, p. 464b and thereafter in the 
Altenburger, vol. Il, p. 815; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XIX, p. 351 
and in Walch, vol. X, 402. - Completely, this entire writing is found 
in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, 354, but, just as in the Jena edition, 
without indication of the addressee and with unresolved time 
determination. From this a wrong note arose in ibid. Col. 912, in 
which the later letter of the duke (from June 24) is listed as a 
request to Luther, whereas the earlier letter of Luther to the duke 
(June 18) is listed as an answer to it. - Readings to be improved: 
Col. 356, line 2 v. u. read: "ob's" instead of: als, and line. | v. u.: 
"GOtt" instead of: gar. 


1) De Wette is mistaken in assuming that this is Emser's 
writing "Wider der zweier Prébst zu Niirnberg falschen Grund und 
Ursachen" 2c., because the writing against which Emser's is 
directed was published only in October 1524. What is meant can 
only be either Missae Christianorum etc. assertio or the "Answer

Luther expresses his joy about the blessed effectiveness of 
Brismann. He recommends to him the Specatus, who has been 
appointed by the Grand Master, and asks that he, together with 
him and his colleagues, work to ensure that the Grand Master 
follows his advice, namely to make his principality a secular one, 
and to marry.

To the highly esteemed brother in Christ, Johann 

Brismann, the servant of God and faithful servant at 

the word at K6nigsberg in Prussia. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Your letter was 
exceedingly pleasant to me, my dear Brismann, and filled 
our mouths with joy, because the Lord Jesus thus 
promotes and strengthens his word with you. May He 
grant that it may continue in this way until the end, until 
His [last] day, and increase more and more, amen. 

We also love you very much, because you make sure 
that nothing is done by force and noise, but everything is 
done by the power of the Word alone. May the Lord keep 
and increase this spirit in you and all others. 

But there comes to you as a comrade D. Paul 
Speratus, who is called there by the Grand Master. | 
recommend him to you from

hearts. He is a worthy man and has suffered many things; 
from him you will hear everything that goes on in these 
lands. Satan has awakened prophets and sects among 
us, who finally go so far that they want to use weapons 
and violence to spread their opinions; | see that we will 
have to deal with them from now on. Carlstadt also 
remains the same as he has been and keeps it himself 
with these people. People boast unbelievably about their 
spirit, which they claim to have directly from God, almost 
without Christ, so that it seems as if they only want to 
make Christ an example for us and take away all 
sacraments together with Christ. 

There is a rumor that the cruel edict of the emperor, 
which was passed three years ago at Worms," that the 
Lutheran sect is to be completely eradicated, is to be 
omitted, and some cities of the empire are in fear; but 
Christ lives, who will also conquer and triumph. 

By the way, when | first 2) spoke with Prince Albrecht, 
the Grand Master 2c., and he consulted me about his 
order rule, | persuaded him that he should despise this 
foolish and confused rule, and take a wife, and make 
Prussia a secular dominion, either a principality or a 
duchy. The same thing meant and advised Philip after 
me. He smiled at that time, but answered nothing. In the 
meantime, | see that the man liked the advice and that he 
wishes this to be put into practice as soon as possible. 
But this could be done most conveniently if the people of 
Prussia, together with their great ones, were led to 
besiege him with requests that he should undertake this 
very thing; then it would happen that he would have a 
necessary and completely sufficient cause for the work 
he desires. And for this, if | am not mistaken, Paul 
Speratus is also sent. Seeing then that a door is opened 
for the great and marvelous work of the Lord, by which 
also other poor bishops may be made an example.

who would like to be first and who do not dare to be first 
without an example: You see, of course, that it is your 
duty, together with Speratus and Amandus 3) and the 
other servants of the word, to guide and encourage the 
people to first call upon the hand of God, so that instead 
of this abominable principality, which is a kind of 
hermaphrodite, Instead of this abominable principality, 
which is a kind of hermaphrodite, neither layman nor 
monk (religiosus == religious), they wish and desire a 
principality of a right form, and, tired of fornication, urge 
the Master of the Order with common and united pleas 
that he take a lawful wife and make a right dominion out 
of this abomination. 

This persuasion of the people must, however, so that 
it is not too sudden and violent, first be attacked by 
suggesting and questioning, as with an established 
disputation sentence (themate), namely: after they see 
that this order is an abominable hypocrisy, it would be 
nice if the master of the order took a wife, and likewise 
the other lords, and with the consent of the people made 
the country a secular one. But after they had discussed 
and talked a little about this matter (themate), and the 
minds seemed to incline to this side, then the matter 
would be publicly pursued and promoted with ample 
reasons. | wish that the Bishop of Samland would have 
the desire to do the same, but since here one must 
proceed with caution, it would seem safer that he give 
himself the appearance of not yet having formed a 
judgment about the matter. ” Finally, however, if 


3) Johann Amandus, a Westphalian, had earlier come to 
Prussia as a preacher of indulgences; later he appears as a 
preacher of the gospel in Holstein, comes to Wittenberg chased 
out from there and, recommended by Luther, is sent to 
K6nigsberg in the fall of 1523 by Friedrich von Heideck. From 
there he was expelled because of his stormy nature (he was of 
Carlstadt's kind) in 1524. Then for a short time in Danzig, then in 
Stolpe, from where he had to flee because of iconoclasm; then 
again temporarily in Wittenberg, from where he came to Stettin 
and was imprisoned by the Catholic Duke George of Pomerania. 
Through Luther's use by the Elector he was freed again (see 
Luther's letter of April 26, 1526), then became a preacher in 
Goslar, where he died in 1530, also often hostile. 

4) In the next period, among others, the Comthur of Neydberg, 
Friedrich von Waldburg, and the Bishop of Samland, Georg von 
Polenz, took part in the advisory board.

the people agrees, and is overcome by the reasons, also 
its confirmation would follow. But Christ will give you 
mouth and wisdom in all these things, and understanding 
and insight to the people, so that you will be better 
instructed by the matter itself than by my precepts as to 
how to act here. 

| am editing the notes to your fifth book of Moses, 
attributed and dedicated to the Bishop of Samland, but 
being overwhelmed with business, | am slow in 
advancing the work. Commit me faithfully to his sincere 
grace and greet Amandus and all the brothers in the 
Lord. Live and prosper in Christ. Greetings to you from 
Philip and our prior, whom Satan recently tried to kill in 
the marketplace by hurling a tile from the roof, but the 
Lord surely preserved him in a miraculous way. One 
hears nothing yet from your treasure vulture. 2) Murnar 
with his own has taken off his habit and has left the 
monastery with all of them, since he has become, as 
some say, Canonicus regularis, or one who strives for 
a position in the monastery, but he still remains the same 
Murnar that he was. 

Be mindful, my dear Brismann, that you work faithfully 
for the establishment of boys' schools. For here Satan 
feels that he is being attacked, since he fears that the 
children will be snatched from him, and _ resists 
everywhere with incredible art. Therefore, | recommend 
to you this young man Johann Haddamir, 3) who is 
capable of taking care of these things. Wittenberg,

Jonas is coming to you, my dear Lang, while his wife 
is left here, close to her confinement, in order to take care 
of the sick brother, then also to take care of his own 
affairs. Therefore, he asks, and | ask, that you faithfully 
assist him in the matters in which he may be in need of 
you, so that he may be ready the sooner and be able to 
return home. You, who are now out of danger of poverty, 
know what it means to be in want or in need of money; 
perhaps Jonah also suffers from this disease, because 
he has taken a wife and has a household. As we now 
have confidence that you will do, so we pray that you may 
do. 

William's Nesen perished miserably in the water, to 
our great sorrow and to the great joy of the enemies, 
perhaps also to even greater blasphemy of our Gospel 
and the name of Christ. Satan would almost have killed 
our prior, too, if he had not been preserved by a glorious 
miracle. The Lord is near and far at the same time. 
Farewell and greet your rib. Wittenberg, Wednesday after

had given up their prebends, be provided from them, but that the 
income of the prebends be assigned to the university.

the three prebends of the three new canonries, given up 
by them, home again. But because they did this out of 
comforting confidence that C.F.G. would take such willing 
work in grace and let them enjoy it, so that they would not 
bring vain harm and disgrace from it, we are inspired by 
some, and also moved out of Christian duty ourselves, to 
ask C.F.G. for these canons. C. F. G. for the same 
canonries, that E. C. F. G. either from the same prebends 
and pensions, or shall, as E. C. F. G. knows how to mean, 
graciously provide for them. Also, because C. F. G. 
himself sees how schools and lessons are being allowed 
to disintegrate all over the world, and there is no one to 
take care of the arts, to the great ruin not only of the 
German country, but also of the whole of common 
Christendom, and God has sent E. C. F. G. a letter from 
the Holy Father. C. F. G. this grace before other princes, 
that it has almost alone grace and favor to preserve the 
Studia, which should be the noblest work of all princes: 
we humbly request and urge once again, E. C. F. G. may 
you have a gracious understanding of this university and 
direct the prebendary pension, which now has so much 
to do to praise God and to raise the dear youth, to proper 
lessons, so that this few Christian schools may remain a 
salutary example in the Schwang and the world, so that 
the gift of God, E. C. F. G. so mercifully given, may be the 
more richly put to work and bear fruit, for which it has 
been given, that E. C. F. G. may be praised before God 
and the world as father and patron of the poor abandoned 
youth in German lands. This Christ will undoubtedly 
recognize more abundantly with temporal and eternal 
grace, which E. C. F. G. may mercifully bestow upon him, 
Amen. At Wittenberg, on Friday Kiliani 1524.

(Regest.) 


The Elector rejects the request made in the previous number 
with regard to the three canons, because in accepting the office, 
even though it was based on 





mcrksam made, would have been obliged. He had committed the 
canons to read mass, but they did not do so afterwards. With 
regard to the transfer of the income of the prebendaries to the 
university, he is not yet decided; but if it should happen and the 
canons are sent to lection before others, he does not want to 
prevent them from receiving a provision through the university.

To the highly esteemed man, Magister Georg 
Spalatin, the servant of Christ, his [friend] in the 
Lord. 

Mercy and peace! Here comes Hans Lufft, my dear 
Spalatin, who will demand our money from Christoph von 
Bressen in our name, although there is little hope that we 
will achieve what is necessary. For | do not see how it 
could be possible for us to get rid of our debts, since it is 
already the third year in which he is supposed to pay us 
90 florins for the third time; but where can he get such a 
large sum? 

| am sending Osiander's letter: Capito's is not at hand. 
Satan has taken away the Nesen, while his three 
companions are miraculously preserved, so that he would 
not want to corrupt them as well. The Lord has grieved us 
greatly by this case and opened the mouths of the 
blasphemers, but he will turn this to his glory after the 
Amorites will be hardened and blinded by this weakness 
of his people Israel. Fare well and pray for me. 

You, too, work to ensure that the three canonists 
obtain another grace instead of this one. For it is unworthy 
and unjust.

There is a certain Johann Boldewan, to whom the 
pastor in Belzig (Peltitz) has given his parish, and he 
pleases the people. But the council refers the matter to 
the prince; if he should appoint him, they will take him all. 
Now he asks through me that this be obtained from the 
prince. However, he is a learned and good man, who in 
Pomerania has been cast out from his abbey 1) and has 
suffered many things in bonds for the sake of Christ. He 
is worthy that mall demand and set him up like this. | ask

1) Boldewan had been abbot of the Belbuck monastery near 
Treptow in Pomerania since 1517, joined Luther's teachings as 
early as 1520 or 1521, called Bugenhagen from Treptow to the 
monastery to teach theology in the Collegio he had founded, but 
was imprisoned by Duke Boguslaw in '1523 because of his 
evangelical sentiments, and when he was released, had to 
vacate the land. He then went to Wittenberg and received the 
parish in Belzig. In 1528 he was active for a time as pastor at St. 
Peter's with Bugenhagen in Hamburg in the introduction of the 
Gospel. His successor was Johann Aepinus on October 17, 
1529.

pe Wette, vol. Il, p. 534 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 

To the free convent virgins, my dear sisters in Christ, 

kindly written. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Savior! Dear Sisters, | 
have received your writings that time and that time, and 
have heard your request, and would have answered long 
ago, if | had been inspired and if there had been voices, 
for | have much to do otherwise. First of all, you have 
understood quite well that there are two reasons for 
leaving the monastic life and vows: one is where the law 
of man and monastic work are demanded by force, and 
the other is where the law of man and monastic work are 
demanded by force. 


If they do not let you go free, but want to burden your 
consciences with it, it is time to leave and let the 
monastery and everything go. If it is so with you that they 
do not want to let you go free of the monastery works, 
but force your consciences with it, then call your friends 
all, and let them help you out, and provide for you in their 
house (if the authorities want it) or elsewhere. If your 
friends or parents do not want to help you, let other good 
people help you, regardless of whether your parents 
should be angry about it, die or recover. For the salvation 
of souls and God's will should be above all, as Christ 
says: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is 
not worthy of me. But if the sisters want to leave you free, 
or at least let you read or hear the word of God, then you 
must remain in it, and do and keep the monastery work 
with them, just like spinning, cooking and the like, so that 
you do not put any trust in it. The other cause is the flesh: 
although in this the womenfolk are ashamed to confess 
it, yet Scripture and experience show that among many 
thousands there is not one to whom God gives grace to 
keep pure chastity, but a woman has not herself in the 
image. God created her body to be with a man, to bear 
children and to draw them, as the words clearly state in 
Genesis 1, and the members of the body, ordained by 
God Himself for this purpose. For as eating, drinking, 
sleeping and watching were created by God, so naturally 
He wills that man and woman should be married to each 
other; therefore this is sufficient, and no one should be 
ashamed of what God created him for and made him for, 
where it is, 1) that he does not have the great strange 
grace to go out and do what he finds himself created for. 
These things ye shall read and learn abundantly and 
sufficiently, when ye come forth, and hear right 
preaching. For | have now proved and demonstrated it 
superfluously in the book of monastic vows, 2) item, to 
avoid the doctrine of men, item, in the sermon on 
conjugal life, item, in the postilla, which, if you read, you 
will learn all things, there

be it confession 1) or other things, you will find instruction 
enough that it is much too long and not necessary to 
write, because | am sure you will move to the monastery 
if these two causes or one hits you, as you complain in 
the first. If it is the case that the monastery once comes 
to right freedom, then whoever has the grace and desire 
to do so can move in, just as now the Council of Bern in 
Switzerland has handed over the most famous 
monastery of Kénigfelden,”) and let go out freely, stay 
and move in whichever virgin wants to, and give her what 
they have brought in with them. Hereby God commands 
and prays for me. Given at Wittenberg, on the day of Sixti 
Martyris [Aug. 6] 1524.

That is why | ask E. G. first of all to grant me this. 

He reported to me how E. G., after the departure of 
her dear husband, was almost making an effort, 
especially with much divine service and good works, 
especially with masses and vigils, to do good to her soul, 
as she had shown her love and faithfulness to E. G. and 
well deserved it in her life; in addition, he asked that | turn 
to E. G. with writings. To whom | did not know how to 
refuse, considering that E. G.'s best is sought therein. So 
| now humbly ask E. G. to accept my admonition as good. 

And only then shall E. G. remember that Job 1:21 
says: "God has given, God has taken away; as it pleased 
the Lord, so it has been done." So shall E. G. also sing 
to your faithful dear God, who has given such a dear, 
faithful spouse to E. G., and now has taken her again. 
For she was his before he gave her; she was his when 
he gave her; she is still his after he has taken her, as we 
all are. Therefore, though it grieves us that he takes from 
us what is his, yet let the heart take higher comfort in his 
best will, more than in all his gifts. For how immeasurably 
better is God than all His gifts. So also here his will is 
better to keep than the very best and noblest4) woman. 
However, one cannot feel this like this, but faith feels 5) 
it. 

Therefore, E. G. God cheerfully gives His own, and 
accepts this rich exchange and immeasurable usury, that 
you now have for a tender, dear wife a tender, dear will 
of God, yes, in addition to God Himself. Oh, how blessed 
and rich we would be if we could make such a change 
with God! Yes, we could do it, if we understood it. For 
God meets us with it every day, but we cannot greet Him. 

On the other hand, Gn. Lord, my request is that Your 
Grace refrain from masses, vigils and daily prayers.

prayer for their souls. It is enough if God prays for them 
once or twice with earnestness, because God has 
promised us: "Whatever you ask, believe that you will 
have it, and you will surely have it" [John 15:7]. Otherwise, 
when such prayer is always urged for one thing, it is a sign 
that we do not believe God, and thus only enrage Him 
more with unbelieving prayer. For what is it different if | 
often ask for one thing, but so much that | have not been 
heard in the previous prayers, and thus have asked 
against His promise. One should always ask, it is true; but 
in faith, and always be sure that one is heard: otherwise 
the prayer is lost. So there is always something else and 
something else to ask for. 

In particular, however, | ask your Lord to refrain from 
the vigils and masses for the souls, for this is an 
unchristian thing that greatly angers God. For in the vigils 
one can see that there is neither earnestness nor faith, 
but only useless murmuring. Oh, it must be asked 
otherwise, if one is to obtain something from God. The 
work of such vigils is only God's mockery. In addition, 
because God has not instituted the Mass for the dead, but 
for the Sacrament for the living, it is a horrible, frightening 
thing that people approach and change God's institution," 
and make a work and sacrifice for the dead out of the 
Sacrament for the living. Let our Lord beware and not 
make himself a party to this abominable error, which the 
priests and monks have brought up for the sake of their 
bellies. For a Christian should do nothing unless he knows 
that God has so commanded. Now they have no 
commandment of such masses and vigils, but their own 
little bundle, which carries money and goods, and helps 
neither the dead nor the living. 

Further, E. G. can well find out about all this and report 
it to the above-mentioned Vincenz Wernsdorfer, who of 
course favors E. G. and has moved me to write about this. 
Please, let E. G. please her, and do not err in those who, 
without God's word, speak against her own deeds and 
human statutes. Christ enlightens and strengthens E. G. 
in the right way.

cities at a convention held at Speier and at one to be held

accept this mandate and others. At least the Landgrave 
of Hesse has given freedom to the Gospel by his last 
edict. The Count Palatine lets everything go, since he is 
dirty 3) and stalks the estates of the popes. The pope 
gave Ferdinand the third part of all ecclesiastical 
revenues in all his lands, so that he would be an enemy 
of the Lutherans, and he arouses the hatred of the priests 
against himself, who suffer this extremely unwillingly. It 
is said that he also gave the fourth part to the dukes of 
Bavaria, and the princes and bishops are so senseless 
that it seems that they no longer want to rule 4) or live, 
since the spirit of deceit that God has sent below compels 
them to do so. The bishop of Strasbourg summoned the 
council and ordered them to expel the evangelists 
(among whom four are outstanding, Martin Bucer, 
Fabricius Capito, Caspar Hedio, Matthias Zell, among 
others). The latter, however, promised that they would 
gladly carry out this commandment. By the way, they 
wanted to admonish him, 5) that he himself would leave 
the city within 24 hours with the whole clergy and the 
court and all his people, so that they would save their 
lives; if they would perish, they wanted to be excused. 
When the bishop heard this, he freely demanded a truce 
until the feast of Michaelmas. Since it had been planned 
at Augsburg to expel an evangelist, in a few

in front of the town hall and demanded that the cause of 
the expulsion be reported to them. When Fugger heard 
this, he was the first to flee secretly, followed by the entire 
clergy. Thus the whole town and even the council were in 
arms all day. Finally, on the next day, Fugger was 
admitted at his request and on acceptable conditions, 
and the people were pacified, but the clergy had not yet

Letters from the year 


To the highly esteemed man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, the 
faithful servant of Christ, his exceedingly dear 
[friend] in Christ. 

Grace and peace! | have sent the messenger you sent 
with the glasses back to you empty, my dear Spalatin. If 
you should send him again, then show at the same time 
from the blood of which kings he sprang, or what kind of 
kingdoms such a great man possesses, so that | know 
with what kind of latrine 1) | must honor such a 
commanding and imperial man. What is it necessary to 
ask for advice about the publication of the bull 2)? He is 
allowed to publish it wherever he wants; for even the bull 
does not require that he be defended by the princes. If 
they want to be ridiculed with their bulls, who prevents 
them? yes, we rather want to contribute to it. 

The Leimbach have demanded an answer. | have told 
them what | heard from you, namely that the prince has 
decreed that the matter should finally be brought to an 
end. | see that they are oppressed by lack, although they 
are righteous people. Especially the wife is excellent, and 
it is worthwhile that this service be rendered to her, also 
for the sake of the many children. Therefore, help them 
not to be abandoned like this, or to put the matter on the 
back burner. 

| hear that Melchior Lotther has also been badly 
reported to the prince; | ask you, what is it necessary that 
the afflicted be given new affliction? Let us finally spare 
him, he has enough punishment and misfortune. 
Therefore, be a good mediator, and if it is necessary that 
| write for him myself, | will do it gladly. 

| believe that you have read enough of the younger 
prince's tragedy at Orlaminde. 


1) Mockingly, Luther wrote /atrina (cloake, resignation) instead 
of /atria (worship). 
2) In 1524, Bishop Adolph of Merseburg carried out a visitation in 
the Chur Saxon lands, during which several pastors, priests and 
preachers were cited, deposed and banished, but his decrees 
were not obeyed (Férstemann, Neues Urkundenbuch, p. 109). 
Now, by showing a new papal bull, which he had sent to the 
Elector on Sept. 8, he appealed to the secular sword for help. The 
Elector refused.

because it cannot be written in a short letter. Carlstadt 
has finally fallen into a hardened mind, so that | despair 
of his return. He has always been far from the honor of 
Christ, and will perhaps always be so, for that is where 
the senseless desire for honor and praise has driven him. 
He is more hostile to me, or rather to us, than any enemy 
has ever been, so that | believe that this wretched man is 
not merely possessed by a devil. May God have mercy 
on his sin, with which he sins to death. Farewell and pray 
for me. Wittenberg, September 13, 1524.

| beg you for the sake of Christ, see to it that Melchior 
Lotther does not have such a bad reputation with the 
prince. You would not believe how frightened a man is 
because he has heard that he has been reported to the 
prince in the worst way. He is certainly a good man and 
has been punished more than enough for his offense. 
There is also some consideration to be given to his wife, 
who is a very good woman and should not be so troubled, 
since she is already troubled enough both by many 
children and by many debts. | beg you, obtain something 
with which | can comfort him. 


Philip, who has become obstinacy itself, refuses the 
theological lecture, and | (as you know) am 
overwhelmed, - but | am perhaps guilty of this for the 
monastery of which | am in use, - and the students

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear 
hervens! | have talked with my lords and doctors about 
your writing concerning adultery, and answer thus: 
Although according to the law of Most [Deut. 20, 10. 
Deut. 22, 22.] such were stoned, yet such law is not 
given, except to the Jews; and we, who are among the 
Gentiles and have Gentile authority, are obliged to keep 
and punish ourselves according to the same law. 
Although, unfortunately, the same law and rule lies 2) 
and is little in use. Therefore we in Wittenberg let the 
honorable council punish such with distemper to the city, 
as with lighter punishment, because the righteous does 
not go in the custom, which gives imperial law. May now 
E. W. follow the same Wittenbergers, or, so it loved, 
undertake the strict punishment 3) of the imperial law.

1) In Celle, on Luther's recommendation, Crusius became the 
successor of Wolf Cyklops from Zwickau, who since 1518 had 
been the personal physician of Henry the Middle, who had 
gathered a small Protestant community. Crusius was born in 
Braunschweig in 1499, entered the Aegidien Monastery of the 
Benedictine Order there as early as 1508, attended the 
University of Erfurt in 1518, Wittenberg in 1519, where he 
became Baccalaureus on Oct. 17, 1521. He then returned to his 
monastery, but was challenged for his evangelical convictions 
and transferred to Volkmeroda. Here he was to be attacked by 
Duke Henry of Brunswick on 17 March 1523, so he escaped to 
Hoya. Then he came to Celle around Easter 1524 and carried 
out the Reformation there with Heinrich Bock and Joh. Matthai. 

2) Margaretha, wife of Duke Henry the Middle, sister of Prince 
Frederick the Wise, turned to the Gospel only towards the end of 
her life. In 1524, she took her daughter out of the convent. She 
died in Weimar on Dec. 7, 1528.

On his question whether he should leave Jachymov because 
of a disgruntled trade, Luther advised him to stay.

To Nicolaus Hermann,” the godly and learned man in 

Joachimsthal, his [friend] in Christ. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! M. Stephan” has asked 
me for advice on your behalf, my dear Nicolaus, whether 
you should leave the valley after the deal and the matters 
have been settled. But | judge, since the Lord has 
already given you grace, that you have overcome the 
past case through patience, that you must persevere, 
especially since they are already showing themselves 
friendly, as you write, until you finally overcome 
everything. Who knows what God thinks about you or 
what he will do through you. You know the word of 
Solomon [Prov. 16:7]: "Ifa man's ways please the LORD, 
he also makes his enemies content with him." Overcome 
therefore evil with good, and make thyself and thy 
guarantors free by goodness, leaving off (as mau saith) 
stern justice and severity. | recommended you to Frau 
Hauptmann 5) when she was here; if you wish, you can 
remind her of my recommendation and make use of it; 
she seemed to me to be favorable to you and Stephan 
anyway. However, | have not only complained to her 
orally about the letter, which was forcibly and fraudulently 
stolen and published. 


3) Nic. Hermann, the poet and composer of several church 
hymns, took up the cantor's office in Jachymov in 1518 and died 
there on May 3, 1561. 

4) Stephan Noth, later town clerk in Zwickau, was Rector of 
the Latin school in Joachimsthal from 1520 to 1522. In the winter 
semester of 1523, he studied again in Wittenberg. 

5) In 1517 the Counts Schlick had appointed a mountain 
captain in Jachymov; this was Heinrich von K6nneritz from 1519 
to 1545, his wife Barbara, née von Breitenbach. Both were 
devoted to the evangelical doctrine.

To Gallus Czahera. *) 


Luther exhorts him to repent of his ungodly behavior, 
otherwise he will be subject to divine judgment. 


Printed by C. Héfler, Des Bartholomaus von St. Aegidius 
Chronik von Prag 2c., p. 108 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 49. The 
Bohemian translation in: Bartos Prager Chronik, edited by Erben, 
p. 124. 


Grace and peace in Christ! Although | think, dear 
Gallus, that my letter of exhortation will be too late and in 
vain to dissuade you from the undertaking you have 
begun, since you have long since ceased to conceal that 
with which, as you know, you have unduly deceived us, 
since you have publicly departed from the truth you have 
recognized. 


1) Czahera, the son of a butcher in Saaz, after his studies in 
Prague, first became a pastor in Leitmeritz, where he fell out with 
the congregation and then went to Wittenberg in 1523. Here he 
won Luther's trust and prompted him to write to the council and 
congregation of the city of Prague on how to order and appoint 
church servants (St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1548). After a three- 
month stay, he returned to Prague and was elected administrator 
by the Utraquist Estates on August 23 and became pastor of the 
church of Yours. At first he praised Luther in the pulpit, but since 
he did not succeed with his reformatory ideas, especially the 
abolition of celibacy, he turned to the opposite party, and, 
violently reviling Luther and persecuting his former friends, 
sought to bring about the rapprochement of the Utraquists with 
the Roman Church. His compatriot Palacky (V, 2, 515) passed 
judgment on him: "His whole conduct revealed in him such a 
degree of unworthiness as is seldom found in Bohemian history." 
The negotiations failed, however, although he assured the pope 
of his obedience. He remained in his position until 1529, but 
allowed himself many arbitrary acts until Ferdinand expelled him 
from the city and his hereditary lands on Sept. 5. He went to 
Nuremberg, but had to leave this city as well, because he went 
out against the preachers, and after he had married, he ended 
his life as a gift host in Ansbach. 


| have nevertheless wanted to try to show you one last 
friendship. Return, my dear Gallus, and come back as 
long as you have time; stop setting yourself against God 
and Christ; you are a man who has no time to live, and 
perhaps at this time, when you lie about these things and 
want to brood about others, your downfall will approach 
all the more quickly, and it will not be necessary to hasten 
it of your own free will. Servant of God, what do you have 
to do with wars, bloodshed and captures? My dear 
Gallus, do you not believe that Christ is also God, who 
looks upon you and will finally judge you? "It will be hard 
for you to lick against the sting" [Apost. 9, 5.], it is not 
easy to get over the voices of so many good people 
against you. If you will follow my words and obey me, | 
will rejoice over the newborn brother; but if you are 
obdurate and stubborn, you will throw your work 2) and 
your burden yourself, and | will be excused. But |, by 
God's gift and grace, will not conceal your works from the 
descendants. God change and convert you in a short 
time, amen.

Luther recommends D. Thomas Eschhaus in place of D. 
Stagmann, who intends to move away. 


1) Palacky calls him Martinach, pastor of Bethlehem Church. 
He was expelled from the city by Czahera and his followers after 
a bloody tumult at the election of the new council on Aug. 10, 
1524, along with others. On Aug. 22, 1524, Laurent. Campegius 
wrote to Sadolet from Vienna that he had heard from Prague that 
fifteen Lutheran priests had been expelled from there.

The Magister Georg Spalatin, the servant of Christ at 
the Court of Saxony, his superior in the Lord. 


Grace and peace! | would like you, my dear Spalatin, 
to take care of what | am writing to you now with your 
usual fidelity and care, | beg you for this most earnestly 
and urgently. Itis said that D. Stagmann is about to move 
away, either because he has been called elsewhere or 
because he cannot support himself on his salary, as is 
easy to believe. He is followed by D. Thomas Eschaus, 
aman who is already very old and who, due to an illness 
that has befallen him, has lost his audience. He begins 
to become seriously worried, having to beg at his age, 
which must be credited to the weakness of old age. Now, 
however, since he has rendered outstanding services to 
the Academy and has practiced the medical art quite 
happily before others, and is still the best and first among 
us, he is also forced by necessity to remain here, and 
especially for the practical art of medicine, which should 
be assigned to him, There is no doubt that he will be 
demanded and requested by the audience for this, if he 
should leave, that he, if he cannot do it in the college, at 
least lectures in his house to the whole number of 
students of this subject: He is worthy that we also ask for 
him, and you may faithfully strive that he, honored and 
supported by this grant, will be kept with us in an 
honorable manner until his end, which will perhaps come 
sooner than one thinks, especially since he does not ask 
for this in vain, and can repay it by creating benefits. 
Since | could not refuse him this service of intercession, 
| entrust it to your care, since | hope that you will do 
whatever you can. Fare well in Christ. Wittenberg, Friday

About an ecclesiastical matter in Kemberg. He complains about

To the godly and sincere man, Magister Georg 
Spalatin, the servant of Christ at the court of 
Saxony, his superior. 

Grace and peace! When you answer our Argula, my 
dear Spalatin, | ask you to send this letter of mine to her 
at the same time, because you can do what | cannot. 

| also commend the Kemberg matter to you. The small 
priest's office is for the most part arranged from the goods 
of the citizens; now that the masses have fallen away, 
they intend to turn this over to the common treasury and 
want to pay the salary of the schoolmaster from it. This is 
a godly thought, a holy and necessary work, that schools 
should be established, as you know. Now the cunning,” 
who, according to vicariate law (Vicario jure), alternate 
with the council of Kemberg in conferring the small 
priest's position, is resisting. But they have given it to a 
certain person who otherwise already holds three 
parishes, 


1) Listani, that is, Christoph and Heinrich List, provosts of 
Rakith. Christoph was provost of Kemberg in 1500.

then does not live there, nor does he do anything, except 
that he does not consume the income, either by right or 
by necessity, while leaving the work to be done that can 
be supported with it, especially since it is the property of 
the citizens. Therefore do what you can, and prosper in 
the Lord. 

Those at Leisnig will finally drive out the Tilemann 2) 
through hunger. The good man complains very much; 
why does the prince stand still there? 3) But we may 
believe that after such examples good men will give up 
their pastorate, who will be left like this afterwards; or will 
they not rather be driven into the monasteries again? | 
am very much troubled by this exceedingly evil example, 
which, as it is the first, should also have been the best.

To Spalatin. 

Luther complains about a vehement letter from Spalatin in 
which he has wronged Jonas. In this way, he fears, he and Jonas 
will be forced to leave. The matter concerns the abolition of the 
mass in the monastery, against which the Dean Beskau, Georg 
Einer von Staffelstein and Johann Volmar from Billingen, canons, 
sat down and slandered Jonas.

and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 74. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 932. 


2) Tilemann Schnabel, Augustinian, was already Luther's 
"schoolboy" in the Erfurt monastery, in 1512 in Wittenberg, on 
Oct. 4, Baccalaureus. Under Luther's decanate he received his 
doctorate on Sept. 9, 1515, became a provincial in 1520 as 
Gerhard Hecker's successor, and preached the gospel in Alsfeld 
even before Landgrave Philip of Hesse was won over. When the 
latter forbade him to preach, he went back to Wittenberg in 1523. 
In 1526 he followed the call of the people of Alsfeld, whom the 
landgrave had allowed to ask for a reprieve because of their 
faithful service in the Peasants' War. He remained in Alsfeld until 
his death in 1559. 

3) The Elector had still not confirmed the order of the common 
caste at Leisnig, but did so only in 1529. The council withheld the 
income from the common caste and the preachers were not paid. 

4) The opinion is: as the order of the common chest in Leisnig 
is the first of its kind, by which the church foundations were put 
into the service of the Gospel and the poor, so it should also have 
been executed in the best way.

Grace and peace! About your asking me for advice, 
my dear Spalatin, whether you should leave the court 
and your office, 1) this is my opinion. It is certainly a 
significant cause if the word is not heard, as the wise man 
says [Sir. 32, 6. Vulg.]: "Where there is no hearing, do 
not throw away your speech." But if some hear, there is 
no need to desist, or I, too, would have been silent long 
ago in the face of so great a contempt for the word. If, 
therefore, there is no other cause for you which weighs 
on your conscience, it is not enough for you to leave your 
place or your profession or to do anything for the sake of 
it. For if marriage did not drive you away from this place, 
| could not even think of any cause that should move you. 
But since you now know the court completely from 
experience and can be of use to many at the prince's: if 
a newcomer enters, what will he be able to do before he 
gets to know this court? Even if everything is done in the 
same way, when will it happen that he will gain such great 
confidence and such a high opinion from the prince as 
you have, and which is brought about by long trial? So 
either stay, or, if you leave, you may go, because the 
need of marriage compels you. Perhaps, however, you 
are afraid to cite this cause, and instead of it you would 
like to use another as a reason. 


1) The people at court found fault with Spalatin in many ways, 
as he wrote to Warbeck on Sept. 24: to some he was not tall 
enough in stature, to others not strong enough; he did not have 
a pleasant voice, was not short enough in speaking 2c. 
Furthermore, Seckendorf reports, Hist. Luth. lib. |, p. 314, add. Il, 
that Spalatin wrote to the Elector on Nov. 25, requesting that he 
be dismissed from the office of a preacher at court and given 
permission to marry, because "he could no longer stand the 
unpleasantness in his conscience. The name of Spalatin's 
chosen one was Catharina Heidenreich. The Elector will have 
given his answer orally. Through his request, Spalatin did not fall 
out of favor with the prince, but the wedding was postponed until 
the following year and was not consummated until after the 
prince's death. Then Spalatin also left the court and became the 
successor of Wenc. Link in Altenburg. 





| don't see what use that could be, since it must finally be 
given by the deed itself all day long, if you do it. 
| thank Argula for writing to me about taking a wife, 
and | am not surprised that such things are gossiped 
about me, since many other things are also gossiped 
about. But you thank her on my behalf and say that | am

Grace and peace! It is certain that you have become 
1) even a Crésus, such an evangelist, who has 
converted all at once, my dear Amsdorf, how else would 
it be possible that you would be so proud and write to us 
so seldom. But we don't begrudge you having something 
to be proud of; we have nothing but such things to be 
humbled by. For Carlstadt's poison creeps around far 
and wide, Zwingli at Zurich and Leo Juda (Judaeus)

brothers are not treated so fraudulently among you. It 
was determined in my presence 2) that those who 
wanted to leave would be given a small sum so that they 
would not go out empty-handed, about which they will 
report to you themselves. Now both the council and the

We finally got our canons to agree that the masses 
should be abolished. *) Now this house of abominations

with the council about the conditions under which the monastery 
should be handed over. Only on November 6, 1525, the monks 
left the monastery and handed it over, after it was determined 
that the income should be used for charitable purposes.

Grace and peace! About leaving the preaching 
ministry, my dear Spalatin, | still have no other opinion 
than before. For your reason does not satisfy me that 
others are more knowledgeable in languages or adorned 
with greater gifts. | know of none, unless you want even 
Philip or Pomeranian or Jonas to be your successor; | 
have none in all our company whom | could prefer to you. 
But see to it that it be not a temptation which afterward, 
when thou hast resigned, deceiveth thee with 
irremediable repentance; Satan is a mischievous man. 
Therefore | counsel thee even more now to persevere, 
that the spirit may be tested, whether it be of God, or 
whether thou be tempted. For why do you want to leave 
the prince, who is perhaps very close to the grave, and 
disturb his last days with a new minister? For if, on your 
resignation, it should happen that he should soon pass 
away, you would always suffer for not having persevered 
until that time. That is my opinion, therefore take it to the 
best. Farewell. Wittenberg, Monday after Nicolai [Dec.

this year. G. has given us some grain this year through 
the locksmith; now the locksmith reminds us strictly every 
day, and we still cannot pay it, because our interest is not 
falling, nor has it fallen so far: for this reason, we humbly’ 
request that E. churfl. G. will absolve us of the same grain 
at the aforementioned locker for the last time. For | trust 
and hope that it will no longer be necessary. 

Also, most gracious Lord, because | am now alone in 
this monastery with the prior (because of Christian love 
we keep with us some who have been driven out [by the 
enemies of the Gospel]), and | have now kept the same 
prior longer than a year to serve me, which length | cannot 
nor will not endure, because his conscience demands of 
him to change his life; 1) to the fact that it will not do with 
me to have such misery daily, with the interest to be 
collected: we are minded, Ew. churfl. Gn. the monastery 
with all that belongs to it, as the youngest heir. For where 
the prior leaves, my work is no longer there, | must and 
will see where God feeds me. 

But so that we, as the last ones, do not leave so much 
as bare-handed, | humbly ask that Your Eminence, the 
Holy Father, will graciously grant and let occupy either the 
same prior or me in my name. Your Grace will either 
graciously grant to the same prior or to me in my name 
and let us occupy the space that our monastery has 
purchased next to the hospital tower 2) for N. florins. Not 
that | want to receive a public favor or writing from E. 
churfl. Not that | want to have a public favor or writing for

want to refer to E. churfl. Gn. as a means of acquiring 
future favor and leave. However, God will also advise a 
public favor. 

Such a request is forced upon me by guilt and love, 
because the prior must do without his paternal 
inheritance, which lies under the bishop of Trier, for the 
sake of the pursuit of the Gospel, in which he would 
otherwise be rich enough. May the grace of God protect

recommended to me by Hector Pomer (Behemo), the

To the man of proven godliness and faithfulness, Mr. 
Georg Spalatin, court evangelist to the Elector of 
Saxony, his [friend] in the Lord. 


Mercy and peace! If | did not respect or despise friends 
or friendship, | would not have written to you so freely, nor 
would | have poured out the suspicions of my heart into 
your bosom, but would have eaten them into myself. 
Therefore, you wrongly interpret the proof of my trust and 
friendship towards you as the opposite. Even hypocrites 
are not in the habit of revealing their suspicions to those 
of whom they know that they are sincere. By the way, the 
reason for my suspicion was the manner of this court, 
then also the monstrosity that was shown in the idol's 
house with us, because | know the prince's mind, since 
he does not care if one lets the interest go, and everyone 
goes his own way. | cannot doubt that among their 
number are also those who, having left the orders of the 
monastery, [still] consume something. 





[want]. ' In addition, we have still not received the interest 
on our many requests. In the past year Christoph Bressen 
has paid nothing, 2) and still owes the whole, namely 90 
guilders. 3)... Likewise, St. Martin's Day 4) has arrived. 
Meanwhile we live full of debts and pay with it. 5) This 
way of living cannot last long. Shouldn't this hesitation of 
the prince rightly arouse suspicion? | would certainly 
have left the monastery long ago and turned elsewhere 
to live from my work (although | do not live without work 
here either), if the shame of the Gospel and even of the 
prince had not kept me, so that malt could not say that | 
was expelled and the enemies of godliness could rejoice 
in what they hope for. For my change could not happen 
without a great stir. Therefore | would like nothing better 
than to know whether we have to torment ourselves in 
such a way or not, although | wish this in vain. But | will 
not be burdened further with requests, and the Lord will 
give what may be necessary. 1524.

To Georg Spalatin, the man of God and servant of 

Christ, his friend in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! The sermon of StrauB pleases me 
more than his booklet before, because he has softened 
this point that one must also pay usurious interest. The 
only thing missing is that he condemns the interest of 
repurchase without distinction as usurious; for if they 
were brought into proper order (although they are 
abused everywhere), they could not be censured. 

Bressen has paid 120 florins, which have been used 
almost entirely for debts; there are still 60 in arrears, of 
which we have forgiven him thirty, because of his 
exceedingly great complaint that it is difficult for him to 
pay 6 per 100, although this is not our fault, but that of 
those who have ruined that estate, from which one could 
have taken more than 6 per 100, or it could have been 
sold for hundreds more. But he also got into this trouble 
without any fault. We would rather suffer this double 
damage than he would suffer the single one. Finally, he 
asked me to ask the prince to allow him to pay 5 per 100 
forever, which we will do in due time. Farewell and pray 
for me.

do not correspond to each other, *) the dating of the letter would 
be a conspicuous one. The only Monday that was left after the 
letter No. 800 is December 26, and Luther has hardly called the 
second Christmas day simply a Monday, also he would have 
written then probably, according to the custom of that time to 
begin the new year with Christmas Day, already in 1525". 

3) This writing is probably to be moved to the time before 
Pentecost, because Jakob Probst was present, who left 
Wittenberg around this time. 

4) This time determination, which is found in the editions, is 
not permissible, because Gilden married in 1524 (as the 
previous document shows), but here it speaks of his wife and 
children. We assume that this letter is to be placed after Luther's 
letter addressed to Aureus on June 25, 1535. Cf. no. 583, note.

Luther is said to have written this warning against trusting in 
the saints in a copy of Carlstadt's book: "Ein Frage ob auch 
jemand mége selig werden ohn die Furbitt Maria 1524" and 
addressed it to Urban Rhegius in Augsburg. Doubts about the 
authenticity of this document have been expressed several times, 
so by Uhlhorn, "Rhegius", p. 85, and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 99. 
"Luther's name," says Masch, "has stood at the end of the first 
letter, but the hand of the bookbinder has left only a few traces of 
it." On this the Erl. Briefw.: "From these ‘features’ Luther's name 
will probably only be guessed. Masch also provides no evidence 
that the letter was addressed to Urban Rhegius." However, we 
also share this letter, despite all justified doubts.

(On the back of the first sheet:) 


Dear Mr. Urban, | beg you to read this present sermon 
diligently for my sake and also for your instruction, so that 
you may later turn completely from the departed saints to 
Christ, who alone is our mediator, consolation and 
salvation, in whose name alone all believing people must 
be saved. Non enim est aliud nomen sub sole, in 
quo nos oporteat salvos fieri. Neither Mary, nor John, 
nor Peter, nor Franciscus, nor Benedictus helps here. 
It is the only Christ who remains, who is the cornerstone 
and foundation of our salvation. Fundamentum aliud 
nemo potest ponere praeter id quod positum est, 
quod est Christus Jesus. Therefore, | ask you to stay 
with your conscience and let go of what is uncertain. 
Saints to, saints to, we are all saints in Christ, if we 
believe otherwise. For 





In Christ nothing can be unclean or unholy; all things are 
sanctified through him. He will not be alone; for he 
speaks through the prophet: Honorem meum alii non 
dabo. Do now what is dear to you. Farewell. 


Mart. Luther. 
(At the end:) 


How now, dear sir, do you not think he has hit it? 
Therefore, be careful not to make an idol for yourselves. 
Take care that you do not rely on the prayers of others, 
much less on the saints who have died. For tempus 
acceptum is over with him. So it is written 2. aad 
Corinth: Tempore accepto audivi te. And Paul 
admonishes us not to let the grace of God fall away.

Grace and peace in the Lord! | answer late, my dear 
Brismann, through the fault of the messengers, but even 
this one almost passed by. Carlstadt, who is completely 
given over to the devils, rages against us with many 
published books, which are full of poison of death and 
hell. He denies that the Sacrament is the Body and Blood 
of Christ, to which | now reply, 1) although he has 
deceived many of the common people with hidden plots 
in various places.

have Carlstadt's spirit. In Ditmarschen, our Heinrich, the 
evangelist at Bremen, was killed and burned with cruel 
fury. Deuteronomy 3) is held up by the wickedness of 
these prophets. Apart from that, everything goes its usual 
course. We gladly accepted Peter Weller, 4) who is 
recommended to us. Thomas MUunzer wanders around 
and is uncertain where he should stay. In Mulhouse he 
had caused a great and dangerous uproar. Several other 
prophets are also rising up, so that those who are faithful 
may be proven. The papists are happy about our disunity. 
But God will find Carlstadt in his time, who | believe is 
sinning to death. For it seems that, despairing of the 
kingdom of Christ, he has given himself up to it, that he 
also wants to corrupt as many as possible against the 
known truth and hurry to hell with a great multitude with 
will and knowledge, as some once heard something like 
that from his mouth. You pray for us and respectfully

To Georg Spalatin, the servant of Christ, evangelist 
at the court of Saxony, his extremely dear [friend] 
in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | am finally sending you 
back the Urban Rhegius 1) with the letter of Matthes 
Busch (Matthaei Puschil). | have added a letter to 
Hartmann Jbach 2) (Hypachium) which you can easily 
send to him; | have no messenger. Jodocus 3) Kern has 
gone to Alstadt, also recommended by me through 
letters, and will not return yet; what he may do or suffer, 
| do not know. 


Friends write to me from Basel that Carlstadt's 
printers have been punished there with imprisonment, 
and it would have been little missing that his books would 
have been burned; he had been there himself, but 
secretly. But they write that they agree with his opinion, 
Oecolampad and Pellican, Annemundus Coctus 4) but so 
stubborn that he threatens me that if | do not depart from 
my opinion, he will write against me. Behold the 
monstrosities of Satan. But, as far as | understand, they 
are not caught by his reasons of proof, but by their own 
sense; because they have before already thought the 
thing so themselves, they now dare to come forth more 
freely, having obtained an author of their opinion, and a 
guide. Christ upholds me and all those who are his. Just 
as | am not caught by his evidence, but rather 
strengthened, so | am not stuck in that error by my own 
opinion, even though | have been strongly challenged. It 
is certain that our opinion is the true one, even if I, or that 
one, or all of them fall away. Fare well and pray for me.

him to keep his own from rioting and unrest. This is

you and ours, then also the bishop gets the opportunity 
to do something with greater activity, who is otherwise 
not hostile to the Gospel. There is a Polish Jew here with

No. 810. 
Orlamiinde. January 18, 1525. 
Caspar Glatz, preacher in Orlaminde, to Luther. 


(Regest.). 

Glatz reported to Luther about the situation of his enthusiasts 
in Orlamtnde and the deceptions Carlstadt had used to seduce 
the people. Luther's writings on the Sacrament and the heavenly 
prophets were treated extremely shamefully, for they said that 
everything in them was written against the Son of Nazareth. 
They did not want to hear about baptism, sacrament and 
obedience to the authorities. Shortly after Luther's departure 
from Kahla (where he was on Aug. 23, 1524), Carlstadt had 
preached that Luther was not faithfully using his pound, given to 
him by God; he was pushing the gospel under the bench and 
perverting the Scriptures as he saw fit. The spirit of which 
Carlstadt pretended that he had it with him was his chaplain, a 
monk, a bad boy. He had caused all kinds of hauntings by 
throwing stones, boards, etc. in the house. Then Carlstadt said 
(among other big lies): Luther's teachings were not from God, 
therefore one should beware of them, as the spirit says, as of a 
pestilence. Often this spirit hid itself in the church and rang at 
unusual times with the big bell. Carlstadt, asked by the people 
what this meant, then answered: "the spirit can have no rest, 
unless the images, altar, sermon seat, baptismal font, sacrament 
are even taken away and burned to powder". Carlstadt also 
translated several psalms from Hebrew (in the most miserable 
way) and taught the people to sing them in German.

To the man of God, Mr. Georg Spalatin, the servant 
of Christ at the court of Suchsen, his dearest 
[friend] irr dem HErrn. 

Grace and peace to your Lord! | have answered that 
Swabian nothing, will also not answer. That the Lord 
created the heavens and the earth in six different days, 
Genesis 1, as the text itself reads, | have taught and 
kept, and the transcripts of some from my mouth are 
available; then that the serpent was a real serpent, 
through which Satan spoke, using it as a tool. For one 
must not do violence to the revealed words of Moses 
without cause. Rebecca undoubtedly, according to that 
ancient custom, asked the Lord for counsel in Shem the 
high priest, or one of the fathers of that time, who was in 
charge of the service, who was full of the spirit. Thus the 
Lord also spoke to Cain through a priest who was in 
charge of the sacrificers, namely through his father 
Adam, just as Christas Matth. 19 [v. 5] says that God 
said: "They will be one flesh", while Adam said this in 
Gen. 2, 24. This custom was later transferred under 
Moses to the mercy seat and the prophets and the 
publicly appointed priests, therefore they are called 
Elohim, that is gods, because they answer the word of 
God. But in the New Testament every Christian is such 
a one. 

| am sending the letter that was sent to me from 
Austria. Our Joachim 2) writes that Carlstadt has gone to 
Nordlingen, likewise that a child with a lion's head was 
born in Bamberg, which soon died. Some crosses have 
also appeared over the city, but the rumor is suppressed 
by the priests. Farewell and pray for me. Wittenberg,

will have compiled the story of the martyrdom of Heinrich von 
Zutphen according to information that he received from Jakob 
Probst in Bremen, and which is probably based on information 
from the priest Boye (because only a resident there could report 
the details except for the names), of which, however, the letter 
that Probst sent to Luther at the end of 1524 contains only an 
infinitesimal part. It was originally written to the Augustinians in 
Antwerp, but because the messenger had left without taking the 
letter with him, he sent it to Luther and added the request that 
Luther comfort them with a letter addressed to the whole church 
in Bremen. Luther complied with this request by the present 
writing. Probst's letter is printed in Erl. The history contained 
therein takes up not quite one and a half pages, the one given by 
Lnther, however, ten whole folio pages in the Jena edition. 
Therefore, we did not consider it necessary to include Probst's 
letter. 


Martinus Luther, Ecclesiastes zu Wittenberg, allen 
lieben GOttes auserwahlten Freunden in Christo 
zu Bremen. . 


Grace and peace from God our Father and Lord 
Jesus Christ. Dearest in Christ! | have not let the story 
and torture of the blessed Brother Henry of Sudphen, 
your evangelist, which | have had investigated and 
actually experienced through trustworthy pious people, 
lie hidden in darkness or doubt, but have intended to 
bring it to light in praise and honor of the divine graces, 
which at this time are so abundantly given to us who are 
damned, lost and unworthy, lost and unworthy, that we 
not only have, hear and read the clear Word of God, and 
also see it rising in many places like the bright sun, but 
also feel and sense the Spirit of God beside it with 
powerful and mighty deeds that prove and confirm His 
Word as He has cultivated it from the beginning. 
Especially in that he makes such courageous and free 
hearts that both, preachers and hearers, in many places 
make the number of the saints daily more and greater, 
since some shed their blood, some are imprisoned, 
some are driven from their homes, and all of them bear 
the reproach of the cross of Christ, and now come back 
is the form of a right Christian life, which with suffering 
and persecution is horrible to look at in the eyes of the 
world, but delicious and precious in the eyes of God, like 
the Psalter. Psalter [Ps. 116, 15] says: "Delightful in the 
sight of the Lord is death. 


Letters from the year 1525. No. 814.

of his saints," and again Ps. 72:14: "Their blood is 
precious in his sight." 

Among them, of course, your Henricus Sudphen 
shines the brightest, who suffered such a? shameful 
torture for the sake of God's word in Diedmar, and so 
powerfully confirmed the Gospel with his blood. Although 
the two, John and Henricus in Brussels, 1) the first, also 
became two fine lights, by such beautiful deaths, in which 
they were sacrificed to God for the sacrifice of a foot 
odor. Here also belongs Caspar Tauber, burned in 
Vienna, and Georg 2) Buchfiihrer in Hungary. And now 
recently, when | am reporting, at Prague in Bohemia one 
was burned because he left his order of impure chastity 
and entered the divine marriage state and order of pure 
chastity. These and their like are the ones who will drown 
the papacy and its god, the devil, with their blood. They 
are also the ones who will keep the word of God against 
the impure defilers, the new false prophets, who are now 
stirring up and tearing themselves down everywhere, 
pure and loud. For God, by grace and without doubt, 
allows them to die and shed their blood at this time, when 
all kinds of error and corruption are rising up, so that He 
may warn us and testify through them that this is the right 
doctrine, since the right spirit will be given within, which 
they have taught, kept, died over, and testified to with 
their torture; just as in the past the holy martyrs died for 
the sake of the gospel, and sealed it to us with their blood 
and made it certain. 

Such glory has never been enjoyed by those who 
have taught and seduced the world with works, human 
righteousness and free will. For the sake of such 
teaching the devil kills no one, can suffer them well, yes, 
gives them great wealth, honor and power of this world, 
so that they have peace and lead a sweet life. And even 
if they die, they are not God's martyrs, but their own and 
the devil's, just as the pagans are for the time being.

For even though he allows us to be challenged and 
some to be killed, he protects them spiritually so that 
they will be courageous and not fear death, but 
overcome it. He also keeps us from all perishing, as the

forever and increases.

This is a great defiance and comfort that God 
promises us that He will not abandon those who ask for 
Him, that is, those who have His word, in which His name 
is recognized and praised, not our deeds or name, as the 
works saints do. 


V. 11: Praise the Lord who dwells in 
Zion, proclaim his deeds among the people. 

That is, only seek and praise his name, and preach 
his word, and he will in turn seek and praise you, as 
follows: 


V. 12: For he remembers and asks for 
their blood; he does not forget the cry of 
the poor. 

He causes them to be killed and blood to be shed, as 
if he had forgotten them; but he remembers them 
powerfully and causes their blood to be smelled, so that 
the faithful become more and more, and the wicked less 
and less, the more they shed blood. 


V. 13. Be merciful to me, O Lord, behold 
my misery among the enemies, who lift me 
up to the gates of death. 

That is, continue as thou hast begun, and keep on 
helping, that through death we may become more. For 
thy way is to help out of the gates of death, that is, out of 
the power of them that kill, and to subdue them. 


V. 14 That I may tell all thy glory in the 
gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may 
rejoice in thy salvation. 

That the more you help, the more | have to praise you, 
so that your name and glory may be greater and greater 
among the faithful, as follows: 


V. 15: The Gentiles are sunk in the pit 
they have made, their foot is caught in the 
net they have set. 

That is, with their killing and persecuting, they are 
killing themselves and killing themselves. For God makes 
His word stronger by this, so that it converts more people 
than otherwise.

The builders 1) and rulers of the same parish demanded 
that Henricus preach and reproach them with the 
complaint of the chapter along with all the priesthood. 
The builders of the parish answered that they knew of no 
other way than that they had accepted a pious, learned 
preacher who taught them the word of God purely and 
loudly. But if the chapter or anyone, small or great, could 
prove that he had taught or preached something against 
the word of God, or otherwise heresy, they would not 
suffer or hold him in any way, but would help to persecute 
him together with the chapter. If, however, the lords of 
the chapter and other clergy could not bring anything 
upon him that he had taught against God's word, and 
intended to force him out without any guilt, they would 
not suffer this in any way. For this reason, they asked an 
honorable councilor with all humility not to encourage 
them to do so, but to let them do what was right; they 
would also be inclined to keep their preacher right at all 
times. Such an answer was sent by an honorable council 
to the chapter through their envoys. But when the clergy 
noticed that they could not achieve anything with good 
words, they began to be angry and angry, and from hour 
to hour they ran to their bishop 2) and showed him how 
the people of Bremen had become heretics, did not want 
to be obedient to the clergy, with many complaints, as it 
was to be feared that the whole city would be seduced. 

Then the bishop sent two of his councilors to Bremen 
and asked them to send the monk to him. 3) But when 
they asked why he should be sent to Bremen, they 
answered: he preaches against the holy church. But 
when they asked for what reason they should send him, 
they answered: he preaches against the holy church. If 
someone asked: in what and what articles? they did not 
know how to answer. Among them was the suffragan 
bishop of the Order of Preachers, who made every effort 
to catch the pious Henricum, fearing that his craft would 
perish. Finally they were answered by an honorable 
council: According to 


1) The church builders Heinrich, Esch and Arend Wittelob. 
both at the same time Rathsherren. Iken, p. 50. 

2) Archbishop Christoph (1511-1558), from the Brunswick - 
LUneburg house of princes, who at that time stayed in his 
episcopal city of Verben. 

3) That is, to solicit, desire, demand. Latin: postulans. 


If the preacher, accepted by them, would not be 
overcome by any scripture, and also no one could 
indicate any article in which he preached unjustly, they 
would not be able to bring about in any way with their 
citizens that the citizens would let him follow. Therefore, 
it would be their humble request that the bishop, their 
gracious lord, 4) procure his scholars to Bremen to 
debate with their preacher. If he would be found wrong, 
they wanted to get the preacher away with quite a 
punishment; but if not, they would not know how to leave 
him. But the suffragan bishop answered and asked most 
earnestly, for the sake of the peace of a whole country, 
that the preacher be handed over to him, and protested 
most earnestly, as he sought nothing else but the 
salvation of their souls; but he could accomplish nothing, 
for the people of Bremen persisted in their first answer. 
Because of this, the suffragan bishop was angry and 
departed from Bremen, and out of great anger, he did not 
want to fermelize the heretics' children. When the 
suffragan bishop returned to his lord, he showed him this 
answer and what he had heard from the priests and 
monks. After that, as new newspapers came daily, 
showing how the preacher was preaching angrier and 
angrier against the clergy, they found another council, 
and sent excellent people to warn the people of Bremen 
about the damage the city would suffer because of the 
preacher, since he was preaching against papal holiness 
and imperial majesty's command; they also showed how 
he was a prisoner of Frauen Margrethen, which would 
cause them great damage. They also brought urging 
letters from Frauen Margrethen, that she demanded her 
prisoner; but all this did not help her. For an honorable 
wise council always gave an answer in writing and orally 
to everyone. Then the bishop and his group devised 
another council to muffle the word of God, and held a 
provincial council, not at Bremen, as is customary, but at 
Buxstede, 5) so that they would have room to act with 
Brother Henrico as they wished. For this purpose 


4) Thus the Jenaer. Erlanger: "wallt inrer gnadiger Herre seine" 
2G: 
5) That is, at Buxtehude. It took place on March 10, 1523. 


698 


The prelates and scholars of the entire diocese were 
called upon to act on what they believed and held to be 
true. 

The preacher was also called to the council, but with 
the difference that they wanted to proceed with and 
against him as with a heretic, since he was unconquered 
and unheard. For this reason, the rulers, together with a 
whole congregation, kept their preacher with them, 
because their wickedness was in the day. But Brother 
Henry summarized his sermon, what he taught and 
believed, in short articles, and sent them in a letter to the 
archbishop, and showed his innocence, along with the 
articles, and offered, where he was mistaken, that he 
could be shown from Scripture to desist from such error 
and to recant. But he should be shown his error from the 
Scriptures, because he would know how to prove his 
teaching or preaching from the Scriptures 1). But such an 
offer, together with the articles, was despised, for he 
received no answer. What the verdict was, however, may 
be seen from this: for immediately thereafter they had the 
Pope's Leonis of the tithe, together with the imperial 
mandate, written at Worms, proclaimed and posted. 
Therefore, the pious preacher always continued his 
sermon and did not cease; besides, he always stipulated 
that he wanted and would be ready to give everyone an 
answer to his doctrine and sermon. The _ papists, 
however, had no peace, and daily sent their chaplains 
into the sermon to catch him in his words. But God 
showed His wonders and converted some of them, so 
that most of the chaplains they sent there confessed that 
such teaching and preaching was the truth and from God, 
which no one could resist, because they had not heard 
such teaching from any man all their lives. Therefore, 
they should renounce their evil and not pursue the word 
of God, but believe that they would be saved. But their 
wickedness had blinded them and hardened them with 
Pharaoh, so that they became worse according to their 
merit. To this day, no one of all the monks has been able 
to raise a word, 2) even though they daily cry out heresy, 
heresy, and are still unable to do so.

Since God Almighty saw the time that the good 
Henricus should testify with his blood to the truth 
preached by him, he sent him among the murderers 
whom he had prepared for this purpose. For it happened 
in the 24th year of small number 3) after Christ's birth that 
he was called by Nicolao Boye, pastor, and other devout 
Christians of the same parish at Meldorf in Diedmar, to 
proclaim the word of God to them, and to bring them out 
of the Antichrist's night, for he ruled mightily there, which 
calling he accepted as from God, and for this reason 
promised them that he would come to them. After that, 
on St. Catharine's Eve [Nov. 24. 1524], he summoned six 
pious confreres and citizens, told them how he had been 
called to Diedmar, and indicated to them that, since he 
was not alone obliged to proclaim the word of God to 
them alone, but to anyone who desired it, he intended to 
go to Diedmar and wait to see what God would do with 
him; Therefore, he asked them to give him good advice 
on how he could most easily get there, so that the whole 
community would not become aware of it and would not 
prevent his journey, as had happened. The devout 
Christians answered and asked that he stay with them 
and see how the gospel was still almost weak among the 
people, especially in the surrounding towns, and the 
persecution was still great, and see that he was called by 
them to preach the word of God. But if the people of 
Diedmar wanted a preacher, he sent another one there, 
because they knew what kind of people the people of 
Diedmar were. They also told him that they would not let 
him go without the consent of the whole parish. 

Good Henry answered: although he knew that he had 
been called by them, they would otherwise have enough 
pious, learned people to preach to them. The papists 
would also be partly overcome, so that henceforth 
women and children would see and judge their 
foolishness. | had also preached to them for two years; 
but the people of Diedmar had no [preacher], so he could 
not refuse them such a request with a clear conscience. 
That they

omitting the larger number of centuries.

but that they could not leave him without the knowledge 
and will of a whole congregation, did not conclude 
anything with him, because he did not want to leave them 
altogether, because he intended to preach in Diedmar 
only for a short time, namely a month or two, as long as 
he himself laid a foundation orally, and then to come to 
them again. Therefore, his opinion and request would be 
that after his departure they would inform the 
congregation of his profession, which he could not resist, 
and at the same time excuse his secret departure, 
because he would have to go secretly for the sake of his 
enemies, who would want to harm him, who were striving 
day and night, as they themselves well knew how they 
would kill and slay him, and also indicated how he would 
soon be with them again. With these words he satisfied 
them that they would allow him to go, because they 
hoped that the people of Diedmar would come to the right 
knowledge of the word of God, who otherwise are almost 
burdened with idolatry before other people. 

After that, on Monday of the first week in Advent [Nov. 
28,') 1524], Henricus went through the middle of the 
monastery of Bremen in Diedmar, and came to Meldorf, 
where he was called, and where he was received with 
great joy by the pastor and other pious Christians. As 
soon as he arrived, although he had not yet preached a 
sermon, the devil became angry with his limbs, and in 
particular he aroused Augustinum Torueborch, prior of 
the black monastery, which is called Jacobite or 
preacher, who ran from hour to hour to his companion M. 
Johann Snicken, the official of Hamburg Vicarien or 
Commissarien, and held council, what to do, so that their 
kingdom would not fall. Finally they decided that they 
would have to make sure that he did not preach, because 
if he preached so that the common man heard him, their 
mischievousness would come to light and they would not 
be able to do anything about it. For they knew well how 
things had gone in Bremen. On this decision, the Prior of 
the Order of Preachers set out early in the morning, for 
he had not slept much during the night due to great worry, 
and came to the Heath on the Saturday before the other 
Sunday of Advent [Dec. 3]. 


1) In Latin: octobris. 





48 regents of the whole country, and complained highly 
and indicated how the monk of Bremen had come to turn 
the whole country of Diedmar, as he had done to those 
of Bremen; also had to help M. Ginter, the country's 
common chancellor, and Peter Harmen, 2) both great 
enemies of the Word of God. These two helped the prior 
with all diligence, and held up to the other 46 unlearned, 
simple-minded ones, how great praise they would receive 
in the whole of the Low Countries, and how great thanks 
they would earn especially from the Bishop of Bremen, 
where they would put this heretic monk to death. When 
they heard this, the poor unlearned people, they soon 
wrote, 3) and decided to kill him, whom they had not 
seen, much less heard, nor overcome. Finally, the prior 
issued a letter or command to the parish priest of the 48 
regents to expel the monk before he preached, with the 
highest penalty according to the custom of the land. 
Immediately the prior went with haste to Meldorf with the 
commandment, and delivered it to the pious parish priest 
during the night, for he hoped to prevent Henricus from 
preaching, for he knew well what was in it for him. When 
the priest read this letter or commandment, he was very 
surprised by such a commandment, since it was unusual 
that the 48 regents were concerned with the churches, 
when according to the old custom of the country the 
regiment belonged to the whole parish. For it was 
decided by a whole country, in long use, that any parish 
church, according to its good will, had the power to 
appoint and dismiss a parish priest or preacher. The 
parish priest showed this letter to Henrico, and showed 
him what the custom and usage of the country was. 
Henricus answered: after he was called by a whole parish 
to preach the word of God, he wanted to comply with the 
same calling, as long as it pleased the whole community, 
because one had to obey the word of God more.

than man. If God wanted him to die in Diedmar, heaven 
would be as close there as elsewhere; he would have to 
shed his blood once for the sake of God's word. With 
such courage he stood up the following Sunday and 
preached the first sermon from the saying of Paul, Rom. 
1, 9:""God is my witness" 2c. and from the Gospel of the 
same day. As soon as the sermon was over, the entire 
congregation of the parish was called together, and there 
the previous prior delivered a letter from the 48 regents 
of the country, that they should not let the monk preach 
under penalty of a thousand Rhenish florins, and that 
they should also send their legates to the heath with 
authority, because there a whole country would come 
together for a great reason. 

When they heard this letter read, they were almost 
angry that against all national custom such a 
commandment had happened to them, when any parish 
church had power to choose a preacher whom it wished, 
and with one accord they decided to keep and protect the 
pious Henricum as a preacher, for they were completely 
inflamed by the first sermon they had heard. After noon, 
Henricus preached another sermon, on the saying of 
Paul, Rom. 15:1: "But we who are strong" 2c. On Monday 
after that, the people of Meldorf sent their messengers to 
the Heida, and offered themselves justly before everyone 
of the whole country, showing what Christian sermon 
they had heard from Henrico. At the same time the priest 
wrote to the 48 rulers of the country how neither he nor 
Henricus were of the opinion to make rebellion, but to 
teach the pure, clean word of God; he claimed that he 
wanted to stand right with brother Henrich before 
everyone. Therefore, his humble request would be that 
they would not give credence to the monks who, for the 
sake of their hatred and avarice, thought to suppress the 
truth, and [that they] would not condemn the word of God, 
but would investigate the truth completely [for] the first 
time, and would not condemn anyone unheard. If it were 
the case that they were found wrong, they would be 
ready to suffer their punishment. 

This offering, together with the testimony, they 
despised, and gave no answer to it, but everyone talked, 
one this, the other that, in 


Letters from the year 1525. No. 814.

the other that. Lastly, Peter Dethleves, as one of the 
elders, answered: "Although there was almost great 
discord in all the lands because of the faith, and they, as 
the most unlearned and unintelligent, could not judge, it 
was their serious opinion to postpone such a matter until 
a future concilium, which, as reported by their country 
clerk M. Ginter, should be held shortly. What their good 
neighbors would hold and believe, they would also think 
of accepting. But if the word of God (as they say) [so far] 
1) had not been taught clearly enough, and if someone 
could teach it more clearly and more purely, they would 
not think of forbidding it, because they would not think of 
suffering any uproar in the lands. 2) Therefore, everyone 
should be satisfied and let the matter rest until the next 
Easter; in the meantime, it would become clear what was 
right or wrong. Everyone was satisfied with such an 
answer, and the envoys went home from Meldorf and 
showed such an answer to the whole community with 
great joy, hoping that the matter would become good. 

On the day of Nicolai Episcopi [Dec. 6] he preached 
two sermons, the first on the Gospel [Luc. 19:12 ff.]: "A 
nobleman went far away into a country" 2c.; the other on 
the saying [Heb. 7:23]: "There are many who became 
priests" 2c., with such spirit that everyone marveled, and 
asked God with diligence to let them have such a 
preacher for a long time. On the day of the Conception of 
Mary [Dec. 8] he also preached two sermons on the 
Gospel [Matt. 1:1 ff.This is the book of the Nativity", in 
which he showed the promise made by Christ to the 
fathers, and what faith they had, and how we also with 
such faith should be saved, without any merit on our part; 
and all this with such spirit that everyone marveled and 
diligently thanked God that he had sent them such a 
preacher, for they now clearly saw how they could be 
saved by monks and

They were seduced by the priests. They also asked him 
with diligence to stay with them during Christmas and to 
preach every day, because they were afraid that he 
would be called to another place. In the meantime, the 
prior and M. Johann Snicken did not rest. For when the 
prior saw that his wickedness could not go away, he 
went with Doctor Wilhelm of the Order of Preachers to 
Lunden to the gray monks, who are called Barefoot or 
Minores, to seek help and advice on how he might 
accomplish his will, for these same monks are almost 
adept at seducing the poor wretches with their 
legerdemain. 

Immediately the gray monks sent for some of the 
regents, named Peter Rannen, Peter Swyn and Claus 
Rodeun, and showed them with great complaints, as it 
is their custom, how the heretic preaches and seduces 
the people, which is partly dependent on him; if they 
would not see to it and kill the heretic, Mary's praise 
would go down together with the holy two monasteries. 
This was the scripture, 1) when they intended to kill the 
heretic as well; when it happened. When the poor, 
unintelligent people heard this, they became angry, and 
Peter Schwyn answered that they had written to the 
priest and Henrico about what they should do; if it were 
necessary, they would write again. The prior answered: 
No, because you have to deal with the matter differently. 
For if you begin to write to the heretic, he will answer 
you, and you will undoubtedly come into heresy with him 
before you know it; for if he were to speak, nothing would 
be done to him. Then they decided that he should be 
caught secretly in the night and burned immediately, 
before the country would know and he would speak. 
Such advice pleased them all, and especially the gray 
monks. On such advice Peter Rannen, as a special 
friend of the prior, wanted to earn the gratitude, and drew 
to himself several Ammeral 2) from other villages, with 
the help and advice of M. Ginter. One should spare the 
names here; however, after they had sought honor

edition: "groBe Hansen"; Obsopoeus: praefectos. 





have, it is not necessary to deprive them of their honor. 
These are the names of the captains: 

Peter Rannen, Peter Swyn's sons, Hennick zu 
Lunden, Johann Holm, Lorenz Hanneman, Ludwick 
Hanneman, Bastel Johann Bren, Claus’ von 
Weslingburen, Brost Johann von Workenhausen, 
Marquard Kremer zu Henstede, Ludecke Johann zu 
Welsing, Peter GroB, Vogt zu Hemmingstet. These 
captains, together with the others they had with them, 
were summoned to the parish of the New Church, and 
met in M. Ginter's, the scribe's, house, and held council, 
as they sang and did not let him get a word in edgewise, 
for the verdict was that they wanted to burn the good 
Henricum. They decided to go together to Hemmingstet, 
half a mile from Meldorf, the next day after Conceptionis, 
so that no one would warn them. They were also ordered 
to gather in all the villages when the night came and the 
Ave Maria was rung. And they came together by the five 
hundred peasants. When they were gathered together, it 
was publicly shown for what cause they had been 
summoned. For no one, except the captains, knew the 
cause and what they should do. When the commoners 
heard this, they wanted to retreat and not commit such 
an evil deed. But the captains commanded them, body 
and soul, to go away. They had also drunk three tons of 
Hamburger Four there, so that they would be all the more 
courageous. They arrived in Meldorf at midnight at 12 
a.m. with their hands armed. 

The Jacobite or preacher monks gave them light and 
torches, so that they could see and the good Henricus 
could not escape. They also had a traitor with them, 
named Hennig's Hans, who had betrayed all things; they 
forced their way into the parish, smashed everything that 
was there, as is the custom of full, foolish peasants: pots, 
kettles, clothes, cups; but what they found of silver and 
gold, they took with them. They also attacked the priest 
by force, cutting and stabbing him and shouting: "Hit him 
dead, hit him dead! Some of them pushed him naked into 
the dirt on the road and took him prisoner, telling him to 
go with them. The other part shouted that they should let 
him go, because they had no order to let him go with 
them.

to catch him. Afterwards, when they had exercised their 
courage with the priest, they invaded the good brother 
Henrich, and took him naked out of bed, beat, stabbed, 
like the senseless full peasants, and tied his hands 
almost hard on the back, pulled and pushed him so long 
that [it] also moved Peter Rannen with mercy, who was 
otherwise a poisonous enemy of the word of God, and 
said that they let him go, he would probably follow; 
ordered him to lead Balke Johann, who dragged him 
more than he led. When they brought him to 
Hemmingstet, they asked him how he had come into the 
country and what he was looking for. He answered them 
kindly with the truth, so that they were also moved, and 
called out: Only away with him; where we heard him long, 
we would become heretics with him! Then he asked to be 
put on a horse, because he was very tired and weary, and 
his feet were sore to him, for he had walked and led 
barefoot and naked all night in the cold and ice. When 
they heard this, they mocked and laughed at him, saying, 
"Should your heretic be kept on horseback, for he must 
be able to walk? There they brought him to a man's 
house, named Raldenes, 1) and wanted to put a stick with 
iron chains on him. But the father of the house had 
compassion, and would not suffer such things. Since he 
would not permit their courage, they brought good 
Henrich to a priest's Hans, named Mr. Reimer Hozecken, 
a servant of the official of Hamburg, locked him in a cellar, 
and gave him to the full peasants to keep, who mocked 
and jeered at him all night from then on. Among others, 
Mr. Simon, pastor of Altenworden, and Mr. Christian, 
pastor of the New Church, both almost unlearned 
persecutors of the Word of God, came to him and asked 
him for what reason he had taken off the holy garment, to 
which he answered kindly from the Scriptures; but they 
did not understand what he said. 

M. Gunter also came to him, asked him whether he 
preferred to be sent to the Bishop of Bremen or to receive 
his wages in Diedmar? Answered Henricus: | have what 


1) So the German editions; in Latin: Ca/denes. 


If | have taught or acted unchristian, they could well 
punish me for it; God's will be done. M. Ginter answered: 
Listen, dear friends, he wants to die in Diedmar. But the 
people in general waited the whole night of their drinking. 
In the morning, at eight o'clock, they went to the market 
to discuss what they should do. Then the full peasants 
shouted: Always burn! to the fire! so today we will win 
honor from God and from the people; for the longer we 
let him live, the more he consorts with his heresy. What 
is the use of much long misgivings? He must die! So good 
Henry was condemned to the fire without being heard. 
Then it was announced that all those who could have 
helped to catch him should go out to the fire with their 
weapons. There were also the gray monks or barefooted 
men, who strengthened the poor people and said: Now 
go after the matter," and they incited the poor, miserable, 
drunken people. Then they took him and bound him neck, 
feet and hands,”) and led him with a great shout to the 
fire. When this happened, a woman stood in the doorway 
of her house and saw this misery and wretchedness and 
began to weep bitterly; good Henry said to her, "Dear 
woman, do not weep over me. When he came to the 
place where the fire was ready, he sat down in great 
weakness. Then came the bailiff, the bailiff Maes, bought 
by money,” as it is said, condemned the good brother 
Henrich to the fire with this sentence or judgment: "This 
wicked man has preached against the Mother of God and 
against the Christian faith, for which reason | condemn 
him to the fire on account of my gracious lord, the bishops 
of Bremen. Answered the good brother Henry: | have not 
done so; but, Lord, thy will be done! cast upon his eyes 
toward heaven, and said: Lord, forgive them, for they 
know not what they do; thy name alone is holy, heavenly 
Father! There went along a good Christian woman, Claus 
boy's wife, with woman's name 4)

"Jungenfrau, mit Namen Wibe". Also Jken, p. 77, has: "Frau 
Wiebe Jungen".

a sister Peter Nannen, living in Meldorf, before the fire, 
and offered to have her beaten to distemper, so that her 
wrath would be atoned for; for this she wanted to give a 
thousand guilders, 1) only to reinstate the man until the 
next Monday, so that he would be interrogated by the 
whole country, and then burned. When they heard this, 
they became furious and insane, and beat the woman to 
the ground, trampled her underfoot, and violently beat the 
good martyr of Christ. One of them hit him in the skull with 
a rapier, but Johann Holm of the New Churches hit him 
with a hammer; the Audern stabbed him in his sides, in 
his back, in his arms, wherever they could reach him; and 
not once, but as often as he began to speak. 

Then the people admonished and incited M. Guenter, 
and called to them, saying: Free, dear fellows, here dwells 
God! Then the same M. Guenter brought an unlearned 
gray monk to him to confess, but the martyr of Christ said 
to him, "Brother, have | ever harmed or angered you? 
Answered the monk, No. Said the good brother Henry to 
him, What then shall | confess unto thee, that thou 
shouldest forgive me? Then the gray monk was ashamed 
and stepped back. But the fire would not burn, no matter 
how often they lit it. Nothing less did they exercise their 
will of courage on him, and beat him with halberds and 
spears. This went on for about two hours, during which 
time he stood naked in front of the banners in his shirt with 
his eyes raised to the sky. At last they got a big ladder, on 
which they tied him almost hard, so that they threw him 
into the fire. Then the good martyr of Christ began to 
speak his faith, but one of them struck him in the mouth 
with a fist and said to him: "First he should burn, then he 
may pray,?) whatever he wants. Then one of them 
stepped on his chest with a foot, and tied him so hard to 
a sprout on his neck that his mouth and nose bled, so that 
he might "suffocate"; for he saw that he could not die from 
so many wounds. 

After that they raised him up with the ladder. 


1) Probst also reports this in his letter. 
2) Thus the Low German edition; the others: "read". 








Then one of them put the halberd on the ladder to help 
raise it, because the country has no executioner. The 
whisker slipped off the ladder and pierced the holy martyr 
in the middle. So they threw the "good man" with the 
ladder onto the wood, but the ladder jumped off to the 
side. Then Johann Holm ran to him and took the hammer 
and hit him on his chest, so long that he died and did not 
move after that. So we roasted him on the coals, because 
the wood would not burn. 

This is the recent true history of the suffering of St. 
Martin Henrici full of sudphen.

To Hans von Minkwitz, Lord of Sonnenwalde. 


Expert opinion on the church order to be introduced in 
Sonnenwalde and on the use of an endowment from the father of 
Minkwitz. 


From a manuscript in the archive at Weimar in the supplement 
to the Leipzig edition, p. 42; in Walch, vol. XXI, 137; in De Wette, 
vol. Il, p. 619 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 281. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Strict, firm,°) dear Lord! | 
hereby send you both notes, one full of your father's 
foundation, the other of the order, so far kept at 
Sonnewalda, as | have received it. And it is my opinion, 
as best | understand it, that the first three pieces in your 
father's endowment, namely that a chaplain is to be 
appointed to the altar of the Holy Trinity, item the two 
priests with the pupils at Our Lady's Tide, item the 
pageantry with the annual service, 2c., are to be 
completely off, as | have indicated, that they are of no 
use at all. But the persons, who are endowed thereon, | 
wanted to let them use such interest annually throughout 
their lives, and after their death to invest and endow the 
same interest elsewhere to poor people or a pious child 
for marriage. 

The fourth piece with the "gray cloths", to be healed 
under the arms, remains cheap and fine. 


3) "best" at De Wette, which the Erl. Edition reprinted, will 
probably only be read from "Bester".

The fifth piece with the soul bath 1) also pleases me, 
without wanting it to be not a soul bath for the souls, but 
an example of Christ, when he washed the feet of his 
disciples in the Lord's Supper, as also such washing is 
taught by St. Paul, and is an old custom of Christianity; 
so that such a bath of the same example and old 
Christian custom would mean an advertisement and 
likeness, and be held in honor of Christ, your pious bather 
and foot washer. 

The sixth piece, of the four masses, is also to be taken 
off and given to poor housewives and brides, because the 
masses are no good. 

The order, which is set in the other note, does not 
please me badly, and where it would be in the swing, | 
would let it remain so, namely: 

That on Sunday morning a short mass be sung with 
the students and the other priests, because they are 
alive, so that the young boys remain with the psalter and 
chant, and the other priests have something to do. 

However, | did not want to take all Sundays in the 
same way, but always to continue that the whole Psalter 
and Biblia and chant remained in use throughout the 
year, and the students were used to it all. 

Mass to German | let go, | also do not refuse to give 
Latin Mass. 

But | hope to arrange a German one in Wittenberg 
with the time that has the right kind, but that the Canon 
remains outside in all cases, and where there are no 
communicants, that one may not consecrate, but sing the 
chant of the Mass. The sermon has its own order, the 
vespers are also pleasing to me, as they are recorded, 
without always using other and different psalms and 
chants, as is found in books of the time, for the sake of 
the boys' training. 

| do not consider it necessary to have a lesson every 
working day, but it is enough on three days a week, but 
that the boys are nevertheless practiced daily, early in the 
morning and in the evening, with psalms and singing; no 
saint should be sung or celebrated without the feasts that 
concern our Lord Christ. 

1) "Seelbad" is a foundation of baths for the poor, where the 


same were sometimes given food and money, for which it was 
hoped relief in purgatory. 





| consider this to be enough for worship in the place, 
and it is well answerable to God, but how it is to be 
answered for before the world, | do not know; even where 
there is more to be ordered, the preacher can well provide 
for himself, or where he is loved, through our assistance.

No. 816. 
(First months) 1525. 2) 
To Count Albrecht von Mansfeld. 


Luther gives his opinion on two questions posed by Chancellor 
Muller: 1) whether the count should yield in the collegiate church 
and in the whole country to those who want to resist the 
sacrament under both forms and other innovations; 2) whether it 
is permissible to enter into an alliance. 


Wittenberg. 


In the Wittenberg (1569), vol. IX, p. 225; in the Jena (1556), 
vol. Ill, p. 165; in the Altenburg, vol. Ill, p. 99; in the Leipzig, vol. 
XIX, p. 354; in Walch, vol. XXI, 122; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 71 and 
in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 354. 

To the noble and well-born Lord, Lord Albrecht, Count 
of Mansfeld, and Lord of Schruppe! 2c., my 
gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Gracious Lord! Caspar 
Muller, by E. G.'s order, has asked me to answer two 
questions. The first, how far E. G. should go and how far 
he should vacate the monastery church in the castle to 
prevent the sacrament under both forms and other 
innovations, as they call them. It is my humble opinion 
that, because God knows that it is God's word and will, 
and they insist on it, not a hair's breadth nor a moment 
must be yielded, as St. Paul boasts that he would not 
have yielded for an hour in Jerusalem to allow Titum to 
be circumcised [Gal. 2, 3]. For one does not have to suffer 
any opposition to God's word. 


2) On Nov. 24, 1524, Count Albrecht of Mansfeld gave an 
expert opinion to Duke John of Saxony on the question of 
whether, in the event that force should be used to suppress the 
divine word as a result of the Regensburg Convention, the Elector 
Frederick and Duke John, together with other princes adhering to 
the evangelical doctrine, should make an "understanding" as to 
how such action should be resisted. This opinion did not yet fully 
convince the duke, and he asked for a further opinion from the 
count. Inspired by the count, Luther also discussed this question 
at that time. Therefore, this expert opinion probably dates from 
the first months of 1525.

However, because the dispute is over the collegiate 
church, the church may be taken as an external thing, 
which they take by force and outrage, and they may 
stipulate that this is not done with the will or full consent 
of the church's conscience, but that they charge such 
outrage and the theft of other people's rights and property 
to their conscience. The G. must do no more than suffer 
such outrages without consent. 

Apart from that, the Gospels may still keep the Gospel 
in the castle, in the hall or in the parlor in God's name, 
and leave the monastery church to them as an 
outrageous robber with the devil inside; it will probably be 
different in ten years. 

However, it cannot be that in the common dominion, 
the law should also be so soft. For here the matter 
concerns not wood, stone or space, but conscience. 
Because the people recognize themselves as subjects of 
the King, they would refer to the King as a natural ruler, 
and without the King's consent and full word, they would 
not want to create a rivalry among the people. Again, the 
governor cannot allow such common subjects to give 
way to the other lords, for this would make the governor 
herself guilty, as if she had given way herself. However, 
if some of these common subjects want to give way of 
their own conscience, the authorities cannot do so. For 
she can neither drive anyone to faith nor keep him in it, 
as little as she can allow anyone to step away from it. 
Therefore, let him who is weak depart, and let him who is 
standing remain; so the LORD cannot permit them to 
depart, or to say, Behold, our hereditary lord has decreed 
it, and will have it; therefore we do it, and would not do it 
otherwise. 

But that God should hand over the rule is not yet time; 
it is only a temptation and a dispute for a short time, in 
which God wants to prove and strengthen God. G. and 
strengthen him. But E. G. only hold fast to the poor 
common man, do not give in, and command the matter 
to Christ, who will do it well, as the 37th Psalm [v. 5] 
teaches, which | command E. G. to read for comfort and 
strength. 

The devil cannot do all that he would have us do, and 
God boasts that he is pleased to destroy princes and 
rulers, and has pleasure in doing so, Ps. 33:10. 


He has soon strangled a lord at Mansfeld if he wants to 
make it too much for him, or he can well ward him off 
lbefore such a thing is understood. If God wants E. G. out 
lof power, he will probably attack it differently; they will 
lhave to use other force. But there we have one who 
boasts: "The earth is the Lord's, and all that dwell therein," 
Ps. 24:1. item, Ps. 76:13: "He taketh away the courage of 
princes, and dealeth strangely with the kings of the earth." 
Therefore be E. G. only fresh and confident, and learn in 
this also spiritual warfare, as the 31st Ps. [v. 25] says: "Be 
lof good cheer, and hold fast, all ye that wait for the Lord." 

The other is whether one should unite under, behind, 
lor against the authorities, or how to resist such tyrants. In 
tthe first place, E. G. well knows that no union is valid 
lagainst the overlords. For God wants to honor the 
overlords, be they evil or good, Rom. 13,1. and 1 Petr. 2, 
13. 

On the other hand, it is also forbidden that one should 
lavenge or defend oneself, as Paul Rom. 12:19. says: 
"Dear brethren, do not defend yourselves, but give place 
to wrath." 

As for the third, that you otherwise make a union on 
la free, unnamed accident, neither of which is intended, | 
do not consider it unreasonable, although the 
lappearance would remain, since the wicked would have 
to fear as if it should apply to them. For since they hear 
land see that one does not want to grant them, and yet 
they see a connection arising, it is probable that they 
would worry and become suspicious. Otherwise, one 
must give way to violence and sacrilege, and let go of the 
learth for the sake of heaven, of the temporal for the sake 
lof the eternal, just as the princes of Saxony have so far 
lsat completely silent, and would not have had to defend 
themselves over the matter if they had taken it up. 
Nevertheless, the appearance has remained, as if they 
will and want to defend themselves. However, God has 
made the tyrants’ defiance stupid, so that they have 


1) "made" put by us instead of: "would like" in the editions.

must not dare anything. Who knows where we believe 
and ask God that God will also be a shy, be it through the 
appearance of a covenant or otherwise, that they will not 
be so defiant as they threaten. The bow does not hit 
everything it aims at, indeed, it rarely hits it. 

| have indicated this to your humble opinion, at your 
request, and command the same in God's grace, mercy, 
protection and consolation, amen. At Wittenberg, An.

Greetings, | beg you, the Lord [Bishop] of Samland. 
Deuteronomy goes forward (currif). What | answered to 
Carlstadt, you see. That Amandus has gone away, | am 
glad about that. For here, too, Satan is making such 
progress through these prophets that already in 
Nuremberg some citizens deny that Christ is something, 
deny that the word of God is something; they deny 
baptism and the sacrament of the altar, deny civil 
authority, confess only that there is a God, and for this 
reason they are imprisoned in the dungeon. Namely, that 
is where Satan, the spirit of Allstadt and Carlstadt, goes.

deprive yourself of it. By the way, | cannot promise a copy 
to your bookseller, both because | cannot fill my pockets,

who were otherwise already inclined, likewise at 
Strasbourg, the Otto Braunfels and others, so that they

Carlstadt to Luther. 
(Regest.) 

Carlstadt responds to a letter from Luther dated Dec. 23, 1524 
(which does not exist), which he received only on Feb. 18. ') He 
urgently asks for a safe conduct letter promised to him by Luther 
and assures in the most effusive terms his willingness to be 
guided by the truth. He says: "I will be softer with the bright 
speech of Christ and the clear judgments of the Lord than the 
snow with the hottest fire, and run faster than the lightest particle 
to the amber warmed by rubbing." 2)

A joint marriage memorial issued with the other Wittenberg 
theologians and the jurist Benedict Pauli.

in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 129. 


To the venerable father, Mr. Paul Lemberg, abbot in 
Sagan. 

Hail! Venerable Father! We, Martin Luther, Jodocus 
Jonas, Johann Bugenhagen Pommer, Benedict Pauli, 
Philipp Melanchthon, 3) declare to you and your church 
that we have heard the case of the woman Hedwig and 
Erasmus Hertzog and have read the public acts. 
Accordingly we judge thus 


1) See St. Louis Edition, Vol. XX, Introduction, p. 22 d f. - 
Carlstadt received this letter at Rothenburg a. d. T., where, 
however, by a town council edict of Jan. 27, it had been forbidden 
to "house, harbor, drag under, etch, water or fart" him, but 
protected by the old mayor Ehrenfried Kumpf, he remained there 
until his public appearance, without ever leaving the city in the 
meantime, as Kumpf confessed in the council on March 27. 

2) Thus, also according to Spalatin's translation: "und will ehr 
zulaufen, denn ein tayle zu einem erwermten ecsteyn, Wenn er 
geriben wird", these words are to be understood. By "a tayle" he 
seems to have rendered particula for us (for so it will be read 
instead of stipula, which the Erl. Briefw. has placed in the text, 
but doubts by a question mark; or instead of stigula at Kolde; the 
Conjectur of the Erl. Briefw.: tegula [brick] may have come from 
misunderstanding of the word "ecsteyn" for cornerstone); 
"ecsteyn", however, is to be resolved by "Agtstein", which is 
amber. See St. Louis edition, vol. VIII, 1788 ; ibid. vol. XXII, 1333. 

3) Melanchthon was the writer of the letter. He also signed it 
with Luther, but did not co-sign it.

about the case of conscience: If the woman confirms with 
a good conscience that the husband was not wealthy or 
could not have performed the marital duty, then he was 
not her husband, and she is free. However, it shall not 
hinder the weakness and conscience of the wife that 
Erasmus Hertzog denies that he is not wealthy, if he does 
not prove or has not proven the opposite. And because 
the woman Hedwig has been living with the magister 
Balthasar Jugel for a long time, and he assures that he 
had her as his wife, it is reasonable that he keeps her. 
For since he has taken the one who has fled from the 
impecunious man, he has clearly bound his conscience. 
You will do right if you confirm the marriage with the lawful 
customs. We also bear witness to this judgment of ours 
with our seals. Farewell. Given at Wittenberg, February 
20, 1525 by Martin Luther.

worse. Is not 1) God Himself a bear and a lion for the 
wicked [Hos. 13:8], but salvation and life for the godly? 
Since the sacrament is instituted by the power of the word 
and is also imparted by the power of the word, no 
consideration is given to the minister who performs it 
when the sacrament is_ considered, although 
consideration is to be given to it when its own 
blessedness is considered. For Christ also instituted and 
blessed it, not by the power of His holiness, but by the 
power of the Word. Therefore, just as the Word of God, 
wherever it may be, is a mighty power of God, 2) even 
though the ungodly do not enjoy this power: so the 
Sacrament, where it is blessed, is a perfect Sacrament, 
even though the ungodly do not enjoy this blessing. For 
we are the ones who plant and water, administering the 
Word of Life and the Sacrament of Blessedness, but we 
are not the ones who give the flourishing. But we 
administer the same Word and Sacrament that Christ 
administered, who also, as he did nothing to the Jews by 
the Word, so to Judas Iscarioth he gave the Sacrament in 
vain. Nevertheless, he taught them the true Word and 
gave him the true Sacrament. Otherwise, if one had to 
look at the faith of those who administer and those who 
receive, everything would be uncertain whether the Word 
and the Sacrament were anywhere, since the faith of all 
is uncertain. Now the whole essence and power 
(integritas) of the Sacrament is not based on your laws 
or our merits, but on the promise, so that the knowledge 
of the sacred office is firm and certain among the people 
of God. This is what | would like to say. You take it for the 
best, and pray Christ for me, whose grace be with you, 
Amen. Wittenberg, on Sunday Invocavit [March 5] 1525.

Doctor! My most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony 2c..,

humble and diligent request for the escort of Doctor 
Karlstat to his electoral counsellors, who are now at 
Torgau in daytime performance, together with my humble} 
request and notification. 


ordered me to inform you that His C. F. G. has some 
reservations about this. G. has ordered me to inform you 
that his C. F. G. is a little concerned about this, because 
his C. F. G. has many doubts as to whether it would be 
good that the Karlstat should come to Wittenberg at this 
time. Moreover, that his C. F. G. had always let 
themselves be heard against papal and imperial 
embassies, also in other ways, that they never got 
involved in a matter, as they also did not let themselves 
be involved again in representing the same. Should S. C. 
G. now enter into this with the representation of Karlstat, 
then this would have to be done by public letter and seal 
of his C. G., which would particularly indicate and present 
Karlstat at many ends and to many people, which would 
then be known to the one who has his C. F. G. 
beforehand. F. G. had previously said about himself, 
might also perhaps be considered by some, who do not 
know the cause of the misdirection, as if his C. F. G. had 
also been in his opinion at the time of the misdirection. F. 
G.'s opinion is also pending. Thus, S. C. F. G. does not 
note from your letter that you yourselves can particularly 
comfort the matter. Therefore, it is highly esteemed of my 
lord and master that you should request that he be 
granted a hearing. | request that you spare his C. F. G. 
and S. C. F. G. brothers, my gracious Lord Duke 
Johansen of Saxony, in this matter, and do not doubt that 
you will know how to report and refuse this to the Karlstat, 
which I, in the best interest of you, have no longer known 
how to do. | would have liked to report this to you much 
sooner, but the councilors' concerns have only just 
arisen, from which this answer has so far been withheld, 
and | hereby entrust you to God's grace and protection.

Grace and peace! | send you back the suns, the 
miraculous signs of God, my dear Spalatin, but it is not my 
business to understand such things, because | am not such 
a prophet. Indeed, the bloody sun in the west seems to 
signify the king of France, and the other quite bright one in

Luther. 


To the honorable and artistic master goldsmiths of 
Nuremberg, my special favorable gentlemen and 
friends. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear 

ords and friends! | ask you very kindly. Let your wisdom 
ear with me my foolish letter, for those who know without 
joubt Christian teaching that, just as Christ became a fool 
nd a mockery to the world for our sake, so also we 
mong ourselves owe service to one another, acting 

oolishly and foolishly; for Christian love does not respect 
orldly shame and disgrace. 

Here is this pious, well-skilled journeyman, Andreas 
Heydenreich, who, after noting how priesthood and 
monasticism, to which he adheres, is a dangerously un- 
Christian being, as it is now, intends to turn away from it 
and make an honest living with his own hands. But since 
he is inclined to your craft and especially to your art, which 
is famous far above other cities, eager, in good hope, to 
grasp it well with God's help, he has asked me through 
several high personalities for an intercession to your 
wisdom, hoping to enjoy my intercession with your 
wisdom. Now | have not been able to deny my service to 
such people, nor to his need, although I, an unknown 
person, almost unwillingly approach E. W. with it. But 
because they praise and extol the journeyman to me as 
being pious and skillful, | kindly ask E. W. to be helpful to 
him in his desire for your craft, if the same could be done 
without your complaint, for | also do not intend to burden 
1) On March 20, a meeting of Philip of Hesse with the dukes of E. W. with anything unreasonable. 
Saxony, John and John Frederick, took place in Kreuzburg on the 
Werra. They agreed on the measures to be taken against the 
alliance of the Catholic princes at Dessau. Philip said there that he 
would rather give up life and limb, land and people, than depart 
from God's word. 

2) After the preachers of the gospel were expelled in Antwerp, 

a slater, Eloy Pruystinck, appeared as a prophet and founded a 


sect, the Loy isten. Luther rejected him with his ravings and warned 
the Antwerp people in a public letter.

Drechsler, Drechsel, Teutsches and Johann Preding (the 
preacher)” was beheaded at Nothenburg on June 1, 1525, while 
Carlstadt escaped on June 23." |). Johann Preding was captured 
on June 23 and beheaded on July 1 (see St. Louis edition, vol. 
XVI, 152 f.). Carlstadt, on the other hand, must have made his 
escape earlier, for he wrote to Luther from Frankfurt am Main as 
early as June 12. The letter is found in Burkhardt, p. 85 and is 
also in Erl. Briefw., Vol. V, p. 193, where p. 194, note 3, it is 
reported that Carlstadt had left Nothenburg at the end of May. On 
June 6, he was at the farmers’ convention in Schweinfurt (Késtlin, 
Vol. I, p. 753).

lam sending you, dear Luther, what Zwingli has 
written in the past few days about the Lord's Supper; 
although it has been written somewhat badly (radius) 
by my scribe, you will nevertheless recognize it to 
some extent, 


1) Jonas says in a writing against Wicel that StrauB ruled not 
only in the church, but also as Amtmann, Rath 2c. 

2) The so-called Wéhrder Bauer. He called himself in the 
preface to his Sermon von der Abg6tterei, 1524, Diepold 
Peringer, a peasant, born of Ulm, who can neither write nor read; 
Spalatin, ap. Mencken, ||, 632, calls him Dieboldum Schusterr ex 
Aichenbrunnen, rusticum Augustin. dioc..; but this was an 
assumed name, he was rather an expelled Swabian clergyman. 
In 1524 he appeared in the area around Nuremberg, especially 
in W6hrd and Thon, but also in the city itself as a powerful 
preacher, who aroused even Spalatin's amazement. But when 
the Archduke Ferdinand complained to the city council on March 
4, 1524 (Férstemann, Neues Urkundenbuch, p. 155a) that a 
peasant was being allowed to preach, the council expelled him 
from the city. He went first to Kitzingen and then to Rothenburg. 
Involved in the peasants’ revolt, he is said to have been drowned. 

3) Baum has placed this date in the margin without giving 
reasons for it (Erl. Briefw.). - It seems to us that this letter must 
be dated further back, because Zwingli's letter had already 
appeared in print in March with Christoph Froschauer in Zurich 
(see St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 1529, note 3), and Zwingli 
already sent his copy to the Strasbourgers on Dec. 12, 1524.

Luther writes that he is about to go to Eisleben with Philip and

of the other schools in 1524, in May 1525, remained there until 
April 13, 1528, when he returned to Wittenberg as a preacher at

Myconius. He was born on Dec. 26, 1491, at Lichtenfels in Upper 
Franconia, came to Annaberg in 1504 to the Rector Andreas 
Weidner, called Staffelstein. Here he heard Tetzel preach in 1508, 
and as a poor man wanted to have the indulgence for free, for 
God's sake, which he denied him (see Myconius' Narrative, St. 
Louis Edition, vol. XV, 364, no. 98). On July 14, 1510, he entered 
the Franciscan monastery at Annaberg, was transferred from 
there to Leipzig and Weimar, and was ordained a priest in Weimar| 
in 1516. In the same year he became a priest in Weimar, and 
joined the Lutheran movement from the beginning, for which he 
suffered much from his fellow monks, who finally brought him to 
Leipzig and Annaberg, so that he would be under the control of 
Duke George. From here he fled to Zwickau in 1524, and Duke 
Johann assigned him as a preacher to Gotha in the same year, 
where he remained until his death on April 7, 1546.

Grace and peace through Christ our Savior. 
Honorable and wise, dear lords and friends! At your 
written request, | have done my best to appoint a skilled 
preacher for you. Now it did not happen that Mr. Johann 
Pommer, whom you yourselves named and desired, 
could have been given to you, as | would have liked to 
have seen; for our congregation did not want him, so that 
we also kept people here, through whom we could 
educate others and serve other cities. Michaelem 
Hanlein, 1) an almost pious, sedentary and learned man 
in all things, whose like | know of no other here; so that | 
hope you will be provided for and cared for, and that he 
will please you greatly every day. To the same | 
command your wisdom and love, let him be commanded 
to you, if rather he goes from us to you in foreign lands, 
and see that he is Christian and well provided for 
according to your promise; as Christ and Paul teach 
many times that those who teach us the word are worthy 
to be held in twofold honor. | also ask you, my dear lords 
and friends, to do and suffer whatever you want to do 
and suffer, so that you may have peace among 
yourselves, and see to it that no swarming spirits come 
among you, as unfortunately such people cause much 
misery here in Upper Germany, as E. W. may well have 
heard. If something is to be changed or broken, be it 
pictures or whatever it may be, that such should not be 
done by the common man, but by proper authority of the 
council, lest, as elsewhere, there should be a tendency 
to despise the authorities, wnom God wants to be feared 
and honored. In particular, however, that E. W. see to it 
that you are not taught to govern according to the law of 
Moses, much less according to the Gospel, as | have 
said in the following. 


1) He is identical with Michael Maurer, who was called 
Hanichen (Galliucus, Hahnlein) after his birthplace. He arrived in 
Gdansk on June 1 and preached at St. Mary's Church until the 
Reformation was violently suppressed after the entry of King 
Sigismund of Poland on April 17, 1526. On May 3, 1526, he was 
imprisoned along with the other preachers, but was released by 
Duke Albrecht of Prussia, who took him to Prussia on May 26, 
where he became pastor first in Rastenburg, then in 1531 in 
Lébenicht-Kénigsberg, where he died in 1537. 





| have written it down on a piece of paper, and | have 
ordered it to your preacher, Mr. Michael, who will teach 
you well; obey him. Hereby commanded to God, who 
strengthens and multiplies you to His praise and honor, 
Amen. Date Wittenberg, on the Friday before Jubilate 
[May 5] 1525. 


Copia note enclosed. 


The law of Moses is dead and entirely abe, even 
given to the Jews alone; we Gentiles are to obey the laws 
of the land where we live, as St. Peter says in the first 
epistle on the 5th: "of all human order". But the gospel is 
a spiritual law, according to which one cannot rule, but 
must make it for himself, whether he will do it or not. And 
one cannot and should not force anyone to do it, just as 
one would force one to believe; for here it is not the 
sword, but the Spirit of God that must teach and rule. 
Therefore, the spiritual rule of the Gospel should be 
separated from the outward worldly rule, and should not 
be mixed with each other. The preacher is to conduct the 
evangelical rule with his mouth alone, and let each one 
have his own will here; whoever accepts it, let him take 
it all, whoever does not want it, let him leave it. As if to 
give an example, the purchase of interest or the interest 
penny is quite unevangelical, since Christ teaches, 
"Lend without taking again!" Here one should not go to 
it, and all division should be strictly abolished according 
to the gospel, nor does anyone have the right or power 
to do so, for it came from human order, which St. Peter 
does not want torn apart, but one should preach it, and 
give it home to those to whom the interest is due, 
whether they want to accept such a gospel from 
themselves, and let the interest go, or not. No further can 
they be urged. For the gospel requires willing hearts, 
driven by the Spirit of God. But this is what is to be done 
with the interest, that human order, laws and customs 
are brought to justice in such interest, if they go too far, 
and according to equity, which is called xxxxxxxxx or 
aequitas, 
judges. For all laws and customs should be subject to 
natural equity as their rule and master. If one now wants 
to abolish the interest, one must not go to it and abolish 
it all at once. For it 


742 


It could be that one had spent a thousand guilders three 
years ago, and had hardly accumulated two hundred 
guilders of interest; this would be too short, and would be 
an unreasonable robbery, and the interest man would be 
entitled to too much, without all justice. Item, one should 
also not break off interest on the principal sum. For why 
should | give a thousand guilders of my own and have 50 
of them given to me every year, if | were a child, | would 
keep them just as much and take 50 guilders of them 
myself every year. These are all unreasonable things, 
and are an imposed gospel. For the gospel teaches to 
freely let go of all goods, but whoever forces or compels 
me to do so takes away what is mine. Now if one wants 
to justify interest, there are two ways. The first is to justify 
them according to human laws, namely to give 5 guilders 
per hundred to be used for a year, and to put the same 5 
guilders into the estate, that is, onto a certain pledge 
standing in the estate, such as fields, meadows, ponds, 
houses, so that if it does not bear for a year, or bears little, 
the interest is also reduced according to it, as the natural 
laws teach, and this would have to be recognized by the 
Honorable Council or reasonable people. The other is to 
consider the difference of persons and time, and to act 
according to their will: if the person is of good fortune, and 
has occupied it for a long time, that one should theid with 
them, that they should nevertheless let part of the interest 
received go to the main property; but if the person is old 
and unable, that one should not thus push his mouth off 
the manger and make him a beggar, but let them keep

Wittenberg were also there, and now even that: It would 
be a pity that such a school, since the Gospel is spread 
all over the world, should disappear like this, and yet 
people are needed everywhere, and no one helps to 
create them. Wherever E. F. G. wants to help, | humbly 
ask that E. F. G. help diligently, and not obey whether 
some great courtiers would speak contemptuously of 
scribes, because E. F. G. sees how the world cannot be 
ruled by force alone, but must have learned people who 
help the people with God's word by teaching and 
preaching; and of course, if there were no teachers and 
preachers, worldly power would not stand for long, let it 
be said that God's kingdom would have to come from us.

| hope that you will come to the aid of my weakness, 
even though it is the most important and desirable 
thing. 

On 19. May the exceedingly joyful news came 
here about my subjects, my brothers, that they expect 
above all things nothing so much and implore with 
anxious sighing from God than that they may be freed 
from such tyrannical captivity, in which they are 
oppressed in a miserable way according to the 
ungodly desires of the clergy, for whom it is not 
enough to rage against the body and against temporal 
goods, if they do not also strive to destroy the 
exceedingly wholesome word of God at the same time 
as all the heavenly gifts that have been acquired for 
us by Christ. But listen, | beg you, to the glorious 
miracles of the exceedingly gracious GOD! He has so 
enkindled almost the entire peasantry and the 
bourgeoisie of the entire empire for my return that 
they now, with the utmost desire, would like to see, 
desire and ‘wish for' him whom they had previously 
despised as king, persecuted and rejected. So even 
with God is all comfort and victory, however much the 
others, the more powerful, 1) oppose. 2) Trusting in 
this mercy, | have no doubt that by God's grace | will 
be able to tell you more certain things before all. In 
the meantime, dearest brother, by your fervent 
prayer, which is definitely more useful than all help 
from men, you will entrust my cause to the 
exceedingly good will of God, according to which 
everything may be done; we may die or we may live, 
we may rule or we may serve, so it will be pleasing by 
His grace. Farewell. At Lier,®) on the 20th day of May,

D. Joh. Riihel, Mansseldischer und 


Magdeburgischer Rath, to Luther. 
(Two fragments.) 


In the first fragment, Ruhel reports that Muenzer has not only 
revoked his previous teachings, but has become a Papist 
altogether; in the second, he asks Luther to write to the Elector of 
Mainz about his marriage. 


1) Here Seckendorf adds in brackets: "namely the bishops and 
the noblemen, as is known elsewhere". 

2) The rebellion that broke out in Christian's favor was 
suppressed after two heavy defeats. 

3) Lier is a town in the Belgian province of Antwerp. where the 
governor! Margaretha had ordered the king and his wife to live 
there. 





From the original, which was then in the possession of D. 
Caspar Sagittarius in Jena, Seckendorf, Hist. Luth. Il, p. 13a and 
p. 20a, has provided these two fragments, the former in Latin 
translation. After that in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 176. Seckendorf 
added the date in both places. 


I. 

Muenzer, in his prison, and in him Satan, in order 
to flatter the godless tyrants, not only recanted his 
errors, 4) and used the Sacrament under one form, 
but also confessed the Roman faith, and became 
entirely a Papist. Although this has a good 
appearance, it is not without poison, as you can see 
from the fact that he admitted that he had erred in all 
things, thatis, that he also recanted the true teachings 
of the Gospel. 

Il. 

| would like you to write a letter of comfort to my 
most gracious lord of Magdeburg in these perilous 
times and an exhortation to change his status (you 
understand me well), 5) but that | would like to have a 
copy of it; | want to go to Magdeburg today to act in 
the matter. God Almighty grant me mercy! Ask God 
from Heaven to grant grace to such serious work and 
undertakings. | hope you understand me well, | do not 
want to be written. Please, please, please for God's 
sake, grant me grace and strength as a worker.

To Duke Albrecht of Prussia. 
Luther wishes him luck in resigning his office as Grand Master; 
he promises to send a preacher to Prussia and asks him to help 
two virgins to obtain their inheritance. 


4) See the confession of Thomas Muenzer, St. Louis edition, 
vol. XVI, 122, no. 781. There is nothing to be seen of a revocation 
of the true teachings of the Gospel. The questioning took place 
in two ways, first "in kindness," then "embarrassingly"; the latter 
concerns only personal matters. The remark of the Erl. 
Briefwechsel to the words: "in kindness", namely: "in reality: 
under torture", is therefore not quite correct. 

5) Luther did this on June 2, as Seckendorf thinks, with the 
knowledge and will of Elector Albrecht.

From Seckendorf's Hist. Luth. lib. ll, p. 13 printed in Erl.

Although the opponents claim that Munzer's letter to 
the people of Mihlhausen is a retraction, it seems to me 
to be more of an insistence, for he alone accuses the 
peasants of having caused their own ruin by following 
their benefit too closely. Whatever they may say, |

Our greeting before. Worthy and esteemed, dear 
devotee! We have heard the length of your letter, and 
since it concerns the entertainment of the most 
necessary persons in Wittenberg and the university 
there, we do not want to reassure you that our mind 
and opinion is not to let the laudable work perish, but 
are rather inclined to help it, so that it may increase 
and be comforting to all of Christendom and the 
German nation. As it has been the will of the Highborn 
Prince Friderich, Duke of Saxony, Elector, of laudable 
memory, of our dear brother. But now that we are not 
able to order things constantly according to your 
reports, due to the burdensome trades and runs, we 
graciously request that you enable the persons 
everywhere whom you report to us and are to read, so 
that they will do diligently and not celebrate in that 
which is due to each until our arrival. For if God 
Almighty helps us, of which we have no doubt that he 
will do it, that we will stop the senseless uprisings here 
outside in these lands, and submit ourselves to the 
electoral office in Saxony, we want to make the 
arrangements with your and other scholars’ advice 
and concern, so that we will not be found wanting for 
the preservation of the University of God to the praise 
and benefit of common Christianity, that you may well 
put them off on our account. All this

Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have 
read all the contents of your letter with a humble 
request that we would like to support and help our lord 
and father, so that the high school and university in 
Wittenberg, after it was not provided with a man who 
would be in service to it, might again be appointed, 
and the persons who move away daily be preserved, 
and have noted such notification from you to your 
grace; We have also talked with our Lord Father about 
it, and have noted so much of his love that his loved 
ones are inclined to support you on the same 
occasion, and if his loved ones were to go down to the 
church, to inform their minds, and to help promote, so 
that the university may once again, as much as 
possible, be preserved. Therefore, it is our most 
gracious request that you use all possible diligence to 
preserve the university, for whatever our Lord and 
Father may know how to do to accommodate it, his 
love will undoubtedly not be lacking. That we do not 
want to save you in our gracious opinion, so that we 
are inclined to you. Date Eisenach, Thursday after

To Spalatin. 
Luther sends a letter (which no longer exists) to the Elector, 
exhorting him not to postpone the marriage of the Elector-Prince.

Il, p. 293d; in De Wette, vol. Il, p. 679 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, 
p. 189. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 978. 

To his brother, M. Georg Spalatin, the servant of 
Christ at the court of Saxony, who is extremely 
dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | am sending a letter to the Elector, 
my dear Spalatin, because | thought that was enough, 
since the younger prince surrenders completely to the will 
of the older one. 2) The clergyman for Prussia has not yet 
appeared; today you are looking for him, and when you 
find him, he will be asked, and it will be written to you. 
The dangers of a thing that is drawn out, | think, can be 
gathered sufficiently from proverbs, from experience and 
from examples. The sayings are: Procrastination has 
harmed those who were ready, and: There is danger 
ahead. "Night deadline, year deadline." He who is not 
skilful today will be even less so tomorrow. If one has 
guessed, it is necessary to put it into practice soon. 
Certainly such sayings are gleaned from experience, and 
scriptural passages dealing with sacred things agree with 
them, as Paul exhorts "that we should not receive the 
grace of God in vain," and the bride in the Song of Songs 
laments that the bridegroom had departed when she 
hesitated to open. And in German one says: "Wenn GOtt 
griBet, soll man danken, item: Wenn man das Ferkel 
beut, soll mau den Sack herhalten." A pagan example: 
since Hannibal could, he did not want to bring Rome to 
ruin; afterwards he could not, since he wanted to. In the 
Holy Scriptures: Since Esau could have the birthright, he 
despised it; afterwards he wept 


2) On August 6, Spalatin was in Wittenberg, as he writes to 
Warbeck, to negotiate with Luther by order of the Elector 
(probably because of the marriage of the Elector Prince to Sibylla 
of Julich). - "The clergyman for Prussia" is Poliander.

in vain. And Christ says Joh. 7, 34: "You will search for 
me and will not find me"; [Joh. 12, 36. 35.:] "Believe in 
the light, because you have it, so that the darkness will 
not overtake you." Summa: All Scripture, all creation, all 
experience testifies that the temporal benefits of God are 
indeed temporal, therefore they do not last, but are ina 
constant course and violent movement,” therefore one 
must seize each one,”) whatever it may be, when and 
where one can, so that it does not escape. But what they 
pretend, that they will be safe of their minds, is foolish. 
For no man's heart is in his power; the devil is 
exceedingly powerful, who more frequently separates 
even those who are already united, and how many 
examples of broken marriages there are for this cause 
alone, that they have been postponed! How much more 
danger is to be feared here, since the marriage has not 
yet been publicly consummated. They must be 
admonished that they should not fight against all this 
alone. They will not bring it to pass that this is void and 
false, by their one and new example; therefore may they 
stand in fear, if they heartily desire that the thing be done.

Carlstadt to Lnther. 


He asks Luther to forgive him for everything he sinned against 
him out of the old Adam and to intercede for him with the Elector. 
He apologizes for not having participated in the riot. If he had not 
already responded to Luther's writing (against the heavenly 
prophets), he would no longer do so. He piteously pleads that 
Luther take care of him, his wife and his child; he has nowhere to 
take refuge. 


A copy of the letter, probably originally in Latin, is in the 
Weimar Archives, N, p. 367, No. 183. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 85 
and in Erl. Briefw., Vol. V, p. 193. 


God's Grace and Peace. Venerable Doctor and 
dear Godfather! This is my request that you forgive 
me for all that |, moved by the old Adam, have sinned 
against you. Then look at my poor and miserable wife 
and child, have mercy on them and forgive us. 


The authorities have shown that the homo miser, whom Luther 
kept hidden, was not Cellarius, but Carlstadt. The most 
dangerous time for the real or supposed participants in the 
peasants’ revolt was around June; on May 30, Muenzer was 
beheaded, on July 1, 34 rebels in Rothenburg. Cellarius, as we 
can see from this document, was already in Kénigsberg at this 
time, away from danger. There he was kept "in Christian honest 
custody," that is, closed off from contact with the outside world, 
and only regained his freedom on February 9, 1526. Therefore, 
Melanchthon's letter to Brismann (Corp. Ref., Vol. |, 756) cannot 
be dated to August 1525, but, because it reports Cellarius' arrival 
in Wittenberg, to March 1526 at the earliest. Thus, an alibi for 
Cellarius seems to be completely proven.

concieo) will be read.

Johann Brismann to Luther. 
(Fragment.) 


Brismann reports his marriage, as well as that of the bishop 
of Samland. Duke Albrecht of Prussia had written to Luther about 
Martin Cellarius, who had come there, and was awaiting his 
judgment about him.

has called and led me to Prussia, has given me,

before our wedding. You pray that God will shortly

1) gentilis cum gentibus is a joking expression chosen by 
Luther, which could also be translated: to the Gentiles with the 
Gentiles. 

2) The answer to the question: What entitles Luther to any 
good hopes for Carlstadt? will be impossible for those who deny 
that Luther just at this time kept Carlstadt hidden in his house. 
(See St. Louis Edition, Vol. XX, Introduction, p. 24, Note 4.) On 
June 12, Carlstadt would have written to Luther from Frankfurt a. 
M. (No. 877). His wife delivered the letter, and had to return from 
Wittenberg to Frankfurt before Carlstadt could find out about the 
asylum Luther offered him there. Given the long distance 
between the two places, it cannot be assumed that Carlstadt 
could have arrived in Wittenberg earlier than the beginning of 
July. Since Luther himself says (St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXII, 1824, 
No. 129) that Carlstadt stayed longer than eight weeks in his 
house, Carlstadt's stay there must have lasted until the beginning 
of September.

To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, 
John, Duke of Saxony, Elector, Landgrave in 
Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most 
gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! M. Georgius Spalatinus has 
reported to me that 3) in his recent farewell to E. C. F. 
G., he has obtained the right to continue to concern 
himself with the profession and burden of the parish 
office in Altenburg, and has asked me to write to E. C. F. 
G. for this purpose. Thus | humbly inform E. C. F. G. that 
| still hold to my previous opinion; for the person is well 
learned, well eloquent, in addition sedate and chaste, 
and, what moves me most of all, has a good, righteous 
heart, who means the word of God and the souls with 
faithfulness. And whether he will be weak in body, 
experience shall teach us; otherwise there is no faith 
here. Moreover, the council of Altenburg wrote to me to 
have our prior, as indicated by Doctor Wenceslaus, next 
to Magister Spalatin: | did not spare my diligence. But 
because the above-mentioned council is seeking this 
from E. C. F. G., it will be necessary that E. C. F. G. 
request the same prior, Magister Eberharden, in writing 
for the parish office, if he pleases E. C. F. G.. For the 
person is skilful and capable enough; but because he 
makes himself difficult for it, and has undertaken 
otherwise, a stronger profession is needed here than is 
the council's and mine. Put all this in E. C. F. G.'s concern 
and pleasure. But there is one thing | must humbly 
request of E. C. F. G., that E. C. F. G. would have a 
gracious understanding that the parish goods or interest 
of those who have used them up to now, would be

to the present and new pastors. For it is unpleasant that 
they should work, and others should take the wages, as 
they have done until now, and would probably do forever, 
if they were allowed to. So it is also to be considered that 
[it] might henceforth become too difficult for the council 
and the city with a new provision. He who does not want 
to preach the gospel should not feed on the preaching of 
the gospel; it is permitted him lukewarmly enough. 

And for myself, as a caretaker for the Gospel, | ask 
that the monks of Altenburg seek to confirm their previous 
unchristian nature, in God's disservice and vexatious 
abuse, with E. C. F. G., so that E. C. F. G. will graciously 
turn it away from them, and turn them away to the Word 
of God and to the image of other Christian communities. 
For it would be blasphemous, where the fallen idolatry 
should be set up again, as there is no doubt in my mind, 
that they will almost make an effort with ECFG. And- 
although | knew that E. C. F. G., by the grace of God, 
knows all this well himself and is inclined to do it, | did not

To Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz. 


Luther intercedes for Asmus Ginthel of Eisleben, who was 
allegedly involved in the peasant uprising.

Jena edition (1556), vol. Ill, p. 166; in the Altenburg edition, vol. 
Ill, p. 155; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, p. 549; in Walch, vol.

Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg 2c, 
Elector, Margrave of Brandenburg 2c, my most 
gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ JEsu. Most reverend in 

GOD Father, most noble, most highborn Prince, most 
gracious Lord! | am 








report how a citizen's son from Eisleben, named Asmus 
Ginthel, was caught by E. C. F. G., as if he should have 
helped storming the outworks 1) 2c. Now, however, his 
father is doing so miserably, and indicates how his son 
did not storm, but only ate and drank inside at that time, 
with a piteous request that | would make an intercession 
to E. C. F. G. to save his life, which | then could not refuse: 
is therefore my humble request that E. C. F. G. would 
consider that this riot is not a crime. would see that this 
rebellion is not quelled by human hand or counsel, but by 
God's grace, who has had mercy on all of us, and first on 
the authorities, and in turn also act graciously and 
mercifully with the poor people, as is well befitting spiritual 
authorities, and more due than secular ones, so that 
God's grace may be recognized and thanked, and it may 
be proven before the world that one has not sought and 
desired lust. 

For otherwise, unfortunately, there are all too many 
who treat people so cruelly and act so ungratefully toward 
God, as if they want to wantonly arouse the anger and 
displeasure of God and the people in turn, and invite upon 
themselves a new and worse turmoil. For God soon 
decreed otherwise, that those who do not show mercy 
perish without mercy. 

So it is not good to be master with unwillingness, 
reluctance and enmity of the subjects; it also has no 
permanence. It is good that earnestness and wrath are 
proven, since the people were found rebellious and 
stubborn and obdurate in their work. But now that they 
have been pushed, they are different people, and worthy 
of mercy in addition to punishment. Too much tears the 
sack on both sides; but measure is good for all things, 
and mercy prevails against judgment, says St. James 
[Jac. 2, 13]. 

| hope that E. C. F. G. will know how to keep to this in 
a Christian way. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. At 
Wittenberg, on Friday Praxedis [July 21] Anno 1525.

wedding, 1) but the messenger had left. He certainly 
proves to be difficult against this profession, although he 
is skilful and useful, because he intended to become a 
layman. But | have written to the prince that he appoint 
him and see to it that the income of the parish is restored 
to the ministers of the Word, and also that a measure is 
set for the godless canons and that they are not 
strengthened in their opinions and customs. | have good 
hope in everything concerning this matter. The prince 
has complained against me that you are leaving his 
country, and it would not please me either if | did not hope 
that you will produce fruit there, and if | thought that your 
Altenburgs are farmers. For | am not moved by your

Grace and peace in the Lord! | recommend this John 
Queytzen, a troubled and poor man, to you, my dear 
Wenceslaus, because you could provide him with a small 
service, although | send him to you with little hope, since 
you are more used to sending such people to me, and 
we also have many other poor brothers; but [I do it] 
because he asked me in such a way, trusting in you, that 
the Lord might provide something for him there. If this is 
nothing, then the way and the same journey is free for 
him if he wants to return. The prior sends his regards to 
you, who is now no longer prior, but Magister Eberhard. 
We have given up the income of the monastery and 
placed it in the hands of the prince. Be well and pray for 
me. On Monday after Jacobi [July 31] 1525.

Schwabische Rotte", but there can hardly be any doubt that it 
must be given by "der schwabische Bund". - All editions, except 
the Erl. Briefw., misread: Meiningen instead of: Memmingen. The 
Allgaeu peasants had encamped in front of Memmingen, into 
which the Swabian Union captain Diepold von Stein had thrown 
2000 men on foot and 200 horsemen, who made a lucky sortie, 
but without being able to drive off the peasants. These only 
withdrew voluntarily on the approach of the federal army under 
Truchsess on June 27, heading for Babenhausen and 
Oberginzburg, not in flight, however, but in an orderly fashion, 
and were only dispersed by treachery near Kempten toward the

100 castles have been taken in Ferdinand's duchy, but in

courtiers against the Gospel, for whose sake no one had to flee. 
About the departure of Link to Nuremberg and the appointment of 
Brisger to Altenburg.

Grace and peace! | believe and learn that the tyrants 
at court, after Frederick's death, are more submissive 
than before, and that they would rage more against the 
gospel than the Georgians,” if only they could. But what 
is in it? Therefore neither Joachim nor anyone else must 
flee until they are driven out by force. Christ still reigns in 
the midst of his enemies [Ps. 110, 2.], so that they grit 
their teeth and perish, and yet that is lost which they 
would gladly have [Ps. 112, 10.]. Enough has been said

If the Altenburgs want our prior, then it is necessary that 
they ask for him, because in the last letter of the prince to

To Johann Brismann in K6nigsberg. 


Luther responds to Brismann's letter of June 15. He reports 
that he had written two letters to Duke Albrecht. He reports that 
Carlstadt had been secretly received by him, but would not depart 
from his mind. He writes about the evil consequences of the 
peasants’ revolt, about his marriage, about the efforts of Duke 
Georg and others against the Gospel, and much more.

4) The date: post ascensionis [Mariae] is supposed to be in the 
original, which, as De Wette states, was in the Wallenrodt library 
in K6nigsberg, but is no longer available. Since the indication of a 
weekday is missing, so the date cannot be determined exactly, 
but De Wette's datirung: "16. August", will come close to the truth. 
Several times doubts have been raised against the correctness of 
this date, so by Seidemann in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 481, note 1, 
and for it: visitationis [Mariae], that is "after July 2" conjicirt, which 
we were also inclined to assume earlier (See St. Louis edition, vol. 
XX, introduction, p. 25 a). Now we have decided on the above 
date (which the Erl. Briefw. has also set), guided mainly by this 
consideration: On June 12, Carlstadt wrote from Frankfurt a. M. 
the exceedingly miserable letter No. 877 to Luther, which his wife 
delivered. The distance of Frankfurt from Wittenberg is in a 
straight line a little over 46 German geographical miles, which at 
that time could hardly be covered in less than eight days. This 
way had to be made three times, before Carlstadt could enter the 
asylum offered to him by Luther; so the presumable time of 
Carlstadt's arrival in Wittenberg is about the sixth of July. In this 
letter, however, already a longer presence of Carlstadt with Luther 
is presupposed.

when. | have written before about Martin Cellarius and 
now in more detail to Prince Albrecht, 1) at the same time 
about the establishment of the ceremonies, so | will be very 
brief to you, because | am overloaded with so many writings. 
If Carlstadt's or Zwingli's poison from the Sacrament should 
come to you, see that you are vigilant. The wretched man 2) 
has been secretly preserved with me. Now the whole world 
is too narrow for him; he is pursued everywhere in such a 
way that he has been forced to seek protection from his 
enemy. | have treated the man as kindly as | could and stood 
by him, but he does not leave his senses, even since he has 
been convicted, as this kind of spirits is wont to do. So 
beware of him and his teachings. | have found that 
everything in him is void, especially in this matter. 

Muenzer and the peasants have brought down the 
gospel so much in our country, and raised up the minds 
of the papists so much, that it seems that it must be raised 
up all over again. For this reason, | too have now testified 
to the Gospel not with words alone, but also with deeds, 
by taking a nun as my wife, in order to show my contempt 
for the triumphant and Jo! Jo! screaming enemies, so that 
it would not appear as if | had desisted. Although | am old 
and clumsy, if | can, | will also do other things that hurt 
those and confess the word.

1) These two letters are not available. 

2) homo miseris, as De Wette has already correctly indicated, 
Carlstadt, not Cellarius, whose alibi is proven from No. 876. 
Cellarius did not come to Wittenberg (as Seidemann, "Minzer", 
p. 97, states) in July 1525, but at the earliest in March 1526. The 
letter of Melanchthon to Brismann (Corp. Ref., vol. 1,755) 
mentioned (ibid. p. 98) is not written in August 1525, but in March 
1526 at the earliest. See St. Louis edition, vol. XX, introduction, 
pp. 24 f. Cellarius is not from Stargard, as the Corp. Ref. states, 
which we followed there, but from Stuttgart. 

3) namely at Dessau on July 19 (not, as Seidemann says in 
De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 481, note 1, on June 26). This also serves 
to confirm the date we have set. 








Johann has been approached by Duke Georg with great 
efforts, but he is still bravely standing firm, so that that 
person almost becomes nonsensical and wants to burst 
with anger. | believe that the Landgrave of Hesse is also 
still bravely standing firm, although he is being worked 
on by the Duke of Brunswick, the legate of the Council. 
The imperial cities are now holding consultations that 
they want to stay with the Gospel, even though the angry 
princes are threatening to the utmost. All in all, it looks 
as if a major war is about to break out, and that it will 
throw the godless princes to the ground if God does not 
protect them. 

Duke George thinks that, since Frederick is dead, he 
is able to do everything, but Christ laughs at him even 
more, and will laugh at him even more if you pray with 
us. The cause of the peasants has come to rest 
everywhere, 4) after about a hundred thousand have 
been slain, so many orphans made, but the rest so 
deprived in life that the appearance of Germany has 
never been more miserable. Thus the victors rage, so 
that they may complete their misdeeds.

Father, the Bishop of Samland. Since | could not write at

our answer and judgment, namely that everything that is 
discussed and stated in the booklet, pleases us almost 
well. It is also our coin and of the right blow, so that we 
have now circumvented and taught for five years, 
thanking God with joy that elsewhere there are such 
people who take the right truth so seriously and faithfully 
to heart, we are also certain that wherever the counsel 
comes, it shall stand with all honor, not only against the 
papists, but also against the infernal gates. We also want 
to stand by those who have proven such articles, as we 
have done and are obliged to do with our doctrine; for it 
is the right truth on which both your Lord and the Prince, 
who sent it to your Lord, comfortingly rely, as far as God 
gives us grace and strength. 


Except for the one article in which they resist the 
images, we do not hold with them at all; although we do 
not grant much to the idols, we do not consider them to 
be condemned, as if it were done against God, if 
someone has or has had images painted, since Christ 
also let the Emperor's coin go and also used it himself, 
since images were and still are standing. But because 
this booklet is a counsel and to be presented for a final 
judgment, we know not to blame the pious people's 
discretion and suggestion, first because they so 
Christianly offer to be instructed and taught, and for the 
sake of a small error such a dear good booklet is not to 
be despised. This we have answered to your lordship's 
writing and command with submissive diligence, and we 
ask that it be sent or judged in your lordship's favor and 
grace, as God will grant. Date Wednesday after Egydi

The Council of Erfurt to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


On May 10, 1525, the council of Erfurt had invited Luthern and 
Melanchthon in writing (See St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 113 f., no. 
775) to come there to discuss certain articles handed over to 
them by the subjects. Neither of them came. Now the council 
sends these articles to Luther with the request to give his opinion 
about them. Luther complied with this request in his reply to this 
letter on September 19, 1525.

1) The proof that Carlstadt wrote this letter in Luther's house 
we believe to have provided in the 20th volume of our edition, 
Introduction, p. 24 f.. That Cellarius could not be the homo miser 
mentioned in No. 898, results from the letter of Paul Speratus to 
Luther of June 11 (No. 876); therefore, only Carlstadt remains, 
who can be meant by this designation. Although the Erl. Briefw. 
still firmly insists (Vol. V, p. 228, Note 4) on Luther's letter to 
Brismann (No. 898) that homo miser does not refer to Carlstadt, 
but to Cellarius, he nevertheless feels prompted here to ask: "or 
did Carlstadt write this letter in Luther's house?" Furthermore, he 
brings the following quotation from the writing of Alberus "Wider 
die verfluchte lere" 2c., BI. liij: "But because D. Martinus neglects 
to obtain genade for Carlstad from the Elector, he writes to 
Carlstad that he should come and be with him secretly until he 
obtains genade from the Elector that he may be in the country. 
Carlstad came and was for some time secretly in D. Martini's 
house, which no one knew, without D. Martini's faithful famulus 
Wolff (Sieberger), who secretly brought him food."

Carlstadt receives pardon from the Elector and permission to 
settle in the Saxon lands, but with the exception of the Thuringian 
lands and Wittenberg. The place of residence to be chosen 
should not be further away from Wittenberg than about three 
miles. Kemberg is expressly excluded, because a country road 
leads through it.

First, our dear devout Magister Spalatinus shall give 
our gracious greeting to our also dear devout Ern Martino 
Luter. 

And thereafter notify him of the following opinion: that 
we have read the writings which he wrote a few days ago 
on behalf of Doctor Carolstat, and which he especially 
addressed to us, together with the excuse of the 
suspicion,”) concerning the peasant rebellion, and that 
the said Doctor Carolstat has recognized his error, and is 
inclined to recant and revoke the same to the glory and 
praise of God Almighty and for the salvation of his soul, 
that we gladly heard this, and also received a special joy 
and pleasure from it out of Christian kinship and duty. 
And since we as a Christian prince, as we would like to 
be felt and noted, recognize ourselves guilty, and are 
also inclined to forgive those who have acted or broken 
against our person, and to communicate mercy to them, 
as we are aware of that of God, our Creator, and ask for 
it daily, we want to forgive the aforementioned Doctor 
Carolstat all that, so and whether he has acted against 
our person,” for the sake of God and His mercy. But what

The Eternal God has called us to this office, from 
which we owe and are obligated to punish those who 
have acted contrary to the outward peace, and who 
have done so in fact, and who do not refuse to 
prosecute others who request such our office in equity 
and justice, and in this we want to show ourselves, if 
God wills it, no other way than as we know how to 
answer for it before God and the world, and to put him 
off 1) to the apology for it that has been sent over, We 
have also put him off herewith, that he will not do 
anything wrong for us and ours, whom we have the 
power to do and leave for our sake, and that no 
punishment will be inflicted on him with our knowledge 
or will, except according to the order and the power of 
the law, and that his answer and others will hear his 
need for it, and that he will be overcome, as is just and 
right. Nor shall we be displeased, insofar as his 
retraction and objection are sufficient, that he remain 
in our principality and abstain therein, but in such a 
way that he does not enter our Thuringian (duringian) 
lands outside our foreknowledge, nor does he touch 
them. But around Wittenberg on a half, whole, two to 
the third mile of it he may sit down or settle down in 
spots or villages according to his opportunity, only 
Kemberg excluded. And that we are not inclined to 
tolerate Doctor Carolstad in Kemberg is due to the fact 
that a road to Leipzig, the Mark, Pomerania and other 
ends passes through there, which is built and 
wandered by some and partly strange people 3); since 
we want to know him for moving reasons as little as in 
Wittenberg with beings. And so he shall keep it, until 
further our permission or business. And so that his 
letter, petition and request may be answered, it is our 
gracious request, where Doctor Carolstat is to be 
found so recently, that such may be held before him 
without special delay, that Doctor Martinus, in addition 
to Magister Spalatin, notify him of the above opinion 
of ours and give him an answer, If, however, he is not 
to be found in such a way as touched, that Doctor 
Martinus alone will do this, then we will graciously 
provide for him that he will not be lacking in this, and 
this will be done for our gracious favor.

September 19, 1525. 


To the City Council of Erfurt. 


Luther gives his expert opinion on the articles sent to him by 
the council. 


(Wittenberg. 


Printed in Fortgesetzten Sammlung von alten und neuen 
theologischen Sachen, 1723, p. 1025; in K. F. Lossius, "Helms 
Eoban Hesse und seine Zeitgenossen". Gotha 1797. 8. p. 305;

280, No. 48 (according to an inaccurate copy from the 17th 
century); in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 59 and in the 
Erlangen edition twice, namely vol. 56, p. XII, No. 836 (incorrect 
as to Lang and the other Erfurt preachers) and vol. 65, p. 238. - 
In the prints, the letter is dated soon "Tuesday", soon "Thursday" 
after Lamberti, which is Sept. 19 and 21. To designate the latter 
date, which coincides with St. Matthew's Day, Luther would 
probably have applied the latter; therefore, we take the former. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, careful, dear 
gentlemen! | have received your writing together with the 
articles, and | am now glad that God has not permitted 
my future to you, for the articles are in part so clumsy 
that | could have done little good, or perhaps made the 
matter worse. It seems as if they were made by those 
who are too comfortable and have thought that there is 
no one in heaven and earth who is not afraid of them. 
And where | would be mighty in Erfurts, | would not let 
any of the articles be good, although some would be 
good in them, but, as punishment for such outrageous 
presumption and outrageousness, all such articles 
would have to suffer and bear reproach. Nothing is 
sought in it, but that each one may have his benefit, and 
live according to his will, the lowest to the highest, and 
turn everything around, that the council may fear the 
community and be a servant, and that the community 
may be lord and master and fear no one, which is against 
God and reason. Then | should have a fine city, so that 
tomorrow the houses would lie on top of each other. For 
this reason, | Know nothing to answer E. W.'s articles, 
except to admonish the community to be quiet and to 
entrust everything to an honorable council for 
improvement; and to ask God to give grace and reason 
to carry this out well, so that the princes are not caused 
by such clumsy actions and have to harm the city of 
Erfurt.

and drive out the Kitzel. Is that evangelical, that is, 
wanting to go through with one's head, without all humility 
and prayer before God's eyes, just as if Erfurt should not 
be God's, or God were not also Lord over Erfurt? | do not 
see any article on how one should first fear God, seek 
Him, ask Him, call upon Him, and command Him in the 
matter. And that | stir some: Is it not rebellious that the 
parishes 1) want to elect and de-select parish priests| 
themselves, regardless of the council, as if the council as 
the authorities had no interest in what they did in the city? 
Item, that they do not want to give any more interest, but 
to settle the sum. Rather, if | wanted to live off the sum 
annually, | would keep it with me. What may | do with it to 
another? as if | were a child, and let another deal with it. 
Who wants to command his summa to you for his own 
sake in such a way that you give it to him yearly and 


piecemeal? This is so gross that it is too much. The same| 9 


applies to not giving the princes protection money. They 
hold peace and security in such low esteem, which 
cannot be paid for with any money. Finally, | am sending 
the same article to E. W. again with an indication of my 
hand about some, because a lot of quite worldly business 
is involved, in which it is not my place to judge nor to 
advise. Nor can |. | am ready to serve you. Hiemit GOtt 
befehlt, Amen. Tuesday after Lamberti [Sept. 19] Anno 
1525. 
Martin Luther. 2) 


The following 


List of articles, so all quarters of the city of Erfurt 
sammt the crafts therein belonging to further 
improvement have discussed. 


In the first article, concerning pastors, it is 
considered good that they be divided into various 
parishes according to the circumstances in the city, 
and that a congregation of the same parish appoint 
and remove its pastor, and that through the same 
appointed pastor the pure Word of God be clearly 
presented, without any addition of all kinds of human 
commandments, statutes, and doctrines concerning 
the conscience. 


1) "Parishes" put by us instead of: "Parish priests”. 
2) In Seidemann, the name is spelled "Lauther" throughout. 
3) Seidemann: "most convenient". 


Letters from the year 1525. no. 909. 


785 


Martinus Luther. 
However, the council shall have the supremacy to 
know what kind of persons have offices in the city. 


On the other hand, from the unmistakable interest, 

By which we hear the re-purchase or usurious 
interest, if the main sum has fallen again home, also 
often to the abundance, which interest one no longer 
intends to give. However, if the principal sum is not 
paid, the remainder, which is not paid, shall be made 
merry and paid for a reasonable period of time. We 
also ask that the coinage and bills of exchange be 
looked into. 


Martinus Luther. 
In fact, nothing better, one gives interest to the 
summa, because it is preserved in Erfurt. 


Thirdly, from the gate interest, since the free of is 
iven. 

They shall be abolished, so that he, 4) who has 
had the gate rent, shall take the same free pennies 
with the right to receive the same. This shall be further 
dealt with, namely in free interest. 

Martinus Luther. 
| do not know what it is. If it is harmful according to the 
council's knowledge, then one humbly asks that it be 
stopped, if not, that one patiently suffers it, and thanks 
God that one lives and nourishes oneself in peace. 


Fourthly, from the withdrawn goods of a. The first 
of these is wood, water, and the like. 

The first is to be used by a community, but the 
second is to be used by a community, but the first is 
to be used by a community, but the second is to be 
used by a community, but the first is to be used by a 
community, but the first is to be used by a community. 


Martinus Luther. 
This shall not be, but the authorities shall sell it for the 
benefit of the common city. 


To the fifth of wills or foundation of altars, 

Where these exist, they shall henceforth no longer 
follow, namely the clergy, but the heirs and devisees 
from whom they flowed. But where the heirs and 
devisees are not found, such endowments shall then 
be placed in a common box. 


4) Seidemann: "your". 


786 


Martinus Luther. 

The persons who have them now 1) shall be left to 
enjoy them until they die, otherwise the person and the 
interest shall be under the authority of the council. 
Otherwise, let them be commanded by God, if the heirs 
are quite poor and meager. 


To the sixth from the council. 

That one has a perpetual council, which annually 
gives account to the guardians of the quarters and 
crafts of the community, which are not to be of the 
council, if it is recognized useful. 

Martinus Luther. 

Where one does not trust a council, why does one set 

one and not rather leave none? 


To the seventh. 
That the current council give an account of all 
expenditures and revenues. 
Martinus Luther. 
And that the council is not the council, but the mob 
rules everything. 


To the eighth. 
Item, that all kinds of merchant business are free 
to any citizen who is able to do so. 
Martinus Luther. 
So that no poor person may remain before the rich, 
nor feed. 


To the ninth. 
Item, that every citizen is free to brew, who has 
house and yard and is manable. 


Martinus Luther. 
So that the rich alone may remain brewers in the end. 


To the tithe. 

Item to give a full quarter for his money. Martin 
Luther. 

Isn't that how it used to be? 


To the eleventh. 

Item, that every one be allowed freely to work his 
craft, unhindered by the guild, who does there civic 
duty, and who has kept himself honest and 
respectable for his person. 

Martinus Luther. 
| leave that to the judgment of the council. 


1) Seidemann: "lift". 


Letters from the year 1525. No. 909. 


787 


To the twelfth. 

Item, that any matter, which comes before an 
honorable council, which decision is included in the 
city book, shall be paid without any delay within 
fourteen days on request in the own person of the 
citizens. If, however, the citizen is not able to present 
his case, an honorable council shall assign one of the 
council members to present his case, so that further 
expenses of the citizens are avoided. 

Martinus Luther. 
It is also worldly and does not concern my teaching. 


To the thirteenth. 
Item, to look into the scribes, to make an order, so 
that no one is taken over, as has happened so far. 
Martinus Luther. 
Him too. 


To the fourteenth. 

Item, action with the House of Saxony to have a 
gracious remission of the protection money half. 

Martinus Luther. 

Yes, so that no one protects the city of Erfurt, or that 
the princes still add money and still protect. | would like 
to know whether Erfurt also invests money better, 
because so that it buys protection and peace. 


To the fifteenth. 

Item, after the citizens and compatriots are highly 
complained with the escort, that in this also a gracious 
understanding is attained. 


Martinus Luther. 
Yes, God grant that it is a pity for princes and councils 
that we have only our will. 


To the Sixteenth and Seventeenth. 

Item, that henceforth obviously all boys and girls of 
all classes are no longer tolerated, nor the common 
house of the common women. 

Item, all those who are indebted to the council and 
the community, retardata or otherwise, shall be 
faithfully admonished, he be who he will. 


Martinus Luther. 
| guess those two are going. 


To the eighteenth. 
Item, with all diligence we ask and desire, together 
with the countryside, that no one be obliged to

Letters from the year 


The court shall not imprison any citizen or 
countryman, but shall let any man come to his 
answer, unless he is to be punished in the flesh. 
Martinus Luther. 
Where the council recognizes this as good. 


To the nineteenth. 
That also all citizens, so entangled in Erfurt, shall 
be counted loose on honest answer. 
Martinus Luther. 
At the pleasure of the council. 


For the twentieth. 

Whether also some citizens in or after the 
indignation refer and could indicate their innocence, 
are to be left to their answer. 

Martinus Luther. 

It's cheap. 


To the twenty-first. 

Also, henceforth, the council shall not establish an 
essay 1) without the knowledge and will of the entire 
community and countrymen. 

Martinus Luther. 


It would be necessary to pay the people. 


To the twenty-second. 
Item that ask outside the gates to give their grown 
wine in the suburbs. 
Martinus Luther. 
Then the council realized what was best. 


To the twenty-third. 

Item, our request is to strive conducively so that a 
laudable university, as held before, may be 
established. 

Martinus Luther. 

This is the very best. 


To the twenty-fourth. 
Item, that no one is endangered because of this 
action. 2) 
Martinus Luther. 
That is also good, because many may mean well, the 
others are to be thanked and admonished to desist from 
their pretentiousness. 


1) "Essay" edition, tax. 
2) "on account of this act", that is, on account of putting these 
articles. 


1525. no. 909. 910. 789 

For the twenty-fifth. 

Item, because all the charges and complaints are 
over, that an honorable council would want to have 
attention, that meat and bread would become quite a 
purchase. 

Martinus Luther. 

Otherwise, a council should do this out of duty and 

office. 


To the twenty-sixth. 
Item, the foreign bakers and butchers may have 
the week two days feil. 
Martinus Luther. 


The council is watching. 


To the twenty-seventh. 

Item, all goods, which were taken from the 
common city and which were given to an honorable 
council, projectile, interest, wages and what is, also 
want to come back to the common city, as namely 
Melchendorf, Gispersleben, the half of Kiliani, as 
before. 

Martinus Luther. 


God and the council will help. 


To the twenty-eighth. 

Item, that everyone may use the pasture, who is a 
citizen, to his neighbor without harm. 

Martinus Luther. 
Let that remain with the council's findings. 
Martinus Luther ultimately displayed. 

Item, One article is forgotten, that an honorable 
council does nothing, has no power, nothing is trusted to 
him, but sits there like an idol and Zifra,®) and lets the 
community chew on him like a child, and thus governs 
with bound hands and feet, and the wagon leads the 
horses, and the horses bridle and drive the wagoner, then 
it will go well, according to the laudable example of these 
articles.

To the honorable and prudent gentlemen, mayor and 
council of the laudable city of Nuremberg, my 
favorable dear sirs. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, prudent, wise, 
dear gentlemen! | add to E. W.'s complaint that some 
sixths of the postilion still in print have been secretly 
stolen from our printers here, more than half of the book, 
and brought to your noble city, and hastily reprinted, sold, 
before ours is finished, and thus, with the completed 
book, led ours into noticeable damage, and it is right for 
me that the Hergetlein should also be on it. They are not 
satisfied with this and will continue to wait for it, if they get 
the other and the rest, and have also ordered to reprint in 
a hurry, as they did before, and even ruin us in the ground. 
Other cities on the Rhine do not do so, and even if they 
did, we would not be harmed, because their printing does 
not come in and is driven, like yours, for the sake of 
proximity. Now we have watched long enough, until [it] 
has at last become unmistakable, also so far one of the 
causes has been, that | have not been allowed to attack 
the prophets, lest | give cause to their ruin, and thus by 
avarice and envy divine Scripture is prevented and must 
remain, and that by fault of your laudable city citizens, 
which is ever an unfriendly neighborhood, so near one 
beer sticks out to the other to spite and harm. So it is 
pathetic enough that | have such work, which makes me 
heartily sour, and yet | like to do it for the benefit of 
common Christianity, nothing to speak of without glory, 
and still have to add to it, even though a book ever 
confesses to three or four kinds of work, and should not 
earn so much with the people that the printers are not put 
down and spoiled for me. They have done well, may not 
dare to work on it, have obtained it through thieves, it is 
no different than if it were stolen from one on the street or 
in the house; we poor have to suffer it, are banished. Now 
| would be well satisfied that | am urged by such a cause 
to keep quiet, but for the sake of others | speak, and that 
the holy scripture is prevented by such perfidy of the devil. 
Moreover, that my books are commonly corrected 


Letters from the year 1525. No. 910 to 913. 





791 


and corrupted in other printings. Therefore, it is my very 
friendly request that E. W. would do a Christian service 
here and have an eye on your printers so that they do not 
graze such important books after ours to their detriment; 
that they wait no longer, that they wait seven or eight 
weeks, so that ours also have bread next to them and are 
not so shamefully robbed of theirs by them. Where this 
does not help, | must admonish such robbers and thieves 
by public notice, and yet | would gladly not have to name 
your praiseworthy city. But whether they say: they must 
feed themselves. Yes, without harming others, and not in 
such a way as to steal and rob from them, as they would 
have others do. | also know well that the Coburgers 1) 
have lost many books, as other printers have more: but 
what can we do about it? should they take such revenge 
on us, who have never sought their damage with our 
books? but God has so sent that these have fallen off and 
are torn, as is otherwise more common in other

To Nicolaus Hausmann in Zwickau. 


Luther says that he cannot do anything else because of his 
writing against Erasmus. He would not answer Zwingli and 
Oecolampad. Carlstadt would, as he hoped, get up again, get 
along, and come back into favor with the prince.

His Nicolaus Hausmann, Bishop of the Church at 

Zwickau, his [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | hope that my letter has come to 
you, my dear Nicolaus. Now | say briefly: during the time 
that |am at Erasmus, 1) | am not able to do anything else; 
when this is finished, | will attend to the things of which 
you write. Zwingli and Oecolampad attack us, but | will 
leave this to others, or rather, they will be despised. 
Satan is nonsensical everywhere, but Christ is wise and 
strong. Carlstadt will rise again through our good deeds 
(as | hope) and, having come to his senses, will again 
obtain favor with the prince through Christ's help. 2) What 
will they say then? Farewell in Christ, my dearest 
Nicolaus. Now | will become an abbot of the nuns. Christ 
wills it so. In haste.

He has been sucking his fingers for a long time and is 
without office. What shall | praise his faithfulness, his skill

praised by the most excellent [physicians] of our

only for the sake of his advantage, but also so that 
Zwickau would be best advised and provided with a man

contribute something so that he would be brought there,

To His Lord Gottschalk, Evangelist at Celle in the 
LUneburg Lands. 


Grace and peace in Christ! | write little, my dear 
Gottschalk, since | am very busy. | have received only this 
one letter from you after Duke Otto’) was here. But | 
sympathize with you, who are so plagued by new spirits; 
but be strong, the Lord will help you with his strength. 
Zwingli's reason for the certainty of faith may not move 
you, for he speaks of faith only according to what he has 
heard and invented himself, without any experience. It is 
possible, indeed it happens daily, that we are firm in some 
articles of faith and weak in others. Moses, the man of 
such great faith, was left at the water of the Hader as a 
weak one [Deut. 20:13], then all the children of Israel 
became weak in the faith of sustenance and food, while 
they had overcome Pharaoh with so many miracles in 
faith. Then not everything that is accepted by the papists 
is suspicious, otherwise the baptism and the whole Bible 
would also be suspicious. It is more suspicious that, 
Carlstadt was the first to put forward that opinion, the 
reasons for which Zwingli and Oecolampad completely’ 
reject, and yet try to defend the opinion with other 
reasons, and the foolish people only put forward 
Carlstadt's most important reasons, which they rejected. 
This is a ridiculous spirit to me, which first puts forward 
some article with trivial reasons, and then with the 
promise of other reasons almost extols the same, and 
thus argues completely against itself. Those people 
argue about the honor of this doctrine. | do not see 
anything else there, but in the sequel you will perhaps see 
something else. In the meantime, insist on the right 
opinion. May the Lord help you with his grace, Amen.

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear sirs! 
| have no other answer to your letter, because of the

public pressure in such cases: namely, where the 
monastery is abandoned, the city or lordship must take 
the houses and turn them to good use, but the property 
and interest, where poor and meager heirs are the 
founders, that one lets the same go, or becomes them in 
part now. For this reason, it is at my discretion that you 
make a friendly agreement with the nobility, whether they 
want to cede all or part of their parents' endowments and 
thus contribute to God's work. Such a thing is right and

To the "most illustrious, highborn" Prince and Lord, 
Lord John, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c., 


Landgrave in Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, 
my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | humbly request that E. C. 
F. G. graciously grant me that | often have to bring trouble 
and unpleasantness to the court with writings, 
considering that | certainly have nothing to gain from it, 
because trouble and unpleasantness are also enough, 
and would gladly spare E. C. F. G., but because | am of 
such standing and respect, | cannot be overburdened. 

First of all, G. H., | apologize for having suggested so 
hard to ordain the university, because | heard how E. C. 
F. G. was almost disconcerted by my so diligent activity, 
as if | should not have believed E. C. F. G.'s promises 
much; now it is not that | should not believe E. C. F. G., 
because if that were the case, | would have left my 
suggestion pending out of doubt; but because | had no 
doubt about E. C. F. G.'s promises. C. F. G.'s promises, 
that is why | made sure that [it] would not be delayed by 
superfluous business, as has happened many times to 
our most gracious lords 2c. before; for lords' trousers 
have a lot to do, and it is necessary to stop there, as they 
say; so | was also urged by others, because the people 
got lost and the school split up, that haste was necessary. 

But as for all that, even if | had offended against E. C. 
F. G. with mistrust, such a sin should not grieve me too 
much, considering the good work that has resulted, 1) 
which is probably worth more of such a sin, and would 
like to sin even more so against E. C. F. G., where | could 
create such good, the comforting confidence that E. C. F. 
G. will not only forgive such a sin, but also forgive me 
myself. C. F. G., where | could create such good, the 
comforting confidence, E. C. F. G. will not only graciously 
forgive me such, but will also be pleased with it himself, 
because it is certain and cannot be otherwise. 


1) Joh. von Dolzig reports on October 25 to a friend about the 
negotiations on the basis of the Instruction of Sept. 17 (No. 908): 
"It has come about according to the advice and goodwill of the 
unanimous will, as the four patrons have considered it Christian, 
necessary and certain, namely the Babst Martinus, the Probst 
(Jonas), Pomeranus, the parish priest, and Philippus, so it has 
been decided and finally passed in the case." 


800 


because E. C. F. G. must feel in her heart that such work 
is good and pleases God; and although she seeks 
neither merit nor reward in it, much less glory or honor 
before the world, yet her conscience must rejoice and be 
strengthened in the faith that God has accomplished 
such good through E. C. F. G. and has used her as an 
instrument, and has indicated that she intends to use him 
further for His divine will, which we sincerely wish for. C. 
F. G. has accomplished such good, and has used him as 
an instrument, and has indicated that he intends to use 
him further for his divine gracious will, which we sincerely 
ask and wish, amen. 

Accordingly, G. H., because the university is now in 
its order, and the order of the church service is also now 
being established, and should continue, there are still 
two things that demand E. C. F. G., as secular authority, 
understanding and order. The first, that the parishes 
everywhere are so miserable, since no one gives, no one 
pays. Sacrifices and pensions have fallen, interest is not 
there, or too little, so the common man respects neither 
preachers nor pastors, that, where there is not a brave 
order and good preservation of the parishes and 
preachers' chairs made by E. C. F. G., in a short time 
there will be neither parsonage, nor schools, nor 
students, and thus God's word and service will fall to the 
ground. Therefore, E. C. F. G. wants to continue to be 
used by God, and to be His faithful instrument, for more 
comfort, also for E. C. F. G.'s own conscience, because 
she is asked and required to do so by us and by the need 
itself, as certainly by God. E. C. F. G. will certainly find 
the means to do so. There are monasteries, convents, 
fiefdoms and donations, and there are enough of these 
things, where only C.F.G.'s order can be given. F. G.'s 
order to look at them, to calculate and to arrange them. 
God will also give His blessing and prosperity to this, so 
that, if God wills, the order concerning the souls, as the 
high school and divine service, will not be prevented for 
lack and abandonment of the poor belly, we also ask for 
His divine grace, amen. 

The other piece, that E. C. F. G., as | once talked to 
E. C. F. G. in Wittenberg, would also have the secular 
regiment visited, and how councillors in cities and all 
other officials governed and presided over the common 
good; for there is great complaint everywhere about evil 
regiment, both in cities and in the countryside, in which 
E. C. F. G. would have the same effect. C. F. G., as a 
head and a countryman

The court would perhaps have fewer notes, things and 
complaints if such a visitation and good order could be 
carried out in a proper manner. E. C. F. G. would 
graciously accept all this from me as a submissive 
suggestion, because E. C. F. G. sees and notices that | 
mean well. God graciously grant this in E. C. F. G.'s heart 
with complete light and power to do what pleases Him, 
Amen. At Wittenberg, Tuesday after Simonis and Jude

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! We inform you that he Andres Stolp, pastor of 
Niemeck, has previously reported to us the damage he 
suffered from the fire that burned down his parish there, 
with the request that we would dispose of it with those of 
Niemeck, because he could not now maintain himself with 
them due to the fire damage he received, We also ask 
that, in order that he may enjoy his loss to some extent 
and receive it to a greater extent, he be given something 
to reimburse him and that he be paid an annual pension 
from the income of the affected parish. Thereupon we 
wrote to those of Niemeck, if it would not be burdensome 
for them or something would be on him, that they would 
let the said priest appoint another priest to the parish or 
would lend and give him a fief or something else for his 
damage, with a request, where he would indicate that the 
damage was done to him by someone of Niemeck, that 
he should be helped in equity. Hereupon the council of 
Niemeck came to us with the enclosed letter, as you will 
hear from it. Now we have sent such a letter of the council 
to the mentioned pastor's copy, and the complaints that 
Niemeck has made to us about him before, have been 
shown next to it. Since it can be considered manly that it 
is almost burdensome for the people that they should be 
provided with a tenant and not with their own pastor, our 
gracious request is that you think of a suitable one, who 
may preside over the poor people with the word of God, 
as befits a pastor, and inform us of the same, and we will 
have him ordained and assigned to the von Niemeck as 
a pastor. We did not want to restrain you from this, and 
do us a gracious favor. Date Torgau, Tuesday after

To the honorable and prudent Lasaro Spengler, 
Syndico of the city of Nuremberg, my favorable 
master and friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, prudent, dear 
sir and friend! Here in Wittenberg we have problems with 
printing, as you know, and | have previously written to the 
council in Nuremberg that the printers and accountants 
have made a fuss about our printers, and are showing 
them all mischievousness and wickedness. Now this 
prevents me from doing all the prophets, postils, Latin 
bibles and other great works, nor from continuing, 
although | would gladly have such work for my own sake, 
and would know how to use that malice for my rest 1). So 
there are now some printers on the Rhine who are willing 
to enter into an alliance with my printers, so that such evil 
may be controlled. But because the Koburger has 
recently spoken to me, and | then offered what | could, | 
should not lack anything: according to the promise, as | 
remember, | have undertaken and stopped my printers, 
and suggested whether they wanted or would like to 
suffer the Koburger in such an alliance and trade, should 
perhaps be more useful and beneficial for both parts. 
Accordingly, my request and friendly request is, if it would 
not be too difficult for you, to let such my letter reach the 
Koburger, and to advise therein what would be the best

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! You wrote to us last week, apologizing, among 
other things, for having made so many suggestions to us 
about the university order. We have read your letter with 
further contents and are graciously and well satisfied with 
your apology, because we know what you did in the same 
matter, that it was well meant by you and done in the best 
way. 

And when you further indicate that the parishes 
everywhere are so miserable, so that no one gives 
anything, paid, to that that sacrifice and soul pennies 
have fallen, that it is due to us, as the secular authority, 
to establish and make order, so that the pastors and 
preachers receive properly. Now it may well be that the 
sacrifices and the like of the common access of the’ 
parishes and preachers have fallen, and that the people 
with the interest, rents and the like, which they gave 
before age, will leave something to be done. Should we 
now provide for the same parishes and preachers from 
the income of our office and chamber property, it will be 
difficult for us, as you can see. However, we believe that 
it is nevertheless proper for the citizens of the cities, as 
well as those in the countryside, to do something from 
their own property or from the ecclesiastical fiefs that they’ 
have to lend, so that

the pastors and preachers, who preach the Word of God 
to them and administer the holy sacraments, could 
maintain themselves all the more nobly. And it is our 
gracious request that you inform us of your concern, as 
you think, that where the pastors and preachers are not 
provided for their needs and entertainment, an order 
should be made and established for them, [so] we want 
to show ourselves further in this by the bestowal of divine 
grace, and also have the appointment that the interest 
and other things, which are dedicated and suitable for 
this, should be given to the same pastors and preachers 
undiminished. 

Concerning the third article, as to visit the secular 
regiment, how the councils in cities and the officials 
govern, of which you spoke to us once before in 
Wittenberg, we do not want to reproach you in your 
gracious opinion that we recently filled some of our offices 
anew with officials, We are of the opinion that our 
subjects and relatives in the cities and in the countryside 
should find help, advice and comfort in their matters with 
the same, so that their afflictions and objections can be 
remedied in an equitable manner. Some time ago we 
would have been inclined to decree in all our offices and 
cities, and to hear how their order and government was; 
but it remained primarily because of the uprising that had 
occurred a while ago, and also because of other matters 
that we were responsible for; but we want to do it with 
God's help at another time according to our opportunity, 
and also do that which serves God's praise and for the 
free spreading of His holy word and common benefit, and 
also for good order. We do not want to restrain you in 
your gracious opinion, because we are inclined to you 
with grace. Date Torgau, Tuesday after Leonhardi [Nov.

Grace and peace! How gladly | would like to be at your

Erasmus should not also be forced to be subservient to

new unrest; the nobles, who are ignoble at heart, are 
raging. And it is to be wondered at how one must not 
believe even those who have hitherto been regarded as 
the evangelicals. Amsdorf himself was recently in danger 
with those of whom we ourselves believed with him® that 
they would be our castles and our refuge if it should be 
necessary. Amsdorf's statement was this: "They are 
knaves not only before God, but also before the world." 
You would be surprised if | were allowed to entrust their 
names to the letter. This is the reason that | am held back 
by the tears of my Kathe (Katenae), that | do not go to 
you, since she believes that you want nothing less, as dll 
also write, than my danger. For she disputes so: 
Amsdorf's reputation is indeed very important to me. 
Then you know how much our present prince cares for 
the gospel; he is all the less to be feared by his own, 
because they hope that words can easily be put before 
him, whatever they may have taken for themselves. 

To the question whether it is a prince's right to abolish 
abominations, when the adversaries assert that no one 
must be forced to faith and the gospel; then, that there is 
no example for this; finally, that the princes have the right 
to rule only in outward things: you can answer why they 
do not themselves do so first, as they now finally 
conclude? for they do not only force outward 
abominations, but also inward unbelief and godlessness 
of heart. Therefore they may suffer, at least in part, the 
measure with which they measure. That they are 
coercive, however, is sufficiently evident from the fact 
that they invoke a foreign prince, by which alone they fully 
deserved to be expelled. Then our princes do not compel 
to faith and the gospel, but curb outward abominations. 
Since they themselves confess that the princes have a 
right in external things, they condemn themselves. For 
the princes must prevent public outrages, as perjuries, 
public blasphemies of the name of God, such as these 
are, by doing nothing. 


4) We do not consider it permissible to refer ipso to the 
Churfirst, as the Erl. Briefw. does. Amsdorf is meant by this. 


808 


Those who are prevented may believe or not believe, 
even if they blaspheme secretly or not. For we say of 
public revilings and blasphemies, with which they revile 
our God. Here (I say) we must, if we can, prevent them; 
if we cannot, we are forced to let it go. Here no one is 
yet forced to faith and gospel, no one is forced to an 
ungodly opinion of the heart, as they would do if they 
could; 1) now that they cannot do it, they agree with them 
and justify them, therefore they are worthy of equal 
punishment, Rom. 1. | believe that this is a sufficiently 
great example, that Christ made scourges and by force 
drove the sellers and the buyers out of the temple. 
Therefore, continue, and do not be moved by the talk of 
those people, and be at ease with your Lord and your 
bride. Since Magister Eberhard 2) is coming, | will honor 
your little wedding as much as | can. On St. Martin's Day

Dear devotees, councilors and faithful! A woman

complaint about how she had trusted one of our 
servants at Wittenberg, called Lang Jérgen, in 
marriage, and how she had also been with him in 
marriage for a good time, and because of this he had 
repudiated her and given him another woman to 
marry and trust. If such a deal, where the wife did not 
give him cause for it through adultery or inequity, 
would not cause us unreasonable complaint and 
displeasure, then our council and dear faithful, 
Christiano Beyer, Doctor, and Anthonien Nimeck, 
both mayors of Wittenberg, have sent the women's 
complaint to me and ordered them to humble the 
woman and the said Langen Jérgen before them, to 
hear them against each other, and otherwise to 
inquire about these matters, and if they then find that 
the woman has not caused the man by the adultery,

that he may by divine right take another to show 
himself further, as touched our order brought with it. 
That we now gave such an order to these two mayors 
is due to the fact that we considered it as if Lang J6rg, 
out of his own will and without prior knowledge, might 
have undertaken to take the other wife. For if the 
woman had indicated in her complaint, 1) that the 
other marriage in question had taken place with the 
foreknowledge of the venerable, our dear devout Ern 
Johansen Bugenhagen, pastor at Wittenberg, and on 
the latter's inquiry, we would have known how to show 
ourselves just with such an order. Although we have 
now ordered our commissioners to inquire about the 
matter, which they have done, as we can see from the 
papers they have received, 1) when they were sent 
back here, we would not have made any mistake, 
where they found in the interrogation held or 
otherwise that the said priest had inquired to some 
extent before the other marriage, as it was about the 
first wife's trial, that they would have proceeded with 
imprisonment outside our further order 2). Because 
they indicate in their report, among other things, that 
the priest was present during their interrogation, and 
that the same 3)) gave us information about the 
captured farmhand, what he had done with the other 
woman before she was entrusted to him, and what 
form he had taken, which we are sending to you 
herewith, and find that the evidence taken by the two 
mayors, and before that by the priest, is not 
consistent, and that there is not only a deficiency in 
this, but also that some witnesses who were present 
at the trial, and who were not present at the first trial, 
are not in agreement, that some of the witnesses, 
whom the priest interrogated before the hearing, 
wavered in their testimonies before both mayors and 
changed their first speech, but some, whom the priest 
interrogated at the same time, in addition to the pre- 
determined ones, who were not even decided by the 
mayors in the opinion that they are to be believed, but 
other and new witnesses were interrogated against 
them, so that we do not know how things stand on all 
sides: We therefore request that you first of all 
diligently review the reports that have been submitted 
to us by both parties, and note which of the people 
who were interrogated by the priest and both mayors 
said something repugnant in their testimonies, and 
then examine the

3) "the same" (namely Bugenhagen) put by us instead of: "the

Witnesses all together, who interrogated them on 
both sides, and who especially changed their 
testimony in the interrogation of the mayors, shall 
present themselves to you hurriedly and without 
warning, and demand that they come to you one after 
the other, read to them their speech and testimony, 
as they should have done first before the priest, 
according to his list sent over, and then before the two 
mayors, according to their list, and remind them of the 
repugnancy which they had shown in their testimony, 
and hear which report they give by chance, and say 
that they had testified before. and hear what report 
they will give by chance, and say that they had 
testified before. After that, those, and each one in 
particular, whom the priest interrogated and who 
remained unquestioned by both mayors, shall also be 
interrogated, upon the priest's instruction, as to what 
they should have said before; and then, finally, those 
whom the mayors interrogated and who were not 
questioned by the priest. And what they will say of all 
parts, you want to record, but bind each witness, if he 
goes from you, to say nothing of what you hold 
against him. If you then find from all this, and also 
from other reports which you will know how to take, 
where the necessity of the trade requires it, that the 
presumption is in favor of the landowner and against 
the first wife, then both of you, Hans von Doltzigk and 
Hans von Grevendorf, shall then decree, that the land 
servant, upon guarantee or vow to reinstate himself 
when required, come out of prison, but in the event of 
a countermove let him remain there, and report to all 
four of us in writing how you found things, and also 
report your concerns as to what should be done in this 
matter as far as the marriage is concerned. And since 
the two mayors indicate what impropriety should 
result from the fact that in Wittenberg the divorce is 
being handled somewhat improperly, and the persons 
are being secretly brought together in the houses 
without prior order, we request that you, Doctor

God's grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, 
Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! E. C. F. G. have 
answered my suggestion to provide the parishes 
everywhere. Now this is not my opinion that all parishes 
should be appointed from E. C. F. G. Chamber". But 
because E. C. F. G. graciously requests my concern as 
to how it should be done, | give my humble opinion that 
E. C. F. G. should inspect all parishes in the entire 
principality, and where it is found that the people want to 
have Protestant preachers, and the parishes' property 
would not be sufficient to maintain them, that then by 
order of E. C. F. G. the same congregation, be it from the 
town hall or otherwise, must provide so much annually. 
For if they want to have a parish priest, it is the office of 
the C.C.F.G. to keep them so that they also reward the 
worker, as the Gospel states (Matth. 10,10. Luc. 10, 7.). 

Such a survey could be done in such a way that 
C.F.G. divides the principality into four or five parts and 
sends two nobles or officials to each part to investigate 
such estates and parishes and to find out what is 
necessary for the parish priest, and to request such an 
order from C.F.G. regarding the annual tax. If, however, 
such costs or efforts would be too much for C.C.F.G., 
citizens from the cities could be needed for this purpose, 
or the countryside could demand that a number of 
prominent cities do so and act with them. But whichever 
pleases E. C. F. G. best, let it be so. 

In addition, attention should be paid to the old priests 
or otherwise unfit ones, so that, where they are otherwise 
devout, or not contrary to the Gospel, they either read the 
Evangelia with the Postillia itself (where

(Regest.) 


On Dec. 2, Schwenkfeld had a discussion with Luther and 
Bugenhagen about the Lord's Supper and on the same day, with 
this letter as an accompanying letter, he sent a letter from 
Krantwald about the Lord's Supper, which he asks to be 
considered. In this letter he says: "It is impossible that the Pabst's 
kingdom should perish as long as this article of flesh and blood 
stands in the sacrament of bread and wine." - Luther did not reply 
to both Schwenkfeld and Krautwald until April 14, 1526.

also full of the Lord! As unpleasant as your marriage is to 
your brothers, the servants of Baal, 1) it is pleasant to me, 
indeed God has shown me nothing more pleasant in you 
(apart from the gospel) than that | should be worthy to 
see and hear you as a husband. But this too shall be 
considered as no small gift and fruit of the Gospel. But 
with what kind of heart | remained absent, and for what 
reasons | did not come to this exceedingly pleasant 
wedding of yours, M. Eberhard will tell. Thus everything 
turns around under the prince, who is a confessor of the 
Gospel and even chivalrous (equestris). We are less 
safe on the journey than under the prince who looked 
through his fingers and did nothing, and now mall is 
forced to fear those as servants of highwaymen and 
traitors who should be expected to be castles of refuge. 
But this in relation to those. | return to you wishing you 
great joy and many children, through Christ's blessing. 
Surely, my heart leaps in my body at your wedding, that, 
| want you to believe, not unlike my own. But I, poor man, 
would have sent you the golden Portugaleser 2) which 
you had given to mine, if | had not feared that you might 
take offense at it. Therefore, | am sending one that | still 
have left over from the wedding, and | do not know 
whether it was yours or not. But you will recognize by this 
small gift my exceedingly great affection for you. But what 
are words necessary? | am convinced that | am too well 
known to you to need my confession. Greet your wife in 
the most loving way, but you should do this when you 
hold Catharina in the marriage bed under the most loving 
embraces and kisses and think: "Behold, this person, the 
very good dear creature of my God, has been given to 
me by my Christ; to him be praise and honor. |, too, since 
| can guess the day on which you will have received this 
letter, will in the night, with the same work, send the letter 
to you.

To Spalatin. 

The chapter of the Altenburg Abbey had warned Spalatin in 
writing to desist from his supposed marriage and threatened him 
with the loss of his canonry for breaking the celibacy. For this 
reason, Spalatin turned to the Rector and the University of 
Wittenberg, and they instructed Luther to write to Spalatin, 
asking him what he should reply to those of their nobility.

To the highly venerable brother in Christ, Georg 
Spalatin, the faithful servant of God, Bishop of the 
Church at Altenburg. 

Grace and peace! It has been charged to me, who am 
very busy, my dear Spalatin, that | answer you about the 
things you wrote to the Rector and the University. First, 
you may not give way to these proud Baal servants, but 
again despise them bravely, and answer them with lofty 
speech about this way: You, too, have taken marriage 
for this reason, so that you may bear witness before God 
and men, but above all testify to them that you will not 
consent to their wicked, impure, godless and devil- 
worshiping state, or rather to their Sodom, which is 
consecrated to fire and brimstone from heaven and will 
shortly be devoured. Therefore, you still admonish them

you are well assured of your conscience. Also, it may be 
found that the pope himself has allowed and dispensed 
for money and favor, and has set up another law against 
his right, which is not new in himself. And even if the 
pope did not do it, or if it were ever new with us, it is 
enough that it is not new with God. And what Pabst

And because the trouble presses so hard, and they 
make themselves out as if it were unjust, you ought to 
resist it all the more, as you know that St. Paul teaches 
and does where they want to deny him his freedom, and 
continues just then when they press upon him, and looks 
neither at trouble nor at laws. For we must always act 
defiantly and boldly if they want to weaken or deny us

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! In response to E. C. F. G.'s 
letter, | have spoken with the licentiate, for the sake of 
surgery, 1). But it has been decided that nothing will come 
of it this time; not that he cannot do it, or is unskilled in it, 
but that the Faculty of Medicine thinks it should not be 
done, for the reason that [it] is an art that belongs to 
Practica, and should not be done with reading; For it 
includes anatomy and many other things that are not yet 
customary or practiced in our country; and especially if it 
were to be read in German, the balblers would make a 
mockery of it and not listen, because they consider 
themselves ready masters. Should one then buy mockery 
for money and contempt? would not be advice; otherwise 
it is enough. It is true that we would have gladly helped 
him herewith to service and office, as he also did with my; 
lord. H. blessed, Duke Frederick, that H. C. F. G. might 
want to provide him with a service. For he has one of the 
nuns, 2) because of which he is not allowed to go to 
foreign principalities in the presence of the nobility and 
tyrants, and yet he is pious, faithful, learned and well kept 
by our physicians, so that he would be well worthy if H. C. 
F. G. would give him a year or two in pay or man's money, 
until God advised him with a service. And since | did not 
otherwise complain too much to E. C. F. G., | would like 
to humbly request that E. C. F. G. look at his great poverty 
and thirst, in which he is now in his third year, and give 
him one florin or thirty out of the remaining money of this} 
foundation, one year or two only. After all, it is so well 
invested, 


1) We have placed the words "for the sake of surgery" between|

Surgery". In our letter, it must have been about the establishment 
of a chair of surgery in order to provide for Basil. However, nothing} 
came of it, because the medical faculty had declared itself against 
it with the reasons given by it.

does without any of that. Command this all in E. C. F. G.'s

Luther expresses his joy about the state of the church in 
Reutlingen, which has so far remained pure and free of 
fanaticism. He approves of the changes made there in the 
ceremonies and warns him against new changes along the lines 
of the Wittenberg order of worship.

faithful evangelist of the church at Reutlingen, his 
brother in Christ. 

Grace and peace! Your exceedingly dear brothers are 
returning to you, my dear Alber, for God wanted them to 
be so edified by us as they have been pleasant and sweet 
to us, not only by their own faith and godliness, but also 
by the exceedingly sweet message with which they have 
delighted us greatly, telling us that the state of your 
church is still intact and pure from these spiritual 
wickednesses. For seldom do we hear

hometown in 1519, where he introduced the Reformation. 
Zwingli's attempt to draw him to his side by his letter of November 
16, 1524 (St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 1513) failed. In 1536, he met 
Luthern personally during the negotiations on the Wittenberg 
Concord. Expelled from Reutlingen in 1548 by the Interim, Duke 
Ulrich summoned him to Stuttgart. He died on Dec. 2, 1570.

you do not change again according to our example, but

we have reprinted this letter, using the same. - The Bries, written 
by Luther to Schuldorp, probably in Latin, was translated by the 
latter into Low German for his writing, and from there translated 
into High German by others. 


To the honorable and prudent Marquardo Schuldorp 
of Kiel, |, Martinus Luther, wish grace and peace 
in Christ. 

| have heard your writing, my dear Marquard, which 
you sent to me the closest, and | can easily believe, and 
almost certainly know, that many are angry and make a 
big fuss about the fact that you have taken your sister's 
daughter in marriage. And | do not want to help you that 
you did it with my advice and permission, that is, with 
God's advice and permission, which | took from divine 
Scripture. Yes, this is what causes the greatest 
annoyance of all, that you have taken the arch-heretic 
and damned man, the devil's apostle and apostate, 
Luther, as your council and followed him in this. 

You should have given money to the most holy father, 
the pope, and bought and paid such a woman from the 
same womanizer. That would have been right, Christian 
and godly; no trouble would have remained, and you 
would have been honored as a pious child. The villain 
Luther gives justice and takes no money for it: is this not 
a great impudence? how can one suffer it! 

Now, dear Marquard, | confess and admit that it is my 
divine counsel and permission. For there stands our 
foundation and rock: What God does not forbid, but 
leaves free, that shall remain free for everyone, and no 
one is to be obeyed who forbids what God wants to have 
free, but everyone is guilty of doing against such a 
prohibition with words and works, and always to defy it, 
Gal. 2 and 5. 

Now this is evident, no one may say otherwise, except 
that God has not forbidden but left it free for sisters' 
children to marry each other, or for someone to take his 
brother's or sister's daughter. In spite of this, one letter 
here indicates otherwise. Although the pope is not too 
shy to forbear such things when money or favor do the 
intercession, even though he is still such a strict lord. 
However, we hope that God Almighty will ever be so wise 
as to give 


826 


and to govern people as the pope is, and we should be 
more sure to follow God than the pope. But this does not 
help; there is no hearing here. Say, write, sing, or read, 
and they stand like sticks, even like stones. In short, eyes 
and ears closed, with the head through: Heretics, 
heretics, heretics! It is not right, it is not right! like the mad, 
raging dogs or ravening beasts in the forest. 

Well then, because they do not hear badly, and want 
to have such divine freedom increased and dampened by 
force, you should 1) again say and do everything in spite 
of their great power, which only distorts them to the very 
highest and annoys them most bitterly. They are worth 
nothing else than that they see and hear what annoys 
them, because they rage and rage against that which 
should correct them; as it is written: He does not want the 
blessing, so it should come far enough from him. | have 
also taken a nun in marriage, though | might have advised 
it, and had no special cause, but that | had done it in 
defiance of the devil with his scales, the great men, 
princes, and bishops, who wickedly desire that spiritual 
persons should be free. 

And | would like to cause even more trouble, if only |

cannot get there and teach the weak. Therefore they 
must answer for it. Even if it comes to that, that Christian 
and divine liberty wants to be muffled or desecrated, the 
same is more to be taken care of, than the weak; because 
in God's word is more, than in the whole world. 

If they threaten death, Christ has more life than the 
devil has death. If they will take goods, Christ is richer 
than they. If they want to be ungracious lords and nobles, 
let them bind up their grace, so that it does not follow us, 
until Christ's grace is no longer suitable. 

Stand firm, therefore, and do not turn to anger, wrath, 
displeasure, trouble, harm, or danger, because God is 
not against you, but with you. 

First of all, you have the clear text that sister-daughter 
is not forbidden before God. 

Secondly, that even before the pope it is not forbidden 
higher than for the sake of favor and money, and not for 
the sake of God, that whoever keeps it [keeps it] not for 
the sake of God, but for the sake of money. 

Now hold them against each other, God and Pope, 
which is the greatest? which is more to be believed and 
followed? and which has more honest cause for itself? 


knew something more that would please God and annoy|God leaves it free for the sake of His grace and our 
them. For with this | cool my temper at their raging against} conscience. The pope bequeaths it and holds it captive 


the gospel, so that they are angry, and | do not give 
anything to it, and always continue, and do it the more, 
the more they do not want it. They insist on force, so | 
defy the right, and will wait whether force or right will 
finally go and stay. 

So | counsel you to do likewise. You should be sorry 
if they are not angry with you, for that would be a sign tha 
you are living to please the enemies of the gospel. But if 
they are angry, you should laugh and be of good cheer, 
because you know that it pleases God. 

But that some of the weak also take offense at this is 
not our fault, but the fault of the tyrants who resist the 
gospel, so that it is 


1) "Shall you" put by us instead of: "shall they". 


for the sake of money and his tyranny. 

Thirdly, you have the powerful example of Abraham, 
who confessed his Sarah for his right sister, on account 
of his father and not on account of his mother, Gen. 20. 
This must be that [she] was his stepsister, or, as the text 
reads, his brother Haran's daughter. But Abraham is far 
more than all the popes. If he has not gone to the devil 
about it, but has pleased God in such a marriage, then no 
one will stand in danger according to your example. If 
they are angry and blaspheme the work and example of 
the holy archfather Abraham, let them be angry. 

God, whom Abraham pleased and served with it, will 
find them well. Only despise their anger and blasphemy 
as much as they despise and blaspheme your marriage.

Elector John of Saxony to Luther. 


The Elector asks Luther whether he should write again to the 
Libeckers about the imprisoned preacher. - Luther's concern, 
which is no longer present, must have turned out favorably, 
because the Elector wrote again on 20'. January.

Elector. Our greeting before. Venerable and learned one, 
dear devotee! We have read the contents of your letter 
in addition to the reply sent by Libeck to the preacher's 
half, which will be kept in prison with them, and although 
we have heard your concern, why it would not be 
convenient to write further to the preacher's half touched 
by LUbeck, but since you have not read their answer, and 
we, if it is to be done according to the form of the same, 
would not be disinclined to prescribe the poor man once 
again, we have not refrained from sending you a copy of 
the touched answer and to hear your objections to it. For 
even though the Liibeckers justify their action by Imperial 
mandate 2), we have not failed to send you a copy of our 
reply. Maj. mandate 2), they nevertheless continue to 
charge the preacher with it, and also indicate how they 
would have had to secretly imprison him for it, so that 
they now do not know how to release him for obvious 
reasons. Therefore, our gracious request is that you see 
the letter from LUbeck, and then let us know your concern 
as to whether or not he should further be [prescribed] 3) 
and what should be written about. For we will note your 
misgivings, which we will therefore duly abide by and 
show ourselves to, and in your gracious opinion have not 
wished to restrain you from doing so. Date Torgau,

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear

what royal dignity of Denmark, our dear lord and 
uncle, had sought from you by writing and advertising. 
Dignity of Denmark, our dear lord and uncle, had 
sought from you by writing and advertising, which 
their royal search and advertising basically extends to 
the fact that their royal dignity is not to be found in 
Denmark. W.'s search and advertising basically 
extends to the fact that her royal dignity is considering 
to make a choice from some of the things you have 
written. We have heard all the contents that her Royal 
Highness of the place may have her fair entertainment 


help, so that S. K. M. may be preserved here with little) through us. When then the said royal. W., as our lord 


need, until God sends it otherwise. Now | am of the hope 
that it should not be necessary for me to stop, because it 
is before our eyes the great miraculous work of Christ, 
which He has done in this man and has so changed and 
converted him that we may recognize nothing else in him, 
but Christ Himself as our guest, and who knows for what 
purpose God sends this, that He pushes such a great 
prince into misery and gives us into the fold. But | know 
what may be said here, of which | would perhaps, when | 
come to Torgau, like to tell E. C. F. G. by oral speech 
through those who are to present it, only that E. C. F. G. 
will not refuse the wretched man a gracious answer or

and grandfather, is inclined to show me friendly 
courtesy in this matter, but since it is not known to you 
in any doubt what form your royal family took before, 
during the life of our dear brother, Duke Frederick, of 
blessed and praiseworthy memory, when your royal 
family had its being in Wittenberg for some time,°) was 
impetuously approached by its creditors for payment, 
as well as at that time your royal family had its being 
in Wittenberg for some time, it is not known to you in 
any doubt what form your royal family took before, 
during the life of our dear brother, Duke Frederick, of 
blessed and praiseworthy memory. Therefore, we 
fear that if her K. W. would again settle in Wittenberg 
and be in our country, the same search would be left 
behind by her creditors as little as before, and it would 
probably result in a burdensome access and injustice 
for us, also for our lands and people. From all this, as 
you have to realize, it will be difficult and painful for us 


to maintain our lord and uncle, the king, in this place.

Elector John of Saxony to Luther. 


The Elector demands from Luther and his colleagues an 
objection to the marriage case of the pastor of Allstadt, Jodocus 
Kern. 


The original concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. O, p. 
528. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 100 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 
308. 


Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! Between the priest of Allstadt 1) and his wife, 
there have been misunderstandings and discord due 
to their marital relationship, for which reason we have 
ordered our castle to interrogate him on the same 
matter. He has now sent us a record of the 
proceedings he has had and what each party has 
brought forward, which we are sending to you in 
safekeeping together with a document that the said 
priest at Allstadt has now sent to us. And since this 
transaction must be proven and acted upon by divine 
Scripture, and thus well worthy of good consideration, 
it is our gracious request that you, along with other 
scribes, diligently survey and move what will be 
necessary to report to the pastor and his wife, and 
send us the same of your and the others’ concerns, 
which you will draw to this end, along with the 
enclosed writings, so that we may continue to give our 
minds to our treasurer at Allstadt. 


1) In Nuremberg in 1524, Jodocus Kern had married Ursula 
Tepler *), a nun who had left the Engelthal monastery, but who 
did not accompany him to Saxony, but wanted to follow him when 
he found a place to live. When he was gone, however, letters from 
her former prioress aroused her conscience, so that she only 
followed her husband at the urging of her relatives when he 
became Miunzer's successor in Allstadt. The relatives advised 
him to keep her firm so that she would not disgrace the word of 
God. Kern seems to have followed this advice, because he forced 
her to eat meat on Char Friday 2c. Finally she escaped to 
Mansfeld. After several futile attempts to persuade her to return, 
the Schésser at Allstadt received orders to interrogate her, and 
both spouses had given him their answers on January 11. She 
did not listen to the admonition to return to her husband.

E. C. F. G. have written for a preacher, because the 
present one is not competent to preach the Gospel. Since 
the parish is in fief to the Abbot of Doberlech*) and he 
himself is also inclined to appoint this Baltzer Ritter, letter- 
writer from the same monastery, who is willing to leave 
the monastery for such a reason, | think it would be a 
good idea not to refuse, but rather to appoint a new 
preacher. 


2) "of them" is a conjecture of the Erl. Exchange of Letters. 
Burkhardt: "darinen". 

3) Burkhardt has the following note on this: "The pastor Kéler 
and the castle of Liebenwerda had examined the pastors of 
Wahreubrtick and Friedersdorf, and found the former unfit, since 
he was very unclear in his sermons and did not want to administer 
the sacrament under either form, because, as he claimed, it had 
not been 'recognized' so far. The examiners, however, did not 
enforce Luther's will; the congregation had already accepted 
Jakob Kriiger as a clergyman before the purchase of the Elector's 
order." - That "Wartinbrug" and "Wartinburg" in the text are not to 
be understood as "Wartenburg", which is only one and a half 
German miles away from Wittenberg, is shown not only by the 
feudal affiliation of the parish to the monastery of Dobrilugk, but 
also by the choice of the examiners from Liebenwerda.

Cistercian monastery.

overlooked all the correspondence sent to E. C. F. G. 
concerning the pastor of Allstadt and his wife. And 
because E. C. F. G. desires our concern in this matter, 
we consider it best to have the woman brought to her 
friends in Nuremberg and there to try her for a while to 
see if the devil will give way to God's good admonition, 
since it is to be feared that she will remain with the people 
where she is now, and does not allow herself to be 
spoken or written about in any way, because there she 
has ears, eyes and all senses and hearts full of 
contradiction without interruption, and in addition is a 
woman who, through the natural nature of female 
weakness, also has the temptation of both the devil and 
men against her, so that great wonder and joy are the 
result. 


1) Burkhardt: "kome". 


‘That should be there, that it should stand, and probably a 
strong man of spirit would waver in such a case. But if 
they cannot persuade their friends, what can be done? 
So let them go and live according to their will, and then 
let the priest be free, as if she had died, to do as he 
pleases. Whether or not the loose spirit causes a great 
deal of trouble through this deal, one has to command 
God, who will probably make something good out of it.

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! In response to E. C. F. G.'s 
letter concerning the ceremonies of the convent at 
Altenburg, | humbly express my concern. First of all, | am 
pleased with the way the preachers in Altenburg have 
expressed their concerns. However, to strengthen E. C. 
F. G.'s conscience in the matter and to attack the idolater 
more gently, | hereby offer this addition to E. C. F. G.: 
namely, that E. C. F. G. lets himself be heard that E. C. 
F. G.'s conscience hardly wanted to be, and that E. C. F. 
G.'s conscience should not be, and that E. C. F. G.'s 
conscience should not be. conscience would hardly want 
to be, and quite unfit before God, to allow such their 
being any longer; as it is then also all the more true; for 
which reason | graciously suggest that they either 
abstain completely, or if not, that they keep their doings 
secretly without annoyance. 

Such conscience have E. C. F. G. two reasons. The 
first, because the C.F.G. is certainly informed by God's 
Word that such blasphemous worship is unlawful and 
condemnable, and yet, as a secular authority, must 
protect it, and, having hitherto been provided with 
interest and goods, must manage it, would finally be in 
front of

God will also bring all her abominations home to E. C. F. 
G.'s conscience and weigh them down, as he will provide 
money, goods, protection and all works of approval for 
such abominations. And if such an abomination could or 
would go without C.C.F.G. protection and preservation, it 
would be excused and would have to let it go; but since 
it cannot remain without C.C.F.G. protection and 
preservation of the place, C.C.F.G. conscience would 
always have to be involved and guilty, as it could prevent 
it, and does not. The other reason is that a secular ruler 
is not to tolerate that his subjects are led into disunity and 
discord by obnoxious preachers, from which there would 
ultimately be a fear of riot and disorder, but in one place 
there should also be the same preaching. For this 
reason, the Nuremberg monks have stopped their monks 
and closed the monasteries. 

But whether they will plead their consciences, that 
shall not help them; for they are first required to prove 
their consciences and presumptions with the Scriptures, 
or to be instructed. For this reason they have refused, 
and have publicly declared that they do not wish to 
engage in scriptural disputation, but will remain in their 
established custom, as proven by the Christian church. 
Thus they give sufficient testimony against themselves 
that they fabricate such consciences and only pretend to 
do so. For a right conscience does and desires nothing 
better than that it may hear the teaching of the Scriptures 
and dispute its matters with the Scriptures. But they 
willfully despise the Scriptures; therefore it would be right 
for them to be silenced or not to suffer, for the same 
reason, as those who have nothing good in mind, 
because they shun the light and will not wait for the 
Scriptures. 

But for more glimpses, E. C. F. G. may offer them 
once again, yes, even demand with seriousness, that 
they try themselves with the preachers at Altenburg in the 
Scriptures, and act with Scripture against Scripture. If 
they can stand with the Scriptures, then so be it; if not, 
then, according to the Nuremberg example, they are 
freshly commanded to be silent and to refrain, and thus 
the same sermon and manner will be carried out at 
Altenburg. 

But lest they say that mau forces them to believe, that 
is not the opinion; son

They are only left with the public annoyance that they 
themselves cannot maintain, and must confess that it is 
not founded in Scripture, and yet they want to keep it, 
wantonly to ruin other souls and to harm country and 
people, also to shame and ridicule God and His Gospel. 
They let them be content that they are left with body and 
soul, with protection and honor in the country, and that 
they may worship and serve in their chambers whom they 
want and as many gods as they want; publicly, they 
should not blaspheme the right God and deceive the

the regulations of the university to give M. Philippsen 200 
fl. per year. Now the man complains about taking this, for 
the reason that, because he is not able to read the 
Scriptures so rigidly and daily, he would not like to take it 
with a good conscience, and thinks that E. C. F. G. 
demands such strict reading from him, so my saying and 
interpreting does not help him at all: for this reason, my 
humble request is that E. C. F. G. would purify and 
interpret her mind toward him herself, rather than that she 
be satisfied that he is reading the theology. 





He should help him with the disputation and reading, as 
was done before, but as much as he can, even if itis only 
once a week, or as much as he can. For even if E. C. F. 
G. gave him such pay for a year or two, he would be well 
worth it, since he had previously read the Scriptures for 
two years without pay, with great labor and fruit, and 
perhaps also partly spoiled himself with it. | would like to 
bring the Scriptures back here in the Schwang, because

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! We have heard your letter and concerns 
about what is to be reported to the Chapter at 
Altenburg concerning the ceremonies, singing and the 
reading of the Mass, and have graciously noted this 
from you; accordingly, God willing, we want to 
continue to show’ ourselves’ Christian and 
unquestioning in these matters. When you also wrote 
to us on a note on behalf of Philip Melanchthon, we 
read it out, and our minds were not, as they are not, 
that Philip should be bound to read daily against the 
pay in the Scriptures, as he perhaps thinks, for we 
have ordered him the same pay more out of grace 
than that we should bind him to the work that is 
somewhat infallible to him on account of his body, as 
we also write to him in this regard. 2) We do not want 
to restrain you in your gracious opinion, because we 
are inclined to be gracious to you. Date Torgau, on 
Tuesday after Estomihi [February 13] Anno Domini

To Johann Agricola, the extremely faithful educator of 
the youth in Eisleben, the servant of Christ, his 
extremely dear [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Again, | have nothing to 
write, my dear Agricola, but | write to greet you and your 
wife, because what you asked for in your last letter, | 
believe, has become known to you in the meantime, 
namely that of the Strasbourg heretics; God convert 
them. For against Oecolampad and Zwingli, excellent 
things have been written by the very learned men of 
Swabia 3) (this book is published here anew), moreover, 
Billicanus has also written briefly (whose book | send 
here), but those have written extensively and learnedly. 
| hope that theirs will finally be hopeless, which they have 
so confidently praised so far. This one heresy now has 
five sects,” all of which have the same opinion, but with 
different grounds of proof; therefore they will soon perish. 

That royal woman and in truth a queen, Elizabeth, the 
wife of the king of the Danes, departed from life, as the 
king himself wrote to me, but she departed in a great 
faith, having received the Lord's Supper according to the 
right custom of Christ, and could not be persuaded, 
though she was strongly challenged by the great ones, 
that she should return to the faith of the pope,

complaining about the Barefoot, as E. C. F. G. will hear 
from their petition. Now it is only right that others should 
enjoy the monastery, as some already have good parts 
of it, so that they are not pushed into misery in their old 
age, which would bring E. C. F. G. great displeasure and 
calumny along with all of us and the Gospel. | know very 
well that E. C. F. G.'s mind is not like that, but the poor 
people cannot be cared for like that,’ so they are not 
cared for like it would be Christian and fair that E. C. F. 
G. would be reported sufficiently. Please, therefore, let E. 
C. F. G. order the poor people from the monastery 
property to be provided for as long as it lasts; who knows 
how long they will live? And perhaps among them there 
might be one who would be the judge of us all on the last

Grace and peace in the Lord! There was no 
opportunity, my dear Amsdorf, to help this poor Johann 
Honhof to a position. For there are many here, so that if 
one could measure according to the number of the 
Scriptures, one could turn the gospel around and say 
[Matth. 9, 37.]: There are many workers, but the harvest 
is small. But the miserable and needy belly makes such 
people much, in the spirit nevertheless remain few 
workers. Yesterday we baptized a son to Carlstadt, or 
rather we rebaptized the baptism. 3) Godparents are 
Jonas, Philippus, my Kathe; | have been a guest with 
others in a hurry. This happened in Segren on the other

have thought in the previous year that it could happen 
that those who called baptism a dog's bath should now 
ask for it even from their enemies! Whether 4) they desire 
this from the heart or sincerely must be left to God, but 
these are great miracles when one sees how the works

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | humbly inform E. C. F. G. 
that the good, poor man, Christophel Mocha, of Segrehn, 
has recently been noticeably damaged by E. C. F. G.'s 
order. The fault lies with the commanders, who neglected 
to let the good man come neither to interrogation nor to 
evidence, but let the day of assistance go by postponing 
the inspection of the mill. Now he has good churfirstl. 
Now he has a good fief over the same mill, which | have 
seen and want to prove with the whole village that he is 
being wronged; therefore my humble request is for him, 
as he has asked me, because he is a poor man, has 
many children and little, that E. C. F. G. wants to help 
others. F. G. want to give orders to others, who could 
wait for it and would be suitable, as the captain of 
Heimchen and possibly a nobleman, that they inspect 
and recognize it, so that the good man does not suffer 
such damage and violence to further ruin. E. C. F. G. has 
also promised to build him several logs of wood, but it 
has not been done, and it will be delayed until the 
locksmith does not want to know anything about it. 


E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously comply with this.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! We have received your letter, in which you 
inform us that the foreign printers are to the detriment 
of those in Wittenberg, and that they should print your 
books with such carelessness that you yourselves do 
not know them, with further content and your request. 
Now we would be inclined to grant your request by 
sending out notices to several places, also to the 
printers at Wittenberg, in the same way as the Pope, 
Imperial Maj. and Venetian printers. Maj. and the 
Venetians are wont to do to their printers, freedom 
and pardon should be granted. We fear, however, 
that if we were to do so," it would introduce an 
inaccuracy, but we think that it should be so, if 
something special new were to be printed by you in 
Wittenberg, that we would be notified of it beforehand; 
so we are graciously inclined to give the printers a 
special pardon for this, in which a named time is to be 
expressed, that within the same time no one is to 
reprint the same materials (marteri) in our 
princedoms. Similarly, we will gladly encourage 
others outside of our country, so that this may remain 
with their printers as much as possible. If you now 
think that the printers, even you yourselves, are 
sufficient for this, we will graciously respond to your 
further request. In our gracious opinion, we do not 
want to hold you to this. Date Torgau, on the 16th day 
of March, Anno Domini 26.

The; Mr. Johann Agricola, the instructor of the youth

Grace and peace! Lest so many and so great things 
come, so much and so great you fear them, my dear 
Agricola, once again grace and peace. By the way, 
according to our testimony, Wendalin 4) is also worthy of 
being revered, not only cherished and cared for, because} 
of his loyalty. He is

4) Wendalin Faber, recommended here as a teacher of the| 
elementary school in Eisleben and soon accepted, later became! 
the castle preacher of Count Gebhard von Mansfeld in Seeburg 
and as such signed the Schmalkaldic Articles. In the antinomian 
controversy he was Agricola's opponent. He delivered this letter. 


But there, so that, if there is any hope of establishing a 
German school, he may take upon himself the work and 
the burden of teaching the children, as it is said that one 
has heard something from you that such a salary can be 
procured from the grass or from the authorities. You will 
therefore do what you can, and may you not desist from 
assisting the man who, according to my judgment, is holy 
in Christ. So much from him. That little vessel of Zwickau, 
oh how much and how much it has changed from what 
you saw, 5) when you saw it. But of this and the goblet 
given to me by Meinhard 6) another time. For | did not 
want that today and in such a short letter these wonderful 
things are treated. Fare well with Elsa and with her 7)

5) What kind of vessel it might have been, we are not able to 
guess. In No. 972, Hausmann has described it in his inscription 
as a "glass one", for which a wickerwork, as Luther writes, would 
have been sufficient; in the letter to Agricola of May 11, it is called 
a "tin-glass one". But it was so beautiful that Luther's wife had 
taken it so much to her heart that, when Luther wanted to send it 
as a gift to Agricola, she got rid of it with the help of Jonas and 
Bugenhagen. In No. 999 it is called "a glass" (vitrum). 

6) Christoffel Meinhard, a citizen of Eisleben who had formerly 
been a follower of Minzer. 

7) Here we have assumed with the Erl. Briefw. suis instead of 
tuis assumed. 

8) The Archbishop of Mainz, as reported in the Tischreden, 
Cap. 31, ? 2, (St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, 975), the Archbishop of 
Main had sent 20 gold florins to Luther's wife through a doctor in 
1525. Kolde, "Martin Luther", vol. Il, p. 205 refers our letter to it 
and the Erl. Briefw. assumes this. But this seems very doubtful to 
us, not only because of the year 1525 (which might be wrong), 
but mainly because of what Luther says here about the 
"Firmelung" and the "firmelen", which can hardly go to the 
Cardinal of Mainz.

| could not do otherwise, you would have taken it away 
again, as | asked. But since the man causes such trouble 
through the confirmation, | was willing to send it all back 
to you, and | have not yet decided to keep it. For | should 
be guilty of other people's sins if | took it from him who so 
publicly mocks Christian doctrine. And | tell you that | am 
moved by such a thing, and that | almost leave the Psalter 
and Psalms behind. But it was not necessary to "confirm", 
it would have been done by someone else. Dear Lord, let 
us not grumble here. If we are serious about God's word, 
then it does not suffer from jiggery-pokery. The psalms 
are not yet finished, for | have too much to do. It is not 
speaking and doing one thing. Your Psalterlin shall 
become yours. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, am 20. April 1526.

To My Most Gracious Lord, Duke Johann, Elector of 
Saxony 2c. For the attention of S. C. F. G. 
Handen. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Herewith | send E. C. F. G. 
the booklet of the Council, as much as it is printed; 1) 
because on E. C. F. G's letter the other one has 
remained in the pen and has been kept as E. C. F. G. 
requested. 

To Erasmus' writing it seems good to us that E. C. F. 
G. does not let himself get involved in the matter, as the 
Vipera seeks, but answers in such a way: as he himself 
well knows that E. C. F. G. may not nor should be judge 
in the spiritual matter; therefore he should have spared 
E. C. F. G. such a request 2c. But E. C. F. G. wants to 
add: that, even if it were a secular matter, he would still 
have repaid Luther with a writing that went out into all the 
world, as he knows that a greater judge belongs to it than 
a prince, nor is the right way to punish someone by 
someone's writing or complaint alone, but court, 
complaint and answer should be made as is due, 2c., 
which is stated in E. C. F. G.'s letter. C. F. G. favor. Hiemit

To Vincentius Obsopéus, schoolman in Ansbach. 


Preface to the prophet Jonah. He praises Obsopoeus' 
translations and exonerates Secerius from an accusation. 


First printed in a single edition of the interpretation of the 
prophet Jonah published by Joh. Secerius in Hagenau in 1526, 
the title of which we have included in the 14th volume of our 
edition, Col. 836. Further in Seidemann-De Wette, vol. VI, p. 77 
and in the Erlangen edition, Opera latina varii argumenti, tom. VII, 
p. 504. 

Martin Luther au his [friend] in the Lord, Vincentius 
Obsopoeus. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! That among other things 

which are of thee, thou shalt also 


1) not only "the first printed sheet", as the Erl. Briefw., Vol. V, 
p. 344 states. 


856 


You have translated the prophet Jonah, which | have 
treated in a German interpretation, into Latin, my dearest 
Vincentius, that is very pleasant to me, so much is 
missing in it that it should be annoying to me, which you 
have sometimes suspected. Those people are certainly 
annoying to me who not only translate what is 
contemptible, but also all the good things of others in 
such a way that they completely reverse them, since they 
are ignorant of languages and _ extraordinarily 
industrious, not to mention how much they not 
infrequently err in meaning, so much so that they express 
negatively what is affirmative, and vice versa. But | see 
that you, along with few others, have been given this not 
insignificant gift, that you translate my German writings 
purely, actually and carefully into Latin. Therefore | am 
glad that my Jonah speaks through you in Latin. Not as 
if the honor tickled me that this work should be spread 
out in a foreign language, which | would hope in vain in 
this time, which so despises poor Luther by all and 
everywhere, that | could dare to sing or rather lament 
with Christo in truth thus [Ps. 22, 7.]: "| am a worm and 
no man, a mockery of the people and contempt of the 
people.” But, what | rejoice in with a clear conscience, is 
this, that godly and pious readers will read nothing evil, 
nothing heretical, nothing seditious in my Jonah, but 
godly, healthy and wholesome things, while meanwhile 
those restless and forward spirits with insolent 
blasphemies put the whole world in confusion and draw 
even the godly and calm minds into their monstrosities. 
For this is the mischievousness of Satan, that, if he 
cannot destroy all, yet he gives trouble to all with ungodly 
doctrines, and afflicts all, so that they do not apply 
themselves purely and freely to the pure doctrines of 
Christ alone. In this respect, | wish you happiness for the 
second time, who in such great turmoil of the angry 
prophets do not give way, nor are you annoyed by my 
inability, but simply choose what is pure and well- 
founded, in which you work with us, even 1) with Christ, 
for the spread of the knowledge of salvation.

That is, of the faith that clings to Him. Hail, brother! 
Continue as you have begun, and the Lord will multiply 
and sustain you. But it pleases me that you give the 
booklet to Johann Secerius at Hagenau to print, because 
this man is worthy of much greater service, and above 
all a faithful and careful printer. For the fact that he is 
disgraced by certain people, as if he were Secerius, 
whom | accused of theft in the preface to a certain postilla 
2), | believe has happened either through ignorance, or 
because they have been deceived by the ambiguous 
name, or through the malice of men, who under this 
pretext wish to harass the man in an undeserved 
manner, as Satan is everywhere wont to do nothing but 
harm. For in the same preface | testify clearly enough 
that in Wittenberg there was that "typesetter" 
(secerium) in our print shop who is called locator, who 
stole an incomplete copy without my knowledge. 
Therefore, by this my testimony, | want to have excused 
my Secerius, the printer of my Latin Jonah, to all pious 
people, so that he will not be burdened by fate or rather 
by the misfortune of the same name. | wanted to add this 
to this letter out of a sense of duty. But you, my dear 
Vincentius, are quite well in Christ. Wittenberg, on the 
twenty-fifth of April, Anno 1526.

His brother in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus Gerbel, the servant 

of the Lord at Strasbourg. 

God be praised and thanked that Christ has at least 
preserved you with some others, among whom to my joy 
is also my Lonicer, from those who hate to be called 
"heavy spirits" while they continue to be so. And that 
Oekolampad is seized by this plague before all is a great 
pain to me, because God has made this man skillful in 
handling our affairs, both by knowledge of languages and 
by his reputation in more than one respect; God convert 
him by His 1) grace. By the way, what you desire, that | 
should write against them and treat the Lord's Supper, 
that is also my highest desire, but so far neither my time 
nor my strength has permitted this. Christ will help in due 
time; in the meantime, it is good that they should be fully 
revealed and brought out into the open. It is easy for the 
truth, namely Christ, to triumph, even though he must be 
crucified for a little while and not be seen. | give thanks to 
my Christ, who not only strengthened me in the right 
opinion, but also did not let those spirits disgrace his own 
with anything but a sham, and a weak one at that, and 
left a great opportunity for a triumph. Farewell and greet 
your rib, and invite it to be my godmother on Pentecost, 
if it should be a girl; but if it should be a boy, then you 
shall be my godfather, if God is gracious to me and has 
thought me worthy of it. Greet my Lonicer. My necklace 
greets you. Farewell. Wittenberg, Thursday after Jubilate

named D. Amandus, appointed through the dealings of 
evil people, and has suffered much unhappiness. Now

my dear Frederick, | did not want to be guilty of him 
coming empty, at least without a written greeting. For if 
you are well and the Word of God is prospering, | cannot 
hear anything more pleasant; we are well, as much as 
the Lord gives. But | commend myself to your prayers, 
that Christ may not forsake me in temptation. By the way, 
you see how Satan is raging against the Catholic princes; 
the godless bishops are conspiring (as they say), and 
that even war is threatened, Philip writes me, is the truth. 
') Therefore, you will see to it that the people are exhorted 
to fight valiantly in the faith and to pray to the Lord, that 
they may be overcome and restrained by the Spirit, and 
that they may be compelled to keep peace in the flesh. 
At least | recognize from the writings and sayings of many 
that it is highly necessary, the highest necessity, to pray 
earnestly, because Satan is thinking of attacks. 
Therefore, | ask you to impress this matter upon the 
people as a serious and necessary one, since they are 
placed in the midst of Satan's swords and rages, and are 
in danger. The Lord be with you with his grace and with 
his power. Amen. Altenburg, 1526. Martin Luther.

extremely faithful bishop of the people of 
Altenburg. 


Grace and peace! | am sending this Laurentius Fabri, 
my dear Spalatin, as you asked and the prince wrote to 
me at your request that | should send him to you. We 
consider him suitable, you can therefore safely send him 
to the Cronswitz*) nuns, or if any other standing 
(auctoritatis) is required, you can easily bring it about. 


July 15, 1528 Melanchthon writes to Camerarius: "I want you to 
know that in these days the verdict against Hans Schott has been 
passed that he should send his wife back to the citizen of Torgau.

the Erlangen Briefw. place the letter in the beginning of May, - 
instead of "Haffener" is to be read "Hufener". - Should the 
settlement of this matter, as can be assumed from the last note 
to the previous letter, really have taken place only in 1528?

richest and most prestigious in the Voigtland. The convent was

Grace and peace! | am sending you this little pewter- 
glass vessel before it gets another master. For my Kathe 
was also very much inferior to him. | like your judgment 
of Erasmus, but | like even more the progress of your 
boys' school, that one may at least hear a good word in 
the great turmoil of this time. Wendalin is absent, but he 
will hurry to you full of hall; so we have written and sent 
him your letter. You will help the man as he is worthy, and 
you know [how to help]. You shall tell your Elsa, if she 
does not know it yet, that D. Draco has become a 
husband, and it is said that, in the hope of that, Syrus has 
followed here. Fare well with all yours, and pray for me.

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, 
gracious lord! This He Wigand, Briefszeiger, has given up 
the parish of Waltershausen to the town council, 
according to a contract that E. F. G. himself has drawn 
up, so that they are to give him 30 fl. annually from the 
parish goods. Now it is impossible that he will not get 
such money, because perhaps the council does not have 
the parish, as E. F. G. will hear further report, that the 
poor old man must run for his food. Because he has been 
my schoolmaster, and | would be obliged to do him all 
honor, | humbly request that E. F. G. not let my 
schoolmaster forfeit such obligatory money, but 
graciously help him so that he does not have to go 
begging in his old age. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen.

you. Therefore, if thou wilt suffer it, | beseech thee that 
thou mayest teach that which is most important (seria)

these have not taken root, of what use is it that we labor

is accomplished, but that we tickle the unstable minds of 
the exceedingly foolish great multitude, which is frivolous 
and fussy, to no fruit, not to say to the detriment of the

Glory to God and the Word. Well then, arrange it with

No. 1000. 
Strasbourg. June 5, 1526. 
Nicolaus Gerbel to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


He reports that after the disputation in Baden, almost all 
Strasbourg adhered to the Sacramentarians, with the exception 
of some Hedio. Because Zurich, Basel and Strasbourg had 
adopted the same opinion, orthodox writings either did not reach 
them or were suppressed for a long time by the Strasburgers. 
Much could have been prevented by immediate publication of 
Luther's letter to the Strasburgers (No. 925 and 926). The discord 
over the Lord's Supper harmed the progress of the Gospel much 
more than the peasant revolt had harmed it. He, Gerbel, had to 
suffer both from papists and evangelicals, but wanted to remain 
firm. Luther should let Erasmus go, and treat the matter of the 
Sacrament with the firmest possible proofs, reasons and 
scriptural passages. Therefore, he sends several arguments on 
which Oecolampad relies the most, and with which he had 
cornered Eck the most at the disputation in Baden. Finally, about 
his conjugal life: he had lost a beautiful hope because of the 
miscarriage of his wife.

received a son, Johannes Lutherlein, from a very good 
wife and a very lovely woman through God's blessing, 
and have become a father through God's wonderful 
grace. | grant you the same and beg for it, also with a 
happier and greater blessing, since you are better and 
higher than | am. ') But pray that Christ may preserve the 
child for me against Satan, who, as | know, will not refrain 
from hurting me in the Son if God allows him to do so. 
For even now the child is somewhat afflicted, | do not 
know by what small illnesses, or rather (as one thinks) 
by the indigestibility of the unaccustomed milk, with 
which the child-bedewomen are first forced to nourish. 

| am sorry that M. Eberhard's joy has been snatched 
away from him, but God's will is good, but in a very 
hidden kindness, so that one cannot feel anything more 
painful. By the way, when will you come to see us, to see 
the old memories of our familiar intercourse and 
friendship? | have planted the garden, | have built a well, 
both quite happily. Come, and you will be crowned with 
lilies and roses. Be well in the Lord and pray for me. On

To the Elector John of Saxony. 
Intercession for several people. 


See No. 976. In the Leipzig and Walch editions, op. cit., this 
Supplication is considered an appendix to Letter No. 976, which 
is incorrect. This supplement has its own cover. (De Wette, Vol. 
Ill, p. 101.) 

To the most illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Lord 
John, Duke of Saxony and Elector, and Landgrave 
in Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most 
gracious lord. 

First of all, here is a supplement of one, named Jakob 
Holzwart, formerly a choir pupil, whom E. C. F. G. kept 
for a year, with a promise that, where it was invested, E. 
C. F. G. would do a better job of taxation, as the 
supplement shows, and it seems to me that the 
journeyman is skilful; but E. C. F. G. has placed all this 
in his gracious will. 

On the other hand, a nun named Elfe Gaudelitz, 4) 
from the Nymph Monastery near Grym, was asked to get 
something back from the monastery, after she had 
turned a lot into it; but the answer did not come. 

Thirdly, God has sent us two Gardians from France, 
who have also been robbed and are coming here for the 
sake of God's word, and the priest and | are feeding them 
on the goodness and help of E. C. F. G.; if E. C. F. G. 
wants to give them something for the sake of God, it 
would be good if we could not. C. F. G. wants to give 
them something for God's sake, a guilder or six, would 
be good, if not, we have to get rid of them and give what 
we can, and yet beg E. C. F. G. again the next time. God 
gives us many poor people, and we ourselves are also 
poor, but still unspoiled. 

Fourthly, a pious man, Bastian Ligarius, has been 
sent to Arnstadt as a preacher after St. Peter's Day with 
a supplement, which | intend to send to E. C. F. G., 
according to E. C. F. G.'s written request. 


3) This letter arrived in Torgau on June 21, as we can see 
from the next letter. 

4) She received 40 fl. on June 22, 1526 and later on Dec. 18, 
1528 another 30 fl. Between June 1526 and Jan. 1529 she had 
married a citizen of Grimma, Bastian Gulmann.

For, God willing, | will provide the two cities of Arnstadt 
and Gern with two preachers, so that it shall please E. C. 
F. G.. This has now lain here for three years; what | have 
been able to do, | have helped; for what | do, | do out of 
E. C. F. G.'s gift, because | have nothing else. If C.C.F.G. 
also wanted to give him a donation for God's sake; he is 
pious, learned and skilled, but bare and poor, | am not 
able to do as much as is necessary. Put that also in E. C. 
F. G. mild kindness. 

Finally, most gracious Lord, | ask for myself, as 
before, that E. C. F. G. would not let the cantor's office 
dissolve like this, especially because the present 
personnel have grown up on it, and should also be worth 
the art, full of princes and lords to maintain, and yet 
probably more than so many other things, where perhaps 
not so well need be turned, they could well be in 
Wittenberg. In such and such persons, the monasteries’ 
goods would be useful, and God would be pleased with 
them. 

Let that be enough at once, E. C. F. G. graciously give 
me credit for this.

p. 362. 


By the Grace of God John, Duke of Saxony and 
Elector. Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, 
dear devotee! Yesterday, among other things, we 
received a list from you, in which you were requested| 
by some to interdict the sirder against us 2c. We have 
heard this from all sides, and as far as Jakoben 
Holzwart is concerned, who has come to you with a 
Latin letter that we wanted to give him another twenty 
florins for a year over the previous grace shown 2c., 
you know for a fact that we are daily burdened with 
such issues at Wittenberg and elsewhere; we want to 
make sure that the same student will make do with the 
previous grace we have shown him, and now provide 
for himself for his own good. 








For the sake of the nun. Elfe Gaudlitz, who was in 
the monastery at Nimpschen (Nymptzshken), we are 
sending you an order to the superintendents or [the] 
administrator of the same monastery, who is to get 
along amicably with the same nun, where she brought 
something into the monastery, so that she will be 
satisfied. 

When you asked for two gardians sent to you from 
France, who are said to have been robbed on the way, 
we hereby send you six guilders, which you will deliver 
to them. 

The two preachers you have appointed for us, one 
to Arnstadt and the other to Gera, will be sent to 
Weimar in accordance with our letter. What they now 
consume on the way and are still in need of, shall be 
given back to them on their arrival, and thus be 
dispatched according to need. 

For the sake of the choir, Ern Conrad, 1) the 
bandmaster, reports to us that it is almost badly tuned 
and equipped with the present journeymen and boys, 
as we hear such things ourselves every day in 
singing. So we have given Ern Conrad his final 
farewell at his humble request and let him be satisfied. 
Since Conrat Fridrich 2) will no longer be with the 
choir, it cannot be considered our concern that it be 
kept in good order and government, to the extent that 
the journeymen, and in some cases also the boys, are 
badly tuned; We also take care that with the food they 
have had to receive so far, something better can be 
done after all circumstances, and that God is also 
pleased with the world; because if we are not all here, 
the same journeymen go the more part idle and spend 
their time thus in laziness and without benefit. But we 
want to show ourselves well in all this, as we will find 
it best and most convenient. All of this we would not 
want to conceal from you, for we are graciously 
inclined to you. Date Torgau, Friday after Viti [June

Nicolaus Gerbel to Luther. 


Gerbet reports what an evil influence the disputation at Baden 
had had on the Strasbourg people, and urges Luther to write to 
the "Bedeuteter" (significatistas). 


Handwritten at Strasbourg in Thes. Printed by Kolde, p. 
82, and in Erl. 
Briefw., vol.V, p.367. 


Hail in Christ! Our preachers still insist on their 
Opinion, with the exception of Hedio, who stays away 
from this disputation as much as he can, and handles 
this doctrine so cleverly that it is not easy to know 
which of the two opinions he subscribes to. The 
others have become even more stubborn after the 
disputation at Baden, of which the rumor has 
undoubtedly reached you, because in no other piece 
did Oecolampad corner Eck so much as in the 
doctrine of the Lord's Supper. For he demanded of 
Eck that he should prove from Scripture the 
transformation of the bread into the body of Christ. 
Then, even if he proved it as much as he could, 
whether this could be done by the voice of any boy? 
Furthermore, when Oecolampad asked if the body of 
Christ was present in the bread in an invisible way, 
Eck answered that it was there in an invisible way. 
From this, Oecolampad claimed, it follows that Christ 
had two bodies, one at the table, because he lay at it, 
the other in the bread. Since Eck was cornered by 
these and similar reasons, and had nothing to say, 
they moved on to other things. Our people are 
undoubtedly already triumphant, and have turned 
over the greater part of the city, as well as the noblest 
men of the council. | see that the cause of this is that

exercised it in the first year, used it to reintroduce the Papal 
religion. Now the Elector followed him. 





In place of and on account of our most gracious lord's 
gracious request, we kindly request that you endeavor 
to find a learned, skillful and decent preacher and 
assign him to us in the most beneficial manner, and 
we will then promote him according to our lord's order. 
Lord's order, we will then dispatch him to Mihlhausen, 
and decree so much that he shall be provided with

that he shall not lose any diligence in this. In this you

Nicolaus Gerbel to Luther. 


Gerbel sends excerpts from a letter of Capito to Zwingli, which 
Faber has falsified in his translation. He is thinking of leaving his 
position as clerk of the cathedral chapter and seeks Luther's 
advice. 


Handwritten at Strasbourg in Thes. Printed in Kolde's 
Analecta, p. 84 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. V, p. 369. 


Many things are now coming to light which, | have 
no doubt, will be of use to you when you write about 
the Lord's Supper, namely that you can see what 
Satan is up to and what he is up to, how badly he 
conceals, that he does everything he does out of a 
desire for honor, even though he praises | don't know 
what kind of spirit and a leniency unheard of in the

in the past few days,’ which is full of new things, some 
of which | have written out that refer to you, because 
the rest is either foolish or not worthy of being written 
to such a great man. Faber has translated this letter 
into our language, but with such great faithlessness, 
likewise with such great malice. 


2) June 11. Zwinglii opp., tom. VII, p. 515.- The messenger 
was arrested in Wettingen on the Limmat for thoughtless remarks 
about the cult of Mary and brought to Baden, where his letters 
were taken from him, which Joh. Faber, who was present at the 
disputation, seized and immediately translated into German with 
various forgeries and published. In addition, he accused Capito 
both at the Strasbourg Council and at the Speier Imperial Diet of 
highly treacherous activities. Capito not only proved his 
innocence orally before the Strasbourg Council, but also 
countered Faber in two writings that were published in Strasbourg 
on August 12 and 21.

necessary that one could foresee an end of the 
disputation, or: that the turning point of the disputation 
would occur]. This is what Faber said: "Then it would 
be almost necessary that the disputation be reversed, 
The Swiss, where the disputation was held, were very 
unwilling that Capito should desire such shameful 
things. But surely you see how wrongly catastrophe is 
translated in this place. But as the letter is foolish, so it 
has also received an unrhymed and nonsensical 
translator. As for you, this is: "Summa Summarum, the

It would be nice and quite just that your Baalites 5)

commanded them and wants to uphold them. Therefore,

the right; you also cooperate in this, | will do the same. 

Likewise, one assures so certainly and constantly that 
the king of Hungary is slain that | am completely in doubt.

foreshadow the Last Day, since God is doing such works 
on the highest kings at this time. This is the purpose of so

Luther reports on his literary works.

To the servant of God, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, 

bishop of the church at Zwickau, his superior in the 
Lord. 

Grace and peace! Here was nothing new, my dear 
Nicolaus, what this bookseller could have brought, 
because the book of warfare is not yet finished, but it is 
promoted from day to day in print. 

| deal with the fact that Zechariah is to follow 
Habakkuk and Jonah. The preacher Solomon troubles 
me a lot, as if he did not want to be read, but he is forced 
to be read; so much has this book been lying low until 
now. You are right in saying that the world is going to 
ruin; | also hope that the day of the appearance of the 
coming of the great God is near, so much do all things 
everywhere glow, burn, waver, fall, tumble, rage. But you 
be well and pray for me. On the Sunday after Dionysius

Luther consoles and strengthens him in his trials and 
tribulations, which he had to endure in the fight with the 
predominantly strong Zwinglischet' party in Augsburg (only 
Stephan Agricola [Kastenbauer] was on his side), and promises 
that he will write against the Sacramentirans.

To the Herru Doctor Johann Frosch,” the exceedingly 

faithful herald of Christ in the city of Augsburg. 

Grace and peace! Christ keep you and yours, my 
dear frog (Rana), but remember in this challenge that 
many must be angry, and few will be chosen who will 
endure. Satan is now raging out of approval of God 
because of the ingratitude and contempt of His word, 
which few understand, as | have always foretold, it would 
happen that we ungrateful people would be struck with 
wars and mobs. You be strong and support your little 
group. They may rage, rule and triumph; he who is in us 
is greater than he who is in them [1 John 4:4]. | am 
burning with desire to confess my faith once again and to 
show their mockery with a few words (for they 
themselves no longer hear), and | would have done it 
long ago if | had not lacked the time and Satan himself 
had prevented me. But | will make an effort, if Christ is 
gracious to me and you pray for me to come forward. 
Your letter and that of Martin Weiss are with me and are 
before me, because | have always been anxious to deal 
with these matters publicly. Now the hurried messenger 
does not allow me to write anything more. Farewell in 
Christ and comfort and greet the brethren. Wittenberg,

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! M. Caspar Schalbe is still in 
misery and out of Eisenach, not without great harm and 
trouble, as E. C. F. G. well know to consider: | now 
humbly ask E. C. F. G. to put an end to the matter, and 
to order the good man to leave Eisenach. C. F. G. would 
put an end to the matter, give orders, and let the good 
man be helped home again; for if it were true (as | do not 
hope), we are human beings, and may such afflictions be 
corrected with a fair punishment. May God mercifully 
command him E. C. F. G., Amen. Thursday after

1) In the old edition of Walch, the date is: "Monday after 
Martini" (November 12) instead of: "Wednesday" in De Wette and 
in the Erlanger. The same error also in the St. Louis edition, but 
in the preface to the 10th volume, Col. 79, the correct date is set. 

2) This letter is erroneously placed in the year 1528 in the 
editions, which Burkhardt, p. 112, has already pointed out. It 
certainly belongs to the year 1526, as can be seen from the 
answer of the Elector on November 26, 1526 and from a later 
letter of Luther to the Elector on March 1, 1527.

Duke George had known how to obtain either the manuscript 
or the copy of Luther's intended "Gegenschrift Wider den 
Mainzer Rathschlag" (St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 339 ff.), which 
had been suppressed by the Elector, and already on July 4 he 
complained about it to the Elector through Andreas Pflug, bailiff 
at Leipzig. The Elector promised to approach Luthern about it 
and to send his answer to Duke George. However, the Elector 
was already busy with his departure for the Diet of Speier, and 
his letter to Luther did not arrive until after his return from the Diet 
on September 10. On September 15, he apologized to Duke 
George for the delay, and promised to write to Luther now, and 
on November 16, he sent the copy of our letter to Duke George.

Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable and highly 
esteemed, dear lords and good friends! This is my 
answer to your request, which you sent and complained 
to my lord about the booklet | should have printed about 
the priests' counsel, and about Duke Jdérgen, who 
complained as if he should be reviled in it, to his lordship: 

First, that you will excuse me against my most 
gracious lord. After His Lordship had suggested to me 
that the same booklet, when it was started, even by his 
own intention long before, rather than Duke Jérge might 
pray for it, not to let it go out, nor to let it come from me 
(which is now also dear to me myself, because God has 
let the bloodthirsty priests not to carry out their 
murderous counsel before the Emperor. Maj., and did 
more than | might have done with the booklet): so | would 
not have provided myself with such complaints from 
Duke J6rgen, and not only that, but because the same 
booklet was taken from me secretly and not in any proper 
way, or copied, and would well like to suffer that it could 
be learned how the same booklet was obtained and 
brought to me or copied; for my Lord Elector or Duke 
would have it known. Lord Elector or Duke Jorge himself 
would not like to suffer that letters or trades were secretly 
transcribed in their offices.

No. 1033. 
(Wittenberg.) November 22, 1526. 


To the Elector John of Saxony. 


Luther applies for a church visitation. He asks for Carlstadt to 
be allowed to live in Kemberg. 


Printed in the Altenburg edition, vol. Ill, p. 519; in the Leipzig 
edition, vol. XIX, p. 554; in Walch, vol. XXI, 156; in De Wette, vol. 
Ill, p. 135 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 386. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most noble, highborn 
prince, most gracious lord! | have not brought E. C. F. G. 
supplication for a long time, they have now gathered, E. 
C. F. G. wanted to have patience; it will not and cannot 
be otherwise. 

First of all, most gracious Lord, the parish priests are 
complaining beyond measure almost in all places. The 
peasants no longer want to give anything, and there is 
such ingratitude among the people for the holy word of 
God that there is undoubtedly a great plague from God; 
and if | knew how to do it with a good conscience, | would 
well "help" that they have no pastor or preacher, and live 
like swine, when they do: there is no longer any fear of 
God or discipline, because the pope's ban has gone, and 
everyone does whatever he wants. 

But because we are all commanded, especially the 
authorities, above all to educate the poor youth who are 
born and grow up every day, and to keep them in the fear 
of God and in discipline, we must have schools and 
preachers and pastors. If parents do not want to do this, 
they can always go to the devil. But where the youth 
neglects and remains uneducated, it is the fault of the 
authorities, and the country becomes full of wild, loose 
people, so that not only God's commandment, but also 
the need of all of us, forces us to turn away from this. 

But now in E. C. F. G. principality, papal and 
ecclesiastical compulsion and order is over, and all 
monasteries and convents fall into the hands of E. C. F. 
G., as the supreme head, there comes at the same time 
also the duty and complaint to order such a thing; for no 
one else accepts it, nor can, nor should. Therefore, as | 
have talked everything over with E. C. F. G. Chancellor, 
also Mr. Niclas von Ende, it will be necessary to ask E. 
C. F. G. in the most conducive way. 





F. G., as God has required and authorized in such a case, 
to have four persons visit the land; two who are 
responsible for interest and goods; two who are 
responsible for doctrine and persons, so that these 
persons, by order of E. C. F. G., may establish and care 
for the schools and parishes where necessary. 

Where there is a town or village that is of property, the 
C.C.F.G. has the power to compel them to keep schools, 
preaching stations, and parishes. If they do not want to 
do it for their own happiness, E. C. F. G. is there as the 
supreme guardian of the youth and of all who need it, and 
shall force them to do it; just as if they were forced by 
force to give and serve for bridges, footpaths and roads, 
or for any other accidental necessity of the country. 

What the land needs and requires, those who use and 
enjoy the land shall give and help. Now there is no need 
for people to come and rule after us. But if they have no 
property and are otherwise too heavily burdened, then 
the monastery estates, which are primarily endowed for 
this purpose and are still to be used for this purpose, are 
to be spared the common man all the more. For it is easy 
for the C.C.F.G. to mean that in the end there would be 
an evil clamor, and it is also not justifiable where the 
schools and parishes lie low, and the nobility should bring 
the monastery estates to themselves; as is already said, 
and also done by some. Since such estates do not 
improve anything in the C.C.F.G. Chamber, and are 
finally endowed for church service, they should serve this 
purpose first and foremost. What is left after that may be 
used by the C.F.G. for the needs of the country or for poor 
people. 

On the other hand: D. Carlstadt has asked me very 
much to write to E. C. F. G. for mercy, so that he may live 
in Kemberg; otherwise he cannot stay in the villages 
because of the malice of the peasants, as E. C. F. G. can 
hear from this letter of his, and also from Hans von 
Grafendorf, and yet he is afraid to write to E. C. F. G. 
himself. Because he has so far been silent publicly, and 
our one part, also Hans Metsch, Captain, consider it good 
that the Provost 1) at Kem

him this, although E. C. F. G. has already done much

departure, in his place as pastor. Now it is true, he is a 
pious, learned man. But | also have to report to E. C. F. 
G. that the people of Schweinitz, as well as almost all 
commoners from time to time, want to appoint pastors 
on other people's property, and give nothing themselves, 
and feed no one. Whoever wants to have the power and 
right to appoint, should also be obligated and obliged to 
feed, and not call, build or free on another's property.

The concept is in the Weimar Archives, N, p. 367, No. 183. 3. 
Printed by Burkhardt, p. 114 and in Erl. Briefw., Vol. V, p. 407. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear 
devotee! We have read all the contents of your letter 
concerning the establishment of parishes, schools 
and Doctor Carolstat, and as far as the establishment 
of parishes and schools is concerned, we also find 
daily that there is a great lack of ours in this area, and 
we do not like to hear it. Since we have judged and 
considered among ourselves that we, as the 
sovereign, are due to see to it, you know that we have 
ordered our advisors and dear faithful, Gregory 
Brick, Chancellor, and Hansen von Grefendorf, 
whom we left behind us in Wittenberg for this and 
other matters, to have a conversation with you and 
the four deans 1) about it. When the same two, 
coming to us again, reported to us that they 
considered it good with you up to our favor, that one 
person or two from the university, and from us 
someone from the council, should be ordered to visit 
our cities, towns and villages, if the necessity requires 
it, and the agreement should have been that persons 
from the university, suitable for this, should be 
appointed to us in writing, We do not know how to 
convince you that such a discussion, which ours had 
with you and the four deans, will please us. We also 
want to appoint two of our councilors, whom we will 
consider suitable and useful for such a visitation, and 
we will not let the costs, which will result from it, be 
lost for the good of the matter. However, we 
graciously request that you be present at our 
university, so that we can make use of two per

If you compare the names of the persons and 
teachers 1) who are to be paid attention to, and if you 
name and identify them to us, you and they shall be 
left to our discretion as to the time and place at which 
we first want to carry out and have carried out such a 
visitation. 

Secondly, we have also heard what you have 
written to us concerning Doctor Carolstat, to the effect 
that we have noted his complaints and objections 
from his letter 2). Now we know not to leave it 
undisclosed to you in your gracious opinion that all 
sorts of things were said on his account when we were 
at the Diet of Speier, and in particular our councilors, 
whom we used there as a committee in the affairs of 
the realm, have indicated to us that some have 
publicly said that the said Carlstat should not refrain 
from writing to some of those who are dependent on 
his established sect, and to strengthen them in this 
way, 3) in which way, also with what measure and 
happened promise the said Carlstat would be suffered 
by us at this time in our lands in the best, so much 
might have happened that we could no longer have 
known him in our princedoms. We_ therefore 
graciously request that Carlstat be reminded to keep 
his promise and to dispense with letters and other 
things that serve to strengthen the affected sect, and 
we want to have it done, according to your 
intercession, that he may turn to Kemberg, which you 
may also indicate to him on our behalf. We request, 
however, that you inform and order the provost of 
Kemberg and others, whom you respect in this 
regard, to have good respect for the man's character 
and actions, as well as for the people who will come 
to him. For if it should happen to us that he writes 
outside of the country or praises or otherwise 
strengthens the affected sect in our countries and 
principalities, he would have to consider what 
displeasure we would bear and what we would be 
caused to do because of it. We have not wished to 
restrain you from this, and are inclined to you with 
graciousness and good. Date Weimar, Monday after 
Catharine [Nov. 26] Anno 26. 


1) The Elector later appointed Hans von der Planitz and Asmus 
von Hanbitz as visitators; the university appointed Melanchthon 
and Hieronymus Schurs. - The visitation began on February 13, 
1527. 

2) No. 1032. 

3) The meaning of this passage will probably be: and if it had 
come to that, that our councilors would have had to report on it

Notes. 


Concerning Caspar Schalken, of whom you wrote 
to us in another letter, we would be well inclined to 
procure at your request that he be secured to his own. 
However, we cannot reproach you for the fact that we 
have received such a report on account of his actions 
and things, and that he has now been absconding for 
some time, so that we may not consider him innocent. 
If he should now be admitted without punishment, you 
are to consider to what imposition such a thing will be 
sufficient for us. If, however, he is inclined to carry out 
his innocence, as is fair, or to get along with the 
mistress and others, so that no one has cause, even 
if it is done secretly, to complain about it, then, at his 
request, we will gladly order our bailiff at Wartburg or 
someone else who is in a position to do so, to act in 
one of the ways indicated.

Grace and peace be with you in the Lord! You write 
strange things about your Liegnitz, my dear Cordatus, 
that in one and the same place the spirit is so powerful 
and the flesh at the same time, since the former boast 
nothing but spirit and the latter live nothing but flesh. 
But although this is a common corruption in the whole 
world, namely, the overindulgence in words, you must 
still try and stop it. 5) Who knows whether God does 
not want to do the opposite and a new thing in this 
place, that just as elsewhere the zeal for the gospel 
first glows and then is cold, so there it should first be 
cold and then glow. May God grant that this people 
may be the son who first refuses to go into the 
vineyard, and after that

more than one wife, not only because it is annoying, and 
no Christian should give trouble without need, but should 
avoid it most diligently, but also because there is no word 
of God here, on which one may rely, so that God is 
pleased with Christians. Pagans and Turks may do as 
they please. The ancient fathers had many wives, but 
they were forced to do so by necessity, as Abraham and 
Jacob, and after them many kings, to whom the wives of 
their friends died as an inheritance according to the laws

Grace and peace. Honorable and firm, dear lord and

more than one wife in marriage? This is my answer: The 
unbelievers may do as they please, but Christian liberty 
should be directed by love, so that everything should be 
directed to the service of the neighbor, where it can be 
done without necessity and error of faith and conscience; 
but now everyone wants to seek the liberty that serves 
and is useful to him, taking nothing into account, neither 
the neighbor's benefit nor improvement, even though St. 
Paul says: Omnia licent, sed non omnia expediunt,

occasionem carnis detis etc. It is also free to prostitute 
oneself, or to live without them; but who will do it without 
need, with a good conscience? Even if the ancients had 
many wives, Christians are not to follow such an 
example, because there is no necessity, nor correction, 
nor especially God's word, that commands such a thing, 
and so great trouble and unrest may come from it. For 
this reason, | do not consider Christians to be any more 
free, since God would have to command such freedom 
beforehand.

remark: "/atein. We give here the text according to the second

A Counsel by Doctor Martini Luther on 
How to Establish and Complete a 
Permanent Order in the Christian 
Community. 1526. 


Because this next upheaval has so wrought havoc on 

us that it is easy to see what evil will come of it if we do 
not see to it that the common man's mind is quieted and 
united as much as possible, it is necessary to do this not 
only by force, as is already the case, but also by reason. 
For force without reason cannot endure, and keeps the 
subjects in eternal hatred of the rulers, as all history 
shows us. 
Now one cannot deny that in the mob, from many years 
ago, unwillingness has grown up and evil delusion has 
taken hold of the dishonest life of the spiritual state, and 
since one does not want to improve it, but rather defends 
it with defiance against all fairness, the delusion has 
become a

905 


The result is such misery as unfortunately exists; 
therefore, the first thing to do is to reform the state, or 
the pen will not come out of the heart. 

The first thing to be done here is to approach your 
main task, namely, the mass, so that it is performed ina 
Christian, common, unanimous manner, in which God 
and men may be pleased and satisfied. The manner, 
however, must be taken from the divine word, without 
which no order is unanimous and constant, since nothing 
so powerfully fills the mouths and quiets the hearts of all 
men as the divine word. Words of men certainly cause 
sects and unequal ways, as one can see before one's 
eyes all over the world. 

It is obvious and cannot be denied by the clergy 
themselves, how in the whole world such a terrible 
abomination and horrible misuse of the reverend 
Sacrament of our Lord Jesus Christ's body and blood is 
going on, namely the great cruel misuse, which even 
reason without Scripture recognizes and condemns, that 
a loud fair and manipulation has been made of the holy 
sacrament, since Christ, the Holy Spirit, grace, life, 
heaven, forgiveness of sins, and redemption from hell 
and purgatory have been sold; yes, even if a sow is sick, 
or has lost a penny, or some other small misfortune 
befalls you: all this is sought to be averted by the Mass 
with money, so that the Mass has been free, open and 
ready to obtain a merchant's office against all kinds of 
misfortune on earth with a penny or half a penny for 
anyone, whether pious or wicked, regardless of faith, 
love and all God's glory and salvation. -For even if, 
among a hundred thousand, one or a few more might be 
found to keep mass for God's sake, the others and the 
common state 1) are abused, so that, if there were no 
money, no one respects the mass or is directed to help 
anyone with it. For for this purpose monasteries and 
churches have been founded, into which one does not 
go other than to feed one's belly and have good days 
through the abominable and blasphemous creed of 
divine service and the masses; this is no different and no 
one can deny it. 


1) That is, the state of the clergy in general. 


S06 


Moreover, it is seen and grasped that this creedalism 
and money-making by 1) Christ's blood is not applied to 
pious poor people, but the majority to the clergy, who lie 
in carnal uncleanness, as Paul calls it, also in public 
fornication, adultery and all disgraces, Many of them are 
drunkards and full of impiety, and live blamelessly in all 
these under the appearance and protection of spiritual 
status.?) So, impudent and unclean, they go desperately 
to the altar, that is, to their merchant's booth, trade and 
torture, sell and exchange the dear Christ. If there were 
no abomination on earth, this alone would be enough for 
God's wrath to carry us away, like Sodom and Gomorrah. 

And indeed, God has let himself be noticed in this 
uproar, if we wanted to open our eyes, that the misery 
has been inflicted on the clergy and for the sake of the 
clergy, as they protect and suffer such abominations, and 
finally, as a common punishment, has gone out on the 
rabble, who have also followed and served such 
abominations, and there is no end to it yet; In addition, it 
is to be feared that it was a fox's tail, and where one will 
not yet do anything to put an end to such a public, known 
abomination, but will handle and tolerate it insolently and 
as if in defiance of God, the iron rod will follow afterwards. 

Therefore, it is advisable that all masses be dismissed 
with a final common judgment, and that one does not 
intend to keep them and to improve them with the 
patchwork of a glittering reformation. For where the mass 
should remain as it is now, it is impossible to prevent it 
from becoming a creed, unless others are ordained to 
attend masses, since they are and must be vain idlers 
who have no office to serve the word and neighbor, for 
which Christ actually instituted this sacrament. But where 
there is idleness, all vices follow, so that it cannot be 
advised here that the ministers of the Mass should be 
given the office of the word; those who are not able to do 
this should not say Mass either. Otherwise, the useless 
people will be and are too many, and because they 
almost 


1) Thus Spalatin; in print: "an". 
2) Erlanger: "Life. 


Letters from the year 1526. No. 1046. 


907 


If they are vain belly servants and idlers who serve no 
one, but let them serve, the annoyance and vexation of 
both God and man will not cease. 

If we had ordered this main part correctly, then the 
other part, as it depends on it, would be easy to advise. 
But if one does not want to do this, then | would not like 
to advise the other orders, because this is in vain and a 
vain wasted effort, which is broken by the handling of the 
measurements. The source of the abomination must be 
stopped, otherwise the rivers and streams will not dry up. 

Above all this, the mass is even more abominable and 
abusive; For even if it were without outward gross abuse 
and not a creed, but were kept for God's sake, since it is 
kept as a sacrifice and good work, and not in memory of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, as he instituted it, Christians' 
consciences are also built on it, as if they should be saved 
by offering Christ in the mass, so that faith is destroyed 
and the one sacrifice that Christ offered himself once for 
us is forgotten and despised, which should be 
remembered with great diligence in the mass. But to 
destroy faith and make a selfish work and sacrifice out of 
a divine common treasure of souls is such a perversion 
3) and abomination that no man's heart can comprehend 
it. Therefore, it is necessary to look into this matter with 
seriousness and haste, before God overpowers us with 
His wrath. 


To say that it was decided by imperial mandate 
at the Diet of Worms, one should stick to the old 
Christian custom and practice: 


It is obvious that in the same mandate nothing at all is 
commanded about the abuse of the masses; although, as 
| said, they know it well, and nevertheless pretend not to 
see it, and jump over it, as if it did not concern us, so that 
God is nevertheless despised to the highest degree and 
his honor is forgotten. Therefore, from the attitude of such 
an imperial mandate, such a pity has come that, just as 
they have ignored God's 


3) In print: "Devastation". 


908 Letters from the year 1526 and 


1527. no. 1046. 1047. 1048. 909 





have forgotten, despised his honor and enraged him, 
again both spiritual and temporal authorities have come 
into such contempt and hatred, and are still daily in it, and 
the longer the deeper they get into it, the more that no 
good can ever come of it, as the rebellion has begun and 
indicated, and thus the saying of God is fulfilled 1 Sam. 
2:30: "Whoever honors me, him | will also honor, but 
whoever despises me _ shall be despised again. 
Therefore, the Wormsian mandate is far too little to 
maintain good order, because it despises and lets go of 
such public vice and abomination, and does nothing to 
promote divine honor and put away the blasphemy and 
dishonor of His name. 

And if the mass were properly ordered, it would be 
necessary to have good, pious preachers. In this case, it 
will depend on the people who have to be educated in 
schools and universities. Therefore, reformation of 
schools and universities is necessary, so that no expense! 
or effort is spared. This must be especially well thought 
of, for where the schools are not well established, where 
people are to be trained and educated, no church service 
will be advisable. But perhaps the empire will not accept 
this, but will leave it to each dominion to provide in its 
country. But it is necessary and the highest article of one. 

But what to make of foundations, monasteries and 
bishoprics, | do not know. If they remain like this, they do 
not serve God and do not wait for the word. But if the 
bishops visit, as is their office, they may not wait for the 
word. But this is to be considered, because they bear the 
name and rank of bishops, abbots, deans, and yet they 
do not rule, but are secular lords, that they are also in the 
rank to great dishonor and dishonor of God, and it would 
be a thousand times better that they let themselves be 
changed into secular rank, and that such estates be 
taken in fief from the realm and given to those who are 
found worthy of it, as otherwise happens when a lordship 
dies. For it is no different than that through the gospel the 
bishoprics 1) all die off and fall to the founders or the 
kingdom; for the names of the bishoprics 1) all die off. 


1) In print: "Bishops. 





Bishop, abbot, provost, dean, scholasticus, cantor,

Grace and peace in the Lord! That it is not my fault that 
| write to you less often, my dear Spalatin, these enclosed 
letters shall be my witnesses, for they waited for a 
messenger, as they were always before my eyes. You 
will recognize from the months, days, and the matter in 
which they are written, that | myself had forgotten the 
things, and finally, overcome by annoyance, unsealed 
them again to see what | would have written. Yes, in the 
case of the last messenger, | had very much intended 
that he should not leave without my letters to you, for the 
sake of the Schésser at Eisenberg 1); but even so | did 
not get anything. When | went down to look for him - 
perhaps his presence had been reported to me too late - 
| was told that he had lost patience and had gone away. 
At the same time, | was displeased with my people. That's 
how it goes: What does not concern you, you do not care 
about. But remember for yourself whether | used to 
behave like this when you were at court, that is, when you 
told me about certain messengers or certain publicans 
who were supposed to deliver my letters to you. But now 
| have to use random messengers; how many of them, | 
pray you, ask for letters, or deliver them, or desire them, 
or wait for them? 2) This is my excuse, because | do not 
want to put my many affairs before you, since there are 
none that could prevent me from writing to you, since | 
am sure from your manner, which | know, that even a 
letter written during the meal would be pleasant to you. 

To the matter. You should tell our very dear Dolzig that 
if he tolerates a friendly quarrel (as he does), we do not 
lack a reason for claiming that it should sometimes be 
written "darumb", sometimes "drumb". For why should we 
Germans not follow the Greeks, the Latins, and the 
Hebrews in contractions and abbreviations 3) since there 
is scarcely any language

that shortens more than the German one? With an 
abbreviation we say: "thou shalt do it to me", which 
according to Dolzig's strictness should be said: "thou 
shalt do it to me". See what sweetness the abbreviation 
has and what repulsiveness the rule. If one asks, "Why 
do you do this?" we regularly answer, "Because of this," 
because the word stands alone; again, when words are 
added, it is said with graceful abbreviation, "I will not let 
it be because of this." How peevishly would one say this: 
"| will not let it be about this"? To the Thuringians with 
these un-Germanic Germanisms! You see how 
perceptive we are, too. Therefore, Dolzig may beware of 
a grammatical fight, especially if he undertakes to irritate 
us, since we seem to be double, triple, yes, quadruple 
people like Aristarchus 4). This in jest. 

Very serious, my dear Spalatin, is the matter 
concerning the robbery of the monasteries, and, believe 
me, that it troubles me very much. What you desire, | 
have long since pursued with writings. Not satisfied with 
that, | (when the prince was here) even entered the 
prince's chamber against everyone's will in order to talk 
to him alone about this matter. Only "Riedesel" was 
present. Unawares, | approached the prince and 
complained about what you write, after | had also 
complained about the same thing to the younger prince 
in the antechamber, and he indicated that he disliked 
such things. He answered that they would take care that 
everything would be done properly. What should | say? 
Under the best of princes, | am afraid that | and all of us 
will be given a blue haze, empty appearances and fairy 
tales, so that we will not even be required to know the 
originators. They think Frederick is dead; in this opinion 
they are kings in this country, God grant that this does 
not happen so happily. And that is the sourest vinegar to 
me, that those who before as enemies of the Gospel

Frederick in godliness, now, on the occasion of the loot,

About that, most gracious sir, although | am ashamed, 
and begging is much, but | must do it. The licentiate 
Basilius, whom E. C. F. G. had given the year XXX by C. 
Blancken, but now accepted as a physician at Torgau, 
truly on sufficient pay and hired service, he would like to 
become a doctor for more prestige, which such an office 
requires. If now E. C. F. G. would once again let give the 
same XXX Gilden for the last time, it would be necessary 
and good, but | want it in E. C. F. G.'s gracious will. 

Otherwise, there is a poor citizen here who has been 
ill and spoiled for a whole year with his wife, who now 
cannot get ready for food again, who is deteriorating the

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, 
gracious lord! To the order sent to me by E. F. G. and 
requesting my opinion on it, | reply as follows 


We do not like it, because many blame us in Wittenberg, 
as if we did not want to let anyone count for anything 
without us, when we, God knows, well wish that everyone 
would do the very best without us. But for the service of 
E. F. G., and because such an order might go out with a 
clamor, as if my speech had also come to this, it is my 
faithful, submissive advice that E. F. G. does not permit 
this order to be omitted by printing at this time, because | 
[could not] be so bold so far, and also cannot be so bold 
yet, to introduce such a heap of laws with such powerful 
words among us. That would be my opinion, as Moses 
has done with his laws, which he has taken, written out 
and ordered almost the whole part, as already in use 
among the people of old tradition. So also E. F. G. first 
provided the parishes and schools with good persons and 
tried beforehand by verbal order or drawn on slips of 
paper and all that in the shortest and least what they 
should do. And which would be even better, that the 
parish priests first of all of their three, six, name among 
themselves began a unanimous way in one or three, five, 
six pieces, until in practice and Schwang would come, 
and then further and more, as thing would probably give 
itself and force, until so long all pastors followed. Then it 
could be put into a small booklet, for | know well and have 
experienced well that when laws are set too early before 
custom and practice, they seldom turn out well; people 
are not skilled in this, as those think who sit there by 
themselves, and do it with words and thoughts, as it 
should go. Prescribing and doing are far apart. And 
experience will show that many parts of this order will 
have to change, and some will remain alone with the 
authorities. If, however, some of the pieces were to come 
into force and custom, it would then be easy to add to 
them and put them in order. Furthermore, making law is 
a great, dangerous, extensive thing, and without God's 
Spirit nothing good will come of it. Therefore, approach 
with fear and humility before God, and keep this measure: 
Short and good, little and well, gently and always on. After 
that, when they take root, more would follow from the act 
of faith itself than is necessary, as must Christ, the 
Romans, the Pope, and all the faithful.

hear the face of the world before you? Rather, we

on the night [of the feast] of the Circumcision, during the 
early Mass in the main church, all the chandeliers and 
lamps suddenly went out, except for the one in front of 
the Sacrament. But there are so many, especially those 
lit during High Mass, and so many hidden corners of the 
chapels, that it is impossible for them to be extinguished 
by the wind (which cannot reach them). Some interpret it 
in such a way that the death of the canons is thereby 
foreshadowed; thus, it is said, it also happened in the past 
that when Bishop Ernst 3) was dying, the great chandelier 
fell down, went out and broke, and, as he lay, lit another 
one. God will watch. Many signs are happening that will 
not be in vain. | again go against the Sacramentirans; 
pray for me that Christ will give me happiness in His 
cause. | expect the seeds for the garden at the future

previously graciously put off M. Caspar Schalben, a 
citizen of Eisenach, when he had made up with the maid 
who had accused him, they would graciously help him 
back to his own; since this has now happened and yet 
some of the council of Eisenach are still trying to 
strengthen his disgrace, my humble request is therefore 
that E. C. F. G. continue and graciously protect him 
against such people's mouths and insolence. C. F. G. will 
thus continue, and graciously protect and handle him 
against such people's mouths and nobility, as he relies on 
E. C. F. G. and puts him off. E. C. F. G. will without doubt 
graciously know how to keep to this. At Wittenberg, Friday

No. 1071 to 1074. 931 





In the public theater of London, where Christians and 
unbelievers stand together and listen, as happens in the 
church, one should also punish in general, and all kinds 
of unbelief and bad behavior, and no one should be 
singled out. For it is a common sermon and should 
remain common, and no one should be ashamed and 
reddened in front of others until they are separated and 
come into the assembly, where they are properly 
admonished, prayed for and punished. But if he has a 
desire to punish publicly, let him do it to those who first 
attack him publicly, as | do to the papists and zealots. 
Otherwise he shall stop, and make no attachment, nor 
contempt of persons. For such punishments mend no 
one's ways, but they doom the rabble, and atone for the 
punisher's pleasure. | ask you to report this to the 
honorable council for my sake and for your sake and for 
yourselves, and to watch over it diligently. For Satan does 
not sleep and always seeks to cause misfortune. Hereby

Of Mr. Leonhard Kaiser in Bavaria, burned for the 
sake of the Gospel, a blessed story. 


The report about the martyrdom of Leonhard Kaiser (more 
correctly: Kaser) first appeared before October 1527 under the 
title: "Histori oder dz warhasftig geschieht, des leydens vnd 
sterbens Lienhart Keysers. seligen, etwa Pfarrers zu

5) In the 20th picture of that scripture, Osiander had put a monk 
in the place of the pope, who holds a rose in his right hand and a 
sickle in his left hand, and under it the words: "But so that one 
sees who the monk is, he stands there in his clothing and has his 
sign, the rose, in his hand, | think it is Luther. But because Isaiah 
saith, All flesh is as grass, he standeth there with a sickle, and 
cutteth it off, not grass, but flesh, and all that is carnal 2c. For 
against this he preaches, and when it is extinguished, he will 
strike again with the iron of fire the fire of Christian love, which is 
extinguished, and kindle it."

2c., and failed to do so for two years. 

After that, when a letter came to him from his 
brothers and friends, saying that his father was in 
mortal danger and that he wanted to see his father 
alive, he came out and, out of the love of his father 
and brothers, resigned himself and went to Rab, 
where he found his father alive within two hours. After 
that, he stayed at Rab with his mother and brothers, 
and he also became weak, so he stayed there for five 
weeks. In such a state he was reported by the parish 
priest there at Rab, and the parish priest reported his 
future to the abbot of Stiben and the bishop of Passau 
by letters and persons. 

After this, the prince of Passau sent a letter to the 
judge at Rab, asking him to have Lenhard imprisoned. 
The judge had Lenharden read this document himself, 
and the judge imprisoned him. Then he was kept in 
their court on the third day, then delivered for the court 
to the district court of Scharding on the 10th day of 
March Anno 27, and led to Scharding. On the other 
morning, as on the 11th day of March, he was led to 
Passau on the water, then imprisoned in the 
Oberhaus or castle, and examined several times in 
the presence of Doctor Ramelsbach, preacher at 
Passau, and Officials, parish priest at St. Paul and 
canon, Doctor Rosin, canon, and Doctor Fréschel, 
canon 2c. 

The prince has also spoken to him personally, but 
his answer has always been: according to divine 
Scripture he wants to be reprimanded, otherwise with 
nothing, even with revenge, he should be sent to 
some cities of the empire, such as Nuremberg, 
Augsburg, Ulm and the like, at his and his friends’ 
expense, and there present the alleged crime. If he is 
found to be in the wrong, he shall pay for it without 
any mercy, but if he is not due, 1) nor overcome with 
holy scripture, he shall not be charged further. But as 
they questioned and examined him

nirt, and what his answer has been, we will best hear 
from his own handwriting, which has come to me,” 
and reads thus: 


Grace through Christ. 


Friendly, dear brothers in Christ! | let you know that 
on the day of Pentecost 3) | was required to be 
interrogated, and there | was asked to answer briefly 
and to give my opinion on all the articles that were 
rejected by Doctor Martinum, and which are strictly 
contrary to God's Word, and are not yet founded in the 
Holy Scriptures. 


But now you can well notice that this wolf's 
presumption is nothing else but a thurst to muffle 
divine word and to condemn innocent blood, also no 
love to instruct the erring one, as me or one of my 
equals, according to their eighth, only inclined to 
condemn outright and cunning, also not to let any 
saying of the Scripture remain with his right mind, but 
must be violated and desecrated as devilish, heretical, 
Lutheran doctrine. 

Who would consider it Christian, brotherly love that 
a weak, sick person should be put into a heavy prison 
for a while, and then hurriedly, unawares, begin to 
respond to such excellent articles concerning the 
salvation of the soul? Since even high authorities in 
such respectable matters and necessary articles 
would not be allowed eight days, but half a year or a 
whole year, to which | would not be able to untie the 
laces with my intellect, you may understand what 
tyranny is used to search the consciences of men and 
to reform them according to their head, which is God's 
doing and work alone. 

Now | would like to show you the articles to which 
| have had to answer, but | must say that a good part 
of them has fallen away from me, but nevertheless, 
according to my simple mind, and in accordance with 
the word of God, | have answered them, because you 
have good knowledge, since God's word is accused 
of heretical, diabolical, seductive, Lutheran doctrine 
among them, | also, who am accused by them of being 
a heretic, diabolical, seductive, Lutheran doctrine. 


2) This passage seems to us to be full proof that everything 
preceding (not only the letter "to all Christians", as Kédstlin, M. 
Luther, p. 643 ad p. 113 states) was written by Luther. 

3) Here the Jena edition has the marginal gloss: "This is 
Dornstag. - According to the document that immediately follows 
Leonhard Kaiser's handwriting, "a legal day has been set for July 
11," which was a Thursday. This letter is therefore written soon 
after July 11.

| have been taken for an erring, deceived man, blinded 
with false doctrine; also where already writings have 
been denounced, unseemly and utterly rejected by 
them, also not allowed to listen, to speak out my 
distress. 

One article or six other examinations have been 
held up to me by them, which in part have fallen away 
from me, as first of all: what | think of the Conciliis; 
what of the primacy or supremacy of the pope; what of 
his statutes and the like? 2c. 

(1) But the first article, now held up to me this time, 
was whether faith alone, without works, makes one 
justified? Answer: Yes. [I have shown Scripture from 
the Old and New Testaments, but [it is] denied by 
them, and it has not been given me leave to argue. 

(2) Secondly, concerning works, what are they, if 
faith alone justifies? | answered: that faith alone acts 
before God, but works are signs of my faith; these 
must be left down with the neighbor, to serve him with 
them, and not to lead him over himself before God. 
One must separate faith and works as far as heaven 
and earth, angels and devils. Only do nothing before 
God with works, but leave the glory to Christ alone, 
that he has bought us with his blood and has done 
more than too much for all men's sins, and believe this, 
rely on it completely and die on it: faith is enough 
before God and makes us children of God, heirs to his 
kingdom, co-heirs with Christ, and partakers of all his 


Letters from the year 1527. no. 1086. 


947 


4. what the great and small canon and what | think 
of it? Answer: because they both say only about 
sacrifice, and the will is a gift and not a sacrifice, so | 
do not think anything of it 2c. 

5th Item, fifth, about the confession? Answer: 
[There are three kinds of confession. The first of faith, 
which is necessary daily, Ps. 32:5: "I said, | will 
confess," 2c. The other of love, and is, if | have 
loffended my neighbor, [that] | reconcile myself with 
him, of which Matth. 5, 23. f. and 18, 18. The third of 
counsel, and not to be despised. For where | know to 
fetch God's promise, | should not despise it, but lament 
my distress, there receive God's word, and rejoice in 
Imy request, and believe that | will be helped 2c. 

(6) Item, repentance and atonement? Answer: | 
know of no other atonement than that of Christ, that is, 
His blood, suffering and death given for us. 

(7) What then are repentance, confession, fasting, 
prayer, and the like? Answer: In all these there is 
neither satisfaction nor payment, but are signs of 
thanksgiving to those who are redeemed by Christ's 
shedding of innocent blood, suffering and death. 

8. item, about the sacrament of the last rites? Said: 
that for this reason no scripture is sufficient for me, that 
it should be a sacrament, but that it was the custom of 
ithe Jews to visit the sick and there to pour delicious 

intment or water on them to help their weak, sick 
bodies and to give them refreshment, which is what

gladly be without them; the struggle remains until our 
pit. Now in such a case, the Christian man is like 
minded toward God: God hates sin, and so does 4 
Christian man, even if he feels sin, even if he falls inta 
it. 


Item 14: What is Christian freedom? ha 


On the other hand, God wants us not to sin. A 
Christian man also wants to be free of sins. He writheg 
here, he turns there; as he does, he finds two laws in 
him, as Paul did to Romans 2c. Also he is a lord ovet 
all goods of God, all creatures free to use, but that 
through freedom he does not give place to the flesh 
as Paul says Gal. 5, 13. 

15 Item, what about free will? Did | say that to obtain 
external things, man may well have free will to acertain 





"No one can lay a foundation other than the one that 
is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if any man build 
upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stone, 
wood," 2c. has another mind. But | cannot or may not 
allow that there be a purgatory, because all the works 
of God are perfect, and none of His works are wholly 
imperfect. [He] forgives man his faults, or nothing at 
all. It is not necessary to divide God into pieces, so 


{that here he forgives a part of the sins, and in that 


world also a part that is called venial, especially 
because it is an article of faith, since we believe that 
here is forgiveness of sins. 

Now it is known in the day that one cannot believe 
in that world, when sea and body separate, because 
faith and hope end with the death of man. If then faith 
alone receives forgiveness of sins, misery must half 
follow, because the deceased do not have faith nor 
hope for forgiveness of sins, do not receive 
forgiveness of sins, venial or whatever one may call 
them, because we confess that here and not there is 
forgiveness of sins. 


(17) Item, the difference of days? Answer: That to 
Christians there is no difference of days, but one is 
like another. On this Marci 2, 27. f. is indicated: "that 
the Sabbath was created because of man, not man 
because of the Sabbath. That also the child of man is 


extent? 





"one" in the Jena. - Immediately following we have put instead o 


1) "once" put by us instead of "oneest" in the Wittenberg et 
"further": "Weiteres". j 


950 


a Lord of the Sabbath", but it is good, right and proper 
(but not a commandment) to keep [one day] in the 
week, as it is now Sunday, so that the common man, 
who is burdened with his work all week, may come 
together to hear God's word, prayer and supplication 
for all the needs at hand. 

18. item, from the choice or difference to keep the 
food half? Answer: in the food there is no difference 
to be kept; [I have] drawn scriptures; Matth. 15, 11. 
Christ says: "What enters the mouth" 2c. 

19. Item, about the invocation of the saints, 
whether they are also to be invoked or honored, 
whether they may also be our intercessors? Answer: 
That only God is to be called, worshipped and 
honored, in the Book of the Exodus of the Children of 
Israel, Cap. 20, 3. that we have no other mediator than 
Jesus Christ, who is given to us by God as a unique 
mediator, Hebr. 4, 15: "For we do not have a high 
priest who cannot have compassion on our 
weakness." And 1 John 2:1 f.: "Beloved, these things 
write | unto you, that ye sin not. But if any man sin, we 
have an Advocate before God, Christ Jesus, who is 
our propitiation for our sin, and not for our sin only, but 
for the sin of the whole world." 

To this end, | have said that in the saints we see 
the greatness of God, and His unspeakable 
goodness, so that the Almighty God graced the dear 
saints, and especially gave them great faith and 
strength, so that they overcame princedom, kings, 
and all that was mighty before the world, through the 
power and might of faith. Therefore God in His saints, 
and not the saints, are to be praised and glorified. [For 
this reason they are presented to us, so that we may 
see and perceive in them their great faith and 
steadfastness in all adversity. This is the greatest 
honor, so we may prove to them that we are caused 
by them to magnify God and praise His good deeds, 
proven to them. 

20. Item, what about the Mother of God? Answer: 
she is a high, great, worthy person, highly graced by 
God, and indeed, before the foundation of the world, 
provided to become a mother of His most beloved 
Son, and yet by grace without merit. Luc. 1, 30. the 
angel says: "You have found grace with God" 2c. 
Doctor Rosin: Does the Christian church sing: For you 
have deserved to bear 2c. To this | answered that she 
had not deserved it, not even in her 





Letters from the year 1527. No. 1086. 


951 


In her praise song Magnificat, she indicated 
something else, because she wanted to praise and 
extol the mightiness, goodness and mercy of God, 
thereby promising comforting help and support to her 
and all those who are thus reduced and think nothing 
of them, 2c. because she says: "For he has 
considered the nothingness of his servant. For he 
hath shewed me great things, who is mighty, and hath 
exalted them that think not of them. He hath filled the 
hungry with good things, and the rich," the arrogant 
and the work-saintly, as a glorifier, "ne hath left 
empty." 

21. item, whether the pope may condemn 
someone? | do not know how the official raised the 
question. I think he said, as he said: whether the pope 
has the power to condemn? Does the pope have the 
power to condemn? | said: No, because it belongs to 
God alone to condemn. Let it be known how the ban 
is to be used: not to condemn, but to force and shame 
the unruly and recalcitrant, so that they confess their 
sin and suffer for it, so that they are separated from 
the community and thereby caused to desire to be 
received back into the community, as Matt. 18:15: "If 
your brother sins against you," 2c.Just as Paul 
commanded the one who had taken his stepmother 
as a wife, 1 Cor. 5:1, in the absence of his person, but 
still with the spirit in the church, that he should not be 
tolerated any longer, but should be set apart for the 
corruption of the flesh, that is, that he would be 
disgraced and thus despised, so that he later desired 
and asked to be taken back into the church. 

22. Item, what would | think of the fourth line or clan 
number of the friendship of the blood? Whether it was 
proper to marry in the same clan numbers? | do not 
know what my answer would have been about this, or 
whether another question would have intervened; | 
am even in doubt about what I have said. 

Item, another question comes to my mind, and that 
is: what do | think or believe to be under the two forms 
of wine and bread? Answer: that under the two forms 
is understood the true body of the Lord, and that 
under the form of bread, but under the form of wine 
the precious blood of our Lord 2c. 

(23) Whether the whole body and blood of the Lord 
are comprehended in the figure of bread? Then | 
answered, that | believe with simplicity, as the words 
of the author, that is, of Christ, who says, "Take and 
eat, this is my body, which is given for you,” and 
again, "Drink ye all of it. 





952 


Letters from the year 1527. No. 1086. 


953 





Whether among the two figures permanent, or 
transformations? 2c. Then | said, "It is not for me to 
argue about these things; | leave it to the wise. It is 
enough for me that | remain firm in the words of our 
Savior; whether it remains bread or is transformed, it 
is none of my business. Item, another question of my 
time of day 1) half: whether | pray them? Answer: | 
have not prayed much in a year. Says the official: yes, 
perhaps much longer; Lutherans do not usually like to 
pray much. | just kept quiet and thought to myself: you 
might have guessed it (from the times of day). 

To these and other questions more, if a good part 
has undoubtedly fallen away from me, to which my 
simple answer (as you will find such responsibility in 
this), |am condemned by them and through them a far 
astray man and almost far from the path of 
blessedness and divine truth, in addition to which 
these articles are all condemned in the next Concilio, 
and condemned as heretical long before. And should 
the Christian church have erred so long ago, as twelve 
hundred years, and this accursed heretic be right 
[against] so many holy fathers and so much Concilio? 

And | do not know how this speech escaped me, 
that | spoke: | believed that Germany has never had 
the gospel nor heard it rightly. The point is also written 
out for me along with others, although the prophet 
speaks [Ps. 19:5]: "Into all the earth" 2c. This is also 
how one usually speaks when one sends a 
messenger: | sent a messenger to Vienna, whether he 
was still on his way and had not reached the end. So 
| left for my hole, where | have enough mice and stink; 
God grant patience 2c. 

Hereupon, dear friends, all with one another, | want 
you to send my confession to the Christian man 
Philippo Gundelio, to see my responsibility, whether 
any of them have erred, and whether they have no 
been answered by me according to God's word, 
[hoping that he] will report this to me in silence, [and 
that he,] out of Christian love, will not refuse my faithful 
request. But if he does not, he will send it to m 
Christian brother Micheln Stffel gen Tollet, Wolfgang 
Georgerin Caplan, 2) to discuss it, to give me furthe 
help, advice of the writings on all my articles in a small 
summa, so that | am strengthened,

2) Michael Stiefel, Chaplain to Mrs. Dorothea Jorger, the wido 
of the knight Wolfgang Jérger, at Tolleth, which is only about fou 
miles from Scharding. 





and whether | will be touched further, that | will then 
take care to protect myself. | hereby command God. 
Have given me my simple 2c. 


The letter of Mr. Leonhard Kaiser, the 
prisoner of Jesus Christ, written to Michel 
Stifel from prison. March 9, 1527. 


This letter is found in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. 
245, in the other editions at the locations indicated at the 
beginning of this paper. 

Grace and peace from God our Father and the 
Lord Jesus Christ! Rejoice with me, my most beloved 
brother in Christ, that the eternal, almighty God, the 
Father of mercy and God of all comfort, considers me, 
His unworthy servant and great sinner, worthy of a 
blessed profession, that | should confess His holy, 
sweet and blessed name before the wicked world. 
Praised be He for ever and ever, Amen. 

The same God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who has begun his work in me, may he also 
accomplish it, strengthen and direct my heart, all my 
senses, and what | intend to do, in the way of 
salvation; may he also rule my lips, mouth and tongue, 
according to the good pleasure of his fatherly will, that 
they may utter his praise and glory as long as | can 
stir them up, so that through me, his weak, ineffectual 
vessel, his holy, pure and loud gospel, which | have 
heard so often and long, may not be reviled nor 
blasphemed, ah! God wanted, with fruit, to the glory 
and honor of His holy name. 

That | may now be granted this request of mine, 
and that | may obtain it, then sit down earnestly with 
me with your fervent, heartfelt prayer, and let your 
Leonhard Keiser be commanded to you in this. Also, 
diligently admonish your people to pray to our dear 
God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in right faith 
and confidence for me, a poor sinner, according to the 
glorious, comforting promise of Christ: "Where two or 
three are gathered together in my name, there am | in 
the midst of them; and why they ask, it shall not be 
denied them, but shall be done for them of my Father 
which is in heaven." 

Let my Ulrich be commanded to you. Greet the 
honorable and godly woman, Wolfgang Gérgerin, and 
Fuchshuber, the faithful servant of God, and all our 
brothers. The grace of God be with me and with all of 
you, amen. From my prison, on the Saturday before 
Invocavit [March 9] Anno 1527. 

On August 16 of the same year he was burned to death in 
constant confession of Christ and his holy word, as can be seen 
in the following history.

Another writing by Ern Leonhard Kaiser 
[to an unnamed person] written in prison 
before Aug. 16, 1527, 

thus saying: 

Grace and peace through Christ! | am in no doubt 
that you have heard my confession in response to the 
questions posed by Official and Rosin in the presence 
of 1) Notarii Hugl, in a similar [letter]. [I] consider it, as 
much as | know, [that it] should be so uniformly written 
[by me] in the pen, without which the question article 
would have fallen off me, there would be some doubts. 
Because you now see my simple responsibility, 2) | 
am undoubted, you will find out for yourselves by 
God's word (given to you by His word and His Spirit) 
whether divine truth should have been admitted in my 
responsibility, too little, or more than known. 

Therefore, to you, as lovers of divine truth, who let 
me examine the ends and quietly receive an answer, 
to pacify my conscience, and also, with the help and 
comfort of divine scriptures, not to refrain from making 
an effort on my responsibility, if necessary, as | have 
to be careful to protect myself from the wolves and 
enemies, to lay God's word, and to have reason and 
scripture to answer for their unrhymed sayings and 
sayings with [the] hair pulled to it. For this reason, | 
now also need much to expose and to read over, 
especially the booklet of the Babylonian prison,°) in 
which D. Martinus instituted [teaches] two sacraments 
of Christ, pushing the others to the ground. 

Now, dear God, | feel as if | had dreamed of it in my 
sleep, as | had read it at one time, but the reason and 
cause have mostly slipped my mind. Therefore, for my 
benefit, | would like to have the treatise put together, 
or else, because | want to be uncertain and careful 
when dealing with these books, | would like to have 
some sayings of such reproach 4) put into a summa; 
[it] will concern little or not much writing or writings, 
because on the others it would truly be my duty to 
overlook much. 

Almighty GOD, give grace, do not let your holy 
divine Word perish. The Word is 


1) That is: present. 

2) According to this, it seems that the above-mentioned Philip 
Gundelius is the unnamed recipient of this letter. Compare Col. 
952.

babylonischen Gefangenschaft". 





thine, handle thy word; thou must do it! | am far too 
simple and too weak for him, nor do | find it in all my 
power to accomplish anything, to receive your word, 
honor and praise, unless you first give and grant it to 
me; | am nothing but a poor instrument. 

Therefore, dear friends and all my dearest kind 
benefactors, be mindful that | am helped in these 
matters, that my confession is inspected by those who 
may give me helpful and quiet comfort in turn. | am 
now lacking several little books, which | need to 
discuss several points. Item, of the booklets one of 
which | have now brought out, one can be found with 
the N., as he himself indicates. Item, a Latin Psalter, 
covered with white leather, has the N., [of which] | 
would need to comfort myself with a Psalm at times. 
Item, a written Christianism 5) has also seen the N. 
well, also read in the upper room in my presence; | 
would also like to overlook one. 

Item, if Ulrich is not yet native, but still at Tollet, my 
suggestion and good opinion would be that he stick to 
the boys and teach them as before; [I] do not think 
that one should follow him. Item, | have not been 
approached because of him. | have not been asked 
whether | have Lutheran books or not. [Nor did | like it 
that he gave flight. What do they want to do to him? 
He is a free and unmarried man, therefore no one is 
disgusted or annoyed by him. That he be given all 
necessities is my wish. | also ask him to write only 
once in a friendly manner, and also to remind Mr. 
Michael in Tollet to write to me, especially if the 
articles and my responsibility should be delivered to 
him. Greetings to the wife 6) together with all her 
loved ones, [they] have commanded me in their 
prayers, the same, God willing, | will do again. Dear 
friend, let all things be commanded, God help me, that 
| have good hope, | will keep it unforgotten all my life 
2c. 

Among others, two questions come to my mind. 
The first: whether all Christians are priests? Answer: 
Yes, from the saying 1 Petr. 2, 9: "You are a chosen 
generation, a royal priesthood" 2c., because one can 
or may pray for the other and carry his matter before 
God. 


5) In addition, the Jena edition brings as a marginal gloss: 
"Catechism". 

6) In the editions: "Frawen", which is probably not to be fast 
as plural, but it will be the Mrs. Dorothea Jérger to understand 
under it. 


956 


To prove counsel and help through God's word. Also, 
all men who are Christians are kings, that is, lords 
over all the goods of Christ; for all the goods that are 
Christ's, the same goods are also at the same time all 
Christian men, and are all partakers of the same with 
Him through faith, that through Him they are lords 
over sin, death, the devil, and hell; these [have] no 
more to rule nor to command against a Christian 2c. 

Item, secondly: what do | think of the laying on of 
hands? Answer: It would be a common custom of the 
Jews, if they wanted to signify a person worthy of 
honor and dignity, that they then used to signify such 
persons, who were worthy of an office or suitable for 
it, with the laying on of hands. | did not respond 
formally, as | later thought. Now, however, because it 
is not formally asked and not quite clearly, as | also 
encounter much in other matters, it must immediately 
pass away, and at the same time go with other 
heretical articles, as they then condemn me. Where 
one remains, the others also remain 2c. 

End of his handwriting. 


1) Item, between and in the time his friends have 
made a great and high effort for the prisoner's 
release, with a great offer, request and desire, and 
supplication, also many lords have raised to ask and 
prescribe for the prisoner, namely the von Traun, 2) 
the counts of Schaunburg, the von Schwarzenburg, 
margrave Casimirus, the von Starheilberg and other 
many of the nobility, and a diligent interpellation from 
the prince and duke Johansen of Saxony, to which, 
however, he gave no answer 2c. Also, with much offer 
of friendship, he sometimes asked the prince to send 
the prisoner's friendship crimes and misdeeds in 
writing, or to let the friendship remain with him, so that 
they might the more nobly expel him from what he had 
done wrong. But all this and more, everything was 
refused, and nothing helped at all. 2c. 

After this and all the other actions, a legal day was 
set for him on the 11th day of the month of July. But 
he, the bishop, only let the friendship know this on the 
10th day of the hay month before, after noon. The

martyrdom sent to Luther by Michael Stiefel, which Luther 
mentions in his letters to Stiefel on October 8 and 22, 1527.

957 


The prince pretended that he had allowed friendship 
to go up to the prisoner in one part by special grace, 
and to cleanse him of his wrongdoing. But the 
friendship of one part went up to the castle, namely 
those: Friedrich Baumeister, Hans Reichenberger, 
Hans Schmid Kramer, the brothers-in-law; Erasmus 
Keiser his cousin, Thomas Keiser his brother, and 
Hans Greiner, Baumeister's servant, and Master 
Vincenz as procurator. 

So the friendship with him was left in the presence 
of Doctor Eck of Ingolstadt and the Abbot of 
Allersbach, so that nothing secret would be said or 
done 2c. After this [Eck] has a long sermon and along 
speech, ordered him by the prince, how his F. G. out 
of special grace has granted the friendship to Mr. 
Leonhard, also allowed him a procurator, not by right, 
but out of grace and inclination 2c. 

And on the friendship's manifold requests Eck 
wanted to read the articles to Mr. Leonhard, Mr. 
Leonhard raised and said: it would be necessary for 
him to do a preface, because he was weak, pressed, 
therefore he was clumsy 2c. But that would still be the 
opinion: it would be knowing how they dealt with him, 
let him lie for ten weeks before they asked him what 
he had done wrong 2c., then hurriedly touched him, 
and he as a weak man would have to answer many 
and large articles; after which he would be put in 
prison again, then pulled out again unawares, in 
again, out again, he himself would not know how. And 
in such acase he would have answered, but he would 
not know how all his responsibilities were put 
together. According to what he overhastily or 
according to divine word did not decide, he wanted to 
have reserved for him to change such, therefore he 
had long desired to send him his responsibility. 

After such Doctor Eck began to read out his 
[Emperor's] articles and proceedings, namely the 
[following], but what his responsibility was on it, would 
now be too long, but almost on the opinion, as 
reported above in his handwriting, understood 2c. In 
the shortest possible way the articles were read out 
once, that he then confessed everything as it was 
prescribed 2c. 

1. Faith alone justifies before God, without works. 

2. he holds two sacraments, baptism, body and 
blood of Christ. 

The mass is not a sacrifice, useless to the living 
and the dead. 

4. he did not say mass in two years. 


958 


5. he took the sacrament at Wittenberg in two 
forms. 

6. the gospel [is] not preached properly in 
German lands. 

7. penance [is] not a sacrament. 

The Scriptures do not satisfy him about the five 
sacraments. 

9. ear confession [is] not commanded, only a 
counsel. 

10. Christ alone is the satisfaction for sin. 

Marriage is not a sacrament. 

12. praising chastity does not bind. 

13. clanship is to be kept according to the 
Scriptures. 

14. no cause to divorce, because of adultery. 

15 Confirmation and Holy Communion are not 
sacraments. 

16. he did not have scripture from purgatory. 

The good works here do not help the dead there. 

18. All days [are] equal before God. 

19. the dead saints [are] not intercessors. 

20. through Christ [are] the Christians free. 

21 Man has no free will in divine matters. 

In the reading and disputation of such articles, 
Doctor Eck spoke many unseemly words. Mr. 
Leonhard brought writing, but Eck tinkered with a 
mallet 2c. He brought little goods, as he is a heavy 
merchant. After this, the friendship had its procurator 
say that the action was difficult for the layman to 
understand 2c. Therefore, Mr. Leonhard requested 
the day that is now set for the right, even for her, the 
friendship, to hurry. Therefore their request to extend 
the day to a month, also that the friendship may assist 
him, and also to allow Mr. Leonhard a procurator to 
the right, who has a free safe conduct from and back 
to his custody, to communicate clauses and articles 
according to his need 2c. 

Also, Mr. Leonhard should be sent a copy of half 
of his articles, the same of friendship, so that one may 
deliberate or let others of the realm judge about it 2c. 
Also that Mr. Leonhard be allowed one or two who 
please him to speak of the articles in the dungeon. 
Also, if the prince is in trouble, if he receives a 
postponement of the day of justice, the friendship will 
extend such trouble and reimburse it with its money. 

Said Eck and the Abbot of Allersbach, they have 
no power. Therefore, the friendship of the two 
deputies, now reported, diligently requested that they 
be

959 


So let them be good-willed and make an effort to 
request the prince, and indicate such their request, 
desire and approval of friendship 2c. 

When this happened, friendship was required 
before the princes and prelates, as they sat 
afterwards in the morning at the shrine, where Mr. 
Leonhard had been desecrated, and there the officials 
began a long speech, and our request, as mentioned 
above, was denied from piece to piece, and all of them 
were rejected, without only that the writings and 
articles should be delivered to Mr. Leonhard in the 
dungeon today (today). But this was not done, as it 
would have to be proven with his prelates that they did 
not have the writings delivered to him, as we learned 
from Mr. Leonhard himself this morning. The prince 
let speak through the official: he put it home to the 
friends, whether it is honest [that one should do] some 
assistance to such a one as Mr. Leonhard 2c. 

In the morning he was bound and captured with 
great splendor. The prince demanded much from the 
country, with armed hand in the armor almost 
cleaned, which then the prince lent. So they brought 
him and another priest with him, who was an evil-doer, 
who spoke strange words. He confessed the 
innocence of Leonhard; he, the priest, said: "| am not 
worthy to walk beside you; you are a righteous man, | 
am well to blame for death, | shall have my due. [He 
scolded the prince, calling him a bloodhound; he 
talked a lot and shouted loudly; Leonhard punished 
him, telling him to keep quiet. So the two were led 
bound together. First in front of his mother's house, 
the master builder. [He took a heartfelt leave from her 
and comforted her, and she had to kiss him or kill him. 
This was done in order to frighten his friends. In the 
middle of the market, his friends came to him and 
comforted him, for there was no one among them who 
would have wanted him to step away from the truth. 

So the two were led into the chapter house on the 
Pfaffenhof, where the wardrobe was possessed under 
heaven. The citizens of Passau also ordered some of 
their citizens and sons of citizens to wear armor by 
order of the prince. There the bishop of Passau sat in 
his own person as a judge; the suffragan bishop of 
Regensburg, the suffragan bishop of Passau, the 
abbot of Allersbach, provost of Suben, provost of 
Osterhofen, provost of St. Nicolai near Passau, 
provost of St. Salvator, Doctor Eck of Ingolstadt, 
Magister Antonius, dean of Ingolstadt, Doctor Ludwig 
Frésche, cathedral prince, Doctor Tho

mas Ramelsbach, preacher and canon, Johannes 
Schénburger von Schénburg, canon, Hieronymus 
Metting, doctor and official, three notarii: Erasmus 
Kolb, Nicolaus Hugenreuter, Wolfgangus Krieger. 
Item, Master Hans Teberesch as a notary of the 
prison, who has announced and signed the summons, 
Master Christoffel Kirchbuler, Fiscalis 2c. First of all, it 
should be noted that this act, which they have spoken, 
is spoken in Latin, but Mr. Leonhard almost stopped: 
one should speak German; but it would not be. 


Beginning of the act. 


If the official started and spoke to the one from 
Passau, how a captured Lutheran priest was present, 
that one led him into the barns; the lord of Passau 
gave an accessory to bring forward 2c. Then Mr. 
Leonhard was brought forward, the official released 
him from the bonds. After that, the official spoke 
publicly to all the world how the lord of Passau must 
do so out of obligation of his oath to the See of Rome, 
and other things 2c. so that the heretical sect would 
be eradicated. [The named official has also promised 
Mr. Leonhard that if he wants to revoke, then Passau 
will show him mercy. Mr. Leonhard answered through 
his procurator, who was admitted to him by grace 
alone and not by justice, that he could not and might 
not revoke anything that was founded in Scripture; but 
what was not founded should now be contradicted. 

After that, the fiscal came forth, and pulled out a 
large citation, credenced it, and gave it to a notary to 
read out publicly; the notary wept over it. Another 
came forward, read it out with great pleasure. [Mr. 
Leonhard has shown himself humbly on the claim 2c. 
After that the Fiscalis was there, and pulled out a large 
libell, several leaves written in Latin, read out in Latin. 
Mr. Leonhard requested that it be read in German fo 
the sake of the bystanders; but he was not grante 
this. 

So now the libell has been read out in th 
community with all points, namely of the bull of Leoni 
of the pope, of the edict of Worms, also th 
Regensburg statute, and that Mr. Leonhard wa 
prescribed a time, so [he] was first imprisoned, unde 
oath, to express himself of such doctrine, and [he had] 
not kept this. Mr. Leonhard's procurator has made 
number of preliminary statements, and has also mad 
and reproached a protective plea, namely, to set tim 
for a copy of the complaint, 





1) and to consult with impartial persons in the whole 
realm, to ask his friends for instruction; [it] is not to be 
hurried in this trade, because it touches the 
consciences 2c. 

But that none is admitted, but only away the Fiscal 
has stopped that Mr. Leonhard shall personally 
answer from article to article and the complaint: Yes 
or no. [More [of] Mr. Leonhard's procurator has 
requested that one speak German; [it] has not been 
granted, however, but the articles have been read in 
Latin. But Mr. Leonhard gave the summa of the 
articles and his answer in German, with great spirit 
and understanding; much writing fell to him, because 
of which he was courageous, would not have been 
senseless the whole day. 

But the official talks to him a lot, of the opinion: Mr. 
Leonhard, how do you do, do you want to preach? 2c. 
So he confessed the truth before God and men, with 
much compassion of the circumstance. The article, 
now read out, is just the opinion, as | mentioned 
before, since the friendship has been on the castle; 
this time it is not necessary to indicate more. His 
responsibility is placed on the opinion, as evidenced 
by his handwriting 2c. 

After Mr. Leonhard had answered the articles, his 
procurator repeated the due exceptions, but could not 
obtain anything, but to the final judgment a common 
resolution of the matter has been passed, with 
deduction of further submissions. 

Then the one from Passau read a verdict in his own 
person from a note and gave to degrade Mr. Leonhard 
and to answer secular supremacy about. [Mr. 
Leonhard made a speech to mitigate the prince, but 
had no standing; also his procurator repeated and 
protested his necessity, and besides appealed to a 
free concilio, because such action had been heard in 
the whole realm and had not yet been carried out, 2) 
but no admission had been made 2c., 3) consecrated 
garments were put on Mr. Leonhard and taken off 
again by the suffragan bishop of Passau with special 
gestures and collections, from the highest to the 
lowest. He was clothed in a gown, put on a black cut 
beret, and handed over to the city judge as a layman. 
And before that [the] bishop of Passau and the bishop 
of Regensburg have requested for the said emperor 
that

In such a state the henchmen rode before the 
office, and the two executioners and their servant went 
into the office. The executioner asked: What is your 
name? Answer: My name is Leonhard. The 
executioner said: "| can't tell you much nor teach you

made his speech in the ring thus: to all those who had 
brought him hence he forgave them from the heart, 
therefore God would also forgive him. [He] exhorted 
the people to help him diligently for all his adversaries. 
He also asked, if he offended a man with his life or 
example, as he did not preach rightly before 3), to 
forgive him, and to pray for him, that he die in a firm 
Christian faith; and prayed for those who were not yet 
enlightened.

The judge would not let him speak, and said to the 
executioner, "Finish, you know what you are ordered 
to do. So Mr. Leonhard was quick with his 
undressing, and soon he went up to the pyre in his 
vestments, 1) in his shirt, and lay down in a groove of 
the pyre; then he was bound long on the pyre. Then 
he asked (because he was bound) the people to sing: 
Come, Holy Spirit. A papal priest, whom we had put 
away before, was with him again and told him that if 
he had erred in any article, he should ask God for 
mercy. Mr. Leonhard gave no answer, but the priest 
asked Mr. Leonhard if he wanted to die as a devout 
Christian. Answer: Yes; and the priest admonished 
him of baptism and gave the heretic the suffering of 
Christ; it was strange to me 2c. But the same priest 
said afterwards, | do not know what else he said, if 
one had spoken rightly to him, that he had converted; 
and such words 2c. 

In it the fire was lit; in it he made several loud cries: 
Jesus, | am yours, make me blessed! After this, his 
hands and feet and head were burned off. When the 
fire was extinguished, the executioner took a stick, 
rolled out the body, and then put more wood on the 
fire. After that, the executioner hewed a hole in the 
body, pierced it with a sword, then stuck a rod into it, 
and again he burned with the rod on the grate; thus 
burned 2c. 

After that the executioner said to the judge: 
whether he has been judged rightly, as his Lord's 
command? and did not ask how right and judgment 
is given. So Leonhardus ended his life according to 
the word of the Lord, his spirit and sacrificed himself 
on the 16th day of August, on the day of Rochus, 
between 8 and 9, to strengthen him and all Christian 
people in the Lord Jesus Christ. May God grant this 
to all people, Amen.

writings, written from prison to one of his 
friends. 

Grace through Christ. 

Friendly dear N.! Since | have heard of your 
presence, | have been greatly pleased in my heart, 
and if you were all well in spiritual and temporal gifts 
from God, | would not hear anything better. 


1) By "kélblin" is probably to be understood the above- 
mentioned "cut beret". 


Letters from the year 1527. no. 1086. 


965 


Dear N., you know my accident on account of the 
old Adam, who is tormented in the cave 2) and is very 
disgusted with him, and often rises up in impatience 
to grumble against God, as if great injustice were 
being done to him; yet the spirit is present (although 
weak), and comforts him again. Oh how poor and 
feeble he is, | complain to God and to you, my dear 
N. Ask God for me that he may be strengthened. 

| heard the other day from the faithful brother in 
Christ, N., that you have a sweet and kind heart 
towards me, and that | rejoiced greatly in my heart 
that God had given me such a friend, who might also 
put himself in danger of death for my sake. Now, 
dearest N., you are well aware that my life is in 
danger of death, yet in the hand of God. For, as | have 
been told by the pious N. and others who have visited 
me in silence, the prince will, if | do not renounce 
heresy and convert, [put me] on trial, and let happen 
to me what the law gives. O God from the heaven of 
justice, look into it, save and defend your word, save 
me, your poor instrument, from these bloodthirsty 
dogs and enemies of those who confess God's word. 

| have decided with myself, as Paul says Rom. 8, 
38. f., that neither death nor life, neither angel nor 
power shall turn me away from the love of God and 
His holy word: but there are twelve hours in the day, 
and it is not up to anyone to will or to run, but up to 
God's mercy, as he says Cap. 9,16. Therefore it is 
pure grace if | remain steadfast, and not at all up to 
my own doing; whether a man stands or falls, he 
stands or falls by God 2c. 

Therefore, dear N., | am truly too foolish and 
childish for your suggestion and friendly Christian 
offer, and do not know what to leave or do in this 
case. You should therefore ask the Christian N. 
brother what should or should not be done in this 
matter. | will also let it happen that you make an effort 
and work diligentlY on my behalf, but | will 
nevertheless, above all things, place my cause in the 
hands of God. He has thrown me into the hole, even 
though the old Adam often strives against it and says: 
You would have been idle in this misfortune, you 
have been warned often enough, you should beware 
2c. But because Christ Matth. 10, 29. [says]: "Does 
one not buy two sparrows for a penny?" and [v. 30.]: 
"The hairs of your heads are all 


2) "hole" == hole, prison. With Walch: "hell". 


966 


and none shall fall from the head without the will of 
your Father," Adam must ever stand still here and say 
that it is God's will, Isa. 2." Why does man murmur 
against me, saying that neither good nor evil comes 
from God? 

If the bishop now pursues the matter against me 
with his dogs, the enemies of the divine word, | 
believe that he will deal with me abruptly, as he did 
with Oberhaimer, although | believe that he will soon 
end it with me. Let it now be as the merciful God wills, 
but he must have his will and his eyes open, otherwise 
he will not be able to do anything with me. Since 
everything is in his power, we want to put the matter 
in his hands and command him, request and ask of 
him that his holy name not be reviled by me, but that 
his will, and not mine, be done for me. Nevertheless, 
we do not want to omit good means and counsel, 
considered with God's will, but rather cultivate them, 
and yet we want to give God the prosperity and the 
honor. 

Dear N., | can well consider that | have completely 
outraged and angered the devil, the spiritual holy 
people; in that | have placed the question articles and 
my responsibility in the kingdom to examine, and do 
not wait with them. Which the prince also heard, since 
| spoke such words and others with the priest, and he 
himself had me examined by the priest for this reason. 
Because | have now offered, at my cost, through the 
travels of my friends, brothers-in-law and brothers, 
that | would gladly turn away from impartial people, 
where | have answered unformally, and be guided by 
well-founded writing, should not D. Ramelsbach jump 
before Grimmen, where he heard such contempt? 
The like also the others, Doctor Rosin, Official, 
Fréschel, Perger and the same bunch? Well, the boy 
must die, their hearts will be against the poor sheep. 
But God is above them and mocks them in their 
accusations and says: "You do not have to do 
anything to him, | want you to. Oh, if my heart were 
firm and could believe that this is so, how blessed | 
would close my days in this way. 

| also believe, dear N., that the bishop already had 
my responsibility at Ingolstadt, and had the enemies 
of God examine it. If this is true, then | have already 
lost, and may God have mercy on me and save me 
from their judgment. Oh, dear God, how might or 
could the race

but act more cruelly than it does! If one does not 
answer, they stretch and stretch him, 2) as they did to 
the one in the Free City who recanted on Palm Day. 
Item, now they let a priest throw his corpse out of the 
church in Weidhofen, because he took his cook in 
marriage in secret, and made a will on his death for 
her benefit, and dressed her as his wife before God. 
But a whore would be well off if she inherited all the 
goods of her whore husband, and the friends would 
not receive a penny 2c. 

Thus, dear N., the holy generation acts. May God 
have mercy on those who do so out of ignorance, but 
God has blinded them like Pharaoh. 

Oh, my dear N., be well, all of you; comfort my dear 
mother, my brothers-in-law, my friends and my 
brothers, that they command God to do this and other 
things that are unpleasant for them. God wants to try 
us, who will grant us patience and constancy in all 
troubles and distresses. 

| also take great care of the boys and Ulrich, who 
are now also orphaned and abandoned. | do not know 
3) whether Ulrich has food or not; that he be given 
food. | would like them to be brotherly with each other 
and not forget Ulrich, as | have often ordered them. 

Item, if something is sent to me from Wittenberg, 
decree that it be delivered to me in [silence]. 

Greet your pious housewife, if you come to her with 
joy, that | have good hope. 

Be at peace with your brothers-in-law and sister-in- 
law and with everyone. 

Oh, think how this is a rich, great treasure, for 
which one can never thank God enough when a 
person is free and not imprisoned. But we do not 
remember these and other gifts of God before we feel 
and sense the contradiction. 

Let my cause be commanded to you in the best 
and according to God's will; do not deal with it 
carelessly or unadvisedly. 

May God Almighty grant all of you, my dear 
brothers and sisters, His knowledge to proceed in this 
and other things according to His divine will. God be 
with us all, amen.

To the worthy and dear brother in Christ, the faithful 
and dear servant and prisoner of Christ, Leonhard 
Keisek. 

Grace, strength and peace in Christ! That your old 
man, dear Leonhard, was caught, is the will and calling 
of Christ your Savior, who also gave his new man for you 
and your sin into the hands of the ungodly, so that he 
redeemed you with his blood as a brother and co-heir of 
eternal life. 

We are sorry for you, and we also pray diligently that 
you may be set free, not for your own sake, but that you 
may be useful to many for the glory of God, if it is His will. 
But if it be the will in heaven that thou shouldest not be 
made free, yet thou art free in spirit. Only see that you 
are strong and constantly overcome the weakness of the 
flesh, or even patiently bear it through the power of 
Christ. He who is with you in prison will also be with you 
in all distress, as he so faithfully and kindly promises in 
Ps 91:15: "I am with him in distress" 2c. 

Therefore it is necessary that you cry out to him in 
prayer with all your confidence, and with psalms of 
comfort refresh and sustain yourself in this fierce anger 
of Satan, so that you may be strengthened in the Lord 
and not speak too little or too softly to the teeth of 
Behemoth, as if you had overcome and feared his 
arrogance. Faithfully call upon Christ, who is everywhere 
present and powerful, then defy Satan and mock his rage 
and arrogance, for you are sure that he cannot harm you, 
and so much the less, so much the more he rages. St. 
Paul says Rom. 8, 31: "If God is for us, who can be 
against us?" Ps. 8, 7: "All things are put under His feet." 
He can and will help all who are challenged, "who also 
has been tempted in every way" [Heb. 4:15]. 

So, my dearest brothers, strengthen yourself in the 
Lord and be confident in his mighty power, so that you 
may recognize, support, love and praise the fatherly will 
of God out of a good heart, whether you become free or 
not. But that you may be able to do this in honor of his 
holy gospel, may the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ 
work in you according to the riches of his glorious grace, 
which is a 





Father is of mercy and a God of all comfort, amen. In this 
you will have mercy, and also pray for us. Given at 
Wittenberg, on Monday after Cantate [May 20] in the year 
1527. Martin Luther. ? 


Martinus Luther. 


So far | have let this legend and story go without my 
word, as | have obtained it from many honest writings and 
especially from Mr. Lenhard's own manuscripts, so that 
no one can say that we have been telling lies. For my 
own handwriting, 2) which | sent to him in prison, has 
come back to me together with his handwriting, broken 
and read, that this is my testimony certainly and truly 
enough. Therefore | kindly ask all pious Christians to 
thank and praise God through Jesus Christ, who gives us 
such comfort through his dear servant and martyr 
Lenhard. Oh Lord God, that | had been or would still be 
worthy of such confession and death! What am |? What 
do | do? How ashamed | am, when | read this story, that 
| have not long since been worthy of suffering the same 
(although ten times more deserving before the world). 
Well, my God, should it be so, so be it, your will be done! 


But | want to warn you tyrants and angry papists 
faithfully and ask you to be careful, for your own good, 
and if you do not want to believe with us, that you do not 
so wretchedly condemn yourselves in innocent blood’. 
You see and hear that God nevertheless attacks your 
one part even now (which | will not name). The pope, 
your idol, is almost leading with half a cart, and has lost 
his common prayer; see, God warns you manifoldly and 
calls you to repentance. And even if you rage, our 
doctrine is the gospel, as you yourselves know, that we 
preach Christ the Savior, thus praising worldly authority 
and restoring it to its right and honor, as it was not before. 
For you yourselves know that until now worldly rulers 
have been

Papists is almost trampled underfoot. What are you 
raging about? Why do you shed innocent blood without 
any cause or need, when we serve you with our doctrine 
for soul, body and good in the highest and most diligent 
way? 

If you want to be angry and fight unbelief, dear, do it! 
You have the Turk. You should try it cheaper, if you would 
be willing to control unbelief, although | don't rush anyone 
to get it. But if you want to fight, and the knife is so loose, 
or the skin itches, then | would be satisfied that you go for 
those who can win honor and prize, and prove their 
manhood and armor, and not for the wretched innocents 
who live among us in peace and quiet, and serve us to 
the highest degree, especially with teachings. They are 
ugly, hostile animals, which strangle themselves among 
themselves, as wolves do when they have a wedding and 
a bridal run. But it is much more hostile when one 
member eats and corrupts the other, as we are 
unfortunately doing now. 

And even if you want to be stubborn, you will gain 
nothing but greater condemnation. It is God's word that 
will remain, as Isaiah [Cap. 40:8] and Peter [1 Ep. 1:25] 
say. And we also will remain, all those who cling to it and 
believe, even though we must fail and go into the sleep 
of death. You yourselves could not deny that it is written 
in the Scriptures as we teach, but that it is not written in 
your decrees and in the doctrines of men. But what can 
we do about it? Our scripture is confirmed by heaven, 
your decree has not yet done any miracles, nor is it 
confirmed by heaven. Oh Lord God, it is an unequal fight 
when the old pots want to fight with the rocks, for it goes 
over the pots as it will: if they fall on the rocks, they bump 
into each other and break; but if the rocks fall on them, 
they smash and crush the pots, so that it would be 
advisable for the pots to remain pots as they are, in the 
kitchen, and not to go out into the field and fight against 
the rocks and mountains. 

Christ himself also says [Matth. 21, 44]: "Whoever 
falls on this stone will be broken, but on whom it falls it 
will be crushed.

S73 


You are an earthly and fragile vessel, like a pot or a jar. 
But, beloved, do not rub against me; let me be the rock, 
and be not sworn with me. If not, verily | say unto you, | 
am a stone, and will not fear that the pots have great 
bellies, and are puffed up, as though they would terrify 
me with their wrath and their dread. The bigger bellies 
they have and the wider they are inflated, the easier they 
break and the better they are to hit. Similarly, | do not 
care that they have wide mouths and holes at the top, 
that they can shout and blaspheme against me as if no 
one could fill them. For this is the least of all things, and 
they are easily broken, so that neither belly nor hole 
remains, but, as Isaiah says [Cap. 30:14], there is 
scarcely a shard left to carry a coal in. 

For so the other psalm also declared [v. 9.], "Thou 
shalt break them as the vessel of a potter." Beware then, 
dear lords, dear friends, dear enemies! For it is serious in 
the sight of God, and we do not begrudge you anything 
bad, but would gladly have you recognize yourselves and 
come to your senses; for we have no pleasure nor joy in 
your damnation, God knows that! would rather have you 
be blessed with us, and gladly forgive from the bottom of 
our hearts all the bloodshed that you practice on us, for 
you do not hinder our cause with it, but only further it the 
more, to yourselves to great horrible destruction. Do not 
fail yourselves, and do not let us offer you peace and 
forgiveness in vain and ask for you; it will truly be smelled 
all too badly in the torment, which (oh Lord God!) has no 
end. 

When | was at Worms before the emperor, | gave this 
advice to the bishop of Trier: one should leave these 
things to God, because they concern the soul, and [it] 
would not be too close to anyone's body and goods. If it 
were of men, it would soon perish; if it were of God, no 
one could dampen it; which counsel Gamaliel also gave 
to the Jews. And such advice is not mine, but of the Holy 
Spirit, who has confirmed it through St. Lucas, Apost. 
5,38. f. But it would not sound. Well, as it also worked 
afterwards and still works, ask the whole of German

give him a good report to his relatives through this

married here, and in a lawful manner, that nun (if she was 
otherwise a nun) Dorothea, who afterwards left him as a 
whore and secretly fled from here, taking all his goods 
and money with her. The mother of this whore knew about 
this infamy and the escape and participated in it. She 
stayed here for a while and, under a splendid pretense of 
godliness, played a deception on all of us and presented 
the daughter as recommendable, even worthy of this 
marriage. Therefore, let his relatives refrain from taking 
offense; through no fault of his, he suffers this dishonor 
and damage as well as we this exceedingly great and 
frightening annoyance. God will repay the harlot mother 
and the harlot what they deserve, since they abuse the 
favor shown to them because of the Gospel to their deceit 
and wickedness, to the shame of all of us. This is true;

To the highly esteemed man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 
Christ's servant at Altenburg, his brother who is 
exceedingly dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! It is written and said 
here that you are suffering from illness, my dear Spalatin. 
If this is so, | beseech the Lord Jesus that he may restore 
thee and keep thee by his divine power in honor of his 
word. In the meantime, patiently bear his gracious hand, 
as you have been taught, not only to know it, but also to 
teach it to others. For the Lord will make an end of 
temptation [1 Cor. 10:13]. Three days ago | also had a 
sudden attack of fainting and was seized by it so much 
that | despaired completely and thought | would die under 
the hands of my wife and friends, so much was | suddenly 
deprived of all strength. But the Lord had mercy on me 
and restored me quickly. Therefore pray for me, | 
beseech thee; beseech the Lord that he will not forsake 
his sinner. Be well in the Lord. There is a rumor that the 
plague is with us, but it is unfounded and false; by Christ's 


grace all is well and quiet. July 10, 1527. 
Yours, Martin Luther.

To the venerable Johann Bugenhagen Pommer, 
our pastor, dearest friend and brother in the 
Lord. 

It seems to me that this quick weakness of our dear 
father D. Martini and other cases that have occurred 
are warnings by which God reminds us that we should 
not heap wrath upon ourselves, Rom. 2, 5. For this 
reason | have taken the serious speeches that the 
doctor spoke out of a fervent heart yesterday in his 


said that it was much harder and more dangerous than 
the painful weakness that had struck him on the same 
aturday evening at five o'clock (which was so quick 
that we were afraid he would stay over it), although he 
let himself be heard the Sunday after that the same 
physical weakness was not natural, but perhaps such 
suffering as St. Paul suffered from Satan, who beat him 
with his fists 2c, 2 Cor. 12, 7. For he said that his 
weakness and suffering had first begun in his left ear 
and had not affected him in any other way, but as if it 
roared with great impetuosity in front of his left ear and 
the whole of his left cheek like rushing waves of the 
sea, but not yet inwardly of the head, but outwardly. 
Such (he said to D. Jonah, who was alone with him

would soon have to die, because the same whirring and 
roaring (like a strong wind), which he felt before (as 
said) only in front of his ear, would now have taken over 
his left ear inside and half of the main part. 

Since I, D. Pomeranus, have begun to talk about 
this, | will first tell the story of the physical illness that 
struck him after noon. Suddenly he sank into such a 
deep unconsciousness that he knew nothing about 
himself, and his body became absolutely so cold that 
no color, no blood, no feeling, no voice, no sign of life, 
but only death could be seen and noticed in him. But 
when he was watered with fresh water, as he cried out 
to Jonah when he felt the faintness, he began to come 
to himself again, began to pray with great earnestness 
from a fervent heart, as Jonah, our dearest brother, has 
diligently recorded. 

But I, who did not know at the time what the doctor's 
situation was, was called to him at six o'clock in the

This honor did not happen to St. John the Evangelist 
either, who wrote a much worse book (he needed 
such words) against the Pabstacy (which is the realm 
of the true Antichrist, who soon began to practice his 
craft in Paradise, as the Scripture says: "You will stab 
him in the heels"), the like of which | will never write 
nor can. 

But when | was standing before him, very 
frightened by the fear of my heart, | spoke to him 
kindly like this: Dear Doctor, pray with us that you may 
stay longer with us, to comfort us wretched and many 
others. He answered: "For my own sake, dying would 
be my gain, but living longer in the flesh would be 
necessary for the sake of many. Dear God, your will 
be done! 

After that he turned to me and D. Jonah and said: 
"Because the world delights and delights in lying, 
many will say that | have revoked my teaching before 
my end, therefore | earnestly desire that you be 
witnesses of my confession of faith. | say with a clear 
conscience that | have taught rightly from God's Word, 
according to God's command, to which He has drawn 
and urged me even without my will. Yes, | say, | have 
taught rightly and wholesomely about faith, love, the 
cross, the sacraments and other articles of Christian 
doctrine. 

Many blame me for being too harsh and vehement 
when | write against the papists and red spirits 2c. and 
punish their false doctrine, ungodly nature and 
hypocrisy. Yes, | have been fierce at times and have 
attacked my adversaries harshly, but in such a way 
that | have never repented. Whether | have been 
fierce or moderate, | have sought no one's harm, 
much less his soul's loss, but rather everyone's best 
and happiness, even that of my enemies. | had 
intended to act and write about the holy baptism of 
Christ, also against Zwingel and other sacrament 
enthusiasts, but as it can be seen, the dear God has 
decided something else about me. 

Then he spoke to us with great earnestness (God 
always included: Ah God 2c.) against the devotees of 
the sacraments, and lamented with tears that now 
many sects and cults had arisen that falsified and 
perverted God's word, and would not spare His army, 
which He had acquired through His blood. He said, 
"To me, the unworthy, God has given many beautiful 
gifts, which he has not given to many thousands of 
other people, who | would like to use longer in his 
honor, and also for the benefit and comfort of the 
godly, if it were his will. But you will be unequal and 
too weak to so many enthusiasts who are now tearing 
down everywhere. But | console myself 


that Christ is stronger than the wretched Satan 
(together with all his scales), yes, he is his Lord. 

The will, however, which he made to his wife, who 
was pregnant, and to his little son, was as follows: My 
dearest God, | thank you from the bottom of my heart 
that you have willed that | should be poor and a 
beggar on earth, and therefore | cannot leave my 
house, my fields, my land, my money or my property 
to my wife and my sons after me; as you have given 
them to me, so | give them to you again, you rich, 
faithful God; feed them, teach them, keep them, as 
you have fed me until now 2c. O Father of the 
fatherless and Judge of widows. D. Jonas has 
diligently distinguished what are more of the 
speeches. 

However, while he was talking like this, Augustine 
1) made every effort to warm up his body, which (as | 
said) was freezing cold, with many cloths, pillows and 
clothes, which were always made warm over a 
charcoal fire and laid out for him, and to bring it back 
into shape, especially his chest and feet. After that, 
we, D. Jonas, D. Augustin Schurs, the physician, and 
I, go down from him into the hall to take supper, as 
much as we can in such suffering and sorrow, so that 
he may rest the better. Meanwhile, however, D. 
Augustin goes up again to see how the sick man is 
doing, comes back and says that the doctor has been 
sweating a lot, and that there is therefore good hope 
that he will have no more trouble this time. Since we 
were thus suspended between hope and fear, we also 
visited our patient, greeted him and wished him a 
blessed night, and went home. 

When we visited him again the following morning, 
it turned out that the doctor had judged correctly, only 
that the sick man was still in bed on Sunday and said 
that he was not yet completely free of the terrible 
roaring and rushing in his head. On the evening of the 
same day, however, he got up, had supper with us, 
and all things, praise and thanks be to Christ, were 
restored. Thus the Lord led into hell and out again, not 
only him, but also us together with him, so that we 
would not put our trust in ourselves. 

Now that | come back to the point | started with: if 
this weakness that struck him after noon was so great 
and dangerous, as we have said so far, the spiritual 
challenge he endured and endured in the morning will 
have been much more severe and horrible, which he 
said had affected him much more severely than the 
bodily weakness after noon, which he himself

indicated that [it] would not have been a natural 
weakness, but a stroke of Satan's neck. 

Now that the same spiritual challenge of Saturday 
morning was over, the pious Job worried that where 
the hand of God would come again so strongly, he 
would not be able to bear it, perhaps he also had a 
concern that it would now be time for our Lord Jesus 
Christ to call him from hence, therefore he sent his 
servant Wolf to me at 8 o'clock before noon, and had 
him tell me that | wanted to come to him in a hurry. 
Since he said "hurriedly", | was a little shocked about 
it, but found the doctor in his usual form standing with 
his housewife, as he could then with a quiet, collected 
mind give everything home to God and command it. 
For he was not in the habit of complaining to people 
who could not help him or to whom he could not be 
useful with his complaints, but he was in the habit of 
standing against people as they desired to have him, 
who sought comfort from him. If he sometimes does 
too much over the table with cheerfulness, he has no 
pleasure in it himself, and this cannot displease any 
godly man, much less annoy him, because he is an 
affable man and is hostile to all mendacity and 
hypocrisy. 

But so that | would continue, | asked the doctor why 
he had summoned me? He answered: "For the sake 
of no evil. When we had gone out and stood aside in 
a special place, he ordered himself and all that he had 
with great earnestness, began to confess and confess 
his sin, and the master desired from the disciple 
comfort from the divine word, item, an absolution and 
release from all his sins; also admonished me that | 
should pray diligently for him, which | likewise desired 
from him. 

Furthermore, he asked me to allow him to receive 
the Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ 
on the following Sunday, because he hoped to preach 
on the same Sunday, was not concerned (as far as | 
could tell) about the accident that happened to him 
after noon, as | said, and yet said: "If the Lord will call 
me now, let his will be done! | was appalled by this 
and other speeches. But when | saw that evening that 
he was so fatally ill, | had no other thought that he 
would die, for | knew how earnestly he had sent 
himself to the end of this life in the morning. 

But this piece, which is well worth knowing, | must 
not forget. Since he had confessed and then talked 
about the spiritual challenge, which he experienced 
the same morning with such terror and

When he felt that he could not talk it out, he continued: 
"Many think, because | am sometimes cheerful in my 
outward conduct, that | am walking on vain roses; but 
God knows how | am for the rest of my life. | have often 
intended to be of service to the world in a more serious 
and holy way (I don't know what to call it), but God has 
not given me this to do. 

The world, in praise of God, finds no vice in me, 
which it could impute to me with truth, nevertheless it 
is annoyed by me. Perhaps God wants to make the 
blind, ungrateful world a fool over me, so that it will be 
corrupted by its contempt and not be worthy of seeing 
the beautiful gifts that He otherwise denies to many 
thousands of people, so that He has graced me to 
serve those whom He knows well, so that, because 
the world does not think highly of the word of salvation 
that God offers it through me, its weak, small vessel, 
it will find in me that it is offended and falls. What God 
means by such His judgment, | return to Him. | pray 
and call upon Him daily with earnestness that He may 
grant me mercy, that through my sin | may not give 
anyone cause to take offense at me. - | have heard 
this from him with great pleasure. 

Since | was acting alone with him, it was almost 
time to have lunch. And because we had been 
summoned by some of the nobility to eat with them, | 
reminded him that he wanted to please the guests and 
not stay outside. But he refused. Then | admonished 
his wife that she wanted him to come and not stay at 
home alone. She hoped it would be good for him to be 
with people and talk to them about all sorts of things. 
2c. 

Then he came to the meal, ate and drank, but very 
little, which | noticed among all at the table alone. 
Nevertheless, as is his way, he was in good spirits with 
the guests, made them happy, as much as he wanted 
to suffer, because he had not yet forgotten what a 
great journey he had been on shortly before. At the 
twelfth hour, however, he got up from the table, went 
into D. Jonas's garden behind his house, and left. 
Jonah's garden behind his house. But I, because | had 
to preach at vespers, went home. 

After this time, everything happened with the 
weakness of D. M., as | have told it above, of which 
everything, neatly written in a document, our dear 
brother D. Jonas has made a good report and sent it 
to me (especially the speeches which he heard from 
D. Martins, partly alone, partly | together with him at 
the same time). For he knew well that he had sent me

It would do me a great favor if he would send it to me 
in writing, so that | could have such speeches before 
my eyes, remember them often, and also have an 
example to follow when | am challenged.

On the Saturday after the Visitation of the Virgin 
Mary, in the evening half an hour before six, Luther's, 
our dear father's, weakness happened as follows: 
Since he had had a severe spiritual challenge that 
same morning, as he himself confessed, and yet had 
fairly come back to himself, and had been asked to be 
a guest by some of the nobility, namely Marx von 
Wallefels, Hans Léser 2c, he went to Paul Schulte's 
inn. After the meal, he went into my garden to beat his 
melancholy and sadness and to refresh himself a bit, 
sat there, talked with me about various things, for two 
hours. When he left my house, he told me and my wife 
that we should dine with him in the evening. When it 
was five o'clock, we went up to the monastery. Then 
the doctor said that he had gone to bed, that he would 
like to rest and recover, because he had come home 
weak, and asked [me], however, that | should not let 
the time be long, and if it would be a little delayed, | 
should put it down to his weakness. 

When | had rested for a while, the doctor got up 
from bed, thinking that he wanted to have supper with 
us, but complained of a large, annoying, unusual 
roaring and ringing in his left ear (which, as doctors 
say, tends to precede fainting). But because this 
ringing and buzzing grew larger and larger, he said 
that he could not stay at the table with us because of 
his weakness, so he went back to his bedroom and 
lay down in bed again. | alone soon followed him on 
foot, | do not know what the doctor ordered the maids 
at the bottom of the stairs before she came (although 
she did not delay long). When he stepped over the 
threshold of the bedchamber, he fainted, and hastily 
said to me: "O Doctor Jonah, | feel sick, bring me 
water or what you have, or | will perish. So | caught

almost frightened and nimbly a pot with cold water; | 
poured it partly under his face, partly in his back, as | 
could. 

Then he began to pray: My dearest God, if you 
want this to be the hour that you have provided for me, 
may your gracious will be done. Further he prayed 
(lifted up his eyes) with great fervor of his heart the 
Lord's Prayer and the sixth Psalm. In this the doctor 
also came up. When she saw that he was so frail and 
almost dead, she was very frightened and called 
loudly to the maids. The doctor then asked that his 
pants be taken off soon. | did so quickly and threw him 
there. As he was lying on his back, he would have 
liked to rest, but he complained that he was very weak 
and felt no more strength. We rubbed and cooled him, 
gave him refreshments and did what we could until the 
doctor came. 

Shortly thereafter he began to pray again and said: 
"Lord, my most beloved God, how gladly | would have 
shed my blood for the sake of your word, you know 
that, but perhaps | am not worth it. Thy will be done! If 
you want it so, | will gladly die, only that your holy 
name may be praised and glorified, be it through my 
life or death. But if it were possible, dear God, | would 
gladly live longer for the sake of your blessed or 
chosen ones. But when the hour has come, do it as 
you please; you are the Lord over life and death. 

My dearest God, you have led me into this matter, 
you know that it is your word and the truth; do not exalt 
nor please your enemies, lest they boast: Where is 
now their God? but declare your holy name contrary 
and to the chagrin of the enemies of your blessed, 
salvific word. 

My dearest Lord Jesus Christ, you have graciously 
given me the knowledge of your holy name, you know 
that | believe in you, together with Father and Holy 
Spirit, one and true God, and comfort me that you are 
our mediator and savior, who shed your precious 
blood for us sinners: stand by me in this hour and 
comfort me with your Holy Spirit. Again he said: "You 
know, Lord, that many of them to whom you have 
given it have shed their blood for the sake of 
confessing your gospel. | hoped that it would also 
come to me that | should also have shed my blood for 
the sake of your holy name, but | am not worthy; your 
will be done! 

You know, Lord, that Satan has stalked me in many 
ways, that he has made me bodily 


994 


by tyrants, kings, princes, 2c., and spiritually by his 
fiery darts and terrible, devilish temptations. But thou 
hast hitherto preserved me marvelously against all 
their raging and raging; preserve me further, thou 
faithful Lord, it is thy will. 

He also remembered the physical doctor and 
asked if D. Augustin would come soon? Yes, we said, 
and he came not long after. He put warm pillows, 
cloths and other things on him, comforted him and 
gave him hope that, God willing, there would be no 
need for this time. In the meantime, D. Pomeranus, 
pastor of the church in Wittenberg, to whom the 
doctor had confessed early that day, arrived. There 
he spoke to us, as he spoke to me, Jonah, and to the 
women who stood before him, when the faintness 
subsided a little: Dear ones, pray diligently for me. We 
again exhorted him that he would earnestly beseech 
the Lord Christ not to take him, the faithful minister of 
his holy word, from us. He answered: "My dear priest, 
| confessed to you today and you gave me absolution, 
which is dear to me. 

But as the faintness increased somewhat, he 
repeated in his prayer comforting words and sayings 
from the Holy Scriptures, which he spoke out of a 
fervent heart and firm faith and certain confidence in 
God's grace and mercy, shown to us in Jesus Christ: 
My most beloved GOD (he said), you are indeed a 
GOD of sinners and wretched people, who feel their 
anguish, distress and misery and heartily desire your 
grace, comfort and help, as you say: "Come to me, all 
you who labor and are burdened, and | will give you 
rest." O Lord, | come in response to your promise; | 
am in great anguish and distress; help me for the sake 
of your grace and faithfulness, amen. 

Not long after that he said to his housewife: "My 
dearest Kathe, | beg you, will our dear God take me 
to Himself this time, so that you may surrender to His 
gracious will. You are my wife, you shall certainly 
keep it and have no doubt about it. Let the blind 
godless world say what it wants against it. If you 
follow God's word and hold fast to it, you will have a 
certain, constant comfort against the devil and all his 
blasphemers. Then he said to Doctor Pommer and to 
me: "| meant that | still wanted to have written about 
holy baptism. Item, against Zwingel and others who 
falsify and pervert the doctrine of the Sacrament, but 
God may not want it; his will be done! 


Letters from the year 1527. No. 1100. 


995 


Soon he began to pray again: O my dear Lord 
Jesus Christ, who said, "Ask, and it shall be given you; 
seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened 
to you," according to this promise of yours, give me, 
O Lord, who ask, not gold nor silver, but a strong, firm 
faith. Let me find, | who seek, not the pleasure or joy 
of the world, but comfort and refreshment through 
your blessed, healing word. Open to me who knock; | 
do not desire anything that the world esteems great 
and high, for | am not a hair's breadth better in your 
sight, but give me your Holy Spirit to enlighten my 
heart, to strengthen and comfort me in my anguish 
and distress, to keep me in right faith and trust in your 
grace until my end, amen. 

He continued: "O my most beloved God and 
Father, you have given me many noble and precious 
gifts before many other thousands; if it were your will, 
| would gladly use them for the praise and glory of 
your holy name, for the benefit and comfort of your 
small army. But your divine, fatherly will be done. Only 
that your name be honored through me, whether | live 
or die, amen. 

Then he further said: "Oh, how will the devotees, 
the sacrament abusers, the Anabaptists and other 
mobs wreak havoc after my death! But | take comfort 
in the fact that Christ is stronger than Satan and all his 
scales; indeed, he is their Lord. When he said this, he 
wept so loudly that tears flowed down his cheeks. 

When warm cloths and pillows were laid on him to 
warm his cold body again, he asked his son: "Where 
is my dearest little girl? When the child was brought, 
it laughed at the father. Then he said, "Oh, you good, 
poor little child! Now, | entrust my dearest Kate and 
you, poor orphan, to my dear, pious, faithful God. You 
have nothing, but God, who is the father of orphans 
and the judge of widows, will feed and provide for you. 
Then he continued talking to his housewife about the 
silver cups. Except for these, he said, you know that 
we have nothing else. 

At this and other speeches of her master, the 
doctor was greatly shocked and saddened, but she 
did not let herself realize that she had suffered so 
much that she should see her dear master lying there 
so miserably before her eyes, but stood confidently 
and said: "My dearest doctor, if it is God's will, | would 
rather have you with our Lord God than with me. It is 
not only for my sake and for the sake of my child, but 


996 


Letters from the year 1527. no. 1100. 1101. 1102. 


997 





but for many pious Christian people who still thirst for 
you. For my sake, my dearest Lord, do not worry; | 
entrust you to his divine will, | hope and trust in God, 
he will graciously preserve you. 

So, while the doctor was rubbed with warm cloths 
and warm potions were placed on his chest and 
around his feet, he said: "I feel, praise God, 
improvement, the fainting subsides and my strength 
returns slowly. If | could only sweat, | hoped that by 
God's grace | would have no further trouble this time.

he could sweat and rest. So we bid him good night and

The next day the doctor said to me: "Jonah, | must 
remember yesterday, it was my turn to go to school 
and | sat in a hot sweat bath. The Lord leads into hell 
and out again. He went on to say that the spiritual trial 
he had endured in the morning would have been much 
greater and more severe than the physical one he 
would have faced in the evening. The Lord, he said, 
kills and makes alive, for he is the Lord of death and 
life. To him be praise, honor and glory forever and 
ever, amen.

To the highly venerable and holy man, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, pastor of the church at Zwickau, his| 
superior in Christ. 

Grace and peace! If this man's case stands as he tells 
it, my dear Nicolaus, | think he is justified in keeping 
this wife, since the former husband has left her for so 
long a time and has made himself 





immediately exposed to all dangers with her. That is 
my opinion. 

The visitation has begun to be fulfilled, because 
eight days ago the Lord Knight 1) and M. Philip left for 
this work. Christ guide them, amen. 

Rome has been miserably devastated with the 
pope, because Christ reigns in such a way that the 
emperor, who persecutes Luther for the pope, is 
forced to destroy the pope for Luther. Namely, 
everything serves Christ for his own and against his 
adversaries. 

Besides, there is nothing new.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! Our councillors have presented us with a 
letter you gave them from Erneiten Randwich, the old 
priest of Belzig (Belzk), who would like to have the 
priest of Rodikaw, who recently resigned; we have 
read it out. Now we don't know how the same priest 
is skilled and experienced in this at the time when the 
divine word is so brightly and apparently coming to 
light. But we request that you hear him (ime) in this; 
where you will then find that he is skilled and fit to 
preside over the common poor people with the 
proclamation of the divine word and_ the 
administration of the sacrament, and then deliver our 
presentation to him and thereby direct him to our 
office in Belzig. If, however, he would not be suitable, 
then you will know how to report this to us, and also 
how to send us the presentation again by chance. In 
your gracious opinion, we do not want to leave this 
unopened. Date Torgau, Monday of St. Mary

Jena 1) or close to it. 

Grace and peace in Christ! This Pole Andrew, my dear 
Philip, who was recommended to us by our friends in 
Breslau, we also want to have recommended to you,

a good man, learned and knowledgeable of many

saved my soul from the depths of hell [Ps. 86:13]. You 
also do not cease to pray for me, just as | do for you. But 
| believe that my struggle concerns others as well. We 
are convinced that the plague is here and of a right kind,

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! Since you know without a doubt that we have 
allowed the persons of our university at Wittenberg to 
move to Jena at their submissive request and request for 
the sake of the mortal runs that are occurring, and we 
are told that you should be willing not to move from 
Wittenberg, we would not like to see you separate and 
isolate yourselves from the university at this time for 
many reasons, and for your own good, because you 
know what is happening daily for the sake of the divine 
word and the sacraments. Therefore, it is our gracious 
request that you direct your affairs accordingly, and also 
go there with your wife and child toward Jena, and if you 
are inclined to do so, as we provide, then you will give us 
beneficial notice of this, [so] we will arrange so that you 
may come there next with your wife and child. We do not

you, my dear Justus, for praying to the Lord for me, and 
then also for comforting me, both of which are necessary 
for me at this time, so | ask you not to cease to pray

1) Valentin Ickelsamer, from Rothenburg an der Tauber, was 
a Latin schoolmaster there and a fanatical supporter of Carlstadt. 
He wrote a fierce personal attack against Luther because of his 
alleged injustice and tyranny against Carlstadt. After the 
suppression of the peasant revolt he had to leave Rothenburg. 
Now he seems to be reconciled with Luther. 

2) As Veesenmeyer, Beitrage zur Kulturgeschichte der 
deutschen Sprache, St. 1. 2, indicates, Ickelsamer's "Tetitsche 
Grammatika" 1527, quarto, 8 sheets, was the first attempt at a 
German grammar. 

3) Zwingli with the writing: "That these words of Jesus Christ: 
This is my body, will eternally have the old unified meaning" 2c., 
which is printed in the St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 1122. The title 
of Oecolampad's writing is given in the introduction there, p. 38a. 
On Aug. 21, Luther had not yet seen both writings. 

4) The actual relocation of the university to Jena did not take

The plague has started here, but it is quite merciful;

no more than 18 corpses, with the addition of those who

pray that you will not cease to comfort me and pray for 
me, for | am wretched and poor. Not that the 
Sacramentans move us, whose ravages | have not yet 
seen nor read, and | hope through Christ that | will be a 
despiser of this Satan and even his victor. Satan himself 
rages against me with all his power, and the Lord has set 
me as asign for him, as it were as a second Job, and he

Soul in the Lord. Therefore, show Montanus this letter 
and thank him for praying so earnestly for me; this prayer 
is also necessary for us, especially for me, and | am glad 
that godly people are so concerned about us. The 
interpretation of Zechariah, which is half finished, has 
been delayed so far by my state of health. The prophets 
who began to be translated into German have likewise 
hung up their harps through our dispersion 2) [Ps. 137, 
2]. This you will say to Jacob for the sake of it, so that he 
may take care that the more urgent prayer be made for 
us, that the cry of our pestilence, for it is more true than 
the pestilence itself, may fall away through Christ as a 
physician, and that ours may again be gathered together 
to complete what is already in print. For Satan has 
aroused this fear and clamor to hinder the course of the 
Word, which he wants to

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The council and 
congregation of Belgern have now asked several times 
for Mr. Balzer Zeiger, their preacher, who has now 
served them for four years, and the monk of Buch 1) has 
the parish goods inside, also does not wait for the office, 
nor is capable of administering them. Now it is 
unreasonable that a preacher should support himself, as 
he has done so far for the benefit of the people, and can 
never do so again, so that it is to be feared that God, 
greatly angered by this, might let a punishment go over 
it. 

Now the man, Mr. Balzer, is almost well skilled, and 
[has] suffered much for the sake of the Gospel, that | am 
well inclined to forbid him to help elsewhere. But because 
| hope that E. C. F. G. will not suffer such displeasure, 
my humble request is that E. C. F. G. seriously decree 
that the above-mentioned Mr. Balzer be given a handout 
or tax from the parish goods until the visitation comes. 
For God cannot like it that another shall provide the 
parish without enjoyment and another shall use the 
goods without work, which has happened here for four 
years now. Hereby commanded by God, Amen. Tuesday

Grace and peace! | am sending two copies here for 
you and Eberhard, so that you can see that our visitators 
are not being thanked in an appropriate manner by those 
who are so busy with them. | have deliberately not 
corrected certain things, so that it would not seem to be 
my little sin. If the adversaries seek to gain glory in these 
orders, their boast is a miserable one and will not last 
long. Yes, that is why we let them console themselves, 
blow themselves out, and boast with false hope and joy 
(as they used to do until now); | like this order quite well. 
For since up to now the same thing has not been kept 
everywhere, but each one has acted according to his 
own sense, added to it, taken away from it, no uniformity 
can be brought about unless something is added or 
taken away from it. But since no one can suffer his own 
to be changed in any part, what is it to be wondered at if 
complaints or such judgments arise against the 
visitators? who, out of necessity, have changed some 
things of those people, so that they might nevertheless 
order the highest principal things in the best way. Read 
and you will approve (as | hope), then beseech the Lord 
for me, | beg you, that he may tread Satan. Our 
pestilence is mild, so that it is hardly the tenth part of the 
rumor, yes, | hope that it will be stopped for the sake of 
Christ, amen. In him be well. Wittenberg, 1527, on the

To My Most Gracious Lord, Duke John, Elector of

Grace and peace in Christ Jesus. Most Serene, 
Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! E. C. F. G.. have 
recently donated the Barefoot Monastery there to the 
Council of Wittenberg for the sick; accordingly, we, the 
priest and |, together with the Council, have inspected it 
and found that Greger Burger 1) has obtained from E. C. 
F. G. the best and most useful part, as well as the well, 
tubewells, bathrooms, brewery, and other common 
rooms and rooms, without which the other part of the 
monastery can be of little use. When we talked to him 
about it, he willingly offered to give it away for the benefit 
of the poor people, hoping that E. C. F. G. would pardon 
him with another one. 

Because such a monastery, as an old princely burial 
place, is nowhere more cheaply used, after both Jews' 
and Gentiles' burial places are held in great honor, than 
that it be decreed for God's service and poor people, in 
whom Christ Himself is preached: for this reason, in 
addition to the council, my humble request is that E. C. 
F. G. may decree and give such a monastery, together 
with the room and building of Greger Burgers, to our Lord 
Jesus Christ as a hostel and dwelling place for his poor 
members; for he says: "As you do it to the least of these, 
you do it to me" (Matth. 25,40.); and may also earnestly 
command the council to prepare it properly and without 
demolition, lest the claws of graspers fall on it and bite it 
down in time. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. Monday after,

avenged, nor is the country cleansed of these blood

that the rejoicing of the papists can be countered.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! After you and the pastor of Wittenberg have 
recently been here on our council's letter and have 
overlooked and considered the trade concerning the 
visitation, along with others of our council and those 
we have received, and it was considered good at that 
time that the same trade, if it were to be rewritten, 
should be sent to you and Pomeran again, so that it 
could be further overlooked, we are therefore sending 
you such trade herewith. And it is our gracious 
request that you, in addition to the priest, read 
through and move it diligently once more, and what 
you will do about it or from it, that you will record and 
make known to us, [so] we will know how to show 
ourselves further, so that the trade will be promoted 
and then printed. 

We also do not want to reassure you, in your 
gracious opinion, that it seems to us that the papists

have some joy that this order of the visitation should 
go out in such a way as with titles of the repentance 
report. For they want to interpret this as if one now 
wants to fall back from previous teachings to their 
abuses. And even if the opinions under the titles 
mentioned do not compare with the abuses of the 
papists, which they have led up to now because of 
the report of repentance, we do not consider it 
unacceptable that you should have distinguished 
between the report of repentance and what is similar 
under a written title of the papists, and how this order 
speaks of it, with an explanation, so that their useless 
talk would be countered all the more with it 3) and that 
the same would be rejected, and that it would not

of the town clerk of Wittenberg, M. Andreas Meinhard, who died 
in 1524. 

2) In the manuscript there is an illegible word here. We have 
assumed libenter. 


To the Austrian Severinus. 

God's grace and peace through Christ! Here, my 
dearest Severinus, you must truly see for yourself what 
you do; for what better counselor could you call upon in 
such a great matter than your own conscience? This will 
tell you everything in your ear: first, how highly you 
should regard Jerome's opinion of the monastic life in the 
letter to Heliodorus,®) , then your weakness, then your old 
and helpless father; second, how highly you should 
regard it, even if the mob, after its sacrilege, should say 
that you have thrown off the garment pleasing to God; 
Finally, what is a right profession, and again, whether it 
is not to be considered the greatest danger that you, 
against your conscience, so often say mass in such an 
ungodly manner, yes, crucify your God, Christ? For what 
do you want to pretend here, wretched man? then, why 
do you not rather consider it an ungodliness, if you stay 
longer in this Babylon, than a presumption, if you go out? 
For, if you want to hear me speak more expansively to 
you: first of all, in this matter | give nothing at all to 
Jerome, since | see, although he is a great man in many 
other things, that here, however, he has had absolutely 
no Christian judgment in regard to the monastic life and 
the celibate state. For he who dared to compare the 
monastic life with baptism was completely nonsensical 
and also lacked common sense, so that one would like to 
say that it was rather a clod than a beast who had 
gossiped about such things. How, then, will you believe 
Jerome, who speaks such ungodly things against God, 
who commands that parents be held in the highest honor 
immediately after him? And wilt thou rather hear Jerome, 
who so often errs, who so often lacks, in short, a man, 
than God Himself? Therefore, go now and hold for it, as 
Jerome writes, that one must trample parents underfoot 
in order to break out into the. To break out into the desert. 
Thus

then there will also be no weakness in this piece that it 
could be considered against the Lord. For thus says the 
Lord to Paul in the Epistles to the Corinthians [2 Cor. 
12:9], "My power is mighty in the weak." But so that even 
your helpless father is not to be esteemed higher than 
God's honor, you know the word of Christ in Matthew and 
Lucas [Matth. 10, 37. Luc. 14, 26.], that he who loves his 
parents more is not worthy of him, he cannot be his 
disciple. Moreover, if some have unseemly cast off the 
garment, let them see for themselves. But if you kept 
yours," since perhaps God's word is not so unknown to 
you, what would that be other than that you nevertheless 
wanted to keep up hypocrisy longer with these larvae? 
For if everything does not deceive me, then even if the 
whole world contradicts you in this, only your conscience 
will retain the victory against the judgment of the whole 
world. | can be deceived, but God, who searches the 
hearts, never ever. 

But as far as the calling is concerned, | would also 
advise you to wait for the will of the Lord; for this was that 
| did not want you to be called, but rather to be called out 
in this way, unless by the will of God, by the people 
calling, whom you should serve in the office of the Word. 
But now, does not what you oppose, already by yourself, 
whether you want it or not, reveal that you remain in the 
monastic life with a not so good conscience after the 
gospel has been revealed? For how? then you will say 
mass longer, and meanwhile, if it pleases GOtte, you 
refuse to be a preacher of the divine word? What, | ask 
you, can you say here with a sure conscience? Hereafter 
you see what presumption it could be considered, if you 
take off the monk, who is never commanded by God, 
never appointed, never indicated, never described. 
Read Isaiah, cap. 29 [v. 13.], Matth. 15 [v. 8. f.], Marc. 7 
[v. 6. f.], for there you will see how high human statutes 
are to be held, and yet we are still in such filthy muck. 


1) Instead of: Tuum vero we have: Tuam vero, si retineres. It 
is obvious that a supplement is necessary. 





Here, therefore, | wish that Christ would be completely 
gracious to you and make clear to you everything that is 
still in darkness there, for | hope that something of the 
splendor and the will and the goodness of God has 
enlightened you. In short, this is my opinion: Above all, 
God must be called upon so that you can completely 
surrender to His words and will, for in this way you will 
counsel yourself and your father through faith. For thou 
knowest the passage in the Acts of the Apostles [Cap. 
16, 30. f.], that Paul said to the jailer, who asked him the 
way to salvation, "Believe on the LORD JEsum, for so 
shalt thou and all thy house be saved." For what wilt thou 
fear, that either thou or thy father shall die of hunger, that 
believeth on GOD? You will sooner see heaven fall than 
believers should lack food, for you know the exceedingly 
rich promise of Christ, Matt. 6:33: "Seek ye first the 
kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these 
things shall be added unto you." What now the Lord has 
given me so far, | will plead [for you], that he deliver you 
as soon as possible from this monastic life, from the quite 
proper, all-deceptive larva of hypocrisy. For what shall | 
flatter here? what shall | say pleasant things? did not 
Christ command, Matt. 24:15 f., "When ye therefore shall 
see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel 
the prophet, that it shall stand in the holy place, then let 
them which are in the land of Judaea flee unto the 
mountains"? Do we not already see that abomination of 
desolation? and yet you would still have misgivings 
about fleeing from there? But nevertheless consult the 
Lord seriously before you leave the monastic life. For if 
thou believest not Christ, who, as thou knowest, saith 
[John 14:6], "| am the way, and the truth, and the life," 
more than the whole world, | would (as they say) wash a 
brick, though | wrote much more. Fare well in the Lord 
and pray for us. In haste. On the Sunday after Remigius 
[Oct. 6] 1527. 2) Yours, Martin Luther.

yours will also be printed again, as much as we think 
good. The Erasmus viper has concocted two

which are truly viper-poisonous and_ over-viper- 
poisonous; then Zwingli and Oecolampad do not stop

For | have been suffering almost three months, not so

ask, as | am asked, that E. C. F. G. would graciously 
command him such a parish, so that the people no longer 
remain without a pastor. It is a poor parish and a little 
house should have come from it, which E. C. F. G. could

From Erasmus' Hyperaspistes. Luther's state of health is not 
yet satisfactory. About the plague in Wittenberg. 


Printed in Aurifaber, vol. Il, p. 353 b; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 
212 and in Erl. Briefwechsel, vol. VI, p. 105. German in Walch, 
vol. XXI, 1061. 

Grace and peace through Christ! | wish you luck, best 
Jonas, because of your retraction, in which you finally 
paint that Erasmus of yours with his right colors, the 
adder, full of deadly spines, rightly recognize, whom you 
praised before in many respects. 2) | am glad that you 
have profited so much by reading the One Hyperaspistes 
and have changed your judgment about him. And when | 
read this part of your letter to my wife, she immediately 
said: "Has not theur man become a toad? Behold!" She 
is also pleased that you agree with me about Erasmus. 
You realize, my dear Jonas, that those who prescribed 
that no one should be praised before his end were 
certainly right. But enough of that. 

The Lord has not yet completely restored me to my 
former health, indeed, according to the counsel of His 
good will, He leaves me in the hands of Satan's angel to 
be beaten and attacked; but in the meantime the helping 
and protecting Lord does not elude me. In addition, two 
days ago | had a severe pain in my gums (as it seems), 
which troubled me very much in the beginning, but now | 
have it to a lesser extent; therefore, do not stop praying 
to the Lord for us. Hear this about our plague; in the 
hospital, during the whole time of the plague, not more 
than fifteen died, while in total about a hundred were} 
brought there. Then, out of 40 people who were treated 
by M. Bohemus, no more than 


1) Jonas had gone to his hometown Nordhausen, where he 
stayed because of the plague from mid-August 1527 until the end 
of January 1528. As Jonas wrote to Lang on Oct. 17, Luther had 
already written two letters to him there; they are lost. 

2) Earlier, Jonas had been a great admirer of Erasmus, and in 
1519 had even gone from Erfurt to Antwerp to see him, had also 
often praised him against Luther (cf. St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 
415, § 6), but now he changed his judgment. 





Only six of them died. Thus, even in the midst of death, 
the Lord is with us as Savior and Salvation. We pray with 
all our heart and mind to God and the Father of mercies 
to take away this plague from us for the glory of His name, 
so that our enemies will not rejoice over us. And also dll 
not cease to pray, especially since you see these fruits of 
prayer, that out of such a large! Number of disease cases 
so few die. Fare well. You will greet the child 3) with many 
kisses instead of me and my little house, who today has 
learned to poop alone with bent knees in every corner, 
yes, he has indeed pooped with extraordinary busyness 
in every corner. He would have told me more about you 
if he had had time, because he was soon bathed and 
went to sleep. Don't be surprised that | write about 
pooping, another time | will write about other things. My 
Kathe sends you her love and asks that you pray for her, 
since she will soon be in childbirth. *) Christ be with her. 
One thing | want is that it not be hidden from you, that you 
see that our prayers are not in vain. Bohemus lost only 
eight patients out of 48; there were only 15 deaths in the 
hospital during the whole plague period, although over a 
hundred who were brought in and came in were lying 
there, so that you can see that Christ hears those who 
pray. This is certain and true. Joh. Weber has been 
speechless and without hope for five days now, but his 
Dorothea, who lay down with him with little hope for life, 
is beginning to revive and will live. Greetings to your 
Kathe and all. On Saturday after Lucas [Oct. 19] 1527.

Satan's angel, that Christ may not abandon me. Oh, over 
me wretched, who am so unlike Leonhard: | am an 
eloquent preacher, he a mighty doer of the word. Who will 
make me worthy to overcome Satan and depart from this 
life not with a twofold spirit, but only with half of his spirit? 
Praise be to God, who has shown us unworthy ones, 
among so many abominations, at least this One glorious 
sound play of His grace, so that it may not seem as if He 
had abandoned us altogether. Pray for me, Brother 
Michael, Christ grant that we too may follow Leonhard. He| 
is not only called a king, but rightly an emperor (Caesar), 
because he defeated him whose power is not equal to any 
other on earth. He is not only a priest, but also a high 
priest and a right priest, because he gave his body to God 
for such a pleasing, living and holy sacrifice (Rom. 12,1.). 
Yes, he is also rightly called Leonhard, which is lion 
strength; certainly he was a strong and undaunted lion; all 
names point to his fortune. He first consecrated andi 
fulfilled his family name. 

My almost stammering Hanschen thanks your 
mistress and sends her greetings; | and my Kathe also 
pray for her that she will be well in Christ together with her 
children. Pommer loves you very much and sends you his 
greetings. Fare well in Christ. Tuesday after Luca [Oct:

Letters from the year 


Grace and peace! As it pleases the Lord, so it 
happens, my dear Amsdorf, that |, who used to comfort 
everyone, am in need of all comfort myself. This one thing 
| ask, and you will ask it with me, that my Christ do with 
me what pleases him, only may he protect me so that | do 
not become ungrateful and an enemy of him whom | have 
so far preached and worshipped with such great zeal and 
fervor, even though | have meanwhile offended him 1) 
with many and great sins. Satan desires that Job be given 
to him anew [Job, Cap. 2], and to sift Peter together with 
the brethren (Luc. 22, 31.); but Christ deigns to say to him 
[Job 2, 6.], "Spare his life," and to say to me [Ps. 35, 3.], 
"Lam thy help,” as | still hope that he will not be eternally 
angry at my sins. | wish to answer the Sacramentarians, 
but if | do not become stronger in spirit, | will not be able 
to do anything, | will keep your copy, but | will return it in 
its time. 

In my house it has begun to be a hospital. Hanna, 
Augustin's 2) wife, has had the plague internally, but is 
getting better. Margaretha Mochin 3) has frightened us 
with a suspicious ulcer and other signs, although she is 
also getting better. | fear very much for my Kathe, who is 
close to giving birth, because my little son has also been 
ill for three days, does not eat anything, and is in a bad 
way. They say it is the eruption of the teeth, and it is 
believed that both are in great danger. For the wife of 
Capellan Georg,” who is also close to childbirth, has been 
seized by the plague, and they are now trying to find a 
way to save the child. May the Lord Jesus mercifully help 
her. So there are internal struggles, internal fears, and 
even hard ones, Christ is haunting us. It is a consolation 
that we oppose the raging Satan, namely, that we at least 
have the

George had a miscarriage, and she herself immediately 
followed the child and died, and that of a twofold death, 
first through the pain of childbirth, then poisoned to the 
utmost by the poison of the plague; and Christ heard 
neither our tears nor our prayers for her preservation at 
that time. But this gave some comfort that she went to 
Christ in a very good end, that is, full of faith and spirit. 
Since everyone was moved by terror, | took the priest 
and his family to my home. My Kathe is still strong in faith 
and healthy in body. My little house has been ill for eight 
days with a doubtful illness (as | almost suspect [of the 
illness] of this time), but they say it is the eruption of the 
teeth, and so they believe. According to the Capellan's 
wife, no death occurred yesterday or today.

Christ grant that this may be the end of the plague. In the 


fishermen's suburb the plague has already ceased, and 
there the weddings are beginning anew, and they are 
resuming their amusements, but nothing certain can be 
promised. For eight days ago the plague had almost 
ceased in the city, so that there was hardly a death every 
day, but suddenly, as the air changed, within two days 
there were twelve deaths in one day, although most of 
them were children. Augustin's wife lay eight days and 
longer with an internal ulcer, and nothing other than the 
plague can be suspected, but she is recovering. In the 
same way, Margaretha Mochin is lying down with me; 
they say it is a disease of her rule, but they fear it is the 
plague. So, if you look at the suspicion, | am in the midst 
of the plague in my house, but if you look at the matter, it 
is life and salvation, albeit a contested one. | will have 1) 
commended us to your prayers. Dorothea's husband 2) 
has died, she is in any case out of danger, although an 
ulcer remains stubbornly unresolved, neither receding 
nor ripening. My Kathe sends you her regards and

that the plague will end here, although it plagues us in

Littau by E. C. F. G., has agreed with He Peter Ehlen, 
so that he ceded the previous parish of Buchholz and 
Ludersdorf, and until E. C. F. G.'s order grant him and 
leave it. Now, however, the aforementioned Werner has 
been driven out of the market for the sake of the Gospel, 
and has had to leave everything to his own people in a 
somewhat respectable manner, as a canon of 
Brandenburg, and thus live in misery and poverty: my 
humble request is that E. C. F. G. would pardon him with 
the same parish; for who knows what he would still be 
useful for? He would be worth much better, but because 
nothing else is available, he must suffer hardship until [it] 
becomes better. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. Tuesday

E. C. F. G. have had the priest of N. 5) sentenced to N.

in a matrimonial matter. But because he confesses his 
guilt, as it is not well done, and thus humbly offers himself

and release him, considering that he is a good and 
honest friend here in Wittenberg, for the sake of which 
reputation, admonished by such a serious punishment, 
he will doubtless take better care from now on. Satan has 
easily led a man into disgrace and dishonor, especially 
those who are to preside over others, as we well know 
every day. Therefore, it is no wonder that he has also 
hurried this good pastor with this matter and led him into 
disgrace. E. C. F. G. will, | hope, graciously stand against 
him. Hereby commanded to God, Amen. Monday after St.

work. Finally the conscience of the unfaithful woman stirred and 
she presented her case to Luther. The latter had Hornung

Johann Pfeffinger came to you and accepted the parish 
with you through our request and prayers, so that he 
would also be moved. But the matter has gained an 
impetus. For, praise God, people are beginning to think 
that clever people want to become expensive, and both 
the council and the congregation of Sonnenwald, together 
with their overlord, Mr. Nickel voll Mynkewitz, have 
opposed it so strongly and have asked and written so 
humbly, Christianly, diligently, twice now, not to take such 
their pastor from them, and also do not want to let him do 
so for obvious reasons, which they indicate, so that they 
not only catch the pastor's conscience, but also ours, but 
also our conscience, because they also promised and 
bound themselves to take care of him in a respectable 
and honest way, so that we do not trust you to provide this 
Johann, because we do not like anything against 
conscience and force, hoping that you will grant us such, 
because it happened in the opinion that we did not know 
otherwise at that time, and also held in truth that Johann 
Pfeffinger was loose and could easily be demanded away. 

But so that you may nevertheless feel that we are 
inclined to you and willing to serve, we hereby send you 
Hieronymus Werner, 1) letter pointer, whom you may hear 
this holiday and try how he pleases you; for he travels to 
you at our will, promised nothing, and, if he pleases you 
and you desire his, indicate to us in writing, so that we 
may talk further with him, to accept the office with you. But 
ask E. W. kindly to inform your citizens that skilled 
teachers and pastors are truly expensive now, and not as 
mean as the Terminarians 2) were in the past, and begin 
to discuss why a city now in evangelical times wants to be 
burdened to give a hundred guilders to an honest, pious 
pastor, when before it may have given three or four 
hundred guilders to a single pastor, who nevertheless 
preached nothing or ever preached no gospel. Such 
meagreness truly makes skilled preachers expensive 
now, and in time will again become a vain ass, or worse 
than a mule. 


1) Werner was not accepted as a pastor in Zerbst. 
2) Terminarians == wandering mendicant monks. 





Donkeys, as the seducers are, bring to the parishes. For 
it is easy to find someone who would take twenty guilders 
and be a parish priest; but how the parish is supplied with 
it will be found out. | ask you to consider this and not let 
it be difficult for you to provide for an honest man 
honestly. Hereby commanded by God. On Christmas Eve

To the Lords of Einsiedel. 


Grace and peace in Christ Jesus, amen. Strict, 
onorable, dear lords and friends! We are sorry for your 
isfortune and cross, which you have met through your 
yrant. May Christ our Lord comfort and strengthen you in 
his and all distresses, and may He punish Satan in time 
nd in the near future, amen. 

At your request, if you seek our counsel, we find it no 
ther way than: because you do not have preachers in the 
laces that are in Duke George's fief who are against him, 
e therefore has no power nor right to punish you. If there 
re such preachers in the same places, you may in good 
onscience allow them to leave, and leave room for the 
yrant of his will, in which he has power and authority 2c. 

But because N. and N. and the like lie in the 
lectorate's territory and sovereignty, he has neither the 
ight nor the power to punish what happens to your 
ersons. Therefore, | think it is justified that E. Gestrenge 
ust let things go as they are in the Electorate and not 
ave the power to change anything, as you have 
nswered Mr. N. 

If this does not help, it seems to me that the Elector 
hould be called upon to intercede, in this opinion, that his 
. F. G. Duke Georgen should be asked to intercede. 
uke Georgen, because it would be divided principality, 
nd treaty happen that each one in his principality should 
et believe as he likes: so his request would be that, as 
uke Hans punishes none, in Duke Georgen land sat, at 
he goods, so nevertheless from the Elector go to the fief, 
o he also does not want to punish those, who sit in the 
lectorate 2c., even if they commit crimes in his fiefs; for 
uch would be unjust and unequal. Such, | think, you will 
etter consider together with good friends and tell, than 


On Saturday after St. Lucy's Day (Dec. 14), Duke George had 
forbidden the 18 villages belonging to the Einsiedel brothers, 
Heinrich Hildebrand (b. 1497, d. 1557) and Heinrich Abraham (d. 
1568 at the age of 64), were forbidden to do interest, pension, 
service and wages, because the Einsiedels should have a priest 
at Gnandstein (located in the Chursachsichen area not far from 
Altenburg), who had a wife, likewise because they would have 
dropped the mass, and would not have had the bridal mass said 
at their sister's wedding (Spalatin apud Menck..., Il, 2129). The 
Einsiedels then turned to Luther, who gave them his advice. On 
Jan. 9, 1528, the Einsiedels went to Dresden and, through Haug 
von LeiBneck, Wolf von Schénburg and other friends, asked the 
duke to drop his disgrace and to abolish the hindrance of their 
interest and services. The success of these efforts is shown in the 
Wittenberg edition, Vol. IX, p. 246 d, in the document that 
precedes our letter: "Duke Georgm gave his farewell to those of 
Einsiedel 2) 2c. After much negotiation, this farewell is finally given 
by his F. G. on Friday after Erhardi [Jan. 10] 1528: 

"Heinrich Hildebrand and Heinrich Abraham von Einsiedel, 
brothers, shall in all our fiefdoms and principalities, where they 
have authority, keep all Christian order, and drive out the heretical 
priests and appoint others in their place who are Christian priests, 
or request them from those who have to grant the fiefdoms. If they 
lack this from the same, they shall seek our help and counsel, 
which they shall not be denied. 

"They themselves, in order that they may have acted contrary 
to the obedience of the Christian church, shall obtain absolution 
from the bishop, as the highest prelate, or elsewhere, where such 
absolution may be obtained. And they shall observe masses, hear 
sermons, confession and communion, as befits the order of 
Christian churches. Then we want to let go of what they consider 
to be disgraceful to them. 

"But nevertheless, for the intercession of their lords and 
friends, and also for the sake that we may not be noted as seeking 
our benefit, but not their souls’ salvation, we will leave them the 
goods, so that they may sell those between here and 
Bartholomew, and turn to the end, where their disobedience may 
be suffered 2c. 

"Duke George wants to know clearly and without any doubt 
whether the von Einsiedel want to renounce the Lutheran 
doctrine, and to keep and show themselves with confession and 
reception of the reverend sacrament 2c." The von Einsiedel asked 
for and received 5 weeks to think about it, and are supposed to : 
have given an answer again on Friday Valentini [Feb. 14] (Spal. I. we can write.

Nor confess that you have sinned at the bride's mass; but 
if anything is wrong in all or some of this, you shall suffer

his head, you must stand and confess what he wants to 
condemn and wrong. For there Christ stands, 
"Whosoever shall deny me, him will | deny again." 

But if he is satisfied that his fiefdoms are in

resist force. The prince is obliged to defend as far as his

Justus Jonas to Luther. 


This letter crossed with Luther's letters of Dec. 29 and 30, 
1527. Jonas hoped to return to Wittenberg soon. He regrets the 
dispute between Melanchthon and Agricola. Judgment on 
Oekolampad and comrades. He congratulates Luther on the birth 
of his daughter. About the illness of D. Meienburg. Jonas sends a 
gift for Hans Luther.

2) The time of this letter is (according to the Erl. Briefw.): "5% 
post Circumcisionis M. D. XXVII." In this all are eternal that the 
year 1527 is a spelling mistake of Luther. In contrast, the indistinct 
number of the date is read differently. Kolde reads: 2' " and 
resolves it by secunda the == 2nd Jan. Kawerau reads: and 
likewise completes the, because if one wanted to grasp it after 
usual way as ......... i, that is Tuesday after New Year, then one 
would arrive at the 7th January; Jonas however answered this 
letter already on the 6th January. Apart from the unusualness of 
the addition of the, the syllable "fa" would hardly have been 
chosen as designation of the final syllable of secunda and tertia. 
The Erl. Briefw. will be right.

| am very happy that a little daughter has been 
born to you, and that you write that you want me to 
hurry to you at least for a walk: there has never been 
a month that | have stayed here without thinking of 
mounting a horse to go to you, but every month the

Meienburg, 1). He appreciates your so_ kindly 
announced greeting very much. But he is now very ill, 
with | don't know what part of his intestines protruding 
from the back; he thinks it is quite the same illness you 
suffered from three years ago. You will recognize the 
severe complaints of the sufferer from the enclosed 
letter. He therefore sent this messenger at his own 
expense. He sends a description of his illness, which 
he kindly asks to be shown to the physician, Doctor 
Esch, so that he may write here through this 
messenger the indicated remedies, which he has 
used on you; and if you also have experience as to 
what has eased your pain, what has contributed most 
to the expulsion of this illness, then | ask you to 
communicate it to me, so that | can pass it on to him. 
For he alone has rendered the best service to the 
cause of the Gospel, and his enemies would like him 
to be dead by now. Whatever Doctor Esch will 
demand, you shall say good for it, for he will gladly 
give what is right. But why do | ask this of you in so 
many words, since you were born to love? | only 
wanted to remind you that the messenger should not 
return without a note for the medicines and all the

To the mayor and council of Zerbst. 


Luther asks that the people of Zerbst finally be satisfied that 
Pfeffinger, whom they had only accepted on probation until 
Invocavit (March 1), could not come to them. 


The original is in the Rathsarchiv at Zerbst (dated "1527" due 
to a typographical error by Luther). Printed by Sintenis, 
Denkschrift, p. 34; in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 175 (without 
correction of the date) and by De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 
89. 

To the honorable and wise gentlemen, mayor and 
council of Zerbst, my favorable gentlemen and 
good friends. 

Grace and peace. Honorable, wise, dear gentlemen! 
| recently wrote to E. W. how he could not leave Johann 
Pfeffinger in Sonnenwalde and keep him, if he would get 
along with you. | had hoped that E. W. would be satisfied 
with this, because God prevents it without our doing and 
knowledge, which prevents human relationships several 
times, and no one can continue to associate or keep an 
agreement, unless God wants it. Since it is not lacking in 
him nor in us, nor is it in our power, | ask again that E. W. 
be satisfied with it; for |, with a good conscience, continue 
to drive him white, and indeed, because | heard that he 
would be accepted on probation with you until Invocavit, 
| was all the easier for it, and hoped that it would not be 
necessary with you for such a short time, and let me, as 
| also let myself still be, be the more content with it.

No. 1174. 


Torgau. January 3, 1528. 


Elector John of Saxony to Luther. 

The Elector asks Luthern to enforce the "instruction" for the 
visitation drafted by Spalatin and to report his concerns and 
changes to it in writing. 

The concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. Ji, fol. 50a. 
Printed by Burkhardt, p. 126 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VI, p. 179. 

Our greeting before. Venerable and highly learned, 
dear devotee! Next to other scholars of the Holy 
Scriptures, we had required you to come to Torgau, 
1) to further consider the instruction that should be 
followed in our principality by pastors, preachers and 
pastoral caretakers, as was done by you and the 
others who were required by us, which also pleased 
us graciously, and at that time it was agreed that you 
would make a preface that should stand on a 
narrative; You should then also diligently review the 
same, and whatever you find that needs to be 
changed again, or that needs to be done to it or from 
it, you should do so in the most appropriate manner. 
As we do not want to conceal from you that Magister 
Spalatinus has formally rewritten with his own hand 
the above-mentioned instruction and sent it to us, 
which we send to you herewith. And it is our gracious 
request to you, that you do the above according to 
your good-willed request, still once take it in hand and 
consider it most diligently, as you know how to do by 
the grace of God, and improve and change what 
seems good to you. And especially consider whether 
it should be good that the sub

(2) for the reception of the sacrament of the body and 
blood of Christ, which shall be done by you next to the 
other articles, with distinction as to the strong, the 
weak and the impudent (3) for the sake of the pastors 
and preachers, or it would be better to leave them out 
and to report them to the pastors and preachers in the 
visitation, [so that they], if the matter should ever arise, 
would have to act accordingly, as far as the degrees 
of friendship and mogship are concerned. For it has 
fallen to us that if the same article were to be added to 
the others and put into print, it might give the 
opponents of Hohenish cause to hold all the more 
firmly to it, so that those who in our principality marry 
closer, 4) than in ecclesiastical rights, to which the 
imperial rights are subordinate and escape, or their 
children, produced in such marital states, would not be 
granted and follow inheritances. The people, if they 
were to do so outside of our lands, would also suffer 
other hardships because of it. Since we also consider 
that, in the present world, the common man is not 
particularly interested in this, after he can proceed to 
more convenient marriages outside of the same 
degrees, we want to put this into your further 
consideration, whether such retraction and shortening 
of the degrees should be brought into the affected 
report or not, to give notice thereof to the pastors 
through the visitators, to report to the people of the 
liberty, and again of the burden and disadvantage that 
would stand upon it and might result to them, whether 
thereby those, who are not noticeably or especially 
interested in it, 5) might slacken such marriages in 
friendship below the fifth degree. But if you consider 
this, it would be useful or good to put this in the report 
and to express it, because in imperial law it is foreseen 
that one should not take, have or marry his brother's 
wife or two sisters, even after each other, so you want 
to move whether marriage with such persons is to be 
avoided according to imperial law or not. So you will 
also find several more articles in the trades that 
Spalatinus has placed in further concern, which you 
will also find in passing. 


2) This is the concern No. 1168. 

3) "Frechen" is put by us instead of: "Reichen", because in the 
concerning place not of "Reichen" but of "Halsstarrigen" is 
spoken. 

4) "closer" put by us instead of: "more". In the following: "to 
which the" instead of: "to which the".

Printed by Burkhardt, p. 125 (with the note that this 
commemorative note, probably written as early as December 
1527, was sent to Luther by the Saxon chancellery, at any rate 
with Spalatin's reservations [Supplement II]) and in Erl. Briefw., 
vol. VI, p. 181. 


Memorial note for Doctor Martinus 
Luther, to be sent in addition to the 
lessons. 


To put in mind to the clan and mogschaft where the 
Lord Chancellor Doctor Brick would have found more 
forbidden degrees in imperial rights. 

Item, whether it would be appropriate to let up, to 
take two sisters one after the other. 

Item, that one sends the Doctori Martins the whole 
teaching of Christian doctrine and ceremonies with the 
request to oversee and spread it everywhere 2c. 

Item, to remind Doctor Martinus to put aside the 
argument of the adversaries and others who say and 
think that because we are redeemed by Christ from 
divine laws, we should rather be exempt from imperial 
rights and not be bound by them, before in these 
cases, so that one also has to judge oneself the more 
wisely from them. 

Item to remind Doctor Martinus to indicate the locos 
how in Scripture contritio, poenitentia, cognitio peccati, 
mortificatio are used for One Thing. 

Item, the case with leprosy and other protracted 
diseases in the marital status and the like well to 
eliminate, because the same cases occur a lot.

In the Scriptures there is no cause to 
Marriage to divorce, because the adultery, [placet. 
(red)] as then indicates the Christ himself

1067 


Matthew 5 [v. 22] and 19 [v. 9]. But 
before the divorce, all diligence 
should be made to reconcile and 
make up. For it is not proper for a wife 
to put away an adulterer, nor for a 
husband to put away his wife on 
account of adultery, without the 
knowledge of the church, that is, of 
those whom the church has 
commanded. 

It is not proper for a woman who 
has left her husband for the sake of 
adultery to marry another husband in 
any way, unless the divorce takes 
place before the church, that is, 
before the pastors. 


And if one spouse departs from the placet. 
other, in this case nothing should be __ (roth) 
decided thoughtlessly, but the person 
who has departed should be diligently 
sought to bring him or her to justice. 

The innocent person shall not be 
allowed to marry in other ways, 
unless the person who has left has 
been previously requested, promised 
and required by the authorities. 

In the event that a wife is afflicted 
with French disease or leprosy, the 
husband is not entitled to take 
another wife, because the disease is 
not a sufficient reason to divorce the 
marriage. 

The unkindness and cruelty is also 
not enough cause to divorce 
spouses, because one must suffer 
and tolerate the other.

If a man brings down a virgin, love placet. 
demands that he take her in marriage. (roth) 
He shall also be faithfully admonished 
and kept to do so. But if he will not take 
her in marriage, he shall give her a 
convenient and due dowry. For this 
penalty also stands in divine law Exodi 
at 22 [v. 16], [and if the parents or 
friendship of the prostitute do not 
oppose and do not refuse to give him 
the prostitute, he must keep her as a 
wife, as Deut. 22, 29.> stands,] and 
although the law Mosi does not bind us, 
yet love [and equity] demands that one 
act in this way. 

Even if a man takes a wife without the will of his 
parents, it is right for him to keep her. For although 
the parents have a right to the children, as God 
commanded in Exodus 22 [v. 17] and Deuteronomy 
22 [v. 28 f.] 1). [commanded] to give him the wife 
whom he indicated to them, as it is written in the 
Book of Judges on the 14th [v. 2], and to Rebekah 
parents, mother and brother [gave her when she 
was] 2) sought to Isaac by his father Abraham's 
servant for his conjugal wife; yet to Rebekah 
friendship spoke, as it is written in Genesis on the 
24th [v. 57], "Let us call the harlot" 2c. 

But now, because the wicked hear that the 
parents have the right to the children, they go to, 
abuse the same right and become tyrants from it. 
Again, because the children hear that they are both 
allowed to do so by imperial and papal law, they also 
abuse it and despise the parents, which is not good 
for either part and yet happens many times. 

Therefore, in such a case, two ways would have to 
be taken: First, the gospel. Namely, that the children 
humble themselves against the parents and by 
themselves or through

ask some persons to allow the pledge, which they 
made against their will,?) , if a child would have a 
desire for the person, and the person would be 
honest. If the father wants to act according to the 
gospel, he is obliged to listen to his child's request; if 
the father does not want to grant it, the child is not 
obliged to do anything against the father's tyranny. 
Secondly, if the gospel does not help, the father 
must be informed that because he does not want to 
grant his honest request to his child, who has a desire, 
will, love and good opinion of the betrothed person, 
and does not consider his child's happiness and need, 
and kindly and paternally impose the execution of the 
marriage vows, he should adhere to the imperial 
rights. For since the parents despise the gospel, they 
should not enjoy the gospel either, but keep to the 
imperial right. Right hold. 
For what is in accordance with imperial law is due 
© a prince as secular authority. For what is in 
accordance with imperial law is due to a prince, as 
ecular authority, to pronounce and recognize. 
The pastors and preachers have to indicate this on 
he basis of God's word. For even if secular authorities 
ould do nothing more about it at the humble, 
ubmissive request of the children, the children of the 
parents shall suffer and tolerate tyranny and 
lunkindness. 


Of clanships and mogships. 


Although in the law Mosi the all dead. degree, it is 
not forbidden for a man to take his brother's or sister's 
aughter in marriage, as Leviticus well points out in 
hapter 18, and the examples of the holy archfathers 
braham and Nahor confirm, both of whom took their 
brother's daughters, namely Abraham took Sarah and 
Nahor took Milcah (Genesis 1:16).

1) for the sake of most of those who at that time 
had to buy such degrees from the pope for money 
and yet had no good conscience. But since we 
intend to give common instruction on how the 
pastors should act and teach in this matter, we 
consider it best that we keep to the imperial laws. 
Not that" we thereby condemn those, who perhaps 
until now would have bought such freedom from 
the pope or, according to the law of Mosi, would 
have taken it from their sister or brother daughter, 
but that we should henceforth surrender ourselves 
to live in harmony with the imperial rights and also 
forgive that, according to the law of Mosi, we 
would have right and power before God, to serve 
and love those, who at the same time live with us 
under imperial rights. 

Which kinship and mogschaft [Todt.] according 
to ability and order prevent the marriage. 

Also in such a way, if persons in such forbidden 
degrees about prohibition of touched rights take to 
the marriage, also such marriage is unbundled, 
that the woman is not called a wife and the man is 
not called a husband. 

First, the persons [Todt.] related to each other 
in the ascending and descending line are 
forbidden to marry in intnituni through and 
through. [Todt.] 

Secondly, brother and sister may not marry; 
neither may one take his brother's or sister's 
daughter or grandson. Likewise, it is forbidden to 
marry one's father's, grandfather's, mother's, or 
grandmother's sister.

Concerns to the Elector Johann zu Sachsen. 


This is the answer to the letter of the Elector of January 3, No. 
1174. This concern is found, by Luther's own hand, in the Weimar 
archives; printed from it in De Wette, Vol. Ill, p. 258 and 
(according to De Wette) in the Erlangen edition, Vol. 53, p. 417, 
as well as in no other edition. Because the first two paragraphs 
were included almost entirely in the teaching of the visitators, De 
Wette has given the locations of this writing. This has been 
misunderstood by the Erlanger Ausgabe and taken as proof of 
the locations of our thought in the editions; likewise the Erlanger 
Briefwechsel, which gives vol. VI, p. 187: "Erl. 53, 417 2c. and 
den daselbst angefuhrten Orten." 


Where the article of either form is to be omitted, it 
should be commemorated in this or that way. 








And after the holy Gospel (praise to God) has 
come to day, in which we are clearly testified that both 
forms of the Sacrament are to be administered and 
taken by all Christians according to the institution and 
command of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that it is not 
for any man to change such divine institution, for no 
man's last will is to be changed, as Paul writes to the 
Galatians, much less is God's own last will to be 
changed: accordingly we have instructed the pastors 
and preachers to teach such doctrine.

to teach the gospel of both forms to everyone, be he 
strong, weak or stiff-necked, and in no way to approve the 
one form, but to punish it as unjust and against the 
appointment and last will of our Savior and Lord JESUS 
CHRIST, so that the teaching of it may be carried oul 
freely and purely in public. 

Since no one can be forced to believe, nor can his 
unbelief be enforced by commandment or force, since 
God does not want any forced service, and wants to have 
only voluntary servants, people are of so many different 
minds and abilities, 1) that it has been and still is 
impossible for us to determine certain measures on 
persons to whom such two forms should be given on 
refused according to the teachings of Christ: Therefore, 
even though we may easily teach the doctrine purely and 
freely as given by Christ Himself, yet the custom and 
practice of such doctrine is not to be put into certain 
measure or persons, considered that by such old and 
common custom of your form the people have been hard 
caught, and now almost and hardly doubt. And so we 
must leave the day its twelve hours, and command the 
things to God, 2) but in such a way that such should be 
reserved and commanded to the Visitatoribus, that they| 
be recognized by them according to the skill and occasion 
of each parish, according to the place or the people, give 
the parish priests in particular verbal instruction or a 
written list of which parish priests are to be refused both 
forms or tolerated and given one form, so that the doctrine 
remains pure and free, and yet no one is urged to do 
anything against his conscience, or the sacrament is 
taken from him, who has had the right to it, against his| 
right. 


Haec vel similia dicentur; ex his etiam de- . mantul

the like may be said; from it may also be taken away on

From the clans. 


Although in the law Most the degree is not forbidden, 
if someone takes his brother's or sister's daughter in 
marriage, as the Levit. at the eighteenth chapter well 
points out and the examples of the holy arch fathers 
Abraham and Nahor confirm, who both took their brother 
Haran's daughters, namely Abraham the Sara, and 
Nahor the Milca, Genes. on the eleventh, as Doctor 
Martinus Luther has also previously indicated in writings, 
mostly for the sake of those who at that time had to buy 
such degrees from the pope for money and yet had no 
good conscience 3) nor Scriptural testimony or reason 
for themselves, so we also see that Christ has not 
abrogated such things in the Gospel, but rather confirms 
them when he says: "What God has joined together, let 
no man put asunder"; therefore we did not know how to 
condemn those who had bought such freedom from the 
pope or had taken the daughter of their sister or brother 
according to the law of Moses. 

But since the custom of such freedom has been 
abolished by papal laws, and its law has come into 
tremendous use throughout the world, and is being 
enforced, so that the consciences are quite hard- 
pressed, it is also evident that marriage is a widespread 
matter, and people marry each other especially on the 
borders, We have found that people, in some cases 
cleverly, do some of the impertinence that they 
afterwards regret, that they use more of the liberty out of 
sheer conceit without any need, that they sometimes 
cause nothing but trouble, and that there are many other 
things that we have experienced daily; Such causes and 
the like have prevented us from having any certain 
measure, way or persons to vote, for we cannot put a 
rope on the weak conscience, nor set a measure for the 
people of foreign rule to be free, or prevent them from 
being free. Therefore, we must separate doctrine and 
custom, let the doctrine go, but reserve the custom to the 
Visitatoribus, that they give the pastors and preachers 
verbal instruction or a written record, how they keep 
themselves.

shall recognize and find the opportunity in such custom, 
according to the cities, places, people and persons, and 
shall seek and use advice and assistance in this respect 
from Our Lord the Elector as the ordinary secular 
authority, because some of the marriage matters are also 
subject to secular and worldly rights. H., the Elector, as 
an ordinary secular authority, because the matrimonial 
matters are partly also subject to secular and worldly 
rights. ?) 


Hic similiter addatur, mutetur, dematur, quod visum 
fuerit. [Here, what seems to be good may be added, 
changed, demolished in the same way]. 


On the case in matrimonial matters with red A marked 


It should be considered whether such a piece should 
be left outside, and especially because leprosy separates 
people from the community according to Moses' laws and 
according to all the country's customs, and perhaps a 
case could arise that it would be impossible for one to 
remain without a wife, again the people are also evil, 
easily seeking causes to leave and avoid the sick 
women: Whether such should also be ordered especially 
to the parish priests by the visitators, after which they 
would recognize the opportunity of the persons and 
things, which are truly diverse and impossible to put into 
a law’, as | often experienced. Christians know well how 
to keep to this, as is stated in the lessons; but how does 
it go with the others? 


Recorded in the case with 6. 





Whether it would not be suitable that such a thing 
would be declared, than that it would be understood only 
by the woman, who would also be asleep about the 
betrothal; because that father and mother should not 
have the power to change a bad betrothal, seems to me 
to give too much room to the wanton children, because 
in the law Mosi God Himself has set that child vows, also 
done by God, are in the power of the parents, Num. XXX. 
But where the secret betrothal will occur, by the means 
indicated above, this will also be well advised, and may 
be left outside. 

That in the note 2) is considered how the opponents 
are to be embarrassed their argument, so 


1) "are" put by us instead of: "is". 
2) This is Supplement | to the previous number. 


saying that because we are redeemed from God's laws 
through Christ, we should also be much more free from 
imperial laws than in these cases: this is bad above by 
the means indicated, 3) because we do not want to follow 
imperial laws in this 2c. Otherwise, in 4) the teaching is 
also sufficiently provided, how we are free and not free 
from all other laws, namely, according to the body subject 
to all laws, according to the conscience subject to no law, 
as the preachers will learn this from the Postilion and 
other books. 


Likewise, that one should indicate the looos where in 
Scripture contritio, poenitentio, cognitio peccati etc. 
is a thing. It is not necessary, because the Visitatores 
do not write a disputation, but an instruction, and show 
what they should search and teach in the Scriptures. 
There they will find it themselves. Otherwise, one would 
have to write a large book about it and give the 
quarrelsome cause to dispute and be clever. There is 
enough of it in the lessons. 


The note 5) from the enthusiasts is not highly 
necessary, because nevertheless without that probably 
my gn. H. may do; but she does not stand badly in it. 


From the case with reddish B. recorded. 


It is worth considering whether such a piece should 
be transfigured further, for we know what such a case has 
also given the pope to worry about, namely, if someone 
had become engaged to one and married another, 
especially as the first betrothal is secret, and yet could 
not break off nor depart from the other. Here one thinks 
that he breaks the marriage with the other, as often as he 
sleeps on her, and some want to despair, as | have often 
experienced the misery. In this | am uncertain, for it 
seems to me to be a hard thing that souls press so hard. 
It is true that Scripture also confirms with examples that 
the first is the right woman, as Deut. XXII. soonsa uxor 
is called and Rachel also remained the right wife, 
although Lea was slept by Jacob 2c. afterwards, and 
Mary is called Joseph's wife, 


3) That is: set right, ordered. 
4) "inn" == in, not "them" as De Wette resolves it. 5) This 
seems to be a lost supplement.

since it was trusted, Matth. and Luc. Il. But because 
the law dealt freely with wives, as Michal was given first 
to David, then to Adriel 1) and Merob, Saul's daughter, 
was betrothed first to David and then to another, | 
wonder if the law is wise enough for Mosi, or if the 
subsequent marriage should not destroy the first 
betrothal, as often happens in other marriages 
involving life and property, that a betrothal is destroyed 
by accidental things. | am writing this because it is 
especially difficult for me to leave consciences in 
desolation or doubt, unless bright, clear sayings force 
us to do so. Our pastor keeps it as it says in the lessons 
above, and | am satisfied that they conclude without 
me. But my conscience is not yet sure 2c. One should 
also reserve this for the visitatoribus, because it is 
dangerous to go out in such cases and put laws under

Advice on how the von Einsiedel should behave towards Duke 
George for the sake of their conscience: they should not chase|

should suffer if he were to be chased away.

247; in the Jena edition (1566), vol. IV, p. 314.b; in the Altenburg,

Grace and peace in Christ. Worthy dear master and 
priest! At your request in the matter of von Einsiedel, this} 
is recently our understanding. Because Duke Georg 
wants to consider himself the sovereign and overlord of 
Gnanstein, he must be allowed to rule, not only rule, but 
also tyrannize, as St. Peter teaches, even to suffer blows! 
from unruly lords. For he uses his power over souls that 
he is not right. God will judge this; they must suffer it.

Phalti, 1 Sam. 25,44. 





No. 1175. 1176. 1077 

But the von Einsiedel shall first show themselves on the 
opinion: Since they have no authority, neither from God nor 
from men, to judge doctrine, soul and spiritual things, but 
only to rule over the body and goods of the subjects: so 
they have so far let the priest do as he knows how, and 
also do not yet know (as they are not spiritual, but secular 
rulers), to oppose the teachers or teachers. How they 
would have understood that the Holy Father would have 
kept the secular government himself, and left the spiritual 
government to the clergy, as God has ordered it and also 
wants it. 

But where Duke George wants to command them to 
chase away the parish priest, and to keep the people to the 
old custom 2c.: then they shall not commit themselves to 
it, and to be executors of such tyranny, and thus to be 
partakers of its unrighteousness, but humbly ask, H. F. G.. 
would overrule such a commandment and graciously 
signify that, although others judge, condemn and expel 
persons over spiritual matters, violate God and also papal 
and all rights, they could not do so against their 
consciences, because divine majesty's order and 
commandment compels them to rule only secularly and not 
spiritually. And the Holy Father therefore wanted to spare 
their consciences, since the Holy Father could not judge 
them, and not urge them to do otherwise. 

If S. F. G. ever does not want to let up that S. F. G. 
sends a magistrate to Gnanstein, who exequires and 
creates such things, they want to grant him, as the highest 
feudal lord and sovereign, to do such things: that S. F. G. 
(and not they, the von Einsiedel) takes on conscience and 
bears what is done or happens or remains. F. G. (and not 
they, the von Einsiedel) would take and bear on S. F. G.'s 
conscience what would be done or would happen or would 
remain. 

For the people of Einsiedeln must guard their 
conscience in this, that they do not help the tyrant against 
the Gospel, but rather yield, clear away and let him do it. 
If, however, such a thing were done by Duke Georgen, that 
he wanted to force them to execute such a commandment, 
they would have to refuse to obey him; for they cannot do 
it with God, as they know how to do it in the most gentle 
and humble way. 

But it must be said to the subjects that

Luther tells him that Stiefel is now in Wittenberg and 
encourages him to hold fast to the Gospel.

Erlanger Ausgabe, vol. 53, p. 395. In De Wette and in the Erl. 
edition, this letter and the next one are dated 1527, but it belongs 
to the year 1528. On Jan. I, 1527, Stiesel, as we see from Luther's 
letter to him (No. 1049), had escaped from Tolleth, but soon 
returned, and had not yet gone to Wittenberg, as De Wette thinks. 
According to Leonhard Kaiser's letter (Jen. Ausg. [1556], Bd. Ill, 
BI. 447a and BI. 4476, in this volume No. 1086), Michael Stiefel 
was in Jorger's house on March 9, 1527. Likewise, Luther's letter 
to Stiefel of Oct. 8, 1527 (No. 1131) shows that Stiefel was still in 
Tolleth at that time; only later did he leave this place and turn to 
Wittenberg when he was threatened with the death penalty, since 
it was also to be expected in Tolleth that he would carry out the 
general mandate of King Ferdinand issued on Aug. 20, 1527.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! We graciously inform you that we have 
recently sent away a warrior servant, Hans Mohr 1) , 
who has shown us an honorable character and 
conduct, and that he is famous and has been declared 
to be skilled and suitable for the trade for which we 
intend to use him, and that he has been accepted as 
a servant for the rest of his life and has been 
appointed to our city of Coburg. Now we have been 
reported as if he, our appointed and ordained servant, 
should be somewhat attached to the Zwinglian, 
Doctor Carlstadt's and Oecolampadii's doctrine with 
the sacrament, also be opposed to the ceremonies, 
as they are held in our principality, and should also be 
subject to form his opinion of the same in other people 
and to speak of it publicly. We have therefore written 
to our deputies in Coburg and ordered them what they 
should say to the same Moor and forbid him, 
whereupon they have now informed us by their letter 
what they hold against him as for themselves and 
what he should give them in reply, 2) as you will hear 
from the copy enclosed. And it is therefore our 
gracious request that you inform us of your concerns 
in this matter as to what is good for your opinion to be 
done in this matter, so that we may know how to act 
accordingly. You do us a favor. Date.

Edition, Vol. XXII, 1982, contains, as we see from Bindseil's 
colloquia Lutheri, tom. Il, p. 43 f. as well as from the next letter, 
Luther's verdict on Hans Mohr. - Compare also Melanchthon's 
letter to Balthasar Thiring, preacher at Coburg, of Nov. 18, 1527 
(Corp. Ref., vol. |, 910 f.), in which he tells him how he should 
behave against Mohr. 

2) According to the letter of the councilors of Monday after New 
Year's Day [Jan. 6]? 9 Mohr said: he does not intend a secret 
mutiny, but that he cannot allow himself to be bound, if he is in 
revels and collation and half of the things of the sacrament are 
spoken of by others, that he should not confess his faith 2c. for it 
is ever unjust to make of the creature in the Lord's bread and wine 
that which is the Creator Himself, and to pity that the poor people 
should be so miserably deceived in these things. (Burkhardt I. c.)

Martin Landmann an. Luther. 
(Regest.) 

Martin Landmann, who seems to be a tax or accounting official, 
apologizes that because of his official business he could not, as 
he had promised, come to Wittenberg shortly for the sake of the 
prisoners (among whom will have been his adulterous wife). 
Therefore he asks Luther, out of Christian love, to take care of 
the prisoners, his compatriots (proprios). He informs that his 
adulterous wife had been seduced by gifts, whose parents, bribed 
by the adulterer, had delivered her to shame themselves. 
Therefore, he considers the still young woman innocent, he 
laments for her, and if he could, he would help to free her, and, if 
she would be provided with some of the adulterer's goods, he 
would forsake his right out of love, take her back to himself and 
live with her. Therefore, Luther should try to persuade the head 
of the city and the great ones to accept this and to set her free. - 
Nothing else is known about this matter.

29:9]: "If a godly man comes to deal with a fool, he

No. 1189. 
(Wittenberg.) (January 24, 1528.) 


Luther's concerns in the Einsiedel case. 
Supplement to the previous letter. 


This concern is found in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, 
p. 247.d; in the Jena edition (1566), vol. IV, p. 315; in the 
Altenburg edition, vol. IV, p. 369; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XIX, 
p. 662; in Walch, vol. XXI, 227; in Kapp's Nachlese, vol. I, p. 102 
(from the original); in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 269 and in the Erlangen 
edition, vol. 53, p. 427. 

Because Duke George puts on his head, my concern 
is, he acts like diabolus incarnatus, until one goes right 
and clear under his eyes, does not cease to ask the von 
Einsiedel conscience 2c. Therefore, there is little advice 
against violence; as much as | can, | show. 


1088 


First of all, that they will take a life and limb for 
themselves and decide that they do not want to grant or 
accept any of the things that Duke George puts out for 
them, and especially not the absolution 1). And next, 
because it is God's business and concerns the soul, that 
they cheerfully call upon God for counsel and help, and 
not doubt that He will hear and help. 

Secondly, to make their reply, it would be good that 
the apology they made on five pieces, as recorded in the 
10th and 11th sheet, be taken again and crossed out in 
fine words, to the same extent: the von Einsiedel would 
have provided themselves humbly, H.F.G. would have 
sufficiently heard their innocence from such reply, when 
H.F.G. himself found on the same that they are without 
reason and cause to indicate to H.F.G.; and also hoped 
to stand against Imperial Majesty himself with it, as in 
which mandate alone assault is forbidden 2c. and no 


Letters from the year 1528. No. 1189. 





assault is found here in the five pieces. Majesty himself 
with this, as in which mandate alone the offence is 
forbidden 2c., and here in the five pieces no offence is| 
found. Therefore they still hoped that H. F. G. should 
leave them at it, and not yet go higher than Imperial 
Majesty's mandate demands. Majesty's mandate 
demands. 

Thirdly, if they did not find any physical violation, they 
would not be able to confess their disobedience with al 
good conscience and have it absolved: since God himself 
would know well to think that one cannot sin with a good 
conscience if there is no sin; for God would be mocked 
by it if one sought forgiveness in his sacrament if one has 
no sin or confesses it. 

Thirdly, that they humbly ask the Lord to leave thein 
conscience and person free and uncoerced. For they| 
should graciously request that faith be free and 
uncoerced, or else it is completely contrary to God, and 
both he who compels and he who allows himself to be 
compelled sin. For they both mock God, because the} 
heart is not there with the glow of a free conscience. 

It would undoubtedly do S. F. G. itself no favors where 
a foreign prince wanted to force S. F. G. subjects into his} 


1) Namely, "from the bishop, as the highest prelate. See the| 
introduction to No. 1161. 





1089 


Make them listen. Now, however, conscience and faith 
alone are subject to God, and are not to be subject to any 
power on earth or in heaven: the S. F. G. must consider 
that the von Einsiedel not only for the sake of their souls, 
but also for the sake of the S. F. G. , as they want to reach 
out and take hold of the eternal God's kingdom and 
power; for they would complain of both their own and 
other people's sins before God, because they have acted 
against His divine commandment by letting other people 
rule in His kingdom and conscience. And although the 
conscience of Einsiedeln would be wrong and erroneous, 
yet St. Paul has forbidden Rom. 14 [22] to do and act 
against such conscience. Therefore, they humbly request 
that H.F.G. graciously accept their humble request, for 
they, with body and soul, as true, faithful subjects, are 
due to H.F.G., as true, proper superiors, always gladly 
obedient 2c. And S. F. G. wanted to be moved that S. F. 
G. would not be helped by forcing the von Einsiedel to act 
against their conscience, and thus to great sin and 
eternal damnation of their souls, since Paul also 
condemns those Réln. 14 [23], who act against their 
wrong and false conscience. 

Fourthly, they would like to include this, because the 
full Einsiedel are probably feudatories of two princes; so 
they know neither before the world nor before God to 
answer for that they should surrender and join the one 
part so completely. For since the persons would be 
entangled, they would then also have to do in the other 
principality according to the will of H.F.G., which would 
then also be in secular foreign sovereignty. How to do 
this (for | do not understand myself highly in this), that 
one may well show him how S. F. G. is half the part, and 
not the whole lord over the von Einsiedel person, 
therefore they can give their person in this as little without 
the other lord's knowledge and will completely, as in other 
services, Frohnen 2c. 

They asked for it, and hoped comfortingly that H. F. 
G. would not force them there, so that they would gain 
disfavor with the other part, or even do too much to the 
same rule. And since it is certain that H. George will not 
be able to resist the seven

Whether the same pastor keeps himself right 2c. in

because without doubt there is a difference between 
parish masses and purchased masses 2c. It will not do 
so, to hold masses without necessity, that is, if there are

Christ. 

Whether such a priest could teach common 
ceremonies in the villages, at the Holy Celebration, Latin 
Mass 2c., and in addition: that all goes well, unless the 
Masses are without communicants, and the Holy 
Celebration is not held in the papal manner, to plague the 
saints. But for the sake of the sacrament, they know no 
way, unless the same priest could forbid the one who 
uses both forms in confession to seek elsewhere. If a 
Christian priest wants to and can do so, let him do so; for 
no one is to be forced to believe. 

If there were some parishioners who had not received 
the sacrament before in both forms, or who had received 
it completely, they would come to the same priest and 
ask for one form: whether he could give it with a clear 
conscience, especially because the Word of God had 
been carried to the fourth year, after which the people 
would be. For where it would be pure weakness, it would

Luther's further concerns in the Einsiedel case. 
Because the other Einsiedel acts given by Kapp do not give 


any clue for a more exact dating, we also put this concern here, 
as all other editions do. 


D. M. L. for the fifth, inter alia. 

If the subjects are to appoint a priest, they must not 
appoint an unchristian one, but a righteous one: 
otherwise they would be guilty of a sin of another, as if 
they had knowingly shown support and counsel. 

Where the priest is not righteous, it does not help that 
he should act as he knows to answer to God, because 
they have helped the unchristian priest. 

It is also not particularly the case if a subject goes to 
the churches in haste, since ungodly preaching and 
ceremonies are conducted inside; for it is recorded in the 
other book of Kings, in the fifth chapter [v. 18], that the 
Naaman Syrus went with his king of Syria to the temple 
of Rammon 2c.

Grace and peace! | am glad that you have seen Martin 
Cellarius and have now also read him, my dear Amsdorf; 
| knew that you would pass such a judgment on him. Satan 
rages in those people that they do not think or think 
anything certain, so that he may also disturb others 
through them. Christ keep us. Amen. There is nothing new

he had been invented without stubbornness. For since 
there are people available who are both fit and poor, why 
should one not be allowed or willing to appoint one of 
them? Especially since this Balthasar does not like to 
accept, both for his own sake and for that of his wife; 
therefore, | think, one should let him go freely wherever 
he wants and take another in his place. 

The visitation is under the press, through which, 
hope, everything will be changed for the better. 

Your preacher has a bad rumor among us, as if he 
despises your reputation and, puffed up by trusting in the 
applause of the mob, takes too much liberty and is 
insolent. | write about this both to the council and to 
himself, | also write to your reverence (tuae Dfignatatt)). 
See, therefore, that he teaches quietly and punishes the 
infirmities without noise, lest, if you are negligent, we be 
compelled to invoke the hand of the prince against him 
and his. | will take zero blame if you do not dare to do so, 
and work with the prince to remove him from the city if he 
does not begin to act more prudently; for what is he doing 
stirring up trouble in the midst of trouble and carrying fire 
to fire? This you shall read to him and say in my name, 
that is, sharply and openly, and confidently you shall 
provoke his anger against me, and apologize, because | 
do not have this from you, which | write, and | wonder that 
you have kept silent so long and kept behind the 
mountain. Farewell in Christ, my man venerable in Christ. 





His brother Paul, who is extremely dear in Christ, the 
zealous and diligent preacher of the church in 
Zwickau. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord! | have also asked 
you before, dear Mr. Paul, by letter 1) that you should 
teach the word of God peacefully, and abstain from 
persons and everything that tends to move the people 
without benefit. Now a sad and unpleasant rumor about 
you shows me anew what | would rather not have heard, 
and not only the rumor, but also N. Stephan Roth through 
his letters; although dark, he has nevertheless shown so 
much that it is enough to arouse my concern, which, as it 
suspects all evils in a few evils, so also fears in all things 
that are certain. In short, since you teach in this way that 
you seriously offend blameless and godly men, this is a 
great proof that you do not walk rightly according to the 
Gospel, but aim to cause either riots or mobs for your 
glory. Yes, that you teach about the sacrament so coldly 
and that you abstain from communion yourself for so long, 
who should not rightly think that you might be planning 
some monstrosity? 

Therefore, my dear brother, | ask you again for the 
sake of Christ JEsu, that you rather calm the minds of the 
listeners than stir them up, and promote love and peace 
between all. It is enough that Satan stirs up unrest and 
riots; let us not also provide weapons for his rage, since 
we should have resisted him with all our strength. You

Kiel. February 21, 1528. 


Wilhelm Pravest, preacher in Kiel, to Luther. 
Pravest writes that many annoying doctrines are imposed on 
Luther as their author, but he and many orthodox Christians 
cannot believe that Luther is to blame. Therefore, he asks Luther 
to tell him what he thinks about the teachings he has given. About 
Melchior Hofmann and his enthusiasm.

Greeting and continuing (tenor), 1) to keep what is 
right and to follow diligently what is for peace. In 
Christ, most reverend Father! Your admirable and 
unusual erudition, with which you are gifted, as many 
praise you, makes you famous in all of Europe; God 
would that so many annoyances had not arisen under 
the name of your teaching, and would still be raised 
daily. Namely, under the cloak of evangelical 
freedom, many careless people add many things that 
have been unheard of from time immemorial, about 
which godly hearts are angry. Although there are 
many who blame you for this, since you are certainly 
the originator of the new teachings in this day and 
age, | cannot believe that all these annoying things 
have come from you or that you approve of them, but 
it is according to the common saying: When bad talk 
arises, the palm tree is also accused of being 
crooked; 2) just as many good orthodox believers 
(catholici) [suffer this] with me, who reverently receive 
and venerate Christ (as is proper) in his Gospel, who 
desire a general reformation of the doctrine of the 
church, 3) in which

3) Pravest, since 1526 preacher at St. Nicolai in Kiel, placed 
there by his monastery, the Augustinian monastery at 
Bordesholm, was one of the natures that had the need of a 
reformation, but only up to a certain point mitgingm. When he 
here with Luther about the riots 





But that everywhere every ecclesiastical custom, and 
that which was handed down by the fathers of the first 
orthodox church (in my opinion) without violation of 
the Gospel, should be destroyed or ridiculed, is not at 
all pleasing to me; as, then, there are people who 
remove the baptismal font from the churches and 
baptize only in a common basin of water, without 
observing any of the traditional ceremonies. Likewise, 
there are those who speak shameful things of the 
reverend sacrament of the altar, who utterly condemn 
the mass, of which the whole church has made use in 
the Roman manner, and turn the people away from 
hearing it, while the common one, which is gathered 
from all quarters, not keeping them evenly, even 
denying faith in the life-giving sacraments of the body 
and blood of Christ, and many such things, which the 
learned rabble in general charge upon thee, as if they 
were introduced into the church of Christ with thy 
consent, or according to thy doctrine 2c. Therefore, 
venerable father, in order that you may advise your 
good name and the common people, | have asked 
you from the bottom of my heart, for the sake of 
Christ's mercy, that you may indicate what is to be 
done in these matters, provided that you will not be 
displeased to let me know through this young man 
what your opinion is about them. For |, the unworthy 
one, have been called and unanimously chosen to 
lead the church in Kiel at this dismal time, and have 
often insisted that | be released from it, but have not 
been able to obtain it until now. Therefore, may you 
advise me, | ask you for God's sake, what | should do 
in these doubts. A certain man 4) has come to us, who 
claims to be a promoter of the Gospel of Christ and 
boasts that he was ordained by God for this purpose, 
and tries to persuade people that everything he says 
is to be received as a law, as a Gospel, and yet the 
man (as he says) 5) understands nothing of the Latin 
language. He 


of some evangelicals, he was already inwardly alienated from the 
cause of the Reformation. No sooner had he received Luther's 
answer than he used it to uphold the Papist essence, even 
spreading mischievous rhymes at Luther. (Erl. Briefw.)

gave permission to preach in Holstein and gave him a position in

been many other things to bring up, but | did not want to

To Spalatin. 


Luther disapproves of the answer given by the Einsiedels to 
Duke George. 


Printed in Aurifaber, vol. Il, p. 370; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 282; 
in Kapp's kleiner Nachlese, vol. |, p. Ill and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VI, 
p. 212. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1090 f. 

Grace and peace! Everything we have done so far in 
the matter of the Einsiedels has been done in vain, my 
dear Spalatin. For their answer, which was handed over 
to the duke by his friends, contains this, namely that the 
Einsiedels want to do everything that pleases Prince 
George, not what pleases God. Namely, this is what Satan 
wanted, since he ordered this line, which is underlined by 
the tyrant with a line, to be eradicated, and they agreed. 
And there can be no doubt that the tyrant understands and 
believes that the hermits have completely recanted and 
denied everything that they have believed until now, as in 
truth they have also denied and recanted. For who can 
suffer that this restriction be forbidden: "as they hope and 
trust in God, that it shall be pleasing to God and their souls’ 
blessedness," and immediately the preceding be added; 
"It shall not displease S. F. G."? 1) This is how a man 
becomes God 
1) Einsiedel's answer can be found in Kapp, Vol. |, p. 136 ff. The 
passage in question (p. 140) reads as follows: "As far as the 


articles of their person are concerned, however, they have not 
understood my opinion.

and Duke George has what he wanted. In addition, she 
[Einsiedel] brings the wisdom of friends and faithful 
advisors! Indeed, | do not know what to advise now. 
/Things are worse than they were before. Their conscience 
s wounded and entangled, for which | am very sorry; how 
safe it would have been if they had straightforwardly and 
openly resisted the tyrant right from the start, while now, 
since they want to take a middle road, as it were, and try 
to keep God's grace and man's grace on both sides, they 
ose both at the same time. The matter must necessarily 
be brought back to this point, so that the tyrant, after this 
ambiguity of the answer has been revealed and 
uncovered, will realize that the hermits do not agree with 
his will that they should deny or revoke the word of Christ. 
How they should do this, | do not know, if they do not want 
to get right with him, or testify by selling their goods that 
they did not want what the tyrant believes to be able to 
nfer from their answer. For it is mocked, as it were, with 
shrewdness of his understanding, in that he hears 
something other than they mean, which is contrary to 
Christian simplicity and truth. This you too can negotiate 
with them and think on good counsel. Fare well in Christ,

Grace and peace in Christ. Strict, honorable, dear 
lord and friend! It is in your answer, given to Duke 
George, too much done in the piece, that the words he 
has underlined are to be let out by your friends. For the 
answer is now just as Duke George desired, that the von 
Einsiedel want to do as he pleases, as you yourselves 
will well notice if you leave such words out and read the 
text one after the other. Now | do not know all your 
opportunities to bring such things back in a good way. 

For since he does not understand your answer, nor 
can he understand it, except as if you wanted to do what 
he wants, then it must truly come out that you believe 
much differently than he means. For your words give him 
a different understanding than you have and want to give 
him. It would still be best to get right with him, or to leave 
the goods. For even though you are now at liberty to sell 
the goods, 2c. | do not see how you can let the prince 
remain in such a delusion, as if you had revoked and 
denied everything. 

So it is also not a danger for you to disown your 
subjects if you sell the goods or leave out the heir, even 
though this would drive the people away from God's 
word; for it is not your fault, and you cannot do anything 
against force, even though there is to be feared discord 
or warfare between the 2) sovereigns. For we do not have 
to do wrong or deny God's word for the sake of any good 
or benefit, be it of the soul or of the body. If only your 
friends had not allowed the words Duke George 
underlined to remain outside, there would be no need for 
any of this. Is this not Satan's evil play, that a Christian 
should not say: | hope to God that | will Keep myself, that} 
it shall be pleasing to God, and the salvation of the soul; 
to whom then shall it be pleasing? Does this not mean to} 
publicly exclude and deny God's grace, and to consider 
man's grace alone? 


1) "the" put by us instead of: "the". 
2) "den" put by us instead of: "dem", because the Churflrst was| 
co-ruler with Duke Georg. 





Therefore, my dear sirs, make such an answer in the 
play be revoked, either by a written instruction to the 
duke, or by the fact that you practice the contradiction, or 
turn away from his authority, or what you and your friends 
may find better; | know no better. May Christ our dear 
Lord strengthen and counsel you to end the matter well, 
for this answer has made it worse than it was before. You 
will find us willing to serve you. Hiemit GOtt befohlen,

love of God. 


3) We hold that altera post here, and everywhere where it is 
only at all relevant, should be resolved by: "the day after" should 
be resolved, not by: "at the assembly after". In all letters from 
June 1525 to April 1530, which are found in the third volume of 
De Wette's collection of letters, altera post occurs, except in this 
place, only twice, namely p. 326 (where De Wette wrote it as 
"Monday after", whereas the Erl. Briefw. as: 7"m day after") and 
p. 515, where De Wette correctly wrote it as: "on the day after", 
the Erl. Briefw., vol. VII, p. 173 as "Mondags and notes, since 
Lucae itself was a Monday: "whereby one must not be disturbed 
by the post"! In the third volume of De Wette, Monday is always 
designated by feria secunda, namely p: 19. 20. 132. 170. 180.

4) The unnamed abbot, in whose name the question was put 
to Luther, was Heino Gottschalk, abbot of Oldenstadt, himself, 
who intended to leave the monastery. As a result of our letter, 
the abbot and the convent handed over their seals and letters to 
the Duke of Brunswick-LUneburg, Ernst the Confessor, on July 
10, 1529, but received from him housing and supplies in the

the truth which is awakened by Christ in the heart of your We have lived like this for a long time, and would have 


dignities, but also for a certain other unnamed abbot, an 
old man who is equally to be revered in Christ, in whose 
name your dignity asks me for advice and consolation in 
the question of conscience. First of all, | thank God, our 
Father, through Christ, who has deigned to glorify his 
word also in this corner and end of the earth, and | pray 
that he may complete what he has begun according to hi 
great mercy, most graciously and abundantly at the sam 
time in you and in all of us, amen. As far as the question 
is concerned, | believe that this man can remain in the 
monastery quite safely, even with great fruit, since the 
situation is such that he is not forced to attend the ungodly 
masses or to do any other work contrary to the faith, and 
he is also free to serve the brothers who either want td 
leave or to remain, He may serve them in Christ, either b 
reading the Scriptures with the brethren, or by praying th 
horas canonicas himself (only that which is impure 
apart from the Psalms and the Scriptures and the 
Collects, must be omitted), and by partaking of the Lord's 
Supper. For what harm could monastic life do where 
freedom of the spirit reigns? Paul has decided that 
Christians can eat with an unbeliever [1 Cor. 10, 27.), 
Cor. 8, even if he himself should eat things sacrificed t 
idols, his conscience is free, at least his. Finally, | woul 
not advise such old men to leave your monastery, first of 
all, because outside they might be a burden to others, and 
hardly people would be found who would care for them ag 
they are worth and need, since now love has grown cold 
in many; in the monastery, however, they are not a burder| 
to anyone, nor do they need the care of others, and 
secondly, they can benefit many others for their salvation 
which they might, yes, certainly not be able to do outside 
Therefore, you will exhort the worthy man to stay where 
he is and do what he does in freedom of spirit, for in thi 
way he will be of much use not to himself but to th 
brethren, then also in the world, and also serve Christ in| 
all things in the most proper way, and desire and expect 
his coming with a happy and sure conscience. For | too 
have a 





lived like this even longer and until today, if the brothers 
and the conditions of the monastery had suffered. The 
grace of Christ be with you all, and pray for us and the 
whole Church of God. Wittenberg, penultimate February

Eisleben.

Morsinus has asked, my dear Agricola, that you either 
send her little Saxons, | don't know which ones she says 
are with you, here, or, because there is a rumor that you 
will come here, bring them here with you. She also asked 
the same with regard to the wages. Ignatius takes that

To Conrad Cordatus in Jachymov. 


Luther invites him to stay with him for the time being until he 
is otherwise provided for; there is nothing to be hoped for in 
Ferdinand's lands. 


Printed in Schutze, Vol. Il, p. 85; in De Wette, Vol. Ill, p. 288 
and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VI, p. 219. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Dearest Cordatus, | 
have already learned that you have returned from Austria 
and that you are staying in Jachymov in hope and on the 
promise of your Queen 1). Furthermore, | had the 
assumption that it would never happen that you would be 
called back by the queen. Therefore, if it is burdensome 
or inconvenient for you to stay there, | would like you not 
to hesitate, but either to hurry to me, or to go wherever it 
pleases you. For if the queen should ever wish to call you 
again, she could just as well find you with us as in 
Joachimsthal. With us you can (as | believe) certainly 
have better and more pleasant company than there with 
those who are not your equals. Of course, if the occasion 
demanded it, | would not turn back to the promise of the 
queen, and nevertheless ask you to enter the service of 
Christ in the meantime. Therefore, it shall be your choice, 
you can come to us with the little sister, your wife, until 
Christ has provided otherwise. The bishops and the 
sacristans, who have been made happy, bold and secure 
by Ferdinand's mandate, will, | expect, hardly allow 
evangelists to arise anew in his realms. 


1) The widowed Queen Mary of Hungary had offered 
Cordatus the prospect of employment in Hungary, and thereupon 
Cordatus had gone back from Liegnitz in Silesia (see No. 1036) 
to Austria, but could not stay there because of the mandate of 
King Ferdinand of August 20, 1527, and went to Joachimsthal. 
From here, probably in response to this letter, he traveled via 
Nuremberg and Jena, where Melanchthon was still at the end of 
March, to Wittenberg. 





men. What should | therefore advise you to let yourself 
be held back by a hope that is not necessary and in fact 
futile? | spoke kindly with the brother's widow and asked 
her to call on my help if she needed it. The plague has 
ceased here by the grace of Christ, now in its third 
month. | believe that you have read my letter against the 
Anabaptists. | hope that through it some can be 
preserved and restored, if Christ gives grace. Other 
things will be communicated to you by our Georg Rorer, 
the extremely dear and faithful servant of Christ. May the

Grace and peace in Christ! When Satan rages, my 
dear Leonhard, he does that which is according to his! 
When Satan rages, he does what is according to his 
office and name, for Scripture reminds us again and 
again that one must expect such things from him. But you 
be a strong man, pray and fight against him in spirit and 
in word. He is mighty in us, who rules in us, praise and 
glory be to God. Now if he should drive you out from 
there, an inn will be open for you with us, as much as 
Christ has given. For there are already several strangers 
staying with us from all sides, who have been driven out 
of Ferdinand's kingdoms, and who at least follow the 
poor Christ in poverty and suffer. | commend myself to 
your prayers and to those of yours. Fare well in the Lord.

this letter, in Austria, but a preacher in Guben in Lower Lusatia 
(see No. 902 and No. 915), which belonged as a Bohemian fief 


to Churbrandenburg. Therefore, Ferdinand's mandate against 
the Reformation could also extend here.

To Mr. Gabriel Didymus, pastor at Torgau. 

Grace and peace! With joy | hear what you write about 
Venice, my dear Gabriel, that they have received the 
word of God; thanks and praise be to God. And you may 
not be moved by the spoons (cochearia) in Torgau, | 
have certainly heard and believe that there are more 
fireplaces in Venice than there are spoons even in Erfurt, 
since many houses have 10, 20, 30 and more fireplaces. 
Again | inform you that Brunswick has also received the 
word, and the council together with your people has 
written and requested our Pomeranian; but it has been 
refused to them, perhaps they will ask for another. Let 
Christ increase his glory. Again, in Halle, one was struck 
with sudden death on Ash Wednesday’ the chaplain of 
the nuns, because he said about the sacrament offered 
to the Knight of Selwitz 1) under both forms: "Pocket God" 
was offered to him. But even so the angry and 
blasphemous people are not moved. The disputation at 
Bern 2) in Switzerland has ended; nothing has been 
accomplished except that the mass has been said, and 
the children on the gaffes are singing that they are freed 
from the baked bread. Zwingli has been led there and 
back by a thousand men as a triumphant and glorious 
emperor, whose end, ruin and disgrace will come in a 
short time; let us only pray diligently. To Sebastian 
Kammermeister you may say my greeting, and that | have 
received what he has sent. 


1) Probably Friedemann von Selmenitz, son of Mrs. Felicitas 
von Selmenitz, who received the sacrament under both forms 
before his death. In a letter of Sept. 18 to Wolfgang von Anhalt, 
the name Selbitz is written.

To Spalatin. 


About the settlement of the dispute between Mihlpfort, mayor 
of Zwickau, and Paul Lindenau, preacher there. 


The Latin text of this letter is missing. A Germanized copy 
(according to Spalatin's inscription) is found in the Weimar 
Archives, Ji, fol. 53 a, 17. Printed in the Leipzig Supplement, p. 
49 ; in Walch, vol. XXI, 239; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 292 and in the 
Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. 440 f. - Burkhardt, p. 132, informs the 
following about the situation from the Acts: According to a 
message that reached the Elector, Lindenau had aroused a great 
deal of displeasure in Zwickau through his sermons. In particular, 
he had taken sides on the pulpit for a man named Hebenstreit 
(who had strangely changed from preaching to baking) and 
against the fellow masters of the same, attacked them harshly as 
well as the mayor Muhlpfort, and let fall unseemly words about 
the family relationships of the latter, namely because of the 
engagement of the son with a rich burgher's daughter. When now 


3) Already Seidemann correctly noted in De Wette, vol. VI, p.

Linden"", the council was prompted to determine the behavior of 
the preacher, while Luther and Melanchthon had already been 
active in settling the matter by letter, then by dispatching 
Friedrich Myconius from Gotha to Zwickau. This did not work in 
the long run. The preacher continued to drag all kinds of 
municipal circumstances into the area of his sermons in order to 
insult the mayor. Luther intervened once again. Even that did not 
help, because the sermon on Thursday before Shrovetide (Feb. 
20) was again full of invective. So the Elector ordered Daniel von 
Feilitzsch, Amtmann zu Vvigtsberg und Plauen, and Spalatin to 
be examined in Zwickau on Friday after Reminiscere (March 13), 
the day mentioned in the beginning of the letter. The 
commissioners did not find the preacher; he had gone to 
Wittenberg. The investigation showed that two parties in the city 
were in hard opposition to each other, and that it was not an easy 
thing for Muhlpfort to dismiss the preacher; they were not yet 
beyond the MUnzian direction, which was expressed here in 
opposition to the council. Luther's letter shows that extreme care 
was taken in this matter. Finally, the visitators removed the 
preacher and appointed Link from Nuremberg to take his place. 

Grace and peace in Christ! The pastor of Zwickau, Mr. 
Niclas Hausmann, together with his preacher, Mr. Paul 
Liudauer, my Spalatin, have come to Wittenberg; on the 
way, however, they say that they have come to know that 
a day 1) has been set on which the matter between Paul 
and Muhlpforten is to be settled, for which deal you, as 
they say, are also required to be a commander. Now | 
take it for granted, because this matter is quite diabolical, 
and both parts are very bitter, and neither part does not 
have the means to accuse and excuse the other, it 
should be best that they are both interrogated in secret 
before someone, whether perhaps the devil might be 
quenched by secret and peculiar means. For if a public 
interrogation should take place by order of my most 
gracious lord, the common people will be aroused as if 
to a spectacle, and the opponents will arm themselves 
and prepare to adorn themselves and destroy each 
other, so that there will be much more evil misfortune and 
evil to fear than ever before, for the devil is the devil, and 
seeks strangely and everywhere the cause of great evil. 
For this reason, | have asked you, with whatever caution 
it may seem to you

takes place, before they have tried themselves 
beforehand in the presence of their pastor with secret

exceedingly bad roads we have had, yet against all hope 
we have made progress, crawling more than traveling 
these entire two days, even though we had certainly 
resolved to have dinner with you today.

prince as soon as you have seen this. For | did not 
receive the letter calling me” until Monday night, and we 
hurried as much as possible, but because of the difficulty 
of the way, the wind and the cold, we could not go any

are very bitter. And | hope that this will happen, that they 
will judge more mildly, especially if Paul henceforth (as 
we have admonished him) proceeds more moderately. 
For | have insisted that if he had to be dismissed at all, it 
would not be good for him to be dismissed with such 
great disgrace, but that one should also take the 
preaching ministry into consideration and let him go with 
honor or even with his consent. Now it is up to you, first 
of all, to move the man to act moderately, then, as you 
have begun, not to leave him with your testimony. For by 
your testimony (you being a pastor) my action and the 
whole matter are greatly supported, so that he may not 
be driven out with shame without your judgment and 
consent, but may at least be borne until he is either 
regarded as improved in the unanimous judgment of all,

To the Respectable, Esteemed, Esteemed and 
Esteemed, My Lord the Elector of Saxony at 
Torgau. Herr des Churfiirsten zu Sachsen Rathen| 
zu Torgau, my favorable lords. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable, highly, 
esteemed, strict, firm, dear gentlemen! We have read the 
affairs of Margarethen, a woman of Eisenach, and take 
care that they be returned to her husband Hans Ehwald, 
a citizen of Eisenach, in the most beneficial way, 
regardless of what has been advised or done by us or 
anyone else up to now. For we are not to defend injustice, 
but confess that we do so. We would have thought, 
however, that the matter would have been established in 
Eisenach by witnesses and good reason. 

For myself, Martinus, | have taught up to now, and | 

would still like to keep it, where | could put it into practice, 
that the clandestina conjugia should not be valid, and 
the other, following ones, which happen publicly, should 
be preferred to the same, unless a casus aequitatis 
would come. But now | cannot make such a thing the law 
of the land, as a single person, | have allowed myself to 
take this and talk it out (although unsatiated), that 
clandestina conjugia should hold and be valid before 
God, as E. A. and G. also indicate and the papal laws 
teach. 
Accordingly, we must (however reluctantly) report the 
imprisoned consciences so that they should always 
consider the first Conjugia as valid before God, 
regardless of whether they are forced in public law to the 
other marriage, as the pope also teaches that a man 
should suffer the excommunication and avoid the country 
with the created before he should stay with the other 
against his conscience. Such injustice (before my eyes) | 
must let go until the clandestina 6on)uZiu be forbidden 
and nullified. Accordingly, it is and shall not be against us, 
where such cases would occur again, that E. A. and strict} 
judges, according to the foro judiciali, judge and pass 
judgment differently than we, who must judge against the} 
forum judiciale according to the foro conscientiae, and 
where the two judgments go against each other. 





that according to the Pabst's doctrine, the person avoids 
the country and thus both judiciis suffice, the judicial 
and conscientiae, with the escape et cessione loci 
tanquum mortuus politicus. f the woman in Eisenach 
would touch her conscience again, as if she had 
nevertheless pledged marriage to Halls Muller in Hesse 
2c., then we pronounce her, according to the pope, to the 
same, and let her go, the forum judiciale, fuga, into 
foreign lands. But the safest thing would be my first and 
first doctrine, that clandestina should be nothing, as they 
are certainly nothing with the uncaptured and free 
consciences. But where are these, because the papacy is 
not thus torn down in such and such a way? Hiemit GOtt 
befehlt, Amen. At Wittenberg, Thursday after

had returned from his journey to Altenburg (No. 1217) via Torgau 
to Wittenberg on March 24, he was summoned again to Torgau 
by a hurried messenger on March 26, where he left on the 27th in 
order to participate in the oral discussions about the information 
given by the Landgrave concerning the revelations delivered by

copies against the sacramentaries 2) to be distributed 
among you. May the Lord grant that they bear fruit among

them, because | see that there is such a great ignorance 
of logic among them that it is impossible, even if they 
were naturally wrong, that they can be instructed or 
brought to the actual point (metam) of refutation. For 
there can be neither teaching nor disputation without 
dialectics, at least not without the natural one, in which 
Zwingli is so unlearned that he can be compared to a 
donkey.

gracious lord! What E. F. G. wrote to our Captain Hails 
Metsch concerning the visitation, | have also heard 
through his reports. And it is true that E. F. G. means it 
very well. But to indicate my humble opinion, methinks 
truly, because our Captain shall not be present, that it will 
be necessary for Mr. Benedict Pauli to be present, 1) 
besides those indicated. There are many monasteries 
present, and in sum, it looks on us and our doings friends 
and enemies, more than on others, that | would have 
thought it best that both Hans Metzsch, Captain, and all 
of us would have remained present, as it began. 

Accordingly, my humble request is that E. F. G. would 
graciously consider how such a change and 
perseverance of the person in this work can be 
troublesome and dangerous enough, and yet, as E. F. G. 
himself indicate, the work hardly suffers. For | am willing 
and obliged to serve F. F. G.. Hiemit GOtt befehlt, Amen.

For the attention of Nicolaus Hausmann, bishop of the 
church at Zwickau. 

Grace and peace in Christ! The cause and affair of 
your Paul is being pursued so fiercely at court, my dear 
Nicolaus, that it seems advisable to me, because you will 
let him go free at a good opportunity. This has increased 
the suspicion that ours, Christian 2) and the town clerk, 
claim that Panlus has poorly defended his cause before 
them, and almost justified the MUhlpfort. Therefore, it is 
safest, in order to prevent other things, that Paul be 
dismissed and go to Wittenberg for a time (as it were to 
me), for | fear that something exceedingly harsh might be 
done by the court against your citizens. Of other things

To the in Christ highly venerable brother, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, bishop of the church at Zwickau, his 
superior. 

Grace and peace! | do not understand anything about 
the formula, which, as you write, you saw with the Knight 
of Planitz, my dear husband; by the way, | have insisted 
enough and still insist that the visitation proceed and be 
carried out in earnest, and | hope that it will be put into 
action immediately after Easter. There is no end to the 
complaining about Paul and the accusations, of which | 
recently wrote you enough from Torgau. They cry out that 
their windows have been broken twice with stones, even 
after our last agreement, so that no other remedy is to be} 
seen than that he, as | have written, leave the place and 
the disturbance. Finally, | ask that you pray to the Lord for 
me, the poor, as | do for you. May the grace of God be 
with you, amen. On the Saturday before Easter [April 11]

Cassel. April 11, 1528. 


Philip of Hesse's response from Luther's expert opinion. 


This is the answer to Luther's concern addressed to Chancellor 
Brick in Pack's case, No. 1220. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. 452, fol. 162, with the inscription: 
"H. Landgraff Philipps zu Hessen schrifft auff D.Luthers 
Bedenken in der Packischen Sache, von dem Landgraffen 
eigenhandig aufgesetzt, so aber in der Canzlei abgeschrieben 
und ihm seine Hand wieder zugestellet worden, wie auBen

| have heard Luther's advice, and | like it in the 
beginning. But | note so much that Doctor Martinus 
does not report the trade sufficiently, after he writes 
that it is not yet verified (vorgewiBt) and unproven. On 
the point is necessary to report the trade that | have 
read and seen it, and also hope, God does not want, 
to bring the original to my hands. ') From

1528. no. 1227. 1228. 





1125 


For this reason, Doctor Martinus can conclude that 
the matter is certain; also for the reason: what would 
| want to do against him, who is my closest friend on 
account of my sister and his daughter, if | did not know 
the certain truth? For | must publicly confess that he 
has helped me much more than the Elector. 3) But | 
am moved by this: God's word, that | would not like to 
see it suppressed, because through their actions it 
would not only be suppressed, but also suppressed, 
and all pious people would be hanged, drowned, 
chased away, their own taken away, the books taken 
away, the preachers executed, and what shall | say 
much? They desecrated women and _ children, 
restored idolatry and the preaching of devils, 
spoliated the castes of the poor, desecrated virgins 
and women. 

Now comes the article, where the question arises, 
whether one should allow oneself to be overdrawn, or 
whether one, if we could, [should] perish such by 
God's help? Now Doctor Martinus has argued that 
one has the right and the duty to protect one's 
subjects, as he then has. But | ask Martinus’ kind 
opinion whether it is better that we let the house burn 
and extinguish it, or whether it is better to prevent the 
fire from burning? Secondly, | ask: if a child wants to 
fall into the fire or water of its mother, whether the 
mother should work so long,* until the child falls into 
the fire, or whether she should keep it from falling into 
it? Now I think that Martinus will easily be too modest, 
and perhaps he will laugh at this question that | am 
asking. But if he considers what may follow from it, 
the ruin of country and people, soul and body, then he 
will undoubtedly be right about the matter. 

Thirdly, | say: "Since it is certain that the authorities 
owe it to their subjects to protect them from unlawful 
violence, and also that one brother owes it to another 
to help him when he is in need, so that his life may be 
at stake, | now ask whether | should protect my 
subjects dead or alive, ver- 


2) "to draw out" == to take out. - The Landgrave's sister was 
married to Duke George's eldest son, Johann; George's 
daughter, Christine, was Philip's wife. 

3) This refers to the overthrow of the regent Boyneburg, the 
reinstatement of Philip's mother, Anna, into guardianship and 
liberation from Saxon guardianship (1514), as well as the 
declaration of majority by the emperor (1518) of the landgrave, 
who was only 14 years old, all of which Duke George supported. 

4) "beiten" == wait. The copyist seems not to have known this 
word and therefore to have omitted the same several times, as 
Kolde indicates. - Erl. Briefw.: "beden".

But once again a similar thing: | wanted to punish 
someone so that he would go to the whorehouse, and 
yet | left the whorehouse standing and did not break it 
down. From all this it is easy to judge that one is guilty 
of harm. Another similarity: if someone wanted to 
attack me in the streets, and | knew it for sure, should 
| fight until he threw the merchant down or strangled 
him, or should | do so and defend myself, and if | 
caught him, should | not punish him, because he 
would have wanted that? should | let him do it? No, | 
shall. There is also this: if we wait until they convict us, 
they will take our people, who are serving us now, into 
their hands, so we will not be able to get any people. 
And in addition, our people will become despondent,”) 
so we all do not have a firm place. This is how the air 
is now, so that it can be done with God's help, which 
would be impossible after this; they will also have a 
different regard, so that we will not be able to take their 
suggestions into account, but God may well send it. 
Now | know well that Martinus will say to this: it is 
reason and human suggestions; which is also partly 
true, but he must nevertheless also confess that God 
has given us reason and reflection, so that we should 
also use them for our subjects. For if we were not to 
use human arguments, which are not against God, in 
temporal matters, what would we then be allowed to 
do in the collegia? for much reason is taught in them, 
since God's Word is not within. Thus his, Luther's, 
advice is not at all without reason and worldly wisdom. 
But he will meet me: one should forgive God. 





1) So Kolde. Erl. Briefw.: "verjagt". 


to God. To all this it may be said: it is no sooner time 
to attack us than it is time to protect us; so | answer: if 
we are sure that they want to kill and strangle our 
subjects and brothers, as we are, then we owe it to 
God, nature and all rights, to prevent harm to body and 
goods of our subjects and to protect the pious, as Paul 
saws Rom. 13, 4., likewise John [1 John 3,16.]: "We 
should lay down our lives for the brethren." Brotherly 
love can do the same, for | would like someone to 
protect me from harm and misfortune and to prevent 
my harm, so | should do it again, and in that case | am 
obligated to protect my brother from the wicked and to 
help him, even if it means life and property. But let it 
not be said that this would become a princely rebellion; 
that cannot be and never will be said with reason. Nor 
do | hope that Martinus will judge me in such a way, 
unheeding my words of caution, after Christ's words 
and Paul's words in his epistles. But | will gladly forgive 
his word. But in order that it may be seen that it cannot 
be called sedition, it takes the form: "We do it not out 
of lust, but out of dire need; if God has commanded us 
the sword to protect the pious, we desire nothing else, 
if they would let us have peace and refrain from their 
evil deeds, and faithfully assure us that we will be safe 
from being struck in the jaws in the future. So we 
desire no more, as our established alliance at Weimar

1512, where he earned his master's degree in late 1516 or early 
1517. At Easter 1517 he became a school rector in Zwickau, and 
at Easter 1520 a school rector in Joachimsthal. In the winter] 
semester of 1523, he registered in Wittenberg and remained there 
until 1528, when he was elected town clerk in Zwickau. In 
Wittenberg, he was active as a writer, translating Luther's writings 
(see St. Louis Edition, Vol. IV, 204, note) and collecting the 
summer and festival sections of the Church Postil (see Luther's 
and Roth's Prefaces to the Church Postil, St. Louis Edition, Vol. 
XI, Col. XLVIII ff.). In 1524, he had married Ursula Kriiger, a sister- 
in-law of the printer Georg Rhau, in Wittenberg, who now refused 
to follow her husband to Zwickau because she allegedly could not 
tolerate the air and water. At the beginning of May, she "fell ill and 
promised Bugenhagen that she would follow her husband when

with you, too, that you have made a tyranny out of the 
Christian servitude in which you are supposed to be of 
use to her by the too great leniency of your mind and have 
strengthened her in it so far that it now seems to be your 
fault, too, that she dares to do all these things against you. 
Certainly, when you noticed that the donkey became 
wanton from the fodder, that is, that your wife became 
unruly because of your indulgence and willfulness, you 
should have been careful that you also obeyed God more 
than your wife, so that you would not allow the authority 
of the husband, which is God's honor, as Paul teaches [1 
Cor. 11:7.], to be despised and trampled underfoot by her. 
For it is enough that this honor of God expresses itself to 
such an extent that it takes on the form of a servant [Phil. 
2, 7.Therefore see to it that you are a man, and bear the 
weakness of your wife in such a way that you do not foster 
and cultivate wickedness, and while you are too much of 
a servant, dishonor the honor of God that is in you by a 
very pernicious example. But it is easy to distinguish 
whether it is weakness or wickedness. Weakness is to be 
borne, wickedness is to be subdued. Weakness brings 
with it a willingness to learn and listen at least once in 
twelve hours; wickedness has a stubbornness in resisting 
and persisting. But where it realizes that wickedness is 
regarded by you as weakness, what is it to wonder if it 
becomes exceedingly wicked? And now, through your 
fault, you open a window for Satan in the wretched little 
vessel, so that he mocks and irritates you according to his 
liking and torments you in every way. You are a man of 
understanding, and the Lord will grant that you 
understand what | am saying; at the same time you will 
realize how gladly | would like it from my heart that you 
and she should be advised. 


After various attempts at mediation, especially on the part of 
Roérer, we meet her again at her husband's on June 21. This 
marital discord also brought Lindenau to the pulpit. The marriage 
seems to have been permanently unhappy due to the obstinacy 
and imperiousness of the wife, of which there is still a testimony 
from the year 1543. She died in November 1544 and Roth 
remarried in January 1546.

But it is up to you to wish him happiness, since Christ has 
taken him away so well equipped and with a blessed end 
from these extremely turbulent times, which will perhaps

others a smell of life unto life [2 Cor. 2:15 ff]. . Blessed be 
my Lord Jesus Christ, who willed that | should be such, 
not that | should be worthy of hope, but that he should 
save many through me from these harmful spirits. Since | 
see that this wish of mine, which | sigh for hourly, is 
fulfilled, | consider myself happy, and that | have received 
abundant fruit and reward for my work, since | know that 
| live for others and serve them. | therefore wish myself 
happiness, not for your praise, which you (as it is wont to 
happen) pour out out of all too great favor, but for the 
truth, to which you bear witness through this simplicity of 
all too great affection and ardor, and most simply confess 
Christ.

His blessings, so that you may remain perfect and

To Johann Lang in Erfurt. 


Luther had expected a long visit to Weimar, but he heard that 
the latter was plagued by all kinds of cunning plots and 
unworthiness. He admonishes him to watch and pray against the} 
ravages of Satan. - Otherwise, this letter contains several dar 
points for us.

1) The editions place this letter in the year 1523, but this cannot 
be correct because Lang married the widow of the white tanne 
Heinrich Mattern only in 1524, not in 1522, as Erhard, Ueberlief. ||

previous letter, that no one from Erfurt had visited him in such 
close proximity, leads to the year 1528 (see Erl. Briefw., Vol. VI, p 
258). 

2) Is it certain that this happened by death or is it about othe 
circumstances? We would like to assume the latter, and then refe 
"the thunderclap" to the unexpected occurrence of the same. 
Luther's warning to be careful with regard to "polygamy" could also 
be aimed in this direction. On Oct. 28, 1529, Luther greets the little 
son Langs together with his mother. 

3) De Wette points fulminis to the anger and malice of the 
enemies of the Gospel; Walch translates: "of your banishing ray"

Letters from the year 


My conscience knows that you have obtained the letter 
from me in an unworthy manner and with deceitful words, 
and that | would not have written like this to an enemy of 
the Gospel if | had not been deceived, which | have 
already testified with yours, and if you do not desist, | will 
publicly announce your unworthiness to the whole world. 
It may be that | did not want Melchior 1) to be stormy, but 
| believed you to be a calm and pure teacher of the Word, 
so that | was much less willing to incite and encourage 
you, who rage and rage against the ministers of the Word 
(even if they are somewhat too restless), but rather to 
admonish and restrain you, if | had known that you were 
an enemy. | am indeed surprised that it can amuse you 
frivolous papists to pursue your cause with deceit and 
lies. Rather, finally, be ashamed that you can do nothing 
but deceive and lie in your cause, as if the light will not 
also dispel the darkness. There you have what this 
admonition of mine is intended for; so, if you are wise, 
desist from this kind of mischievousness against us, 
which you will not succeed in, and let the word of God 
take its course. 2) | have seen your poisonous rhymes 
written against me, but if you continue, they will fall back 
on your head. Be well and repent. On Saturday after

4) Instead of: "allich wol", Krafft reads: "allyehwol". In Walch's 
High German translation: "gleich gut". 

5) That is: because one should and must drive neatly in this. 
Instead of this Walch offers: "because one should also drive 
cleanly with you". 

6) So Krafft certainly right. In the editions: "will", "ji willen" - you 
will. 

7) Krafft: "hyr mede" (== hiemit), in the editions: "hor mede". - 
Immediately following Walch has resolved "demsulven" (== the 
same) by: "an den saubern".

To Conrad Wulf, citizen of Kiel. 


Luther told Conrad Wulf, who had reported Pravest's behavior 
to him, that he had written a harsh letter to Pravest, of which he 
hoped that he would not praise it as much as the first one. The 
preachers should be exhorted to teach quietly and not stormily. 


Printed in Krafst, Zweifaches JubelgedachtniB, p. 448; in 
Krohn, Geschichte der Wiedertaufer, p. 119 and in Erl. Briefw., 
vol. VI, p. 261 f. in Lower Saxon. Walch, vol. XXI, 1102, also gives 
this letter in a new High German translation. In De Wette and in 
the Erlangen edition, this Brie is missing. 

To the honorable and wise Conrad Wulffen, citizen of 

Kiel, my favorable friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable good friend! | 
have written a hard letter to your (jwen == juen) pastor for 
the sake of his lies, so that he has deceived me, that | 
truly did not know nor understand otherwise, because he 
was one of the best friends of the gospel [one] so good 
words he gave me. Now | hear, and have read his rhymes 
and poems against me, | see well how he sought and 
meant me with falsehood. Since | am now well assured 
that he will not carry around and praise this other letter of 
mine as he does with the first one, my friendly request to 
you (Jw) is that you help excuse me and, where he will 
praise the first letter 1), announce that he will also praise 
the other one, so that it will be seen what kind of man he 
is, and publicly point out to him and everyone by my 
handwriting. Besides, exhort your preachers also, 2) that 
they teach the gospel neatly and with quietness, not with 
rumbling, breaking, and tempests, for in time even that 
which is unrighteous will fall, where the hearts are well 
and truly taught and instructed beforehand. Christ our 
Lord be with you all, amen. At Wittenberg, on the

ridiculed it may be by those. For who can shut Satan's 
mouth that he should not at least talk where he cannot 
talk? Pray with your own for us, my dear man, for Satan 
is raging in the world, who, not content with destroying 
souls, is not satisfied.

Since in this letter an embassy to the Imperial Regiment at Speier 
and King Ferdinand is requested, and the mandate issued as a 
result of this eaten is dated May 20, our letter must have been 
written before this date. Furthermore, it presupposes the personal 
presence of the theologians with the Elector. They were probably 
summoned to Torgau on May 14, where the Elector was preparing 
to leave for Weimar on May 15. In moray, they drew up our report 
on the 15th, and it was sent to the Elector, who had left in the 
meantime. On the same day, they returned to Wittenberg.

C. F. G. will know how to handle the matters that now 
come up, we cannot refrain from asking and encouraging 
E. C. F. G. out of our just and guilty concern for E. C. F. 
G., we must not refrain from humbly begging and 
admonishing E. C. F. G., because we will be moving from 
house to house today, 1) and immediately leave behind 
us a reminder that E. C. F. G. is attacking us every hour 
with a great deal of business, and that Satan is also 
cunningly seeking us, so that we will reluctantly, or ever 
so slowly, pursue and accept peace. 

First, because God presents us with such good means 
and causes to keep the peace that C.F.G. will not fail to 
do so;

you not to accept the grace of God in vain 2c., and to 
send the most favorable message both to the imperial

the glimpse. 

On the other hand, that M. G. Lord, the landgrave, be 
stopped, that S. F. G. does not hurry too much and does 
not negate such divine means 2) and scatter, as one is 
wont to fish before the sea. 

Thirdly, not to insist so hard on the food and to seek it 
carefully, because it is better to lose so much money than 
to incur so great an expense annually. How would one 
do otherwise, if so much damage would have come by 
fire or water or other accident, as happened in the beastly 
riot 2c.? May Christ, our Lord, enlighten and strengthen 
the heart of C.F.G. to do His will, amen.

We ask you to accept and help us to keep the peace and 
good means that God offers us. Therefore, we also 
humbly request that you also accept such knocks of our 
God and help us to comply with His divine will, although 
we hope that Your Holiness will know how to do so 
without our admonition. However, since we know that 
Satan creeps around us as St. Peter speaks, and cannot 
stand that one has or seeks peace, we must worry that 
he would now also bring so much business before us, or 
hinder, that such knocking on God's door would be 
neglected and abandoned. Therefore, we consider it 
best, 2) first, that a message be dispatched in the most 
expedient manner both to the Regiment of Imperial 
Majesty and to the King. Majesty, and to the Royal 
Majesty at Behemoth, so that obedience would have to 
be felt, and glimpses would be given to us, but 
displeasure would be driven to the rebellious princes. On 
the other hand, that the Landgrave be restrained so that 
H.F.G. does not destroy such means and fugues for 
peace, and that for the sake of God, who presents us with 
such beautiful means and does not want to have them 
despised. Thirdly, not to demand the food so sharply; for 
God has more than the food, and can bring it in again, if 
one follows His divine admonition and means, 3) and 
does not despise them. Christ, our Lord, tread Satan 
under E. F. G.'s feet soon, amen.

Grace and peace in the Lord! The pastor in Schlettau, 
Mr. Balthasar,*) has decided to leave his parish for the

Luther and Melanchthon to the Elector 
John of Saxony. 


On the arrival of a mandate from the imperial regiment at 
Speier, which commands peace to all estates, Luther and 
Melanchthon earnestly exhort to peace, and propose that an 
envoy be sent to the imperial regiment to report the obedience of 
the Elector and the Landgrave, and to sue the federal princes. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 29. Printed 
in the Leipzig Supplement, p. 51, No.67; in Walch, vol. XXI, 247; 
in De Wette, vol. Ill, p.332 and in the Erl. This letter, as is evident 
from its beginning, is written one day after the arrival of the 
imperial mandate, which is already mentioned in a letter of 
Melanchthon to the Elector (Corp. Ref., Vol. 1,979) on May 18. 
The mandate cannot have arrived before May 15, for in that case 
it would have become known to the theologians already when 
they were present in Torgau. Therefore, only May 16 and 17 
remain for our letter. The 16th is the more probable day, because 
the theologians in No. 1248 already answer a letter of the Elector 
written to them for this reason.

John, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c, Landgrave of

yesterday a mandate from the regiment in kaiserl. 
Majesty. In it peace is offered to all the states of the empire, 
which we are not a little pleased about, as we hope of our 
small understanding, it should be a beautiful, good cause to 
find the peace that we seek and desire. And it seems to us 
that God hears our prayer and will graciously be with us, for 
he truly greets us kindly, where we can answer him and 
receive him well; for such a cause, which comes to us from 
himself, we should have sought far and wide. 

And whether it may or may not be that the princes of 
the Confederation would have issued such a mandate 
themselves; nevertheless, it is not the less a good 
approach to act with them or against them in the regiment 
for peace 2c. 

Therefore, it is our humble concern (although E. C. F. 
G., according to high princely understanding, does not 
need our advice) that such an imperial mandate should 
not be despised: 

First, so that God Himself, who graciously shows 
Himself to be at peace, will not be despised in it. 

On the other hand, such a mandate has ever come 
from our duly appointed authority of God, to which 
obedience is owed, especially because there is nothing 
evil, but only good and peace commanded, and not ours 
or theirs, but the common good of the realm is sought 
and offered to us. 2c. For we fear that, if such a mandate 
were to be disregarded or thrown to the winds, the 
princes of the Confederation would thereby make a great 
pretence and bring disgrace, and on our part cause the 
greatest disgrace in the eyes of all the world, as those 
who offered themselves for peace, and to be subjects of 
Imperial Majesty. Majesty's subjects, and are insulted 
over such obedience by the disobedient, as rebels 
against Imperial Majesty. Majesty, and would be 
punished by crimen laesae majestatis on us. 
bring 

In addition, they would of course continue to act with 
the said regiment, and they would obtain a respect, and 
then our part's cause would come to the point that it 
would keep no good conscience before God, no right 
before the kingdom, no glimpse before the world, which 
should be quite terrible and cruel. 


And we fear that Satan has greater things in mind than 
we think, for he does not want to attack the gospel 
piecemeal, but, just as Haman wanted to wipe out the 
entire Jewish race, he also wants to turn the whole of 
Germany around and thus wipe out the gospel. It is not 
for nothing that he is so diligent about us, fights and fights 
back, that we are hard and industrious, even lazy and 
unwilling to seek and accept the peace that God gives us 
and offers us. 

E. C. F. G. will undoubtedly think for themselves what 
an unfortunate thing it should be, if all things had been 
well thought out and arranged, if so much bloodshed had 
been committed against conscience and _ imperial 
majesty without need. Majesty had been committed. 

And, since God is for, if it should be carried out and 
executed in such an evil conscience and disobedience, it 
should be eternally lamentable to us that we would then 
have to and would be forced to speak against E.C.F.G., 
as our most beloved Lord, by whom we have been so 
fatherly and warmly nourished, protected and showered 
with excellent great benefits and graces, speak and 
testify to this, as | have conditioned Martinus before C. F. 
G. at Altenburg, that we must avoid C. F. G.'s land and 
commit ourselves for the sake of the Gospel, lest all such 
disgrace fall on that same innocent word of God with a 
good appearance. What could happen to our hearts more 
and more, than that we would have to be separated from 
such a father and patron, and perhaps many other fine 
people with us. The devil certainly has such and even 
greater misery in mind, which God now graciously tries 
to prevent, with such a cause, which one would perhaps 
later like to pay for with a land, and will then be nowhere 
to be had. 

So we cannot think how our part should not be 
considered with all fairness in the eyes of the world, as 
those who prefer war to peace, bloodshed to good 
governance; which suspicion we, as those who have and 
praise God's word, should let be filled from us much 
further than all other princes who do not have God's word 
2c. Therefore our submissive concern would be,

To your godly and fair man, Magister Georg Spalatin, 
Bishop of Altenburg, his brother who is exceedingly 
dear in Christ. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | commend this Melchior 
Frischholz to you, my dear Spalatin. He received your 
letter extremely harshly, which you recently wrote to him, 
in which you accused him of having left an affliction 
behind him in Altenburg and seeking the preaching 
ministry by wandering about. | have excused you as 
much as | could and pardoned the weakness of man; you 
will also (Il ask) bear the weakness of man. For you know 
that poverty is already suspicious in and of itself and has 
a desperate pusillanimity; it takes everything harder than 
it really is, for so it always thinks that it is despised and 
neglected. Therefore, we must have more compassion 
here and close our eyes so that they are not brought to 
despair. You are a wise man and have dealt with many 
people; you will do what is good. Be well with your rib, for 
which | pray that through Christ's blessing it may become 
a mother of children to you.

loses nothing, ventures little, and gains all. Therefore he

seek peace and pursue it", "and you will have good 
days". Christ grant E.*) F. G. to seek peace earnestly, for

do not do. Perhaps God would send a means with the 
tyrant that (it) would be different. But we want to follow 
your concern with ours. But the form that | promised M. 
Spalatino, methinks, should be this; or how you will find 
it better, and change it. 

First of all, that you indicate humbly and with the best 
words you could, how you, S. F. G. obediently, would 
have accepted the articles that were written 2c. But now 
you would have been with people many times, you would 
have had to hear many more troublesome words, both 
from enemies and friends, because of the underlined 
piece, which S. F. G. would have had to leave outside. 
F. G. outside: and yet you did not then notice so sharply 
that such power lay in the same piece. Because now 
everyone worries and tortures your conscience with this, 
and you cannot answer for it, and even feel a burden in 
your conscience, especially because you are reproached 
as if you had clearly denied God and his word in your 
conscience, and, as they say, a Turk and a Jew would 
not have to suffer such a thing, let alone that anyone 
could suffer Christians to hear that someone should deny 
God and his conscience; to which also the more heap 
holds for it, that admittedly E. F. G. himself had not been 
of the opinion to keep or demand such, as the words 
read, but had perhaps at that time, as in the case of 
throwing disgraces on us, been overzealous, but the 
others such E. F. G. so badly. F. G. as badly as we do; 
because our consciences are troubled by this, and we 
also recognize ourselves guilty of saving F. G.'s honor 
and reputation, and yet know nothing with which to do 
so, because the words are so clear that we are stripping 
God and our consciences: we have thought to inform F. 
G. of such a thing. and only to seek advice on what we 
should do in this matter, so that we may not only save 
our conscience, but also E. F. G.'s praiseworthy and 
Christian reputation, both of which are to be highly 
injured, as everyone says, and we also feel this way, and 
so that we do not give the evil mouths cause to 
blaspheme, nor the pious cause to be angry. Hereupon 
we ask that E. F. G. would again overlook the articles 
and give us a gracious answer. 


With such a writing, | hope, the matter shall again 
come into the first season, so that you would again be 
free to wisely keep your conscience.

Grace and peace in Christ! You write me very sad 
things, my dear Frederick, about Draco, 2) but, as he is 
a human being, there is no advice with which | could help 
these things. However, | have written him a (as | think) 
quite harsh letter, whether | would like to do something 
with it. He will write back excuses, but null ones, which, 
as | have written, | do not even want to hear. | also do not 
see what good it will do if the matter is brought to the 
court a hundred times and tackled by the prince's force. 
He has a head; if it is not changed from heaven, there is 
nothing left but for him to sing to us, "Give, give; give, 
give" [Isa. 28:10.]. | think that for the time being this

patience. The Lord be with you, and you pray for me,

1) Due to the Catholic reaction in Erfurt (see No. 1073), 
Menius' position had become increasingly difficult. The 
magistrate denied his appointment; those who had appointed him 
remained silent. Therefore he indicated to the procurators of his 
church that he could no longer serve; they, too, remained silent. 
The magistrate's decision, which had been appealed, did not 
come for weeks. After he had received Luther's decisive consent 
to leave Erfurt, he went to Gotha in August and fed himself there 
for the time being from his eight noble pensioners.

Grace and peace in Christ JEsu, our Redeemer and 
Comforter! | have seen your sentences, dearest brother 
Stephan, which have been shamefully trampled on by 
these Cologne 3) sows, who are certainly quite unworthy 
that they should see such pearls, and | wish you 
happiness that you have been so enlightened by Christ's 
grace that you have recognized and approved such 
things, then also become worthy that you suffer this 
disgrace and such severe imprisonment for such 
teachings. Therefore remember him who said [Luc. 6:22]: 
"Blessed are you when men revile you and reject your 
name as evil because of the Son of Man" 2c. This | write 
briefly and among much business, my dear brother, 
pitying indeed your sufferings, but rejoicing exceedingly 
because of your cause so holy and righteous. O be 
strong, and do not let this confidence fall; despise the 
raging Satan. Christ will be stronger in you than Satan 
was in those people, and we will ask the Father of 
mercies that he who gave you to suffer for his beloved 
Son may give that he may also triumph through you, 
amen, amen. Perhaps more at another time. Now be at 
ease in Christ, who is with you, suffering with you, 
overcoming with you, reigning with you, and making us

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Paul, 
1) formerly imprisoned abbot of Sagan, now 
freedman of Christ, rather free and exceedingly 
faithful servant. 

Grace and peace in Christ JEsu! With sadness | have 
heard, esteemed man, that you too are in danger through 
the error of the Sacramentans, but | pray to Christ that it 
may only be an error and a challenge, as | have heard. 
Therefore, out of brotherly concern, | could not refrain 
from anticipating this infection with this letter, if Christ 
would give grace that you overcome this challenge. And 
| am not surprised that you are challenged. For what is 
easier, and more lasting, and more constant, than that we 
miserable people should be contested, when our 
adversary walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom 
he may devour? But, he says [1 Pet. 5, 9.), "resist him 
firmly in faith." Therefore | beseech thee, for Christ's 
sake, and by the sweet liberty of the Spirit, which the new- 
born gospel hath given us by the ineffable grace of Christ, 
| adjure thee that thou be not so willing a Galatian [Gal. 
1:6.I charge you not to be such a willing Galatian, and not 
to be so soon turned away by these reckless spirits, who 
speak out of their heads without, even against, the 
Scriptures, and, what is most grievous, speak nothing 
certain, nothing constant, but utter a sound without 
understanding, which (as Christ lives) they themselves 
neither understand nor teach. | have seen their writings, 
| have heard their words. Surely it is nothing but a

Therefore, if you absolutely cannot win, at least postpone 
your judgment until you become certain and see the 
proof. You know the curse of the 109. 2) Psalm, "for [Ps. 
5, 10.] in their mouth is nothing certain, their inwardness 
is heartache". But this is said of these spirits with even 
more truth. Christ deliver and keep thee among these

Hungary 2c. Maj. governor in the Holy Roman Empire. 
The two Electors of Trier and Palatinate have acted 
between our dear grandfather Landgrave Phillipsen of 
Hesse and ourselves on the one hand, and the 
Archbishop of Mainz, likewise both bishops of 
Wirzburg and Bamberg on the other hand, for the 
sake of the alliance, and have settled the matter by 
divine grace through their faithful, diligent action and 
application, and by their faithful, diligent actions and 
efforts, that between the two bishops of Wurzburg and 
Bamberg and our grandfather the Landgrave, and us, 
sufficient peace has been made with assurance and 
counter-assurance, 1) so that it shall remain with the 
Speirische Abschied, and each one, as far as the 
Christian faith is concerned, shall and may keep it as 
he hopes to answer to God and Imperial Majesty. Maj. 
to answer for it. Thus a letter has also been sent to the 
Archbishop of Mainz, and we are confident that his 
love will not let their part be lacking. Similarly, both 
Electors, Trier and Palatinate, have kindly asked the 
Landgrave and us to allow their loved ones to act in 
this matter against Margrave Joachim, Elector, and 
Duke Jorgen of Saxony, which our grandfather, the 
Landgrave, and we in our part grant, and we, for our 
part, grant it, and we intend that both their loved ones, 
the Margrave and Duke Jérg, will also agree to it, or if 
not, then so much will be obtained from them, so that 
neither part will have to suffer any misfortune from the 
other. 2) And therefore it is our gracious request that 
you and especially Doctor Martin and Philipp 
Melanchthon admonish yourselves to ask God 
Almighty for the granting of peace, and also to be 
sincerely grateful to Him for such grace and good 
deeds shown. We do not want to let this go unreported 
to you in your gracious opinion, and we are inclined to 
do you good. Date Weimar, Tuesday after Trinity

force the same. Their excuses," as well as those of Duke 
George, prove nothing to me, since it is certain that they 
have done, want to do and still want to do with heart, 
deed, commandment and all zeal what this alliance 
contains in many cases. For they persecute the gospel 
and want our prince dead, we all know that. Furthermore, 
the papists have not boasted in vain and have been 
puffed up and rejoiced, and there are many other things 
that primarily accuse and convict Duke George of being 
guilty of this bloodthirsty alliance or even of being the 
author of it. Therefore my judgment is also that they, who 
are so often admonished in vain, and will hope in vain for 
something themselves, if they should undertake 
something anew, shall be repulsed entirely without 
mercy, because they do not want to suffer peace, but

judges that in it almost nothing is well Germanized, 
ut the piece of the xxxxxxxxx Xxxxx is not only bad,

locations of this letter are given I. c. in the introduction. 

To the equally exceedingly good and godly man, 

Wenceslaus Link, Christ's minister of the Gospel at 
Nuremberg, his brother. 

Grace and peace! You know more news than | can 
write. You see how great movements this alliance of the 
godless princes, which they deny, has caused. But | 
interpret the very cold apology of Duke George 2) almost 
as a confession. But they may deny, excuse, or write 
poetry, | know for certain that this alliance is not a mere 
nothing or a chimera, even though it is an outrageous 
monstrosity. Then the whole world knows that those with 
heart, deed, commandment and extremely persistent 
zeal have tried and done such things and still do. For they’ 
want the gospel to be destroyed, which no one can deny.

[Isa. 16:6], and is not proud according to his strength, as 
he has always done. We will pray against these 
murderers, and so far be forgiven them. If they should do 
something again, we will only ask God, then remind the 
princes that they may be destroyed without mercy, since 
the insatiable bloodsuckers do not want to rest, unless 
they see Germany dripping with blood. 

We are now struggling to translate the Prophets into 
German. Dear God, how great and arduous a work it is 
to force the Hebrew writers to speak German. How they 
resist, since they do not want to leave their Hebrew way 
and follow the German, foreign way, as if a nightingale 
were forced to imitate the cuckoo, whose monotonous 
voice it detests, and to leave its exceedingly dainty song.

my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Honest people have asked 
me to write to C. C. F. G. for a boy, Caspar von Rotleben, 
son of the Count of Schwarzburg. Because his father has 
died, and he is going astray, remains naughty, and C. C. 
F. G. yet otherwise undertook, C. C. F. G. young:: son, 
Duke Ernst Friederichen, to study, that C. C. F. G. will 
graciously accept this boy among others, and at the 
same time let him be educated, considering that he is a 
poor abandoned child, and yet is capable for the studio 
and also otherwise: therefore | humbly ask, E. C. F. G., 
to let him study. C. F. G. to graciously bless the same 
boy, where E. C. F. G. wants to do so, as | am sure that 
C. C. F. G. will graciously show himself in this. Hiemit 
GOtt besohlen, Amen. Monday S. Viti [June 15] 1528.

and thus recognizes and thanks himself too richly 
rewarded; but because he has heard that several 
fiefdoms in Altenburg have been settled, and he would 
like to complete his studies in law until he can use them 
and support himself, he has asked me to prescribe him 
against E. C. F. G., whether E. C. F. G. would graciously 
consider his poverty and need, and let a gracious tax of 
such feudal interest be paid for another two years, 
considering that this would not burden E. C. F. G.'s 
chamber as before, and that such interest is nowhere 
cheaper than to be used for poor people, and especially 
for those who are to study and become skilled people, to 
take care of others, as it was undoubtedly established 
and given in the opinion of old age. But since | know the 
good journeyman almost well, and we are all of an 
honorable nature and special skill, | do not know how to 
refuse him his request, and so | humbly commend him to 
E. C. F. G., who will undoubtedly know how to keep him 
graciously and mercifully, to God's praise and honor. 
Christ be with E. C. F. G. in all the fullness of His graces,

By the Grace of God John, Duke of Saxony and 
Elector. Our greetings first, venerable and reverend, 
dear, devout and faithful! You know how for some 
time there was disorder among the nuns in the 
convent at Cronschwitz. ') However, you will learn 
how things are now everywhere from the writings and 
reports that have been preserved. Since the spit, 
which was previously appointed as a preacher of the 
ends, has turned there outside of our knowledge and 
permission, our gracious request is that you seek a 
learned, pious and honest man, who would serve as 
a preacher in the monastery in question, according to 
the form and occasion of the present life there, and 
send him to us with enclosed letters along with a 
statement of your intentions. We will then prepare the 
same and order it to be duly handled in such a twofold 
manner, and also otherwise, according to your 
concern, if you will indicate it to us, we will show 
ourselves to be duly appointed. We do not want to 
save you from this and do us a gracious favor. Date

1) After six monks from the monastery of the Order of 
Preachers had returned to Cronschwitz in the Peasants' War, 
because of which they had fled, they tried to suspect the Lutheran 
doctrine that had just appeared there and to return the nuns in 
the convent of the virgins there to the old faith. At the same time, 
because of the planned introduction of a Lutheran preacher, 
disputes arose with Heinrich von ReuB d. A. and J., parties 
formed in the monastery itself, until peace was finally restored by 
the appointment of Wolfgang Calixt as preacher and by a (1529,

Grace and peace in Christ! The evil deed of Minkwitz 
2) rightly displeases us all, not only because it is 
committed against worldly justice, but especially 
because it burdens the gospel with a great and new 
hatred; for in this way we innocent people are forced to 
bear the aggravations of others. May Christ grant that the 
end may come and that he may not do more harm. For 
as the matter lies before us, the Margrave is in greater 
danger than Minkwitz, for Minkwitz has armed his castle 
and is ready to take up the Margrave's attack; but he 
himself has gone elsewhere (as they say), perhaps to 
undertake something else in the meantime while the 
Margrave is fighting. And who knows whether (AOtt does 
not begin by this beginning to afflict the margrave 
because of all his quite impudent undertakings, as so far 
there are many of them without end and measure. | ask 
for peace, and would have advised the Margrave 
anything other than war. Everyone says _ that 
Minkwitzen's castle will be impregnable for the margrave 
if the men of war want to defend it faithfully. There you 
have the news that we have. Pray for me, a sinner, and 
be well in Christ. July 20, 1528, at Wittenberg.

omit to inform E. F. G. of my subservient services. | hope,

cannot be without challenge, since Satan does not sleep, 
and | especially wish that Melchior Hofmann 1) will keep 
himself moderate; for | would well like to suffer him to 
leave his preaching until he reports the matter properly. 
Otherwise, that which | have heard from him and which 
he also sends out in print serves no purpose at all and is 
vain poetry, without which one can well know and teach 
what a Christian deserves, which he at least rarely 
touches. Accordingly, my humble admonition that E. F. 
G. should earnestly promote the unity of doctrine, and not 
leave too much room to such rising spirits, is that we have 
enough to learn how to believe in Christ and serve our 
neighbors under the cross, which pieces we understand 
or respect very little (unfortunately), much less prove with 
our work and life,

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear, 
devout, councillors and faithful! You are well aware of 
the way in which we have had a visitation, for which 
you were partly ordered by us, carried out a year ago. 
And although we have always been of the opinion that 
such a visitation should also take place in other places 
of our country and principality, you have nevertheless 
heard in good measure what troublesome things have 
happened for some time, thereby preventing the 
same. However, when we feel from daily reports, 
which occur to us, that there is a great need, through 
the mentioned way of the visitation, to make a further 
insight into the burdensome inaccuracies, which 
occur more and more without interruption and in 
various ways, and yet we also find, where the work is 
not carried out in such a way, that it is beneficial for 
our whole principality, that it is beneficial for the whole 
of our principality, but only one place should be visited 
this 2) year, as it is not convenient nor possible for 
some people to be present and wait for it without 
interruption, for many reasons, so we do not want to 
deprive you of our gracious opinion that we have 
considered to visit the same place in such a way.

so that it may be carried out in four places 1) of our 
principality at the same time, namely, in our county of 
Saxony, together with the following of our Saxon 
offices Heinichen, Duben, Eilenburg, Grimm, and 
Torgau, and that it may be carried out there by you, 
Doctor Martin, together with the provost of 
Wittenberg, Doctor Jonas, or another doctor, 
Hieronymus [Schurf] and Hansen von Taubenheim, 
since we are unable to remove our officials from their 
offices at this time. As we hereby graciously request 
of you, and as you yourselves have previously offered 
in good faith. 

For 2) the other place, in our Voigtlanden, in which 
we want to have drawn the office of Altenburg, and for 
the indicated place visitation, we mean that Magister 
Spalatinus, preacher at Altenburg, and the pastor at 
Zwickau together with our bailiff at Plauen, Daniel von 
Feilitzsch, should be used. However, if you consider 
it good that another preacher should be appointed in 
place of one of the two named 3) preachers, 
especially since there is not the slightest impropriety 
and hard-headedness found in the same place, then 
let us know of another one in their place. 

For the third place, in the distant place of Franconia 
and there it shall be carried out by Doctor Kindt, 
pastor at Eisfeld, and Magister Balthasarn, preacher 
at Coburg, together with one of our officials or 
councilors. 

The fourth place, which has not yet been visited, is 
our Thuringian lands and offices, and for this reason 
we wanted you, Magister Philippus Melanchthon, to 
let yourself be used, as we hereby graciously request 
of you, so we wanted to give you Friederichen 
Mecum, preacher at Gotha, and Justum Menium or 
someone else besides our bailiff at Wartburg or one 
of our councilors. “ But because the necessity

5) In order that the necessity may be ordered by us 
and that what is unseemly or unnecessary may be 
omitted, we request that you diligently follow the 
above order, so that we may have a clear and bright 
command, and that we know how to remember that 
we have previously given such an order, as the copy 
of which is to be found here; 5) so that the necessity 
of us is ordered, and what is unseemly or 
unnecessary is omitted, then we request that you 
diligently review the above of our order, and together 
with it, as touched upon, how and by whom, 6) and 
what you find that should be omitted from the order or 
that should be done in a different way, you should 
change and record it and let us know your concern 
about it. Thus we have had it drawn what our 
councilors and officials, who will be at the visitation in 
each place, and for the sake of the marriage vows, 
are to publicly proclaim on account of our, as the 
secular, authorities, whether the secret vows are to 
be countered thereby and the same, as they occur 
much without interruption, are to be averted; 
Likewise, what the preachers from the pulpits should 
publicly proclaim and announce for the sake of 
magistracies and friendships, degrees and clans, 
because it is considered good that such should not be 
put into the print of the visitation order. But 
furthermore, you, Doctor Martinus and Magister 
Philippus, know that you, together with the pastor of 
Wittenberg, Johann Pommer, are obligated to make 
a safe report of the marriage cases, 7) and to deliver 
it to us, according to which we and our councilors and 
chancellery 


fels and Antonius Musa of Jena. Hausmann, pastor in Zwickau, 
was not among the visitators. For Franconia, where the visitation 
began on Nov. 16, the following were visitators: Kind, Balthasar 
Thiring, the preacher at Coburg, Hans von Sternberg and the 
pastor of Coburg, Paul Bader. For Thuringia, which was divided 
into two districts, the visitators in the district on the Saale (Jena 
2c.), where the visitation began on May 2, 1529, were: Ewald von 
Brandenstein, Christoph von der Planitz, Spalatin and Musa; for 
the other district (Eisenach, Gotha, Weimar): Melanchthon, 
Myconius, Menius, and Christoph von der Planitz. - The 
description given in Seckendorf, Hist. Luth., lid. Il, p. 101 d 
deviates several times from the list found in Burkhardt, Visitat. 

5) This "command" is missing. 

6) The visitation of the year 1527 had covered only three 
Thuringian offices and had been broken off because of the 
plague and the negotiations about the visitation book. 

7) Luther hesitated with it very much; it required again a 
reminder from the Elector, which is dated August 30. Thus the 
matter dragged on from January (see No. 1174) until August.

(Wittenberg.) July 28, 1528. 
To Nicolaus Gerbel in Strasbourg. 


Luther complained with bitter displeasure about the way Bucer 
had distorted Luther's opinion in his Dialogus; of Carlstadt and of 
the Minkwitz feud. 


Manuscript in Dresden, Cod. SolMr, 0 351, fol. 35; in Gotha, 
Cod. LB 28, fol. 33 d and in Copenhagen, Ms. 1393, p. 130. 
Printed in Aurifaber, vol. Il, p. 384d; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 363 
and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VI, p. 312. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 
1114. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have known Bucer's 
unworthiness before enough and above enough, my dear 
Gerbel, so that it is not to be wondered at if he judges my 
sermon (which he cites) 1) against me, in which |, 
following Augustine's opinion, spoke of the flesh of Christ, 
not against, but for the Sacrament, 2) as it is known to 
the whole world that we do not condemn the sayings of 
the Fathers, even though they (in more than one 3) place) 
dispute against each other, if only they are not forced to 
dispute against godliness. In short, if Zwingli had said 
something like this, equity would have been ready to 
interpret it suitably and rightly; because Luther said it, it 
is immediately subjected to the most venomous 
calumnies. Let Christ afflict these vipers and either 
convert them or repay them what they deserve. What 
venom has he not brought about in this last dialogue” ,

4) "Comparison of D. Luther's and his counterpart's discussion 
of the Lord's Supper. Dialogus, that is a friendly conversation. 
Quite close to everything, so D. Luther in his last book, 





he bravely passes by everything that is mine and is a 
mere slanderer! Among other things, he reproaches me 
with the figure of speech of the synecdoche, which | have 
not only not denied in this book of mine, but which | have 
displayed most abundantly. Away with the vipers; Christ 
preserve you (I ask this in the most constant way), who 
dwell among these wild animals, vipers, lionesses, bears, 
almost with greater danger than Daniel in the lion's den. 

Christ maintains a peaceful and unanimous church 
here, then also the academy that flourishes through 
science and studies, so that Satan's belly would burst. 
But Carlstadt, the adder in our bosom, is indeed 
trembling, but does not dare to come to light; God would 
that your swarming spirits would have him as their 
comrade, and that we would be free of him. All our people 
greet you. There is no news here, except that the 
Margrave wants to wage war against a certain knight who 
has invaded his land and committed robbery. Be well with 
your rib, amen. July 28, 1528 Martin Luther.

Grace and peace! We have engaged Margaretha 
Mochin to M. Georg, my dear Amsdorf, and have 
determined that the wedding should be on the day of St. 
Lawrence [Aug. 10]. Since we thought that this would be 
an effective occasion for you to come to us, we invite you

To Nicolaus Hausmann. 


Luther wants to write about the Turkish War and reports the 
death of his daughter. 


Printed by Aurifaber, Vol. Il, p. 385, and in part (concerning 
the death) again, as a special letter, p. 385b; by De Wette, Vol. 
Ill, p. 364 and in Erlanger Briefw., Vol. VI, p. 315 f. German by 
Walch, Vol. XXI, 1116. 

Grace and peace! My little house thanks you for the 
rattle, my dear Nicolaus, of which he boasts and rejoices 
extraordinarily. | have planned to write about the Turkish 
War 1) but it will (| hope) not be useless. My little daughter 
Elisabeth has died to me, 2) it is to be marveled at, how 
a sorrowful, almost feminine heart she has left me, so | 
am moved by lamentation over her; | would never have 
believed before that a fatherly heart could become so soft 
because of children. You pray for me to the Lord; in him 
you will be well. Wittenberg, 1528 August 5. 

Regarding the one which was to be kidnapped by 
Freiberg,® nothing happens, it has been only thoughts, 
therefore you can be calm.

1183 


Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Perhaps E. C. F. G. may be 
surprised, my Lord, that |, a damned heretic, dare not write 
to E. C. F. G., as | should reasonably think that the elements 
and the stars are not particularly favorable to me at E. C. F. 
G., and not without reason. But things and my conscience 
force me to dare such a thing, and | would like to humbly 
ask E. C. F. G. to graciously grant it to me. And first of all, 
God knows that | am not fond of, but almost sorry for the 
mischief that E. C. F. G. is now encountering from Nickel 
voll Minckwitz 2c. But, most gracious lord, | fear that the 
cries from E. C. F. G. are too great in heaven, and among 
others, especially that which E. C. F. G. is doing with the 
poor journeyman Wolff Hornung. And it may be that | am a 
false prophet, God willing, | would also be in such a case! 
But | worry, | say one more thing, that Wolff Hornung is the 
man who brings such things to E. C. F. G., and Nickel von 
Minckwitz must be the poor journeyman's unknowing 
servant and instrument by God's order. Accordingly, to E. 
C. F. G. is my heartfelt request, entreaty and admonition 
that E. C. F. G., when the time comes, show themselves 
differently towards the poor journeyman, so that this game 
will not be a spark by which God intends to light a fire 
against E. C. F. G. For E. C. F. G.. may well mean that, 
although Wolff Hornung is a poor fellow who is despised by 
such a powerful prince, this is also true that, where God 
wants to take care of Wolff Hornung, as he has already 
begun to do, a powerful prince is much less before God than 
Wolff Hornung before a Elector of Brandenburg. For he 
often speaks in the Scriptures that he wants to be the 
protection, judge and father of the poor wretches, and when 
he begins to afflict the great Hansa, he certainly reaches out 
in such a way that one must say that this is a lord who does 
not ask for the defiance or insistence of all princes. Is it now, 
most gracious lord, that God has given E. C. F. G., then the 
beginning is very strong, before which E. C. F. G. may well 
fear and worry. So E. C. F. G. should also be sure that we 
poor heretics have not asked against E. C. F. G. so far. But 
where they

Wolf Hornung to the Electoral Council of 


Brandenburg. 3) 
Hornung sharply rebukes the behavior of the Elector and 
demands his wife, as well as restitution for what he has suffered 
against equity.

was betrayed to the Elector, so that nothing came of it. On March 
1, she found the opportunity to send a secret letter to her sister 
Barbara, the wife of Christian Déring in Wittenberg, in which she 
again asked for a meeting with her husband, and at the end 
commended herself to Luther and thanked him for the many 
good things he had done for her poor husband. But further 
negotiations for a meeting remained unsuccessful, so that 
Hornung finally turned to the electoral councilors and asked them 
for help. In their reply, however, they completely sided with their 
master: the Elector would not prevent the woman from returning 
to him, and he himself was to blame for the failure of the 
meetings 2c. Our letter is the reply to this.

or both and step out of both feet, not limp out of one leg, 
otherwise you might notice it 1) too roughly. 

Thirdly, that S. C. F. G. has not confessed to me that 
they have done or acted something violent or violent to 
me or my housewife, | say that such, if God wills, shall 
become clear and bright before all the world when | bring 
the matter to light; for what will one pretend with empty 
words of much denial? Here | have S. C. F. G's 
handwriting, of which | hereby send you a copy, as | have 
written and sent a letter to S. C. F. G. for a time, from 
which you may not only hear, but also grasp who is a liar 
and an unrighteous man, and whether Your Lordship has 
not done anything offensive or dishonest to my wife. But 
| realize that E. Ch. Gn. 2) is not satisfied with reading 
and writing about it, you also want to hear, sing and say. 
Well then, if the ears are so nearly itching, let them, 
whether God wills it, be herded with it, and | will not turn 
back to S. C. F. G.'s urging or throbbing. For, praise God, 
S. C. F. G. will not be able to do more to me than what is 
right. Force will not do it all. So | still want to find people 
who will take care of my matter and S. C. F. G.'s 
handwriting and make use of it,9) so that everyone can 
see how reasonable it is for me to leave S. C. F. G. 
unattended in such excellent distress of my matters. In 
addition, there is a living heir, namely the son Joachim, 
whom S. C. F. G. has married to my wife; and S. C. F. G. 
is attacking my dwelling, breaking, building, and adding 
one room to another according to S. C. F. G.'s liking. 
Whether this is called in the new German language and 
law: "Nothing wrong has been done to me and my wife", 
this shall not be said and heard by Margrave Joachim or’ 
his advisors, but, if God wills it, by the sun and the stars, 
by stone and wood. 


1) "mécht's" put by us instead of: "mécht". 

2) Here the titulature, as if the letter were addressed to the 
Elector himself, is probably intentional. 

3) These expressions are taken from "ruth" and "feather" (here: 
point), the raising and lowering of boards joined together; the 
meaning is: to make fit, to adjust exactly. 








Lastly, because S. C. F. G. confesses in other letters 
that they know nothing about me, and in this letter of 
yours they let themselves be persuaded that S. C. F. G. 
does not want to hinder me, if | can obtain it from my wife, 
that she turns to me, so my friendly request to you is, will 
you again urge S. C. F. G. to follow his own words and 
keep what they say, namely that they do not hinder my 
wife, but let her turn to me. C. F. G. again that S. C. F. G. 
will follow his own words and keep what they say, namely 
not to hinder my wife, but let her turn to me, especially 
because S. C. F. G. has no other way. C. F. G. has no 
other remedy than the contract, which S. C. F. G. knows 
well, to what appearance he has untruthfully brought me, 
which has subsequently turned out to be so,” which | also 
invalidly respect and hold, can also be proven by S. C. F. 
G.'s letter. C. F. G. letter that the same is incompetent 
and not flush, which would be long to strike out; but if one 
ever wants to have it, then it shall be proven according to 
necessity [as] invalid. Thus, S. C. F. G. is also obligated 
out of his princely office and duty to drive woman and man 
together and keep them together, and whichever part is 
obligated and does not want to, to punish seriously, as 
otherwise all rights, also examples of all princes give that, 
whether the man alone is in debt, as | have not been in 
debt, whether God wills it, the woman is nevertheless also 
driven to him afterwards; if not, then | will notice anew 
from this that S. C. F. G. is not the only one who is in debt 
and does not want to be in debt. C. F. G. not only let her 
princely office stand in the way of my wife, but also once 
again act unjustly towards her and me, as one who 
hinders and sows such a person, who is nevertheless 
free, and whom he should drive to her husband. If it is not 
vain loose words, which you have attributed to me in the 
play, from S. C. F. G.'s command, then you will know well 
to prove for me against S. C. F. G. that | get my wife, and 
besides that also restitution is made to me of that, which 
| suffered against equity. But if these are vain words, they 
will serve me to make the little song all the greater and to 
prove what a liar and a knave Wolf Hornung is. Such my 


4) In the original vow made on March 22, 1525, Hornung was 
forced to add: "that | will never, while | live, address, accept, live 
with, or be with the above-named wife of my marriage, either by 
right or without right, in any way for anything, but will utterly and 
completely renounce, renounce, and forgive her" 2c.

Grace and peace in Christ. In Christ, highly esteemed 
brother Balthasar! 3) This good man, John, has been 
expelled, a man who is known from Franconia* by a 
good testimony and a good name. Since he is called by 
God into the fellowship of the preaching ministry, and he 
has administered it until now, but is now without 
employment, he is looking for a position to carry out this 
ministry. He has therefore thought of traveling to your 
area to see if a position might be open for him. Therefore, 
if you can assist him, you will do so in Christ. 5)

In our prelims: "him". We assume in the original: "jhe". 

2) Also the spelling for "Cyriacus", which is the same here as 
in the previous letter, points to the authorship of Luther. 
Balthasar Thuring (During) was a native of Kénigsberg in 
Franconia, where he already appears in 1516 as vicar at St. 
Urbanskirche; now pastor in Coburg; died in October 1529. 

4) So we believe to translate ex Franconia, not: "ans Franken", 
as the Erl. Cellarius was from Kunstadt in Bohemia, which Luther 
knew well (see No. 181).

The fact that you are asking for an addition to the 
publication of my confession 3) about auricular 
confession, you are asking for something that is not 
necessary. For if we begin to search anxiously, there will 
be no measure of adding, of the keys, of the office of 
preaching, of priestly marriage and many other things, so 
that one could demand a short epitome of theology; but 
if you definitely want to add, then you can use this note, 
which | send enclosed here. You write strange things 
about the Turk; 


1) Henry the Younger of Brunswick set out for Italy with an 
army at the beginning of 1528 to fight for the emperor against the 
French. He advanced as far as the city of Lodi, which he besieged 
in vain. Illness weakened his army and he had to retreat, which 
became very dangerous due to the country people, who were 
now seeking revenge for earlier plundering, so that Heinrich, in 
order to escape the danger, disguised as a common servant, 
secretly escaped with 16 companions to Graubiindten, and 
arrived again in Wolfenbittel at the end of June.

3) Wenceslaus Link organized a separate edition of the last 
part of Luther's great Confession of the Lord's Supper, St. Louis 
edition, vol. XX, 1094, p 509 ff, to which he added a preface. The 
addition on secret confession and absolution, which Luther 
prepared and, as it seems, sent twice to Link - namely, first on 
July 14, St. Louiser Ausg, Vol. X, 1537, § 17 and then with our 
letter - is the following, and (for Link's separate edition) to be 
inserted St. Louiser Ausgabe, Vol. XX, 1102, before § 535: "For 
this reason | think much of the secret confession, because there 
God's word and absolution for the forgiveness of sins is spoken 
secretly, and to each one in particular, and, as often as he wishes, 
he may have such forgiveness or also consolation, counsel and 
report therein, that it is a very dear, useful thing for souls, useful 
thing for souls, provided that no one is forced out of it with laws 
and commandments, but let each one be free to use it for his 
need, when and where he wants, just as it is free to get advice 
and comfort, report or teaching, when and where need or will 
demands; and that not all sins are to be counted or reported, but

hich is probably just a typo. 

6) Luther had not received an answer to the letter No. 1280. On the 
ther hand, Catharina Hornung had sent a messenger, Valentin Graff, 
ith a letter dated August 13 to her husband, in which she wrote that 
he was inclined to get along with him and to formally divorce him. The 

essenger was to continue oral negotiations in Wittenberg. Graff 
eported that Catharina had sworn that she would never return, but 
ould divorce her husband. But Wolf demanded the oath in his 
resence; if it happened in a place where they could meet without 
janger, he would be satisfied. In this sense, Luther wrote the present 
letter, which, however, remained unsuccessful.

Spalatin offered me to write two verses, so far did he 
go in it that he did not want to return without something 


in wuiritinn 


1) In Schitze and De Wette, this letter has the date: "April 8", 
which is in any case wrong, as can be seen from the content. A 
clue for the approximate timing we get from the fact that Spalatin 
was in Wittenberg for two days towards the end of August (Corp. 
Ref., Vol. |, 996 and Luther's letter to Spalatin of Sept. 3), then 
suddenly left and took this letter with him. Knaake assumes that 
Luther wrote fer. 4. post Anastas., and by wrong solution by using 
Anast. episc. (April 1) instead of Anast. mart. (21. Aug.), the date: 
"8. April" was set instead of: "26. August". 

2) These are the initial verses of the medieval school 
grammar, the Doctrinale puerorum of Alexander de Villa Dei 
written around 1209. - Spalatin had asked for two "lines" (vorauf; 
Luther here jokingly takes the other meaning of the word and 
writes the above two "verses". 





Therefore, | have written these two, since he would not 
be satisfied that he would be a living letter au you for me. 
You will therefore hear everything from him. With regard

We have also noted that it was considered good that 
Doctor Jonas, the provost, should be ordered to visit 
Thuringia among others. After we also note that it was 
considered good that Doctor Jonas, provost, should 
be ordered to the visitation in Thuringia along with 
others, we also consider it good for several and 
various reasons that Magister Philipp Melanchthon 
could be used for this. Therefore, we would like to talk 
to him about it and indicate that he would like to be at 
leisure for such a visitation for fourteen days or three 
weeks, in addition to Justo Menio and others 
assigned to him, because, according to our 
understanding, the visitation is to take place in that 
time. And if he will allow us to do so, as we wish, then 
let us know in a favorable manner. We also want to 
send you a recent order and the visitation order, so 
that you may then 1) also do and carry out the 
visitation. In our gracious opinion, we do not want you 
to do this, and do us a gracious favor. Date Weimar,

Printed from Spalatin's papers in Kapp's small Nachlese, vol. 
ll, p. 714 and in Erl. Briefw., Vol. VI, p. 365 f. - Only up to 
Spalatin's signature is this document in Latin, the following in 
German. Answered by Luther on Sept. 8. For the sake of this 
answer, we share the document here. 


Heinrich Einsiedel urgently requests that you 
answer either him or me about this marriage matter. 
For apart from these things, which you 


1) namely in Churkreis, Wittenberg 2c. 


In my letter to Heinrich Einsiedel, H. Einsiedel 
assures me that the younger Aerger still absolutely 
denies that he has promised the girl marriage, but he 
was ready and is still ready to marry the girl, if only 
the father consents, but the father quite stubbornly 
refuses. Therefore, S. Einsiedel asks whether the girl 
should be given to the young man even without the 
will of his father 2) or whether she should be left to 
someone else. Answer therefore, | ask you for the 
sake of Christ, and that is so that a greater evil does 
not occur here. For you see that Satan does not rest 
in these matters. Write again, therefore, venerable 
Doctor, also in regard to this matter, together with the 
Lord Philip, even if only very briefly. G. Spalatin. 


Think piece. 

Heinrich von Einsiedel writes and tells me that 
Aerger's son has let himself be heard against him that 
he is not in denial that he wants to have the virgin; 
there should also be no lack of him, if only his father 
would not be repugnant to him in this, or to be 
persuaded of it. But that he should have promised her 
marriage, he, the von Einsiedel, could not bring out of 
him. 


The old and young Aergers statement. 

Matth. Aerger said, first of all: if the woman can 
make it true that she would have been prevented from 
another marriage by him, then he will suffer what is 
right. 

Secondly, he has also decided that he will not ask 
for it; his son may take it or leave it, he will not refuse 
him, and there is no fault in it; but he does not want it 
in his house. 

Thirdly, he knows that she is not to blame, because 
she is quarrelsome and wicked, and he fears that she 
will not let him have his son when he needs him. 

Fourth, he complains that they have nothing. This 
is a useless sorrow. 

I. Thus he, the old wretch, said before the Lord that 
he would not ask anything about it, his son would take 
it, so he would gladly do his part and help to arrange 
the wedding. The son also said to our lord that he 
would not take an oath, so that he would not be 
accused by others of having taken a false oath 2c. 


2) It is a marriage promise which Brosius Aerger had given to 
Cath. Gockritz, his father's servant, in Janshain (Kapp, p. 710).

(Early September?) 1528. 


Heinrich, von Einsiedel to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


He asks for Luther's concern in a marriage case. Margaretha 
Hofmann is said to have vowed marriage to Pancratius Kupfer 
without the knowledge of her father, but afterwards, with the 
knowledge of her father, a public betrothal of the virgin to Urban 
Kune took place. Before Heinrich von Einsiedel, when Kupfer 
was sued, she denied the engagement with him, but when the 
matter came before the official at Zschillen, she admitted it. When 
she was asked why she had concealed the secret engagement 
in public, she answered that she had not been allowed to say and 
confess it for fear of her father. She asked the official not to reveal 
anything, because her father and brother would kill her. When 
her father and brother were summoned before the official, they 
said that they had not forbidden her anything, but had asked her 
more than once whether she was engaged to someone before; 
then she should have said no [to the new engagement]. This 
official did not want to issue a verdict. However, "recently" 
another official came to Zschillen, to whom Einsiedel turned with 
the request: because the virgin had pledged marriage to the 
copper, and in his opinion she had not had the power to be joined 
to another, because she also had more inclination to the first than 
to the other, and the latter also to her again, the official should 
act so that the first betrothal was carried out. The official does not 
comply with this request, but "urges Pancratius Kupfer with his 
supposed ban" to appear before him and to hear a verdict, "in 
which Kupfer fears and suspects to be divorced from the virgin". 
At his request, Kupfer did not obtain a postponement of the ban 
in order to recover advice from the official. During the various 
interrogations that were conducted with the virgin, she soon 
confessed the first engagement, soon denied it, even under oath, 
but finally, after she had been admonished again, she admitted it 
again. - Now things stand like this: The virgin's father, as a hard 
man, does not want to consent to the first, secret engagement. 
Urban Kune, to whom she is publicly engaged, insists that he 
does not want the virgin. The official pretends that he wants to 
continue with the ban against Kupfer in order to get him away 
from the virgin, and perhaps he also wants to urge the Lord of 
Einsiedel to instruct Kupfer as his subject to settle this matter 
before his so-called spiritual court, since both Kupfer and the 
virgin are in Duke George's principality, who perhaps also wants 
to urge him to do so. Now Luther's advice and concern is desired 
to write again to the present messenger: which of the two above- 
mentioned is entitled to the virgin for a conjugal spouse, 
especially because 


1) It is doubtful whether this is the signature to the preceding 
or the signature to the matrimonial matter discussed in the 
following number. 





the present official at Zschillen has rejected the first betrothal by 
saying that they are to be spouses, also 2) that the public 
betrothal is to be preferred to the secret one. Likewise: What 
Einsiedel and his family should do to get out of this matter. 
Finally, what Einsiedel and his family should do or refrain from 
doing upon the official's further request and demand in Zschillen, 
so that they all act in a Christian manner.

family archive. Printed in Erlanger Briefw., Vol. VI, p. 367.

Spalatin au Luther and Melanchthon. 
(Regest.) 


About the occupation of the parish of Gnanstein. After 
Spalatin has explained the circumstances, he continues: 
"Therefore, it is requested, for the sake of God and His Christ, 
that you, considering their [the von Einsiedel's] so many dangers, 
answer through this messenger, who will return immediately. 
First, what you think should be done. Whether one should allow 
the Count of Leisnig to send a priest to the von Einsiedel? Or that 
the Einsiedel themselves should accept someone? And if it 
seems to you that one should be accepted from the Einsiedel, 
that you send an unmarried, godly and learned man to the 
Einsiedel, who is to be presented by them to the Count of Leisnig. 


From Spalatin's manuscript printed in Kapp's small Nachlese, 
vol. I, p. 159; in Bindseil, Supplementum ad Corp. Ref. 1874, p. 
31 (set in January) and in Erl. Briefw., Vol. VI, p. 371 f. - 
Burkhardt, who gives a regest of this document on p. 131, has 
already recognized that the objection to Spalatin, which we 
communicated on Sept. 8, 1528, is the answer to this, but he 
places both incorrectly in January. In our letter there is a twofold 
clue for the time determination; at the beginning in the words: 
"Now Abraham von Einsiedel has come to talk with Leisnig, as 
the local feudal lord, in past Lent." The fasting began in 1528 on 
February 26. From this it appears that "January" cannot be 
correct. The second time determination is found in the words: "As 
soon as Wednesday after Egidii [Sept. 2] a writing came from the 
count of Leisnig to the Einsiedel." After that our dating.

Now | would like to keep Michael Stiefel in the country, 3) 
considering that he is pious and almost skilled in writing 
and preaching. Where it would please E. C. F. G., some 
of us have considered that it would be good if he were to 
become pastor of the Locha. Locha parish priest, until 
perhaps something else happens; for the good man 
makes him feel as if he were complaining that he is with 
me, and always wants to leave, so that | have enough to 
keep. For | would rather see pious, learned people stay 
around us, otherwise there will be too many of them. If he 
were to become a pastor, one might try whether he would 
also accept the poor abandoned wife, the pastor's wife, 
with two children 4) for God's sake, who is truly in great 
misery, and if misery will henceforth be more, if not, then 
God's will be done; put all this in the home of E. C. F. G. 
and ask for a gracious answer, and ask for a gracious 
answer; but please understand that the name of Michel 
Stiefel is known to E. C. F. G., who was traveling with us 
to Weimar, and E. C. F. G. is a friend of his. C. F. G. gave 
him five guilders 2c. Christ be with E. C. F. G. always,

served at the monastery in Wittenberg for a long time, in

unmarried by L. Sebastian Schmidt of Chemnitz, formerly 
the Lord of Wittenberg, that E. C. F. G. graciously grant 
him and his wife, who now remains well aged and 
heirless, to live in it for the rest of his life. Since the man 
is almost pious and deserving, and may live for a short

therefore humbly ask that E. C. F. G., if it could be, would 
graciously consider his request, as | am sure E. C. F. G. 
will do. God be with E. C. F. G. always, amen. Thursday

After your departure, | wished nothing more than that as 
soon as possible a convenient messenger to you would 
show up, through whom | could get going again with 
mutual letters what was prevented by your sudden 
departure. | am therefore pleased that you have returned 
home safely with your Eva. God would have wished that 
| could have been in contact with you longer, or at least 
that | would have been able to do so more often. The 
visitation has been ordered; the prince has written that 
those who are ordered to do so are to leave soon. 

See to it that you overcome or despise the thoughts 
of weariness with which you are plagued because of 
leaving your office. Christ has called you; yield to him, 
serve him, and conform yourself to his good will; what 
you do you do not know now, but you will know later. It 
is a mere temptation; why you suffer it, you do not know 
sufficiently; we, who are spectators, see it better. 
Therefore, you must believe not yourself, but rather us, 
who speak to you in the Lord and before the Lord; 
indeed, the Lord speaks to you through us, comforting 
and admonishing you. For we have nothing else in mind 
than the honor and the will of the Lord in your profession, 
not our own advantage or anything like that. Yes, itis a 
sure sign that your ministry is not displeasing to God, 
and not unfruitful among men, that you are so contested 
with displeasure against it. For if your ministry were 
displeasing to God, you would rather long for it and seek 
it, as those do who are displeasing to God and go against 
his will, since they are not sent, speaking since they are 
not commanded. Hence it is that Satan regards those 
whom he sees to be pleasing with disgust and weariness 
to retain the office, but incites those whom he sees to be 
displeasing with zeal and impetuosity to obtain the office. 
Therefore, you must be a strong man and heartily 
despise the spirit of displeasure. But ask Christ and he 
will help you; we will pray with you. Fare well in the Lord.

Response to Luther's letters of Sept. 3, No. 1293 and 1294. 


The original concept is in the Weimar Archives. Printed by 
Burkhardt, p. 141 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VI, p. 377. 

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! Your letter, which you have now sent for Ern 
Michel Stiefel, that we wanted to appoint him as 
pastor in Lochau, we have read its contents, and do 
not want to conceal from you that before this letter of 
yours, we were also requested and asked by the 
village authorities to confirm the old Schésser 
Thomas Windisch as pastor. Thereupon we wrote to 
our bailiff there to send him to you and to Magister 
Philipp Melanchthon against Wittenberg, and, if he 
was found by both of you to be sufficiently qualified 
for this after interrogation, it would not be contrary to 
us that he, since he had already been appointed, 
would be accepted and confirmed as_ pastor. 
However, since we would like to have the above- 
mentioned Stiefel in our principality, and since we are 
concerned that the parish with its income in the 
Lochau area might be somewhat too small for him 
according to his skills, and that he would have 
difficulty maintaining it, we would like him to move to 
a different and more convenient location. After the 
visitation starts again shortly, [he] will be able to be 
accommodated and used, on which you will also know 
how to think for yourselves, which we graciously did 
not want you to do. Date. 

When you also asked Jakob Eiseling, who served 
for some time at our monastery in Wittenberg, in 
another letter to let us introduce him to Sebastian 
Schmidt's blessed dwelling, we were also asked 
about this beforehand, and wrote for instruction, 
which we also did not want to leave undisclosed to 
you, date uts.

To the prudent and wise Wilhelm Reiffenstein,

Grace and peace in Christ. Friendly dear brother-in- 
law! You know how God in Scripture [Ps. 68:6] allows 
Himself to boast of a father of orphans and judge of 
widows, of course not without cause, because He knows 
the world so well that it not only relies on the orphans, 
but also persecutes and envies them: as this poor 
Lorenzen Rieber's case well proves, who is so 
completely abandoned by his friends, and is also 
persecuted, that one should be justly hostile to the 
world," flesh and blood before God and men. 

But because God has so richly gifted you that you not 
only confess His word, but also love it, | could not refrain 
from commanding the above-mentioned Lorenzen 
(whom you have now and recently also done well) to 
you, and | ask that you continue to be the father of a 
poor, enfeoffed orphan and help him, so that he may also 
get on his feet. 

| do not think it would displease God if you fell into his 
office and took hold of it, and also supported you to be 
the father of an orphan, yes, it would enlighten him that 
he should communicate such a title to you, because you 
would become the witness to it, by which he would 
become the father of this orphan, and would come to 
such a title and honor through you, so that his fame 
would be confirmed and truly found in the Scriptures; 
how you can mean all this better than | can write. 

So | ask you kindly, because you can serve God with 
words and works to such honor and title to the good 
journeyman for the best, want to prove your Christian 
heart, so that such an example of light shines into the 
North-House darkness, to much improvement; and if the 
darkness would not understand, that they would be 
disgraced by it, Amen. Friday after Aegidii [Sept. 4] Anno

To the venerable man in Christ, Mr. Georg Spalatin, 

your servant of God at the Gospel in Altenburg. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! First of all about the 
marriage matter. Mail must first urge the young man (if it 
cannot be done otherwise), even by an oath, to confess 
whether he has pledged marriage to the girl; if he denies 
it under oath, he must be free, because no one who is 
accused only by a man's mouth may be judged; if he 
should confess, then his father must be summoned, 
especially for this reason, that (as is said) the son has 
prevented her from being married by another. Because 
he should plead paternal authority, he may be told that 
he must have shown the same in negating the son, and 
that he should have prevented his son from harming 
someone else, namely by preventing the marriage; 
therefore he is obliged to restitution and satisfaction. For 
paternal authority should not be against but for the love 
of one's neighbor. If in the one case he has not done what 
he is obliged to do as a father, by which the neighbor has 
been harmed, he must in turn give way in the other case, 
in which he follows his head, and be deprived of his right 
as a father.

But if the parents do not want to grant it, then you can 
let us know if there is still any advice to be found. But it 
would be best if the parents could be persuaded; that 
would be for all of them. For in the same case my most

parents did not want to grant it, he imprisoned and held 
the bride and groom for several days as punishment for 
their disobedience.

1207 





Whether you began to contend with a new doctrine, and 
to assert that faith can be without good works. And this 
thing (he said) thou didst make a show of it, and soldst it 
with a great deal of oratorical artifice and arguing with 
Greek words. But |, who am instructed by the drudgeries 
of Satan, am compelled to fear sure things also, and write 
not only because | promised it, but also to warn thee 
earnestly to take heed of Satan and thy flesh. For thou 
knowest that nothing is sufficient for protection and 
preservation against the wiles of Satan, if | am not always 
guarded anew by heaven, and that in his wiles there is so 
much poison and danger, that from a spark there ariseth 
a conflagration, or, as Paul is wont to say, by a little 
leaven the whole dough is leavened [1 Cor. 5:6]. 
Therefore, in this so great a matter, there is no playing or 
trying, be it ever so little, since this enemy is wont to 
penetrate through the smallest cracks, and does no less 
harm than if he had broken in, since all doors are open. 
This memory, from which you see from which heart it 
arises, take for the best, and | ask you to give me (if you 
have time) news of how this matter stands. For what did 
| fear less than that Oekolampad and Rhegius and others 
would fall? and what do | not fear now for ours here, who 
are the most trusted? It is not to be wondered at that | 
fear also for you, of whom | would least of all like to see 
him depart from us. Fare well in the Lord and greet your 
Elsa with her grapes. The Lord has taken away my Elsa 
so that she would not see any misfortune. September 11,

To the strict and honorable Martin Baumgartner, 
Knights zum Kopffstein, my favorable lord and 
friend in Christo. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Dear, dear Lord, most 
solemn, most honorable one! | have been informed of 
your concern, which is now taking place, because of the 
gospel; 1) | have also seen your scripture, in which you 
desire comfort. May Christ our Lord, who has begun his 
word and work in you, comfort and strengthen you by his 
Spirit, so that you may suffer and do the very best and 
dearest will of God his Father, amen and amen. But you 
know without a doubt that our cause, if we have the word 
of Christ, cannot stand in any other way than that we 
have to suffer hardship and misfortune because of it. It is 
a word of the cross, and it remains a word of the cross. 
That is why it is also called a word of the cross. But St. 
Peter says [1 Petr. 4:12]: "Let it not seem strange or odd 
to us whether such a heat comes against us, because it 
is a temptation, whether we have accepted the word with 
earnestness or not. It has happened to all the saints and 
to the head of all the saints, and we will not have it any 
better if we want to be partakers of grace and life with him 
in any other way [2 Cor. 1:7]. If they called the father of 
the house Beelzebub, how much more his household 
[Matth. 10, 25]. These and many other sayings can 
comfort you, which you will find in abundance in the 
Psalterio, which you must diligently have in your hands, 
read and practice. Let it be enough for us, whether all 
men are enemies to us, that Christ is our friend, who so 
warmly and kindly promises us [Matth. 11, 28 f.]: "Come 
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.

My willing services before. Venerable and highly 
respected, especially dear Mr. Gevatter! Some 
weeks ago D. Carlstadt had a messenger here and 
had a letter 1) sent to me, in which, when | opened it, 
| found a supplication to my most gracious lord, the 
Elector of Saxony, which | humbly sent to his 
electoral graces and also read to his electoral lord. 
And when his churfurstl. G. noted his impropriety and 
that he would not allow himself to be turned away 
from his error, his Elector G. did not want to hear 
anything about the long document and convention 
that he had written to me, as | myself did not know 
how to regard it as good, 2) but ordered me to send 
you such documents to read out and to move, as you 
will find them enclosed. However, since His Lordship 
may not know how the conversation between 
Carlstadt and you is supposed to have been, His 
Lordship has graciously asked you to inform him 
about it and what has happened between you. His 
Elector. G. also wanted to provide you with the 
answer that Magister Georgius Spalatinus gave to 
Carlstadt three years ago, ®

his lordship also desires a copy of them, if you have 
some, and after his lordship has sensed so much from 
his supplication that the Carlstadt of fear, which he 
received from the next peasant outrage, has to some 
extent been forgotten again and has been somewhat 
bold that he might be accepted elsewhere, he will also 
perhaps know, for which reason he also, as you are 
to decide, asks for a farewell. For this reason, his 
Lordship requests that you, after reading and moving 
his writings, indicate your concerns, and what 
Carlstadt should be given in response to them, and 
what you should do and undertake for his sake, as 
well as what you consider to be his intentions and 
requests,*) and send this, along with the above- 
mentioned report of your conversation and action, 
together with Carlstadt's writings, to the appropriate 
embassy. You will do his Lordship a gracious favor. 
As my dear lord and godfather, | did not want to leave 
this undisclosed to you on the order | received, for | 
am quite willing to serve you. Date.

Agricola to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


Agricola answers the letter No. 1300, and apologizes for what 
he should have preached in Altenburg, since he was on the 
journey to Bohemia with the younger Prince of Saxony. After a 
long discussion (three closely printed pages), he summarizes this 
in the following sentences: "| have mainly insisted on three things: 
first, that faith alone justifies man, without our gratifications and 
works; second, that it is blasphemy if one wants to claim that faith 
justifies with works; third, that faith, the gift of the Holy Spirit, is 
something other than the demonstration of faith. Now if these are 
oratorical devices, | will gladly suffer to be called a rhetor, but, | 
hope, a Christian one, and | will rejoice if it be said that | have 
concocted Greek words, since | have preached what the apostle 
himself wrote." (Cf. St. Louis ed., vol. XX, ing., p. 47 b.)

Hamburg be extended beyond Martinmas.

G. and F. in Christ. S., esteemed. F., gn. H. Those at 
Brunswick write here to grant Johann Pomerania another 
year, as they have done to us, and ask us to help them 
obtain it from E. C. F. G.. We ask, however, that E. C. F. 
G. refuse such a request, 1) considering that we cannot 
do without this man, and so far can hardly do without him, 
because in addition to the visitation, our work and 
business increase daily. So, praise God, their cause is 
done, and fine people have gotten enough there, and 
care that they perhaps think to attach and keep him with 
them in time. So there is more to Wittenberg at this time 
than to three Brunswicks. He Johann also complains 
almost very much, as he writes to us, and asks with 
concern that we are working at E. C. F. G., that the 
Brunswick request at E. C. F. G. will not be heard. Thus 
our most humble request is that E. C. F. G. will graciously 
consider our request, as we have no doubt that E. C. F. 
G. will do. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. Friday after

He Johann Pommer also requests, because E. C. F. 
G. have allowed him to be outside until St. Martin's Day, 
and it is impossible to make such a request to Hamburg, 
that E. C. F. G. graciously grant him a longer period of 
time, so that he can satisfy his conscience, that he does

Grace and peace in Christ! It is up to you, my dear 
Wolfgang, to judge in this matter of the man, because if 
the matter is as he says, that his wife has transgressed 
and she has followed the adulterer against his will, then 
he is free. But see that all this is known to the neighbors, 
for the unworthiness of people is extraordinary nowadays, 
which no one can sufficiently believe or guard against. In 
your and the elder Vicar's matter | have certainly acted, 
and | wonder that nothing has been written; that is what 
these noises and preoccupations do at. Court. If the older 
vicar still has no answer, | ask that you both send me

Guben a debt in blood, which he has not been able to 
get with much effort and expense, and yet he is quite 
poor, has nothing else to eat this winter, because his

do a good work of mercy and, considering his poverty, 
pay such a debt from the council's money and give it to 
him, and take the trouble of reminding the citizens, as 
they would owe it to themselves to do so, since they are 
their citizens, and should not suffer anyone to hold their 
own against them, which sin calls to heaven, and is as

humbly request that E. C. F. G. will not be surprised that 
| am writing to E. C. F. G. by printed letter, and that they 
will hear my just cause and excuse. | have now written 
twice in my own handwriting to E. C. F. G., and sent it, 
and would have liked to have put my matter in writing; 
but | have not received an answer, so that | do not need 
to know how it is done. Thirdly, | have also had my 
request submitted verbally by Valtin Grafe, who was then 
made by E. C. F. G. in Wolf Horning's matters, which also

last council invented to address publicly before everyone 
E. C. F. G. by printing. 

It is true that, at the request of Valtin Count, E. C. F. 
G. wrote to my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, 
to present me together with Wolf Horning, as if we had let 
ourselves be heard with disgraceful words, | with 
disgraceful writings, Wolf Horning with my fist, to touch E. 
C. F. G.; and | wanted to be Wolf Horning's counselor. 
Thereupon, S. C. F. G. ordered both of us not to 
undertake any of these things, but to refrain from them; 
all of which would not have been necessary for E. C. F. 
G.. But | will interpret it, in honor of God, as if E. C. F. G. 
had not invented such things maliciously or carelessly. 
For Valtin Grase cannot have applied for such a thing with 
truth; but that E. C. F. G., for the sake of these dwindling 
runs 1), has taken care of the piece for abundance, since 
there is no worry. For | (praise God) have so far not been 
afraid to write disgraceful books; | am also still so skilled 
that | may, as before, affix both my name and the name 
of the person to whom | am writing to the page, and offer 
myself justly, which are not, nor may be called disgraceful 
writing, according to all law. 

And if | had wanted to write defamatory letters, | would 
have been so prudent as to leave nothing of my letter to 
E. C. F. G., or to report my person, but rather, as is the 
way of the blasphemer, to bring the blasphemy to light 





or any other such bad habit. | say this in my apology. 

Thus Wolf Horning, who has been my guest from time 
to time, as a poor, outcast fellow, has been so highly 
graced by God that he has obeyed me and others who 
teach and counsel according to the Gospel, quite 
willingly, and has never been neither willing nor able to 
do anything against E. C. F. G.; even if the country cry 
were true, he would have been justified in doing so by E. 
C. F. G. according to imperial and papal law. C. F. G.; if, 
however, the land cry were true, he would have been able 
to carry out such a thing in accordance with imperial and 
papal law, and there would have been enough people 
who would have offered him money and strength. 

And certainly, if he had ever been willing, E. C. F. G. 
would have long since learned something else from him. 
But |, | say, | have defended myself here, and faithfully 
counseled against, not E. C. F. G.'s beautiful hair, but 
poor people; but especially the Gospel of God, which 
teaches us to command revenge and justice, to suffer 
violence and injustice. That is where it has remained. | 
also promise him that he will let it remain so forever, 
especially because Wolf Horning has already smelled too 
much, whether the matter comes to repentance or not. 
This is for our excuse against my superior and for 
everyone. 

But that | am his advisor is now indicated enough, 


before anyone knew who had done it. In addition, even if| what | have advised him. And if | only knew a lot of good 
| wanted to do it, | would not know with all my heart how |] to advise him further, | would know myself guilty, and 
should write a special defamatory letter from E. C. F. G..| hope that E. C. F. G. would not hold it against me; and if 
The praiseworthy country cry from the armory 2) is| they did hold it against me, they could well mean how 
probably so great that | would not be able to obtain it. That} much | would give to it. But that we come to the point, why 
is why E. C. F. G. might well have overruled me in such]! wrote and knocked, and now knock and write publicly, 
disgrace against my superiority. Nor shall (whether God] is the cause: 
wills it) the world with all princes and kings become so} Wolf Horning is in misery now into his fourth year, 
good to me that | shall have my soul disgraced for its] driven away from wife and child, from house and court, 
sake. from property and honor, from friends and brothers-in- 
law, and no one shall say why? And is also in truth no 
guilt not there, and E. C. F. G. will not hear nor answer 
how much one calls and cries. In addition, two councilors 
have recently written to Wolfen Horning that he should 
leave E. C. F. G. in peace. 3) Such un- 


1) This refers to the Minkwitzian Febde. 

2) In the morning after the first night in which Hornung's wife 
had been out of the house, the Elector told him that she had been 
with the armorer overnight, but the next day the Elector confessed 
to him that she had been with him. 


3) Compare No. 1280 and 1281. 


1216 


Wolf Horning has had to suffer increased hardship, and 
is still suffering. Over this is another trouble, he is a young 
fellow, who hovers in peril of youth and flesh, but can 
neither come to his wife, nor be divorced from her (as is 
proper), that he might start something; must therefore be 
in peril of his conscience every hour and go astray. This 
last piece (I say) is what compels me to write. There | am 
obliged to advise the wretched conscience with what | 
can; but | cannot do otherwise than in such a manner. For 
whether E. C. F. G. is a minor eighth, where Wolf Horning 
remains, we cannot regard it as minor. | want to spare E. 
C. F. G., and still nothing of the country cry and public 
deed and E. C. F. G.'s own letters, but rather rely on the 
next writing of the two councilors. 

E. C. F. G. is obligated by princely sovereignty to keep 
the wife to the husband, and not to suffer that they remain 
from each other without cause. But E. C. F. G. does not 
allow this alone, but approves of such unchristian 
divorce, as the counsel's writing entails; does not 
approve of it alone, but defends it; does not defend it 
alone, but plugs the ears, and calls Horning to silence. 
What will the length become of it? Now this must break 
in the end, that | know for sure. 

Since we have neither authority nor power over E. C. 
F. G. (for such should be done by the bishops, if they 
wanted to be what they boast of), we hold ourselves to 
the duty of love; and first of all we admonish and ask for 
God's sake that E. C. F. G. should let Wolf Horning follow 
his wife and child 1) together with all that is his, and the 
wife also hold to it, as E. C. F. G. owes and she herself 
has often requested. C. F. G. is obliged to do, and she 
herself, the wife, has often requested and asked; or, 
where this should not or cannot be the case, help to 
ensure that a legal and public divorce takes place, so that 
the poor journeyman may come out of the carriage of his 
conscience, and make provision for himself. On the other 
hand, we proclaim to E. C. F. G. the commandment and 
judgment of our all Judge Jesus Christ, who has given 
such to E. C.F. G.. 


1) Wolf Hornung had alittle daughter, Anna, from his marriage. 





Letters from the year 1528. No. 1309. 





1217 


F. G. has the power to command, demands through us, 
and will even judge severely, and commanded us to 
report such in his name (as neighbor to neighbor) to E. 
C.F. G.. 

But we do not want to have an umbrella 2) that a 
writing and power of attorney are sent here in the name 
of the woman, as has now happened. For this will not be 
enough for a public divorce, because we know who has 
written such a document, and if we know, we may not act 
in it with a clear conscience. She herself shall deal with 
him personally. If it turns out that she does not want to go 
to him, we should not be so eager for her, and with a clear 
conscience we want to draw up a letter of divorce. Of 
course, she is not allowed to take care of escort, because 
she does not forfeit anything in the Saxon principality, 
and Wolf Horning, for the sake of his person, has 
previously attributed escort to her. 

If E. C. F. G. does not do so, we will have to suffer; 
but we nevertheless want to warn E. C. F. G. of this and 
have warned him seriously: we do not want to do 
anything offensive or blasphemous, but rather diligently 
ask God, our Father, against E. C. F. G., that he have 
mercy on the imprisoned conscience and bring the 
Elector of Brandenburg to justice, and we certainly want 
to be heard. After that, we will present ourselves before 
God and the world, and publicly disclose E. C. F. G.'s 
own letters and the councilors’ writings, so that Horning's 
cause and conscience will be publicly recognized, and | 
will also gain the ability and space to further advise in his 
cause. However, we want to be justified in all this, even 
before our enemies, so that E. C. F. G. will not have 
cause to denigrate us against our superiors. If we do 
injustice to E. C. F. G., they can only accuse us 
confidently; if we do not answer, we want to suffer our 
right. 

And E. C. F. G. shall know that | have not intruded 
into this matter wantonly. | have been asked from Berlin, 
and immediately from the armory, with high words, since 
| did not yet know where Wolf Horning was, that | should 
help to advise whether one could bring the couple 
together. But | ask God Almighty to let E. C.

Caspar, but not through my fault, because no certain 
claimant demanded the letter, and | had no certain 
messenger. But our Ulrich took this letter to make sure 
that it would be delivered to you. 6) That first disputation 
of the brother (of whom you write that he is now 7) your 
guest) about the hidden works of God is the so-called 
challenge to blasphemy, in which many have perished, 
and | have been in danger more than once to the point of 
death. And what is it that we exceedingly wretched 
people, who cannot yet grasp the rays of the divine 
promise by faith, or grasp the sparks of God's 
commandments by works (both of which He Himself has 
confirmed by words and miraculous signs from heaven), 
nevertheless allow ourselves to be carried away in our 
impurity and weakness to grasp the majesty of the 
sunlight, yes, of the incomprehensible light of God's 
miraculous works? Do we not know that He dwells in a 
light that no one can approach? [1 Tim. 6:16.] And yet we 
approach, rather we presume to approach. Do we not 
know that his judgments are unsearchable? [Rom. 11:33] 
and yet we presume to search them out. And this we do 
before we are penetrated and filled with the rays of the 
promises and the sparks of the commandments, plunging 
with mole's eyes into the majesty of this light, which is 
revealed neither by words nor by signs, but rather is 
hidden and not made known. What is it to wonder if the 
glory crushes us as we explore the majesty? What is it to 
wonder if we, in perverse order of light, ourselves 
perverse, desire the brightest light before the morning 
star? First (as Peter says [2. Ep. 1, 19.]) the morning star 
rises in our hearts, then we will finally see it resting in the 
noonday [Hoh. Lied, 1, 7.]. 

It is true that the inscrutable will of God must be taught

Abyss. Therefore, | keep myself in check with this word of 
Christ, which he said to Peter [John 21:22]: "Follow me 
What is it to thee, if | will that he tarry?" since Peter alsa 
discoursed of a strange work of God that would come ta 
pass with John. And [I restrain myself] by the word td 
Philip, who said [John 14:8, f.], "Show us the Father, and 
it shall be enough for us," whom he restrained by saying 
"Believest thou not that the Father is in me, and | in tha 
Father? He that seeth me seeth the Father also." Namely 
Philip also wanted to see the majesty and mysteries of the 
Father, how GOD was far above Christ by promises and 
commandments. So also the wise man says [Sir. 3, 22. f 
Vulg.]: "Do not seek after things that are too high' for you 
but be constantly mindful of what you are commanded. ' 
And, beloved, supposing that we already knew these 
hidden judgments of God, what fruit could the 
commandments and promises of God still bring us4 
Therefore, watch and tell that man that if he wants to have 
peace of heart and avoid the dangers of blasphemy and 
despair, he should refrain from such thoughts, since he 
certainly knows that they are incomprehensible. Why does 
he let Satan trouble him with such things, which are 
impossible? Just as if someone were concerned with how 
the earth could stand above the waters, so that it would 
not sink, or something like that. But first let him exercise 
faith in the promise and the works of the commandments 
when this is done, he will see if he has to concern himself 
with impossible things. If he does not want to hear this, he 
may see to it that he does not regret it too late, since there 
is no other remedy than to let go of these thoughts 
although it is very difficult to refrain from them because of 
Satan's insistence, for he makes it a necessity td 
investigate these things. Therefore, here one must fight 
with him no less 1) by contempt than with disbelief 
despair, heresy, or any other approach.

That this passage has already been offensive to many others can

temptation. Most of them are mistaken, because they do 
not believe that these thoughts are temptations of Satan; 
therefore, almost no one despises them or fights to 
despise them, even though they are the fiery darts of the 
most evil spirits under heaven [Eph. 6:12, 16]. For by 
them Satan fell out of heaven, wanting to be like the Most 
High and to know all that GOD knew, not satisfied with 
knowing what he needed to know. That is why we have 
to fight by fleeing, and not to think more highly of 
ourselves than is proper, but to think moderately of 
ourselves [Rom. 12:3]; whoever does not do this will be 
defeated. For one cannot think of Christ where these 
thoughts prevail. Thus he brought Adam down by 
challenging him, since a tree was forbidden, with the 
wisdom and the supreme will of God. This is the most 
noble and actually devilish temptation; therefore it is 
enough to be challenged with human temptation. 

With this you can also answer the other question, that 
the preacher may administer his office, which God has 
commanded him to do, and leave in order what God has 
not commanded him to do, namely, to know why one 
hears and another does not. What is it to you (says 
Christ), you follow me; me, me, follow me, not your 
questions or thoughts. 

About the Jews, that | should remember them in 
another book, | will see when | have time; now | have 
other things to do. Farewell and pray to the Lord for me.

traveling to Lochau to marry Michael Stiefel to the widow 
of the bishop of Lochau, M. Franz, whom you may have 
known, and at the same time to hand over the parish to 
him. It is to be wondered how one thing pushes the other.

unwillingly. He also sends letters here, which were 
delivered to me, by which he invites some of you to the

Grace and peace in Christ! That your marriage is 
notorious as fornication,” my dear Spalatin, you must not 
only not grieve over it, but rather rejoice, since you know 
for certain that this state is approved by God, praised by 
the angels, honored by all the saints, and then this seal 
is added to it, that it is distinguished by the cross, namely 
that it is blasohemed by the devils and godless people, 
also by false brothers, as it happens to every work and 
word of God. Therefore, see to it that you do not regard 
these blasphemous words of ungodly people, who are 
outcast against you, any differently than precious gems, 
by which you are indeed stained before the world, but 
glorified before God, considering that the world is not 
worthy to see the glory and honor of this work of God,

His father and master, Doctor Martin Luther. 

May the Lord be with you forever and ever, dearest 
Father, who begat me for Christ through the gospel. | 
am now producing the fruit that God intended. But 
because | fear that the former messengers may have 
deceived me, for it did not appear from your letter, 
which | received through Matthew 1), that my two 
letters from Hamburg were handed over to you, - now 
receive the history and account of my preaching 
ministry here, which | have written quite carefully, 
namely as follows: After | had come here through the 
help of the most illustrious Prince of Lineburg 2),° | 
wrote to you the next day, namely Dionysii [Oct. 9]. | 
first began to doubt for several days what kind of fruit 
| would produce in this place; | had reasons to doubt 
and was even challenged, although | was brilliantly 
received in all respects by this city. *) Now, at last, 
God has begun to show me that my work will not be 
without fruit, since not a few are beginning to love the 
Gospel and to attend the sermons even on 
weekdays, and nowhere have | seen among 
religious, both monks and nuns, a favor that seemed 
to fall more to me than here. For the whole Franciscan 
convent accepts the Gospel, and the convent of the 
preachers does not seem to resist; the third convent 
is that of the virgins, who are called "the blue sisters" 
5). In this convent, all the virgins, both the older and 
the younger ones, have changed the upper garment 
and the veil 6) by which they were at least 
unattractive, and they walk like bourgeois women. 
The other garments underneath they have as before, 
for they are respectable garments and a skirt almost 
like yours in the Augustinian order, so that they can 
go out to the sermons, and so are safe.

from the mockery of the children. All of them seem to 
be favorable to the Gospel, and they have not 
reserved any superstitions from their order, or rather 
from their disorder. All these monastic clergy, both 
women and men, are free to leave their religious habit 
and become married, which some have already done 
and live quite respectably. | now urge this against all, 
that those should not be without laws who demand an 
honorable life, who wish to remain in the monastery 
either for a time or forever, so that Satan does not one 
day cause trouble for the Gospel through idle people. 
And it is precisely this that those who preside over the 
monasteries, the Garri Anus, Pejor and Maystro, 7) 
that is the Master, demand and want the most, people 
who are certainly much too good to deserve these 
names. Moreover, there is a virgin convent of 
Benedictine order, two miles from here, in the Duchy 
of Holstein, 8) in which the virgins, except for the 
outward appearance of dress and the chanting of 
psalms, yet not out of the order of the prescribed 
ones, have left nothing of nunhood with them, even 
against the will of the provost. The superior (Domina) 
and two virgins have listened to my sermons here for 
several weeks, twice conversed with me and once 
dined with me. She is there a learned instructor 
(magistra) of all in the Gospel, and has already sent 
out six into matrimony, one of whom is the wife of the 
burgher who is here appointed administrator of my 
house 9), a very beautiful and sedate woman who 
already bears the fruit of marriage with her. That 
matron has only asked whether she may remain in 
this ungodly larva until she has advised all of hers; for 
she fears that through this appearance she would 
give an example to others who are still willing to push 
their noble virgins into such Vulcan caves. | advised 
her to stay. She is anxious to consult as soon as 
possible the two friends whom she had taken to me, 
until, after all or many had been taken out, she could 
follow herself. She fears nothing more than that the 
convent will remain a convent. But of this only so 
much. We have already begun to talk about the 
schools, and about the care of the pre-

and the care of the poor. Those who were sent to me 
last Sunday [Oct. 25] in the name of the council and 
the entire citizenry asked me to preach about the 
schools in the evening. This | did, of course, since | 
would otherwise do it at another time of my own free 
will. In the following week, God willing, we will get 
closer to the matter. But since | fear, my dear father, 
that | will have more trouble here between the council

though it was more than enough there as well, why

most noble prince, the Elector, to return immediately 
to an unjustified matter? It would have been better that 
| had not come here through so many dangers on the 
journey, in order rather to put everything into turmoil 
than to establish peace. You did not obtain a respite 
from the prince through your letters. For so his Serene 
Highness wrote to me in Brunswick, which | read on 
the day before Michaelmas [Sept. 28]: We want you 
to leave there as soon as possible for Hamburg, and 
you will have to finish the matter before Martinmas or 
at the latest two weeks thereafter. | rather believe that 
through your letter you have given the Prince the 
reason for this, so that | would be forced to return 
sooner. If | were free to return immediately, | would not 
need an admonisher. If | were to stay here the whole 
winter, | do not believe that | would accomplish 
enough. Therefore, | ask you, in accordance with the 
letter of this senate, 1) to write to the most noble 
prince, and even, what he likes to suffer, to prescribe 
a time by which you will not give advice for my hasty 
return, but advise this cause of the holy gospel of 
Christ, so that the prince may rejoice, so that you and 
the brothers may rejoice, so that Pomeranus ma

Worthy, highly learned and respectable gentleman, 
especially favorable, good friend! We thank E.") A. W. 
for the faithful diligence, so E. A. W. on our and ours 
written and verbal request to the most noble, highborn 
prince and lord, Mr. Johann, Duke of Saxony 2c. 2c. 
and the common university, as well as the mayors, 
council and community of the city of Wittenberg, to 
bestow the highly learned Mr. Johann Bugenhagen 
here. So, thanks be to God, his A. W. has come here 
fresh and healthy, even without any driving, with his 
A. W. servants, [has] started the right evangelica 
preaching ministry and reformation of the abuses, 
therefore his A. W. mainly (principalich) demanded 
here. In this business, however, everyone is still so 
unskilled that his ministry among the diverse people 
(that God wants to be remembered) that is present 
with us, in such a short time, as his ministry by the 
high-minded Elector, with the date set for his 
ministry's departure from here. Without further 
instruction from God's Word, the presentation of the 
right truth and the removal of errors, and what the 
necessity of the two and other articles would demand, 
may accomplish so little that it would be and become 
much more deplorable to cut off things so noticeably 
begun for the sake of brevity of time with uncreated 
finality, and thus to cause more confusion than 
harmony in this good city, than if his A. W. had never 
come to this place. Since, to God's honor, all of his 
lordship's lands and cities, and especially his 


diligence once again, so that their churf, Dignity and Honor 
do not want to demand the Reverend Doctorem 
Pomeranum from here in such a hurried, unjustified 
matter, but 3) may yield to his A. W. the time in grace, 
under which his A. W. may not only write or order a 
constant order of Christian activity in these places, but 4) 
may thus constantly arrange with all necessity, that first 
and last God's honor, his Reverend Doctorem 
Pomeranum's praise and honor, and all people's honor, 
may be guaranteed. Praise and Glory, and all people's 


’/blessedness may be increased from it, and the kingdoms, 


principalities, lands and cities, together with their 
inhabitants, may be peacefully governed and used, that 
we, in E. A. W., by special grace, bestowed by God from 
Heaven for the furtherance of divine work, are 


undoubtedly provided for, and will always owe it with all 


gratitude for E. A. W. (which we blessedly command to 
God [the] Almighty). Written under our signet on the day

To the Elector John of Saxony. 


Duke Georg sent Luther's answer (No. 1323) together with a 
copy of Luther's letter to Link to the Elector and demanded his 
intervention against Luther. The Elector sent the letters to Luther 
through Brick, who was traveling to Wittenberg at the time, and 
asked him to send him an answer that he could deliver to the 
Duke. Luther gave this answer by the present letter, which, 
however, he somewhat expanded and softened at the request of 
the Elector. The thus modified letter was sent to Duke George. 
Therefore, there are two originals of this letter, one in the archives 
at Weimar, the other in the archives at Dresden.

To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, 
Lord Johans, Duke of Saxony and Elector 2c., 
Landgrave in Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, 

my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | have received E. C. F. G.'s 
letter together with the complaint of Duke Georgen of 
Saxony, a copy of which is my letter to D. Wenceslaum 
Linken, as if | had let it be known that | considered him 1) 
too low, that he should ask me for an answer. herewith 
the copy of the answer | gave to Duke Georgen, which | 
will leave at this time as well, and it was also quite proper 
for me to give such an answer to S. F. G.'s writing, as | 
do not know any other way; but that | should consider him 
too low to ask me, will not, whether God wills it, be found 
in my answer. 2) Methinks he has thought himself too 
great and has not written to me as Duke George. 
However, it is necessary, | can still answer more to S. F. 
G.'s writings, but | do not know how to do it, as the matter 
stands. | am willing and obliged to serve E. C. F. G.. God 
keep E. C. F. G. mercifully, amen. On the day of

1244 Letters, from the year 
To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. 
Nicolaus Hausmann, bishop of the church in 
Zwickau, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | wonder what it is that 
you seem to know nothing at all about the visitation of 
the churches, my dear houseman, since | know nothing 
else than that you yourself are a comrade and one of the 
visitators of this region 1) with Spalatin, Dolzig and 
Planitz, and | had hoped that you would have begun the 
visitation long ago. We at least have already spent 
almost a month with visitations in our part. Also, your 
region is not indicated by the prince as being in our 
district. Everywhere Satan is Satan, but we hope for 
good, although the contempt of the word is great. 2) 

The marriage case with the virgin, who got engaged 
behind the knowledge and will of her step- and right 
parents 2c., | see in such a way that the journeyman or 
beadle sought money, and thus wanted to steal the child 
from the parents secretly, which example is no good at 
all. Therefore | would do according to the word of God in 
this matter, and let the parents keep their right here, and 
such a thief of the journeyman should be punished as an 
example to the others, and the maid should also have a 
distemper; because where this would break down (as 
before), [no] 3) alum would keep his child. 

| give the blind man and the blind woman together in 
God's name, considering the journey of dumb sins and 
other mischief. Whether children were born of it, or it 
would be difficult to feed them, one must accept it as an 
accident, to praise and honor God. Such a case rarely 
happens, like another accidental evil. Perhaps God is 
trying our faith in this way, eight also, so that we can find 
a job, so that such blind persons can be trained. Hiemit 
GOtt befohlen, Amen. Thursday after Elizabeth [Nov. 26] 
MDXXVII. 

From the heart, your Martin Luther. 


1) However, Hausmann (No. 1276) was initially 
taken into consideration as a visitator, but later he 
was dispensed with; Joh. von Dolzig was also not a 
visitator of this district; Christopn von Planitz,

istrict.

Most Serene, Highborn Prince! Ew. churf. G. is ready 


with all will beforehand to render our owed, subservient 
services. Most gracious Lord! The honorable House of 
TTaubenheim 4) has indicated to us from a letter Johann 
Riedtesel sent to him, as if your lordship had been informed 
that we would be finished with the visitation of the districts, 
which we were ordered to do, on Elisabeth [November 19], 
therefore your lordship would demand and humble him to 
the land accounts. Thereupon we ask your Lordship to know 
that only up to now the district of Wittenberg has not yet 
been completely settled due to many inaccuracies, and find 
that good caution and diligence must be used in all places. 
‘Thus, the church accounts are presented to us very darkly 
and erroneously, and there is no one among us who 
understands them according to necessity. Should we not 
have our friend from Taubenheim with us, we would be 
spoiled and would have to deal with the matters for a longer 
time. Therefore, our submissive request to the Lord Mayor, 
where it may be with honor and without special 
disadvantage to the Lord Mayor, is that the Lord Mayor 
allow von Taubenheim to remain with us until the end of our 
visitation. We are quite willing to do this for the sake of E. 
churf. G. in all submissiveness about the duty to deserve.

things; if he should find in his letters to whom they should 
be given, let him write it. For we have received what is

day, no hour free. | had hoped that we would be in the 
neighboring Schweinitz at that time and thus could steal 
half a day for his honor, but the business of the visitation 
has grown in such a way that the whole way we had

Grace and peace in Christ! | beg you, my dear 
householder, to suffer this act of your council until the 
prince has decreed otherwise; but you may privately and 
publicly ask that they henceforth do nothing of the kind, 
because the prince refers all difficult marriage questions 
to his office until a certain form is established, as the 
instruction given to the visitators expressly contains, as 
you will see; therefore you will admonish them that they, 
for fear of your prince, henceforth avoid such examples. 
You will have given them credit for it once, but they do 
not want to give cause to accuse you again. | am glad 
that you have been relieved of the office of a visitator for 
the sake of your Zwickauers. There is nothing new with 
us. Only pray for me; call upon Christ with petitions and 
in Him be at ease. December 2, 1528.

to make your answer to it and to send it to us, as he 
brought us your answer and read it out. Since he then 
reported to us that you had submitted the same 
answer for alteration, we have made a small change 
in it, but to the extent that it is not contrary to your 
writing and opinion, but that it also contains and 
maintains the same, only that it is described with a 
few other words, so that our cousin may not easily be 
induced to write and dispute further. And so that such 
an answer is your handwriting, it is our gracious 
request that you rewrite it in your own hand according 
to the copy enclosed, seal it with your seal 1) and 
send it to us by this messenger, and we will then have 
it immediately made out to our cousin and written next 
to it. In your gracious opinion, we do not want you to

Chancellor Brick to Luther. 


Brick reports that in the meantime a letter of Link to the 
younger prince has been received, for the sake of the letter 
matter, and asks whether under these circumstances the answer 
given to the Elector (and thus to Duke Georg) should remain.

My kind, quite willing service before. Venerable and

Godfather! My most gracious lord writes to you 3) for 
the sake of the answer, concerning Duke Jérgen, as 
you will hear from S. F. G.'s letter and will know how

2) According to Burkhardt, this time determination is in tergo. 

3) According to this, it seems as if the previous letter of the 
Elector was sent to Luther only two days later than his date laMet, 
namely at the same time with this letter. Luther's answer for Duke 
George (No. 1332) was sent to him only on December Il.

Joseph Levin Metzsch to Luther 
(Regest.) 

Metzsch wanted to marry a relative, Catharina, the daughter of| 
Gunther von Binau zu Elsterberg, which was also permitted by 
the Elector Johann. About this marriage, Metzsch had sought 
advice from Luther, who had instructed him (in No. 1226) not to 
seek permission or dispensation from the bishop in his case. Now 
new difficulties had arisen, in that the jurists declared that children 
produced in a marriage that was contracted in forbidden degrees 
without the permission of the pope or his clergy were to be 
considered illegitimate according to the law. Now he asks Luther 
to send out a short teaching on this matter in print. - This, however, 
Luther had already done in 1522 with the "Sermon on Marital Life", 
St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, 598. 


Printed in Weller, Altes und Neues, Vol. |, p. 119 and in Erl. 
Briefw., vol. VII, p. 33. 


1) Supplemented by us. Burkhardt remarks: "Completely 
illegible word in your already difficult concept of D.Brtick."

1512. 

3) "Drava" == threat. 


according to the Mosaic law it is determined that a leper 
is civilly dead and should be separated from the 
household. But if we now want to judge the same, who 
will carry it out? who will keep it? since our secular 
regime sets the opposite. If he therefore wants to marry 
at his peril, he may marry (that is my opinion) with a clear 
conscience, if everything else is right. But we do not 
promise him protection and defense. We concede the 
hidden right; from where he obtains the public right, he 
may see for himself, since it is not in our power. That is 
my judgment. There is no news. | am busy with the 
visitation. Duke George has written against me; you will 
see the news at mass. *) The same duke has separated 
himself from our duke in the joint minting of the coin;

which we could have given both orders at the same time. 
And yet the utmost necessity of the order of the church 
service and the pastoral care of the poor admonishes us, 
to the point of pitiful pity from the discovery of dangerous 
inaccuracy, to persevere most diligently with the 
promotion of the work. And may Your Lordship's humble 
opinion indicate that we hold, believe and know that Your 
Lordship could not have ordered a better work than the 
visitation, so there is also nothing that can weigh us down 
about such work. And after we see that it is to be 
prevented by all the lists of the enemy, so it is to Your 
Lordship our most humble and diligent request and 
request that Your Lordship let us, where we are noted in 
the work, and by some way others know how to order 
their business through other persons, to remain 
unchallenged with each other. For where one way allows 
us to be separated, we worry about one cause over the 
other and so much that we would not want to come to it 
again in a long time. Thus many souls would be missed, 
whom we hope to counsel by means of divine grace. 
Your Lordship will graciously note our letter for the best. 
We are indebted to Your Lordship for this in all loyalty.

To the highly venerable brother, Mr. Martin Gorlitz, 
the faithful and wise overseer of the church at 
Brunswick. 

| was happy and grateful to receive your very pleasant 

and agreeable letter, my dear Martin, not only because 
of the kindness it showed me, but much more because 
of the news that it indicates that your church, the work of 
our Pomeranus, is doing well. May Christ strengthen 
what he has worked in all of us, amen. 

| have written to Doctor Levin von Emden 1) and may 

you also thank him for me many times over. Your Torgau 
beer has been well used and drunk with such praise 2) 
as never before with me. For it has been reserved and 
served only for me and the visitators, who could not 
praise it enough above any they had ever tasted. But |, 
as a very fine farmer, have never thanked you and your 
Emilie, indeed, as | am a householder who does not care 
about things, | have forgotten and no longer knew that it 
was in my cellar until my servant drew attention to it 
anew. Therefore, even now | say great thanks for this 
certainly useful and pleasant gift, and that for your 
fortune is very large and. too much. Greet all your 
brothers, especially your Emilie and your son, namely the 
exceedingly lovely Hind and her beloved Deer. May the 
Lord bless you and make you grow into many thousands, 
both according to the seed of the spirit and of the flesh. 

| bravely answered Duke George, which | believe you 

have already seen, so that his flatterers and worshippers 
would not become too confident, hopeful and boastful. 
Now | am busy making the catechism 3) for the unlearned 
peasants. You and yours pray diligently for me, and be 
well in Christ. Given on January 15, 1529.

To his extremely dear brother, Magister Georg 
Spalatin, the faithful and completely sincere 
servant of God in the Gospel. 

Grace and peace! We also wish to know what you are 
doing at the visitation and what progress the matter has, 
my dear Spalatin, and it is to be wondered why you are 
silent about it when you write. We command, where it is 
necessary, a contribution; although it is only small, it 
helps somewhat the poor priests who have two yokes 
(oxen) and arable land; moreover, we strictly demand 
offering money (offertorium) from each _ one. 
Incidentally, the appearance of the church is very 
miserable everywhere, since the peasants learn nothing, 
know nothing, pray nothing, do nothing but abuse 
freedom, neither confess nor communicate, as if they 
had become completely free from religion. For thus they 
have neglected their papist things, they despise ours, so 
that it is frightening to contemplate the administration of 
the papal bishops. The rest Bruno will tell you. Greet 
Eberhard and all the brothers, and pray for me wretched 
man and sinner. Christ be with you.

Reformation History of the City of Memmingen, p. 139; from it in

collection (formerly in the possession of a Patrician family from 
Nuremberg) reported in the Deutsches Museum, vol. |, Jena

was written to the council of Nuremberg; then in the Erlangen 
edition, vol. 56, p. XIX (as to the council of Nuremberg) and by 
De WetteSeidemann, vol. VI, p. 99. - Since we consider the 
original at Memmingen to be the real one, and since we find the 
readings of the other original worse, we give the text according to 
the former. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, prudent, dear 
gentlemen! Johannes Schmelz,*) your relative, who is 
held here in the studio by E. E., has asked me for this 
writing to E. E., after God has graciously counseled your 
praiseworthy city with His holy Gospel, to admonish E. E. 
to keep faithfully to it, and to diligently guard themselves 
from the erroneous spirits. Although | am now well 
assured that God, who has begun such a work with you, 
will also keep and preserve E. E. without me and without 
my admonition, | have not despised Johann's request, 
nor have | refrained from showing my will and service to 
E. E.; for it is truly, as it now stands in the world, my 
greatest joy to hear where a city has the divine word pure 
and diligently with it. Therefore my heartfelt prayer is in 
God, the Father of all miserable people, that he may 
strengthen and preserve you and all who have his dear 
word by his Spirit against all the evil spirits and, as they 
are called, mad saints, whom the devil now sends out 
everywhere, so that E.E. and your subjects may be found 
pure, active, fruitful and blameless in his word, in his day 
and in the future, amen.

beginning of 1539 as schoolmaster at Grimma.

Palatine for an advance of four florins in order to be able to stay

To the most esteemed brother in Christ, Mr. 
Wenceslaus Link, the faithful servant of the Lord in 
Nuremberg. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have received two letters, 
my dear Wenceslaus, which are full of news. But | have 
begun to despise my Moab 3) and will no longer answer 
his invectives. Erasmus does what is worthy of him, that 
he uses the Lutheran name. Erasmus is doing what is 
worthy of him, that he so persecutes the Lutheran name, 
under which alone he now lives safely. “ 


2) Soon after the visitation, Lindenau's dispute with a party of 
the council, headed by Muhlpfort and Roth, broke out again, this 
time over the reintroduction of the apostles' days and the ringing 
of the church bells, which Lindenau opposed. Although there were 
quite a few pending against him, he nevertheless, tired of the 
dispute, asked for his resignation, which was granted on February 
27.

4) Perhaps Luther is aiming at Erasmus’ writing: Contra 
quosdam, qui se falso jactant Evangelicos, epistola Des. Erasmi 
Rot. jam recens edita et scholiis illustrata. Ad Vulturium 
Neocomum dat. Frib. 1529, 8. See Herm. v. d. Hardt, Ill, 184 (De

Why doesn't he go to his Dutch, French, Italian and 
English? "He rakes mice." He tries to prepare a place for 
himself by these flatteries, but he will not find it; he will sit 
down between two chairs. If the Lutherans hated him as 
much as they hated his own, then he would indeed 
endure Basel with danger to his life. But may Christ judge 
this atheist and epicurer Lucian. 

With us there is nothing new. Of the apparitions 
(visionibus) praised in Bohemia there is nothing certain, 
many deny it. But of the northern lights that were here, 
which | also saw on the Saturday after Epiphany at eight 
o'clock in the evening, it is certain that they were seen in 
many places as far as the ocean. Moreover, that in 
December at night over the main church in Breslau the 
sky was fiery, writes Hess, and in your other place two 
fiery floors (contignationes) were seen and in their 
center a fiery broom. | think that by these fire signs it is 
indicated that the last day is before the door. The empire 
will fall, the kings will fall, the popes will fall, and clearly 
the whole world will collapse, as a great house that is 
about to collapse is wont to begin its fall with small cracks; 
only that first the Turk, as Ezekiel [Cap. 38] prophesies of 
Gog and Magog, must be found to boast of his 
exceedingly great victory, and be corrupted with his 
comrade, the pope. Pray for me a sinner, and greet the 
Lord Abbot, 1) and command me to his prayers. Christ 
give a happy outcome to the birth of your wife. May grace

reason he asked us to give him a favorable leave,

My order, which was previously handed over to the 
Council, will be presented to the people today, so that 
they can see whether they think there is anything in it 
that would be unsuitable here; then it will be issued. "

and publicly for you and for the peace of Germany.

Friesland; it does not seem advisable to some that |

by letters and sent treatises, and if the Count should 
urge, | will see to it that, if it is possible, this pernicious

of the Gospel still keeps me here; it has cost many

will lead his work out of here soonest. My wife is

out happily. Greet my Lord Captain, the Mayor

1) The church order for Hamburg, which was modeled after 
the Brunswick church order, was adopted by the council and the 
citizens on the Saturday before Pentecost, May 15; however, it 
was not printed in Bugenhagen's time. 

2) Count Enno Il of Friesland had sent an embassy to 
Bugenhagen in Hamburg and asked him to come to Friesland for 
a short time, to preach there and to confront the heretics and 
rebaptizers who were there in large numbers. Bugenhagen did 
not go, but sent Johann Pelt and Johann Timann from Bremen.

Weimar. March 12, 1529. 


Duke Johann Friedrich zu Sachsen to Luther, 


Jonas, Hans Metsch and Hans von Taubenheim. 
(Regest.) 

Luther and Hans Metsch, because they cannot get away from 
other business, are relieved of the office of visitators, and "in their 
place" the bailiff of Bitterfeld (Sebastian von K6tteritzsch) and the 
pastor of Colditz (Wolfgang Fues) are appointed as visitators to 
finish the visitation. - This order was issued at the request of the 
captain of Wittenberg, Hans Metsch, who had reported on 
February 8 that the visitation could not be finished yet, because 
he and Taubenheim had been prevented by the escort of 
Margrave George of Brandenburg (see No. 1347), but Luther had 
not been "vhast gesundt" for more than fourteen days. In the 
opinion of Brick, Pauli and Melanchthon, who were in Wittenberg 
at the time, it did not seem at all likely that Luther would be used 
for the visitation, since during Luther's and Melanchthon's 
absence more than 100 students had left Wittenberg. The 
presence of the captain there was necessary because of the 
construction of the fortifications. In passing, Metsch noted in his 
petition that not much more was left of the 60 florins granted for 
the visitation.

convicted, do not give way to the victorious truth;

Grace and peace! Here comes the Licentiate 
Cordatus, preacher at Zwickau, my dear Spalatin, and 
delivers this letter to you; he is a man who is worthy that 
you talk to him, not to praise other things. The 
matrimonial case sent to us will follow soon; in it we have 
given judgment for the second husband, and condemned 
the first, fugitive husband, also according to the decrees 
of the pope. For we have begun to read and examine also 
the papist laws, in which we see that not even they 
themselves look to their rights or care about them, and 
we are surprised at the first judgment that has been 
passed by ours. However, | have decided to avenge the 
ingratitude of the peasants and the mob in such a way 
that, if those who have to do with any matter are not 
godly, | will refer them entirely to the officials and let the

been a godly woman.

struggle (so that you would not bear less fruit as an idle

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, 
gracious lord! Paul Lindenauer, a preacher in Zwickau, 
has come to me to be interrogated by order of E. F. G.'s 
order to be interrogated. So | found that the greatest 
cause of his willing departure from Zwickau was that the 
discord between him and some others was growing, and 
he sought ways and means to avoid it. Thus it came 
about that after the visitators had left for 14 days (as he 
reported to me), an order was issued to re-establish the 
two things, namely the weather ringing and the 
celebration of the apostles’ days, to which, as necessary 
things, he did not want to bind his conscience, and thus 
accepted the same reason to change. And | also think 
that there are some in Zwickau who were glad of his 
request to leave, and have hurried to do so, although it is 
not bad that he is gone, if the discord could be quieted. 
Because the city gives him such good testimony, and the 
visitators have let him stay, since they were present, and 
now he himself has cleared the discord, and such two 
pieces do not have much of a chance, and have been left 
free in the book of the visitators: | consider it good that E. 
F. G. has left the same. F. G. let the same Paul zur 
Elstern thus remain, so that the evil mouths would not be 
given further room to chatter, as if one pursues the 
wretch for the sake of trivial things, his repugnants for 
strength and defiance; considered, that, where he does

for us that we have obtained this from the Lord, because 
we cannot hope for anything from the concilium, of which 
it is said. 

There is with me a man who comes from Venice, who 
assures that a son of the Doge (Ducis) of Venice is at 
the court of the Turk; so far we are fighting against the 
Turk that even the Pope, the Venetians, the Frenchman 
have become Turks publicly and impudently.

1) Lorenz Werder, an Anabaptist from Torgau, who was 
defiant against the visitators and Luther. He invoked a free 
concilium, the Emperor's decree, and filed a complaint with the 
Elector. Because he made improper speeches in beer halls, he 
was put in the Beckerthor Tower. On May 10, he was released, 
but with the condition that if he did not renounce his error, he 
would have to leave the Elector's lands within two months. - 
According to Lauterbach, Tischreden, Cap. 37, ? 101, St. Louis

he lived especially in Rome, Ferrara and Venice in contact and 
friendship with the most important men. In 1540 he was a 
professor of theology in Vienna, which he left for fear of the Turks, 
perhaps also because he was considered suspicious of 
Lutheranism. He went to the Bishop of Passau, Count Wolfgang 
of Salem, who was himself considered a secret follower of Luther, 
where he probably died.

To the City Council of Memmingen. 
In response to the rumor that Holy Communion had been 
abolished in Memmingen, Luther issued this warning letter. 


The autograph of this letter is in the Memmingen Archives, 
from which Joh. Georg Schelhorn first made it known in his 
Reformation History of the City of Memmingen, p. 137; in the 
Leipzig Supplement, p. 58, NO. 86; in Walch, vol. XXI, 277. in De 
Wette, vol. Ill, p. 453 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 54, p. 71. 

To the honorable, prudent gentlemen, mayor and 


council of Memmingen, my favorable gentlemen 
and friends. 

Grace and peace from Christ. Honorable, prudent, 
dear gentlemen! Although | am concerned that this writing 
of mine would be unnecessary, and also unfruitful, yet 
because your pious city child, M. Leo, 1) wants to go out, 
and desires such, | have not wanted, on God's good 
advice, to entrust and ask E. E., in these cruel louses and 
erroneous separations. For | have learned that with you 
the Mass or Sacrament has been completely taken away 
and laid down as an unnecessary or free ceremony, 
which | am extremely sorry to hear, and which is also 
terrible. For Christ did not command his word and pen that 
we should or should not do it. Now this sacrament is 
Christ's gift and word, as his last will and testament, as no 
one can deny: therefore E. E. has to worry about a great 
wrath against your city, that Christ's word and testament 
is considered nothing at all among you. Oh, dear sirs, 
wake up, and look on the bright side, such presumption 
will not do, and may happen that we all have to repay you, 
since God is in favor of it. | don't know what to do, so | am 
saddened by such evil cries from your nobility. May the 
Father of all mercy turn his wrath away from us and give 
us to do according to his Son's word and command. This, 
alas, is what Satan finally meant when he first attacked 
this sacrament, namely, that he wanted to abolish it 
completely and cut off Christ. O dear sirs, add to this 
before it becomes still worse. The devil, so far let in, will 
not rest until he has made it worse.

Grace and peace in Christ! Here is a Scotsman, my 
dear Wenceslaus, whom | commend to you. Exiled from 
his homeland and banished for the sake of the Word, he 
wanted to go to you and has requested this letter from me 
to you, whether he could be advised in any way. He 
seems to be of respectable origin among his own and well 
versed in scholastic theology and excels in it. If he could 
speak in our language, it would have been easy to make 
use of his work. You do now as it is proper for us to do. 
We would have kept him in our poverty, but he had causes 
that moved him to do otherwise. 

We translated the Book of Wisdom, since Philip was 
absent and | was ill, so that | would not be idle; it is already 
in print, overlooked with Philip's help. For it is to be

1305 


God has already defended us against them with good 
walls of His power. Thus, such an alliance does not 
create anything more than that the enemy is caused to 
make an alliance as well, and perhaps, as a defense 
and protection, they would like to do what they should 
leave well alone. Moreover, it is to be feared, and 


perhaps all too certain, that the landgrave, where he 
has formed such an alliance, after it is a restless young 
prince, may not keep quiet, but, as happened before 
the year, may find a reason not only to protect, but to 
attack; and it is not divine that we place ourselves in 
such a position, when no one is yet hunting or seeking

(Wittenberg.) May 25, 1529. 


To the Elector John of Saxony. 


Expert opinion on how a noble abbot who would like to leave 
the monastery should behave. 


Printed in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. 285d; in the 
Jena edition (1566), vol. IV, p. 464; in the Altenburg edition, vol. 
IV, p. 559; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXII, p. 20; in Walch, vol. 
XXI, 281; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 456 and in the Erlanger, vol. 54, 
p. 75. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The respectable, highly 
respected Doctor, Gregorius Brick, has indicated to me 
how E. C. F. G. would like me to express my concern 
about the request of the Abbot of N.,") so E. C. F. G. asks 
for advice as to how he should behave, because he, by 
order of the Holy See, is to put on the cap again for more 
than a year 2c. 

On this would be my submissive objection, as | have 
used for myself so far against all outgoing personell, that 
in E. C. F. G., there are still some people who are not 
able to advise or tell someone to leave the monastery or 
to change his religion. For since such matters concern 
God and the conscience, God's Word and the Scriptures, 
which teach us what each one should do and refrain from 
doing, are not only given by way of advice, but also by 
way of commandment. Therefore, no one may ask me 
whether he should do this or that; but let him see, 
examine his own conscience. 


1) According to the inscription in the Journal von und fir 
Deutschland, 1785, where p. 431 f. our letter is printed after a bad 
copy, the abbot of Fulda; thus John Ill. (of Henneberg) 1521- 
1541.

know what he will or may believe and do. | cannot advise 
him, nor can | tell him; for in the event that | advise him, 
or tell him, and he is uncertain of the matter, and does it 
in doubt or in a wavering conscience, then | make myself 
partially responsible, and would be entirely the cause of 
such sins against God. 

But it is not a small sin to do something out of doubt 
or unbelief (that is, against the first and other 
commandments); for God wants faith and not doubt. But 
who will assure me that he believes? Would that St. 
Philip's Apost. 8 [vv. 36-38] did not want to baptize the 
eunuch, nor did he command or advise him to do so, but 
when he himself desired and said that he believed in 
Christ, he gave him baptism on the basis of such faith. 

The abbot's situation is also different. For who knows 
whether he already believed that he was strong and firm 
enough in faith to endure future temptations? For we 
read in the Scriptures, and experience it daily in 
ourselves, what the devil and all the world does against 
the right faith, and even brings about, and there is no end 
nor measure to persecution and temptation. If the abbot 
should get an evil conscience, as happens to many, and 
should find himself guilty, or should come across misery, 
poverty, unhappiness, driving, or some other accident, 
and should not be able to suffer such things, and should 
finally think and strive back again, as now many do and 
have done, it would be much better to leave it alone now. 

Therefore, no one can advise nor be called, each one 
must be his own master, counselor and helper, according 
to the divine word, and truly belongs to a man and heart 
that may stand chivalrously. E. C. F. G. have well 
experienced what the pious princess, Duchess Ursula 
von Munsterberg, has suffered over this. For it is 
especially hard to do to high persons full of great 
dominion, and quite bad, indeed not to be advised by 
anyone. 

For even if they might bring enough good with them 
in time or find it elsewhere (which is hardly possible for 
their status), it is to be feared that they might not bear the 
disgrace, contempt, hatred and disfavor that they would 
both experience from that part and among ours. Let them 
then

Letters from the year 


And who can advise them, since they do not choose to 
do and dare what the devil and the world do and want to 
do to them? And who can advise them, if they do not 
choose to do and dare what the devil and the world do 
and want to do to them? 

But this is what | wanted to advise, because all things 
are now in the balance, and no one knows where God 
will let the all-stroke go, that the abbot also suspends his 
things; perhaps God might so direct that all, or at least 
many monasteries should be opened, and he would thus 
come out without disgrace and journey, and with a fair 
amount of provision. But if they were not opened, it would 
remain in the above-mentioned manner, that he would 
have to examine himself, and take his conscience to 
counsel, and dare on God what he wanted to do, and on 
no man's counsel. For nothing good would come of it, nor 
would it last, since he who may not venture on God and 
God's word or counsel, and yet wants to venture on 
man's counsel, is an idolatrous, unbelieving heart, which 
trusts in man rather than God, and certainly intends 
nothing good, nor will it accomplish anything good, for 
which | would certainly give no cause nor counsel to 
anyone. 

Finally, | think that because the abbot, of high rank 
and birth, can nowhere be so well provided for as in the 
monastery, he should be advised more to stay inside, 
since in the monastery he would not only be well 
provided for, and would remain in good and honor 
without disgrace, but could also create much more good 
than outside. For outside he can help no one, but mair 
must help him, and would still have to be of low standing 
and despised. But in the monastery, he would have 
everything in his hands, could help many, and in time 
weaken the monastery atrocities and let them perish, and 
thus help many consciences to truth and freedom; as the 
pious princess, the abbess at Gernrode, 1) and many 
other prelates do. 

For if he is serious about having the gospel and 
serving God, he cannot serve better than to do as now 
said, 


1) Gernrode, a women's abbey in the Anhalt region 
(Bernburg). Elisabeth von der Weida was abbess 1504-1532. 





. No. 1399. 1400. 1309 
It does him no harm to his conscience that he remains 
inside, because he remains inside to help overthrow the 
abominations and promote God's word, which he cannot 
do outside. If God wanted me to be such an abbot or prior 
over a monastery, | would advise the matter much better 
than if | were outside, and | would chase the devil away 
in his own color and with his own nature. 

But if the abbot complains that he cannot marry, | 
would rather advise him to take a secret wife, and 
nevertheless, as | said, because it is neither a disgrace 
nor acustom among the papists to have wives, until God 
the Lord sends otherwise, as he will do shortly; for the 
matter cannot stand in this way for long. Hereby the 
abbot would be safe and provided for, and should not 
complain about his friendship, since St. Paul also 
punishes those who are burdensome to others, and 
neither work nor accomplish anything for it 2c., 1 Thess. 
2 [v. 9]. 

This time | have shown this in haste, at E. C. F. G.'s 
request. Command E. C. F. G. hereby to the Father of all 
grace and mercy. Date May 25, Anno 1529.

my letter, my dear Spalatin, with a certain pastor in your 
vicinity. He has asked me to recommend him to you. 
Therefore, | ask, if you are able, that you help him in this 
matter when he asks for your help. 

Incidentally, we are indeed quite well here, as befits 
Christians. Everything that has been brought from the 
Imperial Diet, | believe, is already known to you. Philip 
greets you respectfully. He has something against the 
Sacramentarians under his hand, 1) likewise about the 
epistle to the Romans, about which he is now also 
reading. | translated the Book of Wisdom while | was idle 
because of my hoarseness; it will soon go out in a better 
form than it is in the Latin and Greek originals. Farewell 
and pray for me. May 28, 1529.

To Gerhard Wilskamp in Herford. 
Short response to a letter received along with gifts. 


First in German in Walch, Vol. XXIII, Zusatze, p. 35. Walch 
considers this letter to be originally written in German, and 
therefore wants it to be placed in Vol. XXI, 286. But it is in Latin 
in Luppe, in Seebode's Neuer krit. Biblioth. flr das Schul- und 
Unterrichtswesen. 1823, vol. |, issue 2, p. 244; in De Wette, vol. 
Ill, p. 461 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VII, p. 104. 

To the faithful servant of Christ, the Lord Gerhard, the 
lamp 2) of Xanten, my exceedingly dear [friend] in 
the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! My servant had thrown 
your letter among all kinds of papers, my dear Gerhard, 
so that when | wrote and the messenger suddenly 
wanted to leave, he could not deliver it to me again. That 
is why | do not fully understand what you had written, 
since | thought that | could see your letter again. 
Because, to put it briefly, | felt that 


1) This will probably be the writing that appeared only in 1530: 
Sententia veterum aliquot scriptorum de doona Domini (Corp. 
Ref., Vol. XXIll, 731), which he revised after the Marburg 
conversation. 

2) Cf. no. 1315. 





Your heartfelt love for me is expressed in that letter, 
which is also indicated by the gifts. By the way, to the 
sister who sent the gift, | again give this sealed book. But 
| would like to know which books you do not have that 
are printed here, | would certainly send them to you very 
gladly. You, as you do, pray for me and all my house, and 
| will do the same, for | ascribe much to your prayers. 
Fare well in Christ. May 28, 1529 Martin Luther.

To Jakob Montanus from Speier. 


Grace and peace in Christ! What you write about 
Erasmus, who foams at the mouth against me, my dear 
Jacob, | know well enough from his letters and have seen 
it in them. He does not publish a book in which he does 
not express the inability of his mind or rather the pain of 
the wound he has received. But | despise him and will not 
dignify the man with any further discussion, but if | write 
something that concerns him, | will deal with the matter 
myself. | will only think of Erasmus as if | were speaking 
of a third person, condemning his opinion rather than 
refuting it. For the man is exceedingly frivolous, who 
completely ridicules all religions, after the manner of his 
Lucian, nor does he write anything seriously, except 
when he writes revenge and harmful things. 

Here we are all well, which we attribute to your 
prayers. | thank you for the gifts which your love for us 
shows; | would again send books, as | promised before, 
if | knew which ones or which you lacked, but these, 
which have recently been published, | send. Fare well in 
Christ, and, what you do, pray for me, Wittenberg, the 
28th day of May 1529. Mart. Luther.

Grace and peace in Christ. Venerable father and man 
to be revered in the Lord! It is wonderful how | was 
moved joyfully and sweetly in the Lord by the receipt of 
your letter together with the pork ham, since | realized 
that you, who are already weakened by old age, 2) are 
taken and enlightened by the Gospel of Christ before the 
day of death. | consider this grace of God to be 
completely miraculous, since | know how the great ones 
of your class tend to resist the word of God. The Lord 
Jesus, who has begun his work in you, will also 
accomplish it. This | ask and desire, amen. 


Therefore, just as you, venerable father, desire to see 
me, it would again be a great delight to me in Christ to 
see your venerable gray hairs, who confess Christ in this 
crowd of hostile great ones, from whom they dare to 
deviate. Of course it would not be right for me, 3) nor 
would | be free to travel there. But may the Lord give it, 
who can bring us together, even if only once; he 
strengthen you according to his mercy, venerable father, 
and keep you, amen. May 28, 1529. Yours, Martin 
Luther.

Grace and peace through Christ our Savior. 
Worthy and esteemed dear Lord and Brother! After 
your Mr. Wolfgang Chalickus [Cholecker, Calixtus] 
ordered to Cronschwitz to see how it [had] a form, | 
summoned him to me, because | noted that he was 
well versed in preaching the divine word, and asked 
him to go there, because | hoped that he should 
accomplish something enough by the grace of God. 
Although he has shown me many shortcomings, | 
have done so much with him that he gave me this 
answer: you are his lord and father, whatever you do 
with him, he will do obediently. Therefore my request 
to you is very friendly: If he is in need of anything, | 
will give him advice as far as | am able, and show 
myself brotherly toward him, for | hope to God 
Almighty that he will do much good by the word. 


He also reported to me how great disorder was in 
the monastery; | advised him to report this to you 
article by article, that you had reported it to my lord 
and asked his C. F. G. that it be changed. | have 
advised him to report it to you in articles, that you 
have reported it to my lord and asked his C.F.G. that 
it be changed, and especially that the preacher be 
provided with a proper dwelling together with his 
salary, so that he may not look into the hands of the 
nuns. For those who have been there before have 
kept the nuns like dogs; if it should happen to the 
pious, well-versed man, | would be heartily sorry. If 
you would seek this from my lord, his lordship If you 
were to seek this from my lord, his C.F.G. would 
otherwise order it more recently. Please be so kind as 
to let this man come here, you shall see, God will 
grant grace that something good will be 
accomplished through him. | hereby command you, 
together with your spouse and children, to the 
Almighty, who will give us all his divine grace and 
peace, amen. My hand. On the Saturday after Trinity

and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VII, p. 108. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 
1166. 

Grace and peace in Christ! There is nothing new with 
us that you do not know. | have sent these servants of 
the word of Goslar to you, so that they may tell you the 
state of the church in Goslar; these, | pray, you will hear 
graciously and let them be commanded to you. They 
seem to me to be good and righteous, and worthy of the 
favor of godly people. But it is also yours to know such 
things and to be told of them, since you first laid the 
foundation of godliness there and did not build on it 
without happiness. Then it will encourage the godly and 
timid people when they become aware of our agreement 
and joy in this matter. At the same time, it will either 
disgrace or at least hinder Satan with his tools. 
Therefore, receive them favorably with a friendly face 
and comfort them with the mercy of Christ. For those who 
are so fearful of aversions and so anxious for harmony 
can only intend the best in Christ. Christ keep you and 
keep you well, Amen. On the last day of May, 1529.

Martin Luther memo. 


To Torgau. 
To Grimma. 

In memory of the visitators of Grimma, Magdalenen 
Staupitzen is to be given a little house of the monastery 
for the rest of her life, 1) in honor of and thanks to her 
brother D. Johann Staupitz. 

[In the monastery he is to visit Clemen, who is 
obstinate against the Gospel, and he is appointed 2) to 
deal with some secret dealings together with Magistro 
Rode, the mayor, on Duke George's part and the 
adversary. 

[At Colditz a house is to be hereditary to the priest, 
likewise to the good old man He N. Stogheim, as | 
diligently indicated to H. Doctor Jonas. 

[Here in Torgau, to talk with the common caste: 

[In order to maintain the cantor's office and the divine, 
praiseworthy art of music, it is desired to pay asmall sum 
of money from the common treasury for an organist and 
about one fl. for paper and writing, for sang books, and 
to love and support the poor chaplain, who in former 
times earned his living here in pestilence and all 
hardships, now in Hans Feil's house, also with a tax from 
the common treasury. 

Whether a village priest of ours has enough supply of 
30 or 40 fl. according to the example of Margrave 
Georgen? 


1) This gives us the approximate timing, because as we see 
from Luther's letter to Jonas of June 15, this was also already 
aligned at that time. 

2) "appointed" in the call, notorious.

omitted, while another is inserted; thus in Cod. Gothan. 185, fol.

To Justus Jonas, Inspector of the churches at 
Meissen. 

Grace and peace in Christ! With the letter to 
Reifenstein for your Laurentius 2) it happens as you 
wrote. 3) By the way, as you recently wrote and we had 
asked that Joachim 4) be sent to you for the parish near 
Colditz, we have come to a different opinion, because he, 
who speaks in Saxon dialect, seemed to us to be less 
suitable for the place, which we did not think of before, 
especially because in the meantime he has received the 
position in the castle, in which he followed Mr. Nicolaus, 
who had left for Silesia and preached in your place. Thus 
he remains here until he is called to Saxony. Now there 
is something else. This Simon, who delivers this letter, 
was deposed by the bishops of Thuringia or rather freed 
at Kreuzburg, in fact without any great fault on his part, 
but more through the hatred of this hard people, so that 
peace would exist in the place, and he was highly 
recommended to me by Frederick Mecum, although he 
was already well known to me before. For he is well 
versed in teaching, also in eloquence among the first. But 
why should | praise him who is perhaps well known to 
you? | now ask that you praise this one at the 


1) De Wette and the Erlanger Briefw. lack this evidence. 

2) Probably Laurentius Nieder, cf. no. 1297. 

3) Here, the following is missing in Buddeus and Walch up to 
the middle of the last paragraph, instead of which the section from 
No. 1393 is inserted: "The well-known Jakob Ziegler" 2c. - "Other 
at another time." 

4) Joachim Hund. Cf. no. 1393. 





The provost of Kemberg says that he has a parish in the 
vicinity of Torgau, which has been taken care of by the 
better ones, especially since he also has a wife, a very 
good woman, and two children to take care of; you can 
certainly use him in any place. 

Your wall stands as a wooden one, built by ribs and 
beams; now it also begins to become a flesh one, through 
the bricks. 5) We hope that Pommer is on his way and 
will return to us. © Yesterday | took in three nuns who 
miraculously escaped from Freiberg in Meissen with the 
help of their parents. One is a noblewoman of

6) Bugenhagen did not start the journey until June 9. 

7) Duke George. 

8) In the editions, this letter has the date: "May 6, 1529", the 
invalidity of which is already doubted by the Erl. Briefw. doubts. It 
seems that Benedict Pauli took the letter with him, the ecce 
suggests his personal presence. It is inconceivable that Luther 
wrote on May 6: "Behold, Benedict Pauli is coming," and only on 
June 15: "I hope that Benedict Pauli has come to you," and: "You 
will learn everything from Benedict Pauli." Furthermore (this has 
been claimed by De Wette for a later dating), the matter of Lorenz 
Werder, of which the first report will have reached Luther shortly 
before May 6 (cf. No. 1393), also requires the course of a longer 
time, since Luther has learned in the meantime, as our letter 
shows, that Werder has sued him and the visitators before the 
Elector, and the latter instructs the Chancellor Brick to inquire 
from Luther about the whole deal. The letter will, as we think, have 
been written shortly before June 15.

since | have sent the more detailed story back to you for 
your information. Therefore, it behooves you to keep the 
story and his words safe, so that if Satan wanted to do 
anything, you would be ready to shut him up. He would 
like to present himself as blameless and undefiled, but we 
would like to present ourselves as defiled and impure. 


1) Carlstadt has settled in Friesland happily and 
triumphantly [for a long time]. In [two] 2) boastful and 
congratulatory letters, he has called his wife to him; of 
course, Satan will bring us new monstrosities there. Let 
Christ be our strength, who strengthens us who are weary 
and tired. For in truth we are forced to be people like 
Hercules and Atlas, so much so that the whole world lies 
on our shoulders. No bishop, no prince administers the 
office, so that the former only takes care of one church, 
yes, one soul, the latter only one city, yes, only one 
house. All of them are angry to destroy the will of God.

because nothing has come of the captain's bricks, for 
what reason you will hear orally. To M. Milich we have 
engaged Susanna Muschwitz, the sister of Doctor 
Augustin's wife. Pommer writes that he will come shortly; 
when he is here, | will be able to act and work more easily 
with you in the visitation, if it is otherwise necessary.

To the highly learned, our dear special one, Martino 
Luthern, Doctorn 2c. 

By the Grace of God George, Margrave of 
Brandenburg 2c. Our favorable greeting before. 
Highly learned, dear special one! Since, by the grace 
of God, the Gospel is preached everywhere in our 
principalities and lands, and outside of them in 
several monasteries, which our parents have been 
given the protection and protection of by former 
Roman emperors, and since many abuses have been 
stopped in the parish churches and, on the other 
hand, a proper divine or church service has been 
established, but, in addition, in several monasteries, 
all kinds of pontifical abuses are still being 
perpetrated by the monks. This is the cause of all 
kinds of annoyance and opposition among other of 
our Christian subjects, which we, as a prince who 
likes to be a Christian and do right, want to stop and 
prevent, and have therefore asked the worthy, highly 
learned Mr. Johann Brenzen  (Prentzen), 
ecclesiastical priest of Swabian Hall, for advice, and 
have also asked the priest for advice.

We have received from him a short advice 3) in 
writings, as you can hear from 4) the enclosed 
copies. And because our mind is set on acting with 
brave Christian counsel in such matters, we herewith 
request you, quite amicably, to communicate to us 
your faithful Christian counsel in such matters in the 
most conducive manner, and also to give us different 
order and measure, or to indicate how we are to 
conduct ourselves in these matters, so that the 
annoying un-Christian abuses may be put an end to 
everywhere in our authority as soon as possible, and 
correct true worship may be established. For we 
testify with God that we seek nothing but God's 
honor, the salvation of our subjects and common 
Christian peace, and we do not intend to improve the 
monastery and monastic estates at all, and even if we 
find it in our council to let the useless persons die and

Grace and peace in the Lord! | understand from your 
letter, my dear Jacob, that you are heartily tired and weary 
of bearing the ungodly nature that you still see growing 
and rising from day to day, so that you are thinking of 
changing or leaving your place. Beware of doing that. For 
if you want to carry only the good, what special thing are 
you doing? Do not the tax collectors and sinners do the 
same? [Be of good courage, and undaunted, and wait for 
the Lord" [Ps. 27:14]. Remember the holy man Lot, and 
remember that the apostle Peter foretold and pictured that 
all Christians in the last days would be like Lot [2 Pet. 2, 
7]. Therefore, let us not go out of Sodom nor leave it until 
an angel comes from heaven and takes us away [Gen. 
19:15, f]. 

The world is a Sodom. In Sodom we have to live and 


i}see all the evil that plagues the righteous souls. But so 
G their end draws near, so the iniquities of the Amorites 


become full [Gen. 15, 16.], so they bring upon themselves 
a swift condemnation [2 Petr. 2, 1]. Fare well and pray for

Nicaea has decided godly and with good consideration 
that churches should seek ordination from neighboring 
churches. But ordination is not to be sought by those who 
persecute the gospel of Christ; they are to be avoided as 
accursed people, as Paul says [Gal. 1:8]: "If anyone 
teaches another gospel, let him be accursed." Therefore, 
it is certain that our ordination is valid by divine authority 
and according to the testimony of the Synod of Nicaea. 
Therefore we commend this Wenceslaus to godly 
churches, and pray that the Holy Spirit may govern his

among the enemies of God some, however few they may 
be, are found to be friends of God. The world loves its

his own hand. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, careful, dear 
Lord and friend! Herewith | am sending you a letter from 
Magister Bernhard Ziegler; and because | notice that the 
wood has already been put to the fire that he should 
teach Ebrdaisch with you, | want to help with this and ask 
you to let him be commanded to do so. But | will not leave

he is the most learned, most diligent, most pious, most

Georgen, | will gladly grant it to H. F. G. as well. Hiemit

lipps Melanchthon for the best in this matter. 

First of all, we consider it good to let the monasteries 
and convents remain until they die out; for since the old 
ones still live in them, there is not much hope that it would 
go peacefully where they would be forced to promote or 
tolerate such innovations; also, in the end, such lections 
and ordinances, which are reestablished from the 
previous old examples, would in time again become a 
barren entity, as has happened so far. But what one 
would want to reestablish of such old good order of 
church services, that 2) one would do it in the common 
children's schools and parish churches, where the 
common man would also come to and be stimulated, as 
we do here in Wittenberg and other cities. 

For another, it would be fine for the F. F. G. to 
establish a place (or two) in the principality for a high 
school, where not only the Holy Scriptures, but also law 
and all kinds of arts would be taught, from which schools 
learned people could be taken as preachers, pastors, 
scribes, councilors 2c. for the whole principality. And for 
this purpose, the monasteries and convents should be 
ordered to pay an inheritance, so that they may receive 
good scholars with honest salaries: 2 theologians, 2 
jurists, 1 medicum, 1 mathematicum, and four or five 
persons per grammar, dialectica, rhetorica, etc.. For 
where there is to be a good study, there must not be 
empty cloisters or empty monasteries and "Stiftkirche", 
but a city in which many come together and practice and 
stimulate and do among themselves. Solitary studies do 
not do it, common ones do it, since many give cause and 
example to the other 2c. 

Thirdly, that in all towns and villages good children's 
schools be prepared, from which one can "take and 
choose" those who are capable of high school, from 
which one can draw men for country and people. And 
where the towns or citizens were not able to do so, that 
one should donate scholarships from the "finished 
monasteries and convents to obtain some skilful 
assistants", so that each town would have one or two 
students. 

In time, when the common man see

If their sons are able to become pastors, preachers and 
other offices, they will probably keep the same ones in 
school again who now think that no scholar can be fed. 

Whether some scholars, educated in such schools, 
might come to serve and hold office in other principalities, 
and want to be pretended that other masters’ people 
would be attracted to them: 1) it is to be considered that 
one has no harm to them; for they would undoubtedly 
promote such schools and foundations with other princes 
and people and make favor 2c. Such | wanted to indicate 
to E. F. G. according to my little understanding. May God 
give His Holy Spirit to E. F. G. to improve all this and to 
accomplish His good pleasure in all things, Amen. July 18,

him. So he is also a child of the country 2c.

To the man highly revered in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, the faithful and diligent bishop of 
Zwickau. 

Grace and peace in Christ! This Wolfgang Rappolt is 
leaving us to go to his Nuremberg, after he has been 
released by us upon his request. It is certain, however, 
that he will address you, but we have not let him go empty- 
handed, given our poverty, and would like to see him 
healthy.

support.

vol. XXI, 1175. 

Grace and peace in Christ! This Wolfgang Rappolt, 
who came to us before (if | am not mistaken), 
recommended by you, | again recommend to you, my 
dear Wenceslaus, that he returns to you. For although we 
wanted to keep him back, so that we did not burden 
others 2) as we otherwise supported him from the 
ecclesiastical collections: yet he stubbornly set his mind 
on changing the air and the place in order to restore his 
health. Therefore we let him go, gave him ten florins for 
carriage and traveling money, and paid his debts, that we 
might not leave him empty as he came. For he says he 
has relatives at Nuremberg whom he confidently hopes 
will support him. Therefore, if your help should be 
necessary for him to be taken in either in a hospital or 
with his relatives, you will be doing a work of mercy, for 
we too have kept him in our poverty long enough so that 
he did not want to be a burden or a complaint to us, even 
though we were willing to continue to feed him out of 
forbearing love. If it should be necessary, make use of 
Osiander's service and help. Pray for me, a poor sinner.

| would have no excuse if | did not write to you. First of 
all, | thank the Lord for calling and guiding you there; then 
| thank him for the fact that some people like you and 
others do not like you. For so it is also with us, that false 
brethren trouble us more than the adversaries, and we 
are only now compelled to learn what it is that St. Paul so 
often complains about false brethren. Since they were 
not able to do anything before us and without us, they 
now live up to the praise of their progenitor: "He that 
eateth my bread treadeth me under foot. But since even 
the Lord Christ, and before him the prophets, and after 
him the apostles, were compelled to suffer such people, 
who are we that we should refuse to be conformed in the 
same likeness to Him whom we preach, since even they, 
the people of an exceedingly tender heart, were no less 
moved by the very burdensome and ignominious 
likeness of the agonies, so that Christ clearly indicates 
this pain Matth. 18:6, where he judges the perpetrators of 
the offense with such a terrible sentence that a millstone 
is hung around their neck and they are drowned in the 
deepest part of the sea. Therefore remember the psalm 
of consolation and exhortation, which says [Ps. 27:14.] 
"Harvest thou the LORD, be of good cheer, and do not 
fear, and wait for the LORD." Dear Lohmiller will report 
everything about me and, as an eyewitness, everything 
that is going on with us. 

The Landgrave of Hesse summoned us to Marburg 
on St. Michael's Day in order to attempt a union between 
us and the Sacramentarians. After we, Philip and I, had 
refused for a long time and resisted in vain, we were 
finally forced by his impetuous urging to promise that we 
would come, but | do not yet know whether the journey 
will go ahead. We have no good hope, but stand in the 
suspicion that everything is full of pitfalls, so that they 
may carry off the honor of victory, as we see that in the 
time of Arius such meetings always did more harm than 
good, and the glorious Arians continued to spread theirs. 
Osiander of Nuremberg, Johann Brenz and others have 
also been called, but they very much refuse to come.

guilty of letting the multitude either of sects or of 
ungrateful men overcome you through weariness and 
compel you to take upon yourself another work. From

you not carry it out? Then | hear only the one party; no

To the in Christ highly venerable brother Thomas 
Léscher, pastor in Milau, the faithful and sincere 
servant of the word. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Concerning what you write 
about those blasphemers, my dear man in your Lord, this 
is my opinion: As no one must be forced to faith and 
gospel, so under the same authority they are not to be 
allowed to blaspheme, but they are to be called, heard 
and listened to, and if they cannot give an account, even 
if they do not want to believe, they are also to be forced 
to be completely silent, and a plantation of sedition is not 
to be cultivated. For whoever wants to contradict, let him 
do so publicly, and either publicly or in particular he shall 
be restrained by the authority of the authorities. This is 
what we do and advise. From this you will already see that 
those under the same authority are by no means to be 
permitted to do in the church what you write. For this is 
the hissing of the serpents that flee the light. Therefore, 
bring them to the light, so that they may either conquer or 
be defeated. By the way, since the Ten Commandments 
and the Catechism also teach things concerning worldly 
rule and stewardship, and this must be preached very 
often, they must be forced to attend the sermons from 
which they may learn worldly obedience and the duties of 
stewardship, whether they believe the Gospel or not, lest 


missing, which is already given in the Eisleb. Edition: "To the strictIthey be a source of offense to others by despising the 


and firm Joseph Levin Metzsch at Mila, my favorable master and

Grace and peace in Christ! | did not want to let this 


messenger go to you empty, without a letter from me, my 
dear Nicolaus, although | had nothing great to write. They 
say that the English plague is raging in Zerbst and with 
you. Many think that it is also with us, but | do not believe 
it. Our captain has made himself ill through his 
imagination, although no other evil has appeared than his 
thoughts. For if these were the right beginnings of this 
disease, | would have had them more often in these last 
three years and more, for | also sweated that night and 
woke up with fear, and thoughts also began to torment 
me; if | had given in to them, | would have lain down," just 
as others have already lain down and tormented 
themselves. | write this so that you may admonish the 
people with me, that they should not be so fainthearted 
and not contract the disease by their thoughts, which is 
not yet there. For we have roused many, as it were by 
force, who had already lain down to sweat, as Aurogallus, 
Bleikard, 1) D. Briick, M. Christian and others, who now 
tell us with laughter that they might still be lying down if 
they were not induced to get up. Not as if | thought that 
this disease was to be despised, but because a distinction 
must be made, since we seem to fall into it more through 
imagination and fear than in fact and through infection, 
and imagination brings about the fall, and the movements 
of the mind act on the body. By the way, pray for me, 
sinner, and if your guest is still there, greet him in my 
name. May the Lord Christ be with you, Amen. August 27,

May the grace of God be with you, my dear 
Wenceslaus! The rumor of the new plague, which is 
called the English one, compels me to write to you. But 
see to it that you do not believe easily, and do not let your 
people be frightened. In this matter, many trivial things 
are carried about, both about us and about others. The 
booklet about the remedy against this disease, which has 
been published, 2) is the cause that many, when they 
begin to sweat, immediately believe through the added 
fear that they are afflicted with it, [even those,] 3) who 
have never sweated. In Magdeburg, 800 or 1000 have 
begun to sweat in this way, but all have recovered, 
except those whom the violence of the heat, which is 
aroused by this force, has killed without illness, namely 
20 or 30. And now they see how fear has done its 
mockery with them. Thus | have delivered many with us, 
and even myself, by driving out this fear, and now there 
is the highest peace, since by the grace of God none has 
died yet. It delights Satan to frighten and make us fearful 
in this way. Therefore, advise yours not to be afraid, and 
if anyone should be troubled by this imagination, he may 
sweat if he pleases, but not more than the constitution of 
his body can bear. The situation is different if the right 
illness should occur, for, as | hear, these cannot be saved 
by any remedy at all. The others, who are afflicted by 
imagination and fear, will come back badly, unless they

Grace and peace in Christ! Your prophet Amos, 
venerable and highly famous Brenz, has been handed 
over to me, and | have read it in its entirety. Far be it from 
me to change or add anything in this work. | do not want 
to be a master of the holy scriptures; God only wanted 
me to be a student to some extent. The one to whom you 
have given it, is deliberately postponing the publication; | 
do not know what tricks of the printers he fears. But he 
will publish it, unless he despises me, who urges him to 
do so. 1) If only God would that Christ would continue in 
you and complete his work. 

By the way, what you write about the meeting in 
Hesse, to which you were called, you also judge correctly 
that nothing good tends to spring from these fraudulent 
meetings of the churches of God. Therefore, | ask you, if 
you can, do not attend, nor promise to attend if you have 
not already made a promise. 2) We have resolutely 
refused from the beginning, but since this young Hessian 
Macedonian was so troublesome to our prince, we have 
been forced to give our pledge, but in such a way that

we indicated two or three times with many words that 
there was no hope, no fruit, nothing good to be expected, 
but everything worst was to be feared. But he insisted. 
We, however, promised to appear, if he also invited

others, and | have asked him to give a testimony as to

been almost good for six years, and that we are equally

| am surprised that he could have made it this far, and if 
he had asked us for advice before, he would have 
become much narrower and weaker. Therefore, my 
friendly request is that you and the congregation put up 
with such an action and be careful that such decency is 
kept for your good, and God, who started it so well, will 
bring it to completion well, if we ask with diligence. Much 
water will pass these six years; when the day comes, so 
comes the council, and it is not easy for the bishop to do 
something, because both emperor and empire have 
enough to do. One can see what both kings of Hungern 
and Dennemarck have to do; so | have also seen how the 
said M. Johann Lohmiuller of the Duke of Prussia has 
written letters for you, ordered and delivered them well 
and finely, so that, if God wills, there shall be no need. | 
have informed E. F. of this, in order to give cause for

To the noble, well-born Lord, Lord Albrecht, Count of 
Mansfeld and Lord of Schrappel and Heldrungen, 
my gracious Lord. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Gracious Sir! In response 
to E. G.'s current letter about the booklet that Magister 
Eisleben has sent out of German proverbs, and what the 
three princes, Wirtemberg, Hesse, Brunswick, E. G. and 
brother and cousins have written about it, what my 
opinion is about such a booklet, | do not want to give E. 
G. my thoughts. | will not hide my thoughts from E. G., 
that | am immediately surprised that such three princes 
trouble E. G. with it; for if Eisleben had sinned a little in 
his booklet, he would have been amply and well paid for 
by Ludwig von Passavant's poisonous, evil, cunning 
booklet, so that such princes should have been satiated. 
| do not want to defend M. Eisleben's things now, as little 
as | want to hinder, yes, even encourage him to let more 
German proverbs go out; but | want E. G., as my dear 
born sovereign, that M. Philipsen's and my 
aforementioned Ludwig von Passavant's booklet weighs 
heavily on us, and may the hour come when | would also 
play with him the art that he plays with us inside; nor 
would we have provided that such a booklet should be 
allowed to go out in Hesse. But God preserve them, that 
they only do not let such booklets go out more. We 
understand German, too, but we will continue to watch 
what they want to do. | am probably disturbed that M. 
Eisleben has so humbly answered for himself, and yet 
should suffer such shameful little books. | humbly wish to 
report this to Your Grace at such a request, for | am 
prepared to serve Your Grace. September 9, 1529.

Luther sends with the previous letter the draft of a justification 
writing for Agricola. 


The locations are given at the previous number. 


1529. no. 1452. 1453. 1357 


Gracious Sir! | have put the sealed letter 1) in such a 
way, if it pleases Your Lordship to let it be read, or even 
to send it away, so that the three princes should notice 
my opinion, and mean that they have offended us with 
the booklet as much as Agricola 2) has offended the said 
princes, so that they get a conscience, and do not press 
so cynically on the poor man. They court with the booklet, 
God help that they spoil the dance, amen. But as Agricola 
should put the answer to E. G. | give on E. G. 
improvement this form: 


Firstly, because HM the Archduke of Austria, together 
with the Swabian Confederation, has condemned, 
punished and chased away the reigning prince not only 
in word but also in deed as an unpleasant tyrant, and still 
boasts and uses this every day, it is not my place to 
revoke my writing, since | have done nothing more than 
write in word what they have committed in deed, and 
which is still based on a right. If | should now recant, | 
would have to condemn the high king and lord, and set 
myself up as a judge between the Wurtemberg and that 
part, which neither in the conscience of God nor in the 
eyes of the world would suit me. 

As long as he does not carry out his cause, neither he 
nor anyone else has the right or power to forbid or prevent 
me from keeping up with that part; for how would he do 
so if | were turned toward that part? Then he would have 
to suffer and let me go unpunished for speaking and 
writing as my part speaks and does, just as he had to 
suffer from the part of N. 3). Therefore, (with leave) all 
three princes have offended themselves too much in this, 
that they not only condemn that part with a free judgment, 
if they are not judges of it, but also demand execution of 
such an outrageous judgment from E. G., which both of 
them have done. 


1) This is the previous letter, with respect to which Luther left it 
up to the count to let everyone read it, or to send me away to the 
complaining princes.

1358 Letters from the year 
Pieces are made insufferable, both before GOlt and the 
world. 

For where E. G. should punish me, she also reached 
too high, and presumed with the deed to be the judge of 
His Majesty and the Swabian Union, to condemn the 
latter, and to justify Duke Ulrich, which would 
undoubtedly not only bring E. G. into great suspicion of 
sedition, but also make her publicly guilty before God and 
the world with a seditious deed, since God is in favor of 
it. But because | do not invent anything new on him, nor 
do | lie (as they accuse me with knowing untruth”) ), but 
speak the same that is imposed on him by that part in 
fact, and still justify myself: then he can no more to me, 
than that he must reckon me under that part, and rightly 
or properly neither judge me nor punish me, because he 
has rightly overcome and punished that part; because he 
has such calumnies not from me, but from that part, from 
which | also have it. 

Now he cannot force me to condemn that part for his 
sake; and if | wanted to do it, | could not. But it is the 
same as in the schools, where the bacchants, 2) if they 
do not like to take revenge on the schoolmaster, then 
they call a poor boy. So the duke wants to take revenge 
on me, a poor man; because he cannot do so, he stabs, 
injures and blasphemes such a powerful king and ruler 
under my person, who are still unconvicted and he still

Therefore, once again, their intentions and requests to 
Your Grace are unreasonable and against all justice; for 
this booklet, with the most impudent, poisonous, and 
insulting lies, reproaches me and my company, who are 
nothing else, nor can they be interpreted, than D. Mart. 
and M. Philip, together with their peers; yet the 
dishonorable villain and poet of the booklet knows well 
that we are the most famous in all the world, who have 
written and acted so diligently against sedition and for 
the supremacy, and, God willing, such a shameful 
blasphemous mouth and pen of ours shall be struck 
once, and his desperate malice shall not be given to him. 

And if | should speak rightly of sedition, then these 
three highly-named princes would be right seditionists in 
this piece, that they drive E. G. and demand to practice 
seditious pieces and deeds, namely to set themselves 
up as judge over this matter with physical punishment on 
me, to condemn that part and to justify this part. That is 
to say, to seek rebellion and misfortune, so that if the liar 
and blasphemer had looked at his beam, he would have 
forgotten my splinters. 

From all this | hope E. G. sees reason enough that | 
must not nor can revoke, and E. G. must not nor can 
punish me. G. should not nor can punish me, but 
because it has turned out that way that | have become 
that part with my booklet, | must remain with the same 
part until the end of the matter. So E. G. must also let 
things go and stand like this until this part is found 
innocent by judges to whom such a finding is due, and 
not according to the finding of the three princes, who may 
be suspected here as part and parcel, and not be judges. 

In addition, if | recanted, | would first and foremost be 
the right rebel and arch-villain, as the one who thereby 
condemned Royal Majesty and the Swabian Union. Maj.

of all dishonor, which he puts D. Martinus, Philipps and 
my society as an evil-doer, and would therefore have to 
be partially responsible for all of his misdeeds and 
malice, committed in the aforementioned booklet. 
Likewise, E. Gn. would also be guilty of such everything, 
if they punished me according to their srevelu judgment. 
| hope, however, that they will leave E. G. alone with this, 
and rather punish those themselves, by whom they are 
provoked and led to inflict such evil acts and 
abominations on E. G.. Please E. G. 2c. 


What E. G. should do against Eisleben, you may well 
hear my opinion from such a form. What does Duke 
Ulrich want to do to him? It is well known that he has 
been put on his guard and expelled by the Reich's 
judgment, so Eisleben does him no wrong, indeed, he 
almost spares him. If this matter were mine, the devil 
should cheat them all, and | am very surprised at the 
thirst of the L[andgrave] that he may give justice to the 
man, contrary to the empire, and write and demand such 
to you lords of Mansfeld. 

Therefore, | don't know what the royal family should 
do, but they would like to send a friendly reminder to 
them, that they should proceed with good intentions, 
considering the circumstances of the things that the 
realm and the authorities have done in this matter, so that 
they do not fall into danger or disgrace and into grave 
and careful defamation. For even if we remain silent 
here, one can also find people outside in the realm who 
attack both the Landgrave and Duke of Brunswick 1) and 
all of them with writings, as the rebels against royal 
majesty (as they are also in this) and decorate that part 
in such a way that the Landgrave should wish that he had 
never seen Wdurtemberg, as | would like to do so 
masterfully. They have become mad, do not see at all 
that they do not stand with the one from Wirtemberg as 
with a ruling prince 2c. 

Such will E. G. graciously accept from me as a 
subservient service. Hiemit GOtt befehlt.

Grace and peace in the Lord! We have seen the 
tragedy, we know it, which the Duke of Wirtemberg is 
bringing on the track for you, my dear Johann, but you be 
strong and do not fear. "It is not so evil as they would like

it, which | am sorry for; but so that you may also retract 
[this retraction, you must again

several times in his proverbs for his tyranny, with mention of the 
name. 

3) On July 18, Philip of Hesse had written to the Elector John 
land complained about the injustices that Luther and his family had 
committed against princely persons. He not only complained that 
Luther himself had attacked his father-in-law, Duke George of 
Saxony, with words of shame, but also that Eisleben had now, in 
lhis proverbs, which he had recently let go out, "harshly attacked 
he good Duke Ulrich of Wirtemberg, who had been chased away, 
with several words of shame and untruth" 2c. At the same time, 
he Landgrave wrote to Agricola. The latter made a humble 
lapology by letter on July 24 and thanked him for the "grace that 
such a high person as the Landgrave considered him worthy to 
punish him for his foolishness. (Kawerau, "Joh. Agricola," p. 110

To the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, together with the

Since Zwingli and his followers often referred to sayings of the 
church fathers concerning the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, 
Luther and his followers handed over to the landgrave this 
defense compiled from the fathers. - This letter is mentioned in 
Melanchthon's report on the Marburg discussion, St. Louis

Nachrichten, vol. Il, p. 349; in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 508 and in the

E. F. G. have heard how the ancient Scriptores, 
namely Augustine, in this action, that Christ has a true 
body, that a body occupies a space, that sacraments are 
signs. Such extensive and strange sayings, which the 
Fathers spoke in other places than in the Last Supper, 
and in other matters than in the Lord's Supper, are 
nevertheless drawn to the Sacrament, from which nothing 
can be concluded about this matter. For none of these 
sayings says this publicly, that Christ's body may not be 
in the supper. But because we have not heard other 
sayings of the ancients, in which their opinion is clearly 
expressed, and which are actually and solely about this 
matter, we have not been able, for the sake of our 
conscience, to refrain from informing God of such 
sayings, and for God's sake we ask in all humility that God 
read and move them. The matter is not so small as they 
think, but concerns God's honor and all our souls. 

Therefore, it is necessary that we be careful and not 
fall away from the words of the Gospel through human 
reason or strange, unrhymed sayings; for F. F. G. will find 
that the ancients taught no differently than how the words 
of the Gospel sounded and how we teach. Now E. F. G., 
from his high Christian and princely intellect, with which 
E. F. G., praise be to God, is abundantly endowed, can 
well judge for himself how difficult it is to depart from the 
words of the Gospel, and from the entire old church, 
without sufficient cause. How this will be accounted for 
will be found in the turning away. 

We have also indicated here where to find the 
sayings, so that one may easily find them, where E. F. G. 
wants to have the whole speech recited in one saying, 
and see that not only spiritual use is spoken of, but clearly 
the outward. For our opponent wants to interpret such 
sayings in terms of spiritual use, because the sixth 
chapter of John is often referred to. Johannis is often 
referred to. Now the ancients often spoke of the 
sacrament in the same chapter and indicated their 
opinion of external use.

Hilarii de trinitate L. VIII. (c. 13.) 
Here one sees how he speaks that Christ is truly and 
naturally received, not only spiritually. 


Chrysostom. in Joh. Homil. XLV. 

We have received the fruit of our good deeds re ipsa, 
etc. Here it is clear that we have not been inculcated by 
love alone, but re ipsa. 

See also Chrysostom. Homil. 83, where you will 
find his opinion on the length. 


Cyprian. L. |. ep. 2. 
Which we admonish and irritate 2c. 


Irenaeus, D. IV. cap. 34. 

How can they know that the bread is the sacrament 
2c. 

In these words Irenaeus punishes the heretics who 
taught against the divinity of Christ, and thus wants to 
conclude: If Christ were not true God, he would not be in 
many places. So it follows that his opinion is that Christ is 
bodily in the sacrament. 

After this he also says: How do they say that the flesh 
perishes? 2c. Here it is clear that the flesh is eaten. 

Cyprianus says in quodam sermone de coena 
Domini that as Christ has two natures, divine and 
human, so in the Sacrament are the bread and the body 
of Christ. Videantur caetera. 

Vulgarius" in Matth. speaks with clear wor 
ten: Christ said: This is my body, not: This is my body's 
sign, so that one understands that his true body is there; 
and this opinion he often puts in other evangelists and in 
Paul. Now Vulgarius is old, and among the Greeks he is 
one of the best teachers. 

In John XV, Cyril clearly says that we are united to 
Christ not only through love, but also bodily. Item, with 
natural usage, and gives an example of wax put to other 
wax and poured into it. 

One also has two books in Ambrosio, de mysteriis 
initiand. and de sacramentis, in which our opinion is 
clearly written. 


1) Vulgarius == Bulgarius is Theophylactus. 


Letters from the year 1529. No. 1457. 


1365 


Our opponent answers that one does not know 
whether the book is de sacramentis Ambrosii. But so 
one may solviren what one wants. There are many 
indications that it is Ambrosii, and even if it is not 
Ambrosii, it is known that it is very old, and is allegorized 
in Decretis and otherwise as an old scripture. 


This is what we wanted to report to E. F. G. in our 
humble opinion; for although our faith should stand on 
God's Word alone, it is nevertheless comforting to know 
that our faith has witness in the church. It is a stupid thing 
to have a conscience: therefore, in such great matters, 
not to act freely, and without the clear word of God, 
nothing new should be done. 

But that our opponent thinks that they have reason 
enough for their doctrine, we are concerned that they 
have not yet been highly challenged in conscience, and 
well consider that they mean well; but it will be found that 
their arguments do not do enough for conscience, 
contrary to the quality of the words: Hoc est corpus 
meum. 

They have two main arguments. The first, John 6, 
rejects external usufruct, therefore it cannot be held that 
Christ would have commanded external usufruct in the 
sacrament, as he rejected it before. This argument does 
not enforce anything more, if it has already been tossed 
about for a long time, than that external administration is 
rejected without faith; for Christ teaches in the same 
chapter that one must believe in him, that eating flesh in 
himself will not help, but that faith helps. So Christ there 
urges faith, and does not order an outward work; but 
afterward in the supper he orders the outward work: this 
we also ought to keep, and not despise his order, and not 
interpret the words to our liking. 

The other argument is that because Christ has a true 
body, the same body must be in one place, and could not 
be here and there. This argument is not from Scripture, 
but is reason. For how do we know that Christ cannot be 
here and elsewhere? So reason is not able to stand 
against God's word in the challenge and judgment of 
God. 

These are the most noble arguments, so they 


1366 Letters from the year 1529. 
lead. We do not know how to rely on this, and we ask the 
Lord for God's sake that the Lord, as a Christian prince, 
take this matter to heart and not allow anything to be 
done that might result in further annoyance and trouble. 
E. F. G. see what mischief follows from contempt of the 
Sacrament. We also ask, in all humility, that your grace 
grant us this simple document, which we are compelled 
by our conscience to hand over to you, and we are 
grateful to you. F. G. and are always ready to serve him 
humbly.

Christ that you send as soon as possible the things which 
you taught us in Eisenach to be extremely credible and 
which we are asking for, namely, about that monk who 
died in the ban 1) and prophesied that it would happen 
that those who were present would see and hear the one 
who taught what he had taught and held. This history, | 
say, see that thou write and send it to us in full, many, 
whole, and superfluous words, omitting nothing: of the 
book that was buried under the bricks, and what the 
name of the priest was, and where he was that obtained 
this book; for thou knowest that | am much concerned in

nothing, and love me as | love thee. For it was for your 
sake alone (so that | would not leave you grieved) that | 
preached the sermon in Gotha when | left, 2) whereas 
otherwise | would not have preached it even if all others 
had insisted on it. So you again make it possible for me 
to enjoy this ministry of yours, to use it, to be glad of it 
and to benefit from it. For | desire very much, indeed, | 
glow the more with desire to have this [history], the 
further away | am. | hope and promise myself to you, as 
| am guilty and you worthy of it. And if it cannot be done 
otherwise, may you send a messenger at my expense.

Nicolaus, | am compelled to write. For | thought they 
would stay here longer; otherwise | would have written 
more to you and to Cordatus, especially about the 
Turkish War, which is rightly upsetting Germany. For we 
too have earned this wrath of God; and those who have 
earned it neither repent nor mend, but continue. | am 
issuing an admonitory sermon, "A Sermon Against the 
Turk." M. Philip and Jonas are preparing a booklet on the 
same matter. 2) You work on it, that your hard, 
unbelieving and_ stiff-necked Zwickauers seriously 
believe, fear and tremble before this rod and wrath of 
God. It will not be a joke, but the final wrath of God, in 
which at the same time the world will come to an end, and 
Christ will come to destroy this Gog and Magog [Ezek. 
Cap. 38 and 39], and to free His own. For everything is 
fulfilled in the Scriptures, except that we are sure that our 
humble petitions will be able to do something even 
against this Turk, who will not only plague us Germans 
this winter, but to the end of the world, as Daniel chapter 
7 says. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me. | will fight

which, although small in appearance, was of great 
importance (efficaci). This is what the prayers of the 
blessed brought about, so that those who were so 
confused did not bring up anything of importance 
(frigerent), and were humbled. To God be praise and 
glory. 

Yesterday we heard that on the eve of a festival 1) the 
Turk had left Vienna for Hungary by a great miracle of 
God. For after he had stormed the city almost for the 
twentieth time, he undermined the ground in three 
places, put powder in it, threw it apart and made 
breaches, but by no force could he move his army to 
enter, since it had been made despondent by God, so 
that they rather let themselves be stabbed by the leaders 
than to have undertaken this last storm to enter. So it is 
thought that, fearing the great guns and our future army, 
he departed in dismay. Others disagree. God has fought 
for us in this year in such a way that one can grasp it with 
one's hands. He [the Turk] has lost 26,000 men; of ours, 
they say, 6000 have fallen, who have gone down by 
losses. This is what | wanted to tell you, if you have 
nothing else, so that we may give thanks and pray with 
one another. For the Turk, who has become our 
neighbor, will not let us have peace forever. 

But since you ask whether our prince is certainly at 
liberty to unite with the ungodly and the adversaries of 
the Word, we believe it to be so, because it is a question 
here of common defense. It would be a different matter if 
the question were whether one should start war or enter 
into alliances where nothing is yet in the works. For 
likewise 2) if the house of the wicked is burning, likewise 
if your enemy is hungry, feed him, help him; in time of 
need you must also do good to your enemies. Be at ease 
in the Lord and pray for me. Given on the day before 
Simonis and Jude [Oct. 27] 1529.

Grace and peace in Christ! We have enough news to 
write, my dear Jacob, and more than enough. 

If you have not heard from the Turks how they broke 
into Germany, you will hear it from the note which | gave 
to Bruno 2) that he should copy it for you. Austria is 
almost devastated. Vienna is, by a miracle of the arm, 
not taken, but still unrecovered.

urgently destroyed, the neighboring villages all burned, 
more than a hundred thousand people killed or captured. 
He did the same in Hungary. Germany is full of traitors 
favorable to the Turk. In addition to these evils, Emperor 
Carl threatens us much more cruelly and has decided to 
rage against us than the Turk. Thus we have both 
emperors, the one in the East and the one in the West, 
as our enemies. 

This is how the contempt and hatred for the Gospel is 
avenged. | hope that the day will come that will put an 
end to all hopefuls. That is why, | believe, the devils rage 
so much as at the last hour. This is the hour when Christ 
is weak and wrestling with death. 

You see to it in your church that you pray diligently 
and fervently for the faith of all who have suffered or will 
suffer either imprisonment or death, that Christ may be 
strengthened in us all until He rises in power and glory, 
Amen. 

They say that the Turk is camped in Hungary not far 
from Vienna and will return around the time of spring. 
And they boast that Emperor Carl will come to Germany, 
but no one fears him. For if he should do anything by 
force, there is danger that he will corrupt himself and all 
his priests from the bottom up. For there is counsel and 
help ready, if God is not against it, which is strong 
enough for the destruction of all monasteries and 
convents, that it is not safe for them to undertake 
anything with contempt for the peace and patience of 
ours, unless perhaps some fate 3) urges them to hasten 
their own hour. 

My house is quite well. But |, a sinner, am the object 
and the goal of the devils, who pursue me without end 
and play their game with me. Christ save and free me; 
you will help me to achieve this through faithful prayer. 
The grace of God be with you, amen. Greet your Eva in

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. 
Nicolaus Hausmann, the extremely faithful bishop 
of the church at Zwickau, his very dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Be strong in the Lord, my 
dear Nicolaus, and do not fear the Turk too much. Christ 
is alive, and according to the vision of Daniel, which Philip 
and Jonas now publish, 1) it is to be hoped that he will 
not seize Germany, although he will pluck us and avenge 
the contempt of the gospel. For it is a miracle in a hurry 
that the Turk has left the place and the camp, and there 
his presumption is broken. The day of judgment is at 
hand, and it will destroy both Gog the Turk and Magog 
the Pope, the latter the temporal enemy, the latter the 
spiritual enemy of Christ. 

But that certain people call you and mock you with the 
biting and harsh name "the little saint" (Sanctulum), | 
wish you extraordinary luck that you are worthy of such a 
great hatred of Satan, who, since he is not able to do 
anything else, at least exercises the venom of his tongue 
on you. But you would act most rightly if you again 
mocked his poisonous impotence and made him kiss the 
dung. For you cannot injure him more sensitively and take 
revenge more gloriously than by laughing at his impotent 
and powerless stings and bites with the greatest glee.

To the honorable and wise Philippus Rosenecker of 
Jena, my favorable good friends. 

Grace and peace in Christ. My good friend! As | told 
you in Jena about the marriage case, so | still say: 
because Jeronymus Malter, 2) master gunsmith, her 
husband, is still alive and is with King Janus, she cannot 
stay with him with good pleasures. For King Janus is one 
with the Turk, therefore her husband is safe. Therefore, 
my advice is that you or she write to the husband. 

2) Malter was captured in the battle of Mohacz on August 29, 
1526 by the Bassa Karra and was given by him to King John 
Zapolya (Janos), who used him as a gunsmith. In July 1528 he 
wrote a letter to his brother-in-law Georg Moser in Neusaiza, in 
which he asked his wife to come to him and enclosed six gold 
florins as travel money. However, the letter arrived only in 1529, 
three weeks after the wife had entered into a second marriage 
with the pastor Georg JUingkling in Neustadt an der Orla at the 
beginning of the year. Luther had already talked about this 


marriage case with her relative Rosenecker in Jena on October 
12, and now repeats this in writing.

the Elector of Saxony, for a writing to E. F. G., which | 
have done, and am of good hope that it is or will be done. 
Although | like the text of Emser's testament, as it is 
almost entirely my text, and is also stolen from me from 
word to word, but his poisonous additions, glosses and 
annotations from his envious head, added to my 
annoyance, would be dangerous, for the sake of which 
such a testament of Emser is most often printed: 3) | also 
humbly ask that E. F. G. would not allow such printing for 
the sake of the Gospel of Christ and for the salvation of 
all souls (where it is possible), considering that if such 
printing were to go out through the grace or forbearance 
of E. F. G., Satan would afterwards stir and complain to 
E. F. G.'s conscience, as if they had allowed such great 
harm to souls, so that they would not have prevented it, 
since they certainly had space and time. However, | hope 
and pray that Christ will continue to instruct E. F.G., asa 
lover of the Word of God, to do what is dear to His divine 
will, amen. 

E. F. G. will graciously grant me my diligent, but 
nevertheless necessary and good opinion letter. Hiemit 
GOtt befohlen, Amen. 1529, on Saturday after Catherina

3) In 1529, clergymen (not Emser himself, who died already in 
1527) contacted the Loll Brothers to print Emser's Testament in 
Lower Saxon, so that Luther's New Testament would be 
displaced by it. What is left of the print, however, shows an 
improvement in the sense of the brothers, namely a close 
connection to the Vulgate (also echoes of the Liibeck Bible 1494), 
therefore their text is further away from Emser than the latter is 
from Luther. - On Dec. 18, 1529, Duke Heinrich issued a 
prohibition of printing to the Rostock City Council, whereupon the 
Council forbade the printing. The printer Joh. von Holt now 
negotiated with the brother and co-regent of the Duke, who 
remained Catholic, and printing began quietly in 1530 and 
continued until the Acts of the Apostles, when the Rector of the 
Briiderhaus, Martin Hillermann, and the printer were accused of 
a conspiracy against the Council and its Syndicus, Joh. 
Oldendorp, and were imprisoned and only released in 1532 after 
a vow of pardon, but the printed sheets found were confiscated. 
Only defective copies are in the Rostock and Stuttgart libraries, 
individual sheets in Dorpat.

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn

known to me what S. G., the landgrave, has written to E. 
C.F. G., and S. F. G. may suffer that E. C. F. G. hear my 
objection inside, E. C. F. G. thereupon request that | 
report my objection in writing: 

First of all, this is my advice, that E. C. F. G. together 
with other princes and cities, who are of an undivided 
faith, should give the Emperor a submissive answer and 
with all humility ask for peace, look to His Imperial 
Majesty 2); as | then hear that the councils are to meet 
shortly at Nuremberg for this purpose; for the mandates, 
to which the Emperor's answer refers or draws (which he 
gave to the embassy), have not yet gone out. And since 
(as the Scripture says) the King's heart is in God's hands, 
it is quite possible that the Emperor's counsel has 
changed by God's grace since the time the 3) Embassy 
was in their hands, and that His Majesty will not leave this 
way. And who knows whether all this, which has 
happened so far and_ still happens, therefore 
miraculously hinders and turns God to try our faith? 
Should such an answer be given to the Emperor, which 
might be considered harsh and defiant, then a

The emperor's will and commandment are always at the 
disposal of the emperor. Thus, it is also our duty before 
God to act against the emperor as our sovereign with 
humility, as much as possible, and not to defy God, for it 
is always God's will and commandment: You shall honor 
the king. 1 Petr. 2. 

On the other hand: Even if the emperor were of the 
mind that he wants to proceed by force against the 
gospel, without conciliation and without interrogation, 
one can still not in good conscience go to battle, God 
granting that the emperor gives either an ungracious 
answer or no answer at all. The reason is first of all that 
such a thing is unreasonable and also against natural 
law. For going into the field and putting up a defense shall 
not be done unless there is physical force or unavoidable 
necessity. But such going forth beforehand and wanting 
to defend oneself is not considered an act of necessity, 
but an irritation and defiance against those who still sit 
still and have done nothing. Now it is obvious that King 
Magistrate has not yet issued any mandates against 
these princes, and whether they have already gone out, 
or would go out, would not yet have been the issue. 
Between such and all, however, much water can run, and 
God may well find many means, perhaps also by their 
part, to act according to peace. Therefore, if the emperor 
were an equal 5) prince, one could not start a war or go 
to battle for the above reasons. And if it should ever be 
thought that one should trust in God, but not despise the 
means that one can have at the time, so that one does 
not tempt God; all this is true, but one must not devise 
such means oneself, but suffer and wait for the means 
that God presents, and then not let them go and follow 
our conceit, and also that they be means that may be 
used with God and not against God. Otherwise, where 
one so anxiously seeks means, one is certainly too close 
to trusting in God. For this is what the Jews would have 
said in ancient times, when they made alliances with 
foreign kings and pretended that they trusted in God;

But they sought means through such alliance, so they 
were severely punished for it. Now military action would 
be an unnecessary and distant means at this time. Item, 
the emperor is the lord and sovereign of these princes. 
Now, of course, no one would want his subjects, if they 
were subject to him, to act in such a way as is done here 
against the emperor, and would actually be a rebellious 
and disobedient piece. Therefore, it is advisable to use 
the diligence one has to seek means of resistance, as one 
finds means, first all humility and submission to the 
Emperor. Mt. 1) Then God will give grace (especially if the 
princes and we will ask him for it with right earnestness) 
and our worries will find good counsel, as he promises us 
and does not fulfill Ps. 55: "Cast your concern on God. He 
will provide for you." 1 Pet. 5: "He resisteth the proud, and 
giveth grace unto the humble." 

On the other hand, it would also be a futile means, 
even dangerous and harmful. For | would bet on it if we 
were already in the field in the present war. How, then, if 
the emperor sits still or stays outside and lets us wear 
ourselves out in the field and grow tired of fighting? What 
would we have gained by this but insurmountable 
damage, plus the disfavor and displeasure of the whole 
world? And with that, we would have enraged the emperor 
first and foremost, and at the same time given him every 
reason to go on an emergency revenge by appealing to 
the empire. Then one would probably find scribes who 
should dress up our things to disfavor, to annoyance, to 
disgrace the gospel, to disfavor, and again make up the 
emperor's things so that he must be a vain angel and we 
must be a vain devil. 

Thirdly, it would be too close to the opponents and 
princes who are in the empire if they and their poor 
subjects were to be seized immediately by the emperor. 
For | hear that it has been written to the emperor to put off 
the estates of the empire to a peace. And if they should 
be attacked about it, both God and the world would be 
highly angered once again, and we would be condemned.

Therefore, my concern is that the nobility to go into 
the field will remain away, unless there are other needs 
and things, and because with the ordered way one can 
always ask HM for peace with all submission. This is my

Grace and peace from God, our Father, through

myself from guilt, | am sending you the history of the 
Minorite Johann Ilten, not in its entirety, but several 
small pieces, as many as | was able to fish out of the 
old monks and the tattered remnants of his writings 
and scrape together. Of all his souvenirs and books, 
however, of which there was an enormous quantity, 
and of which, no doubt, some are still preserved by 
the monks who hid them when they were destroyed, | 
was only able to obtain these fragments,

and certainly not without great diligence and art. For 
these monks conceal and hide with extraordinary zeal 
the blood and the memory of this and other martyrs of 
Christ, so that it does not cry out from the earth to the 
Lord. But they take this trouble in vain, because he will 
come in the near future who will demand all the blood 
of all the righteous that has been shed on earth from 
the wicked. 

This lIlten was formerly so great among the 
Lieflanders to whom he preached that all who had the 
privilege of seeing and hearing him thought that they 
heard an angel from heaven. But from this book the 
monks have torn out some 1) leaves at the place 
which | have indicated by a small paper inserted, 
where, as can be seen from the previous leaf which is 
still left, 2) that man had described his history and his 
martyr's sufferings. Among other things, however, the 
preface of this book seems to me to be a testimony of 
a not evil heart, although | would have liked him to 
have either written or known more certain things about 
the most salvific and necessary doctrine of 
justification. Rome he interprets several times, that it 
is the whore in Revelation, and that this kingdom will 
cease around the year of Christ 1514, as can be seen 
from his circles (rotulis). He was extremely annoyed 
by the distinction that the monks first dreamt up: that 
the religious were different Christians than the secular 
ones; he wanted that no other worship of God was 
salvific than only Christian worship, without which the 
monks were outside of salvation. What he has held, 
and frequently discussed in the circles and elsewhere 
in this book, of the empire of the Mahometists or 
Turks, of their victories and wars, which are to be 
propagated to Europe, so that the consummate 
wickedness of the Europeans and their godlessness 
may receive due punishment; Then, what he thought 
of the kingdom of the restored (reformatorum) 
Christians and of the tyranny of Antichrist and the 
kingdom of Christ here on earth, and of the end of the 
world around the year of the Lord 1651, and beyond 
that the account of the heavenly book does not go, 
and with which scriptural passages he proved this, 
you will be able to accept more easily than |. For | think 
that he did not say anything about the tyranny of the 
Antichrist and the kingdom of Christ here on earth. For 
| think that he does not write very probable things. But 
| cannot avoid it, 


1) Instead of (referring to monachi) we have assumed, 
according to your Bremen manuscript and Heumann's copy of the 
original in the Parerga, quaedam (referring to folia). 

2) The word: apparet is the complement of Heumann. 





| do not see that he is lying about the fact that he has 
set the end of Rome around the year of the Lord 1514, 
and that he has extended the empire of the Turk over 
Europe from the year of Christ 600 to the year 1570. 
But you will know through the spirit of Christ that is in 
you what kind of spirit it was that inspired these things 
and brought them together. But | beg you, my most 
revered Luther, that you return this book of Jltens after 
you have read it. For | have vowed to the monk that | 
will keep it carefully, and if he should demand it, | will 
also send it back. Take care that he cannot accuse me 
of lying, for | would certainly be very ashamed of such 
an offense. But since the raging of the papists against 
Christ does not cease, | would like the Spirit in you and 
others not to cease to punish their sins, although they 
are already sinning so much that there is no hope that 
these offenses and the terrible sin of blasphemy will 
ever be forgiven. Nevertheless, since Christ is now 
dying on the cross everywhere, | think it will not be 
unreasonable for us to cry out with the centurion that 
Christ is suffering improperly and that he is righteous. 
| have written these three quatrains, which | have sent 
before the history of Jlten, so that you may see that | 
gladly want to confess Christ's innocence with you and 
threaten the fury of those with destruction, that they 
will quickly receive their terrible punishments from the 
Lord and that God's vengeance will come upon them. 
By the way, if something else seems to suit you better, 
use these papers for any purpose (pro tergendis 
natibus) or for lighting fires. 

Nothing new is reported here, except that it is said 
that the emperor is becoming very burdensome to 
Christ. But you know what a reward his exceedingly 
powerful enemies have received. He will undoubtedly 
be broken like a potter's vessel when he comes up 
against this stone. Be confident, | have overcome the 
world, "which is probably more, greater, wiser, 
stronger, angrier, because devil, hell, Turk, pope, king, 
bishop, all nations are their war relatives", how much 
more have | overcome, yes, overcome the emperor. 
May the grace of Christ keep you His Church, Amen. 
Respectfully greet the comrade of all your tribulations, 
"Kathen von Bora". Gotha 1529, Thursday after the 
Feast of St. Andrew [Dec. 2]. Yours, Friedrich

Enclosure. ") 


When | had closed the letter, Siebeleben's bishop 
2) sent me a letter from Johann Corner, whom | had 
commissioned to investigate Ilten's history with the 
monks at Arnstadt, which contained these words: 
"After the investigation had been done in a careful 
manner, our hired scout said: | have recognized that 
these brothers do not want to confess the truth, 
although | had also approached them (he said) in an 
exceedingly clever manner. But they confessed that 
IIten had not been locked up in eternal prison, but had 
been kept apart for the sake of the leprosy, so that he 
would not infect others with his disease, and he had 
not lived in seclusion until the day of his departure. [In 
passing: See the monkish deception. Ilten was never 
leprous in the body]. After many things they also 
added that he had had a strong spirit of prophecy, and 
that he had often occupied himself with the 
prophecies of Johann Lichtenberg 3). Among other 
things, the monks said that he had also predicted that 
it would happen that no monastery in Eisenach would 
be maintained; he had also predicted many other 
things, of which today everyone sees that everything 
has come true. | have learned this from our hired 
scout, as well as other things that are not relevant to 
the matter, which it is not necessary to explain. | am 
sending this to you, dear brother, so that you may 
report it to our Frederick 4) as soon as possible." So

Dear, dear faithful one! We have no doubt that you

done against ours, the princes, princes and cities, who 
are attached to the holy gospel, which they call your 
doctrine, and to the protestation before the next

to their sovereignty with such high, humble,

Christian, honorable, just and lawful entreaties, and 
especially how their sovereigns have had them 
imprisoned in the inn. The same also applies to the 
unceremonious,® serious answer given by her M. to

serious, vehement and ungracious disposition 
towards us, the above-mentioned Electors, Princes, 
Estates, you and others who are inclined to the 
Gospel, is to be understood without obscurity, actually 
and certainly, and also that, where her M. has done 
something ungracious to damp down the protestation, 
it is to be understood that her M. has done something 
ungracious to damp down the protestation. would do 
something ungracious to dampen and suppress the 
Gospel, it would be difficult to do so, although we have 
no doubt that the almighty God, who out of mercy and 
grace has again given us his word so abundantly and 
graciously, will also preserve it powerfully against all 
men. But nevertheless, the ways and means given to 
us by God and useful for this purpose are not to be 
despised. Since there is now and necessity demands 
that help against the Turks be sought from all, and 
especially also from us, the above-mentioned Estates, 
by Our Lady and her brother and others, since our, the 
Estates’, help is not the least, but among the highest 
and most noble, we mean, if we unanimously decide 
and do not grant or give ourselves any help, that 
beforehand Our Lady has assured us of peace and 
that she will support us in our efforts. If we 
unanimously decide and do not grant or give help, 
then we mean that the Catholic Church has assured 
us beforehand of peace and that it wants to let us stay 
with the Gospel unimpaired (which we consider 
Christian in our understanding, and that it is 
unpleasant and unprovable), it would nevertheless 
move the Catholic Church in such an objection, and 
we are of good, comforting confidence in God that we 
would receive it and that thereby much harm would be 
prevented; and we do not consider it otherwise than 
that you, with your teaching, finally

figure, and what is best, adorned with a good character

Martin Luther wishes Eoban Hesse salvation. 


Grace and peace in Christ! Since | had seen that you, 
my dear Eoban, were gladly and with pleasure practicing 
your poetry on some psalms which had been given to 
you by Philip, and |, who love the Psalter very much, took 
great pleasure in seeing this Hebrew poet clothed with 
Latin poetry, | have often thought of giving you some 
more of this pleasant occupation, of expounding to you 
some more of this pleasant occupation, but | have been 
so often prevented and beset by other troubles, that it 
has not hitherto been granted me to tell you a psalm 
which you should make more sweet to me for my prayer 
and love by your poetry. For | did not want to name a 
mere (NUduM == without explanations) psalm, and | ask 
that you exercise your poetic gift on it. Not as if | doubted 
that all psalms are already sufficiently known to you, but 
because | am selfish in these matters, and would like to 
see my thoughts interspersed, so that the psalm would 
be all the more familiar and pleasant to me, than if 
absolutely nothing of my thoughts, to which | am 
accustomed, were included. Therefore, | now finally ask 
that you, if you get leisure and allow your soul rest, may 
form this 118th Psalm into a Latin poem for me. 3) For 
so that you do not stray far from my thoughts, | send you 
at the same time several short explanations (scholia), 
which | have noted privately, so that | may imprint the 
Psalm, which is extremely dear to me, more sweetly and 
firmly in my memory. Whether you want to copy the copy 
or send it back is up to you. But | would like you to 
understand these requests of mine in such a way that 
you will not hear me, let it be with great pleasure, and 
you will, as it were, send it back to me. 


3) The Psalm edited by Hessus has in the above print the 
superscription: /In Psalmum CxXIlll [sic] cum interspersis 
(quantum cum decore fieri potuit, et personae dignitas permisit) 
Martini Lutheri Scholiis, per Eob. Hessum latino carmine reddita 
paraphrasis. - Hessus gave Luther's Schélten to Wenceslaus 
Link, who translated them into German and published them 
under the title: "Der Hundert vund achtzehendt Psalm, niit kurtzer 
auBlegnng oder verzeicbnuB D. Martin Luther's.... Wentzeslaus 
Linck. 1530." At the end: "Gedruckt zu Nirenberg durch Jobst 
Gutknecht." 3 sheets in 8. This interpretation is different uon the 
"beautiful Confitemini," St. Louis edition, vol. V, 1174 ff, and is 
not yet found in any edition, so we have not been able to bring it.

him the right to marry. Therefore, our humble and diligent 
request to E. C. G. is that E. C. G. graciously allow such 
a change to the headman and administrator, in view of 
the fact that it is a good and Christian undertaking that 
such a large household can hardly be administered 
without a female. In addition, the virgin, whom he was

that equity may now prevail in the same for the

request to you that you do not make the matters 
pending, but think with diligent consideration on the 
ways that they may finally be recorded and passed, 
also that you do not allow the parties any dangerous

thereupon. But the matrimonial cases, so pending, 
you want to discuss for the prevention of further 
aggravation by reasonable Christian instruction, and 
if you do not want to wait for the same matrimonial 
cases everywhere, you want to send them to our

Luther and Melanchthon to the Coburg Council. 


Even before the request of the Coburg City Council for a 
schoolmaster (No. 1476), dated Nov. 12, 1529, had arrived in 
Wittenberg, Melanchthon had already sent a letter of request to 
the city council on Nov. 12, 1529.

Coburg wrote again in the meantime, which is answered here (not 
to No. 1476). At the same time (Dec. 25), Melanchthon also wrote 
to Fesel that Héfler was willing to take over the school (Corp. Ref.,

us to thank you diligently on his behalf, as is due, and to 
ascribe the following opinion, that he is inclined to accept 
the school in Coburg, and for this reason, after the end of 
the present Leipzig market, to move out’) . But because 
you add in your writing that he would rather study here 
longer, this should not be contrary to you: he wants to 
have this completely stated to you, as his lords and 
sponsors; for although he is inclined to accept the school, 
he still wants to show himself obedient to you, and if it 
would be your concern that he should study here longer, 
and you determine a certain time and study for him, he 
will keep obediently and follow you. From all this you will 
show him your mind, if he comes out with God's help. We 
are always willing to serve you kindly. God keep you.

Grace and peace in Christ! Dear Cautious, dear Lord 
and Friend! What they have done in Eisenach with your 
son-in-law, to deprive both of the brewing rights and the 
school office, has not pleased me and Mag. Accordingly, 
we have both written to the captain at Warpurg 2) in the 
hope that M. Scholl, your oath-bearer, should be retained 
in the school office, for although their nobility does not 
grow out of envy, as cannot be well believed, there are 
not so many people available at present that one should 
choose and supply them with a vain Philipp Mel. or the 
like according to their thoughts. Therefore | ask you to 
admonish good friends and citizens of mine with the 
indicated, if necessary, writing, that they help resist envy 
and let themselves be based on Mag. Scholl 3) so that 
they do not experience a change that makes them regret 
it. For a thing is soon changed, but not so soon improved. 
Change is bad, therefore everyone should suffer and 
keep what he has,

Concerns to Brenz about the death penalty of 
heretics. 
(Fragment.) 


Printed by Hartmann and Jager, Joh. Brenz,. Vol. |, p. 301 and 
in Erl. Briefw., vol. VII, p. 211. 


In a concern about the means by which the authorities should 
defend themselves against sects, written at the end of 1529, 
Brenz says that he asked Luther for advice about the death 
penalty for heresy, and that Luther answered him thus: 


| am hard to judge by blood, even if there is enough 
guilt; in addition, | am frightened by the succession of the 
example, which we saw with the papists and before 
Christ's time with the Jews, where it was set to kill the 
seducing teachers: [Now it has come to pass that not only 
the holy prophets and innocent people have been killed 
by virtue of such a statute, so that the godless authorities 
have helped themselves, and have made false teachers 
and heretics, as much and as many as they have longed 
for. The same would be true of ours, where one could 
prove by example that it is fair to kill false teachers, just 
as innocent blood is shed for guilty among the papists. 
Therefore, false teachers should not be killed; it is enough 
to expel them; even if the descendants wanted to abuse 
such punishment, they would sin again and harm only 
themselves.

To Mr. Conrad Cordatus, minister of the word at the 

church in Zwickau. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | wish you happiness 
with all my heart, my dear Cordatus, that you have 
become a father through the birth of a son. May the Lord 
be with him, that you may have joy in him all the days of 
your life, amen. | will send my testimony as soon as it 
comes, in which | will acknowledge that | am godfather 
1) as you have asked, so that he may remember me 
when your son is grown up. 

The papists triumph and write (scriptillant) to each 
other and say: The Savior is coming! namely the 
emperor. But oh woe! (hu) a hard savior who will devour 
them at the same time. | believe that you have heard that 
two bishops (one of whom is the bishop of Trent) have 
been sent by the pope to Germany with the permission 
of the emperor, with such an order that they should hand 
over to Ferdinand against the Turks all the gold and silver 
that is presently in the churches in all of Germany. If this 
was not enough (for what should be enough for those 
people?), then they were to add the third part of all 
ecclesiastical income. If this was not enough either (as it 
cannot be enough for those who want to see Germany 
sucked dry and ruined), then they should sell castles, 
cities and all territories and hand them over to Ferdinand, 
the victor and devourer of the Turks. When this (it is 
laughable) was read out in the pulpit in Paderborn, one

council. | write for that poor prisoner in Eilenburg, Brosius 
1) Smet, who has been punished long and hard enough 
when he has transgressed. For he has committed 
nothing in the act; but if the will alone was there (which |

what the pope has offered Ferdinand through two skillful 
bishops, namely that all gold and silver in the churches 
of all Germany be handed over to him against the Turks, 
then the third part of all ecclesiastical revenues, and 
finally, if this is not enough (for when will it be enough for

The visitators announce the beginning of the visitation in 
Belzig, ask to appoint the bailiff Sebastian von K6tteritz there, if 
D. Pauli should be prevented, especially since Luther will travel 
to Wittenberg after eight or ten days. They ask for witness money 
and suggest D. Bugenhagen as Luther's temporary deputy.

Most Serene, Highborn Prince and Lord! Your 
electoral graces are always preceded by our submissive

order of E. ch. G.'s command we are willing, by divine 
grace and help, to travel to Beltitz on the next Thursday 
[Jan. 13] and to approach the visitation of the place. 
However, if we are concerned that E. ch. G. might 
demand and use Doctor Benedict Pauli in the middle of 
the work, in case such would occur, we humbly request 
that E. ch. G. should write to Bastian von Kotteritsch, 
bailiff at Bitterfelt, and order that he then be used at our 
request in the doctor's place, considering that perhaps |, 
Martinus Luther, might also travel to Wittenberg again 
after eight or ten days. 

Because we also have a shortage of food, we ask that 
E. ch. G. to provide us with it and have it given to Johan 
von Taubenheim. This we want to do for the sake of E. 
ch. G. in submissive obedience at all times. Date

us by faith, which comes by grace to those who befor 
were terrified by the law and, crushed by th

to tell others about grace, for they grasp only the outwar 
change of customs, with which they tickle themselves fo 
an hour, but soon, as sated people, they are disguste 
with all sound doctrine. But the change of the ungodl

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear 
devotee! It has come to us many times in the past few 
weeks that you should have stopped preaching in our 
city and parish church in Wittenberg, which has almost 
distressed us, and especially because we cannot 
know why this is so, whether it has happened because 
of your incapacity or because of other things that have 
burdened you. 3) For if you 


3) We do not know the actual cause. Mathesius writes about it 
in the 7th sermon (Mathesius, Luthers Leben, St. Louis Edition, p. 
115): "In the beginning of the 30th year, his zeal burns against his 
own parishioners, gives them a fierce sermon of repentance, 
almost like the Lord Christ cried out against his Capernaites and 
Bethsaidites, because God's word wanted to become a mockery 
and ridicule to him, as the prophet Jeremiah complains miserably 
about his listeners in the 20th chapter. He also decided that he 
would no longer preach in God's name. So also the doctor let 
himself be heard publicly this time, never to preach henceforth, 
and also stopped for a while, until his zeal cooled down, or indeed 
his profession burned in his heart, so that he stood up again."

you are not able to preach often during the week 
because of your body, we would like that the burden 
could be eased for you so that you preach only one 
thing during the week, as approximately on Sunday 
during the mass. But if it would have been a burden for 
us in Wittenberg, we would not have liked to hear it, 
and it would have been quite a burden for us to hear 
that because of their clumsy behavior there should be 
a reason to slacken your preaching. Since you know 
better than we can tell you, [that] not only those of 
Wittenberg, but also ourselves, other countries and 
foreign people, are concerned that you do not stop 
preaching, our especially gracious request is that you, 
to the praise of the Almighty and to the comfort of poor 
eager people, do not completely cease or slacken your 
preaching, But, if you are at all able, preach weekly on 
Sundays at least only once, for if ours in Wittenberg 
are perhaps the cause of their clumsy nature, we are 
obliged and want to show ourselves, in which we as 
the sovereign should have understanding, with the 
help of the Almighty, that these complaints or the 
causes should be stopped. For if you should be sure 
to preach, it would cause us, as the sovereign, a great 
deal of concern for the government, and it would also 
be likely to give special pleasure to the opponents of 
the holy gospel, We will therefore graciously bas 
ourselves to you, and you will, to the praise of God an 

to our gracious will, begin to preach again next week 
and not let up on it. In this you do us a gracious favor 
and we want to recognize this in all graces and 
kindnesses towards you. Date Torgau, Tuesday after

1) This letter is undated everywhere, except in Cod. Helmst., 
where it has the date: "February 2, 1531", which De Wette 
assumed. The Cod. That the letter belongs to the year 1530 
results from the fact that the people of Strasbourg became 
citizens of the city of Zurich on Jan. 5, 1530, and thus had fallen 
away from the empire, and Luther speaks of Cardinal Wolsey as 
still living, who died on Nov. 28, 1530.

To the man venerable in the Lord, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, the extremely faithful and loud bishop 
of the church at Zwickau, his brother. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! | have nothing of news 
to report to you, my dear Nicolaus. You may have 
several. The people of Strasbourg have fallen away from 
the empire to the Swiss and want to oppose Emperor 
Carl. | have been a prophet, since | have always said that 
the spirit of the Sacramentirans is full of secret rebellion. 
It is now revealing itself. If God does not resist, they will 
give us a new mint, but to their destruction, so that they 
may receive their punishment for the violation and 
desecration of the Sacrament and the Gospel. Let the 
dead bury their dead. One rumor says the Turk is 
returning; another, Carl is going back to Spain. 
Everywhere the godless papists are seized by necessity, 
but do not go into themselves. England allows the 
gospel, with the king looking through his fingers. The 
Cardinal, 1) the demigod of England or rather of Europe, 
is condemned to eternal imprisonment. In France and 
Spain, the word is also beginning to go out. The 
Sacramentarians, after our meeting in Marburg, are 
burning more fiercely against us than ever before, for 
they are sorry that we could not be drawn into their 
abyss, and perhaps there are other things. Christ, who 
started it, will also lead it out. Farewell and pray for me.

Grace and peace in Christ! Your letter was pleasant 
to me, my dear householder, as your letters always are, 
because of the extraordinary simplicity of spirit and the 
highest benevolence towards me, of which they are 
always full. But | would like you to tell me once everything 
and anything in order that seems to be lacking in the 
church. For | am neither mindful of all things, nor do | see 
them. This | would have as a memo, and since it would 
be before my eyes, | would perhaps try to express it if the 
opportunity and leisure arose; otherwise | am disturbed 
by the most diverse matters, forget it from one day to the 
next, and the time passes. Now we are preparing Daniel 
for printing, as a consolation for this last time. We have 
also taken Jeremiah and the other [prophets] in hand. 
We will publish the New Testament at the next Frankfurt 
Fair," whereby we will, of course, arouse a new rage

Grace and peace in Christ! | believe you remember, 
my dear Spalatin, that | have already made known my 
opinion about the matter of this widow, who had been the 
wife of his uncle 2): that | could not in good conscience 
approve of such a marriage, since it seemed to be 
expressly contrary not only to Mosiah's law, which is not 
Mosiah's law as well as nature's law, but also to the civil 
laws. Ignorance or deceit, as you know, do not excuse it; 
the fact that they have lived together for a long time is not 
enough for me to weigh down my conscience with this 
deed. Let him do as he pleases, and do not ask me for 
counsel. | am moved by Paul 1 Cor. 5, which is so 
inflamed because of the stepmother that he does not 
want [such unions] to be called marriages among 
Christians, which are not considered such even among 
pagans, and he clearly calls it a more than pagan 
fornication, and separates them. He would have done the 
same in this case, and would have called it a more than 
pagan fornication, since in the customs and laws of our 
peoples there is no such example, and it appears as a 
mere abuse of evangelical freedom. According to my will, 
| would gladly be compliant with this rule: many things 
are not permitted, which are nevertheless retained after 
they have been done, but my conscience and the new 
deed leave me uncertain. There you have what my 
opinion is. Pray for

To the man to be revered, Mr. Adam Adam, the 


servant of Christ in the word of truth, his brother. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! My dear Adam, | have 
gladly heard and perceived your zeal for the truth of the 
Sacrament; but your disputation xxxx xx [?] seems 
pointed, but it has no meaning in this matter, since those 
are not moved by much stronger things. It is still my 
intention to write about the sixth chapter of John when | 
get leisure and time; you will see my work, God willing. 
By the way, that | am vehement is not to be wondered at; 
if you were what | am, you would perhaps be even more 
vehement. Different people are touched in different ways, 
therefore they are moved in different ways. You haven't 
fought any wars yet, but only watched, but as that 4) 
says: Regiment shows what kind of man one is. This for 
you.

That others take offense at our meeting in Marburg, 
they are right to do so, since they do not want to be 
edified. Since so many errors had been overcome and 
confessed by the Zwinglian party, they must rightly be 
annoyed by the fact that they postponed their opinion in 
this one article, as if it were really up to us to force those 
who have been convicted to confess. In the same way, | 
would have them be angry with Christ because he often 
convicted the Pharisees and Sadducees, and yet could 
not persuade them to confess. So despise this kind of 
people, who are looking for offences to take offense at, 
and do not even look at the works of virtue by which they 
would like to be edified. | do not dignify them with a word 
or a look, for they will constantly find something to 
slander. You are well and pray to God for me. March 5,

To Joseph Levin Metzsch in Mila. 


This letter, which is included in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, 
1814, does not belong to the year 1520, as we see from the 
Erlanger Briefwechsel, vol. VII, p. 249, but to the year 1530. We 
have placed it, just as the earlier editions, sub. No. 273 also in the 
year 1520. In the Zwickau Rathsschulbibliothek there is a copy of 
Stephan Roth, which is undoubtedly made after the original, with 
the year Anno XXX, which will be correct, because Roth was in 
the closest contact with Metzsch. Metzsch studied in Leipzig in 
1522. The debts seem to have weighed heavily on him, so that 
he once seriously thought of selling his Mila estate. Perhaps the 
strong child blessing - until 1546 there are 3 sons, 3 daughters, 
three times twins and another son born - contributed to his 
indebtedness.

Preface [Luther's]. 

Luther had several letters of distress (as he calls 
them) sent out to the Margrave, Elector of Brandenburg 
2c., and to the same country's commoners and estates, 
as well as to Katherina Hornung's, to admonish them all 
to join the shameful, blasphemous cause, which stinks 
through the whole empire and gives great annoyance to 
all the world. To such letters, she alone answers Wolff 
Hornung, and defends both herself and the Elector, 
speaking to him at the end: "This is what | have told you 
in response to your cry.

and do not want to restrain Luther's chatter." Because it 
should be answered to such public letters, it would be a 
pity that [it] should not go out publicly, so that everyone 
would know what Luther's answer to his letters had been. 
And it is truly a very feminine thing that it is not easy 
to grasp who is the master over such a woman, unless 
one has gloves on of deer skins lined with misery skin, 1) 
as everyone can well notice. Her name is Mrs. Katherina 
Blanckenfelt, and yet Luther had written to Katherina 
Hornung. But perhaps the saying Mosi, Genes. 2, 24: 
"The two are one body"; 2) although Moses strictly 
forbade [Deut. 22, 5] that a man should not wear female 
clothing. And God will protect each one's own from this 
woman Katherina Blanckefelden,® unless a good healer 
would have come upon her with a sharp pinch, and would 
have made a borgel*) out of it, so that she would not have 
to make a vain Katherin Blanckefeldin out of it. What a 
shameful, impudent thing it is about whores and boys. 


Follow the letter from word to word: 


Wolf Hornung ! ® | have received your letter together 
with an enclosed copy of some alleged writings,” which 
your god and councilor, Luther, is supposed to have done 
and sent out to my lord, the prince and sovereign, also to 
the three bishops, counts, lords and knighthood of this 
electorate of the Mark of Brandenburg, which |, having 
found little truth® in it, neither allow myself to be mistaken 
nor to dispute. 


a) Dear, speak: Good morning, Wolff Hornung! 

b) Devil! She is truly angry, and talks to her husband 
as a great prince and lord. 

c) "little truth". So | can hear that nevertheless not 
everything is a lie. We thank such report and confession. 


1) Such gloves were worn by princes and great lords; neither 
blow nor thrust passed through. 

2) This goes to the Elector Joachim and Catharina Hornung, 
behind whom the latter hides in this letter. From this also the 
following becomes understandable. 

3) That is, before the Elector Joachim, who hides under the 
woman's skirt. 

4) Borg == a castrated pig. 





For | have no doubt that the common and noble estates 
of these lands will not allow themselves to be moved by 
uch a man's loose, open, unsealed, untrue fiction and 
aps, first of all against their most gracious prince and 
overeign, and likewise against me, to do anything 
ispleasing, ungracious or repugnant. ® But here you see 
ow much Satan would like to blow fire out of his envious 
outh, if only it would ignite or stick. ° And Luther should 
ruly not worry so hard, but should rather reflect to himself 
ow good marriage and faith he kept to his lost nun, when 
e walks along the gaff at night with the lute’ . But so that 
do not forget my need for you, | do not want to tell you 
hat | have not confessed to Luther or to you of your 
nknowable and fictitious statements, nor, if God wills, 
hall | be proven with truth and reason. 9) For the fact that 
am held against you by force, or protected for injustice, 
ou do first of all, together with your followers, to my most 
racious lord, the prince and sovereign, and likewise to 
e, unkindly, violence and injustice. For your tyrannical, 
urderous evil deed, which you perpetrated on me while 
was sitting by your side and at your table, without cause 
nd in a dishonorable manner," is unlawful to the city and 
he country, and must also be executed and proven with 
a living document in case of necessity. So | can still show 
it with the sign on my body,’ so | have from you; so you 
can also deny or contradict it with no truth or reason. The 
sworn, prescribed and sealed receipt is yours, 


d) It may also truly good, strong hope, because it is 
probably such an evil thing. 

e) Yes, are you here troffen, you noble blood? In 
aeternum, Domine, whores and knaves never part. 

f) Here | want to swear on Katerninus 6) and Katerina's 
chastity that it was not a lute but a bagpipe. 

g) There would be two or three whore children from 
your whore host. 

h) Behold, Hornung, rub against me more, if thou wilt 
see Rome! 

i) And with the landmark, 7) which dll have from your 
little dream, you can probably prove more, what he and 
you are. 


5) schleuplich == slippery, insidious, insidious. 
6) This is the Elector of Brandenburg. 
7) namely the child she had from the Elector.

which you have, without all compulsion and urgency, 
confirmed, sealed, and also fastened with a physical 
oath” (to which you have never urged or induced 
either with tower or stick or some imprisonment or 
punishment of severity 1) ), unpleasant or 
burdensome, so | have nevertheless, | have, as far as 
the marriage and the divorce are concerned, always 
offered myself to due and proper right, that | hereby, if 
you do not want to remit me ever speech, offer myself 
again on my proper judge and my ordinarium,) not to 
be before you right and fairness of the place. But as 
far as the goods are concerned, which you handed 
over to me according to the sworn contract, you know 
to remember that you did not bring me more than one 
and a half hundred florins against my contribution, 
which extends to a thousand florins. Now you bought 
the house in which | still live for three hundred florins, 
paid one hundred florins on it alone, and left me with 
a debt of two hundred florins to pay on the house. 
Item, with my most gracious lord, the Elector, three 
hundred florins of borrowed money, item, with Claus 
Fugen one and a half hundred florins, which debt | 
have then paid and laid aside in your absence, praise 
God! from mine,” and not from yours. Now make a 
calculation of what | may owe you of this, if it should 
come to a division. Therefore, it would be 
unnecessary for you to complain so highly that your 
great property is held up to you, for from this you have 
to judge how much you should be entitled to if it is to 
come about right away. But so that | am not lacking 
again for the sake of the piece, an honorable councilor 
here in Cologne on the Spree, where | am possessed, 
shall be my rightful and powerful in all equity.” 


k) Oh, on my holy cross! she means the contract, 
sealed with the sausage. 

|) Well, my dear, if you are torn, then the devil will lapp 
you! 

m) Dear, but did you pay it from yours, from which 
yours? since you sit on? 2) or on which you live? If it is to 
be divided, then half of it must go to Hornung and the 
other half to your Trautlein, and perhaps that would be 
right. 

n) | hear nothing unequal nor unreasonable, except 
that the above division shall proceed equitably. 


1) That is, by threatening torture. 
2) These words are to be taken literally. 


| also want to be hopeful and undoubtedly confident, 
if you want to take me to the end of one with justice, 
and my most gracious lord, the Elector, will ask for 
such justification for escort, it will not be denied to 
you. But that | should turn to you again with my body 
or person, that | cannot bring myself to do,° for that | 
once encountered from you, | would also have to 
worry about from you further. But for an amicable 
agreement, so that | would be separated from you, | 
have often offered to come to you in and outside of 
the country,°) as namely to Jtiterbach, Baruch and 
many other places, but that you wanted to provide me 
with a princely escort to Saxony. For this purpose, | 
have twice sent you the sealed escort of my most 
gracious lord, the Elector of Brandenburg, so that you 
would never lack safe access to me, but it has 
always been you and not me who was lacking. From 
this it appears publicly, with what reason and truth 
that you are shouting me out together with your 
followers so publicly and yet blamelessly” and 
educating the people, and also with what evidence it 
is imposed on my most gracious lord, the Elector, that 
| should be protected and handled in my will of 
courage or against fairness, since | can tolerate and 
suffer justice’) and fairness and have never refused it. 
And to top it off, and over and above my previous 
ordinary legal submission, | am once again inclined to 
accept and wait for an amicable day and trade with 
you at an appropriate place of this Electorate border, 
as Mittewald, Potsdam, Brietzen, Trebbin, Sarmund, 
Képenick," which places are located to you, and if you 
would also ascribe daytime, | offer to you once again 
of my most gracious lord, the Elector 2c., certainly 


0) | believe that, on my oath, because you have 
something greater to bring over your heart, for which you 
would need such an amicable agreement. 

p) Thus a wife shall write to her husband, for good 
example and honor to all wives. 

q) Believe the devil with your skillful escort in my 
place! 

r) Truly, quite innocent! how manly conscious.

have to watch whores and boys; if it were still so good for 
him!

of writing, because the Elector, as a result of the news received 
from Insbruck by Hans von Dolzig (Férstemann, Urkundenbuch, 
p. 177) of May 8, which included a ban on preaching 










Whether Imperial Maj. Maj. would ask or command 
hat my most gracious lord should allow fish and not meat 
0 be eaten on Fridays and Saturdays, 

it happens, 

My most gracious lord may again ask that His Imperial 
Majesty will spare His Lordship. Maj. will spare his Lord's 
Grace with this. But if a serious commandment is to 
ollow, my lord may well do so. Lord may well do so, at 
he service of His Imperial Majesty. Maj.'s service, but 
ith notice that it is not for conscience' sake, but for His 
Imperial Majesty's love and obedience. Maj. for love and 
obedience. For hitherto my most gracious lord, in other 
imperial assemblies, with the same, and not with imperial 
maj. Maj. as sovereign, nor has any seal or letter then 
lbeen presented as an imperial order. Maj. command, as 
now would be present and command. 

On the other hand, whether Imperial Maj. Maj. would 
request or command that his Lordship not allow 
preaching, his Lordship cannot grant this, but shall be 
free to allow his Lordship to preach, for St. Paul says: 
God's word shall be unbound; yet up to now every prince 
has been allowed to hold masses and preach his chaplain 
in his court and camp. However, it is not in his power to 
close the house or to forbid other people to come to it, 
because he is not the master of the people of Augsburg. 

Thirdly, whether Imperial Maj. Maj. would ask or 
command that His Imperial Grace should go to mass with 
him: here | fear, because the devotees at Augsburg have 
now trampled the Sacrament underfoot and reviled it to 
the highest degree with a shameful chant, 2c. that His 
Imperial Grace would do well if she at least went to church 
with them once for nieste, but that the boys who 
desecrate the Sacrament should not go to mass with 
them, 


On May 11, he again requested Luther's advice in this matter, and 
in his letter he refers to a previous concern of Luther's, namely 
probably to our document. Therefore, Fdérstemann's time 
determination: "approximately in the middle of the month of May", 
will be too late, but even more so Schirrmacher's: "after June 16", 
since the preaching ban really took place on June 18 (see St. 
Louis Edition, Vol. XVI, 749, No. 944). However, the fact that such 
a concern about the three points was demanded so early, in 
March or April, can be explained by the fact that these were taken 
over as open questions from the Imperial Diet at Speier in 1529. 


1428 


may not boast that his Lordships keep it with them. So it 
does not harm the conscience, because his Lordship 
does not keep such a mass as a sacrifice (although who 
knows whether the priest himself would make a sacrifice 
out of it, who keeps such masses? They are probably so 
crude and wild), but rather, as a servant to his master of 
the house, the Imperial Majesty serves and does his will. 
But the annoyance that one might take from this is less 
than the improvement that the enthusiasts might take by 
avoiding such masses. Thus we have here a mighty 
example of the Scripture, 2 Kings 5:18 f., that Elisha the 
prophet permits the prince Naaman of Syria to go with 
his lord king to his idol's temple and to be with him. And 
if they are angry, it will be found in other things, in which 
his lord will hold differently than all of them; the deed will 
prove it, and is fed with obedience and willing humility 
with good grace to the false mouths.

To Georg Wicel and Anton Hermann in Belzig. 


Wicel, born in 1503 at Bach, preacher at Niemeck, had taken 
in Joh. Campanus from Malseick in the diocese of Liege, who 
studied in Wittenberg and denied the Trinity, and was therefore, 
as well as Campanus himself, imprisoned along with Hermann. 
Campanus was subsequently released, under the condition that 
he leave the country. Wicel and Hermann also gained their 
freedom through Luther's use. Wicel remained in Niemeck until 
the summer of 1531; then he left it under a pretext and returned 
to the papacy. Nothing further is known about Hermann.

Grace and peace! Our Ziringius 3) will tell you more 
about the Emperor's affairs, for it is a long story. It is true 
that he has decided to come to Germany, and he will 
come shortly, as everyone believes, full of wrath against 
us, unless the Turk makes peace, as he did at Vienna, 
where he induced the most arrogant dukes of Bavaria to 
write most humbly to the heretical princes for help. It is 
said that the Turk is in Hungary and has decided to return 
at the beginning of spring. One of the envoys sent by our 
princes to the emperor and captured or detained by him 
has been with us.

his side, the Pope kissed the Emperor often on the 
cheek, until all his great ones had kissed him in the same 
way, and it was reported that gold was scattered among 
the people, 4000 ducats. Carl gave the pope 4000 gold 
medals in a gold purse, 5) that is, gold coins embossed 
with his and his brother's image, which we usually call 
"gift coins or honor coins". May the canons rejoice and 
triumph, so that they may quickly perish, amen. For the 
world must rejoice and the apostles be sad, but this joy 
will find its due end. Let us only pray, and the gates of 
hell will not be able to do anything. Fare well in the Lord.

4) Namely Michael von Kaden. (See St. Louis Edition, Vol. 
XVI, No. 849 ff.) In a letter of April 7, the Elector had asked the 
Nuremberg Council to let Luther and his famulus Veit Dietrich 
‘live in Nuremberg during the Reichstag, because he wanted to 
have him near him. The council refused because Luther was still 
in the Reichsacht after the Worms Edict, but did not want to give 
the negative answer by letter, but sent Kaden to the Elector to 
communicate this orally. Kaden arrived in Coburg on Easter 
evening, April 16. (So Kolde in the Kirchengeschichtl. Studien; 
Luther writes to Hansmann; April 17, St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. XVI, 
667.) From the time of his presence, the date of the letter can be 
determined with certainty. Férstemann's Conjectur: Altera 
Paschatis (April 18) will be correct (Férstemann, Urkundenbuch, 
vol. I, p. 147, note 3). 

5) We assume with the Erlangen correspondence instead of 
medanos the conjecture medallos, think coins. 

6) This is, as already said, Foérstemann's Conjectur instead: 
Altera Novembris. - Because of the fuit apud os 
April 18 is more likely than April 17.

true character of our writing. Although we are not dealing with a 
letter here, we did not want to withhold from the buyers and 
readers of our edition this most interesting document, to which we 
already drew attention in the 16th volume, Col. 985 in the note, 
and think that we can communicate it most easily here. Our time 
determination is based on the following. On April 23, Luther 
arrived at the fortress of Coburg. The first larger writing, which he 
took there before the hand, was his "admonition to the clergy" 2c. 
On April 29, he wrote to Melanchthon (St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 
2310): "My admonition to the clergy is advancing; both the 
material and the impetuosity of the attack are growing under my 
hands, so that | am compelled to drive back, almost by force, a 
great many lansquenets 2) who do not cease to advance 
uninvited." We have no doubt that in our draft we encounter not a 
few "Landsknechte" whom Luther drove back, and who are no 
longer found in the Scriptures themselves at the corresponding 
place (St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. XVI, 985 ff.). Our determination of 
the time will therefore be, at least approximately, correct. We have 
already communicated the locations at the place just indicated 
completely in the note there. Bretschneider, Corp. Ref., Vol. IV, 
973 f., assumes that Jonas is the author of this draft; Seidemann, 
"Lauterbach", p. 103, Note, agrees with him. 


In the Church of Christ, one demands these rewritten 
pieces: 

First, a righteous preaching ministry, where the holy 
divine word is diligently and faithfully preached and taught 
according to pure Christian understanding, without the 
addition of any false teaching. 

In such a sermon it is clearly, actually and correctly 
taught and presented what is Christ and the gospel, 
righteous repentance and fear of God, how to obtain 
forgiveness of sin, of the ability and power of the keys of 
the church. 

This doctrine and the whole summa of the gospel is 
practiced in this church of Christ with diligent true 
adherence daily and without ceasing, both in the 
congregation and in each Christian for himself, by 
preaching, reading, comforting and exhorting, by 
expounding the Psalms and all kinds of books of 
Scripture, as Paul writes in 1 Cor. 14. 

There we are taught about Christian freedom, how 
consciences are free in Christ. 

And to obtain such teaching is had with great 
seriousness and utmost diligence respect that

Gratias, and narration of some sayings before the 
parents’ table. Item, in the morning, when the children get

righteous earnest prayer, both publicly and secretly. 

Christian litanies and prayers for all kinds of conditions| 
and needs. 

Righteous ban, that is, that some are not allowed to,

In the Church of Christ, the righteous are learned 
bishops and preachers, mighty of the Scriptures, and, as 
Paul says [Titus 1:9, 11], equipped and skillful to teach, to 
comfort, and to shut the mouths of the adversaries. 
Righteous diaconi who take care of the poor.

at the hour of death for the dying. 

Rightly, clearly, certainly founded instruction from the 
Scriptures, which estates or lives are divine: from 
authorities and their office; from parents; what there befits 
to keep sons, daughters, servants, maids, lords, subjects, 
husbands, all kinds of offices and estates, so that they 
may lead their estate and life blessedly, chastely 3) and 
divinely. 

There are also orderly, proper, outward ceremonies 
and services, right fasting, honest clothing, free use of 
food, honest churches and places where the Word of God 
is preached. There are also proper external ceremonies 
and services, proper fasting, proper dress, free use of 
food, proper churches and places where God's word is 
preached. And this old with right instruction of Christian 
liberty, and how one may divinely use the outward 
services. 

The present bishops ask little or not at all about these 
highly necessary things, in which alone lies all power, and 
without which no Christian church can be. And it is to be 
pitied and eternally lamented that they do not care at all 
about such great things, which are proper for right bishops 
to know, do not think about them or know about them, nor 
do they want to be instructed or taught about them. 


In the church of the pope you can find these pieces:

fasting for three days.

true gospel and the old true doctrine, so Christ himself 
[and] the apostles preached and wrote, to be a novelty 
and heresy! The abuse of the holy blood is still reported 
today in Brunswick, where in the monastery of St. Egidii 
the sanctuary is praised as if it were the blood that Christ 
shed on Mount Calvary, for which reason indulgences 
are also given out in particular, and special seals are 
made, on which this title is: The Seal of the Blood of 
Christ.

without children the priests with their cooks were but of a

Grace and the peace of God in Christ! Although all 
these friends, Philip and the others with whom | am 
now dealing, are very great and very pleasant people, 
and one cannot wish for more pleasant or more 
sincere people than these, and we are also dealing 
with a large number of great people here, | still do not 
know, dearest father, since you are absent, what kind 
of image of being orphaned and alone seems to float 
before my eyes. That is what | wish above all things, 
and we all wish that we will see you again as soon as 
possible, safe and sound and happy, God grant it! 

We finally arrived in Augsburg with the most 
illustrious prince on Monday after Misericordias 
Domini [May 2]. The prince entered in churfuirstlichem 
decoration, and some ceremonies and pomp were 
used after the manner of the ancestors, with Joachim 
Pappenheim carrying the silver sword in front. You 
know the rest of the kind. 

The emperor's arrival has so far been uncertain, as 
it was when we were together, even among those 
who alone seemed to know about it and are quite 
reliable. A young man, M. von Hutten, has been sent 
from our trousers, 2) a very fast and almost winged 
horseman, and a very skillful scout of these things. 
He has reported that the Emperor has departed from 
Trent and will hold a Diet of the cities and nobility in 
the Austrian region at Hall or Insbruck; however, he 
will hasten his arrival because of many important 
causes that incite him both privately and in family 
matters. 

What the Count of Nassau, to whom the doors are 
always open not only to the Emperor's chamber but 
also to his ears and heart, has written to our Prince, 
and of other things belonging to this whole matter of 
religion and the public affairs of Germany, you will 
learn by the letter of Philip 3). There is nothing more 
gracious and kind than the piece which is in the 
tender (diplomate) or citation of the Kai-.

sers 4) in which he promises that he will not only 
recognize the matter but also seek ways of harmony 
with the utmost diligence. The rumor has not reported 
anything 5) contrary to this. Everyone says that the 
emperor will listen to both sides graciously and will 
not do anything tyrannical. What is left but to ask the 
Lord that, as in the past, so also in the future, the Lord 
himself may form the hearts of the kings and the 
emperor in his hand in such great matters and rule as 
a faithful builder. 

Our prince is the first of all at the Diet, to the 
amazement of many, to the astonishment of all. | don't 
know what the papists had said, as if the prince 
feared very much for himself and began to distrust the 
matter. But now, thank God, they see this fear. Let 
Jesus Christ strengthen him and us. That haste 
seemed to many, as well as to us, not to be wisely 
undertaken, but God directs these things wonderfully. 
Every day we learn that this hastening brings 
significant fruit. Of course, there is a great shortage 
of grain here, and a roll that one buys for a heller in 
Wittenberg is hardly bought for a penny here. The 
same is true of other things. But the loss in costs will 
be compensated by God's grace elsewhere. The 
other princes are on their way. Duke George, about 
which we have a certain report, has passed through 
Nuremberg and will come here tomorrow: The Prince 
of Hesse is on his way, as Schnepf has told us. The 
Electors who live on the Rhine are all expected by the 
coming week. Therefore, as | hope, and as the 
Wittenberg Church has requested, the Diet will have 
its progress; may the Lord grant that everything be 
ordered and arranged for the glory of his holy name. 

As far as my private affairs are concerned, by 
God's grace | received the next day, after the Prince 
entered Augsburg [May 3], the most desired and 
joyful news, which pleased me, God _ knows! 
extraordinarily, by bringing me the good news that the 
fifth son had been born to me. [In passing: so that you 
would not have written in vain: These walls which

But | send here to you for your practice a certain song. 
For since | could neither read nor write for four days, | 
happened to find a paper in the secret room on which this 
old chant was set for three voices, which | have cleaned, 
corrected and improved, and added the fourth voice, and 
composed a text for it from the chorus: namely, with this 
suggestion, | would like to deceive our Capellan, M. 
Georg, 2) that he would receive this chant, sent to me by 
you, aS a new one published in Augsburg from the 
Cantorei for the arrival of the Emperor and Ferdinand. But 
it is hoped that he could be deceived if you will praise it 
to me a little, especially that you have heard that the 
simplicity in it pleases many, and that you will send the 
rest of the text. If you are willing to live to please me, then 
| will send him all of this, and if the matter succeeds, that 
| will have deceived this Bavarian 3) critic and untimely 
reprover (Vomum) of music, then | will have forever 
taken away from him the power to judge the music in 
which he is not a little pleased. Perhaps we will also 
chase away some sirens from here. 4) Therefore, do your 
duty here and attend to this matter diligently. More

Grace and peace in the Holy Spirit, who is higher than 
all reason, grant you Christ, my dear Jonas. | am a 
burdensome and unsuitable comforter, which comes 
from the fact that | am also not at all rich in spring 
thoughts and flowery heart movements, as | would like 
and would be necessary for you. | am also often scorched 
by the wind and the heat, so that | am like this arid and 
thirsty region of ours. But see that you are strong in 
Christ, whose work and art, yes, whose whole kingdom 
is that in our weakness strength and victory may come 
forth. The wicked are joyful, they are secure, they also 
utter threats and seek bloodshed; meanwhile we must 
suffer and grieve. All this must be done so that the 
Scripture may also be fulfilled in our bodies; if it is not 
fulfilled, we cannot be well, but if it is fulfilled, we shall 
live. You do not suffer alone, but have comrades who 
also groan, almost wearied by suffering; we are 
esteemed like sheep for the slaughter [Rom. 8, 10]. "Is it 
but vain suffering, one upon another?" because he who 
hates and persecutes us neither tires nor sleeps. Then 
you have many and exceedingly great gifts to oppose this 
One Evil, if you will but consider it. Among these is that 
of which the Scripture boasts, saying that it is something 
very great [Sir. 26, 19. f.]: "There is nothing dearer on 
earth than a chaste woman, and there is nothing more 
delicious than a chaste woman," and [Proverbs 31, 10.]: 
"To whom a virtuous woman is given, she is far more 
noble than the most precious pearls." 2c. Nor do you 
want to be completely in lust, according to the example 
of the feast [Luc. 16:19], and not be like the brothers of 
Christ in any way, who through many tribulations have 
reached the kingdom of God with 





You will be taken by force [Apost. 14,22. and Matth. 
11,12]. Therefore | pray thee that thou bear this 
chastening of the Father wisely. For there is a time to be 
happy, and there is a time to be sad; we gladly accept the 
former, but we must not reject the latter either. The Lord 
Jesus, who has taken your son to Himself and will take 
better care of him than you, comfort and strengthen you, 
amen. From the kingdom of the jackdaws. May 19, 1530.

Urban Rhegius, preacher in Augsburg, to Luther.

Rhegius expresses his joy at the personal meeting with 
Melanchthon, Jonas, Agricola and Spalatin. He was invited to the 
table by the Landgrave of Heffen and discussed the whole matter 
of the Gospel with him, who was well versed in the Holy 
Scriptures, and then two hours more about the doctrine of the 
Lord's Supper. The prince had all the arguments of the 
Sacramentarians at hand and wanted to hear their refutation from 
Rhegius. In the process, he had come to the conclusion that the 
prince did not hold with Zwingli, but only had a heartfelt desire for 
harmony.

extremely dear father, Hans Luther the Elder, has 
passed away from this life, just -on Sunday Exaudi [May 
29] at one o'clock. This death has truly put me into 
mourning, which | remember not only for nature, but also 
for the exceedingly kind love, because through him my 
Creator has given me all that | am and have; and 
although | am comforted by the fact that he writes that he 
has gently fallen asleep strong in the faith of Christ, the 
lamentation and the memory of the exceedingly sweet 
contact with him has shaken my innermost being, so that 
| have hardly ever despised death so much. But "the 
righteous are snatched away from calamity and enter 
into rest" [Isa. 57:1. f.], namely, so often do we die before 
we die ONCE. | now enter into the inheritance of the 
name that | am almost the oldest Luther in my family. | 
am now also entitled not only to the approximation, but 
also to the right to follow him through death into the 
kingdom of Christ, which he graciously bestows upon us 
all, for whose sake we are the most miserable of all men 
and the reproach of the whole world. Therefore, since | 
am all too afflicted, | do not write more expansively now, 
because it is fair and godly that |, as a son, should entrust 
such a father, from whom the Father of mercies has 
received me and by whose sweat | have been nourished 
and formed, as | am. Indeed, | rejoice that he lived until 
these times, that he could see the light of truth. Praise be 
to God in all that he does.

No. 1567. 


Coburg Fortress. June 5, 1530. 


To the abbot Friedrich Pistorius in Nuremberg. 


Luther gives thanks for a gift and gives his opinion that the 
oath of a papal abbot is void.

To the in Christ highly venerable Mr. Friedrich, head 
of the Aegidien monastery in Nuremberg, his 
superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord! | have received 
the sword you sent, dear man, although it was not 
necessary to deprive you of it. Poor me, | have nothing 
to give but my empty letter. 

About the oath, about which you, worthy lord, desire 
[my opinion], this is my opinion, that it is first of all 
devoured by itself by saying that it happened to the 
bishops who enter [into their office] in a lawful way. But 
where are such bishops nowadays, who enter in a 
canonical way, and do not rather buy from Rome by 
simony, then enter elsewhere as thieves and robbers, so 
that they slaughter and perish? Since they are not 
bishops, nor do they want to be bishops according to 
Christ, they could not demand such an oath, nor could 
anyone take it, and it is completely null and void and 
must be annulled until he [the bishop] enters in a 
canonical way, and does what the Holy Spirit commands 
a bishop to do Tit. 2 and 1 Tim. 2. And so it [the oath] is 
null and void as far as the person of the one who 
demands it is concerned. Then, even if the person were 
fit, as even the tyrant must keep that which has been 
sworn, yet the thing itself which is sworn cannot be 
performed without dishonor to the name of GOD by 
which it is sworn. For he requires that Christ be denied, 
and that

the bundle of letters to you on the journey, or he is an 
impostor and a very great scoundrel. 2) For since you 
complain about our silence in the letter [No. 1566] that 
he brought [to us] 3) and demand from us the duty [of 
writing] that we have written so abundantly through 
the same messenger, we can assume nothing else 
than that our letters have not reached you at all, be it 
that this has happened through some [coincidence] 
and little finger of Satan or through the malice or 
disloyalty of the messenger. We at least gave this one 
a large bundle, we wrote the name Coburg on it, [also] 
4) the name of the captain; 5) we also dropped 
(communicavimus) something of a [secret, and] 6) 
added: of the prince and even of the [pope], so that 
the letters would be delivered faithfully. But now we 
are all angry that they have not been delivered, and 
we are almost bursting with anger. But this does not 
only annoy us for your sake. 


1) This answer will be No. 1559. It can be inferred from this 
that Jonas did not receive Luther's letter of May 19, No. 1554. 

2) In any case, the messenger was innocent, because as we 
see from Luther's letter to Jakob Probst of June 1, Luther received) 
Melanchthon's letter of May 22.

the Lutheran princes may go with the Emperor in the

the Emperor as well as that of Ferdinand, many 10) 
Spaniards on horses, on mules, in carriages have 
already arrived as forerunners, and already that 
brother of Ehinger 11) has arrived, who, as it was said, 
has received a new island as a gift. The latter 
celebrated his wedding here, and it is said that now, 
after so many forerunners, the emperor will certainly 
be there. The chief chancellor, Mr. Mercurinus, who 
recently became a cardinal, and who was said to be 
of all people at the emperor's court the most 
approvingly opposed to the Lutheran doctrine, and 
who with a sincere mind sought ways to give peace to 
Germany, died, if | am not mistaken, on the Saturday 
before Pentecost. There is some news of this here, 
and it is not doubtful. It is said that he was very old, 
quite at the end of his life; he had passed his 77th 
year. The death was not untimely, but nevertheless, | 
do not know by what miraculous fate, sudden. Since 
the emperor was about to leave for the Imperial Diet 
in Insbruck, Mercurinus, having already packed and 
arranged his belongings, had also left. 


7) We agree with Kawerau that after solitudo no gap is to be 
assumed. The Erl. Briefw. would like to add tua. 

8) This much seems to be clear from this letter, however, that 
the Augsburgs did not write from May 22 to June 12, i.e. a full 
three weeks, despite Melanchthon's assurances in the letter of 
June 25 that he had written every week.

He had come down from his room, had said goodbye 
to the landlord, and (it is wonderful to hear) as he was 
about to mount the horse or the carriage, he suddenly 
felt a kind of faintness and | don't know what kind of 
pain all over his body, but the man's voice did not 
immediately fail him, but he said: | feel that | don't 
know what kind of dwindling of all strength is coming 
over me, and so he fell to the ground dead. This has 
been attributed to Duke George, and our bridge has 
heard this from Doctor Pistor, George's chancellor. 
Some think that the man, exhausted by the 
exceedingly great and prolonged labors at court, and 
broken by the worries and cares of the very great 
affairs, thus died, since old age now fell heavily upon 
him, from the stroke, or also from old age itself, which 
in itself is a disease; others think, because he seemed 
to give a little too healthy and fair counsel in regard to 
this matter of religion, that he had been struck by a 
Guelph weapon, or had drunk a Venetian soup. 
However it may be, it is a sign from God that is not 
very good that such a great man dies just at the 
beginning of the Diet and on the journey to it. 
Moreover, the Count of Salm, that highly famous 
count who handed over the King of France, who had 
been captured in battle, to the Emperor as a defeated 
man and prisoner, has recently passed away; he has 
also departed in these days. Behold, my dear father, 
the highest man in the council and then the greatest 
leader in warlike affairs are taken away almost at the 
same time. What those may think whom God warns 
by such examples, | do not know. | certainly wish that 
both of them were alive, for | hear that they were good 
men and lights of the court. Also the confessor of the 
emperor, who also shortly before had received the 
badge of honor of the Cardinal's hat 1), is also said to 
be dead. But it is said that he died out of pure carnal 
sadness, because the emperor, after he had received 
the cardinal dignity, excluded him from his closer 
contact and did not want to have such a great 
gentleman as a confessor. 

But so that | may also write something to you about 
the condition of this city, whose appearance is truly 
very miserable and lamentable, perhaps it would be 
useful to first touch on something about our 
preachers. M. Agricola of Eisleben, the preacher of 
our court, has, from the 


1) Kolde has put a question mark on Galeri. 





In his sermon, he dealt with several main articles of 
Christian doctrine: of faith, of works, of the 
sacraments, and under these articles he preached for 
four days against the error of the sacramentarians. 
There he touched a wasps' nest, and the crowd takes 
it with the utmost displeasure that in this city the 
Zwinglian doctrine is condemned or even lightly 
hyped. The Prince of Hesse has not yet been to our 
sermons, not even with our Prince. He raised that 
well-known dispute with Eisleben 2) by claiming that 
Eisleben had publicly sinned, | don't know what, 
against Christian love, therefore it was not possible 
that he could edify 2c. But you know that another 
cause could be behind it; about that verbally, if 
something else is not objected to in the meantime. 
The Margrave, 3) Duke Ernst of Lineburg, the Prince 
of Anhalt and several others attend our sermons. The 
preacher of the Prince of Hesse, Schnepf, has so far 
preached in another church, St. Ulrich's, before a very 
large audience and with the whole city in attendance, 
also before a larger crowd than ours, and taught 
exceedingly loudly. But today, on Trinity Day, he 
began to touch on the article of the Sacrament, and 
said: he did not hate the persons, Zwingli rc.” or 
others, but this whole doctrine was [ungodly]. 5) Then 
the crowd suddenly began to get excited and to hiss 
and murmur with each other, then they began to go 
straight away from the church and to give obvious 
signs of an offended mind and their excitement. But 
Schnepf remained firm as he had begun, [and with] 
great strength of body and spirit he brought [the 
sermon] to an end. About the Prince of Hesse another 
time orally. At another time [more]. Augsburg is 
completely devoted to a certain Michael 6) and it 
swears by his words. He was in Wittenberg for a while 
and went out from us, but he was not of us [1 John 
2:19]: an un

loquacity. In front of him, Urban Rhegius, Doctor 
Frosch and Doctor Stephan stink here in the large

should know, 3) my [dear father, that we are] 
otherwise quite well through the Lord; in particular, 
that the troubles in this common matter, as is [his 
nature,] plague the Lord Philip quite well. He admits 
that these exceedingly great things have now come to 
depend on no human counsel, but nevertheless he 
would gladly be present at the deliberations in heaven 
(as we are all minded) and would gladly give counsel 
to God, if He would (as you are wont to speak) admit 
us as counselors. | would have you write to him very 
often for our mutual comfort, yours and ours. We pray,

Augsburg. June 13, 1530. 


Justus Jonas to Luther. 


Jonas reports that 500 copies of Luther's "Admonition to the 
Clergy" have already been sold in Augsburg, even to opponents 
who had expected a retraction. About a statement by Fabian voll 
Feilitzsch. Of the great impression made by that writing, which is 
only reviled by the sacramentarians. Of a joke that a citizen of 
Augsburg made with Faber, and of a conversation Melanchthon 
had with Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, who had spoken 
approvingly about various demands of the Protestants. Finally, he 
expresses his condolences over the death of Luther's father.

We cannot yet be sure of anything, given the great 
variability and diversity of the expressions of the will. 
Nevertheless, they are good signs. Let us continue to 
cast our concern on the Lord in prayer. 

D. Cochlaus was at dinner with us yesterday, and 
he now speaks more calmly of both forms and the 
articles than ever before. But during the meal we 
answered quite freely to some harsh and poisonous 
speeches.

worthy old man, through your letter 1); | was greatly 
saddened by this news for your sake, but 
nevertheless, since the worthy old man_ has 
undoubtedly fallen asleep in Christ at a great age, we 
must give thanks to God that he has lived so long and 
has departed from this life in the confession of the 
Gospel, now that the Gospel of Christ has been 
spread through you, his son, and this Christ has been 
known. 

Greet, | beg you, in your letter in my name your 
wife, "Muhme Lenen", your son Johannes and your 
little daughter Magdalena. Given at Augsburg, in 
haste, on the day after Trinity [June 13] in the year 2c.

Melanchthon to Luther. 


Melanchthon gives as the reason for his silence that he had 
waited for the fulfillment of his request that Luther write to the 
landgrave to admonish him from an alliance with the Zwinglians, 
who reproached him for overrunning the papists with war. About 
the behavior of the papists. About the Emperor's request to the 
Elector of Saxony to come to him, and about the Emperor's 
imminent arrival. About Erasmus' illness and his own worries. 


A copy is found in Paris in the biblioth. teempli St. Genovevae, 
Cod. D, 54° . Printed in Corp. Ref., vol. IV, 1008 and in Erl. 
Briefw., vol. VII, p. 383. 


1) The letter to Melanchthon of June 5 will be meant. 

2) In the copy, the letter is undated. The date, however, is 
certain from the previous letter, because there as well as here it 
is reported that Melanchthon had talked with Duke Heinrich of 
Brunswick today. 





Hail! The waiting for your letter to the landgrave 

has tormented me so much that | could not write 
anything in the meantime. 3) | asked you to write a 
letter to him so that he would not plunge into the 
ungodly cause of the Zwinglish-minded (xxx 
XXXXXXXXXXXX). 
For he is extremely at odds with everyone over this 
matter. Today, Henry of Brunswick has complained to 
me very severely about the disputations of the 
landgrave in this matter, and asks that we make every 
effort that he not be separated from us. The 
Zwinglians are extraordinarily persecuting him. Here 
they publicly boast that they will attack the empire. 
Such a great rage has taken possession of their 
minds. And you are regarded by many as having 
prophesied in your booklet about the spirit of Miinzer. 
4) It is undoubtedly driving that party. Our adversaries 
triumph as if they had completely defeated us. We 
cannot yet guess anything about the emperor's will, at 
least he has not made anything known about it yet. 
He has absent-mindedly disputed with us _ by 
summoning our prince to him, but with this condition 
that he should not have an alliance. 5) | believe that 
he still suspects that there is an alliance with us. The 
emperor will be here within two days. Erasmus is 
dangerously ill and it is said that he is profoundly 
insane by some kind of madness. | am almost 
consumed by the most miserable worries. Therefore, 
you will ask Christ for us.

Augsburg. June 18, 1530. 


Justus Jonas to Luther. 


Detailed report on the emperor's entry into Augsburg and the 
negotiations with the princes that immediately followed. The 
emperor had brought fifteen doctors from Spain. After the death 
of Mercurinus, there was no hope for a union. The pope had 
promised money and warriors to suppress the Lutherans. 
Melanchthon was tormented by worries, 


3) On May 22, Melanchthon had made the urgent request that 
Luther write to the Landgrave (see St. Louis ed., vol. XVI, 689, s 
4). It was not until June 20 that Luther complied with this request, 
but sooner than this letter had reached his hands, for he did not 
receive it until June 21 or 22, and, being incensed at the long 
silence of his friends in Augsburg, at first did not want to read it 
at all (cf. Melanchthon's letter to Luther of June 26, St. Louiser 
Ausg., vol. XVI, 896, no. 975).

Stimnie (vivae vocis oraculo, as the jurists speak) that 
immediately the next day our preachers should desist 
[from preaching]. Something has been added of the 
procession of the feast of Corpus Christi 2c. Of these 
things, therefore, consultations are now taking place 
at court and with us, 1) and yet God would that you 
were with us; how we would like that, the Lord Philip 
and the rest of us, or that we had your counsel and 
opinion! But now this is over. The Prince did not go 
along in the Corpus Christi procession, nor the 
younger [Prince], nor Margrave George, nor the 
Hessian, nor Luneburg 2c. The emperor brought 15 
Spanish doctors, monks and others. Today Ziegler 
wrote from Ferrara to Philippus [about the same] 2). 
He writes that those Spaniards are ignorant of 
godliness and [of the Scriptures]. Cornelius 
Schopper,? whom you know, that eloquent man 
whom the expelled King of Denmark had with him at 
Wittenberg, has talked quite confidentially with Philip 
and with me about the common cause. He says that 
now that Mercurinus, the only author and mediator of 
peace, is dead, he despairs of [establishing] 
harmony, because the Welsh are pressing the 
emperor against the Lutherans with such impetuosity, 
and the pope promises troops of war, money, 
auxiliaries and assistance of every kind, and that for 
a long time, against the Lutherans. Although 
frightening rumors about the Turk have been spread 
by quite reliable people, in the meantime one keeps 
silent about it (dear God, what blindness Christ gives 
to His enemies!), and yet one sees that this is of all 
the greatest evil that Germany is facing. We are 
attacked here by Pharisaic certainty, by Pharisaic 
contempt, arrogance and hatred, and with quite 
satanic arts. The Lord Philip, as you know the man, 
is miserably tormented by the worries and cares of 
such a great cause, and we all also learn here in a 
good school what it is that the godly are full "of the

see daily, under so many threats and afflictions of the 
Pharisees, the fruit of the prayers of our Lutheran 
church and the power and effectiveness of the 
catechism and the children's litanies. You, my dear 
father, continue to pray as you do. The Lord has 
made us rich through you. We have the Psalms, we 
have Paul, of whom we now see that it is clear and 
revealed to us, although it is now closed and 
completely sealed to so many doctors and wise men 
and mighty men. 

Today, on Saturday, the Emperor, by a public 
proclamation made by four trumpeters and by the 
voice of the herald, 5) has ordered the cessation of all 
preaching on both sides throughout Augsburg, both 
ours and the papists, for a time, until the matter is 
recognized, and only the bare text of the Gospel is 
read before the Emperor and the princes. "This will 
make much gossip." But, my dear father, do not 
believe the rumors of the great crowd unless you see 
our letters. We will, God willing, hand over articles in 
the main next Tuesday [June 21] (as | hope), then 
they will see that we freely confess the Gospel of 
Christ. | would like you to write a letter of comfort to 
the prince soon. Farewell in Christ, my dearest father, 
and greet your wife and your little son and your 
daughter and "Mume Lene". Given in haste at 
Augsburg, on the Saturday after Trinity [June 18] in 
the year of the Lord 2c. | ask you, my dear father, to 
pray constantly for us. 

From the bottom of your heart, your J. Jonas. 

"The Bishop of Mainz is holding his own until now, 
as is Duke Henry of Brunswick. Things are on the 
right track." May the Lord have mercy. 

Greetings, | beg you, in my name to M. Veit. Mr. 
Spalatin sends you the history of the chanting at the 
emperor's entry. Philip and Mr. Agricola greet you. | 
would like you, my dear father, to send very frequent 
letters of comfort to Philip, but only in general, that he 
may be of good cheer, since the greatness of the 
matter is such that it must be governed not by human 
but by divine wisdom. Again, be well, my dearest 
father.

Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable, esteemed 
Doctor and dear good friend! That you and your dear 
Sophia are well, | am glad to hear from the bottom of my 
heart. | have no new newspaper to write to you, because 
our Junkern Schweigler in Augsburg do not write 
anything to me, which disturbs me not a little, and | know 
that your dear brother-in-law and my good friend, Mr. 
Nicolaus Amsdorf, should become extremely angry with 
them, if he knew that they had become such 
Schweigelinge, especially at this time; he should also 
become a judge over them. 

From hearsay | have heard that Venice has sent and 
given many hundreds of thousands of florins to the 
Emperor, and Florence has offered five tons of gold; but 
they will not accept them for the sake of the Pope, who 
has promised to give body and goods to the Emperor, 
likewise the French also at his par ma foi, as the Pope 
in nomine Domini, and is sanctissimum foedus, a 
delicious thing in cap: Non credimus. But | have heard 
from Doctor Martin Luther himself: If Venice, Pabst, and 
Francis become good emperors from the heart, and do 
not put all their money and goods into it (for there are 
three persons in one being, of an incomprehensible 
anger and hatred against Imperial Maj. Maj., with 
hypocrisy, lies and deceit), 1)

Affliction is most injurious to young people, as the 
Scripture says [Proverbs 17:22], "A saddened spirit dries 
up the bones," and everywhere the Holy Spirit forbids this 
sadness, as Eccles. Sal. 11:9, "Rejoice, young man, in 
thy youth, and let thine heart be good'er things in thy 
youth"; and shortly after [v. 10], "Put away sadness from 
thy heart, and put away evil from thy body." So also says 
Sirach 1) Cap. 30, 22-25: "Do not make yourself sad, and 
do not trouble yourself with your own thoughts. For a 
merry heart is a man's life, and his joy is his long life. Do 
good to thyself and comfort thy heart, and drive away 
sadness from thee. For sadness kills many people, and 
yet serves nowhere." So also Paul tells all the 
Corinthians [2 Cor. 7:10.] that the sadness of the world 
works death. Therefore, above all things, you must firmly 
insist that these evil and sad thoughts are not of GOD, 
but of the devil, because GOD is not a GOD of sadness, 
but a GOD of comfort and cheerfulness, as Christ Himself 
says [Matth. 22, 32.]: "GOD is not a GOD of the dead, but 
of the living." But what is living but being joyful in the 
LORD? Therefore get accustomed to such thoughts 
here, so that you immediately drive them away and say, 
"The Lord did not send you. This plea is not from the one 
who called you. In the beginning the struggle is hard, but 
through practice it will become easier. For it is not you 
alone who must endure such thoughts, but all the holy 
people; but they fought and prevailed. So do not give way 
to evils, but face them all the more confidently. 2) The 
highest task in this fight is not to look at these thoughts, 
not to investigate them or to follow their objects, but to 
despise them like the whistling of a goose and to pass 
them by. He who has learned this will be victorious, he 
who has not learned it will be defeated. For sound at 
them and dispute with them until they desist or give way 
voluntarily, that is, irritate and strengthen them. As an 
example serve you 


1) Also here, as in the previous place, Ecclesiast. (Eccl. Sal.), 
but it should be read Ecclesiastic. (Sirach) should be read. 
2) Virg. Aen., lid. VI, v. 95. 


The people of Israel who overcame their serpents, not by 
looking at them or by wrestling with them, but by averting 
their gaze and looking elsewhere, namely at the bronze 
serpent, were victorious. This is the right and certain 
victory in this fight. Therefore, my dear Jerome, see to it 
that you do not let these thoughts settle in your heart. 
Thus a certain wise man answered a man who was thus 
afflicted, saying, "How do such evil thoughts come into 
my mind!" He said, "Let them fall out again." This man 
taught by a very good saying. And another answered 
someone who asked the same question: You cannot 
prevent the birds from flying over your head, but you can 
prevent them from nesting in your hair. 3) Therefore, you 
will be quite right if you joke with others or do other 
pleasant things, and then do not feel guilty about the joke. 
For God does not like that very trivial sadness. For the 
sadness because of sins is short and at the same time 
pleasant because of the promise of grace and the 
forgiveness of sins, but that is of the devil and without 
promise, but a mere sorrow about useless and 
impossible things that concern God. More when | will

brother 4) to whom | had begun to write, but the 
messenger hurried. | will write to him at another time and

To the learned and at the same time godly jurist Peter 
Weller, his brother in the Lord. 

"Grace and peace!" Since the messenger, contrary to 
expectations, postponed his departure by an hour, best 
Peter, | wanted to send you this letter at least as a 
greeting, since we still have no certain news from 
Augsburg. First of all, | thank you for having moved into 
our house with your brother during our stay abroad, and 
for having become the comrade and protector of mine, so 
that they may live all the more securely and in better hope. 
| also rejoice that they are in your trust, and | will do 
nothing better than to please you and your brother 
wherever | can. | am indeed quite well, except that so far 
| have suffered not a ringing but a thundering in my head, 
and | cannot discover the cause. But of this at another 
time. 

The great ones: of our Reichstag run around 
cheerfully, or rather they sail and navigate the skies with 
their innate rudder. Early in the morning they set out for 
war in a hurry, armed with unconquerable beaks; thus 
they grant us peace throughout the day before their 
boastful songs of victory, while they plunder, rob, ravage, 
devour, for all have become men of war against the fruits 
of the earth. In the evening they return with very great 
triumph, joyful and full of victories, and they sleep wearily, 
but gloriously and victoriously, even gently. The other day 
we crept into their courts to see the splendor of their 
empire. But they were very afraid, suspecting that we had 
come to destroy their works of art: there was shouting and 
trembling, a miserable sight of the frightened. When we 
saw that we had frightened the likes of Achilles and 
Hector, we began to clap our hands and to throw our hats 
up bravely, thinking ourselves avenged if we could thus 
mock them and frighten them in various ways, merely by 
movements and gestures. And so much for revenge. This 
in jest, but in truth | believe that it means something 
(allegoriam esse) or is a prophecy, that so with the 





Words of GOD those right birds of prey (Harpyias) 
tremble, not the dates, 1) but, reversing the word, the 
nobles who now screech to Augsburg 2) and parrot. God 
grant, amen. Fare well in the Lord. Greetings Georg von

under the trees, and pears, cherries, spilling and plums; 
sing, jump and are cheerful; have also beautiful little 
horses with golden bridles and silver saddles. Then | 
asked the man who was in the garden, "Where are the 
children? He said, "They are children who love to pray, to 
learn and to be pious. Then | said, "My dear man, | also

and pears, and ride such fine horses, and play with these 
children?

tried to render Luther's play on words: monedulas - Edelmannos.

Then the man said, "If he is fond of praying and learning 
and is pious, let him also come into the garden, Lippus 
and Jost 1) also, and when they all come together, they 
will also have pipes, timpani, lutes, and all kinds of 
strings, also dancing, and shooting with small 
crossbows. 

And there he showed me a fine meadow in the 
garden, prepared for dancing, there were all kinds of 
golden pipes, timpani and fine silver crossbows. But it 
was still early and the children had not yet eaten, so | 
could not resist the dance, and said to the man: "Oh, dear 
sir, | will go quickly and write all this to my dear son 
Hansichen, so that he may pray diligently and learn well 
and be pious, so that he may also come to this garden; 
but he has a maid Lene, whom he must bring with him. 
Then the man said, "Let it be so, go and write to him like 
this. 

Therefore, dear son Hansichen, learn and pray 
confidently, and tell Lippus and Josten to learn and pray, 
too, so you will come to the garden with each other.

Grace and peace from God. Kind, favorable, dear 
Doctor! Know that the Lord and we 2) with Him are 
still fresh and healthy from God's grace. God grant 
you also all good with your children. You have done a 
very good work by sending the doctor the 
counterfactual, because he forgot a lot of thoughts 
with the picture. He has pasted it on the wall above 
the table, where we are eating, in the prince's 
chamber. -- When he first saw it, he could not know 
her for a long time. Well, he said, Lena is so black! 
But now he likes her, and the longer he looks at her, 
the more he thinks she is Lenchen. She looks more 
and more like the Hansichen with her mouth, eyes 
and nose, in sum with her whole face, and she will 
become like him. That's what | wanted to attribute to 
you this time. 

Dear Doctor! | beg you not to worry about the 
doctor, he is, praise God, fresh and healthy, has 
forgotten about his father in the first two days, 
although it made him very angry. As soon as he looks 
at Hans Neinken's letter, he says to me: "Well, my 
father is dead, too! Then he quickly takes his psaltery, 
goes into the chamber, and cries enough that his 
head was awkward the next day. Sint he let himself 
remember nothing more. On the Saturday before 
Exaudi 3), the groom was our guest for the evening, 
where the doctor, among other things, recounted how 
he had dreamed the next night, how a large tooth had 
fallen out, so large that he could not have been 
surprised enough. On the Sunday after that, the father 
was dead. | did not want to leave this undisclosed to

help support it verbally.

To the highly venerable man, Erhard Schnepf, the 

faithful servant of the Word in Hesse, his 
extremely dear brother. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! It is also a joy to me, as 
it is to you, my dear Erhard, that your prince has not 
despised this Diet, but has arrived; otherwise he would 
have weighed down not only himself with unbearable 
hatred, but also the whole cause of the Gospel, which is 
otherwise already sufficiently suppressed by these 
swarming spirits. The Lord testifies by such evidence that 
he is with us, and we see that our sighing accomplishes 
this, that the God of the humble and afflicted does not 
abandon us to the end, who gives that temptation may 
gain an end [1 Cor. 10:13]; to him be praise and glory 
forever and ever, amen. 

| have written a letter to this prince of yours, which you 
see before you, and if it is convenient for you, deliver it 
yourself, and if it is necessary, strengthen him with words. 
| can neither hope nor despair as far as his faith is 
concerned; therefore, perhaps | have not admonished 
him urgently enough, nor even duly enough, as the 
matter requires, that he should avoid the pestilences of 
those people and the quite trivial enticements of Satan. 
One thing | rely on in the whole matter is that Christ 
Himself promised to hear our prayers, as it is written [Ps. 
145:18.], "The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all 
who call upon Him earnestly"; and again [Ps. 34:18.], 
"When the righteous cry out, the Lord hears." Yea, and 
the same commandeth he also, saying [Ps. 50:15.], "Call 
upon me in trouble, and | will deliver thee, and thou shalt 
praise me." This shall be a wall of brass 


of me in your prayers, just as | am mindful of you. From 
the desert, June 20, 1530.

To the worthy man, Christ's servant, D. Martin Luther, 

his brother in Christ. 

Grace and peace from God the Father and from our 
Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Since | had received the 
opportunity of this messenger, which | could certainly 
assume would reach you, dearest brother in Christ, | 
could not avoid writing something to you, although | 
had nothing worthy of your ears, and also feared that 
| would sin against the common good, since | know 
that you are never idle. The emperor has finally come 
to Augsburg; we have nothing new yet, except that our 
people have neither wanted to take part in the pomp 
on Corpus Christi, nor have they given themselves up 
to free preaching; | say, however, of all our people 
who have so far received and held the word. However, 
there was a fierce battle over the sermons, the end of 
which was that all preachers were to be silent, except 
for those of the emperor, for he promised that he 
would decree those who would teach loudly, but ours 
retained the right to preach in their own inns. But this 
you may know better. It is said that Margrave George, 
our neighbor, said with great frankness before the 
emperor that he would rather lose his gray head than 
either deny God's word or be deprived of it. The 
emperor had answered: "not 2) to cut off the head, not 
to cut off the head!" because he understands neither 
German nor Latin properly, to our great detriment and 
to his shame, what he had said.

also recognizes. For he would wish to do without any 
other language and any kingdom, that he might speak 
German properly. 

We cannot yet foresee what will happen, nor do 
we have any certain advice, only that we ask God to 
help our cause and have confidence that this will 
happen. | have been compelled to write a letter of 
defense or advice these days as to how our people 
should behave, 1) in the opinion that | thought that |, 
too, would travel there. 2) | do not yet know what will 
happen; certainly | cannot produce anything worthy 
after Philip, whose confession (Apollogiam) | have 
seen and consider very good. While | was leafing 
through the Acts of the Conciliar above, | came across 
a passage of Clement's Apostolicae, in which the 
communion with wives is clearly advised, even 
commanded. 3) This is the fifth and last letter, and yet 
the papists do not only keep such null and void things, 
but also publish them. | liked this passage very much 
because it can be shown by this evidence that there 
is nothing under the name of Clement that is what | 
would like very much, although this passage seems 
to be suitable to ridicule, revile, and hypocritize the 
papists. Your last letter,*) although short, has been 
very pleasant to me, also for future use and benefit. 
By the way, since the matter that is being negotiated 
at the Diet is difficult, let us pray to the Lord that He 
may protect His Church, which | know you will do, but 
may you also pray for us that we may not forsake the 
Lord, for He will not forsake us. Fare well in Christ our 
Lord. Given at Nuremberg, June 21, 1530, your 
Andreas Osiander.

To the man to be highly honored in the Lord, Mr. 


Nicolaus Hausmann, Bishop of the People at 
Zwickau, his brother and superior. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have ordered my people 
in Wittenberg, my dear man, to send to you in Zwickau all 
the news that they have received from us, from which you 
will know what is happening in Augsburg at this Imperial 
Diet. | hope that all this has reached you, because | do 
not have time to write everything to everyone. Let us only 
pray diligently, as we have done hitherto, remembering 
how our fathers were saved. "The hand of the Lord is not 
shortened" [Is.59, 1.], then the matter is not ours, but his; 
he will surely hear us. 

| have written to your brother Valentin, 5) and 
comforted him as much as | could; you will see to it that 
the letter is given to him. | have leisure here now and am 
working on the translation of Ezekiel; in the meantime | 
am also doing some other things. 

The papists indeed raged mightily, but our prince, 
gifted with an admirable constancy, confessed Christ 
freely. Likewise also Margrave George. The unbelievable 
mildness of the emperor is praised extraordinarily; he 
seems to be provided by God with a good angel. You will 
learn more from Wittenberg. In the meantime, you too 
pray for me, you man of God; in His mercy, be well for 
eternity, Amen. From the desert, on Saturday 6) after

Hail! Your letters, in which you complain about our 
silence, ') have caused us great suffering. For we have 
written quite abundantly every week, 2) but | do not 
know by what fate the misfortune has been added to 
our very bitter and lamentable sorrows in which we 
find ourselves here, that we have been condemned to 
take the blame upon ourselves that you do not write 
to us. 

| have written you the beginning of the Imperial 
Diet. 3) The emperor greets our prince quite 
graciously, and | wish that our people would be more 
polite towards him. God would have you admonish 
our younger prince about this by letter. There is 
nothing milder at the emperor's court than the 
emperor himself. All the others hate us in the cruelest 
way. These days | have been with the Salzburger, 
who plagued me with a very long and oratorical 
account of all the troubles that have taken place in 
these years. He attributes all these troubles to us, and 
attached to it an epilogue written entirely in blood. 

Today, the articles of our Confession will be 
handed over first, for which God may grant happiness 
and prosperity. For up to now, all time has been spent 
on the preparatory work (prooemiis) for the Imperial 
Diet, on the presentation, on the exposition of the 
common evils, on the determination of the order in 
which the matters to be discussed are to be carried 
out. This is proceeding slowly, as is natural with the 
Germans. In Rome, after the meeting

kind. You see that this signifies the downfall of Rome 
through schismata. There is nothing new about the 
Turk, but it is reported here that he is still preparing a 
move at home. Our adversaries are indeed 
threatening us in such a way that they show that they 
have completely forgotten the Turkish danger. The 
Landgrave approves of our confession and has 
signed it. You will achieve much, | hope, if you fortify 
him with your letter about the Lord's Supper. Brenz sat 
with me when | wrote this and wept with me; he told 
me to write a greeting to you in it. Fare well. On the 
day after St. John the Baptist [June 25].

and are plagued by their servants daily in many ways,

[Matth. 10, 16.], in the midst of the wolves, this has 
also greatly increased our pain and sadness, that we 
see from your last letter to Urban 5) and from the letter 
to Doctor Caspar that our letters have not yet been

comfort that we are now seeking so much and only. |

within fifteen or at most twenty days. ' | alone have 
written to you about the death of my son Frederick; 2) 
| have also written of the death of Cardinal 
Mercurinus, the Grand Chancellor, and of many other

empty-handed without our letters. But we see that you 
are almost somewhat angry with us, who (the Lord 
knows) are without fault, and are constant in writing, 
and rather too verbose than negligent. We have made 
this known to Chancellor Brick, that the Prince sent 
this messenger on horseback, who will return here, 
and we ask and implore you for Christ's sake to make 
haste to inform us how many letters you have 
received within a month, or during this time that we 
are here. 7) That messenger, whom we sent at our 
expense 8) and to whom we had to give four gold 
florins, was not sent for the sake of my wife and ours, 
but for your sake. Now we have impressed this upon 
him above all things, that he should faithfully hand

When we asked him whether he had received more 
detailed letters from you, he seemed to talk timidly 
and somewhat darkly, and while he was talking, 
something of a bundle of letters, which he had left 
behind at Torgau, slipped out of his mouth. But 
afterwards, when we cornered the scoundrel, we 
could get nothing else out of him than that he swore 
that he had delivered the letters to Coburg. You will 
kindly let us know how the matter stands, so that 
we can take revenge on that wicked scoundrel and 
monster for our pain, if he has dared to deceive us. 

He should go straight to prison or, if he is convicted, 

be nailed to the cross, for | hate nothing so much 

as this wickedness and disloyalty of rude people. 

As far as the Imperial Diet is concerned, we have 
written everything to you in detail, at least what we 
have learned so far and which is of some importance, 
so that if | repeated it now, it would perhaps appear 
as something old. But about the Emperor's entry, if 
Spalatin's and my letter may not have reached you, | 
will send you the description of the pomp, which has 
been printed here. 

10) Recently, the Cardinal of Salzburg summoned 
Philipp Melanchthon through Wolfgang Stromer of 
Nuremberg for a private conversation. When the 
latter, since it was already the second hour of the 
night, had returned well plagued by him, he told early 
in the morning what they had spoken with each other. 
He said: "| have heard nothing but the most extreme 
threats and almost a death sentence. You will hear 
wonderful things about this orally, dearest father, how 
certain they are, as if no God were alive, how they rely 
on human power, how we seem to them to be ants 
and flies. 

We both, Philip and |, have also been to Cornelius 
Schopper, who was formerly at the court of the exiled 
King of Denmark, but is now the Emperor's secretary. 
He said, as he is wont to joke, "if we had money," 
we could easily buy any religion we wanted from the 
Welsh; but if we had no pennies, our cause would be 
a dry and barren one. For he says that it is not 
possible in any way that

the emperor, who is now so surrounded by cardinals 
and bishops, could approve and accept another 
religion than the papist one; so the old one is 
persuaded to him. In short, they rely on men and 
ridicule Christ. The Salzburg had said to Philip, after 
hearing the word "conscience" (conscientia): "Ah, 
conscientia! what conscientia, conscientia! The 
emperor will not suffer a mean disorder!" But the 
wretched people do not know how the name of the 
Lord is a strong fortress and a wall of brass, a strong 
armor against all the power of the devil and the world. 
The Lord has so far given us strength and courage 
against those threats, and has so far glorified the 
gospel of His Son by the greatest miracles, as we also 
see in the suppression of the peasant rebellion. If he 
is our help, they will not touch us with a finger, and if 
people touch us, they will not be able to harm us. 
Everything will turn out for the best. Fare well in 
Christ. Given at Augsburg, on the Saturday after the 
Octave of Corpus Christi [June 25] Anno 1530.

To the highly venerable man, Mr. Wenceslaus Link, 

his brother and superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! The messenger who suddenly and 
unexpectedly presented himself, my dear Wenceslaus, 
hurried so that | myself did not have time to write to our 
people in Augsburg. Therefore, we have only handed 
over to him the letters received from Wittenberg, which 
are to be brought to you, and | beg you, when you have 
received them, see to it that they are faithfully and safely 
sent to Augsburg. For | believe that you can easily do this 
there, since you have a lot of messengers at your 
disposal. Another time, when there will be time, | will also 
write to you and others in more detail. The psalm 
"Confitemini"” is laid out for Wittenberg and is to be 
printed with an eloquent explanation, so that it will 
displease me. In the meantime, greet everyone, Mr. 
Spengler, the abbot, Michael, Joachim, Eoban, 2) 
Osiander. If you could get my Lord Catharina "a shock" 
of oranges or about that much from good people, | would 
gladly pay her. She often pesters me with letters about 
this and says that they are not at Wittenberg. Fare well 
with your vine and your exceedingly lovely grapes. From 
the silent desert, on Monday after St. John's Day [27 
June] 1530. 

Your Martin Luther.

Johann Agricola to Luther. 
(Fragment.) 


The story told here is found in Spalatin's writing: "Etliche 
Historien, so sich auf diesem Reichstag zugetragen" 2c., in the 
St., Louiser Ausg., Bd. Luther himself uses the same in his writing: 
"Wider den Meuchler zu Dresden" (Against the Assassin at 
Dresden), St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 1706, § 14. What is reported 
in the second paragraph, ibid. col. 743, § 1, is inserted in the 
written answer of the Protestant princes to the emperor.

Agricola of June 30 (St. Louiser Ausg., vol. XVI, 750) is the answer 
to this letter, one must assume that the statement was already 
made on the day of the delivery or the reading of the Confession, 
June 24 or 25, and reported to Luther immediately thereafter. The 
Erlanger Briefw. places our letter on June 27. 


Excerpt from a letter written by Johann Agricola at the 
Imperial Diet in Augsburg. 1530. 

One of the highest princes said in an assembly of 
princes, aroused by anger: "They have inserted a 
writing, written on white paper with black ink. If we 
were emperors, we would answer them with a writing 
written with rubrics 1)." To this another answered: 
"Lord, if you want that, you must be careful that the 
presilge does not splash under your eyes." 

Our prince replied to the emperor's prohibition of 
sermons in the houses, saying that he could not do 
without the word any more than he could do without 
daily bread.

Of the arrival of the queens of Hungary and Bohemia in 
Augsburg and of a so-called prophet in Strasbourg.

Printed in Corp. Ref., vol. Il, 157, no. 753 (without the name of the 
addressee) and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VIII, p. 64. 


The Queen of Hungary and the Queen of Bohemia 
both arrived at Augsburg at the sixth hour on the day 
before Petri and Pauli [June 28], and were not 
received by any of the princes or rulers, whether this 
was because the emperor so willed or for some other 
cause unknown to us. Everyone was very frightened 
by the thunderstorm that occurred in Altenburg on 
Corpus Christi, especially because after the lightning 
strikes there was a great flood in the middle of the 
night. 

John Baptist, the Italian, a prophet to many until 


now, was in Strasbourg during the last Lent and} Coburg Fortress. 


proclaimed not only that city but also all of Germany 
doom if they did not repent. He said that he would go 
straight to Ferdinand to admonish him and threatened 
him with extreme destruction if he did not convert to 
God, even daring to claim that otherwise he would be 
delivered into the hands of the Turks and executed 
with an axe. It is not necessary for me to write how 
few are on our side, and how many are either on the 
side of the Pope or of the Sacramentarians.

letter; the Corp. ref. dates it "about June 29," the Erlanger Briefw.: 
"(June 30, 1530)" and the Copenhagen manuscript has the date: 
"July 1." Since, as is often the case, the letters from Augsburg 
were sent together to Luther by messenger, the Erl. Briefw. 
decides for June 30. By the advice of the theologians for the 
Protestant princes mentioned in this letter (s 3), which is dated 
only from the 28th, the dating of June 27th is excluded.

(Beginning of July? 1530.) 
Luther's concerns about quite a few articles. 


The only thing that is certain about this objection is that it was 
written about some of the so-called Torgau Articles, that is, the 
disputed articles that form the basis of the second part of the 
Augsburg Confession. "As to the time of writing (says the Erl. 
Briefw.), it can only be asserted that it must have been written 
before Luther's letter to the Elector of Aug. 26, in which Luther 
comments in more detail on some of the questions occurring in 
our report. It was produced by questions submitted (by the 
Elector through Spalatin?), which were sent to Luther (with a 
missing accompanying letter). Possibly they are the articles 
about which Veit Dietrich writes to Miller; then they would have 
to have arrived and been answered between Miller's presence 
at Coburg, end of June, and the date of Dietrich's letter, July 17." 
Férstemann lets them be placed at Wittenberg in the time from 
March 14 to 20; Bretschneider places our concern "about March 
26," Brieger, and him according to the Erl. Briefw., to the time 
assumed by us. Bretschneider, Férstemann and Knaake 


1508 


Letters from the year 1530. No. 1606.

consider Melanchthon to be the author, whereas Brieger says: "At 
first glance, Luther presents himself as the author: no one else 
has understood how to write." He is joined by the Erl. Briefw. 
agrees with him, and we are of the same opinion. Also the Cod. 
Rostoch. (Schirrmacher, p. 147) ascribes it to him, in its 
superscription: "D. M. Luther's other concerns." 


From the enclosures to  Briick's Geschichte der 
Religionshandlungen auf dem Reichstage zu Augsburg im Jahre 
1530 (im Weimarschen Archiv, Reg. L 1. 41, Bl. 329) in 
Férstemanns Urkundenbuch, Vol. |, p. 93; in Corp. Ref., Vol. IV, 
981 and again Vol. XXVI, 189; in Schirrmacher, p. 147 (from Cod. 
Rostoch.) and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VIII, p.72. 


The first article, of both forms of the sacrament. 


If one wants to act here, that only the one form should 
be confirmed, then our most gracious Lord should not and 
cannot grant at all, since the clear Scriptures of the 
evangelists and St. Paul stand, so that even the 
adversaries confess this, and have nothing more to 
plead, except that it was not decided by the Christian 
church. So it is also certain that all Christendom 
throughout the world and the holy fathers and bishops 
have used both forms in unison for over a thousand 
years, and even today no one knows from whom or where 
the One Form has been caught, and nothing about it is 
written in Pabst's laws. They vehemently dispute that 
nothing new should be started without the command and 
order of the Christian church. To this it should be said why 
they have not so far resisted that the One Form should 
not be torn down, which is a right evil innovation against 
the clear Scriptures. In the same way, they should have 
resisted many other evil new things, where they did not 
want to suffer any innovation. So this is not an innovation, 
but a return of the old previous custom of the whole 
Christianity, and obedience of the Gospel. 


The other article, from the priest marriage. 

Here our most gracious Lord cannot allow the priests 
to live without marriage, as before. For there is strong 
scripture that God created man and woman to multiply, 
Genesis 2 and 3.") And Paul 1 Corinthians 7:9: "It is better 
to be free than to be married. 


1) Rather Gen. 1, 28. 





Suffer rutting." Thus it is well known what terrible 
abominations of fornication and unchastity have resulted 
from the forbidden marriage. Also, such forbidden 
marriage has arisen not only without the approval of the 
Christian Church, but also against the Concilia, 
especially against the highest Concilium Nicaenum 
and Constantinopolitanum sextum, out of pure 
sacrilege and violence of the pope, which the priests in 
German lands have opposed and resisted for a long time. 

Above this, the Pope and his own rights do not punish 
the marriage of priests more severely than with 
deprivation of the priesthood, nor do they consider it 
heresy, nor do they put anyone under ban for it. Now, 
however, it is not only considered heresy, but also 
condemned, persecuted with sword, fire, ban and all 
plagues as the highest heresy. From the beginning of the 
world it has never been heard in any nation or country 
that anyone should be put to death for the sake of 
marriage and not rather be honored. And among 
Christians, should one approve of this against their own 
Scriptures and established rights? Our most gracious 
Lord cannot permit such great abominations, nor can he 
make his conscience partake of them. So every prince 
must see to it, as he is obliged to do, that where marriage 
should be forbidden, especially in these last weak times, 
that no vices such as the Turkish or Curtisan ones come 
into their lands, as has happened in some countries. 

And whether one could not obtain more, that one 
leaves the marriage to the parish priests, and remain 
canons, as they remain. For priests must keep house, 
which is impossible without a wife. 


The third article, from the fair. 


Our most gracious lord cannot and may not grant that 
he should leave the corner masses and purchase 
masses, as they were before, in his lands, or re-establish 
them. But the parish masses, where there are 
communicants, they are held in German or Latin, my 
most gracious lord shall base that they shall remain. For 
all the scribes among them consider the mass to be such 
a work that a priest, even if he is godless and 
unbelieving, may do for reward for the benefit of all 
Christendom, both for the living and the dead and for all 
creatures. 


1510 


Letters from the year 1530. No. 1606.

tur, which is a public idolatry. Whether they might now 
want to mend and gloss a lot, this need not strengthen 
such scribes' idolatry. For such glosses were not 
invented in those days, otherwise there would have been 
far fewer masses. For there is nothing in heaven or on 
earth that acquires forgiveness of sin or God's grace 
without united faith in the Word of God, for the sake of 
which Christ instituted the Mass, as he says: "Do this in 
remembrance of me. Since the corner masses, even the 
most holy ones, and the masses for sale are all based 
on the aforementioned idolatrous reason, that one wants 
to help people through them, as through a good work, no 
one can approve or help to establish them with a good 
conscience. Thus, even in the first Christianity and in the 
oldest fathers, there are no such idolatrous masses. 

So it is obvious that the masses are of no use for the 
dead, for whom they are most of all instituted, because 
the dead must of course be justified and blessed by their 
own faith, like all other saints. Rom. 10, 10: "With the 
heart one believes, then one becomes righteous" 2c. Nor 
do the words in the Lord's Supper suffer, since Christ 
says, "Eat, drink, do these things." Now the dead cannot 
eat, drink, and do these things with us. But it is shameful 
that we should eat and drink for the dead. Oportet 
coenam esse seu actum illum communem. Ergo 


non est sacrificium. 


The fourth article, of ordaining or consecrating. 

There is no better means of unity in these matters 
than for the bishops to relax their oaths and duties in 
order to bind the ordinands to ungodly doctrine and to life 
without marriage, because in this way they would remain 
in their dignity and rule, and would get enough priests. 
But where they do not slacken, they must fall and perish. 
For what are now learned and skillful fellows, they do not 
want to burden themselves with such oaths, driving and 
godless doctrine. And in the end they will come to the 
point that ordination and ordaining will no longer be done 
by the bishops, but as it is otherwise due. 


The fifth article, from the Pabstthum. 


If the pope wants to be lord or sovereign, we let that 
happen, for we do not consider how great an honor or good 
he has, but desire that he leave the gospel free for us (as 
he is obliged to do). If he does not want to preach it himself, 
nor promote the word, as would be right, then he may be 
and do what he wants on his conscience; it is not our 
business. 


The sixth article, from monasteries. 


It is also not due to our most gracious lord to restore the 
monasteries and to fill them with monks or nuns, and he 
may say: | have not appointed the monks and nuns, nor 
have | ordered them to go out, nor have | ordered them to 
go in again, nor have | granted them permission to go. 
Summa, our most gracious lord should only throw such an 
article from himself. 


The seventh article, from confession. 


It is to be granted that the parish priests are ordered not 
to administer the sacrament to anyone who has sought and 
requested absolution beforehand. For the absoluteness, 
because it is God's word and command, should not be 
despised. However, there must be a_ declaration 
(preclarification) that, in order to receive such absoluteness, 
it is not necessary for people to choose all sin. 


The eighth article, from fasting and difference of food. 


Because they themselves, the popes and clergy, did not 
keep the fasts before and still do not observe them, we do 
not know what to do with them. 


The ninth article, by the Sacramentirans. ") 


. Our most gracious Lord shall help to condemn the 
Sacramentarians 2) as erring heretics, regardless of 
whether they refer to a concilium, or shall do more. Because 
they do not want to or cannot hold with us, they thereby 
separate themselves from us, and do not want to give us 
any more. 


1) In the manuscript wrong: "Sacraments". 
2) Manuscript: "Sacramenter". 


1512 


We do not need to be afraid to accept their offer, as if 
our doctrine were still uncertain; but we must be certain 
in such a common public article, which must go daily by 
custom. If their plea and reason have been sufficiently 
heard, recognized, and settled, that they may not boast, 
they will be condemned unheard and unrecognized.

Melanchthon's concerns. 


But that imagined Gradus are humane traditiones, 
may be indicated manifold. 

Christ always punished the disciples when they asked 
which one should be the chief among them. 

Item, Paul commands Timothy to set bishops, does 
not send them to Petro. 

Item, Paul says, "If it be revealed to him that sitteth, 
let him that is in front hold his peace." 

Item, the Primatus is never held, is also not possible 
to hold, because there must be Christians in all the 
world. Now the ecclesiae in India have never come to 
Rome to have their bishops confirmed. 

Item, Jerome and others write that presbyter and 
episcopus is one degree. 


Luther wrote on the back of the sheet: 


Yes, because the Pope wants to enter into such 
things (as | said), | think we Lutherans want to help 
protect and handle his honor and supremacy better than 
the emperor himself and all the world. For we could do it 
without a sword, with God's word and power, which the 
emperor cannot finally maintain with his fist without 
God's power.

1514 Letters from the year 1530. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, favorable, 
dear lord and friend! Because you desire to know whether 
my petition is right, | will show you my first thoughts for 
good company, which | want to put on my petition as a 
sign of my theology. The first shall be a cross, black, in 
the heart, which would have its natural color, so that | 
would give myself a reminder that faith in the crucified one 
makes us blessed. For if one believes from the heart, one 
becomes righteous. Whether it is a black cross, it 
mortifies, and should also hurt, but it still leaves the heart 
in its color, does not corrupt nature, that is, it does not kill, 
but keeps alive, Justus enim fide vivet, sed fide 
crucifixi. But such a heart shall stand in the midst of a 
white rose, indicating that faith gives joy, comfort and 
peace, and in short, puts in a white, joyful rose, not as the 
world gives peace and joy, therefore the rose shall be 
white, and not red, because white. Color is the color of 
spirits and of all angels. Such a rose stands in the 
heavenly field, that such joy in spirit and faith is a 
beginning of the heavenly joy to come; now already 
comprehended in it, and grasped by hope, but not yet 
revealed. And in such a field a ring of gold, that such 
blessedness in heaven endures forever, and has no end, 
and is also precious above all joy and goods, as gold is 
the highest, most precious ore. Christ, our dear Lord, be 
with your spirit unto that life, Amen. Ex Eremo Grubok,

Brenz thanks Luther for Letter No. 1599, which has 
strengthened him greatly, and asks him not to be too concerned 
for Melanchthon.

often.

Hail in Christ! | have received your letter, my dear

it is impossible to express with what joy of heart | have 
received it and have been strengthened in my heart 
by it. |can never give you the thanks you deserve, nor 
pay you back for the great benefits you have shown 
us through Christ. If | owe anything to anyone on 
earth, | owe it to you. Therefore, my dear father (xxxx), 
continue to comfort the afflicted and to uplift the 
saddened. There is no cause for you to be anxious 
about Philip in your heart. He is afflicted, he is 
sorrowful, and he carries sorrow, | confess. But these 
griefs and worries amount to driving him to pray all the 
more fervently. For what can you pray if the matter 
does not touch your conscience? how can you 
strengthen faith by the promises if faith is not 
challenged by adversities? Therefore, Philip has good 
hope in the Lord. He has with him at home the 
Reminder, the Holy Spirit, so that he does not need 
the remembrance of me, a wretched man. How the 
matter of faith stands, | assume, has been written to 
you, dear sir, by others. Our confession has been 
heard by the emperor. We daily await the confession 
or rather the invective of the adversaries; what will 
happen after that, the Lord knows. You continue, as 
you are doing, to support the exceedingly good cause 
by your prayers. Fare well in the Lord. From 
Augsburg, on the day of St. Kilian [July 8], Anno 1530, 

yours, Joh.

To Justus Jonas, Georg Spalatin, 
Melanchthon, and Johann Agricola Eisleben, his 
peers, at Augsburg. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! We received the letters 
brought by Arnold and the Coburg messenger yesterday, 
and | believe you already have the answer of the 
adversaries, 1) which, as you write, is expected from you, 
namely: Fathers, fathers, fathers, church, church, custom 
and habit you will hear, moreover, nothing from the 
Scriptures, and trusting in these arbiters and witnesses, 
the emperor will make his pronouncement against you. 
Threats and boasts will follow to heaven and hell. But the 
Lord will give you mouth and wisdom. By the way, as you 
write: "Of other things verbally in a short time", 2) so do. 
More has happened than was expected, namely you 
have given to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what 
is God's: To the emperor a perfect obedience, in that you 
have appeared with such great cost, trouble and 
complaint; to God the chosen sacrifice of the confession, 
which will break through into all the courts of kings and 
princes, which will reign in the midst of his enemies and 
go out into all the lands with its sound, so that those who 
do not believe will have no excuse; namely, this will be 
the fruit of the silence commanded at the beginning of the 
Diet. If now this reward is added, that according to the 
testimony of the adversaries no article of faith has been 
violated, then we clearly obtain more than | have desired, 
namely we are freed from the shame of the heretic's 
name. May Christ Himself confess us as you have 
confessed Him, and glorify those who have glorified Him, 
amen. Therefore, | absolve you from this kingdom day in 
the name of the Lord. "Always home, always home!" 

Do not hope for concord or slackening, and even | have 
never asked God for it, knowing that it is impossible. 


1) The confutation was not read until August 3. 
2) Compare No. 1614. - As we see here, Luther draws brevi to} 
the preceding, not to the following; perhaps he did it jokingly.

Philipp |but only that they would allow you to teach and grant 


peace. Since they themselves remain in_ their 
godlessness, even if they wanted to help us, how could 
they? 3) If the emperor wants to issue an edict, he may 
issue it after all; he also issued one at Worms. We will 
hear the emperor as emperor, not further, not beyond. 
What is this disguised (/arvatus) emperor, the peasant,” 
to us? Here the same will create council, who has opened 
the door of the emperor and the kings to our confession, 
and if the emperor will push with force and weapons, 
which | do not hope, he will again create council. We will 
give way to the true emperor, but if the disguised emperor 
should do something, it will be something else. Therefore, 
obtain permission [to leave] from the emperor by leaving 
the prince's councilors there, who can cooperate in the 
remaining matters. Our cause is settled, and you will not 
accomplish anything better or more fortunate beyond 
that. That Campegius throws the power to dispense high, 
5) to this | answer with the words of Amsdorf: "I shit the 
legate and his lord in his dispensation, we want to find 
dispensationes enough." Since the Lord commands, do 
not concern yourselves with the servant's dispensation, if 
otherwise such a great robber and attacker of the realm 
can be called a servant. "Home, home!" The LORD JEsus 
uphold and comfort you who have labored for His name's 
sake and have been afflicted enough, Amen. From 
Grubok, Friday after Margaret [July 15] Martin Luther, 
D. 


3) We have framed this sentence as an interrogative sentence. 

4) Duke George. - We have put a comma in front of rusticus; 
this prevents De Wette's misunderstanding: Caesar rusticus, that 
is, "the emperor acting under Duke George's influence". Larvatus 
Caesar belongs together, rusticus is apposition. 

5) This refers to a passage in Melanchthon's letter to Veit 
Dietrich of July 8 (Corp. Ref., Vol. Il, 174): "Campegius says he 
can permit the use of both forms and the marriage of priests; with 
regard to the monks, he says, since the key is not lacking, it 
cannot be dispensed. There you hear the new religion of the 
popes. Only now they ask where the key is missing, whereas 
before, since this question was transitions, he could solve and 
bind everything."

1522 Letters from the year 1530. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! So | suppose, best 
Jonas, that you have already received the answer of the 
adversaries and are urged to the restitution; if you do not 
admit this, then a commandment of the emperor will go 
out, which will be enforced by the wisdom of the peasant 
1) and will be full of it. And why should we not let these 
water bubbles blossom with equanimity? If they did not 
do such a thing, what disgrace would they not carry away 
from this imperial day? Therefore, let us grant them these 
threats and water bubbles. What do they harm? They 
cannot think anything else or higher than that their 
threats are terrible, since they know that they will achieve 
nothing by force and by deed. | would say that we would 
be quite ungrateful if we did not indulge them in these 
boasts, especially if they admitted to us that we had not 
violated any article of faith. Would that God would make 
this word quite firm and certain, and that you would 
receive certain confessions and testimonies. "Let us 
make use of them, what is the point?" For when this word 
becomes certain, it will be a divine voice that has 
escaped from these fools, who have been overcome by 
the truth, quite unawares. He who has admitted this 
upper sentence (majorem) must also admit the lower 
sentence (minorem) and such a_ conclusion 
(sillogismum) as those people do not see now. Only 
be strong and stand firm manfully until they realize that 
their threats are not omnipotent. Then it will be different; 
so | think. Greetings M. Eisleben, Spalatin and all. For |

Hail! | hope that you have received the bundle of 
our letters in which we have written what is going on 
here. In the meantime, nothing new has happened 
that would be worth reporting. Nothing has been 
decided about our matter, and the opinions seem to 
me to be extraordinarily diverse. Sometimes some are 
willing to be fair, but these are soon reversed by the 
calumnies of ungodly people. 

Privately, the princes have been asked to abandon 
our cause. ' Our people answer today, and explain to 
the emperor that they are prevented by their 
conscience (religione) from betraying this cause. The 
refutation of the opponents has not yet been 
presented to us.

do a vow in the same opinion. Therefore it will follow

Faith. For what is left to us by which we can stand and 
live but this very faith, since all our works and words are 
so miserably destroyed and beaten to the ground that we 
not only do not deserve thanks for such great good 
deeds, by which we have helped the whole world, but 
also receive all evil for all good. If we were to live by 
works, where would our life be? But faith will not be 
beaten to the ground like this, nor will it be suppressed; if 
it reigns, we will surely live and not die, because the Word 
we believe lives forever and says to us (John 14:19): "I 
live, and you also shall live," because "the life is in Him, 
and the life is the light of men" (John 1:4). | believe, in 
fact, that in the meantime, as | write this, this matter has 
come to a conclusion (epitasin), and the emperor has 
threatened all horrible things, (that is) that you, too, have 
survived the battle with the highest danger. And yet God 
wanted me to be there, although in fact | am not absent.

complete it, so go to the heavenly bodies. Hail to thee, O 
boy, for thy valor! 1) "Who else would know what is world

commandment, they have blasphemed the name of God

the third, they have trampled underfoot the reputation of 
parents and authorities against the fourth, they kill and 
wage war against the fifth. What shall | say about the 
sixth? In the seventh they are thieves, in the eighth false 
accusers. And what do they not do and speak in the most 
shameful way? Above all these they condemn us as 
heretics to hell, and demand from us the right of

We condemn ours, which is contrary to it, so that they 
have not even given us a hair's breadth, we have 
conceded everything to them: "Aren't they fine fellows?" 
who would like us to take part in such things and be 
overwhelmed with the terrible horrors of the murders, 
which have already been committed and are still to be 
committed on innumerable souls, bodies and things, 
which have been bought by Christ's blood. It seems to 
me that Satan clearly sees his end, and out of 
unbelievable rage shows us his utmost and perfect 
foolishness in this last spectacle. For who should not 
gladly stake his life on it, who should not be hopeful in 
this matter, who should not boast and be happy for such 
a glorious and in many ways exceedingly clear display of 
godliness and innocence? To be sure, we must expect a 
more. "If thou shalt believe (he says [John 14:40.]), thou 
shalt see the glory of GOD." But we already see a great 
part in the so great judgment and vengeance of God, and 
it does not take place that we pity those Amalekites with 
a foolish devotion like Saul [1 Sam. 15]. Without God's 
will and man's will they want to perish, they ridicule our 
pity, condemn our pleas, exhortations, enticements, even 
persecute us with death and hell: they do not want the 
blessing, let it stay away from them; they want the curse, 
let it come to them, and they must be before the Lord 
always [Ps, 109, 17, 15]. If they are worthy of mercy, 
much more Christ, whom they pursue with such great 
rage that, if they themselves did not perish, Christ would 
necessarily perish. But | would rather that Christ reign 
than those people, if one of the two must be desired at 
all, and both cannot be preserved. Let Pharaoh perish, if 
Israel cannot be redeemed in another way. But here the 
pig teaches the Minerva. May the Lord, for whom you 
labor and work, look upon your sacrifice as He looked 
upon Abel's sacrifice, and may your burnt offering be fat 
[Ps. 20:4.], that you may see Cain inerrant and fugitive 
[Gen. 4:12.], Amen. Respectfully greet my lords Andreas 
Osiander, Johann Brenz, and those.

Grace and peace in the Lord! That our adversaries 
turn to invective and seek to provoke the emperor is a 
sign that they realize that they have no right cause, and 
this is something old but long known with Satan, that 
when he has overcome the truth, he turns the minds 
away to other things, so that in the meantime the cause 
is neglected. This is what his tool, Eck, did to Carlstadt 
in Leipzig, and often elsewhere. It is incumbent upon us 
to push against this on the matter itself and not to suffer 
that this cunning spirit distracts us. For only now do they

Grace and peace in Christ! My dearest Jerome, you 
must firmly believe that this challenge of yours is from the 
devil, and that you are so afflicted because you believe in 
Christ. For you see how safe and happy 


1) The Wolfenbittel manuscript and De Wette put this letter 
on November 6. Already Késtlin, M. Luther, vol. Il, p. 654 ad p. 
214, remarks: "The letter cannot be from Nov. 6, but comes from 
a time, when Weller was with Luther's wife in Wittenberg, but 
Luther was absent." Kolde, M. Luther, Vol. Il, p. 592 ad p. 339, 
says that it is "from your summer"; in any case it is to be put a 
considerable time before August 15. 


He has made the most ferocious enemies of the gospel, 
such as Eck, Zwingli and others. We must have the devil 
as our adversary and enemy, all of us who are Christians, 
as Peter says [1 Peter 5:8]: "Your adversary, the devil, 
goes about" 2c. Best Jerome, you must rejoice over this 
challenge of the devil, because it is a certain sign that you 
are holding a gracious and merciful God. You will say: this 
challenge is heavier than you can bear, and you are 
afraid that it will overcome and oppress you so much that 
you will fall into blasphemy and despair. | know this trick 
of Satan: if he cannot overcome someone by the first 
attack of the temptation, he tries to tire and weaken him 
by constantly stopping him, so that he falls and confesses 
that he is defeated. Therefore, as often as this temptation 
befalls you, beware that you do not engage in disputation 
with the devil 2) or indulge in these deadly thoughts. For 
this is nothing other than giving in to the devil and 
succumbing, but you must take care that you most 
strongly despise these thoughts given to you by the devil. 
In this kind of challenge and struggle, contempt is the best 
and easiest way to defeat the devil, and make an effort to 
laugh at the adversary and seek out someone to talk to. 
You must flee loneliness in every way, because then he 
seeks to suck you in particular, and stalks you when you 


2) Késtlin, M. Luther, Vol. I, p. 115, correctly states this rule of 
Luther, that mau should not get involved in the accusations and 
disputations of the devil, but despise them. The same canon is 
taught by Cordatus No. 467, St. Louis edition, Vol. XXII, 813, K 
51. Wrong in Preger, Tischreden Schlaginhaufens, p. 23, No. 67 
and, due to the wrong reading offered there: "more (mer) skillful", 
also in the argument p. XVII. The other codices offer: "nit skillful", 
an erroneous translation of non aptus in Cordatus. This should 
have been given, as it is in our edition, by : "not laid on", not 
inclined. Following in Preger's footsteps, Lésche, Analecta 
Lutherana etc., p. 242 f., No. 372, has even changed the correct 
reading "nit" to "mer." If Preger and Lésche were right, then in the 
example given of the bishop's sister, she would not have said: "| 
have forgotten her [the thoughts]", but would have had to say: 
Now | have been clever enough to dispute with the devil. This, 
however, would have completely overturned Luther's rule.

alone. The devil is overcome here by mocking and 
despising, not by resisting and disputing. Therefore, you 
must play jokes and games with my wife and the others, 
so that you destroy these devilish thoughts, and be 
careful that you are of good cheer, my dear Jerome. This 
challenge is more necessary to you than food and drink. 
| will tell you what happened to me once when | was 
about the age you are now. When | first entered the 
monastery, it happened that | was always sad and 
afflicted and could not get rid of this sadness. Therefore, 
| sought advice and confessed to Doctor Staupitz (I like 
to mention this man) and told him how terrible and 
frightening thoughts | had. He said: "You do not know, 
Martin, how useful and necessary this challenge is for 
you, because God does not train you like this for nothing; 
you will see that he will use you as a servant to 
accomplish great things. And so it happened. For | have 
become (for this | may rightly say of myself) a great 
doctor, which, of course, | would never have believed 
would happen at the time when | suffered this challenge. 
This will undoubtedly happen to you as well: you will 
become a great man; just see to it that you are of good 
and strong courage in the meantime, and be sure to 
remember that such sayings, which especially occur to 
such learned and great people, are not without prophecy 
and foreshadowing. For | remember that once a certain 
man, whom | comforted over the loss of his son, said to 
me: "You will see, Martin, that you will become a great 
man. | have often remembered this saying, for such 
words, as | have said, have a foreshadowing and 
prophecy in them. Therefore, be of good and strong 
courage and throw away these extremely terrible 
thoughts completely. And as often as the devil plagues 
you with these thoughts, immediately seek conversation 
with people, or drink a little more copiously, or engage in 
jokes and antics, or do something else cheerful. 
Sometimes you have to drink more, play, joke, and even 
do some little sin out of hatred and contempt for the devil, 
so that we don't give him an opportunity to 


We must not become conscience-stricken over the 
smallest things, otherwise we will be defeated if we are 
too anxious to sin in something. Therefore, if the devil 
should ever say, "Do not drink," you should answer him 
thus: "But | will drink primarily for this reason, because 
you forbid it, and even drink abundantly. Thus one must 
always do the opposite of what Satan forbids. What other 
reason do you think | have for drinking [wine] so freely, 
chatting quite freely, eating more often, than to taunt and 
torment the devil who had set out to torment and taunt 
me? Would God that | could commit some excellent sin 
just to taunt the devil, so that he would see that | 
acknowledge no sin and am not aware of any sin. We 
must completely put the whole law (decalogus) out of 
our eyes and hearts, we, | say, whom the devil so attacks 
and torments. If then the devil once holds our sins against 
us and makes us guilty of death and hell, then we must 
say thus: | confess indeed that | am guilty of death and 
hell; what then follows from this? So you will also be 
eternally damned! Not at all, for | know someone who has 
suffered and done enough for me, and his name is Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God. Where he will remain, there | will 
also remain.

the questions are enclosed, therefore this letter, which answers 
the enclosure, will have gone out at the same time as the reply to 
the letter. 


Doctors and such great men the eternal truth and 
wisdom of God can be refuted and captured 
exceedingly easily, as the Pharisees are an example 
of, who were sent away ashamed, confused and 
dumb, because they had asked whether one may give 
interest [to the emperor] 2c. [Matth. 22,16.ff.] This 
answer of Eck, Faber's 2c. was now read out last 
Wednesday [Aug. 3] before the emperor and the 
estates of the empire, 2) with a preface and postscript 
added in the name of the imperial majesty, as you will 
see from the German note inserted here. This reading 
also lasted two whole hours, but with an unbelievable 
reluctance, weariness and disgust of some of the 
more sensible listeners, who complained that they had 
almost been driven out by this quite cold, hackneyed 
little song (cantilena), and were extraordinarily 
annoyed that the ears of the emperor had been 
bothered with such a large pile of useless things under 
the title of Catholic doctrines. The Queen Mary's 
Chaplain 3) told us that they had improved theirs five 
times, cast and recast, embossed and recast, and yet 
at last a shapeless and confused mixture had arisen, 
and a mixture as when a cook pours several soups 
together. At the beginning, they put together a 
tremendously large book,” as Faber is a wordy 
compiler; the book grew by the amount of invectives 
and lies. But the emperor eliminated the third part of 
the book during the first improvement, so that hardly 
twelve or sixteen leaves remained, which were read. 
Our people asked for a copy or a duplicate; the 
emperor took it into consideration for the following 
day. Yesterday many expected nothing but 
condemnation by edicts, but the Mainz and some 
others advocated that a kind of truce be made, or 
some semblance of peace, until a future concilium. 
And yesterday the younger prince returned from a 
certain great one quite cheerful and serene. There is 
hope that at least for this time this postponement will 
be obtained, 


2) By the imperial secretary Alexander Schweif, in the same 
room of the Palatinate in which the Confession had been read out, 
the so-called Capellen-Stube, in which the emperor usually had 
church services held. 

3) Johann Henkel. 

4) Spalatin, Annalen, p. 148, reports: "There were probably 
two hundred and eighty leaves in the first one, but the Emperor is 
said to have shredded and rolled it so that no more than twelve 
leaves remained. Maj. is said to have so shredded and rolled it 
that no more than twelve leaves remained.

The Emperor received the news at this Imperial

had the name Triumphoferdinandus, had died in

news of this sad case, the good emperor said: The

the Lord be praised.

Grace and peace in Christ! Although | have forgotten, 
my dear Jerome, what | wrote to you in the previous letter 
5) about the spirit of sadness, and perhaps now write the 
same, so that | always play on the same string, 6) | will 
nevertheless, since all our temptations must be common 
to all, and without doubt, as | suffer for you, so also you in 
iturn suffer for me, also repeat the same. As there is one 
land the same adversary, who hates and persecutes each 
individual brother of Christ for the sake of the individual, 
Iso we are also one and the same body, in which each 
individual suffers for each individual, and this only 
because | worship Christ; so it comes about that in this 
Way one is compelled to bear the other's burden. 
[Therefore see to it that you learn to despise him. For you 
have not yet sufficiently learned this spirit, the enemy of 
spiritual happiness. And be sure that you do not bear this 
lalone, nor do you suffer alone. We all bear with you, and 
lall suffer in you. God, who commanded, "Thou shalt not 
kill," certainly testifies by this commandment that he does 
not want these sad and death-bringing thoughts, but living 
land exceedingly joyful thoughts, as also the Psalm 
declares [Ps. 30, 6.], saying, "He delighteth to live," and 
Ezekiel [Cap. 33, 11.], "I have no pleasure in the death of 
[the sinner, but rather that he should repent and live." 
Whereas 2c. Since it is therefore certain that God is 
displeased with such sadness, we have a firm consolation 
that if we cannot be free of this evil spirit (daemonio), we

|thoughts if we want to, but | know again that they will not

Concerns about how the Protestant estates should 


behave. 


This document is found only in Coelestin, tom. Ill, p. 42, 
without indication of its source, and printed from it in Erl. Briefw., 
vol. VIII, p. 191. - The determination of the time results from the 
following considerations: It is, as can be seen from the V. Stick, 
written after the reading of the Confutation on August 3. On 
August 15, the Select Committee of the Fourteen was formed, in 
which the negotiations were conducted that were to serve as a 
basis for a settlement. The Emperor had thus abandoned the 
intention of deciding on the matter alone. Therefore, the order to 


Il. the opinion and sum of the letter [to this Imperial 
Diet] 2) may be diligently insisted upon, namely that the 
Imperial Majesty has promised in the same that he will 
hear and recognize the cause of both parts and will make 
an effort that the discords of the church will be settled, the 
disputes will be settled in kindness and love, and just as 
all fight under the one banner of Christ, so also all 
unanimously confess one faith. If the opinion of this letter 
were not enough, there would be many who would put 
the cause of it and all the blame on the emperor; the 
Protestant princes would rather prevent this than allow it 
in a foolish way. 

Thirdly. Let it be added that the Estates have good 
hope that the Imperial Majesty will not make any 
presumptuous pronouncements about the state of 
religion before the matter is decided, nor will he arrogate 
to himself such a prestige that he will raise himself to the 
position of judge and arbitrator over God and his word. 

IV. However much the emperor may claim for himself 
the judgment of religion, the Protestant estates cannot in 
any way consent to this demand, since there would be 


raise this concern can only fall in the period from August 3 to 14. |danger that the emperor would determine something of 


this kind, which would be quite unlike and inappropriate 


Luther's opinion on the question of what the Protestant lt, the word of God, while it is written [Gal. 1:8] that even 


estates should do when the imperial majesty again 
demands that the judgment on the matter of religion be 
left to him. 

|. Let the speech begin immediately with the first 
beginning of the purified doctrine, and by the careful 
repetition of all circumstances let it be recalled to the 
Emperor's memory by what necessity and occasion the 
Protestant estates were driven and moved to it, that they, 
after having renounced papal idolatry, and having 
eradicated and rejected from the church the ineffectual 
foundations of godless superstitious customs and 
human statutes, have accepted and taken upon 
themselves to defend this doctrine, which they knew to 
be

August 10, but as the previous letter shows, our letter cannot 
have been written already on Aug. 10. 


if an angel came from heaven and taught a different 
gospel, one should not believe him. Since we are 
forbidden by God's command to believe the words of an 
angel, it behooves us even less to grant or favor the 
emperor than a man who strays from the path of the 
divine word. 

V. Since the Confutation had been read to the 
Protestant estates in the name and by authority of the 
Emperor, one could easily assume that the Emperor was 
not alone on the side of the adversaries,

Martin Bucer to Luther. 


Bucer wrote that after reading Oecolampad's dialogue, he had 
come to the conclusion that there was no real opposition between 
them and Luther, which he tried to justify. Melanchthon had put 
Bucer's opinion into articles that he sent him. But he, too, had 
summarized his opinion in articles, through which Luther would 
hopefully become more inclined to restore unity, especially since 
the progress of the Gospel was also being hindered in France by 
the existing discord. - Luther did not answer this letter.

of ours about the reality of Christ's presence in the 
Lord's Supper and yours as is commonly believed, 
after having recently read the Dialogue of 
Oecolampad 3) in which he sets forth the opinions of 
the ancients about this matter, | believe | have 
become certain that there is absolutely no difference 
among you. For since you do not maintain that Christ 
is in the bread spatially (/ocaliter), and acknowledge 
that, although Christ is in one place in heaven 
according to the body (corporis modo existat), he can 
nevertheless be truly present in the Lord's Supper by 
words and signs, | do not indeed see what is contrary 
to your opinion, that ours maintain that the bread is a 
sign and figure of the body of Christ, and that he is in 
some place in heaven. For they acknowledge that the 
bread is a sign and figure of the present Christ, not of 
the absent one, and that through the sacred emblems 
(symbolis) not only the memory of him but also Christ 
himself is truly made present (sisti). | have discussed 
this with the highly learned man, Mr. Philippus, who 
has put my opinion into articles,*) which he sends to 
you. 
| also send you the articles in which | have 
understood the same opinion, adding, however, the 
way in which Christ is perceived as present in the 
Lord's Supper, namely, with the eyes of the mind 
(mentis). Likewise, that it is primarily the work of Christ 
himself that he presents his body and blood to us in 
the Lord's Supper, although he makes use of our 
ministry for this purpose. For | know that those of us 
to whom | had to send these articles were not deterred 
by anything else in your way of speaking.

Bucer (ex jpsius ore), can be found in Corp. Keim, Schw. 
Refgesch., p. 232, says about them: "Hardly at home from the

too Lutheran and had touched on the doctrine of ubiquity. So he

They think that it 1) ascribes to the work of the servant 
and to the signs (symbolis) that which is Christ's 
alone, then also unites Christ's body with the bread 
either naturally or spatially, which Oecolampad has 
abundantly testified in his dialogue. In order that this 
addition may not be offensive to you, | have made use 
of the words of Cyril and Chrysostom, which make all 
this understandable. 2) Since you are fighting 
primarily for the true presence of Christ in the Lord's 
Supper, which we admit, | implore you, for the sake of 
the glory of Christ, which is too much obscured by this 
unfortunate discord between us, to allow the holy 
harmony between us to be restored. We say (and this 
is the matter at issue) that ours have not contested 
anything else than that Christ's body is said to be 
either naturally united with the bread or spatially 
enclosed in it. You, however, have never asserted 
this, but have only disapproved that in the Lord's 
Supper nothing but bread and wine is offered, and that 
it is denied that Christ's body and blood are truly 
present through the words and sacraments. Then, in 
order that the words in which we may agree may have 
all the greater prestige, let us publicly confess on both 
sides that our faith and our doctrine of this mystery is 
and should henceforth be that which the Canon of the 
Council of Nicaea 3) teaches, and which all the 
ancients follow. 

We have recently received letters from the brethren 
in France, who write that the Gospel is beginning 
happily among them, but that this unfortunate discord 
of ours is so opposed to its progress that if it is not 
settled, they cannot hope that it will ever happen that 
France will hear the Gospel publicly. But if they should 
succeed in dampening it, they have good hope that it 
will happen in a short time that Christ will appear in 
public among them. For the king is not averse to the 
truth, and now that he has brought his children to 
France, he is not averse to the truth.

2 ) The expression Bucer uses here: xxxxx faciunt, is 
ambiguous, and could also be translated as: "which make all this 
something that lies only in the imagination". Bucer's fifth thesis 
would also allow this translation. Melanchthon says about the 
view of Bucer and his comrades (Corp. Ref., Vol. Il, 223): Dicunt, 
corpus Christi vere adesse, sed contemplatioue fidei, id est, 
imaginatione.

the emperor, at least in this matter. Then the extremely 
Christian heroine, the king's sister,5) never lacks her 
service. Yes, also a great number of the great ones 
have already joined the truth. In a certain region of 
Normandy, so many already profess the gospel that 
the enemies have begun to call it Little Germany. In 
the meantime, however, since, as it is wont to happen, 
because we are divided, some follow our opinion of 
the Lord's Supper, while others follow yours, which in 
truth is one and the same, even though it has hitherto 
been presented in different words, many who might 
otherwise be won over are alienated from the gospel, 
and a weapon is put into the hands of the enemies with 
which they can contest the truth that has only recently 
arisen. They say: "These people are not united among 
themselves, which does not happen with those whom 
the spirit of Christ drives. 

For this cause, therefore, the brethren who are 
there waiting for the redemption of Israel have very 
sacredly exhorted us, by order of the Queen of 
Navarre, to use diligence and effort, as far as it is 
possible, so that at last this discord may be subdued, 
by which they have added a spur to those who were 
certainly already running of their own free will. It is also

disagreement cause the churches to be troubled 
longer. 

May the Lord be with your spirit, you most valiant 
defender of Christianity. Would that God were here to 
guide the cause of Christ against the enemies of 
whom we have learned that they are armed with no

Landgrave Philip of Hesse to Luther. 


The landgrave sends the copies of the "indiscriminate means" 
proposed by the papists and the "Protestants' answer to them" 
(St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, no. 1046 and no. 1047), complains 
that Melanchthon's pusillanimity has left too much to the 
lopponents, and asks for Luther's concern. In the postscript, he 
loffers Luther an asylum with him if he should need one. 


Printed in Neudecker, Urkunden, ,p. 153 (from the Cassel 
archive) and in Erl. Philips von GOtts Gnaden Landgraf 
zu Hessen 2c. 


Dear, dear special! We are sending you copies of 
what has been done and sent to us by our council 
since our parting in Augsburg in the matter concerning 
the 1) Holy Gospel, and we believe that Philippi 
Melanchthoni's pusillanimity is to blame for the fact 
that things have happened so strangely. They have 
also committed too much in their submitted articles. 
For since the opposite does not want to allow the 
Word of God to be proclaimed in their lands, nor to 
receive the Sacrament in either form, nor to allow 
religious and priests to marry in any other way than at 
a concilium, and tolerate us immediately [as if] we 
were wrong, and we_ should accept their 
commandments in fasting, eating fish and meat, and 
keeping holidays, and tolerate them as if they were 
right in their thing, and let them, the bishops, be 
judges of our preachers, who would no doubt not 
suffer them long: the gospel would thereby be 
depressed and the old abuses would be 
reestablished, which we by no means mean or are 
willing to accept. Because it is a worthy cause, in 
which mighty and much

advice and good intentions in this matter, and that you 
know how to judge us accordingly; For we are of the 
opinion that, although we create peace for our 
countries and benefit ourselves by approving these 
articles, 1) where we want to be Christians, the 
common benefit should take precedence, 2) and the 
poor communities, which are burdened here and 
there with the infallible burdens under the popes and 
bishops, and which daily hope in God's grace and His 
word, are more to be regarded and considered than 
special benefits. It would not only cause us evil 
reproach, but would also give the Gospel trouble, if 
we were to allow ourselves to be entangled again with 
such human statutes and commandments by those 
who do not want to be corrected, because they do not 
want to accept God's word, from which they are to be 
corrected, nor allow it to be preached. We would not 
do this to you in your gracious opinion; do us a special 
favor and we will recognize it justly. Dat. Friedwalt,

This messenger brings us letters from Augsburg that the

now waiting to see what the Emperor will conclude and 
judge. It is thought that everything will be postponed until 
a future concilium; for the Bishop of Mainz and Augsburg 
are still holding firm, and the Count Palatine, Trier and 
Cologne do not want to go to war. The others would like 
to rage, and provide that the Emperor will command in

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime Highborn Prince,

request | hereby give my opinion to E. F. G.. F. G. | 
hereby give my opinion humbly to E. F. G. that | have now 
written three times to Augsburg to ask them for it, since 
they also demanded my advice. They finally wrote me the 
answer that the action had come to an end, but that these 
indicated pieces had been proposed, but not accepted by 
our people and that they wanted to have that part even 
more. And, since God was in favor of them being 
accepted by us, the dispute would have begun anew, for 
| would not have liked to concede so far to the devil that 
we should praise that part and condemn ourselves. 
Therefore, let E. F. G. not worry. For my sake (God's will) 
nothing shall be forgiven me in this matter. So now the 
matter stands in the Emperor's judgment, that 3) one 
waits, how | will make up my mind, that this will ever be 
attributed to E. F. G. as well. But | thank God that He has 
preserved E. F. G. so steadily, and | pray that He will 
preserve and strengthen E. F. G. until his day, amen. And 
| also sincerely thank E. F. G. for his gracious and 
comforting prayers, that they are so willing to accept me.

Luther wrote that he had to hear many complaints about his

that they iraave nothing of the Gospel; he asked him to write in 
detail about the last events so that he could shut up the accusers.

To his extremely dear brother, M. 
Melanchthon, the servant of the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! You do not believe, my 
dear Philip, with how great clouds of speeches and 
letters, full of complaints about you, especially about you, 
| have been showered, according to your letters. ') | write 
this unwillingly, since | am so minded that | fear to make 
you grieved even in a small matter, since you should 
have nothing but comfort from me in the so great burden 
of this matter, which | have hitherto faithfully endeavored 
to carry out in this matter. But now | also have to struggle 
with ours and their letters. | defend myself like this: First, 


Philipp 


| say: The Augsburgers write to me differently about] reste Coburg. 


these things and not about such things. However, | am 
firmly of the opinion that | believe you rather than them, 
and | do not hope that you are hiding something from me 
when it concerns the matter. Then | am sure in my 
conviction that you will not admit anything unless the 
confession remains intact and the gospel is excluded. 
But what this is, that the gospel and our confession have 
been delivered, is it necessary that this should be made 
clear to you? For this is what we have freely pledged 
ourselves to from of old, that we will suffer and do 
everything, even toward our enemies, that we can do 
without violating conscience and the gospel. Therefore | 
have been calm and have not feared anything for the 
cause, but have been concerned about violence and 
deceit on your part. Therefore, for the sake of Christ, | 
ask you to write to me as soon as you can, perhaps 
through the Nuremberg mail, about what has been done 
in the meantime, since your last letters. For 

1) Meant are the letters of Melanchthon and Jonas, which are 
also mentioned in the next number. They are not available. - 
Luther sent our letter and the following letter to Jonas to Spengler 
in Nuremberg for further order. But because it had become known 
in the meantime that the Elector would leave Augsburg on 
September 23 at the latest and that the farewell to the Reichstag 


was imminent, Spengler did not send the letters, but sent them 
back to Luther.

The letters of ours, which cause great concern

for the cause has not occurred in the meantime. 
Someone rumored something like that the other day at

denied it and said: "They have not written to me, | will wait 
for the letters; therefore, get to work on it so that | have 
something to shut them up with. For what | have 
answered them hitherto by letters and words, they have 
esteemed little, and have had no power. May the Lord 
Jesus uphold and guide you in his grace and mercy,

No 1713. 
(Feste Coburg.) (October 4, 1530.) 


To Hans von Sternberg on Callenberg. 


Luther recommends to him the case of the pastor Johann 
Weybringer at Hildburghausm. - Luther gave this small letter to 
Weybringer when he was with Luther in Coburg to get advice 
from him in the various difficulties he was having with his 
preachers and pastors. "This little letter" (as Weybringer calls it) 
he was supposed to insert into one written by himself to 
Sternberg. The Erl. Briefw. brings Weybringer's letter, vol. VIII, p. 
279, from which the time determination for ours results. 


From the Cyprian collection in Gotha in Schutze, vol. |, p. 408; 
in De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 412 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 54, p.

date 1528".

No. 1714. 
Coburg Fortress. 2) October 5, 


1530. 


To Hieronymus Baumgartner in Augsburg. 


Luther sends him his letter to Senfel (No. 1712) with the 
request to forward it. 


The original is in Munich (with the inscription by the recipient's 
hand: 1530. Augustae 21. Octobris). 
Printed in De Wette, Vol. 1 V, p. 176 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VIII, 
p. 282. 


To the extremely dear man, Mr. Hieronymus 
Baumgartner, Nuremberg city councilor, his 
superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! That | have not answered your 
letter, best Jerome, has happened partly because there 
was nothing available that should have been answered, 
partly because | wanted to postpone it until this day, on 
which | would leave this desert, so that I, since | would 
have such an occasion to write, said goodbye to you. But 
it is this occasion, namely that you would see to it that 
this letter is handed over to the musician Ludwig Senfel, 
because he has asked me that, if | wanted to send 
something to him, | would send it through you, because 
in this way, he thought, it would reach him reliably and 
comfortably. Therefore, | also ask you to fulfill and 
strengthen the good confidence he has in you, and to 
send the enclosed here to him when the opportunity 
presents itself. For | 


2) From Luther's words at the beginning of this letter: "I 
wanted to postpone [the answer] until this day, on which | set out 
from this desert", two things can be inferred with certainty], first, 
that Luther wrote the letter on the day of his departure, that is 
October 5; second, that this happened at the fortress Coburg. 
From this follows that the alleged date at the end of the letter: 
prima _Octobris is wrong, and that Altoburgo must not be 
dissolved by "Altenburg". It will have been read (which could 
easily happen) prima from quinta, and Altoburgo is to be taken 
as an appellative, and must be translated by: "from the high 
castle". The attempt of Késtlin, M. Luther (3.), vol. II, p. 659 ad p. 
250: "Luther may have really sent this letter from Altenburg, 
because he did not find the opportunity to do so in Coburg on the 
day of his departure", is invalidated by the fact that: Ex Altoburgo 
is written in the letter itself, which Luther dispatched ex hac 
eremo. Furthermore it is to be noted that Luther "Altenburg" never 
by Altobur 

gum has given. Only once can be found Aldenburgi 
(Erl, Briefw., VI, p. 68), also only once Aldenburgii (Erl. Briefw., 
VIIl. p. 54); otherwise always Aldenburga 
(Erl. Briefw., VI, pp. Il. 28. 56. 57. 62. 88" 247.; VII, p. 148).

If a person obtains something with the consent of the 
commonwealth, he is obliged to give it. 

Thirdly, it is true that the emperor has pledged and 
sworn to us as well as we to him, and we are not 
sworn to him alone, but to him and to the empire at 
the same time. If then the emperor does not keep us, 
he has made himself a common person 1) and can no 
longer be regarded as a true emperor, but as a 
peacebreaker, first of all because he is not a 
hereditary emperor, but an elected emperor. 

Fourth, the emperor has said at all imperial 
congresses and written from Hispania that he does 
not consider himself a judge in these two-split matters, 
but that it is due to a Coencilio to discuss and settle 
such matters. Since he, the emperor, now confesses 
this himself and once threw away such a judge's office 
(if he had already had the right, as he was not to judge 
at home, but only over body and goods, but also with 
a measure), how can such a thing be allowed to him 
now? first of all, because he acts so partial that he is 
plaintiff, judge and answerer, and again neither wants 
to see, hear nor accept our answer, which is too much 
according to pagan laws. 

| will not indicate this time how the election with this 
emperor and [the] future king has proceeded and [will

Fifth, if it be said that the emperor had no power, 
but that because the emperor and the estates

all the less power to defend ourselves, | say to this: 
First of all, it is not true that all the estates have 
compared themselves to him, the emperor. For | know

Ernst of Baden, Duke Erich of Brunswick, the Bishop 
of Augsburg, Duke Ludwig of Bavaria, Count of

there are still many who do not want to have such an 
extermination of the truth, as namely Mainz, 
Palatinate, Trier, Saxony, Margrave Jérg of 
Brandenburg, Heinrich Duke of Mecklenburg, Duke of 
Holstein, Philipps, Ernst, Otto, Franciscus, Dukes of

and others. 

From the above princes and cities (not to mention 
some many counts) it is clear that the noble princes 
and estates did not consent to such a thing; therefore, 
the claim that the emperor decided unanimously with 
the common estates cannot stand either 2c. Even if 
there were more of the other estates, they are still the 
least, and come into this matter through finances 5) 
and for their own benefit. And therefore they should 
be rejected, the bishops, who are so bloodthirsty, 
because they themselves are the ones who are most 
hostile to this evangelical cause for the sake of their 
avarice. The angry princes are also rightly rejected, 
who for the sake of their hatred, which they have for 
some persons, because their vices have been pointed 
out to them,® have such a thing as the gospel, 7) 
which they find so clear that they themselves do not 
oppose it with truth, and yet persecute and hasten it 
to the utmost. If then such fierce and selfish people 
are put aside, and their voices are not valid, as it 
should be in truth, then the emperor stands alone.

God did not abandon His own in the Old 
Testament, nor did He let a country perish that trusted 
in Him. 

Likewise, he also helped the Bohemians, and yet 
we must all confess that the Bohemians are under the 
emperor, and that a king of Bohemia (Beheim) is one 
of the noblest princes. They still refused against the 
emperor and the empire, and God gave them victory 
and overcoming. So | also hope in God, if we only trust 
in Him undauntedly. 

God has also helped several emperors and others 
who have acted with violence against their subjects 
without justice. Example: See how a small number of 
Swiss have beaten the lords of Austria and several 
emperors; although this example does not apply to 
this matter. Date ut supra.

superior and brother in Christ. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Dearest householder, | 
read your letter about Petzold's marriage case and 
promised that | would write to you about this matter, 
which | do, and which you can tell him. First of all, since 
he is in such a place where the authorities either cannot 
force his wife to him or do not want to do so, or at least 
expel her, but the clergy defend her (as he tells), it 
cannot happen that he marries another in the same 
place, nor will they suffer this, therefore he would 
undertake this in vain. Therefore one of these two things 
must be done, that he either changes the place and 1) 
marries another one. 


1) Here we have assumed et with Aurifaber. In the original vel 
should be found. The latter is in any case erroneous. 


| do not see either of these two things as being in the 
middle. | do not see either of these two things as being 
in the middle. Among these two things | see no middle 
one. That is my opinion. 

May you greet the prince's preacher 2) many times in 
my name and tell him that he does not in any way 
undertake to administer the sacrament secretly, since he 
is not called as a servant to this work, so that no occasion 
is given to the adversaries, or (as Paul says [Col. 4, 5.]) 
to those who are outside, a cause for blasphemy. 
Meanwhile, they may suffer what they suffer on both 
sides. GOD will finally put an end to these things as well. 
Cordatus wrote to me, and | answered. Through such 
cases, my thoughts certainly come to the point that | 
would almost like to wish a day of rest (sabbatum) for 
your spandrels, that is, that they would have to be 
completely deprived of the service of the Word for a time, 
and of both a pastor and a preacher, whether these sated 
and unruly sows might perhaps be cured by hunger and 
lack of the Word, which become so insolent through 
satiety and abundance. May you therefore also go away! 
If | can, | will take the cordatus away. If | am asked for it, 
| will see to it that they have none. For they think that the 
world is full of idle servants of the word, that they can 
easily get such as they want. But more at another time. 
Greetings to your brother and all our brothers in Christ. 
From Torgau, 3) Wednesday after the eleven thousand 
virgins [Oct. 26].

Torgau. 28 October 1530. 

To the Landgrave Philip of Hesse. 

Luther informs him that he would have intended to write about 
the Augsburg Treaty even without the Landgrave's request; he 
has already expressed his concern to the Elector about the 
question of resistance, and he hopes that it will pass off without 
bloodshed 2c. 


2) The castle preacher in Zwickau was Lorenz Soranus. 

3) Luther was in Torgau because of the negotiations about the 
counter-defense, which took place there between the 
theologians and jurists.

Grace and peace, from Christ. Most Serene, 
Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | have received E. 
F. G.'s writing and several instructions 1) in the present 
matters. And first of all, that E. F. G. desires to issue a 
booklet for the consolation of the weak, | will not refrain 
E. F. G. from issuing a booklet shortly, 2) in which | want 
to touch the farewell and clumsy behavior of the princes, 
with admonition of every (jder's) conscience that no 
subject is guilty where Imperial Majesty would insist on 
it. Maj. would insist on obeying, but will (as much as my 
pen can) deter from such obedience, that no one should

plots, God grant that | create much fruit with it, amen. 
Nevertheless, it shall be kept safe, so that it may not be 
reproached seditiously. 

On the other hand, | hope that God will find a means 
that no bloodshed will occur for the sake of these things. 
Thus | have also (if it ever comes to that, since God is 
for it!) indicated to my most gracious lord, the Elector, 
my opinion as to what should be done about the counter- 
revolution, which will undoubtedly be hidden from E. F. 
G., because | see and realize that one will have a 
common counsel about it, and it is dangerous for me, as 
a spiritual person, to present such in writing, for many 
reasons. 

And please, let E. F. G. not be alienated that we 
offered ourselves several times in some pieces, than to 
accept with fasting, celebrations, food and songs, 
because we know that they can not accept it with such 
measure, and serves us that we raise our glimpses the 
higher, and | may drive their glimpses in my booklet the 
more violent. So it is not a mistake for us, where it would

Luther jokingly reproaches him for his continued silence. 


Printed in Schutze, Vol. Il, p. 194; in De Wette, Vol. IV, p. 184 
f. and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VIII, p. 300. 


Grace and peace in Christ! That you quarrel with me 
about my silence, my best Amsdorf, you are doing nothing 
else than giving me cause to quarrel with you with the 
greatest justification about your so persistent and 
constant silence. For since you knew that | was in 
solitude, you not only did not take pity on me by 
comforting me with your letters, but also added pain upon 
pain by distressing me with your constant silence. And 
now you are already increasing your sin again by 
accusing and scolding me on top of it because of a guilt 
that is not mine but yours. You have forced me to assume 
that you might have become Archbishop of Magdeburg in 
the meantime, Primate of Germany, that you so easily 
forget me, who am so poor, and peel me so arrogantly. 
How else can | assume that this is because you reproach 
me for calling the bishop of Mainz "Most Reverend 
Father",*) than because you think that this title is perhaps 
taken away from you, although | have used this word not 
differently than according to the usage of the courts, 
according to which those are called gracious (gratiosi) 
lords who are even furious (furiosi) devils. But with one 
thing you have made me happy, that you have published 
the booklets that have come out this summer.

With the same sluggishness the printers go ahead, 
because they still have two little books under the press,

when you come to greet us, which | hope you will finally 
do, so that we may refresh ourselves by an exceedingly 
sweet conversation before we are separated. For | feel 
that | am getting very old or at least am losing strength.

with you in grace and steadfastness, amen. Wittenberg,

To the City Council of Herzberg. 
Luther had interceded for a woman to whom he had received 
an unfavorable response, so he repeats his request in this letter.

1) This passage has been a crux interpretum. De Wette 
remarks: "Something seems to be missing here." Férstemann, in 
the Hall. Allg. Literaturzeitung, 1829, Sp. 14, translates thus: "My 
sickliness did not allow me to publish several (sc. books), after all, 
| could hardly spend half or a little more of the time spent in the 
wasteland (sc. at Koburg) on the ones | did publish!" This 
translation seems to us to be mistaken. The addition we made in 
square brackets is justified by the fact that the infinitivus perfecti 
(laborasse), and not the inf. praesentis (laborare) is used.

different, except to help settle and put things to rest. What 
else should | seek in other people's affairs, and what 
business would it be of mine to create unhappiness for 
myself or others in another's affairs? Therefore, my 
friendly request is once again, do not regard my writing 
as your letter suggests. If | cannot create good things, | 
would not like to create painful things. And because you 
might otherwise judge me according to your writing, | ask 
you once again to drop the matter and, if it pleases you, 
send the cubits to me, considering that you are not 
helped by it, where you inflict such a disgrace on the 
women, because it is in your free power to let up, and 
perhaps afterwards you would regret and bite in your 
conscience, since you would not be able to help it nor to 
improve it, and it would be seen as if you had no regard 
for intercession, but as if you had straightway atoned for 
vengeance according to a conceived displeasure, and for 
such a_ small matter had caused so much 
unpleasantness, and had saddened many hearts without 
such need, just as if you had not had to daily let go and 
tolerate many more and greater cases than the beams 
against this splinter. Please give us your correct answer.

Stephan Agricola to Luther. 
(Regest.) 


Agricola and Frosch had been in exile for months and did not 
know where they could finally find a home with their wives and 
children. For the time being, they were living in Nuremberg in the 
St. Aegidien monastery, still receiving a salary from the 
Augsburgs, but were uncertain whether they would be called 
back there. The council there is said to have declared that it does 
not consent to the Emperor's decrees insofar as they concern the 
faith, but God alone knows whether this was done out of fear of 
the common people or out of love for the word. The 
Sacramentarians there boast that Luther has given way to them; 
the papists cry from all pulpits that they (Agricola and Frosch) 
have seduced Augsburg and infected it [with heretical doctrine]. 
Now he asks that, if they cannot return to Augsburg, an 
appointment be worked out for them with the Elector, for which 
the Chancellor Brick has also made a prospect. Luther may 
intercede for them with the prince.

1530. how things stand (rationem) with the Diet of 


Augsburg, and perhaps you laugh that in so long a

many attempts, through so much action. But | have 
this opinion about it, that there has never been any 
imperial diet in which more was done and 
accomplished by much action than in this one by 
accomplishing nothing. You ask: What are these 
accomplished things? | will tell you in a few words. 
Our adversaries have been declared and made 
manifest as true Pharaohs and Antichrists in this 
Kingdom Day. For before it was still hoped that there 
was a heart of flesh in the adversaries, it was hoped 
that they would repent of some kind; but now, 
although everything has been tried, all means of 
comparison have been conceded, that we have often 
suffered the worst calumny from our own even for this 
cause, and yet the adversaries neither acknowledge 
this nor repent, but on the contrary condemn and 
rage: do they not declare by obvious evidence that 
they are Pharaohs and antichrists? If there were even 
a trace of godliness in the whole papist body, it would 
certainly have broken out through these means by 
which those people have been tempted. 

In addition, they often freely confessed at earlier 
imperial congresses that there were many errors and 
abuses in their church, but now they do not even 
admit this. The emperor's presence makes them such 
pure and holy people. For so they write in the article 
about holding a council: "Because there may be some 
errors in the church, therefore we want to hold a

Bugenhagen reports that he arrived in Lubeck on October 28, 
and that soon after his arrival the devil began to rage against him 
through a possessed virgin into whom the devil had entered. She| 
had cursed and blasphemed horribly in her fits, but knew nothing 
more about it when she came to herself again.

Brenz reports that he has received his (Brenz's) interpretation 
of the prophet Amos, but rejects the praise given to him by Luthe 
in the pretace (St. Louis edition, vol. XIV, 166) as undeserved. By 
not accepting the means of comparison granted by the 
evangelicals, the adversaries at the Diet of Augsburg revealed 
themselves as people like Pharaoh and as antichrists.

they are antichrists who forbid the doctrine of godliness

and revealed at the Diet of Augsburg, of which you will 
certainly not say that it is "nothing". For he whom the Holy 
Scriptures describe as the Antichrist in so many words, 
in so many sentences, in so many chapters, in so many

exhorted the people to godliness, saying constantly that believers 
will attain these unspeakably great goods. But lest it should be}

he loved particularly and from whose number he wished to take 
one as his wife. Finally, Hesse complained about his income, 
which had been reduced by a malicious person.

To D. Martin Luther, his most revered father. 

Hail in Christ Jesus! The letters which this 
messenger brings to you, most reverend Father in 
Christ, | requested from your friends, since | wanted 
to leave here, and would have delivered them myself, 
if the rainy weather had not deterred me. Therefore, | 
will stay here until the weather improves. It is said that 
the Emperor will leave Augsburg tomorrow; 1) he is 
very upset about the steadfastness of the 
Augsburgers, who did not want to sign the extremely 
ungodly decree; therefore, the poor citizens are in 
danger in many ways, both from the enraged Emperor 
and from the people (if they agree with the Emperor's 
opinion). There are certain rumors about the election 
of Ferdinand; the coronation is scheduled for Aachen, 
and the emperor will put it into effect in the first place. 
2) | have no doubt, however, that if these rumors 
continue, a certain doom will befall our Germany. For 
not only the fate of Ferdinand, but also that terrible 
flood by which a good part of Lower Germany 
perished, has given a certain indication of very great 
misfortunes. About this matter, | am sending you a 
printed note. 3) 

A letter sent by the Elector to our council has 
brought a new cause for dispute, in which he 
admonishes our people to prepare themselves to 
drive back the unjust power of the emperor. For this 
opinion had been approved by his councilors and 
doctors (he did not add anything about the 
theologians). Jns 


1) The emperor left Augsburg on Nov. 23.

This was secretly entrusted to me by Spengler, and 
he himself may have written to you about this matter. 
Our people are not very moved by this strange thing, 
especially those who are more intelligent. For they 
suspect Albrecht 4) of whom it is said that he has all 
the advice in common with Macedonia 5). | must not 
say more about this. My dear father, make sure that 
through your prayers the extremely sad evils that we 
fear are either completely averted or at least 
alleviated. Our sins do not allow us to expect anything 
milder. But there may be five righteous ones in the 
holy Church of God, by whose supplications and tears 
we may be preserved, amen. Fare well in Christ with 
your wife Catharina and the children and the whole 
household. 

My cause has not yet reached the goal | desired. ° 
Partly the threatening horrors and dangers stand in 
my way, partly the stupidity of my mind. Brenz in Hall 
has taken a widow as his wife and celebrated the 
wedding without pomp. 

Billicanus, 7) the Nérdlinger, has asked Cardinal 
Campegius for dispensation from the ordination of 
priests and from the office of preacher, and now walks 
around splendidly dressed and engages_ in 
merchandising. Also a good part of the priests, who 
followed his reputation in Nérdlingen, have returned 
to the old benefices and defend the pope stubbornly 
and perform papist official acts. 

The council of Reutlingen has recently written a 
letter to our council which testifies to an extremely 
great confidence in faith: they would follow the word 
even in the most extreme dangers; it makes no 
difference whether they are destroyed by the enemies 
of the word or whether they are delivered, and death 
and life are in the hand of the Lord 2c. | will see to it 
that | bring a copy of this letter with me, for as soon 
as the weather improves | will return. Now farewell,

But since all of you there are so insistent that he should go

About the Imperial Diet this is the certain opinion,” that 
the emperor commands par excellence that everything 
should be restored as it was before, and the empire of the 
pope must exist, and more firmly than before. This 
harshness will produce a movement in the empire (as | 
fear), to the ruin of the bishops and the clergy. For the 
more powerful cities, namely Nuremberg, Ulm, Augsburg, 
Strasbourg, Frankfort, with twelve others, publicly reject 
the Emperor's decree and do not want to carry it out, and, 
together with our princes, are constantly and bravely 
clinging to the word. It is also said, indeed it is certain, that 
Ferdinand should be elected Roman king, namely so that, 
having lost his kingdoms, he may still have one left to add 
to those he has lost, "and at last the misfortune of our 
country may be complete. | believe that you have heard 
about the flood in Rome, then also about the other one in 
Brabant and Flanders, both of which were extremely 
terrible. God shows great and many signs, but the wicked 
do not care about them. | believe that you have also heard 
of the vision of the Speier monks 5). But now, recently, 
another ghost has been seen near Baden, namely an army 
on foot in the air, and at its side a distinguished® soldier 
who carries a spear.

addressed to the emperor. The essential content is this: Before St. 
Jacob's Day ay 25, 1530) two fishermen, who were busy with 
their work at Speier, were forced by a very large number of monks 
from all kinds of orders to put them across the Rhine. "The monks

To the honorable and wise mayors and council of 
Géttingen, my favorable lords and friends. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear 
gentlemen and friends! Here comes a preacher, whom | 
recently announced to Your Worship, by the name of M. 
Johannes Birnstiel. ') And although he will not be entirely 
of Saxon language, | hope that he will be well heard, 
because preachers of Upper Saxon language are also 
pleasant in Brunswick. The other, Licentiate Basilius, 2) 
will soon follow; for he cannot sell his farmland and 
livestock in such a hurry, therefore he must also move, 
3) and is difficult to raise. It will become thin here with 
pastors. The harvest is great, and the workers few; that 
is why they are being kept. | hope, however, that Ew. W. 
will have two learned, skilful men in them; so he Basilius 
knows both Saxon and Oberlandish well. Order them 
herewith to Ew. W. in all confidence. | also ask that you 
reimburse them for food on the way; 4) in the meantime, 
| have asked them to borrow. God grant that they may 
produce great fruit among you all, to the praise and glory 
of God and to the blessedness of you all, amen. At 
Wittenberg, January 11, 1531.

Wittenberg. January 11, 1531. 


To Johann Sutel, pastor in Gottingen. 


Luther writes because of the same preachers and exhorts to 
unanimity in doctrine and toleration in regard to the 
Ceremonies. 


1) Birnstiel became pastor at St. Mary's Church, but remained 
in Géttingen only until July 27, probably because of his "High 
Franconian language"; "he called out very loudly, soon he spoke 
lower, so that one could not hear [that is, understand] it too loudly. 
He was assessor of the consistory at Coburg in 1542 and died in 
1559. 

2) Basilius Schumann; he did not come to Gdttingen. Cf. the 
letter to the council of Géttingen of March 1. 

3) "must" only with Tolle. 

4) Birnstiel received for himself and his wife in travel money 
January 29, 24-1/2 fl. 16-1/2 B. and 31 Mk. 8 B. On July 27, he 
received a parting gift of 1-1/2 Mk. 8B. 

5) The signature only at Tolle.

To the highly esteemed man, Magister Johann 
Sutel,® the faithful servant of God in Géttingen, his 
brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ JEsu! Behold, there comes 
ne of the preachers, dear brother, whom | promised 
efore, named Johann Birnstiel; the other will also follow 
In a short time. For he is hindered by his farming, with 
hich he has fed himself until now. He could only be taken 
way from the place with great difficulty, and until he sells 
is things, he will only be able to get away slowly. But | 
sk you and all of you to carry on the cause of Christ with 
ne accord, and not to raise any questions in the 
eremonies that do not violate the faith. For you know that 
he rough rabble easily seizes an opportunity to despise 
he word. And even though ceremonies are not necessary 
or salvation, some of them are useful to the common 
eople, so that their dull minds are moved. But | speak 
specially of the ceremonies of the masses, as there are 
he altars, vestments, lights and such minor things; if these 
re not done away with, they can be retained, as we do 
ere in Wittenberg. But if they are removed, | would like to 
ee them gradually reintroduced, but in such a way that 
he 
Word governs, through which we can make consciences 
firm. For they benefit the children and the simple; they 
must be served. But the bond of perfection, love, must 
reign here and peace must triumph: 


6) Sutel, born in 1504 at Altenmorsch near Melsungen in Hesse, 
studied in Erfurt, became Rector in Melsungen, came to 
Géttingen in 1530 on the recommendation of the preacher Jost 
Winter von Allendorf, who had been lent to Géttingen by the 
Landgrave of Hesse, as a preacher at the Nicolai Church, later 
at the Johanniskirche. In September 1535 he became 
superintendent. In 1542 he was called to Schweinfurt, whose 
reformer he became; returned to Gdttingen because of the 
Schmalkaldic War at the beginning of 1547, where he works as 
a predicant for 21 months, but is already found as pastor in 
Allendorf at Easter of that year. Called back to Géttingen again 
in 1548, he became pastor of St. Albani's Church and in 1555 
superintendent at Nordheim, where he died in August 1575.

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, careful, dear 
Lord and friend! Laurentius Strauch, who now has one 
of the small scholarships from the honorable council of 
Nuremberg, asks me to ask for him whether he would 
like to receive the larger one, which is now to be given 
away at Easter. However, since your person must 
otherwise leak all the puddles, | have good faith in you 
to pour these things out as well; | kindly ask you to 
represent my person, and, where it is to be done, to be 
helpful and supportive to the aforementioned shrub for 
such a scholarship, as you know how to do or not to do.

Your esteemed husband, Mr. Wenceslaus Link, the 
faithful servant of Christ at Nuremberg, his 
superior. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have received two letters 
from you, my dear Wenceslaus, which announce news. 
But | have nothing new to repay you, except this evil news 
that in Friesland the false doctrine of the Sacramentirans 
reigns free. And the count, 1) who has so far bravely 
resisted, now, broken, allows that everything and 
anything is taught by everyone. It seems to me that God 
has begun to punish the ingratitude of the world, and that 
he will again [repay] 2) and let the ungrateful go astray. 
But he will have mercy on us, amen. 

That you recently asked whether it was true that we 
had advised that one should resist the emperor, as you 
indicated was written to you, - we have indeed not advised 
this in any way. But since there were some who said 
publicly that one should not ask the theologians about 
this, or take care of them, but the jurists, who said that this 
was permitted, | said for my part: | advise as a theologian; 
but if the jurists could teach according to their laws that it 
is permitted, then | would allow them to use their laws; let 
them watch. For if the emperor has decreed in his laws 
that it is permissible in this case for him to be resisted, let 
him suffer the law he has given; only | do not want to 
advise or pass judgment on this very law, but want to 
remain in my theology. 

| readily conceded that it is true that a prince as a 
prince is a worldly person, and by acting so, does not act 
as a Christian who is neither a prince, 


1) Count Enno of Friesland, while remaining faithful to the 
Lutheran doctrine himself, tired of the opposition he found from all 
sides, gave free rein to the further development of Zwinglianism. 

2) We have sought to fill the gap by reddere. 


1618 


nor a man, nor anything that there is in the world of 
persons. Therefore, if a prince, being a prince, is free to 
resist the emperor, let that be left to the judgment and 
conscience of those. The Christian is certainly not free to 
do anything, since he has died to the world. So much has 
been done in this, and so much you can tell Mr. Lazarus 
about my opinion, although | see that, even if we cried out 
against it with all our might, they still have their minds so 
fixed that they want to resist, and do not want to be made 
to give way, as | preach in vain that God will help us, so 
that it is not necessary to resist; as indeed He does, since 
He has destroyed this Diet in such a way that they have 
done nothing to this day. God would do the same from 
now on. But faith is not everyone's thing. But | console 
myself with the fact that, if they absolutely do not accept 
our advice, they sin less or act more surely when they act 
according to civil law than when they act completely 
against conscience and with a determined will against the 
Scriptures. Meanwhile, they believe they are not acting 
contrary to Scripture if they are not acting contrary to civil 
law. "So | let them do," | am free. 

Greetings to Mr. Spengler and your friends. The 
illness of the head, which | contracted in Coburg through 
the old wine, has not yet been conquered by the 
Wittenberg beer. Therefore, | work little, forced to allow 
the head its days of rest, a burdensome leisure for me 
and a very unpleasant one for the printers. | am finishing 
the explanations - - - - 1)We are correcting the Psalter 
again and for the last time, because there were no copies 
left. We will try our best, not that David is better than the 
others. 


1) Here is a larger gap, which we are not able to fill, since we 
cannot determine which commentaries Luther means, since he 
did not publish any interpretations of biblical writings in 1531. It is 
possible that Luther called his "Glosse auf das vermeinte 
kaiserliche Edict" (St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 1665) so (as the Erl. 
Briefw. conjicirt), because already on February 3, Spengler was 
"eagerly awaiting Luther's translation of the Psalter, also his 
Bichlein de Comitiis".

To Johann Weber, Superintendent at Neustadt an 
der Orla. 


About a divorce. 


The original is in Wittenberg in the Rathsarchiv. Printed by 
Schitze, Vol. Il, p. 212; by De Wette, Vol. 1 V, p. 214; by Theoph. 
Stier, Inclutae Academiae Jenensi. . . gratulatur etc., p. 9; in 
Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 38 and in Erl. Briefw., vol. VIII, p. 347. 


To the highly esteemed brother in Christ, Johann 
Weber, servant of the Word in Neustadt and faithful 
and loud superintendent. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! | have, dear man, 
advised Johann Nicolai 4) in his marriage case that he 
should do so: First, he should summon her to court 
according to divine example, that is, by posted notices on 
the doors of the churches in the neighboring towns, by 
which she would be admonished and summoned to 
answer within a month, or as it may be, either to you or to 
him, why she had run away, left her husband, broken 
faith, and committed robbery and theft. 


2) The sense here is easy to determine: "your wife and your 
children"; on the other hand, we have not succeeded in finding a 
suitable word complement to the words that follow here: "carnis - 
- bonae". 

3) According to De Wette, the original should have MDXXX by 
mistake. Such an oversight would have been possible, but don't 
the Roman numerals make the original suspicious, since Luther, 
as far as | can see, also in his Latin letters always uses the 
German numerals? (Erl. Briefw.) 

4) Joh. Nicolai, pastor in Dreitzsch near Neustadt, was 
engaged to a widow Eva Erbes from Mellerstadt in Franconia in 
the spring of 1527 and married her in Schweinitz. In October 1530 
the woman escaped. Her whereabouts near Wurzburg were 
traced. She did not appear after several citations, so in October 
1531 the divorce was granted by the court, and Nicolai was 
allowed to marry again.

2c. If she should not come, the same notes may threaten 
her, she will be condemned and separated by divorce, 
and the man will be given permission to marry another 
2c. When this is done, let the whole matter be proclaimed 
by you and others in a sermon to the people. And after 
that one is condemned and released by divorce, you may 
proclaim that John is free to take another, as he himself 
will tell in more detail. The annoyance of Satau must be 
countered with public testimony and work. Fare well in 
the Lord and pray for me. January 16, 1531.

To Nicolaus Hausmann in Zwickau. 


Some news. Of a parish post for Bernhard von Délen and of 
the new display of the Psalter. 


The original can be found in the Anhaltisches Gesammtarchiv, 
Hausmannbriefe, No. 67 (with the inscription Hausmanns: "Hr. 
Bnhardt Dolen"). Handwritten at Zerbst in the Frranciscaneum,

in Walch, vol. XXI, 1377. 


The man to be highly honored in the Lord, Mr. Nicolaus 
Hausmann, the extremely faithful bishop of the 
church at Zwickau, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! It would not have been 
necessary for me to write to you, my dear Nicolaus, since 
our Jonas, a living letter, went to you, from whom you can 
learn everything that is going on both with us and is 
reported from elsewhere here. The Sacramentarians are 
eagerly seeking our fellowship and in part are departing 
from their opinion and speaking more softly. Let us pray 
that it will be a perfect and pure harmony. Johann 
Pommer works bravely, but Satan resists him and has 
challenged him through a possessed girl; Jonas will give 
an ample and, as he is a Demosthenes, excellent 
account of all these things. 


| wonder why Bernhard has not returned long ago. | 
ask you, if you can reach him by letters, may you order 
him to return. For the parish under Sebastian Kétteritz 
near Leisnig is waiting for him, where | hope he can stay 
comfortably. But if not, | will see to it that he is provided 
elsewhere. "Tell him that he cannot eat me poor in three 
or four weeks." Tell me this, | beg of you. 

We are now reissuing the German Psalter to provoke 
the slanderers. But Christ, who has begun his work, will 
also accomplish it for his glory and our benefit. My 
mistress Kathe and the family and the whole house greet 
you respectfully. January 21, 1531. 

From the heart, your Martin Luther. 

Greetings from me to the Mihlpfort and all ours.

| thought it was still too early, because the matter was still 
so new; but because (praise God) now the cupping 1) has 
changed a little, | now want to hold your writing up to you 
again, so that you now also both help your lords and other 
friends, so that (if it pleases God) peace and unity may 
be preserved. For you know too well that love should be 
above all things and have the precedence, except for 
God, who is above all things, including love. Wherever he 
and his word prevail, love should certainly have the upper 
hand with us, next to God. Such a noble cause should not 
be attacked with our attempts or devotion, but with 
heartfelt prayer and spiritual sighing; for it is God's cause, 
not ours. God must do with it and to it, our doing is not.

To the great defender of pure Christianity, D. Martin

Lord with my brothers and colleagues, who has granted 
that our confession 2) is sufficient for you even so far. 
You are surprised that | have made Zwingli and 
Oecolampad a part of this opinion or exposition. You 
would not be surprised if you had examined what they, 
especially Oecolampadius, have discussed with me 
about this matter according to my judgment, not to 
mention the scriptures. But you want to talk with me, and 
wonder again, since we confess that Christ's body is truly 
present here in the Lord's Supper and is offered through 
the words and sacraments, but for food of the soul, not of 
the belly, as these words "Take, eat" 2c. teach (for this is 
how our confession has it), why it troubles us to further 
confess that Christ's body is also offered with the bread 
by heart to the mouths of both the godly and the godless. 
But this, most esteemed Luther, does not complain us, 
nor have | added the word "for the food of the soul" not 
because | do not believe that the body of Christ can be 
present and presented in several things 3) at the same 
time, but because | wanted to satisfy those who wrongly 
think that you make the natural body of Christ the food of 
the body, which you deny in explicit words in your 
confession” in the Torment Sij. For these are your words 
from word to word: "So from now on it is rightly said, 
whoever attacks this bread attacks Christ's body, and 
whoever eats this bread eats Christ's body, whoever 
crushes this bread with teeth or tongue crushes Christ's 
body with teeth or tongue; and yet it remains true 
throughout that no one sees, grasps, eats or bites Christ's 
body, as one visibly sees and bites other flesh. For what 
is done to the bread is rightly and properly appropriated 
to the body of Christ for the sake of sacramental unity." 
In that you write, "For that which is done to bread," 2c., 
you recognize that it is taken with the hand, bitten with 
the teeth, and thus transferred to the stomach, digested, 
and that which otherwise belongs to natural food, all this 
is actually done to the bread, but it is added to the body 
of Christ for the sake of sacramental unity, and therefore 
it is not actually done.

Therefore, in the Lord's Supper, Christ's body is 
not given for the food of the belly, but of the soul, for 
food for the latter, not for the former, is sought here. 
And since we confess that Christ's body is presented 
through the words and sacraments, we certainly 
acknowledge that it is present with the bread, and 
therefore, for the sake of sacramental unity, it is also 
presented to the mouth, both of the ungodly and the 
godly. But the ungodly, as you write, 1) do not receive 
it, as the blind do not receive the light of the sun, 
though it strikes their eyes as well as those of the 
seeing. Yes, we confess that those who know that the 
body of the Lord is offered here also receive it, 
although their soul receives corruption from it, is not 
fed. For these do not relate to it as the blind do to the 
light of the sun, after they have received the words of 
the Lord. Of those who have absolutely nothing of 
faith, and think nothing else of this bread than of any 
other bread, | do not see how they differ from the mice 
that gnaw this bread. And since Christ has instituted 
this sanctuary [or sacrament] for his disciples, | do not 
know at all what | should ascribe to such people who 
know nothing of Christ. But | would rather say: They 
are none of our business who are outside, than 
quarrel with any Christian, let alone with you or any 
other preacher of Christ about these things. Since we 
hold and teach thus, for we never speak of this 
sacrament without expressly expressing our 
abhorrence of those who seek nothing but bread and 
wine, and not at the same time also the body and 
blood of the Lord, and that primarily, in the Lord's 
Supper, we hold that nothing of falsehood or 
blasphemy is committed when either ours take the 
Lord's Supper with you, or yours with us. On both 
sides the words of the Lord are presented in the best 
faith, simple faith in them is taught, the eating of Christ 
is recommended above all things. And even if some 
should misunderstand this, since the gifts of God do 
not depend on the faith or the merit of the church 
minister, or even on that of the communicants, those 
who receive Christ's promise with faith as well as with 
their ears can be sure that they will receive it. 


1) In the letter of Jan. 22, St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 1973. 
2) In the original it is not clear whether sacrum or sacramentum 
is to be read, sacru or sacram. 





They will not be deceived in their hope, and as much 
as they believe, as Leo says, so much they will 
receive. But the more | consider how it is now with the 
judgments of the people, the more | approve of your 
counsel that we gradually strengthen the doctrine of 
the true presence and eating of Christ in the Lord's 
Supper, in the churches where any possibility will 
present itself, but that you take care to nourish these 
beginnings of concord, which you freely offer, by 
kindness, and to promote them by prayers to Christ, 
since as yet no writing has gone out to the public 
concerning our concord. Certainly, | would have 
written our confession much shorter, and, if | am not 
mistaken, more completely to your satisfaction, if | 
had not feared the wrong judgments of many, and the 
annoyance of very many. Therefore, to please them, 
| have added the things by which | have expressed 
the truth of the human body in Christ, and that it is in 
heaven, not spatially in the bread, nor is it naturally 
mixed with the bread,°) which | do not see to be 
contrary to your faith. For since among the wise men 
according to whom Christ's body is present both in 
heaven and in the Lord's Supper, you also list these:” 
"that he may sit in the midst of all creatures, in a 
certain place, and when a certain place or part of 
creatures is presented, as when bread and wine are 
presented by the word of God, then it may be said, 
Behold! there is Christ's body truly in the bread, as 
one may say when a certain part of a crystal is placed 
before one's eyes, in the midst of which is a little spark 
or flame: Behold! here in the foremost and in the 
rearmost part of the crystal is the little spark," you 
certainly do not suppose that Christ's body is 
localized in heaven, nor do you assert that it is 
localized in the bread: therefore, since we confess 
with the Fathers, for the sake of the true manner of a 
body, that Christ is in some place of heaven, and yet 
at the same time is truly present in the Sacrament, | 
cannot see what difference there is between us in the 
matter itself. 

For | do not doubt that you will gladly give up those 
things for which you do not stand to fight, so that you 
may obtain those for which conscience does not 
permit you to fight. But we can easily see that these 
disgusting things, as with our churches there is rest, 
so with yours there is unrest.

| therefore suffer with the greatest equanimity that my 
writing about our union be erased, and according to 
your advice you also gave at Coburg, we strive on 
both sides to promote these beginnings of peace, on 
the word which | sent before. As for Oecolampad and 
many ministers of other churches, and not even a few 
churches, you may not doubt that the real (solida) 
presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper will also be 
taught with the signs (symbolis). Zwingli, in my 
opinion, still fears too much that a natural eating of 
Christ, as a perishable food of the belly, imposes 
itself on the people, to the detriment of the faith in the 
truthfulness of a human body in Christ. But he could 
have suffered that my confession, the one | sent, 
would be published, so there was good hope, and still 
is, that from these beginnings a step would be taken 
toward firm unity. Let us diligently ask Christ to bring 
it about, and let us in all things put before one another 
that which is conducive to peace. | have long since 
acquitted you of all obstinacy in your mind, my dear 
teacher; | know that Christ's honor, not yours, fills you 
with anxiety here and in other things. And | do not 
doubt that you will duly consider how much this 
discord has hindered the course of the Gospel, 
although 1) in truth we do not recognize ourselves as 
the people whose fellowship you greatly need, except 
insofar as it helps the saints that each one should join 
Christ's army. Trust in Christ, for whose glory all 
things will finally come to pass. But | beg you, for the 
sake of Christ, not to be stubborn about what is 
written on this side: as you, when you had your mind 
fixed on these words: "Take, eat, this is my body" 2c., 
and even now cannot hold otherwise than that here 
the body of the Lord Himself is given in the bread, is 
also to be taken with the mouth, and is given to all 
who eat this bread of the Lord, so those, seeing their 
minds immovably fixed on the sayings describing 
Christ as true man, were afraid to say that this saying, 
"this bread is my body," was a simple one 
(simplicem), and that "is" was taken in it essentially 
(noun). For they saw that you do not deny that the 
bread cannot be what the body of the Lord is. From 
this are after, 


1) Instead of et si we read efsi. 


When the disputation had become heated, almost a 
thousand disputes arose, of which | could always 
have sworn that they consisted only in words. But to 
finally put an end to this letter, | want to remind you of 
the one thing that my conscience believes, that these 
words of the Lord: "Take" 2c. demand that we believe 
that the body of the Lord is truly offered with the 
bread. But what | have written to M. Philip about the 
ungodly, which | deliberately did not want to 
remember, | would like you to receive in such a way 
that you understand that it seems to me, since those 
words were spoken to the disciples, that by them it is 
not required that we also discuss this matter with 
those who, in all likelinood, do not want to be Christ's 
disciples, not that | ascribe the presence of Christ to 
the soul in such a way as to make him absent from 
the signs in the meantime, since | nevertheless say 
that he is received and presented presently through 
the signs, adding only that all this is instituted for the 
nourishment of the soul, not of the body, except 
insofar as the power of immortality flows over to the 
latter from the soul. In this you have my opinion in 
abundance in this matter, which is diligently taught in 
our church and in very many others, and it is good 
hope that we will finally also all have the same opinion 
here, toward which we will work diligently. Fare well in 
Christ, and receive me, as you have again begun, as 
a father. At Strasbourg, February 9, 2.

Grace and peace in the Lord! It is true, my dear Justus, 
what you have heard, that Bucer has at least begun to 
have the same opinion with us about the Lord's Supper, 
if the letters he addressed to me and Philip are not 
deceptive (which | do not easily believe). By the way, it is 
still uncertain whether the others also want the same 
thing; Bucer works and works towards the fact that they 
want the same thing, and has done so much that all admit 
that the body of the Lord is truly present in the Lord's 
Supper and is served, even in bodily presence. But the 
others say that it is only presented and present as food 
to a believing and godly soul; but Bucer agrees. 

1) This letter presupposes that Luther had already received 


Bucer's letter No. 1759, therefore Seidemann's dating in De

that it is also presented by the hand of the ungodly and 
taken with the mouth. For his letters clearly testify to this.

my grandfather's 2). | am overwhelmed with letters from

them thinks that his business alone is the one that the idle 
Luther should carry out. Then almost all the messengers 
can't wait, don't have food, and have other things to do, 
so that they expect the letters to be ready for them as 
soon as they have delivered theirs. 

You may say this to George,*) to Thomas and to my 
grandfather; in time | will answer them, and will help. "I 
will not" as one "arrange" all the business of all and alone

4) This letter is incorrectly dated in the editions: Mense Junio 
Anno 1528, because the Reformation did not begin in Géttingen 
until October 1529, and the church order mentioned at the 
beginning of this letter was not printed in Wittenberg until 1531. 
Luther sent the same on March I, 1531 (as the following letter 
shows) to the council and no doubt on the same day also to the 
preachers with this letter. However, if this letter (which seems 
credible to us according to No. 1767) is Luther's preface to the 
church order itself, then a somewhat earlier date would have to 
be set. 


1630 


To the worthy pastors and preachers of the city of 
Gottingen Mart. Luth. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have read over your 
desire for this church order of yours and promoted it 
through printing; God, the Father of all wisdom, grant His 
grace that it may gain a strong continuation, amen. 

For we know well, praise God, what an adversary we 
have in such matters, namely Satan with all his angels: 
therefore it is not enough to have good order, good law, 
good doctrine; indeed, there is (in short) no counsel, no 
wisdom, no precept so good and right, that anything 
should be built on it and anything should be attempted; 
indeed, even if it is a divine right, it is not useful, but rather 
harmful, Rom. 4:15: "The law provokes wrath." 

How many a wise man, yes, how many a holy man 
has missed his most beautiful and best cause and his 
most sacred right. Why is that? Because there is one 
more thing that belongs to right and good order, that is, 
to prosper, so that St. Paul himself says that the gospel 
(which is not only God's order, but also God's power) 
does not create anything if God does not prosper it [1 
Cor. 3:7]. 

Therefore these are foolish men, which say, | have a 
good right, | will do it; who shall forbid me? For that they 
say, | am well justified, is well said; but that they also say, 
| will do it, is too much. For such doing is not yours, as 
little as the right is yours. God must help it to be done; 
otherwise you will see if it is not done for you. 

Even if you are right, God will not suffer your defiance 
and insistence on justice; You should also humbly ask for 
help, so that he, and not you yourself, may preserve 
justice, so that you may learn what the devil is, yes, what 
you yourself are, as you are not able, if he has you right, 
and the devil is a warrior against everything that is right 
and good, that God must help you, not only from injustice, 
but also to justice, both in great and small, yes, all kinds 
of things. Therefore wisdom says, Proverbs 8:14: "Mine 
is counsel and advice. Many have good counsel, but 


Letters from the year 1531. no. 1765. 1766. 


1631 


The device does not follow, but becomes a great evil out 
of great counsel, as many examples and histories prove. 
Therefore, dear lords and friends, | have informed you 
that you should keep yourselves and your people in 
mind, not only to rely on your church order, as if there 
were no need for it now that it has been established, but 
also to give humble thanks to God and ask Him to grant 
you prosperity and guidance, and to go on blessedly. 

For there will be enough obstacles and hindrances; 
and he who is a prince in the world (believe me) will also 
want to be a prince in Gdttingen, and will not like to be a 
beggar. 

God cast him under you, as St. Paul asks Rom. 16, 
20: God tread Satan under your feet. Which | also wish 
for you, and pray that God will bless you and keep you, 
and make you grow blameless and strong for His praise 
and glory, Amen. [March 1, 1531. 1)

To Johann Titel, pastor in Gottingen. 


Luther reports that the church order of the city of Géttingen 
had been printed in Wittenberg and that he had provided it with 
a preface to the preachers (probably No. 1765). Luther complains 
about the meagerness of the Géttingen against the preachers to 
be hired. Answer to the question: whether Sutel could administer 
Holy Communion without having been anointed.

Grace and peace in the Lord! We have taken care of 
the printing of your [church] order, my dear Sutel, which 
| have provided, as best | could, with a preface dedicated 
to you preachers. 1) You may see whether it will be of 
any use. | see that the sings find themselves complained 
if they have to pay the church servants a little more, 2) 
also take no account of the time. Perhaps they hope they 
may have superfluous people to administer the 
preaching office, but since they hoped this, church 
servants should not have been sought from me. For here 
there is the greatest shortage of suitable men, and | can 
only drive them out with great difficulty, so that we are 
beginning to suffer mailgel in this city as well. In the past 
they wasted thousands of florins on innumerable 
seducers, while

"The salary promised to Schumann satisfied Luther (cf. to 
Gericke March 28), so the rebuke concerns the objection to the 
moving expenses." The letter to Gericke rather shows that the 
latter was immediately offered 10 guilders more than the 
licentiate Basilius. 


they do not want to turn to one hundred now. Therefore, 
we will let them go. It is better that they should be the 
servants of the pope and subject to the devil, than that 
they should be lords over Christ and trample on his word. 
Many such things occur in other places, but the Lord 
knows His own [2 Tim. 2:19]. "They make themselves 
believe that we must be glad of them, and that without 
them we cannot remain anywhere." This is not seeking 
the gospel with earnestness. Therefore | cannot answer 
anything about what you ask: whether you should partake 
of the Lord's Supper unshorn and unanointed, 3). For if it 
should not be a serious matter there, then | would like you 
to abstain from it, as before; but if it should be a serious 
matter, then you can receive testimony publicly before 
the altar from the other church ministers with a speech 
and the laying on of hands, and the power to administer 
the Lord's Supper. But excuse my brevity. | am moved by 
so many examples of ingratitude, that | am brought to 
give myself severely to these things, and to make myself

with the manna [Deut. 21:5]. You are well, brave in Christ.

To the Elector John of Saxony. 


Luther asks him, on the basis of the expulsion of Soranus, to 
resist the arbitrary procedure of the council of Zwickau. . 


Handwritten in the Rathsarchiv at Zwickau (simultaneous, very 
poorly written copy). Printed by Kolde, p. 167 and in Erl. Briefw., 
vol. VIII, p. 372. 

Most gracious Lord! The City Council of Zwickau has 
suspended their preacher, Mr. Lorenz Soran, which is 
both burdensome to the pastor and preacher, because 
they have done so without the will of the pastor, even 
without cause against the preacher. Now, the Elector 
General knows very well where the example should be 
set that a preacher should be appointed and dismissed 
against the pastor, if they want to appoint 1) a Miinzer or 
Carlstadt today or tomorrow, depending on whether they 
are inclined or disinclined toward the pastor. In addition, 
the Electorate is not to suffer, because now all 
monasteries and offices are in the hands of the 
Electorate, due to necessity and the  bishops' 
abandonment of the idea that a city should be subject to 
having monasteries and offices for itself as its own. 


1) "they" put by us instead of: "themselves". 





thum. Also, where it should apply that a city may depose 
preachers and pastors if it wishes, and, the most serious, 
to burden an unindicted and unconvinced 2) preacher 
with such punishments that he is driven out in disgrace 
and cast into misery, the Elector General will not keep 
preachers in the country. The punishment should not be 
carried out*) before the guilt is proven and the cause is 
brought forward. Therefore, to prevent such a bad 
example, | humbly request that your Lordship have a 
serious understanding, because the city of Zwickau has 
acry that they can not stand a preacher,” and very hard- 
headed (hartt koppick), nevertheless want to be 
evangelical, to little honor of the Gospel. Further, the 
pastor himself will report to E. churf. G.. Hereby 
commanded by God, Amen. Marcii 4, 1531.

To the respectable, highly respected and worthy 
Mr. Martin Luther, holy and evangelical scripture 
doctor, our special favorable gentleman and 
friend. 

Our very willing services of possible diligence 
before. Respectable, worthy, dear Doctor! We have 
now received E. A.'s letter at Torgau concerning the 
leave of absence of Mr. Lorenzen, the preacher at St. 
Catherine's; however, because we are burdened with 
letters at*) , we have not been able to give E. A. a 
correct and proper answer as we would have liked. 
However, we are not a little concerned and alienated 
by your letter, and we have no doubt that E. A. will 
report to us, along with all the circumstances, that you 
have spared us your almost vanishing letter, because 
we, through divine help and grace, would also like to 
live and act in a way that is pleasing to God, that will 
make us blessed, and that will not be punishable by 
the world. We must, however, tolerate this and other 
letters, which are addressed to us and against us, in 
view of the fact that we are innocent of the dishonor 
inflicted upon us; 5) under the name of the holy word 
of God, and the holy gospel is to be called preached; 
but if we would have our regiment discharged, it 
should not be highly contrary to us to hand it over to 
the pastors and preachers, as is their intention. © At 
our discretion, our business shall, as we request and 
ask, be brought to trial: 7) it shall apparently be found 
that we are justified in such dismissal. Be that as it 
may, we want to send E. A.'s letter to other friends of 
ours as well. Whether E. A. needs to write further, our 
excuse shall also remain undisturbed. For we are 
willing and eager to serve E. A. and his dignity, as our 
favorable lord. Dated Wednesday after Reminiscere

than to live with them, since while they live, they do not

lack nothing, but those will perish completely. Be well 
and pray to the Lord for me; in him be well and live.

If you want to take it around, we leave the matter to 
God. But you may see what you will achieve with this 
decision with the enemies of the Gospel, or what you 
will bring my Zwickauer to. The church goods are 
dealt with in such a way that the council is not 
ashamed to give an account of every penny at any 
moment. They do not seize the goods of the church 
and take them as robbery, as they are also falsely 
accused by those who are concerned that they 
defend their conscience. Why do you hear the 
bringers in this piece? And in short, in all these things 
the council will prove its innocence. Believe me, the 
council is holier and more innocent in this matter than 
that it should remain silent and allow itself to be 
accused of this disgrace. This is what | recently 
wanted to say in reply to your vehement letter, so that 
you may see that we are not at all afraid of these 
accusers, but are courageous and steadfast, and give 
an account of all our words and deeds, not only to 
you, venerable father, but also to our prince, and to 
anyone else who is interested, when and as often as 
it is necessary. Therefore, for the sake of Christ and 
Christian peace, | ask you to hold back your hasty 
judgment, even to withdraw it, until you have also 
heard us or read our apology. There will be little lack, 
as | believe, that you should not regret having so 
hastily condemned us poor, unheard, innocent 
people. It is also not without cause that Soranus has 
been dismissed without prior knowledge and inquiry 
with our pastor - as you will also hear in due time. We 
may therefore not be out of the fellowship of Jesus 
Christ, as you judge, since you are wrongly 
prejudiced by the other part. Rather, we are driven by 
the holiest zeal, and that by virtue of our knowledge 
and the gospel of Christ. If you will not deny this, that 
even among those who boast of the gospel, ungodly 
men are sometimes found, who, under the pretext of 
the gospel, follow their affections more, and interfere 
with their preaching with such great bitterness, 
immodesty and impetuosity, that nothing is above it, 
than doing the work of Christ. There is hardly a 
sermon in which one does not hear: you sticks, you 
blocks, you rogues, you rogue necks, you knuckle-

people, | have to call you whales," | have to reel you

By the way, what you write about Erhard Goetz, you

that your council is spreading this fairy tale to your and all

the matrimonial matters, which the authorities have not

words, that | was playing a game with dissolving and 
confirming the marriage according to my will, and

judgment of ours, "let them judge for themselves and rule}

To the esteemed man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, the faithful 
and fair pastor of the church at Altenburg, his 
exceedingly dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! This Georg Tors 1) has 
been with me, my best Spalatin, in the intention of finding 
some position. Since none presented itself at present, 
and he could not stay here in this place, he has decided 
to stay outside of Wittenberg for the time being, 
somewhere where an opportunity should always present 
itself, until a position is offered to him. Therefore, he asks 
me for letters of recommendation to you and the other 
visitators, if you could advise him with any position. 
Therefore, either help the man or comfort him with a word 
that inspires confidence. 

We have no news, except that the theurization of 
grain has suddenly risen beyond all measure, and there 
is a tremendous clamor among the people. But what does 
the unbelievable neglect of the word not deserve, rather 
the contempt and hatred even among our people? God 
convert our hearts, and so have mercy on us, Amen.

is the same where enraged spouses depart from each 
other. But a divorce, that both may marry, is not to be 
made, except in the public court, where each of the two 
parties is personally accused and charged. It is not up to 
us to advise this, nor does it fall within the bounds of 
conscience. Conscience, however, is safe if he abstains 
from the presence of the woman as long as he is in 
probable fear of such great danger. Now whether this 
fear is probable must be determined from the man's 
manners, character, and reputation, as when he is not 
notorious for levity or malice, but has a good reputation 
and serious manners; then when the woman is notorious 
by the opposite manners and character, that is, when the 
man complains of nothing but such danger, and would 
suffer everything else, as you write. For if this is found to 
be true, he must not be forced into the danger, 
regardless of the annoyance. But such great signs of 
danger (even though the woman denies it), as he 
relates, are sufficient to cause a just fear. But enough of 
that. We see in such cases the very real works of the 
devil. The Lord be with you. Salute the Lord Cordatus in 
the Lord. May 10, 1531, Martin Luther.

1657 


To Mr. Wenceslaus Link, Ecclesiastics at Nuremberg. 

Grace and peace! Concerning the question you put 
to me in your last letter, my dear Wenceslaus, about 
conditional baptism, | have consulted with Master Philip, 
and after carefully considering the matter, we have come 
to the decision that conditional baptism is to be absolutely 
rejected in the church, and where one either doubts or 
does not know whether a person has been baptized, he 
should simply be baptized without condition, as if he had 
never been baptized. And our reason is this, that a 
conditional baptism says nothing, neither denies nor 
affirms, neither gives nor takes away. For suppose 
someone is baptized conditionally, he will then be forced 
to say, "Now | know as little and am as uncertain whether 
| was baptized as before, and with me all those who 
baptized me. For if the former baptism was right (which 
must be unknown, | may want or not), then the later one 
(because a conditional one) is nothing. Now if the earlier 
baptism was not a right one (which again | am obliged not 
to know), then the later baptism is again nothing, because 
it is and must be uncertain as long as the former is 
uncertain, since it is founded by the condition on the 
earlier one, which was uncertain, therefore it likewise 
remains uncertain forever. But now this must be done so 
that baptism is certain, at least for the baptizers 
themselves, who can testify to the church afterwards. In 
this case, therefore, it is safer to err with rebaptism, if a 
mistake is made at all (which we do not believe), than by 
giving an uncertain baptism, where in truth a sin is 
committed, because then it is also not a true rebaptism, 
but an uncertain rebaptism, that is, a true and certain 
baptism, against an uncertain baptism. In this way, we do 
not become raging rebaptizers. For those, as you know, 
publicly condemn the certain first baptism and do not 
want it to be called a baptism. But we want to leave the 
uncertain to its fate and God's judgment and offer a 
certain baptism. Thus we believe to be right and safe

1) The text is in any case corrupted here, since it says the 
opposite of what Luther wrote to Wenceslaus Link on the previous 
day; therefore, we have assumed Conditionalem instead: 
Inconditionalem. Possibly the error can come from Luther himself, 
because he was, as the following says, very suffering. Obviously. 
also here the speech is about a baptism after happened

C. F. G. would graciously handle it, and if it is found that 
he has run over such award and E. C. F. G. is to be

his ward's need as a faithful guardian, and E. C. F. G.'s 
need as a faithful guardian. C. F. G. himself experiences 
daily how the officials take cause from this dwindling time 
to be princes of Saxony themselves and to do what they 
want, not what they should (as | do not like to report such

Luther complains about the lifestyle of the captain Hans 
Metzsch and reports the insecurity of the city by tearing down a 
large part of the wall.

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | should not and do not want 
to take on the secular regiment, nor disparage E. C. F. 
G.'s officials. However, because the common clamor is 
so strong, and | believe that E. C. F. G. is showing loyalty 
and love to me, which | do not want. 


1) The statement of claim proves 18 points in which the defendant 
not only denies justice, but has also done the plaintiff, who is the 
guardian, all kinds of wrong, up to the imprisonment. The matter 
was investigated and Nickel Werner was released. (Burkhardt.) 


lam also guilty in many ways, and do not like to have the 
name afterwards, where something went wrong, as if | 
had kept silent to the detriment of E. C. F. G: Our captain 
Hans Metzsch is much and often amicably and seriously 
admonished by me that he should refrain from fornication 
and fornication with women, 2) it would not be too long 
for me, as a preacher, to suffer such a great annoying 
being nor to remain silent. About this he continues and 
makes it so fine that all people's mouths and noses, ears 
and eyes are full, he also confessed to me in private that 
he could not be without women. Thereupon | refused him 
all fellowship for my person and secretly forbade the 
sacrament. But since he hangs so tightly in his whores' 
braids that he shows little fear of God with them, and 
henceforth | also want to act against him in public 
sermons and judgments, | hereby request the opinion of 
E. C. F. G. that, if E. C. F. G. were to learn that | am 
working on these matters with him, E. C. F. G. would 
graciously remember this instruction, for such 
annoyance wants to shut me up, and also give others 
room for malice. He may be a good warrior, but he should 
not defend me in times of need, when he does not have 
God before his eyes, who has protected us so far without 
the stroke of a sword and still preserves us daily. 

On the other hand, | also want to prove my loyalty to 
E. C. F. G.. | have also spoken to him and others in a 
friendly manner about the demolition of the city wall. But 
since | was told that | was _a_scribe and did not 
understand such things, | let it go. Nevertheless, whether 
it would be otherwise, because such builders think that 
no one may say that | have not warned E. C. F. G. of 
damage. For | know very well how much attention was 
paid to the gates until now, that the city would be closed, 
but now the city is open day and night for more than a 
hundred steps, so that pigs and everything can run in, 
and from the field to the market, from the market to the

report and consider the matter. My head is worried 
because there are now many children of great honest 
people here, and the fears are almost annual that 
something might happen by God's decree, about which 
we would have to complain too slowly and in vain. He 
goes through with his head and makes a big noise against 
himself, that nevertheless E. C. F. G. is to be put in, so 
that no displeasure arises; for pious people suffer, but too 
much tears the sack, and a spark might easily arise 
among the impatient, who would not be satisfied with his 
defiance, cursing and tyranny. It is, praise God, a pious, 
peaceful, obedient city. But the oppression and defiance 
may turn them back, so that they would not think of 
fearing a bailiff over their sovereign. Please again, E. C. 
F. G. want to receive this writing as out of pure loyalty. |

anyone. But, if | am being nonsensical, then they will use 
E. C. F. G.'s goods and money as they please; even

Luther speaks about Hartung's matter in this way: the 
woman must be cited before the doors of the church, as 
is the custom. If she now appears, she may state the 
reason why she left the husband and accuse him. But if 
she should not appear, the man, since he has good 
testimony, shall be acquitted of that woman who has 
gone astray, and shall be left to his conscience to decide 
whether he wishes to marry again. The matter does not

They cannot ask for forgiveness, and yet they may not

On the consumption of the Lord's Supper under both forms. 


From the collection of Caspar Sagittarius at Jena in Schutze,

vol. XXI, 1586. (This proof is missing in De Wette.) 

To M. Oswald Losan at Leipzig, on both forms of the 
sacrament. 


If conscience is certain that both forms of the 
sacrament are Christ's institution, which is not at the 
discretion of men, that they may freely change it as they 
please: if it is not permitted to use both forms, then it is 
better to abstain entirely [from the sacrament] than to use 
only one form, contrary to conscience and contrary to 
Christ's institution, with a change in the form handed 
down by God. For abstaining from it altogether is done 
here without sin, since it is not a sin. 


1) In the text: "Scorpionario (?)", for which we have conjicirt 
scopionario, formed from xxxxx, the Wait. 


but is forcibly stolen from us by those who should 
administer it. And here, at the same time, the answer to 
the third question is given: that, in the meantime, the 
communion of faith or spiritual nourishment is sufficient, 
of which Augustine says: "Believe, then you have eaten, 
because the pastors are not allowed to rob the bodily 
food in a tyrannical way or to force it by force. Therefore, 
the spiritual food remains with necessity. 

Secondly, one must be careful that the sacrament is 
not taken privately or secretly, both because of many 
disadvantages and dangers, and especially because of 
the institution of Christ, who wants this sacrament to 
serve for public confession, saying: "Do this in 
remembrance of me," that is, for preaching and 
proclamation, as Paul calls it [1 Cor. 11:26]. Therefore, it 
is more correct to abstain from it altogether. 

Thirdly, if some have communicated elsewhere under 
both forms, they are obliged to confess when they are 
questioned about it afterwards, although it is not 
necessary that you, if it is denied you at home in your 
parish, receive it in another parish, because you are not 
a member of the foreign parish, but it is enough to suffer 
the tyranny in your parish patiently and to keep silent, or 
to travel elsewhere for the time being, until you are 
questioned about your faith. Anno 1531.

rybdis, | hold thus: that faith only accepts justification, 
namely Christ, but does not in the same way 
communicate justification through the worthiness of 
its work. And when it is said that faith purifies the 
heart, | do not mean the work or the merit or the 
worthiness of faith, but Christ who has been taken in 
faith. But more about this in the letter to Philip. The 
wise men of this world are moved against your 
German books about the edict of the emperor 3) in 
many ways. They are exceedingly unwilling that 
things should be called by their right name, and while 
they demand of us that, when they have declared a 
robber to be a robber, in order that they may rightfully 
execute punishment upon him with the sword, If, on 
account of this unpleasant duty, they justify and 
approve their deed, they do not have so much brain 
as to realize that the lawful words of an ecclesiastical 
authority are not invectives but just censures, that 
they are not invectives but due chastisements and 
divine judgments pronounced against the wicked. But 
they may have a good year, and, if they will, perish. 
Therefore, continue as you are doing, strengthen the 
church of Christ, who may keep us strong in spirit and 
healthy in body as long as possible. Pray for me. 
Farewell. From [Swabian] Hall, on Friday after Peter 
and Paul [June 30] in the year of Christ 31.

Luther complains that the sequestrators want to take from 
Magdalena Staupitz the little house in Grimma that was 
prescribed to her.

1) Out results the time determination of this letter. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! There are some poor people 
coming to me, among them Doctor Staupitz's sister, 
Magdalen von Staupitz; the visitators have given her a 
little house from the monastery in Grimma (Grym) and 
appointed her schoolmistress of the maidens. But the 
gentlemen "Sequestrator", as they are called, go to her 
and want to take it away from her again. Now mau tells 
me credibly that neither E. C. F. G. nor the landscape 
opinion has not been that mau should tear up the order 
of visitation, but everyone says and boasts that not only 
E. C. F. G. is of the serious opinion, but also that the 
whole countryside has most humbly requested that the 
order of the visitation be observed. Accordingly, my most 
submissive request is that E. C. F. G., if it does not want 
to be done any longer, should suspend such 
sequestration for a while and postpone it until further 
notice. Dean, if it should be the opinion that sequestration 
should destroy the visitation, that would be an unpleasant 
insult to E. C. F. G.. | want to be silent of the damage, as 
all parishes and ecclesiastical office order would go to 
ruin; for my person | would rather that E. C. F. G. take 
such goods, which (sic) the monastery (of which one 
makes such unnecessary clamor and elevates foreign 
part to service), to himself and did with it what they only 
wanted. | wanted to help, to answer to God and the world. 
What should it be, then, that one gathers mosquitoes and 
devours camels, and weighs down E. C. F. G.'s heart 
with loose futile things. | believe that | also mean E. C. F. 
G. with fidelity and do not want to harm him gladly. May 
the merciful God give E. C. F. G. His spirit to intervene 
with a merciful wrath, since they otherwise have power 
and right, amen. July 3, 1531.

herself instructed me to write this to you. The other things 
that you write about the carelessness of the church 
servants and about the contempt of the peasants are all 
too true; in any case, patience is not only useful to us, but

With regard to marriage, | praise your will, but see to 
it that you do not marry in any case before the parsonage 
is completed, so that you can live alone with your wife. 
For it is unbearable to live with a wife in another master's 
house. | know that virgin, Hanna Zeschin, well; | have

housekeeping, but nevertheless | do not want you to 
believe my judgment; you must not admit anything to 
lanyone until you have seen the girl yourself on some 
loccasion. For in figure she is not very outstanding, but 
mediocre, if perhaps you also want to keep an eye out in 
this respect. Be well in the Lord and pray for me. We are

devotee! A few days ago you sent us half of Doctor 
Staupitz's sister, who had been given the little house 
in Grimma, which we had given her out of mercy, by 
the deceased. 





We have written that, because we have, in the grant 
that has been made, prescribed for ourselves the 
houses that we have graciously given to the poor in 
towns and villages, that no change should be made 
in them, in addition to others, so that our minds and 
the minds of the countryside would not be troubled, 
that in what | and the Visitatores have ordered to be 
done, some disruption (zerraitung) or change should 
be made, as well as such not happening at all,

To the men highly esteemed in the Lord, Johann 
Goebel, Liborin of Magdeburg, Matthias Kroitsch 
(Krotisch), 1) Adam Schumann, true servants of 
the Word in Zwickau, his exceedingly dear 
brothers in Christ. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | wish it to be known to 
you, dearest brethren, that through my efforts and the 
cooperation of other very good men, we have finally, with 
great difficulty, persuaded the prince and the rulers to 
release your pastor from those trustworthy blocks 2) of 
yours. For they were very reluctant to release him and 
wanted to force him on those people again, but we, 
moved by his danger that it would not be useful for him 
to remain there with those bitter beasts, finally managed 
to get him released with grace, adding this condition that 
he should not leave the prince's territory for another 
ministry. For the prince wants to employ him in his lands, 
not among beasts, as those are, but at least among men. 
| am writing this so that, if those beasts should boast, you 
may have the certain truth of the matter, which you can 
prove, for as | have said, the matter is in truth. The priest 
is in grace and favor with all good men, those beasts are 
hated, detested, as their extraordinary hopefulness and 
ingratitude deserve. For they belong to the number of 
those of whom Jacob said [Gen. 49:7, 6.], "Cursed be 
their wrath, that it is so fierce, and their fury, that it is so 
troublesome; let not my soul enter into their counsel." 
Now if any of you, or all of you, should be troubled to stay 
there, | will turn you out of the way.

has been released by the prince from those people with 
you. For he was in fear because of danger for him with 
those hard people, and ordered him to stay in his lands 
by all means. For he intends to take care of him in another 
place, which | hope will happen shortly. Therefore, for 
Christ's sake, do not worry, nor be anxious, but have a 
little patience and let the)e furies make and boast. It is 
enough for us that we not only have Christ, whom they 
afflict and torment, graciously in spirit, but also the prince 
and the best men at court exceedingly favorably.

way, only

To Albrecht, Duke of Prussia. 


Luther gives his opinion about the Apology against the 
Deutschmeister. In the insertion he recommends D. Basilius Axt, 
and his brother-in-law Hans von Bors, who served in Memel, and 
promises to procure a preacher to Liefland in Brismann's place. 


From Faber's collection of letters, p. 6, reprinted in De Wette, 
vol. IV, p. 290 and in Erl. Ausg., vol. 54, p. 252. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, 
gracious lord! As E. F. G. has written to us and requested 
to see the Apologia 1) or Responsibility, we have done 
so, and also find that much good reason and causes are 
sufficiently set forth therein, and at the request of our 
most gracious Lord, the Elector, have sent our opinion to 
the Court, and provide that it has come to E. F. G. at last, 
or will now come with Doctor Basilio. It has also seemed 
good to us that it should not be necessary to be so 
precise and expansive in the indicated matters, because 
all adversaries are of a kind and nature where they 
cannot do anything to the right main reasons, they tweak 
a word or two, and cleverly get it over with, so that the 
matter gets off track, and the main reasons get out of 
sight and lose their appearance, as has happened to me 
daily in all my letters up to now; therefore, the best thing 
to do with such people is to keep it short and firm, and 
not to let oneself be led by the main reasons. However, 
E. F. G. will know how to understand such things better 
than we can indicate. E. F. G. only be confident and do 
not let such things worry you, God will do it well. If they 
did not have this to talk about, they would have to have 
another, so they have this more than another; no one can 
shut the devil's mouth, he must talk. Christ our Lord 
strengthen and comfort E. F. G. to do and suffer all his 
gracious will, Amen. August 24, 1531.

To D. Robert Barnes. 


On the intended divorce of King Henry VIII of England. - This 
concern exists in two very different relations. We have already 
reported one of them in our edition, Vol. XVII, 202, No. 1268. The 
one given here is, as Kolde I. c. p. 397, is to be regarded as the 
original one already because of its more personal character. 


This relation is found in Buddeus, p. 325 (incomplete); from 
Aurifaber's unprinted collection in Schitze, vol. Il, p. 235; in Cod. 
Goth. 168. 4. and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 300. German in Walch, 
vol. XXI, 1386. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Concerning the matter of 
the King of England, my opinion is that which you heard 
orally, my dear Antonius,°) since we discussed this matter 
in confidence, namely, that | like the decision of the 
Louvain most of all those who judge the opposite, and 
the king can follow it with a very sure conscience, indeed, 
he must follow it, if he wants to be safe before God, that 
is, he cannot in any way repudiate the queen, the wife of 
the deceased brother, whom he has married, and by this 
repudiation make both the mother and the daughter 
incestuous. For now | do not dispute what the 
dispensation of the pope to take the wife of the deceased 
brother is worth, but | say this: It may be, after all, that the 
king, by taking the wife of the deceased 


1) This will mean its large family. 

2) De Wette dates this letter from September 5, while Kolde, 
M. Luther, Vol. Il, p. 396 and p. 598 ad p. 396, perhaps places it 
more correctly (in view of the previous letter) on Sept. 3, and 
Luther will have given this concern, which is put in the form of a 
letter, to Barnes himself. 

3) Barnes was staying in Wittenberg under this name at the 
time. 








However, it will be a far more heinous and greater sin to 
repudiate the married woman and dissolve the marriage 
in such a cruel way that both the king and even the queen 
and princess must always be under the shame of incest, 
although in fact there is no reason why he would want to 
disgrace her with this terrible accusation, and above that 
also dissolve the marriage. These two exceedingly great 
sins are so great that no consideration is to be given toa 
lesser sin, especially one that is past and already 
forgiven, and in truth no longer a sin. For the conjugal 
union of the man and the woman is divine and natural 
right. But the prohibition to take the wife of the deceased 
brother belongs to the given (positivi), not to the divine 
right, unless one wants to argue that all rights are divine, 
because God has approved all rights. Therefore, those 
who call upon the king to violate his rights torture his 
conscience in vain; indeed, they sin most grievously 
against the divine law. 

But that they say that it is against the divine right to 
marry the wife of the deceased brother, namely 3 Mos. 
18, 16.If they want to follow the Mosaic Law and push us 
under this law, then they will make it so that the king in 
this case is not only required to keep the married queen, 
but also, if she is not yet married, to take her in any case 
and raise up his brother's seed, since the deceased 
brother has left no children by this woman, as clearly 5 
Mos. 25, 5. and Matth. 22,4) 24. is mentioned by the 
Sadducees before Christ. 

But here they say that the law 5 Mos. 25 was a 
ceremonial one, which had to give way to the law 3 Mos. 
18, which was a moral one, because the things 
concerning ceremonies had ceased, those concerning 
morals (moralia) had not ceased. Who does not see 
here that such gloss makers either be 


4) Wrong in Latin: Matthaei XVIII. 


1690 


Letters from the year 1531. No. 1838. 


1691 





or that these things are not said by them with good 
judgment nor with any truthfulness? Namely, so quickly 
they found a gloss with which they could make a mockery 
of the law 3 Mos. 18; here they did not want to have a 
gloss. Therefore, it is clear that they have set out to gloss 
over the law that is inconvenient to them, not with good 
judgment, but according to their will. 

Then, how do they prove that the law of Deut. 25 is or 
was ceremonial, especially since they want the 
conscience to be made certain? Is it enough to say: We 
want it so, we say so: therefore it should be a ceremonial 
one. On the other hand, we say that the law in the 5th 
book of Moses is a ceremonial one. We say that the law 
in the 5th book of Moses was a moral one, because it 
was in fact a law that served the community, to preserve 
families, to keep inheritances, to obtain heirs, that is, it 
was given to obtain goods, to increase and strengthen 
the community, Like cultivating the field at this or that 
time, in this or that way, so that it bears fruit all the more 
abundantly, is something that truly serves the community 
and is moral, because through this custom goods are 
brought about both for the household and for the 
community. Therefore, the Jews had to observe this law 
no less than any other law, and the text clearly indicates 
that it speaks of the preservation of families and 
inheritance, which are certainly not ceremonial matters, 
but those that concern the community and necessary 
moral matters. 

And, dear, we want to assume that the law in the 5th 
book of Moses was a ceremonial one, as these people 
argue, what is the point? since it is nevertheless 
established that the Jews under Moses were forced to 
keep this law, like circumcision and other ceremonies. 
Here they may answer us how the Jews could take the 
wife of a dead brother when it was forbidden by divine 
right 3 Mos. 18. For these two laws dispute against each 
other, if both are to be understood also by the deceased 
brother. Therefore it is obvious that they do not consider 
the words and persons of the law right. 





But if they want to pretend that the ceremonial 
offences have been removed and the moral offences 
have remained, therefore one must not keep the law in 
the 5th book of Moses, but one must keep the law in the 
3rd book of Moses, then first of all it is still certain that the 
Jews have kept both, as | have said. Therefore, these 
people will be forced to admit with necessity that the Jews 
did not sin against the law in the 3rd book of Moses by 
keeping the law of the 5th book of Moses. Therefore, 
those who have such an opinion that ceremonial things 
are abolished, that they are fatal for us, and that we are 
not allowed to keep them, must not cite the contrary law 
in the 3rd book of Moses, but the abolition itself. Now, 
however, they conclude from the abrogation and base 
themselves on it, and yet they cite the contrary law as a 
saying of Moses in order to give credence to their opinion. 
But just by this they show that they do such sophistry not 
out of the striving for truth but out of the desire for victory, 
and that they practice that deception which Aristotle calls 
the inference from a non thing to a thing (a non causa, 
ad causam.). For under Moses, where the law had not 
yet been abolished in the 5th chapter of Moses, neither 
the abolition could give an opportunity for a reason for 
proof, nor the opposition of the laws, since both laws had 
validity and were kept. Therefore, the reason for the proof 
of the opposition must have much less validity now. But if 
there is any ground of proof, let it be the doctrine of 
abolition itself, and let these people desist from urging still 
further the contrary law in the 3rd book of Moses. Those 
who think that ceremonial things are forbidden to us, do 
not understand anything about it, neither what abolition is, 
nor what a ceremonial thing is. Ceremonial things after 
abolition are free and indifferent things (indifferentia), 
no longer required and necessary, 1 Cor. 7:18: "If aman 
is circumcised, let him not have a foreskin, where he 
teaches that it is not necessary to have a foreskin, 
otherwise believing Jews would be obliged to restore the 
foreskin. Therefore, the ablation

The king's laws are not violated, but they obey the king 
and do not rule over the king's laws. Thus, God allows all 
authorities, yes, He approves of them using their own 
laws, but with the reservation and exception of His will, 
which they must yield to and obey with their laws. Thus, 
the given laws, where they conflict with the law of God or 
nature, always give way to these very laws of God or 
nature as the higher one. Therefore, since the law in the 
5th book of Moses is a given law, and not a law of nature, 
if in any matter it offends against the law of nature, it must 
yield to the law of nature and give way, as the lower to 
the higher. And so also, if according to the law in the 5. 
Book of Moses it seems that he is forced to take his 
daughter Achsa as wife, nevertheless, because Achsa is 
not only his brother's wife (for the words of the law are 
actually and simply to take), but also his daughter, he is 
therefore prevented by another and higher law from 
taking such a brother's wife, who is a daughter for him, 
because the law of nature forbids to marry the daughter, 
although the given law commands to take the wife of the 
deceased brother. But why this lengthy discussion, my 
dear Antony, unless perhaps in the future you would have 
to dispute with people who are ignorant of the law? 

We want to come to the point and say: that Moses was 
dead, but lived for the Jewish people, and that we are not 
bound by his laws. Therefore, we do not want to allow 
anything that comes from Moses as a lawgiver, unless it 
is also approved by our laws, that is, natural and secular, 
and we do not want to put the communities of the whole 
world in confusion, but we want to flee the seditions and 
disturbances of all laws and respectability as a poison. 
The same may serve his commonwealth, we have our 
legislators in these matters. Therefore, this is to be 
discussed: if by the laws of the pope or the emperor, the 
marriage 


1) Instead of et, we have assumed ut. 


between a brother and the wife of the deceased brother 
is forbidden, whether then 2) the King of England is 
bound not to marry the queen forbidden to him® and, 
having taken her, to repudiate her. Here must be 
answered: By all means not, but he shall be obliged to 
keep her, under danger of bliss and eternal damnation. 
This is proved thus: First, it is not established that it is 
forbidden to marry one's brother's wife, neither by natural 
law nor by divine law, but only by a given right. For the 
lawgiver Moses is dead and nothing to us. For we read 
that Abraham and Nahor, who lived before the Law of 
Moses and under the natural law, married their brother's 
daughters; this degree was subsequently forbidden by 
Moses by a given law. And Jacob married two sisters,* 
which afterwards Moses also forbade. Therefore it 
remains only that it is forbidden by a human and given 
right to marry the wife of the deceased brother. But, as 
we have said, marriage is a divine and natural right. Now, 
where the divine and the given law conflict with each 
other, the given law must give way to the divine; therefore 
Christ also abolished the law of divorce in Moses in order 
to establish the divine law of marriage. Therefore, if the 
king of England sinned by marrying his dead brother's 
wife, if he sinned against the human and civil law of the 
emperor or the pope; If, then, the emperor or the pope 
have indulged him in their laws, he has not sinned at all, 
because the same God who approves of the civil law 
given by the emperor also approves of the emperor's law, 
which is indulged by the emperor, because he has given 
him the power to give and indulge in laws, and, that | may 
say so, the keys of binding and loosing in the country 
which is subject to him. The same | say about the pope, 
where he

with civil tyranny; although he does not bind with any 
right, it is much more valid if he slackens than if he binds. 
But if the king repudiates the queen, he will sin with the 
gravest offense against the divine law, which says: 
"What God has joined together, let not man put 
asunder," that is, let not man put asunder those 1) whom 
God has joined together either in His order or by His 
permission, because His joining together, whether by 
right or by a human act, is higher than a human order. 
Therefore, if these two laws conflict with each other, let 
Ulan take care that the king of England does not keep a 
human law, so that he sins against the divine one, but so 
that he keeps the divine law, let him be forgiven if a sin 
is committed against the human law. But, as | have said, 
where the pope or the emperor (if he recognizes the 
emperor's laws) have dispensed, there is no sin. 

There you have, my dear Antonius, poured out my 
opinion into your bosom. For | do not know whether it is 
useful that the same be published, lest perhaps my 
name harm this matter more, which, as you know well 
enough, is so hated and detested that, although | speak 
the truth, it is nevertheless condemned out of hatred for 
my name. However, so that you can safely discuss my 
opinion with friends, | will allow you to either suppress or 
publish it at your discretion. Indeed, if the hatred of my 
name were not in the way, | would wish it to be useful to 
the king and queen, so that they would not be seduced 
and driven by the sophists to such a worthless and 
wicked divorce, from which, when it is done, they will 
suffer constant misery in their consciences. But 
whatever may happen, be it that this divorce has already 
happened, be it that the king is driven by the prestige of 
arid doctors to make the marriage

If the king does not divorce the queen, advise his friends, 
all of whom you can, to abhor this divorce. And if the 
adversaries should have completely taken the king, let 
ours try with all diligence to at least persuade the queen 
not to consent to the divorce in any way, but rather die 
than let her conscience be guilty of such a great offense 
before God, but firmly believe that she is the right and 
lawful queen of England, made and approved for that 
purpose by God Himself. For it must not be allowed that 
she complains with a false accusation, believing such a 
great sin, which is no sin. For that would be to fear 
falsehood in an erring conscience and to worship instead 
of God. For if they cannot save the king (which God 
forbid), they may at least save the queen's soul alone, so 
that, if the divorce cannot be prevented, she may bear 
this great evil of the greatest injustice as her cross, but 
by no means approve or consent to it. |, who am unable 
to do anything else, turn to God in prayer, that Christ may 
prevent this divorce and make the advice of Ahitophel, 
who advises it, null and void, or if he does not want to 
prevent it, that he at least give the queen a strong faith 
and a constant and sure conscience, that she is and will 
be the lawful and rightful queen of England, against the 
will of the gates of the world and of hell. You are quite at

No. 1843. 1844. 1845. 1701 

To the dear and very sincere man, Mr. M. G. Spalatin, 

the brave and faithful servant of Christ, his 
exceedingly dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! My dear George, nothing 
is known or has been heard here of that miraculous 
powder that is healing against the plague. Christ, the true 
physician, protect and keep you, amen. But | hope that 
this plague, as almost everywhere else, will be slow and 
mild. 

No one has given us the confession of John 
Fresleben, nor have we ever seen it. The Lord will repay 
the Zwickau lumps for what they deserve through this 
great ingratitude and their raging against the very good 
man. But their custom is to grieve the Holy Spirit, yet to 
their undoing. | would like to write my defense, but | am 
so distracted by incidental business and so detained by 
the duties | owe that not even the seventh part of me 
could be at her service, while she demands me 
completely; so one day after the other always passes and 
postpones the matter. Every day | spend two hours 
correcting the prophets. But why am | writing this to you, 
since you know it very well? 

It is certain that the Roman pope is estranged from 
the emperor, and one must assume that the Frauzose is 
also averse to him, because he has ordered the 
plundering of the goods and chattels of the Genevese 1) 
throughout France (I do not know for what small insult), 
out of hatred (as one believes) against the emperor. The 
same is suspected of the Englishman, namely because 
of the sign that he seeks to push the queen away from 
him by divorce, for you know that she is the mother-sister 
of the emperor. This is how it goes in this exceedingly 
wicked world, these are the aspirations of the children of 
men. May God graciously look upon the emperor for us, 
and, as before all his [the emperor's] enemies, put the 
pope to shame, Amen. The comet makes me think that 
both the emperor and Ferdinand are threatened with evil, 
because it first raises its tail.

the obvious hostility and the outrageous extortions of the Cardinal 
at Mainz. 


Magdeburg. 


From Cod. a 11 of the Bremen City Library, reprinted in Krafft, 
Briefe und Documente, p. 71. 


Hans Hornbeck, a godly man, an exceedingly great 
friend and patron of Luther, greets you very 
respectfully, my dearest father in Christ, and humbly 
asks that you reply to his enclosed letter, and has 
asked me very much that | should send it to you and 
request a reply. If you do this, you will be doing 
something pleasing to a Christian man. 


1) "Itis indisputable that a writing of the poet Crotus Rubeanus 
is meant, who had been Luther's friend earlier, and had turned 
back to Catholicism" (De Wette). On this, Seidemann notes in De 
Wette, vol. VI, p. 559, note 3: Apologia Alberti Archiepi- scopi 
Mogunt. Lipsiae 1531. 4. 


2) In De Wette the text reads: Ego must have in idolum 
magnum tuum, (?) sed certe Prophetae etc.. Instead we have 
assumed: in idolum Mogun- tinum, sed certe. Prophetae etc. Also 
in the letter to Spalatin of Oct. 7, 1521 (No. 430), the Cardinal of 
Mainz is called idolum Moguntinum (the Erlanger Briefw., Vol. Ill, 
p. 237 offers: Maguntinum). Menius complied with this request to 
write against the Mainzer by his writing: Ad Apologiam Jo. Croti 
Rubeani Responsio. See Burkhardt, p. 199. 





But since you are idle, as Ebeling Alemann 3) 
reported, so that Luther has nothing to do but lecture, 
preach, and write so many books and letters in all 
parts of the world, you will be able to answer this letter 
all the better. For | hear that the authors of the letter 
are good men who love Christ with all their hearts, 
who do not want to do anything that is incompatible 
with the Gospel, which you can easily see from the 
letter they have written to you. | believe that you know 
what the Mainz bride is planning to do in Halle, for he”) 
has publicly spat out what he had already thought of 
himself long ago, and no longer wants to limp along 
on either side, but to fight with us in open warfare. | 
do not dare to write how large a sum and amount of 
money the tyrant extorts from his subjects, namely an 
unbelievable one and hardly ever heard of in these 
lands. He has appointed new advisors at court, 
namely "the provost of the cathedral is his court 
master, three canons and an abbot are his highest 
advisors. Farewell in Christ, my dear father.

Honorable, respectable, wise, favorable friends! We

of your church ceremonies, and in turn we kindly inform 
you that we are meant to advise you for the peace of 
your churches, as much as we are able. For we desire 
nothing more than that true Christian doctrine be taught 
peacefully and in harmony, in honor of God and for the 
comfort of souls. You may think, however, that we can 
give little advice or act on this matter of yours, since your 
preachers are not known to us or related to us. But we 
do not want to hide our opinion from you. We have read 
the list of ceremonies, and find nothing unchristian or 
criminal in it, and especially as far as private absolution 
is concerned, it is good for many reasons that this 
private absolutio be preserved. Because the time of

We mean that it is good that you summon him before an

will put an end to such bickering as reported and teach 
more peacefully those things that serve for correction, 
godliness, faith and the knowledge of Christ, and the 
obedience of the people. And even though we think that 
he does not respect our advice very much, you may 
nevertheless tell him from me, Martino Luther, that | kindly 
admonish him, as the one who has now for a long time led 
and tried the preaching ministry by God's grace, as he 
was also admonished by D. Johann Pomeranus has 
previously admonished him not to be too bold in spiritual 
matters. For such boldness is annual, as has been found 
in many examples in our time. That he also see to it that 
he does not cause trouble by his futile quarreling. But if 
he will not mend his ways by this action and admonition 
of yours, it is our advice that you let him go out of your city 
in a friendly manner and do not shun the support of the 
common people. For you shall do your office for the peace 
of the city in God's name, and not fear the mob, but trust 
God to assist you in your office, as far as you seek and 
serve God's honor. In addition, the other preachers are to 
exhort and instruct the people to obedience to the 
authorities, and without a doubt, honorable and pious 
people will not sit down in this against a council. So we do 
not doubt that you are skilled enough that, although there 
are some useless people who want to cause trouble, you 
know how to calm them. 

This is our concern upon your report, and we hereby 
request and admonish you that you should not, through 
these or such annoyances, distance yourselves from the 
Holy Gospel and

monkey, do not fit here. Even the words taken from Bugenhagen's 
expert opinion (in Lisch, Jahrb. XXIV, p. 149): "bespottet de bunte 
Misse, alse he se német", prove that the Misse preacher of that

Graciously allow you to go to your fatherland, if we judge 
that you are fit for this office. For the very good prince 
wishes to advise not only his own lands, but also the 
churches of other lands, as much as he can. But since we 
approve of your teaching, and your modesty, and your 
insight and diligence in every kind of office, we have 
judged that the office of teaching and governing the 
church at Winsheim can be safely entrusted to you. And 
we have written this judgment of ours about you to the 
most noble prince, and he has ordered that you be 
graciously permitted to move to Winsheim, and we exhort 
you that you faithfully present the gospel of Christ, which 
you have hitherto taught purely with us, also there, in 
order to glorify Christ's honor and for the salvation of the 
people, and not suffer the purity of our teaching to be 
corrupted by new teachings, which godless people sow 
everywhere, who do not know Christ; and only remind 
you to be continually mindful of the dangers of the times, 
which, if ever, especially now require careful and vigilant 
teachers. For we see that disputations are arising 
everywhere which aim especially at overthrowing that 
part of our doctrine which we believe to be most 
necessary for the church, that is, the doctrine of the 
forgiveness of sins and of righteousness by faith. This is 
what we thought we had to write to you about the will of 
our prince, the Duke of Saxony, Elector, in accordance 
with our love for you, and we ask Christ to govern your 
ministry for his glory and for the salvation of the people.

Grace and peace in Christ! We expect you, my dear 
Pommer, as a returning one, as soon as it can be done 
comfortably because of the birth of your wife (for which | 
pray that it may be a happy one). We have served the

because | am overloaded and often ill; then | neglect the 
church treasury and it demands its pastor. "I can't wait."

a conflagration for many. But Christ has One who said to 
him [Ps. 110:1], "Sit thou at my right hand," and [Ps. 2:7], 
"Thou art my son." If this one lies, let us worship 
Campanus and his god, amen, that is, it will not happen. 
To me the Lord has given a Martin full of my Kathe, and 
we are well, only that the peasants, who have become 
rich in this year, make us a theurung (carstiam, as they 
say) by their wickedness, to show themselves grateful for 
the Gospel, by which they have been delivered from so 
many evils. May the world that refuses to be blessed 
perish, amen. Greet your Eva and Sarah in my and my

. Grace and peace to Christ! One hears here, my dear 
Martin, that John Campanus has crept in with you; if this 
is true, and | can do nothing else, then | certainly regret 
the fate of your church very much. For | believe that you 
know this child of Satan and adversary of the Son of 
God, whom he blasphemes even more than Arius did. 
Therefore, | ask you for the sake of Christ, that you work 
with the Senate, and wherever you can, so that they may 
not allow such furies, who have not been called, since 
without a calling even an angel should not be heard, and 
also Gabriel only gave the Annunciation to Mary, since 
he was sent by God. And if they are so careless as to 
hear any people who come without being sent and 
called, it is not without danger for you to remain there. 
But daily | am anxious to tear you away from there, even 
because of that Zwinglian with you, who, as | hear, does 
enough for evil. Finally, | hope that you will soon be a 
pastor in a town near the river Saale. For they are 
beginning to want the preaching positions there to be 
visited. ') In the meantime, be well with your family and 
pray for me, and in the meantime be patient and strong 
in Christ. On Monday after Catharine [Nov. 27] Anno

Grace and peace! | believe, my dear Amsdorf, that 
life is beginning to disgust you because of the infinite 
wickedness of men. The Zwinglians got along with the 
foreign Swiss, 2) but under the most ignominious 
conditions, except for the disgrace and defeat they 
suffered so unhappily after losing the leader of their 
doctrine. But this is the end of the glory they sought by 
blaspheming against the Lord's Supper. And yet they do 
not repent, even though they have recanted almost 
everything in the [peace] conditions and have justified the 
papists completely. Yes, they have been forced to break 
off all alliances with foreign princes, as with the landgrave 
2c. "It is said" [Phil. 3, 19.], "Whose honor is put to 
shame." 

Besides, | have nothing of news, only that one again

people. God do what is good, amen. | recommend you

you are idle in your office, as you yourselves indicate, so 
that you will not share in their plagues. God has already 
punished twice: first under Muenzer, now under Zwingli. 
2) | am worried that Augsburg will also have its share. If 
you cannot help it, then do as the Jews did, captured at 
Babel, who also had to live without a temple, without 
worship, without the rites of their Mosiah, only being 
satisfied with the Word for 70 years. For it is not yet to be 
expected that you should begin your own in corners. 3) 
Endure such temptation, and in the meantime comfort 
yourselves with reading and teaching of the Holy Word 
and desiring and praying; as Daniel prayed at Babylon 
against Hierusalem, so also you, desiring the Sacrament 
with sighing until God sees it. There is not such a great 
lack of baptism; after all, under the papacy, one baptizes 
in houses, therefore you can still baptize and pray there, 
as in the church. In the same way, you can bless 
marriages in houses, as they are otherwise trusted; and 
if it cannot be otherwise, and a council forbids such 
baptizing, then | would take it from papists beforehand, 
with the condition that we keep their baptism right, but 
not their faith and doctrine in other matters. The 
enthusiasts have neither baptism nor sacrament. So

To Wenceslaus Link in Nuremberg. 


In response to the rumor that there was secret discord among 
the Nuremberg preachers, Luther exhorted vigilance, pointing to 
the warning example of Zwingli's death. Last from Carlstadt. 


From Aurifaber's unprinted collection, p. 145, in Schitze, vol. 
ll, p. 256 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 331. 


1) Here we have deleted "their", which is missing in an old copy 
in Swabian dialect, which is probably made by Huberinus himself. 
It has been communicated to Prof. Veesenmeyer De Wette. 

2) With this Luther points to Zwingli's death, who had fallen in 
the battle of Cappel on October 11, 1531. 

3) Still in 1533 the same conditions were in Augsburg, as we 
can see from Luther's letter to Hans Honold of July 21, 1533. 





Grace and peace in the Lord Jesus Christ! | have not 
written to you for a long time, my dear Wenceslaus, nor 
do you need me to write to you, since | am very busy. But 
it is up to you, who have more leisure to write to me more 
often. | hope that my thoughts will be wrong, which some 
slight rumor has aroused in me, as if among you servants 
of the word at the church in Nuremberg a secret discord 
is harbored: | could hardly be told anything else that 
would be more distressing for me than this evil. Therefore 
| also ask you, as | know and have tested your sincere 
and straight mind, that you, as you do, help us to fight 
and watch against these evil spirits [Eph. 6:12], who are 
not content to rage in earthly things, but strive to hurl their 
fiery darts into heavenly things as well and to disturb the 
kingdom of God, which we are. If Osiander does not yet 
approve of our opinion of conditional baptism: 
nevertheless; we want to carry him and not push him 
harder, just as he will carry us and not make us bitter until 
Christ has untied this knot. We see the judgment of God 
now for the second time; once on Minzer, now on 
Zwingli. | have been a prophet in that | have said: God 
will not suffer these raging and furious blasphemies, of 
which those were full, in that they ridiculed our God, 
called us flesh-eaters and blood-drinkers and bloody 
people (cruentos), and gave other frightening names. 
"This is what they wanted; look before Augsburg!" 

About Carlstadt you write nothing certain, and | am 
surprised that such a story has remained hidden from us 
so long, then that it has come to us so doubtfully that 
even today we cannot admit that we know something 
certain. Philip says: If God will not seize Carlstadt with 
unlimited (absoluta) power and wisdom, with ordinary 
(ordinata) He will not seize him. So great is the skill in 
this monster to slip away, to escape, to avoid the 
dangers, which, however, he himself brings about. But he 
will be true who said [Sir.3, 27. Vulg.], "He who loves 
danger will perish in it.”

In the first volume it is said: "This letter belongs to the year 1532, 
because Abbot Friedrich married himself according to Nopitsch 
the 28th of June 1532 with Anna, G. Schwarzens daughter. The 
date we set is according to Seidemann at De Wette, vol. VI, p. 
497, and also Burkhardt, p. 78, does not object to it. But to us, if 
the wedding really took place only in June, the month of January 
is very doubtful. .

while the marriage state has always remained unharmed 
throughout the world! Finally, how great monstrosities, 
wars and shameful deeds of the kingdoms will God 
punish in that day, while He will glorify with eternal 
crowns the exceedingly lowly works of the marriage 
state, which, however, are the most useful and serve 
only for peace! And to which perennial is the dominion 
over all things due, if not to the spouses? although 
afterwards, since the wickedness of men urged it, the 
authorities were necessarily forced to arrogate it to 
themselves to a great extent, and now this dominion 
already serves more the wars, but marriage is the 
simplest of all and a dominion of peace. Rejoice, 
therefore, and give thanks to God, who has given you 
this way of life and has transferred you, as it were, from 
the sea to the harbor, from the world to paradise. It may 
be what Paul says [1 Cor. 7:28], that in this state there is 
tribulation of the flesh, but there is at the same time the 
comfort of the spirit, since Solomon says [Proverbs 
18:22]: "He will receive 1) joy from the Lord." Further, 
what is the celibate life, which all seek and admire more 
than marriage, but - not only tribulation, but - a sea and 
a storm, yea, a hell of tribulations? So let the world, 
caught in error, rage, and because it does not want to 
bear a tribulation, let it love instead seas and storms of 
tribulations, and what it loves, it will find. Christ keep 2) 
and keep us in a better mind, that we may overcome the 
one tribulation, and not even feel one or the other evil 
among so many goods that we possess in this 
arrangement of life. These people are so drunk that they 
do not feel innumerable evils of their state because of 
the one good of a little honor, like a soldier who gives his 
life away, preferring a gold florin to the salvation of body 
and soul. We, on the other hand, should be so drunk on 
our goods that, when an evil occurs, we think it is 
something good.

1726 Letters from the year 1532. 


The people who want to leave their status and clothes 
and go according to the opinion of the priest and 
preacher. Now you know without a doubt that 
unnecessary renewals, especially in divine matters, are 
very dangerous, because the lords and great ones are 
moved by them without cause, for which peace and 
tranquility everything should and must serve. Because 
the brothers and sisters (who first began the Gospel with 
you) lead an honest life, and have an honest, disciplined 
congregation, besides faithfully teaching and keeping the 
pure Word, my friendly request is that Your Worship 
would not allow unrest and bitterness to befall them for 
the sake of this matter, that they still wear spiritual 
garments, and keep old praiseworthy customs, which are 
not against the Gospel. For such monasteries and 
houses of the brethren please me exceedingly. And if 
God wanted all monasteries to be like this, all parish 
lords, cities and countries would be well helped and 
advised. Please forgive me, E. W. will know how to keep 
this in a Christian and respectable way, considering that 
they are neither harmful to the parish priest, nor to the 
parish, but almost useful and better. Hereby commanded 
by God. Date Wittenberg, ultima Januarii anno

By the grace and providence of God Almighty, almost 
from the beginning of our University in Wittenberg, in 
the time and government of the Highborn Prince, our 
dear brother Duke Frederick, Elector, in felig 
memory, and subsequently us, as the prospective 1) 
reigning Elector, at the same our University with 
reading in the Holy Scriptures, preaching, and 
preaching of the holy Gospel and the divine Word, as 
well as with the arrangement of the Christian 
ceremonies in the churches through the visitation in 
our lands and principalities, God the Almighty has 
now for a long time sufficiently endeavored to praise 
and honor, also comfort and salvation of the people, 
as he still does daily and without ceasing, so that we 
are not unreasonably inclined to him with special 
graces: In consideration of all this, and from our own 
motive, we have unsolicitedly granted to the above- 
mentioned Doctor Martin Luther, Katharina, his 
married wife, and their heirs, sons and daughters, the 
new dwelling in our city of Wittenberg, which was 
previously called the Black Monastery, in which 
Doctor Martinus has been accustomed for some time 
and still, with his understanding and extent, together 
with the garden and courtyard in front of it, has not 
excluded anything from it, but to all intents and 
purposes he now owns, uses and holds the same 
house, to a right free inheritance, and has gifted and 
graced them with it. 2) To him, his wife and their 
heirs, sons and daughters, to bequeath the above- 
mentioned dwelling, and to be gifted and pardoned 
with it, in and by virtue of this letter, so that they now 
own, possess and use the same dwelling as their 
own property and estate, and may act and act as with 
their own free inheritance and property of their own 
liking and will without our, our heirs' and male entry 
and prevention, but Doctor Martinus, his wife nor 
their heirs or devisees, sell or give the dwelling in 
question to no one, they have then such, and if they 
would be willing to sell it, have previously indicated 
to us or our heirs, whether we or our heirs would like 
to bring such dwelling to us ourselves for such 
payment or other reimbursement, if another would do 
it for them, or grant it to the council of Wittenberg, as 
the occasion may arise, so that it would be of use and 
convenience to the city, give also to the many-named 
Doctor and his married housewives out of special

dwelling touched by our city of Wittenberg during both 
their lifetimes, so that they may not do or maintain 
any projectile or other duty, as the names may have, 
thereof, and shall nevertheless be free and hereby 
permitted by us that they may brew, malt, donate, 
keep cattle and engage in other civic activities like 
other of our citizens and inhabitants of Wittenberg. 
Likewise, their heirs and descendants shall also be 
permitted, completely without hindrance, but in such

To Veit Dietrich in Wittenberg. 


From the Electoral Court, Luther calls for intercession for the 
sick Elector, on whom an operation had been performed. He 
complains of indisposition, but is busy thinking about the preface 
to the prophets. 


From Luther's handwritten original in the royal library at 
Munich, De Wette, Vol. IV, p. 340. The letter is written extremely 
illegibly on a half sheet used in haste, the inner page of which 
was ruled with the pen for a completely different purpose. 


To the highly respectable gentleman and man, that is, 
to Veit Dietrich, who can become decan at any 
hour (decanabilis) in the Faculty of Liberal Arts of 
the University of Wittenberg, my extremely dear 
friend 


My greetings! Your prayers seem to be slackening 
with the Prince's illness, my dear Veit, 1) for Christ's sake 
continue to pray. There are many who wish for his death, 
and D. Caspar 2) says that although he brings this 
infernal fire to a halt by cutting off the big toe, that it [does 
not] turn to the width of the upper foot,®) nevertheless it 
must still be cut in depth, and it was cut today with great 
agony, so that the prince cried out: "It truly presses me 
hard. It must certainly be an evil thing, as you say." He 
does not know that the big toe and part of the bone have 
been cut off, but he thinks that skin or flesh has been cut 
away. If the fire were to penetrate further into the foot, it 
would be over this head, and in a short time. "It is 
certainly the infernal fire" and the breath of Satan himself. 
For D. Caspar assures that 


1) De Wette brings as the reading of the original: M. Phil. and 
has the note: "L. addresses the letter in thought to Melanchthon 
(?)." We have assumed mi Vite. 

2) Lindemann. 

3) We recognize ourselves that this translation is not quite exact. 
For those who are able to reproduce it better, we put the Latin 
text here: D. Gaspar dicit sistere se (?) quidem ignem istum 
infernalem praeciso pollice majoris pedis in latitudinem 
vergendo, sed etc.. We believe to have hit the meaning. 





through this disease, the limbs become ashes while 
alive. 

| am going around with a preface to the prophets. But 
before breakfast, | die daily from dizziness and plague of 
Satan, so that | almost despair of living and returning to 
you. After breakfast | comfort either the prince or others. 
"The head doesn't want to do it anymore. Therefore think, 
if | die, that you need your art and eloquence in the 
preface." Here | cannot accomplish anything, at home | 
would perhaps be happier; therefore | am thinking of 
returning with D. Brick if | can, although the journey is 
suspicious to me. But [tell both the] astr[ologist] and the

himself humble according to the gospel, and did and 
suffered all things. Therefore, think how often we have

been lost: so now attack yourself here, and do not lack

About the filling of the position of Melchior Mirisch, about the 
illness of the Elector and about a marriage case. 


From Aurifaber's unprinted collection, p. 150, in Schitze, vol. 
Il, p.259 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 355 f. 

Grace, and peace! | have been silent for a long time, 
my dear Amsdorf, but the illness of my head was the 
cause of it, which prevented me from any occupation with 
writing, reading and teaching for more than a whole 
month. As you recently wrote about getting a pastor to 
take the place of Melchior Mirisch, and thinking of our 
Hausmann, | think of it this way: that M. Georg, the 
deacon of our church, could not easily be moved to 
change his position; what M. Hausmann's opinion is, | will 
find out. M. Leonhard Beier 1) is also here, who has been 
dismissed from Guben, or rather has left. One of these 
two seems to me to be most suitable for you. | also 
believe that you know M. Leonhard. But because he is 
wanted as a preacher at Zwickau, and here at 
Wittenberg, if Pommer does not return, he will be 
appointed for a time as a deputy in his place, then 
because Schneeberg wants to have M. Hausmann, after 
the contract is concluded (for it has been agreed that 
Schneeberg will become ours, and all articles are agreed 
between the princes, except that of the so-called mixed 
fiefs, all of which is being worked on. When that is 
established, everything is even, even with the approval of 
Duke George. This | have heard from the Prince's own 
mouth, from D. Brick and Riedtel with these my ears and

with Melanchthon. 


Luther warns them not to force the brothers to leave their 
community and go to that of the city. They should also be left in 
their home, property and administration, and not be deprived of 
their parish rights, which would make them guilty of interfering 
with a foreign authority.

indicated at length the reasons for which you have 
considered that they should not hold their own 
communion; they have also indicated that it is not in the 
minds of the preachers and the city to act so that they 
should leave their dwelling and habitum. Now, if you 
could arrange the matter in a friendly manner, without 
coercion, harassment or force, so that they would also 
want to go to your and the entire city's Communion, it 
would be fine and well done, and would set an example 
for many others. As we have written to them, so far, 
however, that you also encumber them in their dwelling, 
goods and administration, and you have no right to err 
them; but where the friars want to keep their own 
communion, and by friendly action do not go to your 
communion, our concern is that you should not force or 
compel them in any way to leave their communion, 
because they do not keep it contrary to the Gospel. For it 
is public that they have parish rights, as there are often 
many parishes in a city; nor does it follow that every 
citizen should therefore set up a parish in his house, for 
no one is permitted to do so; besides, there is a great 
difference between a common and a public assembly, 
and between a household; for what a citizen does in his 
house is called acting secretly. Further, know ye, as the 
understanding 


to inspect the goods of the monasteries and to write them down]. 
De Wette has as a caption: "To the monastery lords of Herford" 
and notes: "They had the administration of the monastery 
estates. Bretschneider has as a superscription: Hervordensibus 
and to the "nine men" the note: Praefectis Monasterii [the officials 
of the monastery]. These headings and explanations are more or 
less inaccurate; the monastery or abbey of Herford, although 
located in the city itself, was an imperial dominion under the 
government of the abbess, who had a seat and a vote in the 
imperial diets. The monastery of the Brothers of the Common Life 
was also subject to her jurisdiction, and the city of Herford had no 
authority over them, as can be seen from this and other letters. 

2) The envoys were M. Rudolf Méller, Rector of the school in 
Herford, and Heinrich Potgeter (Burkhardt).

We urge you not to reach into other people's heads, but 
since they are not your subjects, you are not to force or 
coerce them. This is our advice and request that you 
understand it most kindly from us; we also ask that you 
consider that time itself will find advice. They are honest 
old people, who should be spared, and as the wise, do 
not allow anyone to do wrong to them, for God also has 
people among them, whom he takes care of. We are

Hail! Men of high esteem! We send you a copy of the 
letter we wrote to the nine men (Novembiros), in which 
we absolutely admonish them from violent attacks; we do 
not concede them any right over your goods or bodies or 
order. We have also clearly indicated that you can 
maintain a parish of your own, having both the doctrine 
of the Gospel and customs consistent with the Gospel. 
Therefore, according to our advice or opinion, no one will 
force you to change anything in your order; but still we 
have added that we would write [to you] because of the 
community. For example, it would be useful for you to 
use the fellowship of the rest of the church, and if you did 
so, the whole church would seem to be in harmony.

The matter seems to be settled. Perhaps you would also 
attract many citizens, who are still averse to the gospel, 
to the gospel by your example. Nor do we want you to 
change your clothes or leave your present way of life. 
Therefore, you will have to judge whether you want to 
follow the citizens in this matter. For we by no means 
think that you should be forced, and we have clearly 
approved of your customs, as far as we are able to judge 
from your booklet 1). Therefore, if you prefer to keep your 
parish, we do not disapprove. About the clothing and the 
possessions of the monastery, about your entire 
administration, we make this statement: These things are 
entirely in your hands. For the city has no dominion over 
you, and we will never be the instigators for anyone to 
take possession of foreign things. But if, moreover, your 
citizens should do anything in this matter, we ask that 
you answer in a gentle manner. Be well. On the day after 
Jubilate Sunday [April 22] 1532. 

Two gold florins, which you gave to the messenger as 
a gift for us, we have returned to the messenger, so that 
he may deliver them to you again. For we were not at 
liberty to accept them because of the talk of ungodly 
people, but we did not despise your goodwill toward us. 
But we did not want to give slanderers an opportunity to 
revile. Again, farewell.

Letters from the year 1532. no. 1899. 


1749 





In the case that one would deal with a decency or 
external and secular peace in the German nation, it is to 
be considered well that one will look for much condition 
and entanglements to hem in this part, depending on the 
Confession, and to prevent the doctrine. Now we cannot 
cover all their intrigues. However, it can be assumed from 
the above actions that they will seek these three things, 
namely, that we will not send preachers to other 
dominions or promote the doctrine in such places in any 
way. This article is against God, for, as Paul says, the 
gospel shall not be bound. This is one of the most noble 
services, to spread and promote Christian doctrine and 
right services where one can, especially with such 
measures, with preaching and sending preachers, 
without forcibly taking precedence. And this does not 
require any disputation at all, this article cannot be 
accepted. 

On the other hand, they may seek to prevent anyone 
from accepting mail into the covenant. Although making 
covenants for such Christian help is divine and right (for 
every ruler, even without a covenant, owes and is 
obligated to help the other faithfully in such a case, as is 
easily explained and proven, and 1 John 3:16.” is written: 
"By this love is known: as Christ gave his life for us, so 
we also ought to give our lives for the brethren"). But we 
see that so much unfaithfulness is involved in covenants 
that we cannot expect much help or comfort from them. 
Therefore, each one sees what he owes for himself. A 
pious Christian gentleman cannot undertake to help 
another in such a matter. This is spoken of his own and 
private help. This does not concern the covenants, for he 
cannot comfort anything from foreign, unfaithful covenant 
partners. Therefore, if the others want to take the 
covenant and thus forget love and do not help others, a 
pious and faithful covenanter cannot force them to do so, 
and is therefore excused, if he also tolerates invitations, 
that others are not accepted, for how can he force the 
others to provide help? 


1) In the editions: "John 3." 





Therefore, we know nothing else about this article, 
except that in this case the relatives are diligently 
reminded that they owe help. But if they will not help in 
earnest, what is the point of promising much comfort, and 
no protection follows after that. Christ knew well the 
unfaithfulness of the world, therefore he said of 
preaching, and wants us to command the danger to God. 
He does not let his church perish, says nothing about 
covenants and the loyalty of great kings and princes. 2) 
So we may also command our danger to God, but we 
should nevertheless admonish the rulers, remind them 
and point out to them that they are obliged to protect 
pious Christians, as the Psalm says: "Blessed is he who 
takes care of the wretched. 3) If people from foreign 
dominions go to cities or countries where the holy gospel 
is preached, the authorities there are obliged to protect 
them against unjust violence. 

Thirdly, the Chamber Court is not to agree in any way 
that they should have the power to process against the 
present or others, who would accept the Christian 
doctrine in the future, because of the doctrine or other 4) 
matters concerning the church order with doctrine or 
goods. For this is public, that the Court of Appeal is a 
completely secular court, and has nothing to judge about 
doctrine and church appointment. Moreover, it is public 
that they are most vehemently opposed to us. 

Wherever they want to seek restitution, our concern 
is that the lords are obliged to bring the church goods into 
proper use, to provide their parishes, schools and 
hospital properly. They should do this and keep to it. 
However, if they want to give it to the pope or otherwise 
kill it without benefit, we cannot prevent that. 
Nevertheless, we want to 


2i In this regard, Luther himself noted in the margin (in Latin): 
"That is, he does not promise that they will be faithful as He is, 
but he promises that he will stand by them when they have kept 
the covenants they have entered into, as he has done in the 
whole law." 

3) Luther's marginal note (again in Latin): It is something else 
to say, "Let the kings do it. 

The first part is uncertain, of which Philip speaks; the other part 
is certain, of which Philip does not speak.

1) In Cod. Goth. itis noted: This he said to Franz Koler in 1532, 
June 8, who, together with other exiles, was ordered by Duke 
George either to sell their goods or to stand before the bishop on 
3 Sundays, dressed in white cloths, in church and to recant; and 
after that they were to be absolved. They wrote, however, that 
they would rather let their goods go than Christ, and would rather 
plunge the body into a short lack than the soul into eternal 
torment.

My head's condition was to blame for this, which is 
gradually improving through your prayers; for | despaired 
of the natural powers. | hear that you too are ill, and | do 
not like to hear it. May Christ also restore you and keep 
you for a long time. 

| do not know what | can hope from the peace that is 
to be established between the Emperor and us at 
Nuremberg. Our people have written on their journey 
that the Turk, who has been completely dead up to now, 
is advancing against Germany with a terrifying and 
innumerable army in order to attack Ferdinand and Carl 
at the same time and devour both brothers. The pope is 
in France, and he, together with the king of France, 
denounces the emperor, and they refuse help against 
the Turk. Behold the monstrosities of this time! This is 
the money that the popes have collected for so many 
years against the Turks through indulgences. It is said 
that the emperor is pressuring the princes for the 
promised troops against the Turks. For this reason, the 
Diet may soon be dissolved and the peace negotiations 
broken off. It is said that Carlstadt has traveled again to 
Friesland and is looking for a hiding place, since he can 
have no other position in Switzerland than to engage in 
agricultural work; he soon became tired of this 
agricultural work in our country. This is what we have in 
the way of news. May the Lord do what is good in His 
eyes; | commend you to His grace, Amen. June 13

To the City Council of Soest. 


After the two preachers in Bremen recommended by Luther to 
the council of Soest had refused the appointment, the council 
wrote again to Luther in the beginning of January (regest in 
Kolde's Analecta, p. 178) and asked for Johann de Brun, to whom 
Luther had drawn their attention in your letter of April 30. Now 
Luther reports that he had managed to get him to agree, and 
recommends him warmly. He warns against the false teacher 
Johann Campensis.

To the honorable and wise, mayors and councillors of 

the city of Sofft, my kind 

stigen friends. 

Grace and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Honorable, wise, favorable lords and friends! After you 
have shown such diligence to order your churches well 
and Christianly, | have also gladly served you in this, to 
the praise of God, and have had a special joy in the fact 
that you take up this Christian cause so seriously; may 
our Lord Christ grant grace to this. And at your request, | 
have acted with Mr. Johanne de Brun, so that he will 
come to you and let himself be used, where you want to 
command him the office of preacher or superintendent 
1). For | have considered this John to be especially 
capable for such an office, because of his honest life and 
conduct, as well as his doctrine; for he is well taught and 
practiced in Christian matters before others, has also 
preached and governed churches before, and has fought 
hard against unrighteous doctrine and seditious sects, 
such as Anabaptists and the like, who blaspheme the 
Sacrament, revile authority and government; And from 
this | hope that your church will be well appointed and 
provided for by him with God's grace; | also hope that he 
will help to bring peace and unity with the utmost 
diligence, and prevent 2) unchristian doctrine from 
breaking in among you, as he himself knows that a 
preacher is obligated to do all this; so | have also 
earnestly admonished him to do so. But | also asked you 
to keep him friendly and to care for and protect him 
faithfully. For | see that our poor preachers are treated 
badly and unkindly in many places; for this reason many 
more skilled people flee from the ministry. | want you to 
know that preachers have a high and difficult office, 
which we, to the praise of God and to our own 
blessedness, owe to honor, to maintain and to handle. 
Therefore, let this pious man, Johannem de Brun, who 
has offered to come to you, be faithfully commanded to 
you. 

| also hear that there is one among you, called 
Campensis, who is causing a lot of trouble. Now, | am 
told that the same one has

Campensis at Brunswig has been evil in doctrine and life: 
therefore be warned, and prevent that the said 
Campensis does not cause sectarianism or sedition in 
your city. May God graciously preserve you and grant you 
His grace and peace. Dat. Witeberg, Monday after Viti

From the Turkish War; from the Nuremberg negotiations; from 
Eck's expulsion from Bavaria. 


From Aurifaber's unprinted collection, p. 151, in Schutze, vol.

Grace and peace! | commend to you, best Amsdorf, 
Mr. Lucas, appointed pastor of your Knights of St. John. 
| have instructed him that in any matter, if counsel should 
be needed, he will rely on your guidance and reputation. 
Christ be with you, amen. 

We seem to have finally become too certain about the 
arrival of the Turk. God take care of us! although | fear a 
strong scourge for our ingratitude. Apart from that, | know 
nothing of news, except that ours are expected back from 
Nuremberg, completely undone, and after having spent 
effort, work, time and money in vain. Fate oppresses the 
pope and his kingdom by the angry and unforgiving wrath 
of God. "Well, well!" their blood be upon their heads, "we 
have done enough." | believe that you have heard that D. 
Eck was expelled from Ingolstadt and its territory by the 
princes of Bavaria, and he lost the parish and everything 
very suddenly. So they write from Nuremberg. They are 
in doubt and assume (ariolantur) as the cause that he 
was favorable to the Bishop of Passau, the third Duke of 
Bavaria, Ernst, who desires a part of the paternal 
inheritance. Fare well in Christ. Finally, through the 
prayers, | am freed from the dizziness and the sickness 
of the headache, thanks be to God! Amen. On the day of 
St. John the Baptist [June 24] 1532.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear devotees 
and faithful! The Reverend Prince, our friendly dear son, 
Duke John Frederick, has now written to us from Nuremberg, 
among other things, about the action there in matters of faith, 
as you will find enclosed. We send you herewith what has 
been done during the time that our son was in Nuremberg 
by the two Electors of Mainz and Palatinate with his beloved 
and other of our kinsmen, and it is therefore our gracious 
request that you immediately review and consider all of this 
with diligence and report your concerns to us, along with the

The same has the inscription on the back:

dismissed the concern, as can be seen from the following number. 

2) De Wette, who did not know the previous letter, dates it: "In 
Junius"; the Erlangen edition: "in Julius". This concern reached the 
hands of the Elector on June 30 (Burkhardt. p. 205, note 2i. 
Therefore, the date we set according to Burkhardt cannot be doubtful, 
since this expert opinion was sent at the same time as the letters

Letters from the year 


"Bedenken von den entlichen Mitteln." According to the original, 
reported by De Wette, vol. | V, p. 380 and in the Erlangen edition, 
vol. 54, p. 310; in both, no further locations are given. However, 
this writing is also found in the Eisleben edition, vol. Il, p. 311; in 
the Altenburg edition, vol. V, p. 1025; in the Leipzig edition, vol. 
XX, p. 375; in Walch, vol. XXI, 175- and in the Erlangen edition 
(as a duplicate, where, according to Walch, the locations are 
printed), vol. 65, p. 222. 

We have diligently read and considered all the 
writings sent to us against one another, and especially 
the final remedies and the counter writings. As much as 
we can understand from it, after we have also previously 
examined the Schweinford Act, we know of no article to 
dispute except the third, which states: "that Saxony and 
its fellow citizens and the other states of the empire shall 
not be a party to the other subjects" 2c. For if this article 
is to be understood in such a way that an ecclesiastical 
person or other person who goes to a place of this part 
without the permission of their sovereignty is not to be 
accepted and protected, it would be_ especially 
burdensome for the poor people who come to us from 
foreign dominions; in addition, it would be very 
dangerous for the sovereignty of this part. However, if the 
Emperor is serious about making peace, we take care 
that the measure in this article is easily maintained, as it 
is set by our part of Schweinfurt. 

From the first article, from these words: "and others, 
as will happen in the future" 2c. - we have previously 
indicated our intention, 1) that these words are not to be 
disputed, or that peace is to be rejected for this reason, 
if this annex is not granted; we also do not yet know how 
to change our opinion. For how can we force the emperor 
to secure his people to our liking? We cannot force him 
to secure us, but it is a mercy from the sovereign. 

Item, it is certain that we will not obtain this 
attachment. For how could it be hoped that Duke George 
would suffer, if Leipzig accepted our teaching, that he 
would have to secure it? 

Knowing then that [it] is a vain thing, and hinders 
peace and much good, and that we are not guilty of 
contending: we know not how to advise otherwise, but 
that peace may be kept on account of this article. 


1) St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 1826. 


1532. no. 1908. 1909. 1757 
do not want to reject. And whether some may have 
written or advised differently, as we have heard, we let 
them answer for their opinion. It may also be that some 
people do not have the breath for peace. 

The other pieces, as of the word Zwinglisch, of the 
Concilio 2c. - are pugnae verborum, as any 
understanding person can well accept. 

Item, which is to be held against the Zwinglian outside 
of the article of the sacrament, we mean, that has its 
measure: they are secured, if they hold and accept our 
confession in this. 

Item, from the Jurisdictio we see completely for a 
Cavillation, that against it is indicated, so the Jurisdictio 
should stand as now and. Because we are now and for 
this reason challenged, it follows that we would 
henceforth also be challenged for this reason 2c.: this is 
a sophistry. For in the means it is clearly expressed that 
the litigation at the covenant and Rotweil 2c. should have 
been resolved on that account. 

Preaching in the camp is not as difficult as it seems. If 
the text of the Gospel is preached, then it will not go off 
exactly; one will be allowed to say a saying of Paul and 
an explanation from Scripture, which is not inappropriate 
to the text of the Gospel according to Christian 
understanding. 

In sum, as much as we understand, the finite means 
are well to suffer and accept, where the point of 
acceptance of strangers 2c. would be somewhat 
declared; as we then hold that the same point has not 
great a/sputatio. We may nevertheless also consider 
what kind of driving is involved, if peace is offered to us, 
and we do not want to accept it. We just see to it that we 
do not tempt God, also it is easy to assume that 
something else is behind it. For the Cavillationes are so 
sought after that one can easily notice that other things 
are meant.

without this, | still ask, for the sake of abundance and loyal 
concern, that E. F. G. will not be moved by such pointed 
punctilians 1) but will continue as they have begun; for 
God greets us and it is time for us to thank Him, as the 
Scripture of St. Paul [2 Cor. 6, 2] says: "Do not accept the 
time of grace and the day of salvation in vain. | fear that 
if we let such an occasion go to establish peace, it will 
never again seem so good to us. For this is what the 
saying says: the occasio is full of hair in the front of the 
head, but bald in the back, and stands on a ball 2c.; as

to us, worthy men, that Georg Wicel (Wiselium) is 
applying for a position there in Erfurt, 3) or at least is 
looking for a place to pour out his poison, which he had 
to consume in himself while he was with us. It is an old, 
quite satanic hatred against us, by whose service he 
himself received life, and in our bosom this serpent was 
nourished, until, having deceived the prince with his lies, 
he went away to spread the slobber of his hatred, which 
had long been gathered, elsewhere against us. Perhaps 
also our Lang, to whom | wrote before about him, has 
indicated something to you; certainly Jonas,” as | 
believe, has painted this monster for you. Believe these 
and me. | write this to you as faithful servants of Christ, 
whether you might be able to persuade your authorities 
and all good people not to allow this pernicious poisonous 
snake (viperae). Believe me, if you have ever believed 
that Luther taught something true about Christ, that he is 
an apostle of Satan, who, as an obstetrician, lets us see 
that Campanus, 5) and more un-

lords and friends. 

Grace and peace of God in Christ. Noble, honorable, 
strict, honorable and wise, especially favorable lords and 
friends! We have sent over the church order and the 
order of the visitation, which is to be unanimously and 
uniformly adopted and established in the lands and 
principality of the noble, highborn prince and lord, Mr. 
George, Margrave of Brandenburg, and also in your 
lordship and territories of Nuremberg, In order to avoid 
inequality in doctrine and also in some _ external 
ceremonies, we have diligently read them everywhere 
and, as far as possible at present, have found that they 
do not, in sum, contradict the divine word and agree with 
our order of visitation; we are therefore pleased with 
them. However, in some articles, which you have also 
partly mentioned, such as the ban, how it is to be used 
and carried out, and some other things, you will hear our 
reservations in the enclosed writings. You will know how 
to consider and consider these things in a Christian way, 
according to opportunity and necessity, so that the pure 
doctrine and sermon are preserved and Christian 
ceremonies can still be performed without abuse, for the 
sake of unity and good order. For although the course of 
time is so swift everywhere now, that the church 
ordinances cannot be drawn up and ordered so quickly 
everywhere according to necessity, nevertheless, in 
order to preserve pure doctrine, Christian outward 
discipline and conduct, and to prevent a great deal of 
incorrectness, one must improve on them daily, until the 
Almighty grants more peace and unity in both church and 
world regimes. And with what we can serve you in such 
Christian works and the like, we want to do this to the 
best of our ability. Date Witteberg, prima Augusti anno

V6m Bann. 

(1) We have erected no other ban at this time, except 
that those who practice public vices and do not abstain 
from them shall not be admitted to the sacrament of the 
body and blood of Christ; and this can be maintained by 
the fact that no one shall pass the holy sacrament among 
us unless he has first been interrogated by a priest or 
deacon. Nor can we see how another ban should be 
erected at this time, for there are many things that require 
cognizance beforehand. Now we cannot see how the 
cognitio is to be ordered and arranged at this time; so 
the secular authorities do not want to have anything to do 
with this cognitio. Therefore, let it remain that those who 
lie and remain in public vices are not given the holy 
sacrament. And although the world is now so raw and 
wild that it does not hurry to the sacraments and 
churches, so that this may not be considered a 
punishment, if someone excommunicates himself, let it 
go, if the worldly authorities allow public vices. But 
nevertheless, the preachers should punish such pagan 
behavior and life in all seriousness in their sermons by 
telling of divine urging,’) and thereby admonish the 
potostates to ward off such pagan behavior. . 

If the discipline were to be established again with the 
preceding interrogation before the cognitio, as would be 
very useful and good, then one could easily come to 
establish a discipline and punishment, to keep the 
parents to drive their child and household to the 
sacrament and churches, to prevent the young people 
from falling into such pagan contempt of the sacraments 
and all divine things. 

If a public ban should be imposed, the secular 
authorities must nevertheless keep an order with the 
avoidance of the banished person; otherwise, the public 
ban should be a serious example: this would give birth to 
much injustice at this time, especially in large cities and 
regencies. But this ban of ours, in which the sacrament 
is privately forbidden, misleads the

Letters from the year 


A Christian may nevertheless deal with such an exile as 
a pagan, and have other civil fellowship, but that he show 
himself against him and others, that he does not approve, 
nor let him like the ungodly and criminal doctrine or life of 
the exile. 


De sicca missa. 

(2) Concerning the Mass, which is to be celebrated 
without the Sacrament, we very well accept Brentii's 
objection, and also hold that this spectacle should not be 
performed with the sicca missa. For what else would 
this be but a public strong confirmation of the papal 
private masses, by which the people would be stimulated 
to keep much more of the papal private mass and to run 
to it, than before that time. For if people were accustomed 
to keep something of this sicca missa, they would hold 
the private papal mass much higher and more sacred, 
since it is publicly known that the private papal mass is 
an abomination and unrighteous worship. 

3 We mean that the Sacrament is to be kept in the 
Ciborio, and that while it is still the way 1) to keep and 
lock it, it is to be abolished; for sacramentum et 
verdum should be with each other. Thus it is known that 
this sacrament is instituted for the use, and not for the 
purpose of arranging a special service with the piece of 
the sacrament outside of the use and the word. 

In the 57th leaf, about secular authorities who abuse 
their office, it says: whoever keeps himself in power with 
his authority, so that he must be feared if he does right, 
is not a ruler in the sight of God 2c. This paragraph we 
mean that it would be better to omit it, to avoid trouble 
and burdensome adisputatio. For even though the Holy 
Scriptures and secular law teach how one should behave 
against unjust potestat, mala potestas nevertheless 
remains potestas, as every reasonable person knows; 
for if mala potestas should not be potestas before 
God, then subjects would be exempt from all duty 2c. And 
even if one wants to draw these words with a clasp and 
interpretation to a reasonable meaning, then it is still 


1) "Weife" set by us instead of: "Weih" in De Wette and "Weih" 
in the Erlanger. 





. No. 1914. 1915. 1765 


It is better to avoid such disputation by omitting this 
paragraph, which is not necessary here. 

On the 60th leaf the saying Actorum 13 [v. 38] is 
interpreted: Christ has given up the law in the parts that 
do not justify. These words thus read, as if a piece of the 
law, which piece makes just, as also our opponent 
teaches that we are just propter moralia opera. Since 
we now teach, and the truth is, that we certainly please 
God, and it is by mercy alone, not by reason of our works 
or virtues, that they are called what they will, if we trust in 
such mercy as promised in Christ, we consider that the 
same paragraphus is also to be omitted. 

Paul also speaks universally in Hebrew, that 
everything in the Law could not make us righteous; there 
are also moralia included; why would one want to make 
a particularem out of it? 

This order of visitation also seems as if it were not set 
by one, not even at one time, and is often corrected, and 
some pieces are often repeated, as of the confession. If 
it were left to someone other than Mr. Osiander, he might 
bring it into a different order 2c.

By the Grace of God John. Our greeting before. 
Venerable, reverend, dear devotees, councilors and 
faithful! We graciously inform you that for some time 
we have received complaints from the pastors who 
are in our lands and principalities, and that they still 
daily request us to inform them of the hardships they 
face and the other hardships and shortages they 
must endure, namely, that they are despised, injured, 
beaten and imprisoned in part, and in part they are 
not able to cope with what is prescribed for their 
entertainment; In some cases they have no provision 
at all, in others their parish and other goods are stolen 
and taken away, and they are furloughed for no 
particular reason and without any prior knowledge, 
and so on. Thus, against this, it has been indicated 
that the priests are criminal in their doctrine and life, 
as some have been publicly accused and thus found, 
to the extent that they often apply for an allowance 
and more of their income. And whether we are always

punishment those who have rebelled against the 
priests in such a manner with vexations (sic) and 
abuses, or have beaten them to injustice and 
burdened them with imprisonment or otherwise, 
likewise, so that they, the priests, may have their 
necessary care, and not to take or steal anything from 
them or from their parish goods, or, if such happens, 
to grant and give it to them again, not to dismiss them 
without constant causes and prior knowledge, and to 
apply other due dispositions as occasion arises: so 
we nevertheless find that it wants to be little regarded, 
nor lived to the same. Since this causes us no little 
consternation and also weighs on our consciences, 
and we have graciously granted, upon the petition 
(offer) made by the appointed committee of the 
commonwealth, that the visitation be ordered again, 
as we are inclined to do without it; so that our 
permission may be complied with, so that the pastor 
may avoid such and such further complaints as we do 
not doubt, and otherwise these things may be passed 
by God's help through proper ways and order, so that 
as much as possible, arousal may be prevented 2) 
and the holy Gospel may not be reviled by the 
opponents: Accordingly, itis our gracious request that 
you inform us of your concerns, including when, at 
what time, and by whom, at your discretion, the 
visitation is to be ordered and carried out in each 
district of our lands, and that you overlook our 
previous instruction, which you will undoubtedly still 
have with you, whether it is to be changed, reduced 
or increased in one or more articles and in what form, 
and in particular also consider whether, how and in 
what form the uniones and amalgamation of some 
parishes, where this might occur, are to be carried out

aware of it, and in all of this do our pleasing opinion.

Wittenberg. August 19, 1532. 


To an unnamed person. 


Luther tries to strengthen him in his conviction of the Gospel 
and recommends Christoph Strobel to him. 


Printed in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. 479; in the 
Jena edition (1566), vol. V, p. 506 b; in the Altenburg edition, vol.

54, p. 323. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear 
good friend! He Christoffel Strobel 1) has shown me how 
God has blessed you with His spiritual blessing and 
graciously called you to the knowledge of His Son JEsu 
Christ, and has asked me for this writing to you, so that 
your heart may be admonished and strengthened to 
remain firm in the grace of Christ that has begun. 

Since | have allowed myself to be persuaded that such 
a writing of mine should please you, | have gladly done 
so, and | pray to God, the Father of all gifts and strength, 
that He may graciously confirm and strengthen you in the 
work He has begun through His Holy Spirit, so that Satan 
may not weaken you by any trickery or force, nor make 
you weary in leaving God's Word and Kingdom. 

So you see for yourselves that now is a dangerous 
time. Many are deceived by the spirits of the wicked; 
many also fall away, and become weary and cold of the 
grace of God, so that, deceived by Satan with cunning, 
they let themselves think that they are full, can now do 
everything, and have no need, and thus become lazy and 
ungrateful, soon after becoming worse than before. 

Therefore it is necessary for us to watch and to be 
diligent that we remain in the fervor of faith and increase 
daily. May you and all of us be helped by the right and 
only Helper, our dear Lord Christ, amen. Command also 
into your love the good poor Christoffel Strobel, where he 
is in dire need. For this is done to Christ himself, Matth. 
25. in Wittenberg, Monday after Assumpt. Marie [Aug.

1) Christoph Strobel was first at Mutzschen (between Oschatz 
and Grimma) in the teaching post, came from there to Freiberg 
as Duke Heinrich's court preacher and became in 1539 
Archidiaconus in Oschatz, where he died at the beginning of the 
following year. (De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 630, note 4.)

Quite the same content with the previous letter. 

In the same locations as the previous letter. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, good 
friend! He Christoffel Strobel, along with Mr. Ricolao 
Hausmann, has shown me how God has not only blessed 
you temporally, but, which is much better, has also gifted 
you spiritually with love and air for truth and knowledge; 
which | have heard with joy, and | pray to God that He will 
strengthen you in such grace and keep you until His 
future. For now, unfortunately, it has become a perilous 
time because of the evil spirits and false teachers, who 
creep about everywhere, seeking to deceive someone. 
So Satan himself does not celebrate with evil poisonous 
thoughts, by which he wants to weaken or overthrow our 
faith; and our reason is blind to itself, and always resists 
faith, because it does not respect God's word and 
kingdom, but rather hates it, so that our cause must exist 
solely and exclusively in God's power and strength. 

Now | must write briefly, because we are distressed 
about the pious prince's departure from this pitiful valley, 
as is only right. | hereby command you grace in Christ, 
our Lord and Savior, and kindly ask you to let poor 
Christoffel Strobel be in your command, where you can 
be helpful to him; that Christ, as done to Himself, will 
certainly receive this, and | will also thank Him for it, as 
shown to me. At Wittenberg, Monday after Assumpt.

| am not afraid of others, private people, whose faith and 
constancy, as it may be with me, have not so many and 
So great dangers and causes to fear. But Christ is the well- 
known weak King, and yet truly and eternally the almighty 
King, whose works these are; so he does, lives, speaks, 
both in himself and in his members. And when he seems 
ito be ruined, he rises 1) like the morning star, as he says 
to Paul: "My power is mighty in the weak"; therefore, when 
he is weakened, he is all the stronger. This is his way of 
living, acting, ruling. "Nothing will be different there." 
Although our princes seemed to have been completely 
devoured and ruined by the last Diet of Augsburg, they 
have been made more alive and liberated by this very fact, 
Iso much so that they have learned that the Emperor's 
mind has also been changed, and they can see and 
rejoice that the hopes and efforts of the Roman Pontiff 
have become a mockery. Most of all, therefore, most 
illustrious princes, he who has begun his work in his 
hearts 2) will accomplish it; for thus the beginnings of all 
things that are God's are weak, as the fruits are 
insurmountable. The roots of all trees are in the beginning 
thin threads, or rather milk, or something coagulated, and 
lyet they bring forth these beams and trunks, from which 
the so great, heavy masses of houses, ships and works 
are built. Of our own origin it is said in the Book of Job 
[Cap. 10, 10.] that it is a curdling of milk, and yet from this 
curdled milk at last become the mightiest kings on earth,

Grace and peace in Christ! My dear Andrew: Te ne 
cede malis, sed contra auden 
tior ito 1) [Do not give way to evils, stand against them 
boldly]. Thus | reply, though ill, to your letter, in which you 
indicate that you are tired of this Nineveh, which | too (if 
God would not have Christ do the same) look upon with 
disgust. But the day has twelve hours, and our eyes 
cannot see the future. God tempts us in this way. But, 
even if everything turns out badly, this condition of 
people cannot last for three years. Everything is coming 
to a head so much that it forces a change in this state of 
affairs, either for the worse or for the better. If for the 
worse, then we would accomplish nothing by fleeing; if 
for the better, we would accomplish everything by 
staying. | see indeed, when peace will be, how also 
learned men will be dear, and, as Isaiah says Cap. 13, 
12: "dearer than gold". Preachers are wanted daily, and 
they are not available. Even you, if your ninivites do not 
want to, will be forced and called to where they do not 
think, and they will seek the utmost of your finger in your 
place and not find it.

will graciously help her and preserve what he has agreed 
upon and given her before his end, as she has and 
presents a letter sealed by the Schoppen of W6rlitz, but 
is now challenged by his friends, who intend to drive her 
away. Because such property, which 2) at the time of the 
ecclesiastical law could not have died out to the friends 
without special testament, but would have fallen to the 
Officiis 2c., and 3) he wanted to cover his poor children 
with it, so my poor request, E. F. G. wanted to keep the 
said widow and children with such left property, also 
considered that he has finally married them, as he himself 
confessed to me, when | was with E. F. G. at W6rlitz, and 
| gave him the advice, he should invite a table full of 
neighbors to the*) children and reveal such marriage. If 
he has now done so, good; if not, then according to his 
confession, such a secret marriage is not to be 
condemned, because he has confessed it before me and 
my companions.

To the most magnanimous, most noble Prince and 

Lord, Frederick, King of Denmark, Sweden, and 
Duke of Holstein 2c., my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord, who died for our 
sins and rose from the dead for our lives. Most shining, 
most powerful King, most gracious Lord! Let us take hold 
of and see how God is the right and gracious judge, 
because Our Lady would have liked to have peace with 
her cousin, King Christ 2c., have always liked to be at 
peace with their cousin, King Christian, and have always 
given them a glorious victory; and although | know that 
King Christian will recognize this in the best possible 
way, and know how to thank God, and will also use this 
(given) victory against the cousins of King Christian in a 
Christian and humble manner in the fear of God, | am 
nevertheless moved by the misery, or rather the 
mourning of my good Lord King Christian, and also by 
the concern that King Christian might be attacked by 
some people against the imprisoned King Christian. 
might be incited by some people against the captured 
man and be prevented from God's fear: for which reason, 
with this humble and (| hope) useless writing, | have 
taken upon myself to humbly ask and admonish HM the 
King to have mercy on their captured cousin, according 
to the example of Christ, who also died for us, his 
enemies, but we must not die for enemies, but only be 
merciful to them. For where E. K. M. Cousin is not to be 
trusted, but to be treated as an enemy, we are to be 
merciful to them.

E. K. M. would be imprisoned, there is no doubt that K. 
M. would still be cousinly towards him: how much more 
will K. M. do this now, because he has left everything and 
(as | hear) has surrendered as a prodigal son to K. M., 
as his father. Since this is a great humility, and we still 
need mercy before God, K.K.M. will undoubtedly do a 
noble sacrifice and glorious service, where she will also 
show fatherly mercy and fatherly faithfulness to the poor 
captive man, and finally, at the deathbed, such work will 
be a great comfort to K.K.M., and a special joy in heaven, 
as well as a great glory and honor on earth. For it is a 
great work, done in great things and great people, great 
person, that it must shine gloriously both here on earth 
as an excellent example to all the world, and there in 
heaven for the joy of all saints and angels, also for the 
pleasure and delight of the divine majesty. So, my most 
gracious Lord, let E. Let this work be a fruit of faith, a 
glorious sacrifice of thanksgiving to God, a comfort and 
refreshment to the prisoner, and a joy and delight to us 
all: then, at long last, Christ Himself and all those who 
have advised him to do so, will happily give thanks and 
confess how deeply sorry Christ Himself would be if they 
had done otherwise. May Christ, our Lord and Helper, 
give His rich Spirit to E. K. M. in this and in everything to 
do His divine good pleasure, Amen. Please accept my 
presumptuous writing, for this is what God Himself calls 
us to do, and to care for one another. At Wittenberg,

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn 
Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The first Supplication, which 
| have humbly made to E. C. F. G., is the one | made for 
the Paceum 1) orally at Wittenberg. Now | come with the 
other one (because | want to count them, so that | don't 
make too much). | am now talking about the Christian 
Supplication, and is to E. C. F. G. my humble request, 
after the two boys, Hans von Kanitz' sons, 2) blessed, 
have studied almost well at school in Torgau, and have 
turned out well, 3) and their mother can no longer keep 
them there because of poverty, and it would always be a 
pity that such fine boys should come from the studio, 
because one is allowed people; so | still Know well that 
my most gracious lord, blessed 2c., has, at my request, 
had a gracious promise made to these boys that they will 
be graced with an expectation of a prebend. Accordingly, 
| ask once again, E. C. F. G. wanted both of you to praise 
God. 


1) On this Supplication M. Pacaus received the Diaconate at 
Leisnig, but was so badly provided for by this position with his 
wife and six small children that Luther again asked the Elector for 
him on March 9, 1533.

"despite VI, 575". 





Grace and peace in the Lord! That | write to you less 
often, my dear Eberhard, is forced upon me not only by 
the amount of other things to be written and their 
frequency, but also because you are at peace and do not 
need my writing. But since you now show me the sorrow 
of your soul because of the death of your father and the 
unkindness of your mother and the deprivation of your 
inheritance, you must again compare with Job the good 
you have received with the misfortunes that have befallen 
you. Nor are you in such a position, nor is it your will, that 
without Christ you would rather have the favor of the 
father and the mother than in and with Christ the hatred 
of the mother. You will command those people to the 
judgment of God and sing with the Psalm and with 
Joseph [Gen. 41, 51. f.]: The Lord has made me forget 
my father and my father's house in a foreign land. Then, 
what 2) do you know with what end your father has 
departed, or what God has done to him? Furthermore, 
your mother still has twelve hours, and who knows where 
the gospel will come in a short time, since the papists are 
crying out that even the emperor has become a Lutheran, 
because he does not want to rage to increase their 
godlessness. Even if everything turns out differently, you 
can still wish yourself luck that you are snatched like a 
stick from the fire and like an earlobe from the jaws of the 
wolf. Lot had to leave his own wife in Sodom, and David 
lost his beloved Absalom; also Christ the synagogue, and 
Paul the children of Israel, his brothers 2c. Therefore, you 
are not the only one to suffer great evil; others have 
suffered and are suffering even worse. It must also come 
true in some [Matth. 10, 35.]: "I have come to raise up the 
Son against the Father." And you have many such things 
to comfort you. For us the One Christ is enough when we 
have lost everything. May the Lord be with you and with 
all yours. December 12, Anno 1532.

To the City Council of Soest. 
Luther warns again about Joh. Campensis. 


From the original in the city archives at Soest in De Wette, Vol. 
IV, p. 423 and in the Erlangen edition, Vol. 54, p. 344, according 
to an erroneous copy communicated by the preacher Rollmann. 
Also in Grote's Jahrbuch I, p. 170 and in the Soester Wochenblatt 
1826, No. 41. A facsimile is in the Geh. Haus-Archiv in Berlin. We 
have used the good variants of Grote's given by Burkhardt p. 210. 


To the honorable and wise, mayor and council of the 
city of Soist, my favorable lords and good friends. 
Grace and peace in Christ! Honorable, wise, dear 
lords and friends! Next | wrote to you 5) (although by M. 
Philipp's hand, because | could not write with my own 
handwriting due to the dizziness of my head and the 
weakness of my spirit) and faithfully commanded you 
your advisor, Johann Brun, 2c., and also diligently 
warned you against the harmful man Johannes 
Campensis 2c. Now | hear that the same devil-apostle 
should still be with you now and cause misfortune: is 
therefore my heartfelt and Christianly faithful advice, 
want to be diligent that you get rid of the man. There must 
be no complaint nor referral, for his actions are public, as 
he joined in the raving with Melchior Kirschner 6) (called 
Hofmann) in Flensburg. 


3) Here, De Wette has incorrectly placed a punctum. 

4) We were not able to translate this incomplete sentence. 

5) The letter of June 17. 

6) De Wette offers: "Knesner"; arte reads: "Kersner", but the 
original will probably read "Kursner"

Foreword. 


This volume brings the continuation and conclusion 
of Luther's interpretations of the New Testament from 
the detailed explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians to 
the sermons on the Epistle of Saint Jude; also the 
interpretation of many beautiful sayings of sacred 
Scripture, which Luther wrote to some in their Bibles, 
and the short notes, which Luther (after 1530) entered in 
his own hand in his copy of the New Testament. 

Compared to the ninth volume of Walch's old edition, 
this volume appears in a very different form. The shorter 
interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians has been 
assigned to the eighth volume, while the detailed 
explanation has been transferred to this volume, which 
has already been accounted for in the preface to the 
eighth volume. The first number of the appendix in the 
old edition, Luther's "very first exegetical work on the 
Psalms of David," has been omitted from this volume, 
partly because it does not belong to the interpretations 
of the New Testament, and partly because the space for 
it is too limited. 


The second number of the appendix: "The Interpretation 
on Marc. 16, 14-20, ‘Of the Glorious Mandate of Christ" 
also had to be left out. Also the second number of the 
appendix: "The interpretation of Marc. 16, 14-20, "Of the 
glorious mandate of Christ", had to be left out, because 
it is not (as Walch assumed) from Luther, but from Dr. 
Ambrosius Moiban in Breslau. 1) Luther wrote only a 
preface to it. 2) The third number of the appendix, 
Luther's sermon on 1 John 5:4, 5, has been newly 
translated from Latin and inserted at the appropriate 
place. The fourth number of the appendix, "Luther's 
Short Notes on the New Testament," we have not called 
an appendix, because they deserve a place in this 
section just as much as the interpretation of many 
beautiful sayings. 

Besides the earlier "Interpretation on the 1st Epistle 
of St. Peter from 1523", which is printed by Walch, we 
have, because Luther later (in 1539) 3) once again 
discussed this epistle pre

which in De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 432, has the heading: 
"Written in a Bible", we have translated into German and 
used for the first part of Luther's "Short Notes on the New 
Testament”; for that is where this piece belongs. In the 


Erlangen edition, the same is found in the Opp. var. 


arg. VII, p. 555, under the praefationes. Both, the 


Erlangen edition as well as Seidemann, have overlooked 
the fact that it is found twice in Walch, namely vol. IX, 
2774, and vol. XIX, 1774. We, too, only became aware of 
Walch's duplication of this piece during the editing of this 
volume, and have already included it in our edition, vol. 
XIX, 1460. There it should have been omitted. 

We have newly translated the great interpretation of 
the letter to the Galatians. We have to talk about it a little 
more in depth here, because the words used in the old 


Translation of Menius. 


As Hosea Cap. 13 it is written that one death strangles another; for 
so says the prophet v. 14: "Death, | will be a death or poison unto thee; 
hell, | will be a plague unto thee." But the death that strangles the other 
is the right life. But the prophet needs such a speech precisely because 
of the great indignation and anger against death, which so cruelly tears 
away and devours all the world; and he would not be able to defy death 
in this way, "Death, | will be your death or poison," if his heart were not 
full of the Holy Spirit, through whom he sings out enlightenment with all 
joy and gladness, and says that Christ's death has overcome the death 
that the devil has brought into the world. 





VII 


Luther himself recognized Menius's translation, which 
was printed in the second edition, by including it in the 
first volume of his collected writings (1539). 

Although Menius' translation shows that he had the 
German language well under his control, it cannot be 
denied that it suffers from various deficiencies that make 
a new translation appear desirable, namely: ' 

In many cases Menius did not give a translation, but 
a paraphrase of the Latin, e.g. in Luther's preface, which 
in our translation is at least a full third shorter than in 
Menius'. 

Several times Menius inserted rhetorical expansions, 
which the Latin text does not offer. To prove this, we put 
a small section here, which forms the second half of 277 
and 278 of the second chapter. 


Our translation. 


Court. 13, 14. "Death, | will be a death to you; hell, | will be a 
pestilence to you." [Vulg.) Thus he [Paul] says here that he died to the 
law through the law, as if to say: The law of Moses accuses me and 
condemns me. Against this accusing and condemning law | have 
another law, which is grace and freedom. This accuses the accuser 
and condemns the condemning law.

After that St. Paul speaks Rom. 8, 3.: "God sends His Son in the

likeness of sinful flesh and has condemned sin by sin." Makes two kinds But he is called the death of death because of the exceedingly great 
of sin; as the prophet makes two kinds of death. But the sin that unwillingness of the Holy Spirit against death. Thus, righteousness puts 
condemns the other is right, true righteousness. But St. Paul calls it a on the name of sin because it condemns sin, and this condemning sin 
sin, out of a cheerful heart, which is full of the Spirit and of faith 2c. Item is right righteousness. 


Eph. 4, 8. he takes the 68th Psalm, v. 19, and speaks in the same way, 
saying: "Christ has ascended on high and has caught the prison"; he 
sets prison against prison. In this way he also says here: "He died to the 
law through the law. As if to say, "The law of Moses accuses and 
condemns me; but against this law, which thus accuses and condemns 
me, | have another law, which is grace and liberty: which again accuses 
and condemns that law which wants to accuse and condemn me. 


On a smaller scale, such extensions occur very 
frequently, e.g., Cap. 1, § 36, § 121, z 142; Cap. 2, § 98, 
§ 99, § 303, § 366; Cap. 3, § 217, § 218, § 219, § 377; 
Cap. 6, § 119 2c. Cap. 4, § 1 is spun out by Menius in a 
rambling recapitulation to something over a "columne" 
and a half. At the end of § 240 of the 4th chapter, Menius 
inserts a longer section in which he elaborates on what 
Luther said by an excursus against the enemies of the 
Gospel at that time. In § 296 of the same chapter, what is 
contained in the Latin text is tripled in scope. 

3. Sometimes in Menius the translation shrinks to an 
epitome, e.g. in the last sentence of Cap. 1, § 6; Cap. 2, 
§ 87; Cap. 3, §180; Cap. 6, § 45 and § 66. 


4. Not infrequently, Menius' translation is so free that 
one can hardly recognize any resemblance to the Latin 
original, e.g., Cap. 1, § 179, §180, § 181. Of Cap. 1, § 
180 and Cap. 6, § 14 and § 15, there is almost not a word 
in the Latin. Cap. 3, § 563 is completely changed in 
content. Luther's description of the struggle between law 
and gospel, which was going on within himself, is 
omitted, and commonplaces are inserted in its place. The 
second half of Cap. 3, § 195 is changed entirely. Menius 
also avoids difficulties of the text by inaccurate 
translation, e.g., Cap. 2, § 159. 

5. Here and there, entire pieces are missing, e.g., the 
paragraph which we have added to Cap. 2, §6; a piece 
of Cap. 2, §162 at the end; the beginning of § 222; the 
first half of Cap. 3, § 372. to the end of 


Foreword. 


Cap. 4, § 342 is missing several sentences. What we have called § 52) 
in the 5th chapter is completely missing in Menius. In Cap. 5, § 248, al 
longer section is omitted. About half of Cap. 6, § 8 is missing. The| 
second half of Cap. 6, § 58 is missing in Menius, and in its place other 
thoughts are introduced that recapitulate the previous. 

In contrast, longer sections are inserted elsewhere, none of which 
are in the original Latin, e.g., Cap. 2, § 32, § 218; Cap. 3, § 336, § 337] 
(two full colums); Cap. 3, § 315. How arbitrarily Menius deals with the} 
Latin text, we have a striking example in Cap. 3, 88 372-385. In this 
section, about one columne has been omitted, while two and a half 
columne have been inserted. Most of the paragraphs of this section| 
take up about twice as much space in Menius' translation as in ours. Of 
Cap. 6, § 18 Menius brings less than half, but he has brought 8 19 to} 
more than double. 

7. sections are rearranged, e.g. § 28 and § 29 of the 6th chapter in 
Menius should be designated as § 34 and § 35. 

Sometimes, Menius also has downright wrong translations; e.g. 
Cap. 3, 8 111 he did not realize that the "eulogy" about the justice off 
the law was to be understood ironically. - According to the Latin, Cap) 
4, § 54: "Therefore we have this filiation only through the redemption of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is our abundant and everlasting} 
forgiveness. 





IX 


The first is "service, be it according to equity or dignity" (sive de 


congruo, sive de condigno). That this translation is correct is 
proven by § 58. Menius translates: "Therefore we do not need any 
further merit, neither de congruo, nor de condigno. 

In some places Menius unnecessarily amplifies Luther's 


expressions, e.g. Cap. 2, § 213 he translates homines sine mfente 
by: incomprehensible coarse asses; Cap. 2, § 248 malevolus by: a 
useless spitting bird; Cap. 2, § 378 sophistae arch-villains; Cap. 3, § 
106 commander caeci the blind asses’ heads; Cap. 3, § 211 aliquis 


ineptus a clumsy grobianus. On the other hand, in other places where 
Luther's expression seems too harsh or too bold to him, he softens the 


same, e.g. Cap. 2, § 309 quod Christus sit diabolus meus 


contra diabolum Menius translates: that Christ, the stronger, sees 
and binds the strong. Cap. 3, § 322 according to the Latin: "And indeed 
all the prophets saw this in the spirit, that Christ would be the greatest 
of all malefactors, murderers, adulterers, thieves, robbers of God, 
blasphemers 2c., whose like had never been in the world." Instead 
Menius brings: "And indeed all the prophets foreknew in the Spirit that 
Christ would be the greatest of sinners, the like of which had never 
been on earth." Cap. 5, § 42 seemed to him the expression: "the law 
was a denial of Christ" too harsh, therefore he brought other thoughts 
in the place of Luther's execution. From the-

Anno 1535. 


Newly translated from Latin. 


Justi Menii Foreword. ') 


To the Most Serene, Highborn Prince and Lord, Duke 
of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy 
Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, and 
Margrave of Meissen 2c., my most gracious Lord, 
grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord 
Jesus Christ our Savior. 


Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! 
This past year | have written the interpretation of the 
venerable and highly respected D. Martin Luther, my 
dear Father in Christ, on the Epistle of St. Paul to the 
Galatians, and have translated it by divine grace. Gn. 
Rentmeister, Hans von Taubenheim, has persuaded me 
to do so. 


1) Although we do not bring Menius' translation, but a new one, 
we have nevertheless left Menius' preface, partly because of the 
historical material it contains, and partly because many of the 
thoughts Menius expressed in it have also moved us in the 
preparation of the new translation. 





And | was almost afraid of the food, not only because 
the work was great and heavy, but also because | 
considered my inability and worried that | might either 
have to let what | was about to do fall into disgrace, and 
succumb to weakness, or do it in such a way that it 
would never be done well. And even if | should tell the 
truth and confess it at once, it has been hard enough on 
several occasions, and it would have taken very little for 
me to get stuck with it. However, in the name of the Lord, 
| have again and again strained and continued until, with 
God's help, | have torn through it and reached the end, 
even though it has been hard and difficult enough for me 
to get through. 

And although | have had to spend a good long time 
with it, | have also become tired of the work, writing and 
reading, more than just one; therefore, | would like to 
believe that one or two will also read themselves tired 
before they read it out. However, the manifold, beautiful 
and extremely comforting teachings contained in this 
book have pleased and delighted me so much that | 
have forgotten all boredom and fatigue because of it. 


*) After Luther had already interpreted the Epistle to the Galatians once from 1516-1519 and had his explanation go out in the latter 
year, he began again in the winter semester of 1531-1532 to explain it in his lectures. (Késtlin, Martin Luther, vol. Il, p. 272. Cf. vol. |, p. 291.) 
This second interpretation was copied by Al. Georg Rérer and first published it in 1535 under the title:In epistolam S. Pauli ad Galatas 
Commentarius, ex praelectione D. Martini Lutheri collectus. Vitebergae 1535 2c. At the end: Excusum Vitebergae per Joannem Lufft. This

gabe, Dom. |, p. X, is erroneously 1535.), which was reprinted in Frankfurt by Peter Brubach in 1543 and 1546. This second edition was 
provided by Luther himself with the preface, which we have presented to the interpretation. We do not know whether the first edition of 1535 
was also provided with a preface by Luther, but it is certain that our preface, at least in its present form, cannot belong to an earlier time than 
1538, because of the statements about the antinomians contained therein. (Cf. Kawerau, Agricola, p. 201, note 2.) That which is designated 
in the editions as [liu 6t drevm pruokutio (with the exception of the Latin Wittenberg, which does not contain this superscription) is not a 
"preface," but a "salutation of Luther to his hearers." The 1538 edition is included in the Latin collections of Luther's works: Wittenberger 
(1554), Dorn. V, cog. 2694"; Jenaer (1570), Dom. IV, col. 1; Erlanger, Dom. Justus Menius, then pastor and superintendent at Eisenach, 
translated this interpretation into German. This translation was included in the first volume of the Wittenberg edition, published as early as 
1539; we find no news of an old single edition. This translation is also found in the later editions of Luther's writings: in the Wittenberg edition 
(1556), vol. |, p. I; in the Altenburg edition, vol. VI, p. 509; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XI, p. 1. In the last century, two individual editions of the 
same text appeared, namely one, without indication of the place, in 1717, organized by Samuel Lucius, preacher at Ansoldingen in the Canton 
of Bern; the other at Halle in 1737, published by |. G. Walch. A reprint of Walch's text review was published in 1856 in Berlin by Gustav 
Schlawitz. A French translation of the larger commentary appeared in Antwerp in 1583 by Arnoult Conink under the title: Declaration entid5re 
des fondemens de la Doctrine Chr“tienne, faite par Martin Luther sur VEpistre de St. Paul aux Galatiens, en laquelle est contenue une vraye 
et parfaite Exposition de la Justification, qui est par la Foy en Jesus Christ. Nouvellement revue, curieusement corrig*e et augment’e (suivant 
le Latin) de ce qui est6 [etait] obmis en I'Impression Francoise auparavant mise en Lumiere. The earlier French edition to which this title 
refers may perhaps be that which appeared at Geneva in 1564. In the Erlangen edition, Dom. I, p. XII, 8nl" Xo. IX of the editions of the 
Commentaria major, a Spanish translation is also given, but this is a translation of the smaller Commentary. Christian Friedrich Borner, the 
editor of the Leipzig edition of Luther's works, reports in the preface to Volume Il, p. 28, that he has an English translation, which was printed 
in London in 1635. The approval of the Bishop of London, Edwin Sandys, was added to this edition, which was before the first English edition 
of 1575. Instead of the many praises given to this main writing of Luther (he himself calls it his best work, Limi86i1, ooUohuia, Dom. Ill, p. 
196), we only add the words of Menius from his preface: "If there were no other doctrine of godliness, no consolation nor admonition on earth, 
but this few epistles alone, so understood and considered, that nevertheless the whole world would have enough and enough of all kinds of 
godly doctrine and consolation. We have re-translated according to the Wittenberg edition. 





4 Justi Menii Foreword. 


W. vm, isis-E 5 





The main article of Justification, that is, which teaches 
how one must become righteous and blessed before 
God through the one faith in Jesus Christ alone, without 
the help of all kinds of laws and works, is emphasized 
and explained in the most powerful, abundant and 
comforting way, and in contrast, all the most prominent 
ungodly errors of the papal sophists and monks are thus 
overthrown by God's Word, and monks are thus refuted 
and overthrown by God's word, so that in the 
consciences and hearts of all pious, right-minded 
people, such devilish lies and blasphemies against the 
divine eternal truth must melt, dissolve and fly away, no 
differently than how the snow melts away from the sun, 
and the light chaff is scattered by the mighty wind: | 
nevertheless hope that | will have done so much in this 
interpretation, with my possible diligence, that such 
comforting articles of the Christian doctrine, as those 
dealt with in the interpretation, should be understood in 
good measure. 

The loose junk of the sophists, school slaves and 


monks, de merito congrui et condigni; de gratia 
gratificante et gratum faciente; de fide acquisita et 


infusa, formata et informi; de qualitate inhaerente, and 
whatever else they have slurred, | do not know myself 
whether | have understood it correctly, or whether | have 
delivered it, and | take it for granted that among them the 
majority slur such words, like parrots and parakeets, 
without any understanding, and do not know themselves 
whether they are cut or stung. For it is such a hopeless, 


insolent slobber that, like a hut smoke or an assa foetida, 
it neither wants to be ingested nor reproduced; both of 
the things and words are almost such a theologia, as 


Constantini's donatio is a jurisprudence. For the things 
on both sides are in themselves vain lies and deceit, 
what the emperor Constantinus is supposed to have 
given to the pope of the empire, and what the sophists 
and monks promise to give to the poor consciences by 
their lies and alfalfaism in the kingdom of heaven. 

In addition, there is such Latin on both sides, which, 
except for such gypsies, has never been used anywhere 
else in the whole world. And just as such theologians 
have a peculiar spirit (not of light nor of truth, but of 
darkness and lies), so they also speak with peculiar new 
tongues, not the great, glorious deeds of God, but only 
dark, incomprehensible, yes, outrageous and 
inexperienced lies and blasphemy of their pope and 





devil out of hell. But | will take care, it should also be 
almost met and given so that whoever wants to pay 
attention to the things and think about them, he should 
also be able to understand it quite well. For whoever 
wants to take up strange, unknown things anew and 
learn to understand them, must also be accustomed to 
strange, new words and speeches. 

However, no matter how it may be spoiled, | will 
nevertheless attribute such book to Your Lordship. Gn., 
and let it go out under the same name, because it is 
already owned by Ew. Gn., therefore, that it has been 
published by the above-mentioned my dear Lord, v. 
Martinum, in Ew. Gn. hochldébliche Universitat zu 
Wittenberg, and by the well-learned, pious, diligent man, 
M. Georg RGérern, has been most faithfully compiled, and 
thus brought together in this book. Therefore, | also fear 
that | am doing wrong and evil, and that | am doing Your 
Grace an injustice. Gn.'s honor, if | were to publish such 
a book other than under Your Honor's auspices. Gn. 
name. Just as Magister George, along with others, 
would also do wrong and evil if they kept such precious 
and noble treasures, of which they admittedly still have 
a great deal and are delicious, hidden among 
themselves and did not also communicate them to the 
other Christians. 

Moreover, | also think that at this time no one is so 
much in need of this and similar books, and to read them 
diligently, as Ew. Gn. For although there is no doubt that 
all Christian hearts at all times need to be comforted and 
strengthened with God's word against the devil without 
ceasing, and there is no one who can arm himself too 
well against such a powerful and malicious enemy, it is 
certainly true, and can never be lacking, that the evil- 
doer of Ew. Gn. must be especially mortally hostile 
before all others, therefore that Ew. Gn. not only publicly 
profess the Christian truth for their own person with other 
believers in Christ, but also that in their lands and 
principalities, and even in their school and church at 
Wittenberg, the church and the school of the Church of 
the Holy Spirit have been established. Gn. school and 
church at Wittenberg, such comforting, wholesome 
teachings of the Holy Gospel have initially arisen, and 
our dear Lord Jesus Christ has planted, cherishes and 
adorns His most holy kingdom of grace in such beautiful 
peace, good order, in the most blessed way. 

And so, that like a beautiful, wholesome, fragrant 
balsam garden, it now spreads to other principalities, 
yes, even to foreign nations and mighty kingdoms, with 
its wholesome good 


6 Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1518-1521. 7 


The stench is spreading, and in the same foreign 
nations, kingdoms and countries innumerable poor, 
miserable consciences, who in their sins under God's 
wrath would otherwise have had to despair and perish 
utterly for eternity, are now thus refreshed and 
refreshed, that the blessed knowledge of the great 
graces and benefits of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, as if 
raised from the dead to life, yes, as if from the abyss of 
hell, where they had been truly imprisoned under the 
cursed, unholy pabstium, now leads them _ into 
Abraham's bosom, into the heavenly paradise and to 
eternal bliss. 1) And is such a comforting, wholesome 
teaching of the holy gospel ever a right good smell of life 
to the poor, miserable conscience. Just as it is also a 
stench of death unto death to all the ungodly and the 
damned, but especially to the accursed ministry, which 
is truly the real kingdom of sin of the Antichrist, of whom 
St. Paul proclaimed [2 Thess. 2:8] that the Lord would 
kill him with the spirit of his mouth; for which reason it is 
no wonder that he again rages and rages against it so 
horribly. 

And there is no doubt that this and other such books 
will testify to eternal times, 2) what we have taught at this 
time from the holy gospel of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, 
both rightly and well, and what we have also challenged 
and rejected in the devilish, damned teaching of the 
counter-Christian papacy (of which they have been, of 
the sophists and monks), and all pious Christian hearts 
will be able to judge and judge from this, that we have 
not done this without necessity, out of frivolous 
presumption, out of ambition, for the sake of money, but 
that a greater and higher thing than the kingdom of the 
world, with all its power and glory, can be and become 
ever more to us than the glory of God, love of truth, and 
our own, together with all other poor Christians’ 
miserable consciences, to save them from eternal 
destruction by God's power, and to help them through 
the true knowledge of Christ to grace and eternal 
blessedness, has moved, yes, forced and urged us to do 
so. 

For although someone may think out of ignorance, or 
out of an envious, hostile heart against 


1) Wittenberger: "auffriiret", a printing error. 
2) Wittenberger: to become a witness. 





to pretend to us that we were so blind and foolish that 
we had initially initiated this trade for the above- 
mentioned reasons: How could we be so mad and 
foolish that we should persist in it and not desist from it, 
after we have learned so grossly and with such great 
miserable sorrow in all the world that with this doctrine 
we will ever gain neither honor nor good, neither favor 
nor some temporal enjoyment before the world, but must 
wait for the antagonism; In addition, to put our life and 
limb, together with wife and children, in all kinds of 
danger, and through the adversary's iniquity and unjust 
judgment, to condemn ourselves as the very worst 
heretics, God's enemies and blasphemers, to the abyss 
of hell, and to make us entirely the devil's own? And such 
a thing should drive away and atone for the presumption 
of one, my mistake. But let each one think, speak and 
write what he wants and how he wants, so we can 
comfort ourselves that our dear Lord Jesus Christ is the 
one who justifies us; who then wants to condemn us? 

Therefore, Most Gracious Sir, Your Lordship. Gn. may 
have this book, along with others like it, especially 
ordered, be very dear and valuable to you, so that, since 
Your Lordship is the most merciful of all, you will be able 
to read and understand it. Gn. have to tolerate more than 
one kind of challenge from the devil and his larvae every 
day, you may see from this book in every way and take 
comfort in the fact that such things are and will be 
inflicted on you by the devil and his kingdom, the 
damned world, for no other reason than solely for the 
sake of God's holy word and the poor Christian souls' 
eternal salvation and blessedness. Therefore also our 
dear God and Father in heaven, for the sake of His only 
dear Son, our dear Lord and Saviour JEsu Christ, Ew. 
Gn. in all such temptations and adversities against all 
kinds of tyranny, guile and evil treacherous practices of 
the adversaries, and will preserve them with all glory. 
Therefore all the pious God-fearing and Christ-believing 
hearts, who have been saved by such salutary teachings 
to grace and salvation from the cruel kingdom of 
darkness in the counter-Christian papacy, all over the 
world, without ceasing from the bottom of their believing 
hearts, most sigh, ask and plead most earnestly, amen. 

So it has come to me that | have done it with the 
interpretation and have served pious God-fearing 
Christians with it, who should, next to

8 Lri. 6-u. i, 3f. 


God, Your Lordship. Gn., as those to whom in their 
principalities and lands the holy and salutary Gospel, of 
the grace of our dear Lord JEsu Christ, is graciously 
granted and given by God to have, to honor and to 
promote before other potentates, therefore give thanks. 
If, however, | do not want to swear too much (that it ever 
happens from time to time), and some disgusting, tender 
spirits also want to sharpen their beaks and blame it, 
then | am here, gladly confess my guilt and foolishness, 
also want to bear the shame willingly, and grant them all 
honors from the heart; only that they both, for their own 
honor and for the benefit of pious Christians, may take 
the trouble and work of

will. | therefore ask with all humility that Your Serene

D. Martin Luther's Preface. 
1538.*) 


1) | can hardly believe myself that | have made so 
many words in publicly expounding this epistle of St. 
Paul, as this booklet shows that | have done, and yet | 
perceive that all the thoughts which | find distinguished 
in this writing by the brethren with such great care are 
my thoughts, so that | must confess that | have said all, 
or perhaps more, in this my public discourse. 1) For in 
my heart this article alone prevails, namely, faith in 
Christ, from which, through which, and to which, by day 
and by night, all my theological thoughts flow and flow 
back. Nevertheless, | feel that of the wisdom, which has 
such a great height, breadth and depth, | have only 
grasped a few weak, poor firstlings and, as it were, 
crumbs. 

2 Therefore, | am also ashamed that my so meager 
and cold interpretations [of the Scriptures] of such a 
great apostle and chosen instrument of God are being 
published. However, it compels me to lay aside this 
shame and to be bold without shame, the endless and 
terrifying desecration and abomination that is always 
raging in the Church of God. 


1) Aurifaber has taken the following up to the end of the paragraph 
from the translation of Justus Menius and by the words: "sprach D. 
Mart. Mart." as Luther's speech in the Table Talks, Cap. 7, K 57. In 
our edition of the Table Talks, this paragraph has been omitted. 





and even today does not cease to rage against this 


unified and solid rock, which we call the doctrine (locum) 
of justification, that is, how we have been redeemed 
from sin, death and the devil and given eternal life not 
by ourselves (no doubt not even by our works, which are 
inferior to ourselves), but by the help of others, through 
the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. 

This rock was challenged by Satan in Paradise, when 
he persuaded the first parents to become like God 
through their own wisdom and strength, if they 
abandoned faith in God, who had given them life and 
promised to preserve it. 

4 Soon after that liar and murderer, who can never 
desist from his ways, drove a brother for the sake of this 
article to kill his brother for no other reason than 
because his godly brother had made a better sacrifice 
by faith [Heb. 11:4], and he, as an ungodly man who 
offered his works without faith, had not pleased God. 

5) Then followed an unceasing, unbearable 
persecution of Satan against the same faith by the 
children of Cain, until God was forced to purify the whole 
world at once through the flood and to destroy Noah, the 





*) This time determination results from the contents of the preface. Cf. the note to § 18. 


10 Li-1. 6ai. 1, 4-6. 


Preachers of faith and righteousness (2 Petr. 2, 5.). 
Nevertheless, Satan kept his seed in Ham, the third son 
of Noah. 

But who can tell everything? The whole race has 
raged against this faith by setting up idols and worship 
services of their own choosing, in which each one (as 
Paul says [Apost. 14, 16.]) walked his own way and 
hoped with his works to reconcile one god, another one 
goddess, one many gods, another many goddesses, 
that is, to redeem himself from all evil and sins by his 
own work without the help of Christ, as the deeds and 
writings of all pagans sufficiently testify. 

(7) But these are nothing against the people of God 
Israel or the synagogue, which were gifted before all 
others, not only with the certain promise made to the 
fathers, then with the law given to them by God through 
the angels [Acts 7:53.], but also were continually 
strengthened in the certainty by the prophets who were 
with them, with sermons, miracles and examples: and 
yet the devil, that is, the raging for one's own 
righteousness, had such a continuance among them 
that, according to all the prophets, they themselves also 
killed the Son of God, the Messiah promised to them, 
namely for the same reason, 'because they taught that 
we humans please God, not through our righteousness, 
but through the grace of God. And this is the highest 


principle (propositio) of the devil and the world from the 
beginning: We do not want to be regarded as doing evil, 
but everything we do must please God, and all his 
prophets must agree with this. If they do not, they must 
die. Away with Abel, Cain shall live! That is our law. And 
so it is done. 

(8) But in the church of the Gentiles this matter has 


reached the highest level (res acta est) and is pursued 
with all seriousness, so that one is justified in thinking 
that the raging of the synagogue was only a game. For 
they did not recognize their Messiah (as Paul says [1 
Cor. 2:8]), "otherwise they would not have crucified the 
Lord of glory. 


Interpretations-On the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1526-1530. 





11 


But the church of the Gentiles has accepted him and 
confesses that Christ is the Son of God, who was made 
for us to be righteous [1 Cor. 1:30], and this they sing 
and read and teach publicly. And while this confession 
stands, those who want to be the church still persecute 
and rage against those who believe, teach and do 
nothing else than that Christ is exactly what they 
themselves are forced to confess with false mouths and 
fabricated works. For nowadays they rule under Christ's 
name; if they could maintain this rule without Christ's 
name, they would also show him (Christ) outwardly as 
such, as they have him in their hearts. But they think far 
less of him than the Jews, who at least hold that he is a 
thola, that is, an avenger, who was justly put to death on 
the cross; but our [papists] hold him to be a fable, as it 
were a kind of fictitious deity among the heathen, as may 
be seen at Rome in the court of the pope and almost in 
all Italy. 

(9) Therefore, since Christ is a mockery to his 
Christians (for that is the name they want), and Cain kills 
Abel without ceasing, and the abomination of Satan 
reigns supreme, it is necessary that we practice this 
article most diligently and resist Satan, whether we 
speak as children or are eloquent, whether we are 
learned or unlearned. For even if all men were to be 
silent, even rocks and stones would have to cry out to 
this rock [Luc. 19:40]. 

10. Therefore, | too will gladly do my duty and admit 
that this extremely eloquent interpretation is published in 
order to encourage the brothers in Christ against the 
plots and wickedness of Satan, who in these last and 


most dangerous (extremis) times has gone into such 
great frenzy against this salvific knowledge of Christ, 
that, just as men have hitherto been seen to be 
possessed by devils and to become insane, now the 
devils themselves seem to be possessed by worse 
devils and to be raging with more than diabolical fury. 
For this

Luther's Foreword. 


W. vm, isso-1584. 13 








This enemy of truth and life feels that the terrible day of 
his condemnation is very near, but the longed-for, joyful 
day of our redemption, which will put an end to his 
tyranny, is near to us. For it is not without cause that he 
will be in such great consternation that all his limbs and 
strength will tremble, like a thief or an adulterer who is 
caught when the sun rises and betrays him. 

(11) For who has ever heard (to say nothing of the 
abominations of the pope) that such great monstrosities 
have suddenly broken out, as we see in recent times as 
an example in the Anabaptists alone? In them the devil, 
as if he wanted to exhale the last breath of his dominion, 
is everywhere driving his own with frightening 
movements, and as if he suddenly wanted not only to 
turn the whole world with riots, but also to devour the 
whole Christ with the church through innumerable sects. 

(12) So he does not rage and rage against other lives 
or opinions of men, namely, adulterers, thieves, 
murderers, perjurers, wicked men, robbers of God, 
unbelievers. Yes, he leaves them in peace, flatters them 
sweetly in his palace and lets them have it all. Just as in 
the beginning of the church he not only tolerated all the 
idolatries and religions of the whole world untouched 
and quietly, but also cultivated them most splendidly, but 
only plagued Christ's church and worship on all sides, 
then left all heretics in peace, but only troubled the right 


Christian (catholicam) doctrine: so also today he has 
nothing to do with but this one thing, which is always his 
real business, that he should persecute our Lord Christ 
(who is our righteousness without our works), as it is 
written of him (Gen. 3:15), "Thou shalt bruise his heel." 

(13) But it is not both against these [devil's caves] 
and for the sake of our [Christians] that our thoughts 
about this letter of Saint Paul go out. These will either 
give me thanks in the Lord for my diligence, ‘or give me 
credit for my incapacity and boldness. 





hold good. | should be very sorry, however, if this had 
the applause of the ungodly, but | only wanted them to 
be provoked [to anger] with their God [the devil] by it, 
since this (with my hard work) has been presented only 
to those to whom Paul himself addressed this epistle, 
namely to the troubled, the afflicted, the afflicted and the 
challenged in faith (for only these understand it), 
unhappy Galatians. But those who are not such people 
may listen to the papists, monks, Anabaptists, and many 
other teachers of infinite wisdom and their own worship, 
and confidently despise ours, not even bothering to 
understand it. 

(14) For papists and Anabaptists today agree with 
one another against the Church of God on this one 
opinion (although they deny it with words), that God's 
work depends on the worthiness of the person. For this 
is what the Anabaptists teach: Baptism is nothing if the 
person should not be a believer. From this basis 


(principio == supersentence) (as it is called) it follows 
with necessity that all the works of God are nothing if the 
person is not good. Baptism, however, is the work of 
God, but the evil man makes it not to be the work of God. 
From this it follows further: Marriage, authority, the 
status of a servant are works of God, but because men 
are evil, therefore they are not works of God; the 
ungodly have the sun, the moon, the earth, the waters, 
the air, and everything that has been subjected to man, 
but because they are ungodly, not pious, therefore the 
sun is not the sun; the moon, the earth, the waters, the 
air are not what they are. They themselves, the 
rebaptizers, had bodies and souls before their 
rebaptism, but because they were not pious, they did not 
have right bodies and souls. Likewise, their parents 
have not been true spouses (as they confess) because 
they have not been rebaptized, so they, the Anabaptists, 
are all bastards, and all their parents were adulterers 
and fornicators. Nevertheless, they inherit the goods of 
their parents, even though they confess that they are 
bastards and heirless. Now who does not see here in 
the Anabaptists that they are not possessed men? 


14 Lri.i, 8-ia. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1534-1537. 


15 





They are right devils who are possessed by worse devils. 

(15) In the same way, the papists to this day do not 
cease to insist on works and the worthiness of the person 
against grace and to strongly support (at least with 
words) their brothers, the Anabaptists. For these foxes 
are joined together by their tails [Judges 15:4], but their 
heads go apart. For they [the papists] present 
themselves outwardly as if they were great enemies of 
those [Anabaptists], although inwardly they hold, teach 
and defend exactly the same against the one Savior 
Christ, who alone is our righteousness [Jer. 23:6, 33:16]. 

16 Therefore, whoever can, hold fast to this one 
article. Let the others who are shipwrecked drift wherever 
the sea and the winds will, until they return to the ship or 
swim to shore. 

The sum and end of the trouble is: that one hopes for 
no rest or end of the trouble, as long as Christ and Belial 
are not one. One generation passes away, another 
arises. When one heresy falls, another soon rises, 
because the devil neither sleeps nor slumbers. | [though 
| am nothing], who have now been twenty years in the 
service of Christ, can testify with truth that | have been 
attacked by more than twenty sects, some of which have 
perished altogether, but others still twitch somewhat like 
[torn off] limbs of insects. 

(18) But Satan, this god of the spirits of the wicked, 
sets up new sects daily, and most recently this one, of 
which | would have been least concerned or anxious, 
namely, the people who teach that the Ten 
Commandments must be removed from the church, 1) 
that people should not be frightened by the law, but that 
they should be kindly admonished by the grace of Christ, 
so that the word of the prophet Micah may be fulfilled 
[Hof. 4, 4]: "But no one is to be punished"; "We are not to 
be punished" [Mich. 2, 6]: as if we do not 


1) This refers to the Antinomians. This passage proves that this 
preface is to be placed in the year 1538. See also "Luthers Schriften 
wider die Antinomer", Walch, St. Louiser Ausgabe, Vol. XX, 1610 ff. 
and the introduction to it. 





They know or have never taught that the anguished and 
broken hearts should be raised by Christ, but the hard 
Pharaohs, to whom the grace of God is preached in vain, 
are frightened by the law, since they themselves are 
forced to invent "revelations of wrath" 2) against the 
wicked and unbelievers, as if the law were or could be 
something other than a revelation of wrath. So great is 
the blindness and hopefulness of these people who have 
condemned themselves [Titus 3:11]. 

(19) Therefore the ministers of the word must be 
sure, if they would be found faithful and wise in the day 
of Christ, that St. Paul's word was not spoken in vain, nor 
prophesied in vain [1 Cor. 11:19]: "There must be 
breeds, that they which are righteous may be made 
manifest." A servant of Christ, | say, must know that as 
long as he teaches Christ pure and true, there will be no 
lack of perverse men, even among our own, who take 
pains to confuse the church. 

20. but let him strengthen himself with this comfort, 
that there can be no peace between Christ and Belial [2 
Cor. 6:15], or between the seed of the serpent and the

testimony of our conscience" [2 Cor. 1:12], "that we are 
found standing and fighting on the side of the seed of the 
woman against the seed of the serpent. This one may 
bite us in the heel and not cease to bite, but let us not 
cease to bruise his head through Christ, the first and 
chief of the serpent's treaders, blessed for ever and ever,

[Detailed explanation of the epistle to the Galatians.] 


[Address of D. Martin Luther to his listeners] *) 


We have undertaken to interpret anew in the name of 
the Lord the epistle of Paul to the Galatians, not because 
we want to present something new or unknown, since by 
the grace of God the whole of Paul is now well known to 


you and has become common knowledge (vulgatus), but 
because, as | often remind you, this is a very great and 
obvious danger, that the devil may take away the pure 
doctrine of faith and again introduce doctrines of works 
and the statutes of men. 

2 Therefore, it is of great benefit that this doctrine of 
faith be constantly read and heard in public. And 
however well one may know it and learn it thoroughly, 
the devil, our adversary, the 


The evil spirit that always goes about and seeks to 
devour us is not dead, just as our flesh is still alive, and 
finally all temptations come at us from all sides and 
oppress us. Therefore, this doctrine can never be 
sufficiently acted upon and imprinted. When it lies and 
perishes, the whole knowledge of truth lies and perishes 
at the same time. But when it blossoms, all good things 
blossom, religion, right worship, the glory of God, the 
certain knowledge of all states and things. So that we 
are not completely inactive, let us begin again where we 
left off, according to the words [Sir. 18, 6. according to 
the Vulg.]: "When a man has left off, let him begin again." 


What the epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians is about. 


First of all, it must be said what it is about, that is, 
what Paul is dealing with in this epistle. Paul wants to 
strengthen the doctrine of faith, grace, forgiveness of 
sins, or Christian righteousness in such a way that we 
have complete knowledge and a certain distinction 
between Christian righteousness and all other 
righteousnesses. For there are many kinds of 
righteousness: one is the temporal, with which the 
emperor, the princes of the world, philosophers and 
jurists have to do. Another is ceremonial, which is taught 
by human statutes, as are the statutes of the pope and 
the like. Household fathers and schoolmasters teach the 
same without danger, because they do not 


They do not give the ceremonies the power to be 
sufficient for sin, to atone for God, and to merit grace, 
but they teach the ceremonies only as necessary for 
outward discipline and for a certain order. In addition, 
there is another, namely the righteousness of the Law or 
the Ten Commandments, which Moses teaches. This 
we also teach, after we have taken the doctrine of faith 
as a basis. 

(2) Further and above all these is the righteousness 
of faith or Christian righteousness, which must be most 
carefully distinguished from the foregoing. For the 
foregoing are wholly opposed to it, partly because they 
are derived from the laws of the emperors, from the 
statutes of the Pab-

epistle anew.

The reason for this is that they are not only the result of 
God's commandments and flow from them, but also 
because they have to do with our works and can be done 
by us, be it from purely natural forces (as the school 


theologians [sophistae] speak of it), 

or whether it is also from God's gift (for these 
righteousnesses of works are also God's gifts, like other 
goods we have). 

But this righteousness, that is, the righteousness of 
faith, is the most precious, which God imputes to us for 
Christ's sake without our works; it is also not a worldly 
righteousness, nor a ceremonial righteousness, nor a 
righteousness from the divine law; it also has nothing to 
do with our works, but is completely different, that is, it is 
only a_ suffering righteousness (just as _ the 
aforementioned righteousnesses are active 
righteousnesses). For in this we do not work anything, nor 
do we have anything that we give to God, but only 
receive, and suffer that another, namely God, may work 
in us. Therefore, this righteousness of faith or Christian 
righteousness can be called a suffering righteousness. 

4 And this is the righteousness that is hidden in 
mystery [Col. 1:26], which the world does not understand; 
indeed, Christians do not grasp it sufficiently, and it is 
difficult for them to grasp it in temptations. Therefore it 
must always be inculcated and urged without ceasing. 
And whoever does not hold on to it or grasp it in 
tribulations and terrors of conscience cannot stand. For 
there is no other comfort of conscience so firm and certain 
as this suffering righteousness. 

(5) But the inability and misery of man is such that in 
distress of conscience and in danger of death we look to 
nothing but our works, our worthiness and the law. When 
this shows us our sin, it immediately comes to our mind 
how badly we have lived our lives. Then the sinner sighs 
in great sorrow of heart and thinks to himself: Oh, how 
ungodly | have lived! If God wanted me to live longer, then 
| would improve my life 2c. And human reason (so much 
is this evil ingrained in us, and so much have we acquired 
this unfortunate condition) can extricate itself from this 
delusion of active or own righteousness. 





The human being does not wriggle out of the situation 
and does not rise to look at the suffering or Christian 
righteousness, but simply remains attached to the active 
one. 

By abusing the weakness of nature, Satan increases 
and sharpens these thoughts. Therefore, it cannot be 
otherwise than that the conscience will tremble, be 
dismayed and frightened all the more. For it is impossible 
for the human heart to draw comfort from itself and have 
grace alone in view when it feels sin and is frightened by 
it, or that it steadfastly throws away the disputation about 
works 2c. For this is beyond the powers, thoughts and 
comprehension of men, and even beyond the law of 
God. The law of God is indeed the highest of all that is in 
the world, but so much is lacking in it that it could make 
a frightened conscience confident, that it sinks it even 
more into sorrow and brings it to despair. For "through 
the law sin becomes exceedingly sinful." Rom. 7, 13. 

(7) Therefore, a sorrowful conscience has no help 
against despair and eternal death unless it grasps the 
promise of the grace offered in Christ, that is, this 
suffering or Christian righteousness of faith; when it has 
grasped this, it can be satisfied and confidently say: | do 
not seek the active righteousness which | ought to have 
and do; but if | had it and did it, | could not put my trust 
in it, nor oppose it to the judgment of God. Therefore | 
renounce all active righteousness and the righteousness 
of the divine law, and take hold only of the suffering 
righteousness, which is the righteousness of grace, 
mercy, forgiveness of sins, in short, of Christ and the 
Holy Spirit, which we do not do, but suffer, not have, but 
receive, in that God the Father gives it to us through 
Jesus Christ. 

8. just as the earth itself does not bring forth rain, nor 
can it obtain it by any work, labor, or strength of its own, 
but receives it only by a heavenly gift from above [Heb. 
6:7], so this rain is given to us by God, without our work 
or merit.

earth can do on its own to receive abundant andiold man, but the promise and grace before the new man,

14 | say this so that no one may think that we reject 
or prevent good works, as the papists falsely accuse us, 
not understanding either what they themselves say or 
what we teach. They know nothing but the righteousness 
of the law, and yet they want to be judges of doctrine, 
which is far above the law and transcends it, over which 
a carnal man cannot possibly judge. Therefore, they 
must necessarily be angry, because they cannot look 
higher than the law. Therefore, everything that is higher 
than the law causes them the greatest annoyance. 

(15) We set up, as it were, two worlds, one heavenly 
and one earthly. In these we assign their place to these 
two righteousnesses, which are separate and far apart 
from each other. The righteousness of the law is earthly, 
has to do with earthly things, through which we do good 
works. But just as the earth does not bring forth fruit 
unless it has first been moistened and made fruitful from 
heaven (for the earth cannot master, renew, and govern 
heaven, but vice versa, heaven masters, renews, 
governs, and fertilizes the earth, so that it may do what 
the Lord has commanded): So we also do nothing if we 
do many things by the righteousness of the law, and do 
not fulfill the law if we fulfill the law, unless we are first 
justified without our work and merit by the Christian 
righteousness, which has nothing at all to do with the 
righteousness of the law or the earthly and active 
righteousness. But this is the heavenly and suffering 
righteousness, which we do not have, but receive from 
heaven, not doing, but grasping by faith, by which we rise 
above all laws and works. "As we have borne the image 
of the earthly Adam," says Paul [1 Cor. 15:49], "so shall 
we bear the image of the heavenly," which is a new man 
in a new world, where is no law, no sin, no conscience, 
no death, but joy, righteousness, grace, peace, life, 
blessedness, and glory altogether undisturbed. 

(16) Do we then do nothing, work nothing, to obtain this 
righteousness? | answer: Nothing; for this righteousness 
is that one 





23 


He is not sitting in heaven at the right hand of the Father, 
not as a judge, but "made for us by God for wisdom and 
righteousness and sanctification and redemption" [1 Cor. 
1:30], in short, that he is our high priest, who represents 
us and rules over us and in us through grace. There one 
sees no sin, feels no horror, no biting of the conscience. 
No sin can enter into this heavenly righteousness, for 
there is no law. "But where the law is not, 1) there is no 
transgression" [Rom. 4:15]. Therefore, since sin does not 
take place here, there is certainly no anguish of 
conscience, no terror, no sadness. Therefore John says 
[1 Ep. 3, 9.]: "He who is born of God cannot sin." 

(17) But when there is terror in the conscience, it is a 
sign that this righteousness is gone, that grace is out of 
sight and lost, and Christ, hidden in darkness, is not seen. 
But where Christ is seen in truth, there must necessarily 
be complete and perfect joy in the Lord, and peace of 
conscience, which firmly insists on it: Although | am a 
sinner in the law and lack the righteousness of the law, 
yet | do not despair, therefore | do not have to die, for 
Christ lives, who is my righteousness and my eternal and 
heavenly life. In this righteousness and in this life | have 
no sin, no [evil] conscience, no death. | am indeed a 
sinner as far as the present life and its righteousness are 
concerned, as a child of Adam, where the law accuses 
me, death reigns and will finally devour me; but over this 
life | have another righteousness, another life, which is 
Christ, the Son of God, who knows nothing of sin and 
death, but is righteousness and eternal life, for whose 
sake also this body of mine, after it has died and turned 
to ashes, is raised again and freed from the bondage of 
the law.

25 





and sin, and at the same time be sanctified with the 
Spirit. 

18 Thus both remain as long as we live here. The 
flesh is accused, it is afflicted with temptations, it is 
afflicted and brought to nothing by the active 
righteousness of the law. But the spirit reigns, rejoices 
and is blessed by the suffering righteousness, because 
it Knows that it has a Lord who sits in heaven at the right 
hand of the Father, who has done away with the law, 
trampled sin and death and all evil under his feet, led 
them captive and "made a triumph of them by himself" 
[Col. 2:15]. 

(19) This, then, is Paul's purpose in this epistle, that 
he may diligently instruct, strengthen, and sustain us in 
the perfect knowledge of this most excellent and 
Christian righteousness. For if this article of justification 
is lost, then the whole Christian doctrine is lost at the 
same time. And all people in the world who do not hold 
it [justification] are either Jews, or Turks, or Papists, or 
heretics, because between these two righteousnesses, 
the active one of the law and the suffering one of Christ, 
there is no middle ground. Therefore, whoever strays 
from Christian righteousness must fall back into active 
righteousness, that is, because he has lost Christ, he 
must fall into placing his trust in his own works. 

20 We see this today in the swarm spirits, who cause 
sects, teach nothing, nor can they teach rightly about this 
righteousness of grace (the words, of course, they have 
taken from our mouths and our writings), 1) therefore 
they speak and write only words. But they cannot 
present the matter itself, neither can they urge it nor 
inculcate it, because they do not understand it, nor can 
they understand it, since they cling only to the 
righteousness of the law. That is why they are and will 
remain workmen who cannot rise above the active 
justice. 

21 Therefore they remain the same people they were 
under the pope, only they bring up new names and new 
works, but the thing remains the same; as the Turks do 
different works than the papists, the papists 


1) These brackets are set by us. 





do other works than the Jews 2c. But no matter how 
much more apparent, greater, and more difficult the 
works may be than the others, the essence remains the 
same; only the nature is different, that is, the works differ 
only in outward appearance, but in fact and truth they are 
works, and those who do them are not Christians, but are 
and remain works saints, whether they are called Jews, 
Mahometists, Papists, or Anabaptists 2c. 

(22) Therefore, we constantly repeat this doctrine of 
faith or Christian righteousness, insisting on it so much 
and pursuing it so earnestly that it may remain in 
constant use and be clearly distinguished from the active 
righteousness of the law. In no other way will we be able 
to preserve true theology (for it is from this and in this 
teaching alone that the church arises and exists), but we 
will immediately become lawyers, ceremonialists, 
teachers of the law, papists: Christ will be obscured, and 
no one can be properly taught and raised up in the 
church. Therefore, if we want to be preachers and 
teachers of others, we must pay attention to these things 
with the utmost care and keep this difference of the 
righteousness of the law and the righteousness of Christ 
well. This is easy to say, but in experience and in 
application it is the most difficult thing to do, even if it is 
most carefully sharpened and practiced, because at the 
hour of death or in other struggles of the conscience 
these two righteousnesses come closer together than 
one might wish or want. 

(23) Therefore | exhort you, especially you who will be 
teachers of consciences, and each one in particular, to 


practice study, reading, meditation and prayer, so that 
you may be able to instruct and comfort both your own 
consciences and the consciences of others in tribulation, 
and lead them from law to grace, from active 
righteousness to suffering righteousness, in short, from 
Moses to Christ. For the devil uses the law to frighten us 
in tribulation and in the battle of conscience, and to 
reproach us with our evil conscience about sin, our 
extremely shameful way of life, the wrath and judgment 
of God, hell, and 


26 Lri. 1, 22-24. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1S54-15S7. 


eternal death, so that he may plunge us into despair, 
make us subservient to himself and withdraw us from 
Christ. He even holds up to us passages from the Gospel 
in which Christ himself demands works from us and 
threatens those who have not done them with 
condemnation in clear words. If we do not know how to 
distinguish between these two righteousnesses, if we do 
not take hold of Christ in faith, who sits at the right hand 
of God, who is our life and our righteousness, who also 
represents us poor sinners to the Father, then we are 
under the law, not under grace, and Christ is no longer a 
savior, but a lawgiver. There can be no blessedness left, 
but certain despair and eternal death will follow. 
Therefore, we must most diligently learn this art of 
distinguishing between these two righteousnesses, so 
that we may know how far we must obey the law. 

(24) We have said above [§§ 11, 12] that the law 
must not exceed its limits in a Christian, but must have 
its dominion only over the flesh, which is to be subject to 
it and remain under it. Where this happens, the law 
remains within its bounds. But if it wants to take over the 
conscience and rule here, see to it that you then are a 
good dialecticus, divide rightly, and do not grant the law 
more than must be granted to it, but say: "Law, you want 
to climb up into the realm of the conscience and rule 
there, and accuse it of sin, and cancel the joy of the 
heart, which | have from faith in Christ, and bring me to 
despair, that | should despair and perish. This you do, 
and yet it is not your office. Stay in your place and 
exercise dominion over the flesh, but do not touch my 
conscience. For | am baptized and called through the 
gospel to the fellowship of righteousness and eternal life. 


27 


| want to go to the kingdom of Christ, where my 
conscience has found rest, where there is no law, but 
only forgiveness of sins, peace, rest, joy, bliss and 
eternal life. These things thou dost not deceive me, for | 
will not suffer thee to reign as a harsh tyrant and as a 
cruel driver in my conscience. For it is the seat and 
temple of Christ, the Son of God, who is the King of 
righteousness and peace and an exceedingly loving 
Savior and my mediator. He will keep my conscience 
happy and satisfied in the sound and pure doctrine of the 
gospel and in the knowledge of this suffering 
righteousness. 

(25) When | have this righteousness in my heart, | 
descend from heaven as rain that fertilizes the earth, that 
is, | go out into another realm and do good works as 
much as | can. If | am a minister of the word, | preach, 
comfort the fainthearted, administer the sacraments; if | 
am a householder, | govern my house, my servants, 
educate my children to godliness and respectability; if | 
am a person in authority, | carry out my office, which God 
has commanded me to do; if | am a servant, | faithfully 
let myself be commanded in the affairs of my master. In 
short, anyone who knows for certain that Christ is his 
righteousness not only does everything well in his 
profession from his heart and with joy, but also submits 
out of love to the authorities, even to their ungodly laws, 
even to all the burdens and dangers of this life, if 
circumstances require it, because he knows that this is 
God's will and that such obedience pleases him. 

That is enough about what this epistle is about. Paul 
takes this before him and sets it forth, prompted by false 
teachers who had obscured this righteousness of faith 
from the Galatians. Against these he boasts of his 
[apostolic] reputation and office. 


28 Lri. 1, 24-W. Exec. Explanation d. Epistle to the GalatiansW 


. VIII, 1558-1S68. 29 


The first chapter. 


V. 1.2. Paul, an apostle (not of men, nor by men, but 
by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him 
from the dead), and all the brethren that are with me: the 
commoners of Galatia. 


Now that we have stated what the epistle to the 
Galatians is about, and the brief epitome of it, let us now, 
before we come to the matter itself, say what prompted 
Paul to write this epistle. He had planted the pure 
doctrine of the gospel and the righteousness of faith 
among the Galatians, but immediately after his 
departure false teachers crept in who overturned 
everything he had planted and taught well. 

(2) For the devil cannot do otherwise, he must fiercely 
contest this doctrine with violence and cunning, and he 
will not rest until he suppresses it, or corrupts it by 
tyrants, or at least by swarming spirits, and at last, for 
the sake of the same, but under the appearance of 
godliness, imposes an ungodly doctrine on the safe and 
snoring people. And for the sake of this one cause, that 
we present the teaching of the gospel purely, we have 
the devil for an enemy today, who arouses against us 
the raving of the world and the bitterest hatred of the 
heretics. 

But the gospel is such a doctrine, which teaches 
something far more sublime than the world's wisdom, 
righteousness, and worship, namely, the forgiveness of 
sins, free of charge, through Christ. The gospel lets 
those things in their position be what they are, and 
praises them as good creatures of God, but the world 
prefers these creatures to the Creator and even wants 
to redeem sins through them, to be freed from death and 
to earn eternal life. This is condemned by the gospel. 

4 On the other hand, the world cannot stand that the 
best it has should be condemned. Therefore, it attaches 
this stain to the gospel as if it were a rebellious and 
erroneous doctrine, 





which overthrows states, countries, principalities, 
kingdoms and empire and therefore sins against God 
and against the emperor, deviates from the laws, 
corrupts good morals, and allows anyone the freedom to 
do whatever he wants with impunity. Therefore, the 
world pursues this doctrine with quite just zeal and, as it 
can be seen, with the highest desire to render service to 
God, and detests the teachers and followers of it as the 
most pernicious plague that could exist on earth. 

Then, through the teaching of the gospel, the devil 
will be trampled underfoot, his kingdom will be 
destroyed, and the law, sin, and death (through which 
he, as the most powerful and insurmountable tyrant, has 
subjugated the entire human race to his rule) will be 
snatched away from him. At last his prisoners are 
transferred from the kingdom of darkness and bondage 
to the kingdom of light and freedom. Should the devil 
suffer this? Shouldn't the father of lies use all his powers 
and artifices to darken, corrupt and completely eradicate 
this doctrine of blessedness and eternal life? At least 
Paul complains in this letter and in all his other epistles 
that Satan had done this in a very special way through 
his apostles while Paul was still alive. 

6 We lament and weep for the same thing today, that 
Satan has done more harm to our gospel through his 
servants, the spirits of the swarms, than through all the 
kings, princes and bishops who have _ violently 
persecuted it and are still persecuting it. And if we here 
in Wittenberg had not watched and worked so diligently 
and carefully in planting and teaching this doctrine of the 
faith, we would not have remained in harmony so long, 
but sects would already have arisen even among 
ourselves. But because we remain steadfast in this 
doctrine and diligently practice it, it keeps us in the 
greatest unity and peace. Others, who either

neglect, or, as they make themselves believe, want to 
teach something higher, fall into various and pernicious 
errors and sects, of which there is no end, and are lost. 
Here we have only wanted to indicate in passing that the 
gospel is such a doctrine, which condemns. all 
righteousness and preaches only the righteousness of 
Christ, and brings peace of conscience and all goods to 
those who embrace it, and that nevertheless the world 
hates and persecutes it most bitterly 2c. 

7 | have said that Paul had this reason to write this 
epistle, that soon after his departure false teachers tore 
down among the Galatians what he had built up with great 
labor and in a long time. But the false teachers or false 
apostles were people who were held in great esteem, who 
came from the circumcision and the Pharisees and 
boasted to the people that they were from the holy and 
chosen people of the Jews: they were Israelites from the 
seed of Abraham, they had the promises, the fathers 2c.; 
finally, they were servants of Christ and disciples of the 
apostles, with whom they had had contact, and had seen 
their miracles. Perhaps they themselves also performed 
signs, for Christ testifies Matth. 7, 22 that even the wicked 
perform signs. 

8 Then they also diminished Paul's reputation with all 
the artifices at their command, saying, "Why do you exalt 
Paul so high and honor him so much? Surely he was the 
last of all to be converted to Christ. We are disciples and 
intimate friends of the apostles; we have seen Christ 
perform miracles and have heard him preach. Paul is later 
and lesser than us, and it is also not possible that God 
would let us err, who are of the holy people, and servants 
of Christ, and have received the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, 
we are a whole number, but Paul is alone, who did not 
associate with the apostles, nor did he see Christ; indeed, 
he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time. Should 
God have let so many churches err for the sake of one 
Paul? 

(9) Where people of such great renown come to a city or 
country. 





one immediately looks up to them with admiration, and 
with this appearance of godliness they deceive not only 
the simple-minded, but also scholars and people who 
are well established in the faith, especially if they, as 
those did, boast of their descent from the patriarchs, 
likewise that they are servants of Christ and disciples of 
the apostles 2c. In this way, the pope today, because he 
has no Scripture with which to defend himself, uses for 
and against us this one reason: Church, Church! Do you 
think that God is so angry that He should reject His 
whole Church for the sake of a few heretical Lutherans? 
Do you think that He has let His Church err for so many 
centuries? This is what he insists on most, that the 
church cannot be overthrown. Just as many people are 
moved by this reason today, so the false apostles in 
Paul's time captured the minds of the Galatians by the 
astonishing preaching of their own praise, so that Paul 
lost his reputation among them and his teaching was 
made suspect. 

(10) Against this empty boasting of the false apostles, 
Paul raises his apostolic reputation with great firmness 
and unshakable confidence and gloriously praises his 


profession and defends his apostleship (ministerium), 
and, which he does nowhere else, does not want to yield 
to anyone, not even the apostles, much less their 
disciples. And in order to break their Pharisaic arrogance 
and hard forehead, he tells the incident that happened 
in Antioch, where he had resisted Peter himself. 
Moreover, he does not shy away from the great 
astonishment, and clearly states in the text that he had 
taken upon himself to accuse and punish even Peter, 
the chief of the apostles, who had seen Christ and had 
had the most intimate intercourse with him. | am an 
apostle, he says, and one who cares nothing about what 
others are, and in such a way that | have not been afraid 
to punish even the pillar of the other apostles. 

In short, in the first two chapters he does almost 
nothing else than praising his profession, his apostleship 
and his gospel, which is not human and which he did not 
receive from any man, 


32 Lri. 1, 28-30. Explanation of Galatians 1, 1. W. VIII, 1571-1575. 


33 





but by the revelation of Jesus Christ; likewise, if he 
himself, or even an angel from heaven, should preach 
any other gospel than the one he preached, let him be 
accursed. 


The certainty of Deruss. 


(12) But what is the purpose of Paul's boasting? | 
answer: This main part of Christian doctrine (locus 


communis) serves that every minister of the divine word 
may be sure of his calling, so that he may confidently 
boast before God and men that he preaches the gospel 
as one who is called and sent, just as the messenger of 
a king boasts and flaunts that he does not come as a 
private person, but as the king's messenger. And 
because of this dignity, that he is the messenger of the 
king, honor is given to him, that he has the precedence 
and sits on top, which would not happen to him if he were 
there as a private person. 

(13) Therefore a preacher of the gospel should be 
certain that he has a divine calling, and it is of great 
benefit that, following the example of Paul, he magnifies 
and boasts of his calling before the people, so that he 
may gain prestige among his hearers, just as a royal 
envoy boasts of his legation. This is not a vain boast, but 
a necessary boast, because he does not boast because 
of his own person, but for the sake of the king who sent 
him. He desires that the king's reputation be held in 
honor and inviolable. And when he expresses the will in 
the name of the king that something should be carried 
out by the subjects, he does not say: We ask, but: We 
command, we will that this be done 2c. But as a private 
person he says: We ask 2c. 

14 Thus also, when Paul gloriously exalts his 
profession, he does not exalt himself in a presumptuous 
manner, as many think, but he praises his apostleship 
with a necessary and holy pride, as he says in the Epistle 
to the Romans Cap. 11, v. 13: "As long as | am an 
apostle to the Gentiles, | will praise my ministry," that is, 
| want people to receive me, not as Paul of Tarsus, but 
as Paul of Tarsus. 





as Paul, the messenger or apostle of Jesus Christ. And 
this he does, of necessity, in order to gain prestige, so 
that the listeners, who hear this, become attentive, 
inclined and willing to be taught. For they do not hear the 
man who is only Paul, but in the person of Paul Christ 
Himself, and God the Father who deputizes him. Just as 
people owe a sacred reverence to God's prestige and 
majesty, they must also receive and listen to His 
messengers, who bring His word, with the highest 
reverence. 

15 Now this is a strange passage, since Paul is so 
proud of his profession and boasts of it that he despises 
all others. If someone would humanly despise all others 
against himself and arrogate everything to himself, he 
would commit an extraordinary folly and would thereby 
also sin gravely. But here this boasting is necessary and 
it is not intended for the honor of Paul or our honor, but 
for the honor of God, to whom a sacrifice of praise and 
thanksgiving is offered. For through this praise the 
name, or the grace and mercy of God is made known to 
the world. The epistle to the Galatians now begins with 
these words: 


V. 1. Paul, an apostle, not of men 2c. 

16 Right at the beginning he attacks the false 
teachers, who boasted that they were disciples of the 
apostles and sent by them. But they despised Paul 
because he was neither a disciple of the apostles nor 
sent by anyone to preach the gospel, but had come from 
somewhere else and had entered this ministry on his 
own authority. Against these Paul defends his calling by 
saying: "My calling seems to be contemptible to your 
preachers, but whoever they may be that have come to 
you, they have been sent either by men or through a 
man, that is, either they have come of themselves 
without a calling, or called by others. My profession, 
however, is neither from men nor through a man, but it 
is above all profession, which is according to 


34 Lri.O "I. 1, 30-32. -‘Alusations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 157S-1578. 35 


could happen to the apostles. For he is "through Jesus 
Christ and God the Father" 2c. 

| understand the word "of men" as follows: those who 
call and invade themselves, while neither God nor men 
call or send them, but walk and talk of themselves, like 
the swarming spirits nowadays, who either creep through 
the corners and look for space where they want to pour 
out their poison (they do not come to the public 
churches), or come where the gospel is planted before. 
This is what | call: "by men." But: "by a man" who have a 
divine calling, but by a man. 

18 It is therefore a twofold divine calling, one indirect, 
the other direct. God calls us all today to the ministry of 
preaching through the indirect calling, that is, through a 
calling that happens through a means, that is, through a 
man. The apostles, however, were called without means 
by Christ Himself, just as the prophets in the Old 
Testament were called by God Himself. Afterwards the 
apostles called their disciples, like Paul called Timothy, 
Titus 2c., who then called bishops, as Titus 1, 5. is 
written; the bishops called their successors. This 
profession has remained until our times and will remain 
until the end of the world. It is an indirect profession, 
because it happens through a human being, and yet a 
divine profession. 

(19) If in this way the prince or the authorities, or |, 
call someone, he has a calling through a man; and this, 
according to the apostles, is the general way of calling in 
the whole world. And this is not to be changed, but held 
in high esteem for the sake of the deceivers, who despise 
it and boast of another better calling, since, as they say, 
the Spirit impels them to teach. But the deceivers lie. 
They are indeed driven by a spirit, but not by a good spirit, 
but by the evil spirit. It is not for me to go from my 
appointed place (sortem) to another city, where | am not 
called as a minister of the Word, and to preach there (that 
is, if 1am a preacher; but if | am a doctor, | could preach 
throughout the whole papacy, if only they would let me), 
even if | heard that they were teaching falsely there, that 
the souls of the people of the world were not being taught. 


| am to command the matter to God, who in his time will 
find opportunity to call preachers in a proper way and to 
give his word. For he is the Lord of the harvest, who will 
also send laborers into his harvest; it is ours to ask, 
Matth. 9, 38. 

20 Therefore, it is not necessary to take hold of 
someone else's harvest, as the devil tends to incite his 
servants to run without a profession, and to use this 
fervent zeal as a pretext: they are sorry that people are 
so miserably deceived; they want to teach the truth and 
snatch the deceived out of the devil's snares. Yes, even 
if someone, out of godly zeal and in good opinion, 
wanted to help the deceived out of error through right 
teaching, this would still set an evil example, creating an 
opportunity for godless teachers to intrude, through 
which Satan would then take the preaching chair and do 
great harm. 

(21) But if the prince or another person in authority 
calls me, then | can certainly and confidently boast 
against the devil and the enemies of the gospel that | am 
called by God's command through the voice of a man. 
For there is God's command through the mouth of the 
prince, which makes me certain that my calling is a right 
and divine calling. Therefore, we too are called by divine 
authority, not directly by Christ, as the apostles were, but 
through a man. 

(22) This teaching of the certainty of the calling is very 
necessary against the corrupt and devilish spirits, who 
boast of the Spirit and the heavenly calling beyond 
measure and deceive many by this pretense; and yet 
they lie quite brazenly. Therefore, the certainty that we 
are called serves that each one may boast with John the 
Baptist [Luc. 3:2]: "The command of God has gone out 
to me." That | now teach the word, baptize and 
administer the sacraments, | do so because | have the 
command and am called to do so, for God's voice has 
spoken to me, not in the corner, 


36 Lri. ttai. 1, 32-35. Explanation of Galatians 1, 1. W. VIII, 1578-1582. 


37 





as the enthusiasts boast, but by the mouth of aman who 
is in a rightful office. 

But if one or two citizens ask me to preach, | should 
not obey such a private call, because it would open the 
door to the servants of the devil, who would then invoke 
this example and do harm, as we said above. But if | am 
required by those who hold a public office, then | shall 
obey. 

(24) Saying then, "Paul, an apostle not of men, nor 
by men," he meets and overcomes (reprimands) the 
false apostles with these words, as if to say, "However 
highly they may boast, what more can these vipers boast 
than that they have come, either from men, that is, of 
themselves, no one having called them, or by men, that 
is, sent by others? | have no interest in all this, nor do 
you need to ask anything about it. But | am neither called 
nor sent by men, but directly, that is, by Jesus Christ, 
and my calling is in all respects like the calling of the 
[other] apostles, and | am certainly an apostle. 

Therefore Paul treats the doctrine of the calling of the 
apostles very diligently, and elsewhere separates the 
apostleship from the other [spiritual offices), as 1 Cor. 
12, 28. and Eph. 4, 11.: "He has appointed some to be 
apostles, but some to be prophets" 2c., by putting the 
apostles first [to indicate] that actually only those are 
apostles who are sent directly by God Himself, without 
an intermediary. Thus also Matthias was called straight 
from GOD. For since the other apostles raised two, they 
did not dare to choose one or the other, but cast lots and 
prayed that God would indicate which of these two He 
Himself had chosen [Apost. 1, 23. f.]. For he had to be 
called by God, since he was to be an apostle. In the 
same way Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, was called 
[Apost. 9, 15]. Therefore, the apostles are also called 
holy, because they are certain of their calling and their 
teaching, and have remained faithful in their office, 


and none of them has fallen away except Judas, for their 
profession is holy. 

This is the first strike that Paul makes against the 
false apostles who were running when no one had sent 
them. Therefore one must not despise the profession. 
For it is not enough that one has the word and pure 
doctrine, but there must also be a certain profession; if 
someone intrudes without such a profession, he only 
comes "to choke and kill" [John 10:10]. For God never 
gives proper prosperity to the work of those who are not 
called. And even though they sometimes bring forward 
some wholesome things, they build nothing. Thus, 
nowadays our enthusiasts have the words of faith in their 
mouths, but they do not produce any fruit, but mainly go 
about persuading people with their erroneous opinions 
2c. 

(27) Those who have a certain and holy profession 
must endure many and very difficult struggles; likewise, 
those whose doctrine is pure and wholesome must 
struggle hard to remain in their wholesome ministry 
against the incessant and countless attempts of the devil 
and the ravages of the world. What can such a one do 
whose profession is uncertain and whose teaching is not 
pure? 

28 Our consolation then, who are in the service of the 
word, is this, that we have a holy and heavenly office, to 
which we are ordinarily (rite) called, as we boast against 
all the gates of hell. On the other hand, it is something 
frightening when the conscience says: You have done 
this without a calling. In such a case, such a great terror 
tends to crush the heart that the uncalled preacher 
wishes he had never heard the word he teaches, 
because disobedience makes all works evil, however 
good they may be, so that even the greatest works and 
labors become the greatest sins. 

29 Therefore you see how good and how necessary 
this boasting and praising of our ministry is. In former 
times, when | was still a novice in theology and a young 
doctor, it seemed to me that Paul was acting foolishly, 
that he boasted so often about his profession in all his 
letters. | did not understand what he had in mind, for | 
was 


38 Lri. "Ai. 1, 35-37. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1582-1585. 


39 





| did not know that the service of the word was something 
so great. | knew nothing of the doctrine of faith, nor what 
a right conscience was, because nothing certain was 
taught, neither in the schools nor in the churches, but 
everything was full of sophistical confusion and useless 


chatter of the teachers of papal law (canonistarum) and 


of those who recited the sentences (sententiariorum). 
Therefore, no one could recognize the value and 
meaning of this sacred and spiritual praise of the 
profession. This serves first of all for God's glory, then 
for the praise of our office, finally for our blessedness 
and that of those who are commanded to us (populi). For 
by this boasting we do not seek to be something in the 
world, we do not seek honor among men, not money, not 
prosperity, not the favor of the world 2c. But because we 
are in a divine calling and in the work of God, and 
because the certainty of our calling is most necessary for 
people to know that our word is the word of God, we 
boast of this calling with pride. Therefore, it is not a vain, 
but an exceedingly holy pride against the devil and the 
world, but a right humility before God. 


And by God the Father, who raised him 
from the dead. 


(30) Paul is so fiercely passionate that he cannot wait 
until he gets to the matter at hand, but immediately goes 
into the superscription and says what is in his heart. In 
this letter, he wants to deal with the righteousness of 
faith and defend it, and overthrow the law and the 
righteousness of works. These thoughts fill him 
completely, and his mouth speaks out of this wonderful 
and inexhaustible abundance of the most glorious 
wisdom and knowledge of Christ in his heart. This flame, 
this immense conflagration in his heart cannot remain 
hidden, nor does it allow him to remain silent. Therefore 
he does not content himself with saying that he is an 
apostle sent by Jesus Christ, but he also adds: "By God 
the Father, who raised him from the dead. 

31. but it seems as if this addition: "and by God the 
Father" 2c. is not necessary, but, as | have said, knows 





his heart is full, his mouth overflows. His mind burns and 
longs to bring to light immediately, even in the 
superscription, the unfathomable riches of Christ and to 
preach the righteousness of God, which is called the 
resurrection of the dead. The Christ who lives and is 
raised from the dead speaks from him and drives him. 
Therefore he adds, not without reason, that he is also an 
apostle through God the Father, who raised Jesus Christ 
from the dead, as if he wanted to say: | am dealing here 
with Satan and with those vipers, the instruments of 
Satan, who want to overthrow for me the righteousness 
of Christ, whom God the Father raised from the dead, by 
whom alone we are justified, by whom also we shall be 
raised from the dead to eternal life on the last (illo) day. 
But by thus overthrowing the righteousness of Christ, 
they resist the Father and the Son and their works. 

32 Thus, at the very first word, the whole matter of 
which he speaks in this epistle is revealed to him. As | 
said, he is talking about the resurrection of Christ, "who 
was raised for our righteousness", Rom. 4:15, and 
thereby overcame the law, sin, death and all evil. 
Therefore, Christ's victory is the victory over the law, over 
sin, over our flesh, the world, the devil, death, hell and all 
evil, and he has given us this victory. Therefore, although 
these tyrants and our enemies may accuse and terrify 
us, they cannot plunge us into despair and condemn us, 
for Christ, who was raised from the dead by God the 
Father, is our righteousness and our victory. Thanks be 
to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

But consider how clearly Paul speaks. He does not 
say: by God, who created heaven and earth, who is the 
Lord of angels, who commanded Abraham to go out of 
his country, who sent Moses to Pharaoh, who led Israel 
out of Egypt; as the false apostles did, who boasted that 
he was the God of their fathers, who creates, sustains 
and works all things, and performs miracles among their 
people. But Paul had something 


AO Dii. oui. i, 37-0. Explan. Explanation of Galatians 1, 2. w. vm, 1585-1588. 


41 





But he had something else in his heart, namely the 
righteousness of Christ, which he taught and defended 
as an apostle of Christ. Therefore he speaks words that 
serve this cause, saying, "| am an apostle, neither of 
men nor by men, but by JESUS Christ and GOD the 
Father, who raised him from the dead." So you see how 
great fervor and zeal he is inflamed in the spirit in this 
cause, which he wants to plant and protect against the 
whole kingdom of hell, against all the mighty and wise 
men of the whole world, against the devil and his 
apostles. 


v. 2. And all the brothers who are with 
me. 


34 This also serves to repel the false teachers. For 
all his reasons are directed to praise and exalt his 
ministry, and to make that of the false teachers suspect, 
as if he spoke thus: Although it is sufficient that | am sent 
by divine appointment as an apostle through JESUS 
Christ and GOD the Father, 2c., yet, that [you may see 
that] | am not alone, | add to the abundance all the 
brethren who are not apostles, but my fellow-workers 


(commilitones). They write this epistle with me and 
testify that my teaching is right and divine. Therefore we 
are sure that Christ is present with us, teaching and 
speaking in our midst and in our church. If they are 
anything, they are only sent by men or through men. But 
| am sent by God the Father and Christ, who is the life 
and our resurrection. The others, my brothers, are sent 
by God through a man, namely through me. So that they 
may not say that I, as a single man, exalt myself against 
so many, | have my brothers with me, who are of one 
mind with me, as faithful witnesses, who believe 


(sentiunt), write and teach the same things with me. So 
much for the superscription; now follows to whom the 
letter is addressed. 1) 


1) In antiquity, the name of the writer was placed first in a letter, 
then the name of the addressee. Luther called the former sudseriptio, 
the latter supruseriptio. We have rendered the former by 
"Ueberschrift", the latter by the words: "to whom the letter is 
addressed". 





To the commoners in Galatia. 


35 Paul had preached everywhere in Galatia; 
although he had not completely converted it to Christ, he 
had many churches there, into which all the devil's 
servants, the false apostles, had crept. 

(86) Even nowadays, the zealots do not come to the 
places where the opponents of the gospel rule, but where 
there are Christians and good people who love the 
gospel. They also go to such places in the principalities 
of the tyrants who persecute the gospel. There they 
secretly enter the houses, turn them inside out and pour 
out their poison. 

Why do they not rather go to the cities, countries and 
principalities of the papists and confess and defend their 
doctrine there in the face of the godless princes, bishops 
and teachers at the high schools, as we have done by 
God's grace? The tender martyrs do not want to put 
themselves in danger, but go where the place is already 
prepared by the gospel, where they can be active without 
danger in utmost peace and quiet. So the false apostles 
did not come at their own risk to Jerusalem to Caiphas, 
or to Rome to the emperor, or to other places where no 
one had preached before, as Paul and the other apostles 
had done, but to Galatia, which was already won and 
prepared for Christ through Paul's work and with his 
danger; to Asia, Corinth 2c., where there were good 
people and Christians who persecuted no one, but 
suffered everything. There the enemies of the cross of 
Christ could play their game in greatest safety and 
without all persecution. 

Learn here that this is the fate of godly preachers, that 
in addition to suffering persecution from the ungodly and 
ungrateful world, and founding churches with great labor 
and danger, they must also suffer that what they have 
built with right doctrine over a long period of time is soon 
overthrown by the zealots, who still rule afterwards and 
are preferred to them. This plague hurts the godly 
servants of the Word more than any persecution inflicted 
on them by tyrants.

43 





(39) Therefore, whoever does not want to be 
despised and to endure this unseemly treatment, do not 
become a minister of the gospel, or if he is already one, 
let him command his ministry to another. We experience 
the same today: we are utterly despised and tormented 
from without by tyrants, but from within by the very 
people whom we have set free through the gospel; 
likewise by false brethren. But this is our comfort and 
glory, that we, called by God, have the promise of 
eternal life, and await the reward which no eye has seen, 
nor ear heard, nor has it entered into any man's heart [1 
Cor. 2:9]. For when He Himself, the Arch Shepherd 
Jesus Christ, shall appear, we shall receive the unfading 
crown of glory [1 Pet. 5:4], and He will not let us die of 
hunger or thirst here either. 


Of the church. 1) 


40 St. Jerome raises a big question here: why Paul 
calls them churches, since they are not churches? 
because, he says, Paul writes to the apostate Galatians, 
who have turned from Christ and grace back to Moses 
and the law. To this | reply: Paul calls them "churches in 
Galatia" according to the figure of the synecdoche, 2) 
which is used very frequently in Scripture. Thus, when 
he writes to the Corinthians, he wishes them happiness 
[1 Ep. 1, 4. f.] that the grace of God in Christ has been 
given to them, namely, because through Him they were 
made rich in all doctrine and knowledge. And yet many 
of them were deceived by the false apostles, and did not 
believe that the dead rise again 2c. So also today we call 
the Roman church holy and all bishoprics holy, although 
they are apostates and the bishops and their servants 
are godless, because God rules in the midst of his 
enemies [Ps. 110, 2]. Likewise, the Antichrist sits in the 
temple of God [2 Thess. 2, 4], and Satan is in the midst 
of God's children [Job 1, 6]. 


1) This superscription is only in the Latin Wittenberg edition. 
2) Synecdoche: a part for the whole or the whole for a part. 





41 Therefore, even though the church is in the midst 
of the impious and perverse generation, as Paul says in 
his letter to the Philippians [2:15], even though it is in the 
midst of wolves and robbers, that is, spiritual tyrants, it 
is nevertheless the church. In the city of Rome, although 
it is worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, there remains 
baptism, the Lord's Supper, the word and text of the 
Gospel, the Holy Scriptures, the ministry of preaching, 
the name of Christ and the name of God. Whoever has 
it has it, whoever does not have it is not excused, 
because the treasure is there. Therefore the Roman 
church is holy, because it has the holy name of GOD, it 
has the gospel, baptism 2c. When these things are with 
a people, it is called holy. Thus our city of Wittenberg is 
holy, and we are truly holy, for we are baptized, taught 
and called by God, and partakers of the table of the Lord. 
We have with us God's works, namely the Word and the 
Sacraments; through these we are sanctified. 

| say this for the sake of distinguishing Christian 
holiness from any other with all diligence. The monks 
have called their orders holy (but dared not call 
themselves holy), but they are not holy, for, as we have 
said above [§ 12 f.], Christian holiness is not an active 
but a suffering holiness. Therefore, no one may say that 


he is holy for the sake of his state (vitae genus) or his 
works when he fasts, prays, mortifies his body, gives 
alms to the poor 2c. Otherwise the Pharisee in Lucas 
[Cap. 18, 11. f.] would also be a saint. The works that 
God has commanded are indeed good, and God 
requires them of us most strictly, but they do not make 
us holy before God; but | and you, we are holy, the 
congregation, the city, the people are holy, not through 
their own holiness, but through a foreign holiness, 
because they have divine and holy things, namely the 
calling to the preaching ministry, the gospel, baptism 2c., 
by which they are sanctified. 

(43) Therefore, even though the Galatians had fallen 
away, baptism, the word, and the name of Christ 
remained with them. 2c. There were also some good 
people among them who had not fallen away from Paul's 
teaching. These had from the Word and the Sacraments

They had the right divine mind and used it in the right 
way. Furthermore, the Word and Sacraments could not 
be considered unclean for the sake of the deceived. For 
baptism, the gospel 2c. is not unholy because many are 
defiled and unholy, and have ungodly opinions of it, but 
they remain holy and unchangeable (eadem), whether 
they be with the godly or with the ungodly, for these can 
neither desecrate them nor make them holy. They are 
indeed desanctified and _ sanctified before the 


unchristians (gentibus) by our evil or good behavior, by 
our evil or good life, but not before GOD. 

Therefore, the church is holy, even where the spirits 
of the swarm reign, if only they do not deny God's word 
and the sacraments. For if these are denied, there can 
be no church. Therefore, a holy church is everywhere 
where the Word and the Sacraments remain according 


to their essence (substantialiter), despite the fact that the 
Antichrist reigns there, who, as Scripture testifies [2 
Thess. 2, 4.], sits, not in a devil's stable, not in a pigpen, 
or among a bunch of unbelievers, but in the noblest and 
holiest place, namely in the temple of God. Thus, the 
temple of God must also be where the spiritual tyrants 
reign and be preserved among them. Therefore, we 
briefly answer the question that the Church is in the 
whole world. The Church is everywhere in the world 
where the Gospel and the Sacraments are. Jews, Turks, 
and enthusiasts are not the Church, because they attack 
and deny it. Now comes the greeting. 


V. 3. Grace to you and peace from God 
the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. 


| hope that you know well what grace and peace are, 
because these words occur frequently in Paul and are 
not hidden now. But since we are dealing with this 
epistle, not out of necessity or because of its difficulty, 
but to fortify our consciences against future heresies, it 
will not be vexatious for us to repeat here what we also 
teach, preach, paint, sing, and write elsewhere. For if the 
article of justification lies down, so lies everything. 


Therefore it is most necessary that we constantly 
impress and sharpen it, as Moses [Deut. 6:7] says of his 
law. For it cannot be impressed and insisted upon 
enough or too much. Yea, though we learn it righteously, 
and hold it fast, yet there is none who grasps it perfectly, 
or believes it with entire devotion and with all his heart. 
So slippery is our flesh, and contrary to the obedience of 
the spirit. 

But this apostolic greeting, before the preaching of 
the Gospel began, was new to the world and something 
quite unheard of. And these two words "grace" and 
"peace" comprehend the whole of Christianity in 
themselves. Grace forgives sin, peace makes the 
conscience calm. Our two devils that plague us are sin 
and the [evil] conscience. But these two monsters Christ 
has overcome and trodden under his feet, both in this 
world and in the world to come. This the world does not 
know. Therefore, it cannot teach anything certain about 
how to overcome sin, evil conscience, and death. But the 


Christians have the right way of teaching (hoc doctrinae 


genus), are trained and armed by it, so that they can win 
against sin, against despair and against eternal death. 
And this kind of teaching is given by God, not found by 
free will, by human reason or human wisdom. 

(47) As | have said, these two words, grace and 
peace, comprehend the whole of Christianity; grace the 
forgiveness of sins, peace a calm and joyful conscience. 
Furthermore, one can never have peace of conscience 
unless sin is forgiven. However, it is not forgiven for the 
sake of fulfilling the law, because no one satisfies the 
law, but rather the law reveals sin, accuses and frightens 
the conscience, proclaims the wrath of God and drives 
to despair. Much less is sin taken away by works and 
efforts devised by men, such as ungodly worship, 


religiones, vows, pilgrimages: in short, it is not taken 
away by any works, but much more by the law. 


46 Lr. Oai. 1, 44-47. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1594-1597. 


47 





more increased by the same. For the more the saints of 
works strive and make themselves sore to take away sin, 
the worse it becomes with them. But it is taken away by 
grace alone, and by no other means. Therefore, Paul 
opposes grace and peace 2c. to sin and evil conscience 
every time in the greeting in all his epistles. One must 
pay very diligent attention to this. The words are easy, 
but in temptation it is very difficult to hold firmly in the 
heart that we have forgiveness of sins and peace with 
God through grace alone, and all other means that exist 
in heaven and on earth are excluded. 

The world does not understand this teaching. 
Therefore, it not only does not want to and cannot 
tolerate it, but also condemns it as heretical and godless. 
It praises free will, the light of reason, the uninjured state 
of the natural powers (naturalium), and good works by 
which it can earn and obtain grace and peace, that is, 
forgiveness of sins and a happy conscience. But it is 
impossible for the conscience to be satisfied and 
cheerful unless it has peace through this grace, that is, 
through the forgiveness of sin promised in Christ. 

(49) It is true that many have anxiously labored and 
invented various orders and exercises to calm their 
consciences. But in doing so, they have only sunk 
themselves into more and greater evil. For all these 
efforts serve only to increase doubt and despair. 
Therefore, there can be "no peace in my bones" and 
yours [Ps. 38:4] unless we hear the word of grace and 
lean on it constantly and faithfully; then the conscience 
will surely attain peace. 

50. but the apostle clearly distinguishes this grace 
and peace from all other grace and peace, because he 
does not call upon the emperor, kings and princes for 
grace and peace for the Galatians, for these commonly 
persecute the godly and "rebel against the Lord and His 
anointed," Ps. 2:2; nor the world, for "in the world," says 
Christ [Jn. 16:33], "you are afraid," but God our Father 
2c., the 





means, he wishes them the divine peace. So also Christ 
says [Joh. 14, 27.]: "Peace | leave you, my peace | give 
you. | do not give as the world gives." 

The peace of the world can grant nothing else than 
peace in body and goods, so that we can live happily and 
calmly in the flesh. Thus the grace of the world lets us 
enjoy our goods, does not throw us out of what we 
possess 2c. But in tribulation and in the hour of death, the 
grace and peace of the world cannot help us, cannot 
snatch us out of tribulation, despair or death. 

But when the grace and peace of God is in the heart, 
then man is strong, so that he is neither bowed down by 
adversities nor made arrogant by prosperity, but he walks 
the right middle road. For he receives the necessary 


strength (efficaciam) from Christ's victory over death, and 
in the certain confidence in it he begins to rule in his 
conscience over sin and death, for through him he has 
certain forgiveness of sins. Having received this, his 
conscience is quieted and straightened by the word of 
grace. Thus man, comforted and revived by the grace of 
God, that is, by the forgiveness of sins and this peace of 
conscience, can bravely endure and overcome all 
tribulations, yes, even death. This peace of God is not 
given to the world, because it neither desires it nor 
understands it, but to the believers, it is not obtained in 
any other way than by the grace of God alone. 


A rule that must be observed: one should 
abstain from musings on the divine 
* Majesty included. 


But why does the apostle add, "And of our Lord Jesus 
Christ"? Was it not enough to say: "From God, our 
Father"? Why then does he connect JEsum Christum 
with the Father? You have often heard us say that this 
rule in the Scriptures must be observed very carefully, 


that we should abstain from speculation about the divine 


majesty, which man cannot bear even in body, much less 
in his own body.

no spiritual beings (menti), "because", says the scripture 
[2 Mos. 33, 20.], "no man shall live who beholds me". 
(54) The pope, the Turks, the Jews and all saints of 
works do not follow this rule, therefore they put Christ the 
Mediator out of sight, speak only of God, pray, live and 
do everything before God [without Christ]. Thus a monk 
thinks: These works that | do are pleasing to God; these 
vows of mine God will look upon and make me blessed 
for their sake. A Turk thinks: If | do what is commanded 
in the Alkoran, God will accept me and give me eternal 
life; a Jew thinks: If | do what the law commands, | have 
a gracious God and will be blessed. Thus, nowadays, the 
enthusiasts who boast of the spirit, enlightenment, 
visions, and | don't know what other strange things, walk 
in whimsical things that are too high for them. These new 
monks 1) invent a new cross and new works, and dream 
that for their sake they please God. In short, as many as 
there are who do not know the article of justification, they 
take Christ, the Reconciler, out of the means, want to 
seize God in His majesty through the power of judgment 
of human reason, and want to please Him through works. 
But Christian and true theology does not hold God up 
to us in His majesty, as Moses and other teachings do, 
does not command us to investigate the nature of God, 
but that we should know His will, which He has presented 
to us in Christ. God willed that Christ should take on 


human nature (carnem), be born and die for our sins, and 
that this should be preached among all nations. For since 
God knew "that the world by its wisdom did not know God 
in His wisdom, it pleased God well to make blessed by 
foolish preaching those who believe in it" [1 Cor. 1:21]. 
Therefore, nothing is more dangerous when we have to 
deal with God in the struggle against the Law, against sin 
and against death, than to wander about in heaven with 
our musings and contemplate God Himself in His 


1) About the "new monks", the Anabaptists, compare Walch, St. Louis 
edition, vol. VII, 636, § ISO f. 





incomprehensible power, wisdom and majesty, how he 
created and rules the world. 2) If you want to take hold 
of God in such a way and make Him merciful without 
Christ the Atonement, and put yourself in the middle with 
your works, fasting, cap and plate, it cannot come 
otherwise than that you fall like Lucifer, and in terrible 
despair lose God and everything. For as God is 
immeasurable, incomprehensible and infinite in His 
essence, so He is unbearable to human nature. 

(56) Therefore, if you want to be secure and without 
danger of conscience and salvation, resist this tendency 


to inquire (sensum speculativum), and take hold of God, 
as Paul teaches you to take hold of Him, 1 Cor. 1:23 f.: 
"We preach Christ crucified, an offense to the Jews and 
foolishness to the Gentiles. But to those who are called, 
both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ, divine power 
and divine wisdom." Therefore begin where Christ 
Himself began, namely [as He lies] in the Virgin's womb, 
in the manger, at the breasts of the Mother 2c. For to this 
end he came down [from heaven], was born, walked 
among men, suffered, was crucified, and died, that he 
might in every way set himself before us, and direct the 
eyes of our hearts toward himself, thereby preventing the 
ascension to heaven and the enquiry into the majesty. 

Therefore, if you have to do with the doctrine of 
justification and debate how to find God who justifies or 
accepts sinners, where and how he must be sought, then 
you must know of no other God except this man Jesus 
Christ. Take hold of him and cling to him with all your 
heart, and let the brooding of the majesty stand still, for 
he who wants to explore the majesty will be crushed by 
its glory. | know it and have experienced what | say. But 
the gushing people, who deal with GOD without the 
mediator Christ, do not believe me. Chri-

in our edition of the Table Talks.

W. vm, i6vi-isvi. 





Jesus himself says, John 14:6: "| am the way, and the 
truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but 
by me. Therefore, apart from this way, Christ, you will 
find no other way to the Father, but error; not truth, but 
hypocrisy and lies; not life, but eternal death. Therefore, 
be well aware that in the matter of justification, where we 
all have to deal with the law, sin, death, the devil, and the 
overcoming of all evil, no other God is to be known than 
the incarnate and human God. 

If you have to dispute with Jews, Turks or heretics 
about the wisdom and power of God outside of this 
doctrine of justification, then use all your art and be as 
sharp and subtle a disputant as you can, for there it is 
about something else. But in the matter of conscience, 
righteousness, life (| want to emphasize this with special 
emphasis), against the law, sin, death and the devil, or 
in this matter, since it is about satisfaction, about the 
forgiveness of sins, about reconciliation, about eternal 
bliss, turn your mind completely away from all thoughts 
and musings of the majesty, and look solely at this man, 
who presents himself to us as mediator and says [Matth. 
11:28], "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden. "2c. If you do this, then you will see the love, the 
goodness, the kindness of God, you will see God's 
wisdom, power and majesty sweetly presented and 
adapted to your understanding, and you will find 
everything in this beautiful image according to the words 
of Paul to the Colossians, Cap. 2, 3: "All the treasures of 
wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ," likewise [v. 
9]: "In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." 
This the world does not know. Therefore, without the 
promise of Christ, it searches for the will of God, which 
can only be to its greatest harm. For "no one knows the 
Father except the Son, and to whom the Son wills to 
reveal it" [Matth. 11, 27]. 

59. and this is why Paul so frequently 





He commands us to step out of the ladder of Jacob, from 
which God Himself stands on top, whose lower end 
(pedes) touches the earth next to the head of Jacob. He 
commands us to step out of the ladder of Jacob, from 
which God Himself stands above, whose lower end 


(pedes) touches the earth next to the head of Jacob 
[Gen. 28, 12. f.]. 

60. Therefore, if you want to think and do something 
in regard to your blessedness, then leave all musings 
about the majesty, renounce all thoughts of works, 
statutes, leave philosophy and even the divine law 
aside, Run to the manger and to the womb of the mother 
and take hold of this child, the son of the Virgin, look at 
him as he is born, sucks [his mother's breast], grows, 
walks among men, teaches, dies, rises again, is exalted 
above all heavens, and has power over all things. In this 
way you can cause the clouds to be driven away from 
the sun, you can avoid all fear and also all error. And if 
you look at this, it will Keep you on the right track, so that 
you will be able to follow where Christ himself has gone. 
Thus, by desiring grace and peace, not only from the 
Father, but also from Jesus Christ, Paul teaches us first 
of all that we should refrain from meditating on the 
Godhead, for no one knows God; but that we should 
hear Christ, who is in the Father's bosom and reveals his 
will to us, who has also been appointed by the Father to 
be our teacher in this, so that we may all hear him. 


Christ is God by nature. 


The second thing that Paul teaches here serves to 
confirm our faith that Christ is true God. And such 
sayings about the deity of Christ should be collected 
diligently and good care should be taken, not only 
against the heretics, the Arians and others who have 
been or may yet come, but also to fortify ourselves, 
because Satan will not refrain from challenging all 
articles of faith in us before we die. He is the bitterest 
enemy of faith, because he knows "that faith is the 
victory that will win the 


52 Lri. Oai. 1, SI-S3. 


Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 1, 3. 4. W. VIII, 1604-I6V7. 5Z 





world overcomes". Therefore, we must make an effort 
that our faith may be sure, grow and be strengthened 
through diligent and unceasing handling of the Word and 
prayer, so that we may be able to resist Satan. 

1) 62. But that Christ is true God is clearly proven by 
the fact that Paul ascribes the same things to Him as to 
the Father, namely divine power, that He can give grace, 
forgiveness of sins, peace of conscience, life, victory 
over sin, death, the devil and hell. This Paul should not 
do at all, yes, it would be a theft of God, if Christ was not 
true God, as it is written [Is. 42, 8.]: "I will not give my 
glory to another." Then, no one gives to others what he 
does not have himself. But since Christ gives grace, 
peace, the Holy Spirit, delivers from the power of the 
devil, from sin and death, it is certain that he has infinite 
and divine power, equal in all things to the power of the 
Father. Christ also does not give grace and peace as the 
apostles bring grace and peace through the preaching 
of the Gospel, but He gives them as the Author and 
Creator. The Father creates and gives life, grace, peace 
2c. And this is what the Son creates and gives. 

(63) But such works as grace, peace, giving eternal 
life, remission of sins, justification, making alive, 
deliverance from death and the devil, are not works of 
any creature, but unique and only of the divine Majesty; 
even the angels can neither create nor bestow these. 
Therefore, these works belong only to the glory of the 
supreme Majesty, the Creator of all things. But since 
Paul ascribes to Christ the same and equal power with 
the Father to create and bestow all these things, it 
follows that he is truly and by nature God. 

64 There are many such reasons in John, where from 
the works that are attributed to the Son in the same way 
as to the Father, it is proven and irrefutably established 
that the Father is the Son. 


1) This and the next following paragraph is used by Aurifaber for 
Cap. 7, §2 of the Table Talks. In our edition of the Table Talks, this 
section has been omitted. Aurifaber uses here, as almost everywhere 
in his quotations from this explanation of the Brie to the Galatians, the 
translation of Justus Menius, but the same is often somewhat 
changed. 


that the Father and the Son have the same divine 


essence (divinitas). Therefore, we receive nothing 
different or no other gift from the Father than from the 
Son, but one and the same proceeds from the Father and 
from the Son. Otherwise Paul would have spoken 
differently, namely: grace from God the Father and peace 
from the Lord Jesus Christ; but he connects both and 
attributes it in the same way to both the Father and the 
Son. 

| remind you of this so diligently, because there is a 
danger that, with so many errors and so many different 
and so horrible heresies, heretics, Arians, Eunomians, 
Macedonians, might follow, who by their sophistry might 
harm the church. The Arians were indeed astute people; 
they admitted that Christ had two natures, that he was 
called God from the true God, but only in a supposed way 


(nuncupative) or in name. Christ is (they said) the noblest 
and most perfect creature, higher than the angels, 
through whom God created heaven and earth and all 
things. Mahomet also speaks gloriously of Christ. But 
these are nothing but thoughts that have a beautiful 
appearance, and words that are pleasant to human 
reason and find its applause, by which the gushing spirits 
beguile the people who are not on their guard. 

But Paul speaks differently of Christ. You are, he 
says, well founded and established in this knowledge, 
that Christ is not the most perfect creature, but true God, 
because he does the same things that God does; he has 
divine works, not of a creature, but of the Creator, 
because he gives grace and peace. But since he gives 
these, he thereby condemns sin, destroys death, 
tramples the devil under his feet. No angel can give such 
things. But since this is attributed to Christ, he must 
necessarily be God by nature. 


V. 4. who gave himself for our sins. 

67 Almost in every single word Paul has to do with 
what the whole letter is about; he lets nothing else be 
heard than that he speaks of Christ. Therefore, in each 
one 


54 Dri. "ai. i, 5A-ss> Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. viii, i""7-i 


55 





The words of the Spirit and the life. But be careful how 
clearly he speaks of it. He does not say, He who 
received from us our works; 1) not, He who received 
from us the sacrifices of the Mosaic law, worship, 
masses, vows, pilgrimages 2c., but, "He gave." What? 
Not gold, not silver, not oxen, not Passover lambs, not 
an angel, but Himself. For whom? Not for a crown, not 
for a kingdom, not for our holiness or righteousness, but 
for our sins. These words are nothing but thunderbolts 
from heaven against all righteousness, just as this 
saying John 1:29: "Behold, this is God's Lamb, which 
bears the sin of the world." Therefore, every single word 
is to be regarded with the greatest care, not just looked 
at coldly and carelessly passed over; for they 
wonderfully comfort and fortify the fearful mind. 

2) 68. Here the question arises, how can we obtain 
forgiveness of sins, both the sins that other people have 
and those that we ourselves have upon us? Paul 
answers that the man who is called Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God, gave himself for them. These are glorious 
and comforting words, which are also promised in the 
old covenant, that our sins will not be taken away in any 
other way than through the Son of God, who passed 
away into death. With such crude weapons, tools of war 
and battering rams, the papacy must be destroyed, and 
all religions of all pagans, all false worship of God, all 
works and merits. For if our sins could be atoned for by 
our works, atonements and merits, what need would 
there have been for the Son of God to be given for them? 
But since he was given for them, we will certainly not 
erase them by our works. 

69 Furthermore, this statement also 


1) Here we have adopted rsesxit with the Jena and Erlangen, 
instead of reeipit in the Wittenberg, 
2) Aurifaber introduced the three following paragraphs as Luther's 
table speeches (in Cap, 9, U 7-9) with the words: "When someone 
asked how he should be treated for his sins, ... said D. Martin." In our 
edition of the Table Talks, these three paragraphs are omitted. 


that our sins are so great, immeasurable and 
insurmountable that it is impossible for the whole world 
to do enough for just one. And surely the greatness of 
the price, namely Christ, the Son of God, "who gave 
Himself for our sins," shows sufficiently that we cannot 
do enough for sin nor rule over it. The power and 
authority of sin is made very great by these words: "Who 
gave Himself for our sins". Therefore, one must consider 
the greatness and (that | say so) the infinity of the price 
that was paid for it. Then it will become perfectly clear 
that the power and violence of sin was so great that it 
could not be erased by any work, but that the Son of God 
had to be given for it. Whoever considers this well 
understands that the word "sin" comprehends in itself the 
eternal wrath of God and the whole kingdom of Satan, 
and that sin is something more terrifying than can be 
expressed in words. This should certainly go to our 
hearts and frighten us so much that it would go through 
our marrow. But we take little notice of it; indeed, we 
despise sin as something trivial that has no significance. 
And even if we feel remorse, we think that the sin is not 
so great; we would like to be able to eradicate it by a 
small work or a merit. 

(70) So this saying testifies that all men are captives 
and slaves of sin, and as Paul says elsewhere [Rom. 
7:14.Likewise, that sin is the most cruel and powerful 
tyrant over all men in the whole world, which cannot be 
overcome nor cast out by any power of all creatures, 
whether they be angels or men, but only by the infinite 
and superior power of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who 
gave Himself for sin. 

(71) Furthermore, this text offers immeasurable 
comfort to all consciences that are terrified by the 
greatness of sin. For however insurmountable the tyrant, 
sin, may be, it cannot harm those who believe in Christ, 
because he has overcome it by his death. Then, when 
we, armed with this faith, are able to face this 


56 ti. 1,58-57. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 1, 4. w. vill, 1610-1613. 


57 





When we hear that the tyrant, sin, has power over all] She has nothing to do with us, unless she is pure and 
men and that the whole world is subject to him, we} without sins beforehand. Therefore, when she reads and 


immediately conclude, and no one can escape this 
conclusion: The tyrant, sin, has power over all men and 
that the whole world is subject to him. For when we hear 
that the tyrant, sin, has power over all men, and that the 
whole world is subject to him, we immediately conclude, 
and no one can escape this conclusion: What then do 
the papists, monks, nuns, priests, Mahometists, 
Anabaptists, and all the works-saints, who with their 
statutes, preparations, amends, 2c. want to eradicate 
and overcome sin? Then we immediately judge that all 
these sects are ungodly and corrupt, since through them 
God's and Christ's honor is not only obscured, but 
completely annulled, while our honor is glorified and 
established. 

But consider carefully every single word of Paul, and 
especially notice and insist with all your might on this 
little word: "for ours. For this is the whole point of using 
the pronouns, which occur very frequently in the 
Scriptures, correctly and well, for there is always a great 
emphasis on them, and by them is indicated what is to 
be especially remembered. You can easily say and 
believe that Christ, the Son of God, was given for the 
sins of Peter, Paul and other saints whom we judge to 
be worthy of this grace. But it is very difficult for you, who 
must deny yourself this grace and say that you are 
unworthy of it, to say and believe from your heart that 
Christ was given for your insurmountable, infinite and 
immeasurable sins. 

(73) Therefore, it is easy to praise and extol Christ's 
good deeds in general and without the pronoun, in 
splendid and high words, that he was given for sins, but 
for the sins of others who were worthy of him; but when 
the pronoun "our" is to be added, our weak nature and 
reason will not accept it. Then it does not dare to 
approach GOtte, nor even to refer to itself this promise 


hears this text: "Who gave himself for our sins", or the 
like, she does not apply the pronoun "our" from herself, 
but refers it to others who are worthy and holy. But she 
herself wants to wait until she becomes worthy by her 
works. 

(1) (74) This is nothing other than that human reason 
would like the power of sin to be neither greater nor more 
powerful than it can dream. Hence it is that hypocrites 
who do not know Christ, even when they feel remorse 
over sin, still think they can easily do away with it by their 
works and merits. And though they do not say it, yet they 
cherish the wish that these words, "Who gave himself for 
our sins," should be words spoken with great humility, 
and that their sins should not be serious and true sins, 
but unfounded and fictitious. 

In short, human reason would like to present to God 
only a fictitious and pretended sinner, who would not be 
frightened at all, who would not feel the sin. It would like 
to bring to him a healthy person who does not need a 
doctor, and then, not feeling the sin, it would like to 
believe that Christ was given for our sins. 

The whole world is like this, and especially those 
people who want to be more godly and holy than others 
in the world, as they dream, namely the monks and all 
the saints of works. They confess with their mouths that 
they are sinners, they also confess that they commit sins 
every day, but not so tremendously great and many that 
they should not be able to redeem them with their works. 
Yes, beyond that they still want righteousness and merit

They will bring their sins to the throne of Christ and 
demand eternal life from the judge as retribution for 
them. But in the meantime, as they are humble brothers, 
so as not to be completely pure, they invent some sins, 
so that they can pray for their forgiveness with the tax 
collector out of great devotion: "God, be merciful to me, 
a sinner! [Luc. 18, 13.] For these, Paul's words "for our 
sins" are quite devoid of content and empty talk. 
Therefore, they do not understand them, and when they 
feel their sin seriously, they cannot take comfort from 
them, but have to despair. 


This, therefore, is the highest knowledge (scientia) 

and the right Christian wisdom, that these words of Paul 
should be considered serious and quite true, namely, 
that Christ was given into death, not for the sake of our 
righteousness or holiness, but for the sake of our sins, 
which are real, great, many, even infinite and 
insurmountable sins. Therefore, do not imagine that they 
are trifling, so that they can be blotted out by your works. 
But do not despair because of their greatness if you feel 
them seriously, whether in life or in death, but learn here 
from Paul that you believe that Christ was given, not for 
imaginary or painted sins, but for real sins, not for small 
sins, but for the very greatest ones, not for one or the 
other, but for all of them, not for the sins that have been 
overcome (for no man, not even an angel, can overcome 
even the very smallest sin), but for the sins that are 
insurmountable. And if you are not found in the number 
of those of whom it is said: "ours", that is, who have this 
doctrine of faith, teach it, hear it, learn it, love it and 
believe it, then your blessedness is over. 
78. Therefore, make every effort that not only in times of 
temptation, but also in danger and in the battle of death, 
when the conscience is frightened by the memory of past 
sins, and the devil attacks you with great impetuosity, 
and wants to overwhelm you with the force, the flood, 
yes, the flood of sins, so that he frightens you, pulls you 
away from Christ and plunges you into despair, that you, 
| say, can then confidently say: Christ, Son of God, 





is not given for the holy and righteous, but for the 
unrighteous and sinners. If | were righteous and had no 
sin, | would have no need of the Atonement, Christ. Why 
then, O most perverse Satan, do you want to make me a 
saint and require righteousness from me, when | have 
nothing but sins, and sins that are real and exceedingly 
grave, not fictitious or trivial? Such are the sins against 
the first tablet, namely the greatest unbelief, doubt, 
despair, contempt of God, hatred of God, lack of right 
knowledge, blasphemy, ingratitude, misuse of the name 
of God, carelessness, overindulgence and contempt of 
the word of God 2c. 

79) Then | have also committed the sins against the 
second table, such as not honoring parents, not obeying 
the authorities, coveting the goods of another than his 
wife 2c. (although these are minor compared to the 
above-mentioned), and even if | have not committed a 
death, adultery, theft and other such sins against the 
second table by deed, | have nevertheless committed 
them in my heart. Therefore, | am a transgressor of all 
the commandments of God, and the multitude of my sins 
is so great that the skin of an ox could not contain them; 
indeed, there is no number of them, for | have sinned 
more, and the number of my sins is greater "than the 
sand of the sea" [Prayer of Manasseh, v. 9]. Above this, 
the devil is such a cunning thousand-artist that he can 
make the greatest sin even out of my good works and out 
of my righteousness. Since my sins are so serious, real, 
great, infinite, terrifying and insurmountable, and my 
righteousness does not benefit me before God, but 
rather harms me, therefore Christ, the Son of God, was 
given up to death for them, so that he might eradicate 
them and make me and all who believe this blessed. 

(80) Therein, then, lies the power to eternal 
blessedness, that these words be taken for earnest and 
true. | do not say this in vain. For | have often 
experienced, and still experience daily, how difficult it is 
to believe, especially in distress of conscience, that 
Christ was given, not for the saints, but for God. 


60 Dri. Uai. 1, 89-62. Explanation of Galatians 1, 4. W. VIII, 


right. Worthy and friends, but for the ungodly, sinners, 
unworthy and enemies, who deserve the wrath of God 
and eternal death. 

(81) Therefore, let us fortify our hearts with these and 
similar sayings of Scripture, so that when the devil 
accuses us, "You are a sinner, therefore you are 
condemned," we may be able to answer him: Because 
thou sayest that | am a sinner, therefore will | be justified 
and blessed. - Yes, you will be damned! - No; for | take 
refuge in Christ, "who gave himself for my sins". 
Therefore you, Satan, will do nothing by trying to frighten 
me by holding up the greatness of my sin to me, and so 
bring me into sadness, disbelief, despair, hatred, 
contempt and blasphemy against God. Yes, just by 
saying that | am a sinner, you give me the weapons 
against you in my hand, so that | can strangle and 
destroy you with your own sword, because Christ died 
for sinners. 

Then you yourself preach the glory of God to me, 
because you remind me of God's fatherly love for me, a 
wretched and condemned sinner, who "so loved the 
world that he gave his only begotten Son" 2c. [John 
3:16.] Likewise, as often as you reproach me for being 
a sinner, so often do you call to my remembrance the 
good deed of Christ my Savior, on whose shoulders, not 
mine, all my sins rest. For the Lord has laid all our 
iniquities upon him; likewise, for the iniquities of his 
people he hath afflicted him, Isa. 53:5, 8. Therefore, 
when thou reproachest me that | am a sinner, thou dost 
not terrify me, but comfortest me exceedingly. 

Whoever understands this art correctly could easily 
escape all the cunning attempts of the devil, who, by 
reminding man of his sin, drives him into despair and 
tortures him to death, if he does not meet and resist him 
through this divine art and wisdom, by which alone sin, 
death and the devil are overcome. But he who does not 
throw away the memory of sin, but holds on to it and 
troubles himself with his thoughts, namely, how he can 
get out of his sin. 





1616-1620. 61 


If a person wants to find counsel for himself by his own 
efforts or wait until his conscience has been made 
peaceful, he falls into Satan's snares, tortures himself 
miserably and is finally overcome by the persistence and 
frequency of the temptation. For the devil does not stop 
accusing the conscience. 

Against this temptation, one must use these words of 
Paul, with which he clearly and actually describes Christ, 
in this way: Christ is the Son of God and of the Virgin, 
given and dead for our sins. If the devil should bring 
another description of Christ here, say: Your description 
and what you describe are both wrong, therefore | do not 
accept this description. | do not say this in vain. | know 
why | urge so diligently that we should learn to describe 
Christ actually from the words of Paul. For Christ is in 


truth not a stern driver (exactor), but the propitiator for 
the sin of the whole world. 

85. Therefore, if you are a sinner, as we certainly all 
always are, do not imagine Christ as a judge sitting on 
the rainbow, 1) otherwise you will be frightened and 
despair; but grasp his right description, namely this: That 
Christ, the Son of God and of the Virgin, is such a 
person, who does not frighten, does not afflict, does not 
condemn us sinners, does not demand an account of us 
because of our shamefully spent life, but who gave 
Himself for our sins, and by one sacrifice took away the 
sins of the whole world, crucified them and destroyed 
them in Himself. 

Study this description diligently, and especially make 
the pronoun "our" your own [so that you know] that these 
three 2) syllables "our," taken in faith, also take away and 
blot out your sin completely, that is, that you know for 
certain that Christ has not only taken away the sins of 
some people, but also yours and the sins of the whole 
world. Although all men should not believe this, 
nevertheless this giving away has been done for the

62 Lri. "Li. 1, 62-V4. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1620-1623. 63 


Sins of the whole world. Therefore, your sins should not 
only be sins, but in truth your sins, that is, you should 
believe that Christ was not only given for the sins of 
others, but also for your sins. This hold fast without 
wavering, and in no way be dissuaded from this 
exceedingly lovely description of Christ, in which even 
the angels in heaven delight, namely, that Christ, 
according to his right, proper description, is not a Moses, 
not a driver, not an executioner, but the propitiator for 
our sins, who gives us grace, righteousness, and life, 
who gave himself, not for our merits, holiness, 
righteousness, blameless life, but for our sins. Christ 
does interpret the law, but that is not his real and main 
office. 

As far as the words are concerned, we know this and 
can speak of it, but in the battle, where the devil tends to 
darken Christ and to tear the word of grace out of the 
heart, we find out that we do not yet really know it. 
Whoever could then really describe Christ and magnify 
Him and regard Him as the most loving Savior and High 
Priest, and not as a severe judge, would have overcome 
all evil and would already be in the kingdom of heaven. 
But it is the most difficult thing that one can do this in 
battle. 

| speak this from experience. | am well acquainted 
with the devil's cunning plots, that he not only makes the 
law excessively great in order to frighten us, likewise that 
he knows how to make many and great beams out of 
one splinter, that is, that he can make hell out of what is 
not sin (for he is a marvelous artist in a thousand ways, 
to make sin great and to weigh down the conscience 
even with what is right and well done), but that he even 
uses the person of the mediator to frighten us. In the 
guise of the mediator, he suddenly gives our heart a 
hard blow and makes it completely despondent by citing 
some scripture or word of Christ, and shows himself to 
us as if he were the real Christ, and makes us cling to 
this illusion, so that the conscience is drawn to it. 





would swear that he is Christ, since he leads his opinion 
or word. 

Moreover, the slanderer uses this trick, that he holds 
up only a part of Christ, not the whole Christ, namely, 
that he is the Son of God, born man of the virgin. Then 
he suddenly attaches something foreign to it, that is, he 
holds up some word of Christ to us with which he 
frightens sinners, as in Luc. 13:3: "If you do not amend 
your ways, you will all perish. By thus sullying and 
corrupting the true description of Christ with poison, he 
brings it about that, although we believe Christ to be our 
mediator, in fact the troubled conscience feels and 
judges that he is a tyrant and a judge. If we are deceived 
by Satan in this way, we easily lose the exceedingly 
lovely image of Christ the High Priest and Savior; but if 
that is lost, we are no less terrified of him than of the 
devil himself. 

90 And this is the reason why | insist so strongly that 
you learn to describe Christ well and truly from these 
words of Paul: "Who gave himself for our sins. If he gave 
himself to die for our sins, then he is truly not a tyrant or 
a judge who will condemn us for our sins; he is not a 
man who grieves the weary, but who helps up the fallen, 
who reconciles and comforts the brokenhearted. 
Otherwise Paul would be lying when he says, "Who gave 
himself for our sins." When | describe Christ in this way, 
| describe Him rightly and grasp and have the true Christ. 
In the same way, | leave aside the musings about the 
divine majesty and cling to the humanity of Christ, and 
thus | learn to know the will of God rightly. There is then 
no terror, but only sweetness, joy 2c., and at the same 
time the light rises, which gives me right knowledge of 
God, of myself, of all creatures, and of all wickedness in 
the devil's realm 2c. 

We do not teach anything new, but old things, and 
what the apostles and all godly teachers have taught 
before us, we inculcate and strengthen. And yet, God 
would that we could imprint it and make it firm, 


64 cri. 6ai. 1, 6*-66. elabor. Explanation d. Galatians 1, 4. 


W. VIII, 1623-1626. 65 





so that we would like to have it not only in our mouths, 


but, well understood (bene meditata), deep in our hearts, 
and could use it especially in deathly distress. 


That he saved us from this present evil 
world. 


Also in these words Paul deals in truth with what 
constitutes the content of this whole epistle. He calls this 
whole world, as it was, is and will be, "the present world" 
in contrast to the future and eternal world. Then he calls 
it a "wicked world" because everything that is in this 
world is subject to the wickedness of the devil, who rules 
in the whole world. Therefore, the world is the devil's 
kingdom. For in it there is nothing but ignorance of God, 
contempt for God, blasphemy and hatred of God, as well 
as disobedience to all the words and works of God. In 
this realm and under its rule we are. 

Here you see again that no one can redeem sins by 
his works or his own powers, because this present world 
is evil and, as John says, "is in trouble. As many as there 
are in the world, they are the devil's captives, who must 
serve him and do everything according to his will. What 
use was it then that so many orders were instituted to 
blot out sins, that so many great and exceedingly 
burdensome works were devised, namely, to wear hard 
shirts, to beat the body with scourges, that the blood ran 
after them, to run in full armor 1) to St. James 2c.? You 
may do such things, but nevertheless this explanation 
remains: You are in this present and evil world, not in 
Christ's kingdom. If you are not in Christ's kingdom, it is 
certain that you belong to the devil's kingdom, that is, to 
the evil world. Therefore, all the gifts you have, spiritual 
and physical, such as wisdom, righteousness, holiness, 
eloquence, power, beauty, wealth, are tools and servile 
weapons of this infernal tyranny, and with all these you 
must serve the devil and promote and increase his 
kingdom. 


1) Wittenberger wrong: insrmis instead of in Sinais. 


First, by your wisdom you obscure the wisdom and 
knowledge of Christ and deceive people with ungodly 
teaching so that they cannot come to the grace and 
knowledge of Christ. You praise and extol your own 
righteousness and holiness, but the righteousness and 
holiness of Christ, by which alone we are made righteous 
and alive, you utterly abhor and condemn as ungodly 
and devilish. Furthermore, by your power you destroy the 
kingdom of Christ, misuse it to wipe out the gospel with 
it, persecute and kill the servants of Christ along with all 
who hear them 2c. Therefore this wisdom of yours, if you 
are apart from Christ, is twofold foolishness, your 
righteousness twofold sin and ungodliness, because it 
does not know the wisdom and righteousness of Christ, 
and moreover obscures, hinders, blasphemes and 
persecutes them. 

Therefore Paul rightly calls the world a bad world, 
because it is worst when it is best. In the spiritual, wise 
and learned 2c. the world is at its best, but in fact and 
truth it is doubly evil. | will not say anything now about 
the gross offenses against the second table, as there are 
disobedience against the parents, against the authorities 
2c., adultery, fornication, avarice, theft, murder, envy, 
bitter hatred, in which the world is completely drowned. 
But these are only small sins when compared with the 
wisdom, righteousness 2c. of the wicked, with which they 
contend against the first table. The white devil, who 
drives men to spiritual sins, which one should accept for 
righteousness, is far more harmful than the black devil, 
who only drives to carnal sins, which the world also 
recognizes for sins. 

96 With these words, "That he might save us," 2c, 
Paul shows what this whole letter is about, namely, that 
grace and Christ are necessary, and that no creature, 
neither man nor angel, can save man from this evil world. 
For these are works of the divine majesty alone, which 
are not in the power of man or angel, that Christ hath put 
away sin, and delivered us out of the tyranny and 
dominion of the devil, that is, out of the wicked world, 
which is an abomination. 


66 Lri. Sai. 1, 66-ss. Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1626-1829. 67 


is an obedient slave and willing imitator of their god, the 
devil. Everything that this murderer and father of lies 
does and says, his extremely obedient son, the world, 
imitates most perfectly and also accomplishes it. 
Therefore it knows nothing about God, is full of hatred, 
lies, error, blasohemy and contempt against God; then 
also full of gross sins, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, 
robbery, because it follows its father, the devil, who is a 
liar and murderer [John 8:44]. And the wiser, righteous, 
and holier people are apart from Christ, the more they 
harm the gospel. So we also, who were in a spiritual 
state, before the light of the gospel, were twofold wicked 
and ungodly in the ministry, but under the name of 
godliness and holiness. 

97. But you must also let these words of Paul be 
sincere and true words, not take them for made-up or 
invented ones, namely, that the present world is bad. Do 
not be misled by the fact that most people have much 
more glorious virtue, that there is so much apparent 
holiness among the hypocrites, but rather pay attention 
to what Paul says, from whose words you can make this 
statement against the world quite freely and with the 
utmost certainty, that the world with all its wisdom, 
righteousness and power is the kingdom of the devil, 
from which alone God can save us through His only 
begotten Son. 

Therefore, we should praise God the Father and 
thank Him for His immeasurable mercy in delivering us 
from the devil's kingdom, in which we were held captive, 
through His Son, since it was impossible that this could 
have happened through our powers. And at the same 
time we want to confess with Paul that all our works and 
righteousness are only shame and dirt, with all of which 
we could not even touch a hair of the devil. 

We also trample underfoot all the power of free will, 
all Pharisaic wisdom and righteousness, all religious 
orders, masses, holy orders, vows, fasting, hard shirts, 
2c. and spit on them as the most abominable filthy 
garment and the most pernicious poison of the devil. 
Against this we want 


clearly bring to light and glorify the glory of Christ, who by 
his death has saved us not merely from the world, but 
from the wicked world. 


100. For by this epithet, that he calls the world a bad 
one, Paul indicates that the kingdom of the world or of the 
devil is a kingdom of ungodliness, ignorance, error, sin, 
death, blasphemy, despair and eternal damnation; On 


the other hand, it follows from the antithesis (per 
antithesin) that the kingdom of Christ is a kingdom of 


justice (aequitatis), a kingdom of light, grace, forgiveness 
of sins, peace, comfort, blessedness and eternal life, into 
which we have been translated through our Lord Jesus 
Christ. To Him be glory forever and ever, Amen. 


According to the will of God and our 
Father. 


Paul arranges all his words in such a way that they 
argue against the false apostles for the article of 
justification. Christ, he says, has saved us from this 
exceedingly wicked realm of the devil and the world, and 
this he has done according to the will, pleasure and 
command of the Father. Therefore we are not saved by 
our will or running, not by our counsel or will, but by God's 
mercy and good pleasure, as is also written elsewhere [1 
John 4:9, 10]: "In this appeared the love of God toward 
us, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent 
his only begotten Son to be a propitiation for our sins." 
That we are saved from the wicked world is pure grace, 
not our merit. Paul is so abundant and fervent in the 
exaltation of grace that he also sharpens every single 
word and judges it against the false apostles. 

There is another reason why Paul mentions the will of 
the Father here, which is also indicated everywhere in the 
Gospel of John, where Christ, praising His ministry, refers 
us to the will of the Father, that in His words and works 
we should not regard Him as well as the Father. For 
Christ came into the world and took upon Himself human 
nature so that He might 


68 Lri. 6 "i. i, 69-71. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 1, 4-6. 


W. vni, iW-iM. 69 





the sacrificial lamb for the sins of the whole world, thus 
reconciling us to the Father, and he alone revealed to us 
that this was done by the Father's gracious will, so that, 
with our eyes fixed on Christ, we might be drawn and led 
straight to the Father. 

For, as | have reminded you above [53 ff.], one must 
not think that by brooding over the majesty one can 
know anything salvific about God, unless one takes hold 
of Christ, who, according to the will of the Father, gave 
Himself to death for our sins. When you recognize this 
will of God in Christ, you no longer see any wrath, fear 
and trembling cease, and there is no other God to be 
seen but only the merciful God, who out of premeditated 
counsel wanted His Son to die for us so that we might 
live through Him. This realization makes the heart glad, 
so that it certainly believes that God did not intend to be 
angry, but to love us wretched sinners so much that He 
gave His only begotten Son for us. Therefore, it is not 
without reason that Paul inculcates that Christ was given 
for our sins according to the will of the Father. 

On the other hand, the musings about the majesty, 
about the terrible judgments of God, namely, how he 
destroyed the whole world through the flood of sin, how 
he destroyed Sodom 2c., are dangerous and finally 
plunge people into despair and complete ruin, as | have 
indicated above [§55]. 


God and our Father. 


The word "our" is to be referred to both, so that the 
opinion is: Our God and our Father. The same is 
therefore the Father of Christ and our Father. So Christ 
also says Joh. 20, 17. to Mary Magdalene: "Go to my 
brothers and tell them: | ascend to my Father and to your 
Father, to my GOD and to your GOD." So GOtt is our 
Father and our GOtt, but through Christ. And this is an 
apostolic and quite Pauline way of speaking, for Paul, 
though he uses words that have no great appearance, 
yet speaks in the most appropriate and powerful way. 





V. 5. To whom be glory forever and 
ever! Amen. 

The Hebrews have the habit of interspersing 
expressions of praise and thanksgiving in their writings. 
This habit is also observed by the apostles, who are also 
Hebrews, as can often be seen in Paul. For one must hold 
the name of the Lord in the highest honor and never 
mention him without praise and thanksgiving. And this 
custom is a kind of reverence and veneration, as we are 
wont to do in the secular regiment, where, when we call 
the names of kings or princes, we accompany it with a 


reverential gesture, bowing of the head (reverentia) and 
bending of the knees. Much more, when we speak of 
God, we must bend the knees of the heart and call the 
name of God with gratitude and highest reverence. 


V. 6. I am surprised. 


Here you see Paul's art and subtlety in dealing with 
his fallen Galatians who were deceived by the false 
apostles. He does not attack them with fierce and harsh 
words, but speaks to them in a truly fatherly manner, not 
only bearing their case patiently, but also almost 
excusing it. Then he embraces them with motherly love 
and speaks to them tenderly, but in such a way that he 
also punishes them at the same time, but with very 
chosen words that are wisely adapted to this matter. 
Against this he is fierce and full of indignation against the 
false apostles. He is full of indignation against the false 
apostles, their seducers, on whom he puts all the blame. 
Therefore, in the very beginning of the epistle, he goes 
out against them with loud thunderbolts and lightnings, 
saying [v. 9]: "If any man preach the gospel unto you," 
2c., "let him be accursed." And further on, Cap. 5, 10, he 
threatens them with judgment: "He that maketh you to err 
shall bear his judgment, whosoever he will." Furthermore, 
he curses them [Cap. 5:12] with very frightening words: 
"Would to God that they also were cut off who disturb 
you." These are truly terrible flashes against the 
righteousness of the flesh or the law. 

108. He could also have treated the Galatians 
themselves a little more unkindly and hit them harder, in 
this way: O, what a 


70 Lri. 6ai. 1, 71-73. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1633-1636. 


71 





shameful trash! | am ashamed of you. Your ingratitude 
pains me, | must be angry with you! Or he could have 
exclaimed, as happens in tragedies: O terrible times! O 


horrible customs! 2c. (0 saecula, o mores!) But because 
he is concerned with raising up the fallen and bringing 
them back from their error to the pure gospel, he deals 
with them as a father does with his children, refraining 
from such excessive harshness, especially at the 
beginning, and addressing them with the most tender 
and gentle words. For since he wanted to heal the 
wounded, it would not have been beneficial if he had 
only made the newly inflicted wound worse by applying 
an unsuitable remedy and thus hurt the wounded more 
than healed them. Therefore, he could not have chosen 
amore suitable word from among the gentle words than: 
"lam surprised,” by which he expresses that he is sorry, 
and yet he is displeased that they have fallen away from 
him. 

(109) And here Paul is mindful of the precept which 

he afterwards gives in the sixth chapter, v. 1, where he 
says: "Beloved brethren, if a man be overtaken in any 
fault, restore him with a gentle spirit, ye that are spiritual. 
This example we should also imitate, that we should be 
to poor and deceived disciples as parents are to their 
children, that they may recognize our fatherly zeal and 
motherly affection for them, and see that we seek not 
their ruin but their blessedness. But against the devil and 
his servants, the authors of seduction and rottenness, 
according to the apostle's example, we are not to 
exercise patience, to be proud, harsh, and unforgiving, 
and to most sharply traverse, curse, and condemn their 
deceitfulness and deception. In the same way, parents, 
when their child is bitten by a dog, only pursue the dog, 
but they caress the crying child and comfort it with the 
sweetest words. 
Therefore, in Paul there is a spirit that knows wonderfully 
well how to treat the fallen and afflicted consciences 
rightly. On the other hand, the pope, being driven by the 
spirit of wickedness, tyrannically goes through, hurling 
only thunderbolts and curses against the 


Wretched and frightened, as can be seen from his bulls, 


especially the one on Maundy Thursday (coenae). And 
the bishops do not direct their office any better, they do 
not teach the Gospel, they do not care about the 
salvation of souls, but only seek to rule. Therefore, they 
speak and do everything only in such a way that they 
strengthen this dominion and keep it intact. All teachers 
who seek vain honor are of the same mind 2c. 


That you so soon. 


You see that Paul himself complains about how easy 
it is to fall in faith. Therefore he admonishes the 
Christians elsewhere [1 Cor. 10:12], "Let him that 
standeth take heed lest he fall." We also experience 
daily how difficult it is for the heart to gain and keep a 
firm faith; likewise, with how great difficulty a prepared 
people is prepared for the Lord [Luc. 1:17]. It takes ten 
years of work before a congregation is prepared in a 
right and Christian way, and when it is prepared, some 
fool creeps in who knows nothing but to revile those who 
teach the word pure and true; such a one overthrows 
everything in a moment. Who would not be outraged by 
this evil? 

By the grace of God, we have established a Christian 
congregation here in Wittenberg in the right form; the 
Word is taught purely among us, the sacraments are in 
the right use, exhortations are going forth, prayers are 
also being said for all classes, in short, everything is 
flourishing. This very happy course of the Gospel could 
soon be hindered by some enthusiastic person, and he 
would like to overthrow in a moment what we have built 
up with great labor over many years. 

This is what happened to Paul, the chosen 
instrument of Christ. He had prepared the churches in 
Galatia with great care and labor; after his departure, the 
false apostles turned them around in a short time. This 
is testified by this his present epistle, also by others 2c. 
So weak and miserable it goes in this life, and so even 


72 L>-| vai. 1, 73-76. Exec. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 1, 6. W. VIII, 1636-1640. 7Z. 





We are walking in the midst of Satan's ropes, that a 
single swarm spirit can destroy and overthrow in such a 
short time what many right preachers have built up over 
a number of years through laborious work day and night. 
We learn this today from experience to our great 
heartache, but still cannot remedy this evil. 

Because the church is something so soft and delicate 
and is so easily perverted, one must be on one's guard 
against these swarming spirits, who, when they have 
only heard a few sermons or read a few pages in the 
Holy Scriptures, immediately proclaim themselves 
masters over all, over disciples and teachers, against all 


who are in office (contra omnium autoritatem). You 
can find quite a number of such people today, even 
among the craftsmen, foolish people who, not having 
been tested by any temptations, have never learned to 
fear God, have never tasted grace in the slightest. 

Because they are without the spirit [of God], they 
teach what pleases them, and what is easy for the mob. 
Then the inexperienced rabble immediately falls to 
them, who are eager to hear new things. Yes, even 
many who think that they have grasped the doctrine of 
faith well, and are to some extent tempted by 
temptations, are deceived by them. 

Since Paul teaches us here from his own experience 
that the churches, which have been prepared with great 
labor, are easily and soon perverted, we must watch 
with the greatest care against the devil who walks about, 
lest he come while we sleep and sow tares among the 
wheat. The Christian flock is threatened with danger 
from Satan, even if the shepherds are still so watchful 
and brave. For Paul, as | have said, had planted the 
churches in Galatia with the greatest effort and 
faithfulness, and no sooner had he (as they say) set foot 
outside the gate than the false apostles nevertheless 
perverted some of them, the fall of which later brought 
about such tremendous devastation in the churches of 
the Galatians. This sudden and so great harm is no 
doubt due to the dear apostle. 


more bitter than death. Therefore let us watch with all 
diligence, first of all, each one for himself, and then also 
the teachers, not only for themselves but also for the 
whole church, so that we may not fall into temptation. 


Let turn away. 


Again, he does not use a harsh word, but a gentle 
one. He does not say: | am surprised that you have fallen 
away so soon, that you are so disobedient, careless, 
fickle, ungrateful, but that you "let yourselves be turned 
away" so soon, as if he wanted to say: You are only 
suffering, you have not done harm, but have suffered 
harm. In order to win back the fallen, he accuses the 
turners rather than the turned away. But at the same 
time he punishes them, although with great modesty, 
since he complains that they have turned away, as if he 
wanted to say: Although | love you dearly, as a father 
loves his children, and know that you have fallen, not 
through your fault, but through the fault of the false 
apostles, yet | might have wished that you had shown a 
little more firmness in right doctrine. You have not 
grasped the word sufficiently, you are not firmly enough 
founded. That is why you let yourselves be turned away 
so soon by a slight breeze and a small wind. 

Jerome is of the opinion that Paul wanted to translate 
the word "Galatians" by alluding to the Hebrew word 
XXX he is turned away, as if he wanted to say: You are 
right Galatians by name and by deed, that is: turned 
away. 

Some think that we Germans are descended from 
the Galatians, and this assumption is perhaps not 
without reason. For we Germans have a character not 
very dissimilar to that of the Galatians, and | must say 
that | wish our compatriots had a little more firmness and 
consistency. For in all things we are exceedingly hot- 
tempered in the first beginning. But as soon as the heat 
of the first excitement has passed away, we soon 
become all too casual, and with the same haste 


(temeritate) with which we begin things, we throw them 


from us again and leave them pending. At first, when 
after the great darkness of the human statutes 


74 Lri. i, 76-78. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, i64v-i643. 


When the light of the gospel went out, many were 
engaged in a Christian way of life, listened to the 
sermons with great eagerness, and held the ministers of 
the word in honor. But now that the Word has progressed 
so well, and the Christian doctrine has been so well 
purified, many become despisers and enemies of the 
Word, who not only stop studying the Word and neglect 
the ministers of the Word, but also hate all other good 
arts and sciences, and become utterly swine and vile 
servants, who are well worthy to be compared to the 
"unintelligent" Galatians [Gal. 3:1, 3]. 


From Him who called you into the grace 
of Christ. 


120 This passage is somewhat ambiguous, for it can 
be construed in two ways; first, from Christ who called 
you to grace; second, from him, namely, God, who called 
you to the grace of Christ. | accept the former version. 
For it pleases me that Paul, just as he said shortly before 
about Christ that he is the Redeemer who sets us free 
from this evil world through his death, likewise that he 
gives us grace and peace in the same way as God the 
Father gives us grace and peace, so also here he 
attributes to him that he calls us to grace. For this is 
Paul's way of first and foremost impressing upon us the 
good deed of Christ, through which we come to the 
Father. 

(121) There is also an emphasis and contrast in 

these words, "From Christ who called you into grace," as 
if to say: Oh how easily you are torn and turned away 
from Christ, who called you, not to law, works, sin, wrath, 
condemnation, like Moses, but to pure grace. 
(122) So also we complain today with Paul that the 
blindness and perversity of men is quite frightening, that 
no one wants to receive the doctrine of grace and 
salvation, or, even if a few receive it, they soon fall away 
from it again, although it brings with it all goods, spiritual 
and corporal, namely forgiveness of sins, true 
righteousness, peace of heart and eternal life. Then it 
brings us light 





75 


and gives us a certain judgment on all doctrine and all 
status, approves and confirms the world regime, the 
household and all statuses that God has established and 
ordered. It destroys the doctrines that give rise to error, 
sedition and confusion 2c. In short, it exposes all cunning 
plots and works of the devil, and reveals God's 
benevolence and love towards us in Christ. What, O 
lamentation, is this frenzy that the world so bitterly hates 
this word, this gospel of eternal comfort, grace, 
blessedness and eternal life, blasphemes and persecutes 
it with such devilish fury! 

Paul calls the present world evil, that is, the kingdom of 
the devil; otherwise it would recognize the goodness and 
mercy of God. But because it is under the power of the 
devil, it surely despises and persecutes it with hostility, for 
it loves darkness, error and the devil's kingdom more than 
the light, truth and kingdom of Christ. And this it does not 
out of ignorance or error, but out of! devilish malice. This 
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that Christ, the Son of 
God, by giving Himself to death for the sins of all men, can 
earn nothing else from the perverse and godless world 
than that it blasphemes Him for this immeasurable good 
deed, persecutes His saving word and would gladly crucify 
Him once more, if only it could. Therefore, the world not 
only walks in darkness, but is also darkness itself, as it is 
written in John 1:5. 

Therefore Paul makes these words great: "Of Christ 


who called you" 2c., and covertly urges the antithesis 


(anti-thesin) of them, as if he said, "My preaching was not 
of the hard laws of Moses, neither did | teach you to be 
servants under the yoke; but pure grace and freedom from 
the law of sin 2c. | preached to you that Christ mercifully 
called you into grace, that you might be children under 
Christ, not servants under Moses, whose disciples you 
have now become again at the instigation of your false 
apostles, who by the law of sin have been the disciples of 
Moses. 


76 Dr! 1, 78-80. Explanation of the Galatian Epistle 1, 6, W. VIII, 1643-1647. 


Law of Moses does not call to grace, but to anger and 
hatred against God, to sin and death. But Christ's call is 
a call to grace and blessedness. For those who are 
called by Him obtain for the sad law the joyful gospel, are 
transferred from wrath to grace, from sin to 
righteousness, from death to life. And you let yourselves 
be swept away from such a living fountain, bubbling and 
overflowing with grace and life, so quickly and so easily? 
But if Moses by God's law calls to God's wrath and sin, 
to what do you think the pope will call us with his statutes 
of men? - The other understanding, that the Father calls 
to the grace of Christ, is also good, but the former of 
Christ is more lovely and more suitable to comfort 
sorrowful consciences. 


To another gospel. 


Here we are to learn the cunning tricks and cunning 
plots of the devil. No heretic comes under the name of 
error and the devil, and even the devil himself does not 
come as the devil, especially the white devil. Yes, even 
the black devil, when he incites to public villainy, makes 
a blanket for man, that he may diminish the sin he wants 
to commit or commits. A murderer in his rage does not 
see that murder is such a great and terrible sin as it really 
is, because he has the blanket. Adulterers, thieves, 
misers, drunkards 2c. have their euphemisms and 
covers. So also the black Satan in all his works and 
attacks has a mask before and is made up. 

But in spiritual things, where not the black but the 
white Satan appears, pretending to be an angel and 
God, he surpasses himself in the most cunning disguise, 
in the most marvelous tricks he uses to deceive, and 
uses to sell his most harmful poison for the doctrine of 
grace, for God's word, for the gospel of Christ. Therefore 
Paul calls the teaching of the false apostles, the servants) 
of the devil, also a gospel, saying, "To another gospel," 
but ironically, as if to say: You Galatians now have other 





77 


Evangelists, you have another gospel, mine is now 
despised among you, no longer valid. 

From this it is easy to see that the false apostles 
condemned Paul's gospel among the Galatians, saying, 
"Paul began well, but it is not enough to have begun well, 
for there are still higher things left to be preached. 15, 1. 
They say: It is not enough to believe in Christ, it is not 
enough to be baptized, but you must also be 
circumcised; for "if you are not circumcised after the 
manner of Moses, you cannot be saved". But this much 
is said: Christ is a good carpenter, who began the 
building, but did not finish it, because Moses must do 
that. 

This is what the Anabaptists and others say 
nowadays, since they cannot condemn us outright: The 
Lutherans have the spirit of fear; they dare not freely 
confess the truth and tear it through. They have laid the 
foundation, that is, they have taught faith in Christ, but 
the beginning, the means and the end must be 
connected. This is not given to them by God, but to us. 
Thus the perverse and devilish people glorify their 
ungodly sermons and call them God's word, thereby 
deceiving many people under God's name. For the devil 
does not want to be ugly and black in his servants, but 
pure and white, and, in order to appear so, he presents 
all his words and works in such a way that he adorns 


them with the title (Oraetextu) of truth and the name of 
GOD. Hence arose among us Germans the well-known 
saying: In the name of God all misfortune is lifted up. 

Therefore, let us learn that this is the devil's trick, that 
when he cannot do harm by persecuting and destroying, 
he does it by making better and building. Thus he 
persecutes us today with force and sword, in order, when 
he has destroyed us, not only to darken the gospel, but 
to wipe it out completely. But so far he has done nothing, 
for he has killed many who have steadfastly confessed 
that these our 


78 dri. 6al. l> 80-83. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1647-1650. 


79 





Doctrine is holy and divine. By the blood of these 
[martyrs], however, the church is not destroyed but 


fertilized (rigata). Since he has achieved nothing in this 
way, the evil spirit instigates ungodly teachers who first 
approve our doctrine and teach it unanimously with us, 
but later say that it is our profession to present the first 
elements of Christian doctrine, but that the true secrets 
of Scripture have been revealed to them by God and that 
they are called to make them known to the world. 

(130) In this way Satan hinders the course of the 
gospel on the right and on the left. But on the right, as | 
said, he does much more harm by building and 
improving than on the left by persecuting and killing. 
Therefore, we must pray, read, and cling to Christ and 
His words without ceasing in order to overcome the 
cunning plots of the devil with which he attacks us on the 
right and on the left. "For we do not struggle with flesh 
and blood" 2c. Eph. 6, 12. 


V. 7. If there is no other, without some 
there are that confound you. 


Again, he excuses the Galatians and takes the false 
apostles to task, as if to say: Galatians, you have been 
persuaded that the gospel which you received from me 
is not the true and genuine gospel. Therefore, let it seem 
to you that you would do well to accept the new thing 
that the false apostles preach, which is supposed to be 
better than my gospel. | do not blame you for this 
misstep, nor do | blame those troublemakers who 
confuse your consciences and snatch you out of my 
hand. 

Here again you see how fierce and vehement the 
apostle is against those deceivers, and how 1) he goes 
through them with the harshest words, calling them 
destroyers of the churches and confounders of 
consciences, who do nothing but deceive and confuse 
countless consciences and cause terrible damage in the 
church. We too must see this great misery today with 
heavy heartache, and yet we can no more remedy it than 
Paul was able to do at that time. 


1) Wittenberger: quamquam instead of quamque. 





This passage gives evidence that the false apostles 
undoubtedly said of Paul that he was not a perfect 
apostle and that he was a weak preacher who was still 
in error. That is why he calls them again destroyers of 
the churches and transgressors of the gospel of Christ. 
Thus they condemned each other; the false apostles 
condemned Paul, and Paul in turn condemned the false 
apostles. 

Such disputes and condemnations have taken place 
in the church at all times, especially when the teaching 
of the Gospel is in full bloom, namely, that the godless 
teachers persecute, condemn, and oppress the godly, 
and the godly condemn the godless. The papists and 
the swarm spirits hate us today to the utmost and 
condemn our teachings as ungodly and erroneous; then 
they are also after our good and life. We, in turn, hate 
their godless and blasphemous doctrine with all our 


heart (perfecto odio) 2) and condemn the same. In the 
meantime, the poor people remain uncertain and waver 
and doubt where to turn, whom they can safely follow; 
for it is not given to anyone to judge such great matters 
in a Christian way. 

But at the end it will be seen which of the two teaches 
rightly and condemns the other rightly. It is certain that 
we persecute no one, oppress no one and kill no one. 
Nor does our teaching confuse the consciences, but 
frees them from countless errors and snares of the devil. 
For this we have the testimony of many pious people 
who thank God that they have drawn a firm comfort of 
conscience from our teaching. Just as it was not Paul's 
fault that the churches were confused, but the fault of 
the false apostles, so it is not our fault today, but the fault 
of Anabaptists, Sacramentans and other fanatics, that 
so many and so great disturbances arise in the church. 

(136) Note that everyone who teaches works and 
that righteousness is obtained from the law confuses the 
churches and the consciences. But who would ever 
have believed that 


2) In the Wittenberg: proksato instead of perteeto. 


80 Lri. "Al. 1, 83-85. Exec. Explanation of Galatians 1, 7. W. VIII, I65V-1653. 


81 





the pope, cardinals, bishops, monks and their whole 
school of Satan, especially the founders of the holy 
orders (some of whom God has miraculously made 
blessed) are such people who confuse the consciences? 
Yes, they are even worse than the false apostles. For 
they taught that in addition to faith in Christ, the works of 
the divine law were necessary for salvation. But they left 
out faith altogether and taught only human statutes and 
works, which God did not command, but which they 
themselves devised without and against God's word; and 
these they not only made equal to God's word, but also 
raised far above it. But the greater semblance of holiness 
the heretics have, the more harm they do. For if the false 
apostles had not had excellent gifts, great prestige and a 
beautiful appearance of holiness, and if they had not 
claimed to be servants of Christ, disciples of the apostles 
and righteous preachers of the gospel, they could not 
have so easily destroyed Paul's prestige and deceived 
the Galatians in such a way. 

But this is why he attacks them so vehemently and 
calls them people who confuse the churches, because 
they teach that apart from faith in Christ, circumcision and 
the observance of the law are necessary for salvation. 
Paul himself testifies to this later in chapter 5 [v. 1, 2], and 
Lucas in the Acts of the Apostles, chap. 15, 1, with these 
words: "that Some came down from Judea and taught the 
brethren, unless ye be circumcised after the manner of 
Moses, ye cannot be saved. Therefore the false apostles 
urged with great vehemence and obstinacy the keeping 
of the law. 1) They were soon joined by stubborn Jews 
who firmly insisted that the law must be kept, and then 
easily persuaded those who were not well established in 
the faith that Paul was not a righteous teacher because 
he neglected the law. For it seemed to them to be quite 
unpleasant that the Law of God should be completely 
abolished, and that the Jews, who had hitherto been 
God's people, and to whom the promises had been 
made, should not be allowed to keep the Law. 


1) Wittenberger; "UMmssrvAnaAioesse." The last two words are 
missing in the Jena and Erlangen versions. 





God were to be rejected. After that it seemed even more 
unpleasant to them that the Gentiles, the godless 
idolaters, without circumcision, without works of the law, 
only by grace and through faith in Christ should come to 
this glory and dignity, that they would be God's people 
2c. 

These things the false apostles have highly 
exaggerated in order to make Paul hated by the 
Galatians; and in order to make their hearts more bitter 
against him, they said that he preaches freedom from 
the law to the Gentiles, against the law of God, against 
the tradition of the whole Jewish people, against the 
example of the apostles, yes, against his own 
exemplum, by which he brings the divine law and the 
whole Jewish kingdom into contempt and brings it to 
nothing. Therefore, he must be shunned as a public 
blasphemer against God and a rebel against the whole 
Jewish regime; but they must be listened to because, 
besides teaching the gospel correctly, they were also 
disciples of the apostles, with whom Paul had never had 
any contact. In such a cunning way they disparaged 
Paul among the Galatians and caused the Galatians to 
fall away from him. So that the truth of the gospel would 
be preserved among the Galatians, he had to oppose 
the false apostles with all his might. He calls them, 
condemning them with the greatest confidence, 
confounders of the churches and destroyers of the 
gospel of Christ, as follows: 


And want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 


139 That is, they are not only to confuse you, but also 
to destroy and pervert the gospel of Christ from the 
foundation of the world. For Satan has to deal with these 
two things. First of all, he is not satisfied with confusing 
and deceiving many through his ungodly apostles, but 
then he also seeks through them to completely reverse 
and take away the gospel, and does not rest until he has 
accomplished it. However, such destroyers of the gospel 
can hear nothing less than that they are apostles of the 
devil, yes, they boast before others of the name of Christ 
and boast that they are the purest preachers of the 
gospel. 


82 Lri. 6ai. 1, 85-87. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1653-1657. 


83 





But because they mix the law with the gospel, they 
must be destroyers of the gospel. For either Christ will 
remain and the law will fall, or the law will remain and 
Christ will fall. For Christ and the law cannot in any way 
agree with each other, and cannot at the same time rule 
in the conscience. Where the righteousness of the law 
prevails, the righteousness of grace cannot prevail, and 
again, where the righteousness of grace prevails, the 
righteousness of the law cannot prevail. One must give 
way to the other. But if you cannot believe that God wants 
to forgive sins for the sake of Christ, whom He sent into 
the world to be our High Priest, dear one, how could you 
believe that He wants to forgive sins for the sake of the 
works of the Law, which you have never done, or for the 
sake of your works, which you must confess are such that 
you cannot possibly hold them up to the judgment of 
God? Therefore, the doctrine of grace cannot in any way 
stand with the doctrine of the law. The latter must be 
denied and rejected, but the former must be established. 
But just as the Jews had an abhorrence of the doctrine of 
faith and grace, so we also have an abhorrence of it. | 
would like to hold at the same time the righteousness of 
grace, which justifies, and also the other of the law, for 
which God should look upon me. But if one wants to mix 
these with the other, it means, as Paul says here, to 
pervert the gospel of Christ. And yet, when it comes to a 
dispute, the greater crowd retains the victory over those 
who are right. For Christ with His own is weak, and the 
gospel is a foolish sermon. On the other hand, the 
kingdom of the world and its prince, the devil, is strong; 
indeed, the prudence and righteousness of the flesh has 
an excellent appearance. And so the righteousness of 
grace and faith is lost, and the other, the righteousness 
of the law and of works, is destroyed and denied. But this 
is our consolation, that the devil cannot do what he wills 
with his members. He can confuse many people, but he 
cannot overthrow the gospel of Christ. The truth can 
indeed 





in danger, but it cannot perish. It will be stormed, but not 
stormed, because God's word remains forever. 

It seems to be a small thing that the gospel and the 
law, faith and works, are mixed together, but this does 
more harm than human reason can understand. For this 
not only obscures the knowledge of grace, but also 
removes Christ with all his benefits, and, as Paul says 
here, perverts the whole gospel. The cause of this great 
evil is our flesh, which, sunk in sins, sees no other way 
to free itself from them than by works. Therefore, the 
natural man (caro) wants to live in the righteousness of 
the law and confidently rely on his works. He therefore 
knows nothing of the doctrine of faith and grace, without 
which it is impossible to have a clear conscience. 

From these words of Paul: "And want to pervert the 
gospel of Christ", it can be clearly seen that the false 
apostles were very impudent and insolent people, who 
opposed Paul with such vehemence. Therefore he again 
confronts them most valiantly, trusting in his Spirit and in 


full assurance of faith (TAnpo- gopw", and against 


them powerfully (mirum in modum) exalts his ministry, 
saying: 


V. 8 But if we, or an angel from heaven, preach 
any other gospel to you than the one we preached to 
you, let him be accursed! 


Here Paul speaks with flames and is so inflamed that 
he begins to curse even the angels. Even we ourselves, 
he says, | and my brethren, Timothy, Titus, and as many 
as are theirs, who with me teach Christ purely (for | 
speak not yet of those who deceive souls), yea, if an 
angel from heaven 2c. [preach otherwise], | would rather 
that |, my brethren, yea, even an angel from heaven 
were accursed, than that my gospel should be 
perverted. This is indeed a burning zeal, that he should 
presume to curse so confidently not only himself and his 
brethren, but also an angel from heaven. 


84 Ari. OLi. 1, 87-90. Exec. Explanation of Galatians 1, 8. 9. W. VIII, 1657-1660.

145. ‘Avd@eua Ottegilp, Greek, Hebrew XXX 
means. 


Latin maledictum, cursed, rejected and absolutely 
excluded from intercourse, society and fellowship with 
God. Thus Joshua says [Cap. 6, 17. 26.] that the city of 
Jericho shall be banished forever, so that it shall never 
be built again. And in the 3rd book of Moses, Cap. 27, 
28, 29, it is written that if a man or any animal has been 
banished, the banished thing shall be put to death, and 
it shall not be allowed to live. Thus, Amalek and several 
cities that had been banished by God's judgment had to 
be completely exterminated. 

146 Therefore Paul's opinion is: | would rather that |, 
others, even an angel were accursed from heaven, than 
that another gospel be preached, whether by us or by 
others, than the one we have preached. So Paul 
banishes and curses himself first. For good workmasters 
are wont to punish themselves first, that they may 
afterwards punish others the more freely and severely. 

147 Paul concludes that there is no other gospel than 
the one he preached himself. He did not preach a gospel 
of his own devising, but the one that God had promised 
from the beginning through His prophets in the Holy 
Scriptures, Rom. 1:1, 2. Therefore, he states with the 
utmost certainty that he, others, even an angel from 
heaven, would be cursed if they preached a gospel 
different from the former one. For the word of the gospel, 
which God once sent forth, will not be revoked until the 
last day. 


V. 9 As we have said now, so we say again, If any 
man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye 
have received, let him be accursed. 


He repeats the same thing, but changes the persons. 
Above he cursed himself, his brothers, an angel from 
heaven; here he says: "If there are any others besides 
us who preach the gospel to you other than what you 
have received from us, let them also be cursed. 
Therefore he banishes and curses all teachers, himself, 
his brothers, 





one angel, and after that any others, namely, those who 
teach contrary to the gospel. The apostle has an 
exceedingly fierce zeal that he dares to curse all 
teachers in the whole world and in heaven who pervert 
his gospel and teach a different one. For all must believe 
the gospel 1) which Paul preached, or become a curse 
and be damned. God would that this frightening 
judgment of the apostle would frighten the disseminators 
of Paul's gospel, of which, unfortunately, the world is full 
today. 

The change of the persons must be taken into 
account here. For Paul speaks differently in the first 
curse than in the second. In the first, he says, "Even as 
we, or an angel from heaven, preach the gospel to you 
differently from what we have preached to you," 2c. In 
the second, he says, "differently from what you have 
received. And this he does on purpose, so that the 
Galatians would not say: We have not perverted the 
gospel which thou, Paul, didst preach unto us; but, when 
thou didst preach it unto us, we understood it not aright: 
but the teachers which came after thee have opened 
unto us the right understanding. This, he says, | will not 
allow in any way. Those shall not add to it nor improve it, 
but that which you have heard from me, that is the word 
of God; that alone shall remain. And | do not wish that | 
should be another teacher of the gospel, nor that you 
should be other disciples. Therefore, if you hear anyone 
who brings a different gospel from the one you have 
heard from me, or who boasts that he will bring 
something better than what you have received from me, 
let him be accursed with his disciples. 

(150) This is the way of the servants of Satan, that 
they know how to creep and ingratiate themselves into 
the hearts of men with this peculiar skill. They admit that 
those who taught the gospel before them had started 
well, but this was not enough; but they wanted to present 
certain things, which they wanted to teach in such a way 
that this would be of great benefit to the listeners.

should 2c. So today, too, the enthusiasts praise us for 
having begun the cause of the Gospel in the right way. 
But because we abhor and condemn their blasohemous 
doctrine, they call us flatterers and new papists, who are 
twofold worse than the old ones. By this art the thieves 
and robbers gain entrance into the sheepfold of the Lord, 
in order to steal, slaughter and destroy, namely, that they 
first confirm what is ours, then improve us, and explain 
more clearly, as they blasoheme, what we would not 
have understood sufficiently or not quite correctly. In the 
same way the false apostles prepared the entrance to 
the Galatians. Paul, they said) has indeed laid the 
foundation of Christian doctrine, but the right way of 
justification he does not hold, because he teaches 
apostasy from the law. Therefore receive from us what 
he was not able to teach rightly. But Paul does not want 
anything else to be taught by anyone, nor anything else 
to be heard and received by the Galatians than what he 
had taught them before, and what they had heard and 
received from him. But those, he says, who teach or 
accept anything else, they shall be accursed. 

151 The first two chapters contain almost nothing but 
denials and refutations. Only at the end of the second 
chapter does he begin to discuss the doctrine of 
justification. But this judgment of Paul is to remind us that 
all those are cursed who hold that the pope is a judge 
over Scripture, likewise that the church has power over 
Scripture, which the teachers of papal law and the 
writers of sentences have ungodly taught and have 
invoked for this reason: The Church has approved only 
four Evangelia, therefore there are only four; if she had 
approved more, there would be more. But since the 
church could accept and approve as many gospels as it 
wished, the church is above the gospel. 

This conclusion fits like a glove. 1) | approve of the 
Scripture, thus 


1) Adsoulo sa AQAulum. Cf. the note to Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. 
XX, 1640. 





| am higher than they. John the Baptist accedes to Christ 
(approbat) and confesses him, and points him with his 
finger, so he is more than Christ. The church approves 
the Christian doctrine and faith, so it is the higher one. 

To refute this ungodly and blasphemous doctrine of 
theirs, you have here a very clear text and a thunderbolt 
from heaven, that Paul, badly, himself, one, angels from 
heaven, the teachers on earth, and what other masters 
there may be, sums up everything and throws it under the 
holy scripture. This queen must rule, all must obey and 
be subject to her. Not their masters, judges or arbiters, 
but only witnesses, disciples and confessors, may it be 
the pope, or Luther, or Augustine, or Paul, or an angel 
from heaven, and no other doctrine shall be presented 
and heard in the church than the pure word of GOD, that 
is, the holy Scriptures; otherwise teachers and hearers 
shall be accursed with their doctrine. 


V. 10. Am I preaching to men now, or to 
God for His service? 


This is spoken with the same zeal as the previous, as 
if he wanted to say: Am I, Paul, who preached publicly in 
the churches, so unknown? Are not my exceedingly bitter 
struggles and so many disputes with the Jews in the 
daylight? From my sermons, from so many and so great 
tribulations, | think it is sufficiently evident whether | serve 
men or God. For all see that through this preaching of 
mine | have everywhere brought upon myself only 
persecution, the greatest and most terrifying hatred of my 
people and of all men. Thus | prove sufficiently that | do 
not seek the favor or applause of men with my sermon, 
but to make known the good deeds and the honor of God. 

We also (I can say this without glorification) do not 
seek the favor of men with our doctrine. For we teach that 
all men are by nature ungodly and children of wrath; we 
condemn free will, human ability, wisdom, justice, and all 
self-chosen worship; in short, 


88 Ari- Kai. 1, 92-94. Explanation of Galatians 1, 10. W. VIII, 1663-1666. 


89 





We say that there is absolutely nothing in us that is 
suitable to merit grace and forgiveness of sins, but we 
preach that the same is granted to us solely through the 
pure mercy of God for the sake of Christ. For this is how 
the heavens tell the glory of God and His works, so that 
they condemn all men altogether with their works. This 
is certainly not preaching to please men and the world. 

For the world cannot be enraged more fiercely and 
bitterly than when its wisdom, righteousness, worship 
and all that it is capable of are condemned. To condemn 
these best and highest gifts of the world is truly not to 
flatter the world, but rather to strive of one's own free will 
for hatred 1) and all misfortune (as they say), and to get 
one's hands full of it. For if we condemn men and all their 
best apparent endeavors, it cannot but come about that 
we immediately invite their bitterest hatred upon us, that 
they persecute us, banish us, condemn us and kill us. 

157 If then they see the other things, says Paul, why 
do they not also see this, that | teach divine things, not 
human things, that is, that | do not seek the favor of men 
with my teaching, but only glorify God's mercy, which 
was shown to us in Christ? For if | sought the favor of 
men, | would not condemn all their works. But just by 
condemning the works of men, that is, by pronouncing 
from the word of God (whose servant and apostle | am) 
the divine judgment against all men, that they are 
sinners, ungodly, unrighteous, children of wrath, 
captives of Satan and condemned, and that they are 
justified, not by works, not by circumcision, but by grace 
alone and through faith in Christ, | incur the 
irreconcilable hatred of all men. For they can hear 
nothing less than that they are such people, yes, they 
want them to be praised as wise, righteous, holy people 
2c. Therefore, this testifies sufficiently that | do not teach 
human things. 


1) Wittenberger: otium instead of oaium. 





In the same way Christ speaks Joh. 7, 7: "The world 
cannot hate you, but it hates me, because | testify of it 
that its works are evil", and Joh. 3, 19: "But this is the 
judgment, that light has come into the world, and men 
loved darkness rather than light, because their works 
were evil. 

But that | teach divine things, says the apostle, can 
already be sufficiently recognized from the fact that | 
preach only God's grace, mercy, good deeds and honor. 
Then he who speaks (as Christ says [John 13:13]) what 
his Lord and Master has commanded him, and glorifies 
not himself but Him whose apostle he is, brings and 
teaches the certain and divine word. But | teach only 
what is commanded me by GOD, glorifying not myself, 
but Him who sent me. Moreover, | incur the wrath and 
displeasure of Jews and Gentiles, therefore my teaching 
is true, pure, certain and divine, and there can be no 
other (much less a better) than this my teaching. 
Therefore, any other doctrine that does not teach, like 
mine, that all men are sinners and are justified by faith 
in Christ alone, must necessarily be false, uncertain, 
ungodly, blasphemous, accursed and diabolical. This 
judgment also applies to all who lead this doctrine and 
to those who accept it. 

(160) Thus we also declare with Paul in the most 
certain and certain way that any doctrine is accursed 
which does not agree with ours. For surely we too, with 
our preaching, do not seek the applause of men or the 
favor of princes, bishops, etc., but only God's favor, 
whose grace and mercy we also preach alone, and 
trample underfoot and condemn everything that is ours. 
Therefore we confidently say that he who teaches 
another gospel, or one contrary to ours, is sent by the 
devil and accursed. 


Or do I intend to please people? 


That is, do | serve people, or do | serve God? He 
always takes sides with the false apostles. These, he 
says, seek to please men and flatter them. For 


90 Dri- 1, 94-97. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1666-1670. 


91 





In this way they seek to gain glory for themselves in their 
carnal nature. Furthermore, because they do not want 
to suffer the hatred and persecution of men, they teach 
circumcision so that they do not have to suffer 
persecution for the sake of the cross of Christ, as it says 
later in Cap. 5:11. 

You can find many people today who strive to please 
men, and in order to live their lives in peace and security 
of the flesh, they preach to men for service, that is, they 
teach ungodly things, or at least, against their 
conscience, they approve of the blasphemies of the 
adversaries and their ungodly judgment against the 
word of God, in order to keep the favor of princes and 
bishops and not lose theirs. But we, because we strive 
to be pleasing to God and not to men, invite devilish and 
infernal hatred upon ourselves and suffer disgrace and 
abuse from the world, death and all evil. 

Thus Paul says here: | do not intend to please men, 
| do not desire that they should praise my doctrine and 
exalt me as the best teacher, but only that God alone 
may please my doctrine, and thereby | make enemies of 
men who are indignant about it; and this | experience. 
For they give me as a reward shame, blasphemy, 
imprisonment, sword 2c. On the other hand, the false 
apostles teach human things, that is, things that are 
pleasing to reason and easy for it to accept, so that they 
may have peace and win the favor and approval of the 
people. And what they strive for, they also attain. For 
they are praised and highly exalted by all. So Christ also 
says Matth. 6, 2. that the hypocrites do everything "so 
that they will be praised by the people", and Joh. 5, 44. 
he severely punishes such people and says: "How can 
you believe, you who take honor from one another? And 
the honor that is from God alone you do not seek." 

What Paul has said up to this point are almost only 
examples. But he insists everywhere that his teaching is 
true and the right teaching. Therefore he admonishes 
the Galatians that they should not despise his teaching 
and accept no other. 


If | were still pleasing men, | would not be Christ's 
servant. 

All this must be related to the whole ministry and 
service of Paul, so that it forms a kind of contrast to his 
former walk in Judaism, as if he wanted to say: Do you 
think that | still seek to please men as | did before? So 
also in the fifth chapter, v. 11: "If I still preach 
circumcision, why do | still suffer persecution?" as if he 
wanted to say: "Do you not see and hear my daily hard 
struggles, the greatest persecutions and tribulations? 
Since | was converted and called to the apostleship, | 
have never spoken to please men, | have never sought to 
please them, but only God, that is, | do not seek the honor 
and favor of men with my ministry and with my teaching, 
but God. 

This is what Paul says to show how deceitfully and 
deceitfully the false apostles tried to make him hated by 
the Galatians. They picked contradictions out of his 
sermons and writings (as today the adversaries pick 
contradictions out of our books), and wanted to convict 
him that he had taught contradictory things, and therefore 
said that Paul should not be believed, but that 
circumcision and the law should be kept. For he himself 
had confirmed this with his own example, since he had 
circumcised Timothy according to the law [Acts 16:3], had 
himself cleansed with four men in the temple at 
Jerusalem [Acts 21:26], had his head shaved in Keuchrea 
[Acts 18:18] 2c. The slanderers claimed that Paul had 
done this because of necessity, forced by the command 
and the reputation of the apostles 2c., while he had taken 
it upon himself to serve the weak of his own free will, so 
that no offense would be given to those who did not yet 
recognize Christian freedom. To their calumnies he 
answers thus: How true it is what the false apostles invent 
against me, in order to disturb my gospel and again to 
establish the law and the circumcision, the thing itself 
sufficiently shows. For if | preached the law and 
circumcision, and the ability and the .

W. VIII, 1670-1673. 93 





If | praised the nobility of men, | would not be hated by 
men, but would please them. 


V. 11. 12. But | make known to you, brethren, that the 
gospel which is preached by me is not human. For | 
neither received it nor learned it from any man, but by 
the revelation of Jesus Christ. 

This is the main proposition (propositio == the 
subject) of the present passage, from which the 
refutation and defense follows to the end of the second 
chapter, and it is a kind of continuous story that Paul 
tells here. Jerome writhes anxiously and takes great 


pains to rhyme it together (concordanda), but he does 
not touch the matter itself, because he does not 
consider what Paul wants or what he has in mind. 

But the histories in Scripture are often briefly 
summarized and interwoven, so that they cannot easily 
be rhymed with one another, as is the case with Peter's 
denials and the history of the passion of Christ 2c. So 
Paul does not tell the whole story here. | do not bother 
with it, nor do | care much about rhyming it together, but 
only look at what Paul's intention is and what he is 
aiming at. 

But this is the main proposition of the present 
passage: My gospel is not human, neither did | receive 
it from any man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
He insists on this main sentence, dwells on it for a long 
time and confirms it with an oath that he did not learn his 
gospel from any man, but received it through the 
revelation of Jesus Christ. And he swears out of 
necessity, so that the Galatians will believe this, not to 
give ear to the false apostles, whom he punishes as 
liars, because they had said that Paul had learned and 
received his gospel from the apostles. 

170 But that he says his gospel is not human, this is 
not to say that his gospel is not of human origin, because 
this is self-evident, for the false apostles also boasted of 
it. 





that their teaching does not originate from men, but from 
God; but he wants this to be understood in such a way 
that he did not learn the gospel through the ministry of 
any man, nor did he receive it through any human 
mediation (as we all either learn it through the ministry 
of men or receive it through some other human 
mediation, some by hearing, others by reading, writing, 
painting 2c.), but that he received it precisely through the 
revelation of Jesus Christ. Whoever wants to make a 
different decision here, may do so for all | care. - The 
apostle here casually shows that Christ is not only a 
man, but at the same time true God and man, since he 
says that he did not receive his gospel through a man. 

Now Paul received his gospel on the way to 
Damascus, where Christ appeared to him and spoke 
with him. He also talked with him later in the temple at 
Jerusalem (Apost. 22, 18.], but on the way he received 
the gospel, as Lucas tells the story in Acts, Cap. 9, 3. ff. 
"Arise," says Christ to him, "and go into the city; there 
shall they tell thee what thou shalt do" [v. 6.]. He does 
not command him to go into the city, that he might learn 
the gospel of Ananias, but Ananias was to baptize him, 
lay hands on him, command him the ministry of the 
word, and commend him to the church; but not to teach 
the gospel, which, as he here boasts, he had already 
received before in the way by the revelation of JEsu 
Christ alone. And Ananias himself confesses this in 
these words [Cap. 9, 17.], "Dear brother Saul," 1) he 
says, "the LORD hath sent me (who appeared unto thee 
by the way), that thou mightest recover thy sight," 2c. 
Therefore he did not receive his teaching from Ananias, 
but since he was already called, enlightened and 
instructed by Christ on the way, he was sent to Ananias, 
so that he would also have the testimony of men that he 
was called by God to preach the gospel of Christ.

Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1673-1676 . 


95 





Paul is forced to tell this in order to prove the 
slanders of the false apostles null and void, who tried to 
make him extremely hated by the Galatians, namely in 
this way [that they said] that Paul was far inferior to the 
other disciples of the apostles, who had received what 
they taught and held from the apostles, whose conduct 
they had also seen for a long time. Paul also received 
exactly the same from them (the apostles), although he 
denies it. Why then would they rather follow a lesser 
man and despise the reputation of the apostles 


themselves, who were the superiors (majores) and 
teachers not only of the Galatians, but also of all the 
churches in the whole world? This was indeed a great 
and solid proof, based on the prestige of the apostles, 
which the false apostles used; thus the Galatians were 
turned away quickly, especially in this matter. | could 
never have believed it if | did not see it in these examples 
of the churches in Galatia, Corinth and Asia 2c. that also 
these people, who in the beginning received the word 
with joy (among whom there were many excellent 
people), could be turned away so suddenly. 

Dear God, how easily a terrible and immeasurable 
damage is done by a single [apparent] reason, which, 
when the Lord withdraws His hand of mercy, so strikes 
down the conscience that one can lose everything in an 
instant. Therefore, the false apostles easily deceived the 
Galatians by this pretense, who were not yet established 
and did not have deep roots, but were still weak in faith. 

The matter of justification is also one that is difficult 
to hold on to, not in itself, for in itself it is extremely firm 
and certain, but as far as we are concerned; | often 
experience this myself. For | know how | sometimes 
have to struggle in hours of darkness. | know how often 
| suddenly lose the roots of the gospel and of grace, as 
it were, in some dense clouds. | also know how even 
those who are well trained and stand firm walk on 
slippery ground. 





(175) We have the right knowledge of this matter, for 
we can teach it, and this is a certain sign that we have 
it. For no one can teach others what he does not know 
himself. The poet says: It is seen that you know it, for 


you can teach others (Signum scientis est, inquit ille, 


posse docere). But since in the present struggle we are 
to avail ourselves of the gospel, which is a word of 
grace, comfort, and life, the law, which is a word of 
wrath, sorrow, and death, precedes the gospel and 
begins to stir up unrest, setting up terror in the 
conscience no less than that which that awful and 


terrifying appearance (species) produced on Mount 
Sinai (Ex. 19:16), just as a single threatening sentence 
from Scripture overwhelms and_ darkens _ all 
consolations, and so completely shatters everything that 
is in us [our heart and conscience] that we completely 
forget the cause of justification, grace, Christ and the 
Gospel. Therefore, this thing, as much as is in us, is on 
very slippery ground, because we are slippery. 

Furthermore, we ourselves are half our adversaries, 
namely our own reason and the powers of reason stand 
against us. In addition, the flesh resists the spirit, which 
cannot hold on to the certainty that God's promises are 
true. Therefore, it argues and fights against the spirit 
and, as Paul says, takes the spirit captive so that it 
cannot believe as firmly as it would like to. That is why 
we constantly inculcate that the knowledge of Christ and 
faith is not a human thing or work, but is par excellence 
a gift of God, who both creates and sustains faith in us. 

177. But just as God first gives faith through the word, 
so He also practices, increases, strengthens and 
completes it through the word. Therefore, the highest 
service of God and the most holy Sabbath is to practice 
godliness, to handle the word and to hear it. On the other 
hand, there is nothing more dangerous than 
overindulgence in the word of God. Therefore, anyone 
who is so cold that he thinks he has grasped it and 
gradually begins to grow weary of the word, has not 
grasped Christ and the Word. 


96 Lri. Cai. 1, 101-103. Explanation of Galatians 1, 11. 12. W. VL11, 1676-1679. 


He has already lost the gospel, and grasps what he 


thinks he knows only speculatively, and is like a man, 
as Jacobus says, who looks at his face in the mirror, but 
from that moment on walks away and forgets how he 
was formed [Jac. 1, 23. 24.]. And such people eventually 


become gushers and fluttering spirits (Nugaces 


spiritus). 

For this reason, every godly person should strive and 
struggle with all his might to learn this doctrine in a very 
real way and to keep it well, and for this purpose call 
upon God in humble prayer and study and reflect on it 
in God's Word without ceasing. And even if we have 
exerted ourselves to the utmost, it will still take enough 
effort, for we have not contemptible, but very great, 
exceedingly strong and quite tireless enemies against 
us, namely our flesh, all the dangers of the world, 
likewise the law, sin, death, wrath and judgment of God, 
and also the devil himself, who never ceases to tempt 
us, inwardly by his fiery darts, outwardly by false 
apostles, so that he may bring down, if not all, at least a 
great number of us. 

Therefore, this argument of the false apostles had a 
beautiful appearance and great power. The same 
reason moves many people today, namely: The 
apostles, the holy fathers and their successors have 
taught so; so the church holds and believes. But it is 
impossible that Christ should let his church err for so 
many centuries. You alone are certainly not wiser than 
so many holy people and the whole church 2c. In this 
way the devil disguises himself as if he were an angel of 
light and attacks us cunningly today through some 
poisonous hypocrites who say: "We do not care about 
the pope and the bishops who despise and persecute 
God's word to the highest degree; we also abhor the 
hypocrisy and deceit of the monks 2c.; but we desire that 
the reputation of the holy Catholic Church remain 
unharmed. It has held and taught this way for so many 
centuries, and so have all the teachers of the first 
church, exceedingly holy people, much greater and 
more learned than you. Who are you 





97 


How can you dare to deviate from all of these and impose 
a different doctrine on us? 

180. When Satan does this sharply and uses the flesh 
and reason, the conscience is frightened and despairs if 
you do not constantly come to your senses and say: 
"Even if St. Cyprian, Ambrose and Augustine, or St. 
Peter, Paul and John, or even an angel from heaven 
teach differently, | know this for certain, that | do not 
preach human but divine things, that is, that | ascribe 
everything to God and nothing to men. 

| remember that when my cause came up, D. 
Staupitz, who was then a very respected man and vicar 
of the Augustinian Order, said to me: "I like the fact that 
this doctrine, which you preach, ascribes honor and 
everything to God alone, but nothing to man. But GOtte 
(that is clearer than the sun) cannot be ascribed too 
much honor, goodness 2c. This word comforted and 
fortified me very much at that time. And it is true that the 
doctrine of the Gospel takes from men all honor, wisdom, 
righteousness 2c., and attributes this only to the Creator, 
who makes everything out of nothing. But it is much safer 
to ascribe too much to God than to man. For then we can 
confidently say: Even if the church, Augustine and other 
teachers, likewise Peter, Apollo, yes, even an angel from 
heaven teach otherwise, my teaching is such that it alone 
proclaims and preaches God's grace and glory, and 
condemns the wisdom and righteousness of all men (as 
far as blessedness is concerned). In this | cannot sin, 
because | ascribe to God and men, to each one, what 
actually and in truth belongs to them. 

But you say: The church is holy, the fathers are holy. 
That is right. But even if the Church is holy, it must pray, 
"Forgive us our trespasses." So even the fathers, holy as 
they were, were blessed only through the forgiveness of 
sins. Therefore, if we teach anything contrary to the word 
of God, neither I, nor the church, nor the fathers, nor the 
apostles, nor even an angel from heaven, should be 
believed, but the word of the Lord should remain.

99 





in eternity. Otherwise, this reason of the false apostles 
would have been of exceedingly great probative force 
against the teaching of Paul, for it was, | say, truly a 
great, great thing that they should hold the whole church 
with the whole company of the apostles against the 
Galatians against the one Paul, who, moreover, had 
come later and had a lesser reputation. It was therefore 
a very solid reason and extremely conclusive. For no 
one likes to say that the church is wrong, and yet one 
must of necessity say that it is wrong when it teaches 
something without or even against the word of God. 

Peter, the highest among the apostles, did not live 
and teach according to God's word, so he erred. And 
Paul did not cover up this error (although it was 
apparently only a small error), because he saw that this 
would bring ruin to the whole church, but resisted him 
under his eyes and punished him for not walking 
according to the truth of the gospel, as follows in the 
second chapter [v. 11 ff]. Therefore, neither the church, 
nor the fathers, 1) nor the apostles, nor even the angels 
must be heard, unless they bring and teach the pure 
word of God. 

The same reason is extremely burdensome to our 
cause today. For if we are to believe neither the Pope, 
nor the Fathers, nor Luther, if they do not teach the pure 
Word of God, then whom are we to believe? Meanwhile, 
who can make consciences sure which of the two, we or 
our adversaries, teach the pure Word of God? For they 
also boast that they have and teach the pure Word of 
God. We do not believe the papists, because they do not 
teach the Word of God, nor can they teach it, and on the 
other hand they hate us most bitterly and persecute us 
as the most harmful heretics and seducers. What should 
we do here? Shall we allow any swarming spirit to teach 
whatever it wants, since the world neither wants to hear 
our teaching nor can stand it? For as much as we boast 
with Paul that we teach the pure gospel of Christ (to 
which not only the emperor, the pope, and the whole 
world should yield, but should also accept it with open 
arms and 


1) Wittenberger: kstrus, instead of katrss in the Jena. 





But if someone teaches something else, be it the pope, 
or St. Augustine, or an apostle, or an angel from heaven, 
let him be accursed with his gospel), then we do not 
judge anything, but must hear that our boasting is not 
only proud, presumptuous, and completely null and void, 
but also blasphemous and devilish. But if we humble 
ourselves and give way to the raging of the adversaries, 
then both the papists and the enthusiasts become 
arrogant. The latter want to bring and teach something 
new that the world has not heard before, but the latter 
want to reestablish and confirm their old abominations. 
Therefore, let each one see to it that he is sure of a fine 
profession and a fine doctrine, so that he may dare to 
say with Paul in the most sure and certain way [v. 8]: "So 
do we, or an angel from heaven" 2c. 

So much for the main sentence of this passage, 
which is: | did not receive my gospel from men, but 
through the revelation of Jesus Christ. He now proves 
this in detail by many stories and facts. 


V.13. 14. For you have heard my conduct in Judaism, 
how | persecuted and disturbed the congregation of God 
beyond measure. And increased in Judaism above 
many of my kindred in my generation. 


This passage does not contain any particular 
teaching, but Paul gives himself as an example by 
saying: "| have defended Phariseeism and Judaism 
more strongly and consistently than you and your false 
teachers. Therefore, if the righteousness of the law were 
something, | would not have fallen away from it either, 
since before | recognized Christ, | labored so hard to 
accomplish it, and in this | also achieved so much that | 
surpassed many of my peers in my generation. Then, in 
order to defend it, | was so zealous that | also persecuted 
the congregation of God most fiercely and disturbed 
them. For when | received power from the chief priests, 
| imprisoned many of the saints.

W. VIII, 1683-1686. 101 





| threw them to the ground and pronounced judgment 
when they were killed. And through all the synagogues | 
often tormented them, and compelled them to 
blaspheme, and was exceedingly senseless against 
them, persecuting them even unto foreign cities. [Acts 
26:10, 11.] 


And zealous beyond measure for the paternal law. 


187 As Jerome rightly reminds us, Paul does not call 
the Pharisaic or human statutes the paternal law, 
because here he is not dealing with Pharisaic statutes, 
but with a much more important matter. So he calls the 
holy law of Moses itself the paternal law, that is, which 
had been received and inherited from the fathers. For 
this, he says, | have labored beyond measure in 
Judaism. In the same way he speaks in the letter to the 
Philippians, Cap. 3, 5. 6. "According to the law," he says, 
"| have been a Pharisee, according to zeal a persecutor 
of the congregation of God, according to righteousness 
in the law blameless," as if to say: | could publicly boast 
and defy the whole Jewish people, even the best and 
holiest of the circumcision, so that they would only expel 
one from all of them who had fought for the law of Moses 
with greater zeal or more vehemently than | had done in 
the past. | was, however, before others a special zealot 
for the paternal law, that is, | strove to the utmost to attain 
righteousness from the law. This should move you, 
Galatians, not to believe those deceivers who exalt the 
righteousness of the law as a thing of the highest 
importance, since, if it were a matter of boasting, | could 
boast with more truth of this very righteousness of the 
law in an outstanding way. 

If anyone, | have certainly, before the light of the 
Gospel went out, held with reverence the papist laws and 
the paternal statutes (pie sensi) and struggled for them, 
and with great earnestness insisted on and defended 
them as sacred, and on their observance as necessary 
for salvation. Then | myself tried with all diligence to keep 
them, by toiling the body with more fasting, vigils, prayers 
and other exercises. 


than all those who hate and persecute me so bitterly 
today, because | now take the honor from these works 
that they could make righteous. For in their observance | 
have been so careful and superstitious that | have 
imposed a greater burden on my body than it could have 
borne without danger to health. | have held the pope in 
honor without all self-interest (pure) and have not sought 
sinecures and high positions of honor 2c., but, whatever 
| have done, | have done it all out of a simple heart, out 
of pious zeal and for the honor of God 2c. "But that which 
was profitable to me | count," now with Paul [Phil. 3:7, 8], 
"detrimental to the abundant knowledge of Christ my 
Lord." But the adversaries, because they are idle people 
and have not endured any trials, do not believe that | and 
very many others have experienced and suffered such 
things, who have made it exceedingly hard for us to 
attain peace of heart, which, however, could not possibly 
be found in such great darkness. 


V.15-17. But when it pleased God, who separated 
me from my mother's womb, and called me by his 
grace, to manifest his Son in me, that I should preach 
him by the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I 
departed, and conferred not with flesh and blood; 
neither came I to Jerusalem to them that were 
apostles before me, but went into Arabia, and 
returned to Damascus. 


This is the first journey of Paul. Jerome gets angry 
here and says that Lucas does not write about Paul's 
journey to Arabia in the Acts of the Apostles, as if it were 
necessary to describe the deeds and works for each 
individual day, which is impossible. This should be 
enough for us, that we have individual parts and a short 
epitome of the histories, from which we can draw 
examples and lessons. 

190: Paul testifies here that immediately after he was 
called by the grace of God to preach Christ among the 
Gentiles, he went to Arabia without consulting anyone, 
and set about the work to which he had been called.

103 





had been. And this passage testifies from whom he 
received his teaching, and by what means he came to 
the knowledge of the Gospel and to the apostleship. 
"Since it pleased God," he says, as if to say: | did not 
earn my merit by striving with ignorance for the law of 
God; indeed, this foolish and ungodly zeal blinded me, 
so that out of God's approval | fell into a terrible rage and 
committed the most wicked crimes. | persecuted the 
church of God, | was an enemy of Christ and 
blasphemed His gospel, yes, | caused others to shed 
much innocent blood; that was my merit. In the midst of 
this rage, | was called to this great grace. Is it because 
of this raging? Not at all. But the abundant grace of God, 
who called me and had mercy on me, forgave me and 
forgave me these blasphemies, and for these terrible 
sins of mine, which | then considered to be the highest 
righteousness and a service of God that pleased God 
exceedingly, he gave me his grace and knowledge of the 
truth and called me to the apostleship. 

Today we come to the knowledge of grace through 
the same merits. When | was a monk, | crucified Christ 
daily, and through my false confidence, which was 
constantly with me at that time, | blasphemed Him. 
Outwardly | was not like other people, robbers, 
unrighteous, adulterers, but kept chastity, obedience 
and poverty, yes, since | was free from care for this 
present life, | gave myself entirely to fasting, vigil, prayer, 
Mass reading 2c. However, under this [outward] holiness 
and trust in my own righteousness, | continued to nurture 
distrust, doubt, fear, hatred and blasphemy against God, 
and such my righteousness was nothing but a puddle of 
dung, and a kingdom in which the devil took pleasure. 
For Satan loves such saints and has his greatest delight 
in them, since they corrupt their own bodies and souls 
and deprive themselves of all blessings and gifts of God 
and rob themselves of them. In such people, however, 
there is the greatest godlessness, blindness, doubt, 
contempt for God, ignorance of the gospel, desecration 
of the sacra 





They blaspheme Christ and trample Him underfoot and 
abuse all the goods of God. In short, such saints are 
Satan's captive servants, therefore they must think, 
speak and do what he wants, no matter how much they 
seem to outwardly surpass others in good works, 
severity and holiness of life. 

192 We were such people under the papacy, truly as 
great (if not greater) abusers and blasphemers against 
Christ and his gospel than Paul himself, and especially 
|. | thought it was a crime worthy of eternal 
condemnation if anyone deviated from him in the 
slightest. The pope was held in such high esteem by me 
that | thought it was a crime worthy of eternal damnation 
if anyone deviated from him in the slightest, and this 
ungodly opinion led me to believe that John Hus was 
such a cursed heretic that it would be nefarious even to 
denounce him, that it would be nefarious to even think 
of him, and | myself, in order to defend the reputation of 
the pope, would have brought sword and fire to burn this 
heretic, and would have thought that | was doing God a 
very great favor by doing so. 

Therefore, tax collectors and harlots are not even to 
be considered evil compared to such hypocritical saints. 
For those have remorse when they sin, and do not seek 
to justify their ungodly deeds, but these do not recognize 
their abominations, idolatries and ungodly way of life 
(cultus) as sin, so much so that they even preach that 
this is righteousness and a sacrifice quite pleasing to 
God, and worship it as the greatest holiness, promising 
other people blessedness through such things and 
selling them to them for money as wholesome things. 

194 This is now our great righteousness, this is our 
immense merit, by which we come to the knowledge of 
grace, namely, that we have persecuted, blasphemed, 
trampled underfoot and condemned God, Christ, the 
gospel, the faith, the sacraments, all true Christians 
(pios), the true worship of God so hostilely and 
devilishly, and have thoroughly taught and established 
the adversary. And the more holy we were, the more 


blind we were, and the louder (purius) we worshipped 


the devil. Every one of us was a bloodhound, if not in 
deed, yet in heart.

But since it pleased God. 


As if he wanted to say: "It is God's great and 
immeasurable grace that He not only spares me, such 
a wicked man, a blasphemer, persecutor and robber of 
God, but also gives me the knowledge of salvation, the 
Spirit, Christ His Son, the apostleship and eternal life. 

Likewise, God has graciously regarded us, who are 
burdened with such sins, and has not only forgiven our 
ungodliness and blasphemies out of pure mercy for the 
sake of Christ, but has also showered us with the 
greatest benefits and spiritual gifts. But many of us are 
not only ungrateful to God for this unspeakable grace, 
and forget, as it says in 2 Petr. 1, 9, the cleansing of our 
former sins and the grace given, but open the door 
again to the devil and begin to grow weary of the word; 
very many also falsify it and cause new errors. With 
these, the last becomes worse than the first. 


Who has separated me from my 
mother's womb. 


This is a Hebrew way of speaking; that is, He 
sanctified me, He ordained me, He prepared me; that is, 
while | was still in my mother's womb, God had 
foreknown that it would happen that | would rage against 
the church with such great fury, and that afterwards, out 
of pure grace, He would bring me out of the course of 
my cruelty and blasphemy, according to His mercy, 
back into the way of truth and blessedness. In short, 
before | was born, | was an apostle in the eyes of God, 
and when the time came, | was also declared an apostle 
before the world. 

Thus Paul completely cuts off all merit, and ascribes 
glory to God alone, but only shame to himself, as if to 
say: All the gifts, the smallest and the greatest, spiritual 
and bodily, which God wanted to give me, and all the 
good that | would ever do in my whole life, God Himself 
had already provided before, when | was still in my 
mother's womb, since | had neither done anything good 
nor done anything bad. 





| could neither think, nor wish, nor do, but was an 
unformed fruit. Therefore, this gift happened to me only 
by the grace of God, who provided for me beforehand 
and had mercy on me even before | was born. After that, 
when | was born, he carried me, even though | was 
burdened with innumerable abominations of wickedness 
and sin; and in order that he might make known the more 
the unspeakable and immeasurable greatness of his 
mercy toward me, he remitted my exceedingly great and 
innumerable sins out of sheer grace. After that he also 
showered me with such a great abundance of grace that 
| not only recognized for myself what was given to us in 
Christ, but | should also preach this to others. 

The merits of all people are of the same kind, 
especially the old fools who have toiled in the muck of 
human justice before others. 


And called by his grace. 

See how carefully the apostle chooses his expression 
(diligentiam). "He has called me," he says. How? 
Because of my Pharisaism, because of my blameless 
and holy life, because of my prayers, fasting and works? 
No, but much less because of my _ blasphemies, 
persecutions and acts of violence. How then? Out of 
pure grace. 


V. 16: That he manifested his Son in me. 


Here you hear what teaching is given and 
commanded to Paul, namely the teaching of the Gospel, 
which is a revelation of the Son of God. This teaching is 
different from the law, which does not reveal the Son of 
God, but indicates sin, terrifies the conscience, reveals 
death, the wrath and judgment of God, and hell. All this 
is not the Son of GOd. So the gospel is such a doctrine, 
which does not admit any law. Oh, who could make a 
good distinction here, so that he would not look for a law 
in the Gospel, but would separate the two as far from 
each other as heaven is from earth! This difference is in 
itself easy, certain and clear, but for us difficult, yes, 
almost incomprehensible. You may easily say that 


106 Dri 6ai-1> II3-11S. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1692-1696. 


The gospel is nothing other than the revelation of the 
Son of God, than the knowledge of Jesus Christ, it is not 
the revelation or knowledge of the law, but to hold this 
immovably in the distress of the conscience, and when 
one has to put it into practice, is difficult even for the 
most experienced. 

If the gospel is the revelation of the Son of God, as 
Paul describes it here, then it certainly does not accuse 
and terrify the conscience, does not threaten death and 
does not lead to despair, as the law does, but it is the 
teaching of Christ, who is certainly neither a law nor a 
work, but our righteousness, wisdom, sanctification and 
redemption, 1 Cor. 1:30. 1, 30. Although this is brighter 
than the sun at noon, the nonsense and blindness of the 
papists has been so great that they have made a law of 
love out of the gospel and a lawgiver out of Christ, who 
gave more severe commandments than Moses himself. 

The gospel teaches that Christ did not come to give 
a new law or to teach us how to walk in righteousness 


(de moribus), but that he came to be the sacrifice for 
the sins of the whole world, to forgive us our sins, and to 
give us eternal life because of him, not because of the 
works of the law or our righteousness. Of this abundant 
treasure, which is given to us freely, the gospel actually 
preaches. Therefore, it is a doctrine that cannot be 
learned or attained by any effort, diligence or wisdom of 
men, nor even by the divine law, but by God Himself. As 
Paul says here: "It is revealed"; first through the outward 
word, then inwardly through the Holy Spirit. 

The gospel is therefore the word of God, which came 
down from heaven and is revealed by the Holy Spirit, 
who was also sent for this purpose, but in such a way 
that the outward word precedes it. For even Paul himself 
did not have an inward revelation until he had first heard 
the outward word from heaven, namely this [Acts 9:4], 
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" 2c. So first he 
heard the outward 


107 


Only then did the revelations follow, the knowledge of 
the Word, faith and the gifts of the Spirit. 


That I should preach him through the 
gospel among the Gentiles. 

205. Paul arranges his words in a suitable way: "It 
pleased God well," he says, "to reveal His Son in me." 
For what purpose ? Not only so that | myself should 
believe in the Son of God, but also make Him known 
among the Gentiles. Why not among the Jews? And 
here you see that Paul is actually the apostle of the 
Gentiles, although he also preached Christ among the 
Jews. 

Here Paul, as he often does, sums up his theology in 
the shortest possible way, but it is this: Preach Christ 
among the Gentiles; as if he wanted to say: | do not want 
to burden the Gentiles with the law, because | am the 


apostle and the gospel preacher (€Van- gelista) of the 
Gentiles, not their lawgiver. Thus he directs all words 
against the false apostles, as if to say: You have not 
heard, dear Galatians, that | taught the righteousness of 
the law or of works, for that belongs to Mosi, not to me, 
Paulo, the apostle of the Gentiles. For | have the ministry 


and service of the gospel to you (ad VOS), that | may 
preach to you the same revelation which | have. 
Therefore you do not need to hear a teacher who 
teaches the law, because among the Gentiles not the 
law but the gospel is to be preached, not Moses but the 
Son of God, not the righteousness of works but of faith. 
This is the real preaching that concerns the Gentiles. 


Immediately I went to, and did not 
discuss it with flesh and blood. 


In this passage Jerome harshly attacks Porphyrius 
and Julianus, who accuse Paul of being presumptuous, 
because he did not want to discuss his gospel with the 
other apostles; likewise, that Paul called the apostles 
flesh and blood. 

208 But to say it briefly, Paul is not talking about the 
apostles here, since he mentions "flesh and blood", 
because he immediately adds: "Neither came to 
Jerusalem to those who were 


108 


But what he means is that after he received the 
revelation of the gospel from Christ, he did not consult 
with anyone in Damascus, much less ask anyone to 
teach him the gospel, that he did not go to Jerusalem to 
Peter and the other apostles to learn the gospel from 
them, but that he immediately preached in Damascus, 
where he had received baptism from Ananias, and the 
latter had laid his hands on him (for he had to have an 
outward sign and testimony of his calling), that Jesus 
was the Son of God. The same is written by Lucas, 
Apost. 9, 20. 


V.17. Neither came he to Jerusalem unto them 
that were apostles before me, but went into Arabia, 
and returned to Damascus. 


That is, since | had neither seen nor consulted the 
apostles, | went to Arabia and immediately began to 
carry out my ministry of preaching the gospel among the 
Gentiles, to which | had been called and for which | had 
received divine revelation. In vain, therefore, does 
Jerome ask what Paul did in Arabia? For what else could 
he do but preach Christ? For this, he says, the Son of 
God was revealed to him, that he should preach him 
among the Gentiles. Therefore, he immediately went 
from Damascus, a pagan city, to Arabia, where there 
were also pagans, and there he carried out his ministry 
bravely, but did not first learn the gospel from any man 
or from the apostles, but was content with the heavenly 
calling and revelation of Christ alone. 

Therefore, this whole passage is a kind of refutation 
of the reason that the false apostles used against Paul. 
For they said that he was a disciple and listener of the 
apostles, who lived according to the law; then that Paul 
himself also lived according to the law; therefore it was 
necessary that the Gentiles also kept the law and were 
circumcised. To shut these slanderers up, he tells this 
long story. Before my conversion, 


1) Wittenberger: eontutsrim, instead of: eontulsrit. 


64-1-114-117. Explanation of Galatians 1, 16-20. W. vin, isW-isgg. 109 


he says, | did not learn my gospel from the apostles or 
other believing brethren, for | persecuted and disturbed 
not only this doctrine, but also the church of God to the 
utmost; but not even after my conversion, because 
immediately at Damascus | preached, not Moses with 
fine law, but Christ, without consulting anyone or seeing 
the apostles. 

We can also boast that we did not receive our 
teaching from the pope. We have received from him the 


Holy Scriptures and the outward creeds (symbola), but 
not the doctrine which has come to us only through 
God's gift. After that our studying, reading and 
researching has come to it. So this is not something that 
our adversaries want to claim today: Who would believe 
your teaching, you Lutherans, since you are not in public 
office? You must receive the teaching from the pope, 
from the bishops, who are ordained for this and are in 
the rightful office 2c. 


V. 19, 20: After three years I came to Jerusalem to 
see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. But I saw 
none of the other apostles, except Jacobum, the 
brother of the Lord. 


Paul confesses that he was with the apostles, but not 
with all of them. However, he indicates that he went to 
them in Jerusalem, not by command, but voluntarily. 
Further, not to learn anything from them, but only to see 
Peter. Lucas writes the same in the Acts of the Apostles, 
Cap. 9, 27, that Barnabas led Paul to the apostles and 
told them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how 
he had talked with him and how he had preached the 
name of Jesus freely in Damascus. Barnabas gave him 
this testimony. 

All his words are directed to deny the claim that he 
received his gospel from a man. He admits that he saw 
Peter and Jacob, the brother of the Lord, but no one else 
except these two, but he did not learn anything from 
them either 2c. So he admits that he was at Jerusalem 
with the apostles, and the false apostles were right in 
saying this. He further admits. 


110 Dri. 1, 117-120. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1699-1702. 111 





that he had lived according to the Jewish way, but he 
had only done so with the Jews. For Paul followed the 
rule: "If you live in Rome, keep to Roman customs. He 
also testifies to this in his first letter to the Corinthians, 
Cap. 9, 19-22: "Although | am free from everyone," he 
says, "| have made myself a servant to everyone, so that 
| may win many of them. To the Jews | have become as 
a Jew 2c. | have become all things to all men, that | might 
save some everywhere." So he admits that he was with 
the apostles at Jerusalem, but he denies that he learned 
his gospel from them, likewise he denies that he was 
forced to teach the gospel as the apostles had 
prescribed. So the emphasis is on the word "see". He 
says: | went up [to Jerusalem to see Peter, not to learn 
from him. Therefore neither Peter nor Jacobus became 
my teacher. But he absolutely denies that he has seen 
others. 

But why does Paul do this in so many words that he 
almost exaggerates that he did not receive his gospel 
from a man, nor did he even learn it from the apostles? 
He wants to make the churches of Galatia, which have 
already been destroyed by the false apostles, certain 
that his gospel is the word of God. That is why he insists 
so strongly on it. And if he had not proved this most 
firmly, he would not have been able to destroy the false 
apostles, because they would have opposed him: We 
are as good as Paul, for we are disciples of the apostles 
as well as he; then he is only one person and stands 
alone, but ours are many. We therefore have the 
advantage over him in reputation and number. So Paul 
was forced to boast, to claim and swear that he had not 
learned the gospel from any man, nor had he himself 
received it from the apostles; and it was the highest 
necessity to boast in such a way, not vain boasting, as 
Porphyrius and Julianus blaspheme, who no more 
recognized than Jerome what Paul was up to here. 

215 Here Paul's ministry was in danger, and all the 
churches were in danger. 





The need of the ministry and of all the churches required 
Paul to boast of his profession with a necessary and holy 
pride. Therefore, the need of the ministry and all the 
churches required Paul to boast with a necessary and 
holy pride about his profession and the revelation of the 
gospel that he had received from Christ, so that the 
consciences would be assured that Paul's teaching was 
the word of God. This was a great and serious matter, 
namely, that all the churches should be preserved in 
sound doctrine; in short, it was a matter of eternal life 
and eternal death. For when the right pure and certain 
word is taken away, there is no more comfort, no more 
blessedness, no more life 2c. Therefore, he tells this 
story with the intention of keeping the churches in the 
right doctrine, but does not argue about defending his 
honor, as Porphyrius blasohemes. He wanted to prove 
with this story that he had not received his gospel from 
any man, and that he had preached the same gospel in 
Damascus and Arabia from divine revelation for several 
years, three or four. He preached the same gospel as 
the apostles before he had seen any of the apostles. 


Here Jerome plays with the spiritual interpretation (in 


mysterio) of the fifteen days. Likewise, he says that Paul 
was taught by Peter during these fifteen days and 
instructed in the mystery of the numbers eight and seven 


(ogdoadis et hebdoadis). But this serves no purpose. 
For Paul says in clear words that he came to Jerusalem 
to see Peter and that he stayed with him for fifteen days. 
If he had had to learn the gospel from Peter, he would 
have had to stay there for several years; in fifteen days 
he would not have become such a great apostle and 
teacher of the Gentiles, to say nothing of the fact that in 
these fifteen days, as Lucas testifies in Acts Cap. 9, 28. 
f., he freely preached the name of JEsu and consulted 
with the Greeks 2c. 


V. 20. But what I write to you, behold, God knows 
I am not lying. 


Why does he add an oath? Because he tells the story, 
that is why the 


112 Lri. 6ai. 1, 120-122. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 1, 20-24. 


Noth, so that the churches would believe him. To swear 
that the false apostles could not say: Who knows if Paul 
is telling the truth? 

You see that Paul, the chosen instrument of Christ, 
was so despised that he had to swear by his Galatians, 
to whom he had preached Christ, that he was telling the 
truth. If this happened to the apostles, that they had such 
powerful opponents that they dared to despise them and 
accuse them of lying, what wonder if the same happens 
to us today, who are not worthy to be compared with the 
apostles? He therefore swears, as it seems, in a minor 
matter, that he is telling the truth, namely that he stayed 
with Peter only to see him, but not to learn from him. But 
if you look at the matter more closely, it is a great and 
serious matter, as is evident from the above. So we also 
swear according to Paul's example: God knows that we 
are not lying 2c. 


V. 21. After that I came to the countries of Syria 
and Cilicia. 


Syria and Cilicia are neighboring countries. Here, he 
is constantly concerned with proving that he was, before 





W. VII, I7S2-I709. 11Z 


He said that he had always been a teacher of the 
Gospel, which he had received through the revelation of 
Christ, but he had never been a disciple. 


V. 22-24. But I was unknown to the Christian 
churches in Judea. But they alone had heard that he 
who once persecuted us now preaches the faith which 
he once destroyed, and they praised God over me. 


220 He adds this to draw the conclusion from the 
story that he preached in Syria and Cilicia after seeing 
Peter, and preached there in such a way that he 
received a testimony from all the churches in Judea, as 
if he wanted to say: | appeal to the testimony of all the 
churches in Judea as well. Not only in Damascus, 
Arabia, Syria and Cilicia, but also in Judea, the churches 
testify that | have preached the faith which | used to 
persecute and disturb, and they praise God above me, 
not because | have taught that one must keep 
circumcision and the Law of Moses, but because | have 
preached the faith and edified the churches by my 
ministry of the gospel. So you have the testimony, not 
only of the people of Damascus in Arabia 2c., but also 
of the whole Christian church in Judea 2c. 


The other chapter. 


V. 1. After this, for fourteen years, I went up again 
to Jerusalem. 

1 Paul taught that the Gentiles were justified by faith 
alone, without the work of the law. After he had spread 
this everywhere among the Gentiles, he came to 
Antioch and preached it to the disciples. There, those 
who had been accustomed to the law from their youth 
rose up against Paul because they were displeased that 
he preached to the Gentiles that they were free from the 
law, and a very bitter dispute arose, which later caused 
new unrest. Paul and Barnabas stood firm, testifying 
and saying: 





Everywhere we preached among the Gentiles, the Holy 
Spirit came and fell on those who heard the word, and 
this happened in all the churches of the Gentiles. We did 
not preach circumcision, nor did we require the 
observance of the law, but we preached only faith in 
Christ. And for this preaching of faith in Christ, God gave 
the Holy Spirit to those who heard it. 

2 So the Holy Spirit approves the faith of the Gentiles 
without law and circumcision. For when this preaching of 
the gospel is preached to him

W. VIII, 1709-1712. 115. 





and the faith of the Gentiles in Christ had not fallen, he 
would not have come down Visibly as a sign (visibili 


SiQNO) on the uncircumcised who heard the word. Since 
then, although they alone heard by faith, he fell upon 
them, it is quite certain that the Holy Spirit approved the 
faith of the Gentiles by this sign. For it has never been 
known before that this was done in the preaching of the 
law. This was the proof reason of Paul and Barnabas. 
(3) Then the Jews and many of the Pharisees, who 
had become believers, and yet were still fiercely zealous 
and contended for the preservation of the honor of the 
law, arose with great impetuosity against Paul, who 
maintained that the Gentiles were justified by faith alone, 
without the work of the law, and insisted that the law must 
be kept and the Gentiles must be circumcised, otherwise 
the Gentiles could not be saved. And this was no wonder. 
For the very name: God's law, is holy and terrifying. Even 
a pagan who has never known anything about the law of 
God will truly be moved when he hears: This teaching is 
the law of God. How should those not be moved and fight 
fiercely for the law of God who have been trained in it 
from their earliest youth and to whom it has become flesh 
and blood, as they say? Nowadays we see with what 
tenacity the papists fight for the preservation of their 
statutes and doctrines of the devil. It was much less 
surprising that the Jews fought with such great diligence 
and zeal for their law, which they had received from God. 
4. so great is the power of habit, which makes nature, 
which already has an inclination to the law, so stiff and 
firm [in holding above the law] that when habit is added, 
which has been confirmed by long time and continued 


custom, it becomes the other (duplex) nature. 1) Hence 


1) Here the Latin editions have the correct marginal gloss: Oonsustuio 
altern natura. - This sentence is, as three bracketed words show, 
somewhat deficient and therefore difficult to translate. Menius has 
therefore also helped himself here with a ‘paraphrase’. 





it was impossible for the Jews who had been converted 
to Christ to leave the law immediately. They had 
accepted faith in Christ, but nevertheless believed that 
the law had to be kept at the same time. 

5 And this weakness of theirs God bore for a time, 
until the doctrine of the gospel might be purely separated 
from the law. He also bore the weakness of Israel in the 
time of Ahab, when the people limped on both sides. 
Yes, he also bore our weakness under the papacy, for 
he is patient and very merciful. But we do not have to 
abuse this goodness of God, nor do we have to persist 
in weakness and error, since the truth is revealed to us 
through the light of the Gospel. 

6 Furthermore, those who insisted against Paul that 
the Gentiles must be circumcised had for themselves the 
law of the fathers, the example of the apostles, and 
finally the example of Paul himself, who had circumcised 
Timothy. Therefore, when Paul said that he did this not 
because it was necessary, but in Christian freedom and 
love, so that the weak in faith would not be annoyed, 
who would understand or believe this? Here the whole 
crowd answered him simply: "Since it is obvious that you 
circumcised Timothy, you may say what you will; you did 
it anyway. For this matter is far beyond human 
understanding. Then even a defense is of no use if 
someone has lost the favor (p/ausum) of the people and 
has gotten involved in such a hateful matter. Therefore, 
when Paul saw this strife and clamor increasing daily, 
and he was also warned by a divine revelation, he went 
up to Jerusalem after fourteen years (not counting the 
years he had been preaching in Damascus and Arabia) 
to discuss his gospel with the apostles, not for his own 
sake, but for the sake of the people. 

2) But this dispute, which arose over whether one 
must keep the law, subsequently weighed Paul down for 
a long time and caused him much trouble. However, | do 
not believe that this is the same trade that Lucas 


2) This whole paragraph is missing in Menius.

117 





In the fifteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, which 
seems to have occurred immediately in the beginning of 
the Gospel, but the story that Paul tells here seems to 
have happened long after, since he had already 
preached the Gospel for almost eighteen years. 


With Barnaba and took Titum also with me. 


He takes two witnesses with him, Barnabas and 
Titus. Barnabas helped Paul preach freedom from the 
law among the Gentiles. Then he also witnessed all that 
Paul had done. He had seen how the Gentiles, who were 
not circumcised and free from the law of Moses, had 
been given the Holy Spirit only when preaching faith in 
Christ, and he alone held to Paul in this article that it was 
not necessary to interpret the law to the Gentiles, but 
that it was sufficient for them to believe in Christ. 
Therefore, he testified from his own experience, together 
with Paul, against the Jews who were zealous for the 
law, that the Gentiles would become children of God and 
be saved through faith in Christ alone, without law and 
without circumcision. 

8. but Titus was not only a Christian, but also an 
archbishop, to whom Paul had given the commission to 
order the churches in Crete, Tit. 1, 5. he had been a 
Gentile 2c. 


V. 2. But I went up out of a revelation. 


9 For if Paul had not been warned by a revelation, he 
would not have gone. But because God warned him by 
a special revelation and commanded him to go up, he 
went, so that he might silence, or at least pacify, those 
who had believed from the circumcision and claimed that 
the law must be kept, so that the truth of the gospel might 
shine all the brighter and be confirmed. 


And discussed with them about the Gospel. 


10 So you hear that he came to Jerusalem only after 
eighteen years, and had an interview with the apostles 
about his gospel. 





That I preach among the Gentiles. 

(11) For among the Jews he tolerated the law and 
circumcision for a time, as did the other apostles. He 
says, 1 Cor. 9, 22: "| have become all things to all men", 
but in such a way that the teaching of his gospel would 
remain unharmed, and he absolutely wanted that the 
law, the circumcision, the apostles and an angel from 
heaven should depart from it. For this is what he says to 
the Jews, Apost. 13,38: "Through this Jesus Christ 
forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you (and 
emphatically he adds), of all things by which you could 
not be justified in the law of Moses." That is why he 
everywhere pushes out the doctrine of the Gospel and 
nowhere suffers it to be put in danger. However, he did 
not force his way through once, but took the weak into 
consideration. And so that the weak would not be 
annoyed, he undoubtedly spoke to the Jews in such a 


way: If the useless observance (cultus) of the Mosaic 
Law pleases you - for it does not serve to attain 
righteousness - | will not take it away from you, keep it, 
only that the Gentiles who do not observe it will not be 
burdened with it 2c. 

(12) So Paul admits that he discussed the gospel with 
the apostles, but he says, "They did not give us anything 
or teach us anything, but rather, in order to preserve the 
freedom of the gospel, in view of the apostles, we 
fiercely resisted those who demanded and insisted that 
the Gentiles be charged with the law, and we overcame 
them. Therefore your false apostles lie when they say 
that we circumcised Timothy, that we had the head 
circumcised at Keuchrea, that we went out to Jerusalem, 
[all] by command of the apostles. On the contrary, we 
boast that when we went to Jerusalem by a revelation of 
God, not by command of the apostles, and there 
discussed the gospel with them, we did just the opposite, 
that is, we obtained that the apostles applauded us, not 
those who stood against us. 

13) In this discussion about the Gospel, this question 
was dealt with: whether men are justified without the 
Law. 


118 ki-i. s "i. i, 1W-I2S. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vni, 1715-1719. 119 


or whether keeping the law is necessary for justification? 
Then Paul said: "According to my gospel, which | 
received from God, | preached faith in Christ to the 
Gentiles, not the law, and in this preaching of faith they 
received the Holy Spirit, and for this | have Barnabas as 
a witness. Therefore | conclude that the Gentiles do not 
have to be burdened with the law, that they are not to be 
circumcised either. But | do not deny this to the Jews; if 
they want to keep the law and be circumcised, | allow it; 
only they may do it with a free conscience. In this way | 
have also taught and lived among the Jews, | have 
become a Jew to the Jews 2c. [1 Cor. 9:20], but always 
in such a way that my gospel remained unharmed. 


But especially with those who had the prestige. 


14 That is, | did not confer with the brothers alone, but 
also with those who were the most distinguished. 


So that I would not run or have run in vain. 


(15) Not that Paul doubted whether he was running in 
vain or had run, because he had already preached for 
eighteen years, and it immediately follows in the text that 
he had remained steadfast in his teaching and had been 
right in it; but [he says this’ because many thought that 
he had preached in vain for so many years, because he 
delivered the Gentiles from the law. Then also the false 
opinion grew stronger day by day that the law was 
necessary for justification. Therefore, when he went up 
from Revelation, he wanted to remedy this evil in such a 
way that it would become clear to everyone from this 
conversation that his gospel did not deviate from the 
teaching of the other apostles, in order to shut the 
mouths of the adversaries who would otherwise have 
said that he was running or had run in vain. 

16. casually take heed to this, that this is the fruit 
(virtutem) of one's own righteousness or law, that those 
who teach the same run and live in vain. 


V. 3. But neither was Titus compelled to 
circumcise himself, who was with me, though he was 
a Greek. 


(17) This word, "he was compelled," sufficiently 
indicates the nature of the discussion and _ its 


conclusion, namely this: Circumcision is not to be 
imposed on the Gentiles, but it is to be permitted to the 
Jews for a time, not as if it were necessary for 
righteousness, but out of reverence for the fathers, and 
also for the sake of love, so that the weak may not be 
vexed until they too become strong in the faith. For it 


would have been very ungentlemanly (incivile) if the 
law and the paternal worship, which had been given to 
this people by God Himself with such great glory, had 
been dropped all at once. 

So Paul did not reject circumcision as if it were 
condemned by God, nor did he urge the Jews away from 
it by word or deed. For he says 1 Cor. 7, 18: "If anyone 
is called circumcised, let him not bear witness to 
foreskin." He rejects circumcision as something that is 
not necessary for righteousness, since even the fathers 
were not justified by it, but it only served them as a seal 
of righteousness [faith], Rom. 4, 11, by which they 
testified and practiced their faith. 

19 But the believing Jews, who were still weak and 
zealous for the law, hearing that circumcision was not 
necessary for righteousness, could not understand this 
other than that it was completely useless and 
condemned. And the false apostles strengthened the 
weak in this delusion, so that the people's minds, 
embittered by this adversity - for it seemed to be such - 
were made completely suspicious of Paul's teaching. 

(20) So also today we do not condemn fasting and 
other pious practices as damnable things, but we teach 
that by these practices we do not obtain the forgiveness 
of sins (2c). As soon as the people hear this, they 
immediately judge that we condemn good works, and the 
papists strengthen the people in this opinion by their 
sermons and writings; but they lie and do us wrong. 


120 6ai. 1, 129-131. Explanation d. Galatians 2, 3. 


right. For for many hundreds of years no one has taught 
better and more godly of works than we do now 2c. 
Therefore, circumcision was not rejected by Paul in 
such a way that it was a sin to receive or keep it, for that 
would have caused the Jews a great deal of trouble, but 
in the council and in this discussion it was determined 


(definitum) that it was not necessary for justification and 
therefore not to be imposed on the Gentiles. Thus, the 
means and the cheap provision (éTrieixei") WaS made 
that the Jews should have a period of 

They should not, however, seek to be justified by it, nor 
should they impose it on the Gentiles, because it would 
appear to them as a kind of innovation, but would then 
also be an unbearable burden, Acts 15:10. In short, no 
one should be forced to be circumcised, but no one 
should be kept from circumcision by force. 

(22) This passage of Paul was the subject of a heated 
argument between Jerome and Augustine. The word "he 
was forced" shows that Augustine was right. Jerome did 
not understand the matter. For here it is not spoken of 
what Peter or Paul had done in circumcising or not 
circumcising, as Jerome thinks, and therefore wonders 
how Paul could have presumed to blame Peter for what 
he himself had done, for, he says, Paul circumcised 
Timothy, and lived Gentile with the Gentiles and Jewish 
with the Jews 2c. He does not think that this is a serious 
matter. Therefore, he concludes that neither of them 
sinned, but fabricates that both of them were guilty of 
hypocrisy by lying out of favor (Officioso mendacio). But 
all these questions here were and are serious and 
concern the most important things, therefore they [Peter 
and Paul] did nothing hypocritically. 

This was the main question, whether the law was 
necessary for justification or not. Paul and Peter argue 
about this main proposition, which is the epitome of the 
entire Christian doctrine. Paul was a 





W. VIIL, I71S-1722. 121 


He is too important (gravior) aman to attack and punish 
Peter so freely in the face of the whole church at Antioch 
for the sake of a very trivial matter. So he attacks him for 
the sake of the main article of Christian doctrine. For 
when there were no Jews, Peter ate with the Gentiles, 
but when Jews came there, he separated himself [from 
the Gentiles] 2c. This is why Paul chastises him, that by 


his hypocrisy he urges the Gentiles to live Jewishly (ju- 


daisare). The whole emphasis is on the word: "you 
force"; Jerome did not see that. 

24 Thus Paul did not force anyone who wanted to be 
circumcised to remain uncircumcised, only that he 
should know that circumcision was not necessary for 
justification. Paul wanted to eliminate this compulsion. 
He allowed the Jews to keep the law with a free 
conscience, because he always taught both the Jews 
and the Gentiles that they had to be free in conscience 
from law and circumcision, just as all the patriarchs and 
saints in the Old Testament were free in conscience and 
were justified by faith, not by law or circumcision. 

25 And Paul could have allowed Titus to be 
circumcised, but he did not want to do it because he saw 
that they wanted to force him to do it. For if those who 
insisted on circumcision had obtained it, they would have 
immediately concluded that it was necessary for 
justification, and would have gained the upper hand by 
such permission. 

26. so we also leave everyone free to put on or take 
off a cap, to enter or leave a monastery, to eat meat 
dishes or vegetables, only that he does this freely and 
without offense of conscience, or at least to serve the 
brother, or as an example of love, and not of faith, and 
know that all this does not serve to do enough for the 
sins and to earn grace 2c. 

(27) But just as the false apostles did not leave the 
keeping of the law and circumcision free, but held them 
up as necessary for salvation, so today our adversaries 
claim most strongly that humanity is not a matter of the 
law and circumcision is not a matter of the law. 


122 Lri. 1, 131-133. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1722-1726. 


123 





These laws could not be omitted without risking 
salvation, thus turning the example of love into an 
example of faith, since there is only one example of faith, 
namely, that one believes in Jesus Christ. And as this 
alone is necessary for salvation, so it also concerns all 
men. 

But our adversaries would rather worship the devil 
ten times in God's stead than admit this. Therefore they 
become more and more hardened day by day and want 
to bring in their ungodly nature and their blasphemies 
against God again as before, and defend them by force, 
but do not give way to us a finger's breadth. Therefore, 
in the name of the Lord of hosts, we too want to continue 
fearlessly to glorify the glory of Christ and to fight against 
the kingdom of the Antichrist with word and prayer, so 
that only the name of God may be sanctified, His 
kingdom come, and His will be done. That this may 
happen in a short time, we ask with all our heart, amen, 
amen. 

(29) This was a glorious triumph for Paul, that Titus 
the Gentile, who had been placed in the midst of all the 
apostles and believers, where this question was so 
vehemently disputed, was not forced to be circumcised. 
This triumph Paul carried away, and he says that it was 
established by this conversation, with the consent of all 
the apostles and with the approval of the whole church, 
that Titus should not be circumcised. This is a strong and 
firm and very weighty proof against the false apostles. 
And Paul knows how to drive his enemies into a corner 
and to press them hard with this proof: "Titus was also 
not forced" 2c., as if he wanted to say: How the false 
apostles speak so lyingly against me, that | was forced 
to keep the circumcision, while it is the apostles who 


have just made this determination (mandantibus) [that 
Titus should not be forced to circumcision], since | have 
the testimony of all the believers in Jerusalem, yes, also 
of the apostles themselves, that at my instigation the 
opposite was decided. And there | did not only win the 
victory that Titus remained uncircumcised, 


but have obtained the victory by the consent and 
approval of the apostles. So your false apostles are lying, 
that they are hypnotizing me under the name of the 
apostles and deceiving you with it, because | did not have 
the apostles and all believers against me, but on my side, 
and | prove this with this example of Titus. 

(30) But Paul, as | have often said, did not condemn 
circumcision as something useless, nor did he force 
anyone to be circumcised, because in it there is neither 
sin nor righteousness, whether one is circumcised or 
uncircumcised, just as eating and drinking is neither sin 
nor righteousness. For whether thou eatest or eatest not, 
thou shalt not be better or worse for it, 1 Cor. 8:8. But if 
any man come and put sin or righteousness into it, 
saying, If thou eatest, thou sinest; if thou eatest not, thou 
art righteous; or again, he would be foolish and ungodly. 

Therefore, it is ungodliness if one wants to deal with 
ceremonies in such a way that sin or righteousness is 
attached to them, as the pope does, who threatens in his 
banishment formula that all who do not obey the pope's 
laws would thereby put their souls in danger. Therefore, 
he makes all his laws necessary for salvation. 

Therefore the devil speaks through the pope and his 
decrees. For if salvation is in keeping the laws of the 
pope, what need have we of Christ as a justifier and a 
beatifier? 1) 


For when some false brethren had intruded, and 
crept in beside us, to make known our liberty which 
we have in Christ JEsu, that they might take us 
captive, we departed not one hour from being subject 
unto them, that the truth of the gospel might stand 
with you. 


Here Paul shows the reason why he went to 
Jerusalem and discussed his gospel with the apostles. 


1) Here Menius has inserted a longer section as § 32, which is not 
found in the Latin original. In order to maintain the same numbering of 
paragraphs as in Walch's old edition, we have separated the 
preceding section from § 31 and made a special paragraph out of it. 


124 2ri. 1, 133-135. Explanation of Galatians 2, 4. 5. W. 


and did not want Titus to be circumcised, not so that he 
could be assured of the gospel through the apostles and 
be strengthened in it, for he had no doubt about that, but 
"so that the truth of the gospel might stand" among the 
Galatians and all the churches of the Gentiles. Therefore 
you see that this trade of Paul was not a joke or a small 
thing. 

(34) When he says, "The truth of the gospel," he 
indicates that there is a twofold gospel, one true and one 
false. The gospel itself is only one, simple, true and pure, 
but it is counterfeited and perverted by the wickedness 
of Satan's servants. Therefore, since he says, "The truth 
of the gospel," he wants to be understood also that 
which is contrary [to the truth], as if to say: The false 
apostles also preach the faith and the gospel, but both 
are false; and therefore | have so vehemently opposed 
them, and by this my obstinacy, that | would not yield to 
them 1) | have brought this about, that the truth of the 
gospel endures with you. 

(35) Thus, today, the pope and the spirits boast that 
they teach the gospel and faith in Christ. They do teach 
this, but with the same benefit as formerly the false 
apostles, of whom Paul says above, Cap. 1, 7, that they 
confuse the churches and pervert the gospel of Christ 
2c. On the other hand, he says that he teaches the truth 
of the gospel, that is, the pure and true gospel, as if to 
say: What the false apostles teach, though they speak 
certain truth, is nothing but lies. Those who hear them 
receive from them empty talk (vanitatem) and lies 
instead of the gospel. In this way, all heretics pretend to 
the name of God, Christ, the Church 2c. They also 
promise that they do not want to teach lies and errors, 
but the absolute truth and the completely pure gospel. 

(36) Now it is the truth of the gospel that our 
righteousness is by faith alone, without the works of the 


law. The untruth (falsitas) or the falsification 


1) Wittenberger: ersasrs instead of esasrs. 


VII, 1726-1729. 125 


of the gospel is that we are justified by faith, but not 
without the works of the law. With this condition attached, 
the false apostles preached the gospel. 


(37) The school theologians (Sophistae 
scholastics) and our papists have done the same, 
namely, one must believe in Christ, and faith is the 
reason for salvation, but it does not justify if it has not 


gained a form through love (fides formata caritate). 
This is not the truth, but an appearance and fictitious 
pretense of the gospel. The true gospel, however, is that 
works or love are not the adornment or completion of 
faith, but that faith, in itself, is the gift of God and the work 
of God in the heart, which therefore justifies because it 
takes hold of the Savior Christ Himself. Human reason 


has to do with the law (objectum habet legem): | have 
done this, | have not done that. But faith, when it is in its 
actual office, has nothing else to do with than with Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, who was given for the sins of the 
whole world. He does not focus on love, he does not say: 
What have | done? What have | sinned? What have | 
deserved? but: What did Christ do? What did he 
deserve? There speaks the truth of the gospel: He has 
redeemed you from sin, from the devil, from eternal 
death. Therefore faith recognizes that in this person, 
Jesus Christ, it has forgiveness of sins and eternal life. 


Whoever steps out of this circle (objecto = objects, with 
which faith has to do), does not have true faith, but an 
empty appearance and delusion and turns his eyes from 
the promise to the law, which arouses terror and drives 
to despair. 

(38) Therefore, what the scholastic theologians have 
taught, that faith justifies when it has gained a form 
through love, is nothing but a ringing with strange words 
(mera verborum portenta). For the faith that takes hold 
of Christ, the Son of God, and is adorned by him, 
justifies; not the faith that includes love. For if faith is to 
be certain and firm, it must take hold of nothing but Christ 
alone, 





126 Li-I. Sai. 1, 135-137. 


Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1729-1732. 


127 





and can lean on nothing else in the struggle and terror 
of the conscience but this pearl. Therefore, no matter 
how much the law terrifies him, no matter how much the 
burden of sins weighs him down, he who takes hold of 
Christ in faith can still boast that he is righteous. How or 
by what? Through the precious stone of Christ, which he 
possesses in faith. 

(39) Our adversaries do not understand this, so they 
throw away the precious stone of Christ and put in its 
place love, which they say is the precious stone. But 
since they do not know what faith is, it is impossible for 
them to have faith, much less to teach it to others. But 
what they have is a dream, a delusion and natural 
reason, not faith. 

40 | say this for this reason, so that you may 
understand that Paul says with special emphasis, "the 
truth of the gospel," in order to rebuke the opposite. For 
with these words he drags through the false apostles 
and accuses them of having taught a false gospel, for 
they insisted on circumcision and the keeping of the law 
as necessary for salvation. Then they persecuted Paul 
with great cunning and deceit. They were waiting to see 
if he would circumcise Titus and if he would dare to resist 
them in the presence of the apostles. Therefore he 
smites them with very fierce words. They wanted, he 
says, to make known our freedom, which we have in 
Christ, that they would take us captive. Therefore, the 
false apostles prepared themselves with all their might 
and had everything ready against Paul in order to 
denigrate and suppress him in every possible way in 
front of the whole church. 

(41) And to this they would take advantage of the 
reputation of the apostles, accusing him in_ their 
presence, saying, "Paul, though uncircumcised, brings 
Titus into the assembly of all believers, denying and 
condemning the law in your presence, the apostles. If he 
now dares to oppose it here, what should he not 
presume to do among the Gentiles, where you are not 
present? When he saw that he was being attacked with 
these plots, he resisted the false apostles most strongly 
and said: 





We did not want to let our freedom, which we have in 
Christ JEsu, be endangered, however much the false 
brethren pursued us and pressed us, but, since the 
apostles themselves were judges of it, we overcame 
them and did not want to give way to them even for one 
hour (for no doubt they will have said: Dear Paul, give in 
to this freedom at least for a little while), because we saw 
that they insisted on the law in such a way as if it were 
necessary for salvation. If they had only asked for an 
indulgence out of brotherly love, Paul would have given 
way to them, but they were looking for something else, 
namely, that they might imprison Paul and all who 
adhered to his teaching. That is why he did not want to 
give way to them even for a moment. 

(42) Thus we also offer ourselves against the papists 
in all things that can be refrained from, and more than 
we ought to do, excepting only the liberty of conscience 
which we have in Christ Jesus. For we do not want to be 
forced or have our consciences bound to any work, as if, 
if we do this or that, we are righteous, but if we omit it, 
we are condemned. For we want to use the same food 
as they do, we want to keep their holidays and fasts, if 
they would only let us keep all this of our own free will, 
and let these threatening words, with which they have so 
far frightened and subjugated the whole world, stand: 
We command, we impose, we impose again, we put 
under ban 2c. But this we cannot obtain, that they let us 
have this freedom, just as Paul could not obtain it at that 
time. Therefore we do just as he did. For since he could 
not obtain this liberty, he would not yield one hour to the 
false apostles. 

43 Just as the adversaries do not want to leave us 
unharmed that faith alone in Christ alone makes us 
righteous, so we do not want to and cannot give way to 
them in this matter either, that faith, which has gained a 
form through love, justifies. Here we want to and must 
rebel against it and be persistent, otherwise we would 
lose the truth of the gospel, we would-

129 





We would lose our freedom, which we do not have in the 
emperor, kings, princes, not in the pope, the world, flesh, 
blood, reason 2c., but in Christ JEsu; we would lose faith 
in Christ, who, as | said above, grasps nothing else but 
the precious stone Christ. 

(44) If the adversaries would leave us untouched 


(salvam) this faith, by which we are born again, justified 
and implanted in Christ, we offer to do everything, if only 
it does not conflict with this faith. But since we cannot 
obtain this from them, we in turn do not want to yield to 
them in the slightest. For this is a serious and great 
matter, namely the death of the Son of God, who became 
man according to the will and by the command of the 
Father, was crucified and died for the sins of the whole 
world. If faith gives way here, this death, resurrection 2c. 
of the Son of GOD is in vain, it is then also a fable that 
Christ is the Savior of the world, indeed, GOD Himself is 
invented a liar, because He did not keep what He 
promised. Our persistence in this matter is therefore a 
godly and holy one. For by this alone we seek to preserve 
our freedom, which we have in Christ Jesus, and to keep 
the truth of the gospel. For if we lose this, we lose God, 
Christ, all promises, faith, righteousness and eternal life. 

(45) But someone would say, "The law is divine and 
holy. It has its honor after all, but no law, be it as divine 
and holy as it can be, shall teach me that | am justified 
thereby and attain life. | admit that it teaches me that | 
should love God and my neighbor, likewise live in 
chastity, patience, etc., but it should not show me how | 
should be freed from sins, the devil, death and hell. 

Here | am to consult and hear the gospel, which 
teaches, not what | should do, for that is the proper office 
of the law, but what Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has 
done for me, namely, that he suffered and died for me to) 
set me free from sin and death. 


This is what the gospel commands me to accept and 
believe, and this is and is called the truth of the gospel. 

(47) And this is the main article of the whole Christian 
doctrine, in which the knowledge of all godliness 
consists. Therefore, it is most important that it be well 
known and constantly emphasized. For, as it is 
exceedingly tender, so it is also very easily violated. Paul 
experienced this, and so do all the godly. 

48 In short, Paul did not want to circumcise Titus for 
no other reason than, as he says, because some false 
brethren had intruded with him to make known the 
freedom 2c. who wanted to force Paul to circumcise him. 
When Paul saw this compulsion and need, he would not 
yield to them even for an hour, but resisted them with all 
his might, and therefore says: "Even Titus, who was with 
me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he 
were a Gentile" 2c. If they had demanded this of him 
according to the law of love or as a brotherly service, he 
would not have refused them, but because they wanted 
it and insisted that this should be done as an evil 
example to take the consciences captive and destroy the 
whole gospel, he resisted them most strongly and 
prevailed and obtained that Titus should not be 
circumcised. 

(49) It seems to be a very small matter whether one 
is circumcised or not, but if it is because one puts his 
trust in the fact that he has been circumcised, or is afraid 
if circumcision has not been performed, then God is 
denied, as well as Christ, grace and all the promises of 
God. Otherwise, if circumcision were kept without this 
addition, there would be no danger. 

50 So also, if the pope required his statutes to be 
nothing but ceremonies, it would not be burdensome for 
us to observe them. For what burden could it be if one 
had to wear a cap? or a plate? as we also use 
ceremonies. But if one hangs this great evil on the fact 
that in this trivial, 


130 Nri. OLi. 1, 140-142. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1735-1739. 


The fact that the name of a man is to stand for either life 
and salvation or death and eternal damnation is 
diabolical and blasphemous. Whoever does not raise his 
voice against this, let him be accursed. | can eat, drink, 
wear a cap and do everything that the pope has 
prescribed, if he only wanted to let all this be free. Now, 
however, since he wants to demand this as necessary 
for salvation, and bind consciences to it, and make these 
things a service pleasing to God, one must completely 
oppose it. There would be no harm in making a sculpture 
out of wood or stone, or a cast image pillar, but to make 
a service out of it, and to attach the deity to the wood or 
stone or the image pillar, that is, to worship an idol as 
God. 

(51) Therefore, we must pay careful attention to what 
Paul is talking about here, so that we do not fall into 
inconsistencies with Jerome, who thought that the 
question and the trade was about the matter [of 
circumcision] itself. In this he was mistaken. For this is 
not the trade whether wood is wood, whether stone is 
stone, but of the addition, that is, how these things are 
to be used, whether this wood is GOD, or whether in this 
stone the Godhead dwells. Here we answer: Let wood 
be wood 2c. Circumcision is nothing, foreskin is nothing, 
says Paul [1 Cor. 7:19], but if one bases his 
righteousness on it, pays reverence to it, places 
confidence in it that he will be saved by it, or fears that 
he will earn [eternal] death by these things, that is, 
attaches deity to external statutes (ceremoniis). 
Therefore one must not give way to the adversaries 
even in the smallest part, just as Paul did not give way 
to the false apostles, because neither circumcision nor 
foreskin, neither plate nor cap, belongs’ to 
righteousness, but only and pure grace. This is the truth 
of the Gospel. 


V. 6 But of those who had the reputation of what 
they once were, I have no concern. 
This speech is one in which something is left out 


(ecliptica), because it is missing: "| have received 
nothing". But it must be credited to the Holy Spirit who 
speaks in Paul. 


131 


He is very eager to speak, but he does not hold his 
tongue when he violates grammar. He speaks with great 
zeal. But the one who is in the heat cannot observe the 
grammatical rules and the rhetorical regulations very 
carefully when speaking. 

But this is a very vehement and proud refutation. For 
he does not even give the right apostles their title of 
honor, but says with a kind of disparagement: "who had 


the prestige", that is, who had the authority (erant in 
auctoritate), on whose wave and shaking of the head 


(renutu) everything depended. But in fact, the apostles 
had a very great prestige among all the churches, and 
Paul does not take away any of their honor. But he 
answers the false apostles so contemptuously, who 
everywhere held against Paul the reputation and the 
greatness of the apostles and their disciples, in order to 
belittle the reputation of Paul and to make his whole 
ministry suspicious. 

Paul could not suffer this in any way. In order that the 
truth of the gospel and the freedom of conscience in 
Christ might endure among the Galatians and all the 
churches of the Gentiles, he answered the false apostles 
very proudly that he did not care how great the apostles 
were or what kind of apostles they had been in the past; 
furthermore, it did not bother him much that the prestige 
of the apostolic name was held against him by them. The 
apostles are certainly something important, and their 
reputation must be highly honored, but for this reason it 
cannot be admitted that for the sake of any name or title, 
no matter how great, whether that of an apostle or an 
angel from heaven, his gospel or his ministry should be 
endangered. 

155) And this reason was one of the strongest among 
those which the false apostles insisted on very strongly, 
namely in this way: The apostles lived with Christ for 
three years on quite intimate terms, heard and saw all 
his preaching and miracles, yes, they themselves also 
preached and did miracles while Christ still walked on 
earth. Paul, however, never saw him in the flesh. 


1) The following until towards the end of § 56 is used by Aurifaber 
for the Table Talks, Cap. 1, § 61, and introduced with the words: 
"Doctor Luther said". In our edition of the Tischreden, this section is 
omitted.

(in Carn€) and was converted only long after his 
glorification. What they [the Galatians] meant, which of 
the two should be believed? The one Paul, who was only 
a disciple and a later one at that, or the highest and 
greatest apostles, who were sent and confirmed by 
Christ himself long before Paul? 

(56) To this Paul replies, "What else? This reason 
proves nothing. They may be great apostles after all, 
they may be angels from heaven, | do not care about 
that. We are not talking about the greatness of the 
apostles, but about the word of God and the truth of the 
Gospel. It is very important that this be preserved 
unharmed, and this must also have priority. Therefore, 
we are not interested in how great Peter and the other 
apostles were, how many and how great miracles they 
may have performed. We deal with this, that the truth of 
the gospel may stand with you. This responsibility seems 
to be quite weak, that he deliberately despises the 
reputation of the apostles, which is held against him by 
the false apostles, and does not oppose this their 
strongest reason of proof with any other counterproof 
than this: "There is nothing in it for me." But he adds a 
reason to this refutation: 


For GOD _ does the 
reputation of men. 

57. he draws this saying from Moses, who used it 
more often [Deut. 1, 17. 16, 19. 2 Deut. 23, 6.]: "No 
person shall you look upon in judgment, neither the rich 


nor the poor" 2c. and it is a guideline 


(yvwun = a generally valid saying) or a 
theological judgment: God does not look at the person, 
and with this saying he shuts up the false teachers, as if 
he wanted to say: You hold against me those who have 
the reputation 2c. But God does not care about such 
things, he does not look at apostleship, not at bishopric, 
not at principality, he does not look at honor, at prestige 
2c. and therefore as a sign he let one of the most 
distinguished apostles, namely Judas, fall and be 
condemned, likewise also one of the highest kings, 
namely the first one, namely Saul. Ishmael and Esau, 
who were both 


not respect 


who had the firstborn, he rejected. Thus, you will find 
throughout Scripture that God very often rejected those 
people who were the best and holiest in reputation. 

And sometimes it seems as if God was cruel in such 
examples. But it was and still is of the utmost necessity 
that these horrible examples should happen and be 
described. For this error is inherent in our nature, that we 
admire the persons and regard them more than the word. 
On the other hand, God wants us to pay attention to the 
word and to base ourselves firmly on it; He wants us to 
choose the kernel and not the shell, to care more about 
the father of the house than about the house. He does 
not want us to admire and revere the apostleship of Peter 
and Paul, but Christ, who speaks through them, and 
God's word itself, which they bring and preach to us. 


The natural (animalis) man cannot distinguish this, 
only the spiritual man distinguishes the person from the 
word, the divine larva from God Himself. But all creatures 
are the larva of God. Moreover, God does not deal with 
us face to face in this life, but veiled and under a larva, 
that is, as Paul says [1 Cor. 13:12]: "We see Him now 
through a mirror in a dark word, but then face to face." 

(60) Therefore, we cannot do without the larvae, but 
wisdom is needed to distinguish God from the larva, 
which the world does not have. When a miser hears that 
man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that 
passes through the mouth of God, he eats the bread, but 
does not see God in the bread, because he only looks at 
the larva. He does the same with gold and other 
creatures; he trusts only as long as he has them, but 
when they are lacking, he despairs. Therefore, he does 
not worship the Creator, but the creature, not God, but 
the belly. 

(61) | say this so that no one will think that Paul 
absolutely rejects and despises persons and bodies. For 
he does not say that there must be no person, but that 
before God there is no respect for persons. For.

135 


they must be persons and larvae, and God has given 


them, and they are His good creatures, but we are not 
to worship and adore them. In the custom of things, not 
in the things themselves, lies all power, as | also said 
above [§51]. The fault is not in the circumcision or in the 
foreskin (for circumcision is nothing, foreskin is nothing), 
but in the custom. But if one wants to worship and adore 
circumcision and make a righteousness out of it, and a 
sin out of the foreskin, this is a damned custom which 
must be done away with; when this is done away with, 
circumcision and foreskin are good things. 

Thus, the authorities, emperor, king, prince, mayor, 
doctor, preacher, teacher, pupil, father, mother, 
children, master, servant 2c. Persons or larvae whom 
God wants recognized as His creatures and held in all 
honor, which must also be in this life. But he does not 
want us to attach deity to them, that is, to fear and revere 
them, to trust in them and forget him. 

63) And in order that God may the more easily draw 
us away from the admiration of persons, He causes sins 
to be committed against them, and causes them to fall, 
grievously and shamefully, 1) so that we may be 
reminded to distinguish between God and a person. So 
that David, the best king, would not be considered a 
perfon in whom one should put one's trust, God caused 
him to fall into heinous sins, as adultery, death 2c. The 
apostle Peter denied Christ. 2) These and similar 
examples, of which Scripture is full, are to warn us that 
we should not be attached to the person, nor should we 
think that if we have the person, we have everything (as 
happens in Pabbism, where everything is judged 
according to outward appearance; therefore it is quite 
unacceptable to think that we have everything). 


1) Here, too, Menius translates incorrectly: "That is why our Lord 
God allows it to happen that one sometimes runs hard against such 
larvae and sins grossly" 2c. From this we see that Luther did not 
check this translation more closely, or at least did not have his 
improving hand on it. 

2) The following, from here to the end of this paragraph, is 
included by Aurifaber in Cap. 1, 8 61 of the Table Talks. In our edition 
of the Table Talks, this piece is omitted. 


and nothing at all but a reputation of the person) 
(TmooowToAnwia). 

God has given all creatures for use and custom, not 
for worship and service. Use therefore the bread, wine, 
garments, goods, gold 2c., but do not trust in them and 
do not boast in them. For God alone is to be boasted of 
and trusted in; he alone is to be loved, feared and 
honored. 

But here Paul understands by "the reputation of men" 
the apostolate or ministry of the apostles, who certainly 
performed many miraculous signs, taught many and 
converted them to the faith, and kept in intimate contact 


with Christ; in short, "the reputation" (persona) means 
the whole outward conduct of the apostles, which was 
holy, and their authority (auctoritatem), which was 
great. But GOtte does not care about this, he says, not 
that he does not care about it at all, but that he does not 
care about it where justification is concerned, no matter 
how great and glorious these things may be. 

For we must carefully keep in mind this difference, 
that we speak of things quite differently in theology than 
in the world regiment. In the world regiment, God wants 
these persons to be honored, as | have said, as His 
larvae and instruments through which He governs and 
sustains the well. But when you come to the area of 
religion, where it concerns conscience, fear, trust, 
worship, no one should fear any person, no one should 
trust in him, no one should expect comfort from him, no 
one should hope that through him he can become 
physically or spiritually free. 

5Therefore, God does not want the person to be 
considered in the court. For the judgment is God's 
business. Therefore, | shall neither fear nor love the 
judge, but my fear and confidence shall be in God, who 
is the right judge. | should indeed honor the worldly 
judge as a larva of God, and give him all honor for God's 
sake, but my conscience should be set on the judge. 


3) This and the following paragraph is used by Aurifaber for Cap. 
1, B 61 of the Tischreden. In our edition of the Table Talks, this 
paragraph has been omitted. 


136 Lri. 0-0. 1, 146-148. Explanation of Galatians 2, 6, W. VIII, 1745-1748. 


| will not trust and rely on his justice and righteousness, 
nor be frightened by his injustice and tyranny, that | 
should do anything against God, that is, that | should 
offend [God] with lies, with speaking false testimony, 
with denying the truth. Otherwise, | will gladly do honor 
to the judge. 

(68) So | would honor the pope and do all honor to 
his person, if he left my conscience free and did not force 
me to sin against God. But he wants to be so feared and 
honored that one thereby offends the divine majesty. If 
one must lose one of the two, then let the person go and 
keep God. We would gladly bear the rule of the pope, 
but because he abuses it against us and wants to force 
us to deny and blaspheme God and to acknowledge him 
alone as Lord, and wants to bind and force our 
consciences against fear and trust in God, we are forced 
by God's command to oppose the pope, for it is written 
[Apost. 5:29]: "One must obey God more than men." 

69 Therefore, we despise the reputation of the pope 
without offense of conscience, which is very comforting 
to us. Muenzer and other furious people also wanted the 
pope dead. But they wanted to do it with weapons, not 
with words, so they resisted him for the sake of the 
person, not for the sake of God. We would gladly grant 
the Behemoth and his scales all the prestige of the 


persons (D€rSonas) and dignities they have, if only they 
would let us have Christ. But since we cannot obtain this 
from them, we despise their being built on the distinction 
of persons (personatum) and confidently say with Paul: 
"God does not respect the reputation of men." 

Therefore, the emphasis is on the word "God," for in 
matters of religion and the word of God, the person is not 
to be considered in any way. But if one asks about it 
outside of religion and where it does not concern God, 
then the answer is that 


1) i.e. the pope and his entire appendix. 





137 


There must be respect for the person, and the person 
must look at the person, so that a disorderly being does 
not arise, and all respect and good order is not 
abolished. For in this area God wants order, respect and 
distinction of persons to be maintained. Otherwise, a 
son, a disciple, a subject, a servant would say: | am as 
much a Christian as my father, teacher, prince, lord 2c. 
Why then should | give him honor? Therefore in the sight 
of God all distinction of person ceases, there is neither 
Greek nor Jew, but all are one in Christ [Gal. 3, 28], but 
in the sight of the race it is not the same 2c. 

Thus Paul refutes the argument of the false apostles, 
which is taken from the reputation of the apostles, by 
saying that it is not timely, does not prove anything here, 
and therefore does not belong to the matter, because 
here amuch more important matter is dealt with than the 
reputation of the persons, namely, a divine matter, of 
God, of the word of God, namely, whether it should be 
preferred to the apostleship or vice versa. Paul 
answered: "So that the truth of the gospel may stand, so 
that the word of God and the righteousness of faith may 
be preserved unharmed and pure - away with the 
apostleship, away with an angel from heaven, away with 
Paul and Peter. 


But those who had the reputation 
taught me nothing else. 


72 As if to say: | did not confer with the apostles for 
this reason, or set myself to confer with them, that they 
should teach me. For what could they have taught me? 
Since Christ had taught me abundantly about everything 
by His revelation, and | had been preaching the gospel 
among the Gentiles for eighteen years, and Christ had 
performed so many miracles through me, by which He 
confirmed my preaching. Therefore it was only a friendly 


conversation (COllatio), not the discussion of a doubtful 
question (disputatio), in which | learned nothing, neither 


recanted nor defended myself, but | simply told what had 
happened through me.

139 





This is that | preached faith in Christ alone without the law 
to the Gentiles, and that during this preaching of faith the 
Holy Spirit fell on the Gentiles, who immediately spoke in 
different languages. When the apostles heard this, they 
testified that | had taught rightly. Therefore, the false 
apostles who pervert this do me wrong 2c. 

73 And this pride of Paul's, that he says the other 
apostles taught him nothing, is not reprehensible, but 
exceedingly necessary. For if he had given way here, the 
truth of the gospel would have perished. Much less 
should we give way to our adversaries, who against us 
extol the prestige of their idol, the pope, since Paul here 
did not want to give way to the false apostles, who against 
him extolled the prestige of the true apostles. | know that 
the godly should be humble, but against the pope | want 
and must be hopeful with holy pride, namely thus: "Pope, 
| do not want to be subject to you, nor do | want to have 
you as a teacher, because | am certain that my teaching 
is right and divine. 

But the pope does not want to hear these, yes, he 
wants to force me to obey his laws and decrees, and if | 
do not obey, he puts me under ban and condemns me as 
a heretic and apostate from the church. Therefore, our 
pride against the pope is most necessary, and if we did 
not have this pride, and through the Holy Spirit despised 
him with fine doctrine, and the devil, the father of lies, who 
speaks in him, we could in no way keep the article of 
justification by faith. Therefore, we do not despise the 
prestige of the pope because we ourselves want to rule} 
1) nor do we deal with it by wanting to exalt ourselves 
above the highest rulers, since it is in the day that w 


(75) If the Pope were to admit to us that God alone 
justifies sinners by mere grace through Christ, we would 
not only want to carry him on our hands, but also to kiss 
his feet. But because we cannot attain this, we are again 
proud beyond measure in God, and will not yield one 
finger to all the angels in heaven, nor to Peter or Paul, nor 
to a hundred emperors, nor to a thousand popes, nor to 
the whole world. Far be all humility here, because they 
want to rob us of our honor, God Himself, who created us 
and gave us everything, Christ Himself, who redeemed us 
through His blood. 

This shall be the sum of this matter: 2) We are to let 
ourselves be robbed of our goods, our good name, our 
life and all that we have; that the gospel, the faith, Christ 
2c. should be taken from us, we are not to tolerate that, 
and cursed be the humility which can be found here 
yielding. Here every man should be proud and quite 
stubborn, if he will not deny Christ. 

Therefore, if God wills, my head shall be harder than 
the head of all men. Here | want to be hard and also be 
considered hard; here | lead the motto: / yield to no one, 
and rejoice with all my heart that | am called rebellious 
and stubborn in this matter. Here | publicly confess that | 
am tough and want to be tough, and will not yield a hair's 
breadth. 

78) Love, which endures everything, believes 
everything, hopes everything [1 Cor. 13:7], on the other 





hand faith does not yield, yes, it can tolerate nothing at 
all, as this common saying says: discipline and honor, 
faith and eye suffer no joking. 3) Therefore a Christian 
should be exceedingly proud and stubborn in everything 


teach that every man should be humble, submissive, concerning faith, suffer nothing at all, yield to no one even 
subject to authority, but that we seek that the glory of God} a hair's breadth, for through faith man becomes God, 2 
may remain and the righteousness of faith may be| Petr. 1, 4. But God suffers nothing, yields to no one, for

(salvi). therefore it should not suffer anything. 


2) Menius has drawn these words to the preceding, but they belong 
to the following. . 

3) Thus Luther cites this proverb (Xon patitur luciuin kaum, UU68, 
ooulu8) with the addition: "one soon corrupted all three", in the

suffer, give way to no one. But after love the Christian 
should yield and suffer everything, because there he is 
only a pure man. 


V. 7. 8. But again, when they saw that I was 
trusted with the gospel to the foreskin, as Petro was 
with the gospel to the circumcision (for he that was 
strong with Petro to the apostleship among the 
circumcision, the same was strong with me among 
the Gentiles). 


This is a very strong responsibility against the false 
apostles. Here Paul claims and attaches to himself the 
same prestige that the false apostles boasted of the true 
apostles, and uses their own oratory against them. The 
false apostles, he says, invoke the prestige of the great 
apostles for their cause against me, but | invoke the 
same for my cause against them. For the apostles are 
on my side. Therefore, dear Galatians, do not believe 
those who boast about the prestige of the apostles 
against me, for when they saw that the gospel was 
entrusted to my foreskin and recognized the grace that 
was given to me, they gave me and Barnaba their right 
hands and became one with us, acknowledging my 
ministry and thanking God for the grace that was given 
to me. 

Thus he masterfully turns the evidence of the 
adversaries against themselves. And in these words he 
is all fire and flames and his emotion is stronger than he 
could have expressed in words. That is why Paul did not 
pay attention to the grammar and broke the 
construction. 

(81) But when he says, "Who were regarded as 
pillars," this was not an empty expression (fucus), but 
they were indeed regarded as pillars. For the apostles 
were held in high esteem and honor throughout the 
church, and they had the authority to approve and 
proclaim the right doctrine and to reject the wrong 
doctrine. 

This is a strange text, that Paul says that the gospel 
to the foreskin is familiar to him, to Peter to the 
circumcision, since Paul preached almost everywhere to 
the Jews in their schools, and Peter also to the Gentiles. 
For both we have testimonies and examples 





141 


in the Acts of the Apostles. Peter converted the 
centurion [Cornelius] with his whole household, who was 
a Gentile [Acts 10], after which he wrote to the Gentiles, 
as his first letter testifies. Paul, who preaches Christ 
among the Gentiles, nevertheless also goes to the 
schools of the Jews and teaches the gospel there 
[Apost. 9, 20. ff.]. And in Marcus [Cap. 16, 15.] and 
Matthew [Cap. 28, 19.] Christ commands all the 
apostles, saying, "Go ye into all the world, and preach 
the gospel to every creature." And Paul says, Col. 1, 23, 
that the gospel is preached to every creature under 
heaven. Why then does he only call himself the apostle 
to the Gentiles and Peter and the others the apostles of 
the circumcision? 

This question is not difficult to answer. Paul has in 
mind that the other apostles remained mainly in Judea 
and Jerusalem until, when God called them, they went 
elsewhere. For a while, the situation was such that as 
long as the Jewish empire lasted, they were in the 
Jewish land, but when the destruction was imminent, 
they scattered all over the world. Paul, however, as it is 
written in the Acts of the Apostles, Cap. 13, 2. s9, 15.], 
was chosen by a special calling to be an apostle to the 
Gentiles, and since he was sent from the Jewish 
country, he wandered through the countries of the 
Gentiles. Moreover, the Jews at that time were scattered 
almost all over the world and lived everywhere in the 
cities and towns of the Gentiles. Therefore, when Paul 
went there, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, he 
used to go to the schools of the Jews, and on that 
occasion he first brought them, as the children of the 
kingdom, this joyful message that the promises which 
the fathers had received were now fulfilled in Christ 2c. 
Since they did not want to hear this, he went to the 
Gentiles, as Lucas testifies Apost. 13, 46, where he 
introduces Paul speaking against the Jews who were 
zealous for the law and contradicted what he said, and 
reports that he confidently said: "The word of God had 
to be spoken to you first, but now you reject it and do not 
consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, behold, we 
turn to the Gentiles." And Apost. 28, 28: "So be it unto 
you

143 





that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, 
and they will hear it. 

For this reason he was sent mainly to the Gentiles. 
Because he was everyone's debtor (Rom. 1, 14) and 
became everyone of all kinds (1 Cor. 9, 22), he went, 
when he had the opportunity, to the schools of the Jews, 
where not only Jews but also Gentiles heard him preach 
the gospel of Christ. Otherwise, he preached publicly to 
the Gentiles in the marketplace, in houses, and by 
rivers. He was therefore mainly the apostle to the 
Gentiles, as Peter was the apostle to the Jews, but in 
such a way that the latter also preached Christ to the 
Gentiles when the opportunity presented itself 2c. 

He calls the Gentiles the foreskin, the Jews the 


circumcision according to the synecdoche, a figure of 
speech, which is used very often in the holy scriptures, 
namely, that one part stands for the whole. So the 
gospel to the foreskin is the one that should be brought 
to the Gentiles. Of this he says that it was entrusted to 
him, just as Peter was entrusted with the gospel to the 
circumcision, for as Peter spread the gospel of Christ 
among the Jews, so he spread it among the Gentiles. 
Here it must be noted in passing that the Hebrews 
use the construction of the genitive in different ways, 


sometimes active (activa, i.e. genitivus subjectivus), 
genitivus 


objectivus), whereby the meaning often becomes 
obscure. There are frequent examples of this 
everywhere in Paul and in all of Scripture, as, this 
speech: "the glory of God" is somewhat obscure, 
because it can be interpreted in an active and in a 
suffering way. The glory of God in an active way is the 
glory that God Himself praises in Himself; but in a 
suffering way the glory that we praise in God. Likewise 
also: the faith of Christ 2c. We usually interpret such 
sayings in a suffering way, so that "the faith of Christ" is 
the faith through which we believe in Christ. Thus, "the 
gospel of God" in an active way means the gospel that 
God alone gives and sends into the world; "the gospel 
of the foreskin and the circumcision" in an active way 
means the gospel that was sent to the Gentiles and the 
Jews and received by them. 


sometimes suffering (passive, i.e. 





(87) Paul continues to emphasize that James, Peter 
and John, who were considered pillars, did not teach 
him anything, and that they did not command him the 
ministry of the gospel as fine superiors and superiors 
(ordinatores = who ordain someone to the ministry of 
preaching), because they had no authority to teach him, 
to command him or to send him. Therefore he does not 
acknowledge them as fine teachers and as his superiors 
who ordained him, but he says, "When they saw that the 
gospel was entrusted to me,” that is, that it was rightly 
commanded to me; not by Peter. For as | did not receive 
or learn the gospel from a man, neither did | receive from 
a man the command to preach it, but both the 
knowledge of the gospel and the command to preach it 
among the Gentiles | received directly from Christ, in all 
things just as Peter was given the gospel by God and 
commanded to preach it among the Jews. 

This passage clearly testifies that all the apostles had 
the same calling and command and the same gospel. 
Peter did not preach a different gospel than the others, 
nor did he command the ministry of the other apostles, 
but there was complete equality among them. For all 
were taught and called by GOD, that is, both the calling 
and the command of all the apostles were badly direct 
from GOD. So no apostle is greater than the other, and 
no person has any privilege. Therefore, it is an impudent 
lie that the pope boasts that Peter was the most 
distinguished among the apostles, and thus he wants to 
confirm his primacy 2c. 


V. 8. for he who with Petro was strong for the 
apostleship 2c. 


This is the refutation of another reason of the false 
apostles. What do the false apostles boast, he says, that 
Peter's gospel was powerful, that many were converted 
through him, that he performed many and great 
miracles, that he raised the dead, that his shadow 
healed the sick? | admit all this. But Peter has 


144 Ni-l. 1, 165-157. Explanation of Galatians 2, 8. 9. W. 


VIII, 1758-1761. 145 





received this power from heaven, God gave power to his 
voice so that many believed that many miracles were 
done through him. | have also had the same power, 
which | did not receive from Peter, but the same God 
and Spirit that was powerful in Peter has also been 
powerful in me. | have had the same grace, taught many, 
and done many miracles, even healing the sick with my 
shadow. And this is testified by Lucas in the Acts of the 
Apostles Cap. 19, 11. 12.: "And God worked no small 
deeds by the hands of Paul, so that they also from his 
skin held the sweatcloths and the boils over the sick, and 
the plagues departed from them, and the evil spirits were 
carried out from them." You can read more about this in 
the 13th, 16th, 20th and 28th chapters of Acts. 

In short, Paul does not want to be considered inferior 
to the other apostles in any way and has a godly and 
holy pride in this. Therefore Julianus and Porphyrius 
slander Paul without cause, saying that he is insolent 
against the head of the apostles. Paul was here 
ambitious and proud against Peter out of necessity, and 
indeed because of a necessity of God, because the zeal 
for God's honor forced him to show himself so proud. 
These slanderers did not see this, and therefore thought 
that this pride of his was a carnal one, as it is found today 
in the pope and his bishops. But this was not something 
that concerned Paul, but the faith. 

In matters of faith, however, we must not allow 
ourselves to be overcome, we must be unbending, quite 
stubborn, and, if we could, harder than a demon; but 
where love is concerned, we must be softer and more 
yielding than any reed or leaf, and willing to do anything. 
So here the dispute was not about the honor of Paul, but 
about the honor of God, about the word of God, about 
true worship, about religion and the righteousness of 
faith, so that all this would remain unharmed. 


V. 9. And knowing the grace that was given to me, 
Jacob and Cephas and John, who were esteemed 
pillars, gave it to me 





the right hand and became one with us, so that we 
preached among the Gentiles, but they among the 
circumcision. 1) 


That is, when they heard that | had received from God 
the calling and command to preach the gospel among 
the Gentiles, that God had done so many miracles 
through me, and that through my ministry so many 
Gentiles had come to the knowledge of Christ, that the 
Gentiles, without the law and circumcision, had received 
the Holy Spirit through the preaching of faith alone, they 
praised God for the grace that was given to me. Grace 
he calls all that he had received from God, that he had 
become an apostle from a persecutor and destroyer of 
the church, taught by Christ, richly gifted with spiritual 
gifts 2c. 

And by this account Paul indicates that Peter had 
given him the testimony that he was a true apostle, not 
taught and sent by him or by other apostles, but by God 
alone. And so he did not humbly acknowledge the 


authority and prestige (auctoritatem) of Paul and the 
gifts of the Spirit in him as divine things, but approved 
and confirmed me, not as a superior and author, but as 
a brother and a friend. The same thing did Jacobus and 
John. Therefore, those who are the pillars among the 
apostles stand on my side, not against me. 


They gave me sand Barnabas the right hand and 
became one with us (Dextras societatis). 


That is, [they gave me the right hand as a sign of] 
fellowship or ministerial fellowship; that is, they said, 
"We preach the gospel with you, dear Paul, in the same 
sense. So we are comrades in doctrine and have 
fellowship in the same, that is, we have the same 
doctrine, because we preach the same gospel, the same 
baptism, the same Christ, the same faith as you. 
Therefore, we cannot teach you anything, nor command 
you anything, since we are one with you in all things. For 
we do not teach anything

Other or better or higher 1) than you, but see in you the 
same gift that we have, only that you are commanded 
the gospel to the foreskin, but we to circumcision. But we 
here resolve that the foreskin and the circumcision shall 
not hinder our fellowship, since it is the same gospel that 
we both preach. 

95. This passage reminds us that it is the same 
gospel everywhere, for Gentiles, Jews, monks, laymen, 
young men, old men, men, women 2c. It does not look 
at persons, but is a common word and teaching for all 
men; whoever hears and believes this [teaching] will be 
saved, and it does not prevent him from being 
uncircumcised or circumcised. 

Up to this point, Paul has proved that he taught the 
gospel rightly and godly, not only with divine testimony, 
but also with human testimony, namely, that of the 
apostles. Therefore, he shows that everything the false 
apostles said to diminish his reputation was fabricated, 
and that the testimony of the apostles was on his side, 
not on the side of the false apostles. But because he 
alone tells this, he swears and calls God as a witness 
that what he said is true. 


V. 10. Only that we may remember the 
poor, which I have been diligent to do. 


97 A good shepherd, after preaching the gospel, 
must also see to it that the poor are not left unprovided 
for. For where the church is, there must necessarily be 
the poor, who alone are usually the true disciples of the 
gospel, as Christ says: "To the poor the gospel is 
preached. For the devil and the world persecute the 
church and plunge many into poverty, who are 
subsequently abandoned and neglected. 

Then the world not only sins in this, but also does not 
care to preserve the gospel, true godliness and right 
worship. No one wants to contribute or help 2c. that the 
servants of the church are fed and schools are 
established. For superstition and for sincerity, no one 
wants to contribute. 


1) ant kuMimiora is missing in the Erlanger. 





Everyone has gladly given with both hands to the 
support and preservation of false religious services. So 
many monasteries, so many cathedrals, so many 
bishoprics have been founded in the papacy, where 
nothing but godlessness reigns, and so much income 
has been decreed to maintain them. 

Now it is burdensome for a city to feed one or two 
ministers of the Gospel, while in former times, when the 
godless being ruled, it fed without difficulty several 
monasteries, and missal monks without number, not to 
mention mendicant monks, stationers 2) 2c. In short, true 
religion always suffers lack, and Christ complains that he 
is hungry, thirsty, a guest, naked, sick 2c., whereas the 
godless being is in full bloom and has abundance of all 
goods. Therefore, a right bishop must also care for the 
poor, which Paul did, as he confesses here. 


V. ii. But when Peter came to Antioch, I 
resisted him under my eyes, because a 
complaint had come against him. 


Paul continues his refutation and says that he not 
only has the testimony of Peter and the other apostles in 
Jerusalem for himself, but that he also resisted Peter in 
the presence of the church in Antioch. Here he tells an 
event that did not happen in the corner, but in the 
presence of the church. 

This wonderful story has given many people cause 
for blasphemy, such as Porphyrius, Celsus, Julianus and 
others, who accuse Paul of arrogance, because he has 
attacked the highest of the apostles in the face of the 
church, thereby exceeding the limits of Christian 
modesty and humility. But it is not surprising that those 
think and speak such things who do not recognize the 
purpose of Paul's statement.

part of the book, the second part of the book, and the

The main thing is not how to earn one's living, but the 
main article of Christian doctrine. Whoever recognizes 
how great the benefit and the majesty of this is, puts 
everything else aside and regards it as nothing. For what 
is Peter? what is Paul? what is an angel from heaven? 
what is all creation compared to the article of 
justification? For if we know him, we walk in the brightest 
light; if we do not understand him, we are in the deepest 
darkness 2c. Therefore, if you see that one wants to 
make him waver or endanger him, do not be afraid to 
resist Peter, yes, even an angel from heaven, because 
he cannot be lifted high enough. 

Porphyrius and others, on the other hand, look at the 
high dignity of Peter, admire his person, and forget the 
sublimity of this article. Paul does the opposite; he does 
not attack Peter's person vehemently, but treats him with 
great reverence. But because he sees that for the sake 
of Peter's dignity the majesty of the article of justification 
is endangered, he does not take his dignity into 
consideration in order to preserve and defend only this 
article. So do we, for it is written [Matth. 11, 37. ff.]: 
"Whoever loves father or mother, yes, even his life 2c. 
more than me, is not worthy of me." 

104 Therefore, when it comes to defending the truth 
of the gospel, we are not ashamed that the hypocrites 
accuse us of being proud and stiff-necked, wanting only 
to be wise, to hear no one, to yield to no one. Here it is 
extremely necessary that we be unbending and 
stubborn, because the cause for which we fall short 
against a person, that is, for which we trample on the 


great reputation (Majestatem) of a person or of the 
world, is such a great one that the offenses which the 
world considers the greatest become and are the 
highest virtues before God. 

We do well to honor our parents, to show honor to 
the authorities, to show reverence to Peter and other 
ministers of the Word. But now we do not have to deal 
with things that would harm Peter, the parents, the 
emperor, the world or any creature. 





but with the cause of God. Then | do right that | do not 
give way to the parents, the emperor or also an angel 
from heaven 2c. Cause: Hold God and the creatures 
against each other. What are all creatures as a whole 
against God? A droplet against the sea. Why then should 
| so admire Peter, who is a little drop, that | forsake God, 
who is the sea? Therefore, let the drop give way to the 
sea, let Peter give way to God. 

| say this so that one may pay careful attention to the 
matter with which Paul has to deal. But he is dealing with 
the word of God, which no one can elevate high enough. 
Augustine judges this matter of Paul better than Jerome, 
who only looks at the dignity and reputation of Peter and 
therefore concludes thus: Peter was the highest apostle, 
therefore he could not be rebuked by Paul, or if he 
rebuked him, he did it only in pretense. 

Thus, he ascribes a hypocritical behavior to Paul, 
that he had pretended for Peter's sake that he was 
blameworthy, so that he could carry out his apostleship 
more effectively and protect his Gentiles. On the other 
hand, he excuses Peter in all respects and credits him 
with remaining truthful. This is a very clumsy reversal of 
the text, which clearly expresses that Peter was criminal 
and had strayed from the truth, as well as that other Jews 
had been hypocritical with him, so that Barnabas had 
also been seduced by them into the same hypocrisy. 
Jerome does not see these clear words, but sticks to this 
one: Peter was an apostle, therefore blameless, and 
could not sin. Augustine rightly opposes this statement. 
He says: "It must not be tolerated that a hypocritical 
behavior is imposed on Paul, because he swears with an 
oath that he is telling the truth. 

For this reason, Jerome and Erasmus do injustice to 
Paul, who explain the word "under eyes" as "as it could 
be seen," that is, not from the heart, but only in 
appearance. Paul did not say this out of conviction, but 


in hypocritical complacency (Simulatione officiosa). 


150 Lri. 6ai. 1, 161-163. Interpretations on the epist 


e to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1772-1775. 151 





Peter resisted, so as not to give the Gentiles an upset 
[which would have happened] if he had kept completely 
silent. 

But "under eyes" means: in his presence. For eye to 
eye (in os) he resisted Peter, not in the corner, but when 
Peter was present and the whole church was there. And 
this word "in sight" he puts quite emphatically against the 
poisonous vipers, Satan's apostles, who disparage 
people behind their backs, in whose presence they do 
not even dare to open their mouths, as the false apostles 
did, whom he also heckles here in a hidden way, since 
they did not dare to speak disparagingly of him in his 
presence, but did so behind his back. In this way, he 
says, | did not belittle Peter, but resisted him freely and 
openly, not out of hypocrisy, ambition, not out of any 


carnal irritation or bitterness (morbo animi), but 
because complaint had come upon him 2c. 

Here let others debate whether an apostle can sin. 
We should not try to make Peter's sin smaller than it is. 
For even the prophets sometimes err and deceive 
themselves. Nathan said out of his own spirit to David 
that he should build the house of the LORD [2 Sam. 7:3]. 
This saying of the prophet was soon corrected by a 
divine revelation, namely that not David, who was a man 
of war and had shed much blood, should build a house 
for the Lord, but his son Solomon [1 Chron. 23, 8. ff]. 
The apostles also erred in this way. They dreamed that 
the kingdom of Christ would be a fleshly one, Apost. 1:6: 
"Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" 
and Peter would not have gone to Cornelius, even 
though he had heard from Christ: "Go into all the world" 
2c., if he had not been admonished to do so by the vision 
2c. But here in this matter he not only erred, but fell into 
a serious case and committed a great sin. And if Paul 
had not resisted him, all who had believed from among 
the Gentiles would have been forced to receive 
circumcision and keep the law, and the believing Jews 
would have been affected in their opinion. 


The people had been convinced that the observance of 
these things was necessary for salvation, and in this way 
they had again accepted the law instead of the gospel, 
Moses instead of Christ. And Peter would have given 
rise to this exceedingly great sin and unspeakable harm 
by his hypocrisy. Therefore, we must not attribute such 
great perfection to the saints as if they could not sin. 

In the Acts of the Apostles, Cap. 15, 39, Lucas reports 
that between Paul and Barnabas, who were both set 
apart for the ministry of the gospel among the Gentiles 
and had already traveled through many countries and 
preached the gospel to them, such a_ violent 
disagreement arose that they departed from each other. 
Here either Paul or Barnabas went too far, and it must 
have been an exceedingly violent discord, because it 
separated these most closely united comrades from one 
another, as the text in the Acts of the Apostles testifies. 
Such examples are written for our comfort, because it is 
very comforting to us to hear that even the saints who 
had the Spirit of God sinned. This consolation is 
snatched from us by those who say that the saints 
cannot sin. 

Samson, David and other famous people who were 
full of the Holy Spirit fell into great sins. Job and Jeremiah 
curse the day of their birth; Elijah and Jonah ask God to 
let them die because they are tired of life. Such errors 
and sins of the saints the holy scripture holds up for the 
comfort of the afflicted and despairing, but for the horror 
of the arrogant. For no one has ever fallen so hard that 
he could not get up again. On the other hand, no one has 
gained such a firm foothold that he could not fall. If Peter 
fell, so can | fall; if he got up again, so can | get up again. 

114 And such examples should be highly esteemed 
by pusillanimous and frightened consciences, that they 
may the better understand what they pray when they 
say, "Forgive us our trespasses," and, "I believe the 
forgiveness of sins." The same faith and the same prayer 
the apostles and all the saints have with 





152 Oai. 1, 163-166. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 2, 1k. k2. W. VIII, 1775-1779. 


15Z 





We have the same goods as they have, the same Christ, 
the same death, the same word, the same forgiveness 
of sins. They also had need of all these things and were 
sanctified and saved in the same way as we are. 

(115) This | say against the mad boasts and 
intemperate exaltations with which the foolish school 


theologians (sophistae) and the monks have singled out 
the saints. Likewise, they have said that the Church is so 
holy that it is entirely without sin. It is true that the church 
is holy, as our faith confesses: "I believe a holy church" 
2c., and yet it has sin. Therefore she believes 
forgiveness of sins and prays, "Forgive us our 
trespasses." It is not for this reason that she is called 
holy, that she is holy by her nature (form aliter), as a wall 
is called white, from the whiteness clinging to it. This 
clinging holiness is not sufficient, but Christ is its perfect 
and entire holiness; where clinging holiness is not 
sufficient, Christ is [1 Cor. 1:30]. 


V.12. For before some of Jacob's people came, he 
ate with the Gentiles. 


The Gentiles who were converted to the faith ate food 
that was forbidden by the Law. Peter ate the same food 
with the converted Gentiles as long as he was alone with 
them, and drank forbidden wine, knowing that he was 
doing right. Therefore he confidently transgressed the 
law with the Gentiles. Paul also confesses that he did this 
when he says, 1 Cor. 9:20, 21, that he became a Jew to 
the Jews, and without law to those who were without law 
2c., that is, he ate and drank with the Gentiles in a 
Gentile way and kept no law at all. With the Jews, 
according to the law, he abstained from all that was 
forbidden in the law, for he strove to serve and please 
all, to win all. Therefore Peter did not sin in this, but did 
well, knowing that he was free to do so. And by this 
transgression of the law, he also showed that the law 
was not necessary for righteousness, and freed the 
Gentiles from observing the law. For it stood to the 





If Peter was free to transgress the law in one piece, he 
was free to transgress it in all pieces. Paul did not punish 
Peter for this transgression of the law, but for hypocrisy, 
as follows: 


But when they came, he withdrew and separated 
himself, because he feared those of the circumcision. 


117 There you see Peter's sin, which Paul clearly 
describes. He complains about him, not because of 
malice or ignorance, but because of his hypocrisy and 
weakness, namely, that he abstained from common 
food, which was forbidden in the Law, fearing that the 
Jews, who had come from James, would take offense at 
it. And so he showed more consideration for his Jews 
than for the Gentiles, and thereby gave cause for 
Christian freedom and the truth of the gospel to be 
endangered. For by withdrawing and separating himself 
completely, abstaining from the food forbidden by the 
law, which he had eaten before, he put a sting 


(scrupulum) in the conscience of the believers, so that 
they concluded from this behavior of his: Peter abstains 
from the foods forbidden in the law, so everyone who 
eats what is forbidden in the law sins and transgresses 
the law; but he who abstains fulfills the law and is 
righteous; otherwise he would not abstain. But because 
he abstains and deliberately avoids the food he ate 
before, this is a sure sign that those who eat sin against 
the law, but that those who abstain from the food 
forbidden by the law fulfill the law and _ attain 
righteousness. 

This is the article that is dealt with here. Jerome did 
not recognize this; he only looked at what happened, not 
what the consequences of what happened would be 


(finem facti). What Peter did was not evil in itself, 
because eating and drinking, or not eating and drinking, 
is nothing. But that which is attached to it: If you eat, you 
sin; if you abstain, you are righteous; this is evil. 
Likewise, circumcision in itself is something good, but 
that is evil if 


154 Art. <4i "i. 1, 163-168. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1779-1782. 


155 





is hung on it: Unless you are circumcised according to 
the law of Moses, you cannot be saved. Likewise, it is not 
evil to eat such food as is forbidden in the Law, but it was 
evil for Peter to abstain and separate himself, because 
this conclusion is drawn from it: Peter abstains from the 
foods that are forbidden in the law, so unless you also 
abstain from them, you cannot be saved. Paul could not 
ignore this and remain silent because the truth of the 
gospel would be endangered; so that it would remain 
unharmed, he resisted Peter in plain sight. 

(119) A distinction must be made here, because one 
can abstain from food in two ways. First, to serve the 
brother with love alone in mind. There is no danger, but 
it is good to serve the weak brother in this way. This is 
what Paul himself did and taught, 1 Cor. 9, 19. ff. 

120 Secondly, that he who abstains from food 
becomes righteous and blessed, and he who does not 
abstain from it sins and is condemned. Here love is to be 
condemned, and all its ministrations and compliances. 
For to abstain from food in this way is to deny Christ, to 
trample His blood underfoot, to blaspheme the Holy 
Spirit, yes, God and all that is God. Therefore, if one of 
the two must be lost, rather let a friend go and lose the 
brother, who is a man, rather than the Father, who is 
God. For if the father, who is GOD, is lost, the brother, 
who is aman, will not remain long. 

Since Jerome did not recognize this, he could not 
understand this passage or the entire Brie. He thinks that 
Paul punished Peter only for appearances. Therefore, he 
belittles Peter's sin and excuses it, saying that it was 
done out of ignorance. But he sinned out of hypocrisy, 
and by doing so he would have again established the law 
as necessary, and would have forced Gentiles and Jews 
to depart from the truth of the gospel, and would have 
given them a very good reason to leave Christ, to deny 
grace, and to become a Christian. 





Judaism and to bear all the burdens of the law, if Paul 
had not punished him and thereby brought Jews and 
Gentiles back to freedom in Christ and the truth of the 
gospel, who had been angered by Peter's example. 

Therefore, if someone were to judge Peter's sin 
harshly and make it great, it would indeed be a very great 
sin, but only one that, prompted by circumstances, 
happened occasionally and out of fear, and was not 
committed out of malice or ignorance. It is so easy for the 
fall or error of a single person to bring tremendous harm 
if it is not resisted. Therefore, the article of justification is 
not to be trifled with, and it is not in vain that we inculcate 
and press it so diligently. 

And it is very surprising that Peter, such a great 
apostle, did this, since he had previously obtained at the 
Council of Jerusalem almost solely through his 
statement that believers attain righteousness through 
faith alone, without the law. The very same one who had 
been the author of the truth and freedom of the gospel 
comes to ruin by this strange occasion and accident, that 
he abstains from the foods that were forbidden in the law, 
and becomes the author of such a great offense and sins 
against his own saying. 

Therefore, let him who stands take care that he does 
not fall Cor. 10:12J. No one believes how dangerous 
statutes and ceremonies are, which we cannot do 
without. What is more necessary in the whole world than 
the law and its works 2c.? And yet there is always the 
danger that one might thereby come to deny Christ. For 
often a trust in works grows out of the law. But where this 
is, there can be no confidence in Christ. 

(125) So it is easy to come to denying and losing 
Christ, as we see in Peter (who knew the article of 
justification better than we do), how easily 1) by his 
deeds and example he very soon lost faith in Christ.

to such great harm that all the Gentiles would have fallen 
away from the preaching of Paul, would have lost the 
gospel and Christ, 2c. under a pretense of holiness. For 
they could have said: Paul, thou hast hitherto taught that 
we are justified by grace alone without the law. But now 
you see that Peter does the opposite. For he abstains 
from the forbidden foods of the law, and by this he 
shows by his own example that we cannot be saved if 
we do not accept circumcision and keep the law 2c. 


V.13. And the other Jews hypocritized with him, 
so that Barnabas also was deceived into hypocrisy 
with them. 


Here you see clearly that Paul blames Peter for 
hypocrisy. Jerome, on the other hand, puts it on Paul. If 
Peter was hypocritical, he certainly knew what was the 
truth and what was not the truth. For he that hypocrites 
does not sin through ignorance, but knowingly deceives 
men by pretending something other than what is the 
truth. And others, he says, fell in with Peter's hypocrisy, 
so that Barnabas also, who had been Paul's companion 
and had been preaching with him among the Gentiles 
for a long time the faith in Christ without the law, was 
deceived into the same hypocrisy. Here, then, you have 
a clear description of Peter's sin, namely, that it was 
hypocrisy that would have given rise to the disturbance 
of the gospel accepted [by the Gentiles] if Paul had not 
stood against Peter. 

It is an admirable thing that God preserved the young 
church and even the gospel at that time through one 
person. Paul alone stands, for he has lost his comrade 
Barnabas; Peter he has against him. So sometimes one 
person in a concilium can do more than the whole 
concilium. The papists themselves write this and cite 
Paphnutius as an example, who resisted the entire 
Council of Nicaea, which was the best after the Apostles' 
Council in Jerusalem, and retained the upper hand. 





‘| say this so that we may learn the article of 
justification with the utmost diligence, and distinguish the 
gospel from the law in the purest way, and in this matter 
do nothing at all hypocritical, yielding to no one even a 
hair's breadth, if we wish otherwise to keep the truth of 
the gospel and the faith pure and unharmed, which, as | 
have said, are very easily violated. Therefore, let reason, 
the enemy of faith, remain far away, which in the 
temptations of sin and death does not rely on the 
righteousness of faith, because it does not know it at all, 
but on its own righteousness or at most on the 
righteousness of the law. But as soon as the law and 
reason are combined with each other, the virginity of 
faith is immediately gone. Nothing is stronger and more 
hostile to faith than the law and reason, and these two 
cannot be overcome without great effort and exertion, 
and yet must be overcome if one wants to be blessed 
otherwise. 

Therefore, if your conscience is troubled by the law 
and wrestles with the judgment of God, consult neither 
reason nor the law, but rely solely on grace and the word 
of comfort. Do not think otherwise than if you had never 
heard of the law of God, but go into the darkness 
[Exodus 20:21], where neither the law nor reason 
shines, but only the dark word of faith, which [faith] 
surely trusts to be saved apart from and above the law, 
in Christ. 

Thus the gospel leads us beyond the light of law and 
reason into the darkness of faith, where law and reason 
have nothing to do. The law must also be heard, but in 
its place and time. Since Moses is on the mountain, 
where he is face to face with

of the Table Talks, this section is omitted.

God speaks, he does not have the law, he does not give 
and administer it; but after he came down from the 
mountain, he is a lawgiver and governs the people with 
the law. So the conscience should be free from the law, 
but the body should obey the law. 

From this it is quite clear that Paul did not punish 
Peter for a very minor matter, but for the main article of 
Christian doctrine, which Peter almost disturbed 
(parabat ruinam) by his hypocrisy. For Barnabas and 
the other Jews were hypocritical with him, all of whom 
sinned, not out of ignorance or malice, but out of fear of 
the Jews, which had darkened their hearts so that they 
did not realize that they were sinning. It is truly a 
marvelous thing that such great men, Peter, Barnabas, 
and others, should so quickly and easily fall into the very 
work they knew and had previously taught to be right. 

That is why D. Staupitz rightly warned that it is very 
dangerous to rely on our powers, no matter how holy and 
learned we may be, no matter how well we may have 
recognized and grasped something. For precisely in 
what we know best, we can still fall and err, not only to 
our own detriment, but also to the detriment of others. 
Therefore, let us devote ourselves to the study of the 
Scriptures with the greatest diligence and the deepest 
humility, and let us pray earnestly, lest we lose the truth 
of the Gospel. 

So we are nothing with all our gifts, however great 
they may be, if God is not with us. If He withdraws His 
hand from us, our wisdom, our knowledge 2c. is nothing. 
If he does not constantly sustain us, then the highest 
knowledge is of no use to us, yes, even if we attained the 
highest degree of perfection in theology. For in the hour 
of trial it can soon happen that all comforting words are 
torn from our eyes by the wiles of the devil, and only the 
threatening words come to our mind and crush us. 
Therefore, we should learn that when God withdraws His 
hand from us, we may fall and be overthrown 
exceedingly easily. Therefore, let no one be proud 


And boast not of his righteousness, wisdom, and gifts, 
but humble himself, praying with the apostles [Luc. 
17:5.], "Lord, strengthen us in the faith." 


V.14. But when I saw that they did not walk 
rightly according to the truth of the gospel. 


Here, the greatest men and pillars of the church are 
held up to us as a strange example. Paul alone has open 
eyes here and sees the sin of Peter, Barnabas and the 
other Jews who were hypocrites together with Peter. On 
the other hand, they themselves do not see their sin, yes, 
they believe that they do right and serve the weak Jews 
through love. Therefore, it was of utmost necessity that 
Paul could not overlook their sin, but had to punish it. 
Therefore, he publicly accused Peter, Barnabas and 
others that they did not walk correctly according to the 
truth of the gospel, that is, that they had deviated from 
the truth of the gospel. 

Now it is a great thing that Peter is accused by Paul 
as one who has fallen and departed from the truth of the 
gospel. He could not have been punished more severely. 
And yet he bears this patiently, and no doubt also 
accepted it with great gratitude. 

| have noted above (34 ff.) that many have the 
gospel, but not the truth of the gospel. Thus Paul says 
here that Peter, Barnabas and the other Jews do not 
walk correctly according to the truth of the gospel, that 
is, they have the gospel, but they do not walk correctly 
according to it. For as much as they preached the 
gospel, yet by their hypocrisy, which could not stand with 
the truth of the gospel, they set up the law; but he that 
setteth up the law abolisheth the gospel, and bringeth it 
to nought. 

Therefore, whoever knows how to distinguish the 
gospel from the law, thank God and know that he is a 
theologian. Admittedly, | do not yet understand this in the 
challenge as | should. But both are to be

distinguish that you place the gospel in heaven, the law 
on earth, that you call the righteousness of the gospel 
heavenly and divine, the righteousness of the law earthly 
and human, and that you distinguish the righteousness 
of the gospel from the righteousness of the law as 
carefully as God distinguished heaven from earth, light 
from darkness, day from night. The one shall be light and 
day, the other darkness and night, and would God that 
we could still further separate them. 

Therefore, when one acts by faith or by conscience, 
the law should be completely excluded and remain on 
earth; but when one acts by works, let the lamp of works 
or of the righteousness of the law be lit by night. Thus 
the sun and the immense light of the gospel and grace 
shall shine by day, but the lamp of the law by night. 
Therefore a conscience that is frightened by the feeling 
of its sin should think: Now you have to work on earth, 
there the donkey should work, serve and carry the 
burden that is laid on it, that is, the body with its members 
should be subject to the law. But when you ascend to 
heaven, leave the donkey with its burden on earth. For 
the conscience has nothing to do with the law, with works 
and with earthly righteousness. So the donkey stays in 
the valley, but the conscience climbs the mountain with 
Isaac and knows nothing about the law and works, but 
has only the forgiveness of sins in mind, and nothing but 
the righteousness that has been held out to us and given 
to us in Christ. 

In the worldly regime, however, obedience to the law 
is to be demanded most strictly. There one should know 
nothing of the gospel, of conscience, of grace, of 
forgiveness of sins, of heavenly righteousness, of Christ, 
but only of Moses, of the law and works. If this distinction 
is carefully observed, neither of them comes out of its 
bounds, but the law will remain out of heaven, that is, out 
of the heart or conscience. On the other hand, the 
evangelical freedom will remain from the earth, the 





that is, it will remain outside the body and its members. 
Therefore, as soon as the law and sin come into heaven, 
that is, into the conscience, they are to be thrown out 
immediately, because the conscience, which is 
frightened by the fear of the wrath and judgment of God, 
should know nothing of the law and sin, but only of 
Christ. And again, when grace, liberty 2c. comes on 
earth, that is, into the body, one should say: You do not 
have to move in the stable and filth of the bodily life, but 
belong up to heaven 2c. 

This difference between the law and the gospel was 
blurred by Peter's hypocritical behavior and led the 
believers to believe that they had to be justified by the 
gospel and the law at the same time. Paul could not 
tolerate this, so he punished Peter, not to disgrace him, 
but to separate these two things again, namely, that the 
law justified on earth, but the gospel justified in heaven. 

The pope has not only mixed the law with the gospel, 
but has made of the gospel all laws, and only ceremonial 
laws, and has thrown the secular and the ecclesiastical 
into confusion, which is a truly satanic and hellish 
confusion. 

This doctrine of the difference between the Law and 
the Gospel must be known, because it contains the sum 
of the whole Christian doctrine. Therefore, let every one 
who strives for godliness strive with the greatest care to 
learn the distinction, not only in words, but also in truth 


(affectu) and in experience, that is, in the heart and 
conscience. Otherwise, as far as words are concerned, 
this distinction is easy. But in temptation you will realize 
that the gospel is a rare guest in the conscience, while 
the law is a daily housemate. For reason by nature has 
the knowledge of the law. 

143 Therefore, when the conscience is frightened by 
the sin indicated by the law, the conscience is frightened 
by the sin indicated by the law.

and made great, then you shall say: There is a time to 
die, there is a time to live, there is a time to hear the law, 
there is a time not to be concerned about the law, there 
is a time to hear the gospel, there is a time not to know 
the gospel. Now roll over the law, and let the gospel 
come to you, for now is not the time to hear the law, but 
the gospel. But you have done no good, rather you have 
sinned grievously. | admit that, but | have forgiveness of 
sins through Christ, for whose sake all my sins are 
forgiven. But if the conscience is not in battle, and 
outward works of office must be performed, where thou 
art a minister of the word, a person in authority, a 
husband, a teacher, a disciple 2c. then it is not time to 
hear the gospel, but the law, thou shalt perform thy 
profession 2c. 


I said to Petro publicly in front of everyone, "If 
you, who are a Jew, live as a Gentile and not as a Jew, 
why do you force the Gentiles to live as Jews? 


(144) That is, you are a Jew who is obligated to live 
according to the Jewish law, that is, to abstain from the 
foods forbidden in the law, and yet you, who are a Jew, 
live paganly, that is, you act freely against the law, you 
transgress it and trample it underfoot. For you eat (and 
in this you do right) common or unclean food, like a 
Gentile who is free from the law. But precisely because 
you have allowed yourself to be intimidated by the 
presence of the brothers from the Jews who have 
converted, and now abstain from the foods that are 
forbidden in the law, and keep the law, you force the 
Gentiles to live Jewishly, that is, to keep the law as 
necessary. For by this example of yours, that you abstain 
from unclean foods, you give the Gentiles cause to think 
thus: Peter now avoids the foods of the Gentiles, which 
he ate before, so we must also avoid them and live 
according to the Jewish way, otherwise we will not be 
justified nor saved. So you see that Paul is not punishing 
Peter for his ignorance, because he knew that he was 
free to eat any food with the Gentiles, but for his 
hypocrisy, by which he forced the Gentiles to live 
Jewishly. 





Here again | remind you that it is not evil in itself to 
live according to the Jewish way, for it is a matter of no 
concern whether you eat pork or other meat. But if you 
live Jewishly in such a way that you would abstain from 
certain foods for the sake of conscience, that is denying 
Christ and disturbing the gospel. Therefore Paul, when 
he saw that Peter's conduct would lead to this, objected 
and said to him, "You know that the observance of the 
law is not necessary for righteousness, but that it is given 
to us through Christ alone, and therefore you do not keep 
the law, but transgress it and eat all kinds of food. 
Nevertheless, by your example you force the Gentiles to 
fall away from Christ to the law, because you give them 
reason to think that faith alone does not justify, but at the 
same time the law and works are required, and Peter 
shows this by his example; therefore, besides faith in 
Christ, the observance of the law is equally necessary if 
one wants to be justified. 

Therefore, Peter's behavior not only violated the 
purity of doctrine, but also the truth of faith and Christian 
righteousness. For the Gentiles assumed that the law 
was necessary for righteousness. If this error persists, 
Christ is of no use. 

147 From this it is completely clear what the 
disagreement and the dispute between Paul and Peter 
was about. Paul acts in earnest and from a sincere heart, 
he does not expose himself as if he were punishing him. 
But with Peter, as the text clearly says, there is 
hypocrisy, which Paul punishes in him. Therefore, there 
is no hypocrisy in Paul, but a pure and wholly Christian 
earnestness and a holy pride, which would have been 
blameworthy if Peter had committed any minor sin and 
had not sinned against the main article of Christian 
doctrine. But because the truth of the gospel suffers 
through Peter's guilt, Paul will not and cannot leave it 
unprotected. Therefore, in order to keep it unharmed, he 
does not care about Peter; Barnabas and all the others 
are nothing to him. 


164 Li-|. Oai. 1, 176-178. Explanation of Galatians 2, 14. W. 


Therefore Porphyrius and Julianus do Paul an 
injustice, who blaspheme that he punished Peter only out 
of presumption. Yes, even reason itself must admit, if it 
recognizes otherwise what the matter of which Paul is 
concerned has in view, that it is better that no 
consideration be given to Peter than that the divine 
majesty should give way or the faith be endangered. For 
here it is a question of either Peter must be severely 
punished or Christ must be removed from the remedy. 
Here, if it could not be otherwise, Peter would rather 
perish and go to hell than Christ be lost. Porphyrius and 
all must agree with this judgment, and everyone must 
confess that Paul acted rightly and godly in this case. 

If the dispute had been about something in the 
middle (like the disagreement between Paul and 
Barnabas Apost. 15, 39. is a joke compared to this matter 
and something quite insignificant), then Paul could have 
given way; but in this exceedingly great matter he could 
not give way at all. 

According to the example of Paul, every Christian 
should be proud. Love should tolerate everything, believe 
and hope (1 Cor. 13, 7.), faith, on the other hand, should 
rule, take a commanding position, present itself as victor 


(triumphet) and give way to no one, but everything 
should be submissive to it and give way, people of low 


and high rank (plebes, populi), kings and judges on 
earth, as the 2nd Psalm, v. 10-12, says: "Let yourselves 
therefore be instructed, you kings, and let yourselves be 
chastened, you judges on earth. Serve the LORD with 
fear 2c., or ye shall perish in the way." Therefore, faith 
and love are completely opposed to each other in their 
activity, service and nature. 

151 Therefore all power lies in the word: "You compel 
the Gentiles to live Jewishly", that is, you compel them to 
fall away from grace and faith to the law and works, and 
to deny Christ, as if he had suffered and died in vain 2c. 
This word: "You compel" includes all the dangers and 
sins of which Paul speaks in this passage. 





VIII, 1795-1798. 165 
The whole letter speaks so urgently, and which he 
presents as so great. For if this compulsion is 
maintained, or if it is taught that the observance of the 
law is necessary, then faith must necessarily be lost; but 
if it is lost and disturbed, then all the promises of God 
are in vain, all the gifts of the Holy Spirit are trampled 
underfoot, and all men must perish and be condemned. 
Paul attributes many such characteristics to the 
righteousness of the law throughout this letter. 

'Since it is so dangerous to deal with the law, and 
since this fall happens so easily and is so violent, as if 
one were falling from the highest heaven into hell, let 
every Christian learn to distinguish these two things 
most carefully. Let the law rule over the body and its 
members, but not over the conscience. For this queen 
and bride is not to be defiled by the law, but to remain 
undefiled to the one and only bridegroom Christ, as Paul 
says elsewhere [2 Cor. 11:2]: "| have entrusted you to 
one man" 2c. 

Therefore, it [the conscience] should not have its 
bridal bed down in the valley, but up on the mountain, 
where Christ alone lies and reigns, who neither terrifies 
nor crushes sinners, but comforts them, forgives their 
sins and makes them blessed. Therefore, a troubled 
conscience should think nothing, know nothing, hold 
nothing against the wrath and judgment of God but the 
word of Christ, which is a word of grace, forgiveness of 
sins, blessedness and eternal life. But to carry this out 
is laborious and exceedingly difficult. For reason and 
human nature do not remain firmly in the arms of Christ, 
but fall again and again on the thoughts of the law and 
of sin, and thus always seek to be free according to the 
flesh, but a handmaid and prisoner according to the 
conscience.

He put the first article of justification into a short form 
(summa) with these words: "So you who are a Jew" 2c. 
up to the passage: "For by the works of the law" 2c. 
where he addresses his speech again to the Galatians. 
But he said these words to Peter, not to instruct him, but 
to exhort him to constancy in the presence of the whole 
church, which heard such things. He now says to Peter: 


v. 15. We are Jews by nature, not sinners 
from among the Gentiles. 


That is, we are Jews by nature who are born with the 
righteousness of the Law, of Moses and of circumcision, 
and as soon as we are born, we bring the Law with us. 
Not at our pleasure, like the Gentiles, but by nature we 
have the righteousness of the law, as Paul says above 
in the first chapter, v. 14: "I zeal for the fatherly law" 2c. 
Therefore, when we are compared to the Gentiles, we 
are not sinners without law and works, like the Gentiles, 
but we are born and raised as Jews and righteous. Our 
righteousness has its beginning immediately at the 
Goburt, for Jewishness is innate in us. For God 
commanded Abraham in Genesis 17:12 that every child 
should be circumcised on the eighth day 2c. This law of 
circumcision, which the fathers received, Moses 
confirmed afterwards. So it is a great thing that we are 
Jews by nature, but even though we have this 
advantage, that we are righteous by nature and are born 
into the law and its works, and are not sinners like the 
Gentiles, we are still not righteous before God. 

Therefore, even if you were to introduce me to the 
best Jew, who was born righteous and kept the law 
perfectly from birth, he would still not be righteous before 
God. We are circumcised, but because of circumcision 
we are not justified, for it is only a seal of righteousness, 
Rom. 4, 11. and even the children who were circumcised 
in the faith of Abraham were not blessed because of 
their circumcision, but because of their faith. May 


Even if we are born as Jews and are still so holy, even if 
we can boast so much against the Gentiles that we have 
the justification of the law, the service of God, the 
promises, the fathers, which is truly a mighty glory, we 
are still not righteous before God, nor better than the 
Gentiles. 

157 From this it is quite clear that Paul is not talking 


about external customs (ceremoniis), that they are 
deadly after Christ has appeared, as Origen and Jerome 
think, but he is talking about an extremely great and 
serious matter, namely the birth of the Jews. He says 
that they are not righteous, although they are born holy, 
are circumcised, keep the law, the filiation, the honor, 
the testaments, the fathers, the worship, God, Christ, the 
promises, live in them and boast of them, as they say 
Joh. 8, 33: "We are Abraham's seed"; likewise, v. 41: 
"We have one Father, God", and Rom. 2, 17: "Behold, 
you are called a Jew" 2c. 

And so Peter, Paul and the other apostles were 
children of God, righteous according to the Law, yes, 
apostles of Christ, but still they were not righteous before 
God. Therefore, even though you would put all this 
together as a bundle, the law, the works and the 
righteousness of the law, the circumcision, the adoption, 
the testaments, the promises, the apostleship 2c., you 
still do not attain Christian righteousness, because all 
this is not faith in Christ, which, as follows in the text, 
alone justifies, not the law 2c. 

159 Not that the law is evil or condemned; for the law, 
circumcision, worship 2c. are not condemned for the 
sake of it, because they do not justify, but Paul denies 
them justification for the sake of it [i.e., because they do 
not justify], because the false apostles claimed that 
through these things without faith, only if they performed 
the work (ex opere operato), men would be justified and 
saved. Paul could not tolerate this. For if faith ceases, alll 
things are unto death, the law, circumcision, the 
adoption, the temple, the worship, the promises, yea, 


168 Li-I. OA. 1, 180-183. Explanation of Galatians 2, 15. 16. W. VIII, 1801-1804. 


169 





God and Christ themselves are of no use without faith. 
Paul therefore speaks flatly and generally against 
everything that is against faith, not only attacking the 
ceremonies. 


V.16. But because we know that man is 
not justified by the works of the law, but 
by faith in Jesus Christ. 


160 The word "work of the law" includes a great deal 
in itself and has a very great emphasis. | note this 


because of the sure and idle sophistas and monks who 
darken and corrupt such words in Paul's writings, 
indeed, his whole trade of justification, by their foolish 


and ungodly interpretations (glossis), which they 
themselves do not even understand. So take "the work 
of the law" simply in contrast to grace. Everything that is 
not grace is law, whether it be a judicial law, or a 
ceremonial law, or even the holy ten commandments. 
Therefore, even if you do a work of the law according to 
this commandment [Matth. 12, 37.]: "You shall love God, 
your Lord, with all your heart" 2c. (not to mention that no 
man has done or can do this), you will not be justified 
before God by it, for no man is justified by the works of 
the law. But we will speak of this more fully later. 

161 In Paul, then, "the work of the law" means any 
work of the whole law, whether of the ceremonial law or 
of the ten commandments. But if a work of the ten 
commandments cannot justify it, circumcision can much 
less, which is a work of the ceremonial law. 

162 Therefore, when Paul says, as he often does, 
"By the law" or "by the works of the law (both of which 
are synonymous in Paul) no man is justified," he is 
speaking of the whole law, placing the righteousness of 
faith in opposition to the righteousness of the whole law; 
the latter can be brought about from the law either by 
divine power or by human power, for the sake of the 
latter,

section is omitted. 





he says, no man is declared righteous before God. But 
the righteousness of faith is imputed to us by God, 
without merit, out of mercy, for the sake of Christ. 
Therefore he said emphatically and with a certain 
vehemence, "By the works of the law." 2) For there is no 
doubt that since the law is holy, just and good, the works 
of the law are also holy, just and good, and yet man is 
not justified before God by them. 

Therefore, the opinion of Jerome and others must be 
rejected, who dream that Paul is not speaking of the 
works prescribed in the Ten Commandments, but of 
works according to the ceremonial law. Nevertheless, 
they must confess that the ceremonial law was also good 
and holy. For the circumcision and other laws of the 
customs in the temple 2c. were just and holy, and just as 
much commanded and decreed by God Himself as the 
moral laws. Here they say: But after Christ they were 
fatal. They invent this out of their heads. Then Paul does 
not speak of the Gentiles, to whom the ceremonies would 
bring death, but of the Jews, for whom they were good; 
Paul himself also kept them. So they could not justify 
them even at the time when the ceremonial laws were 
holy, just and good. 

164 So Paul does not speak of a part of the law that 
is also good and holy, but of the whole law, that a work 
done according to the whole law does not justify. And he 
does not call it law sin or work of the flesh, but "work of 
the law," that is, a work done according to the law. Thus, 
if one does not kill, does not commit adultery, 2c., 
whether it be by natural ability, by human powers, by free 
will, or by God's gift, or by divine power, it does not justify. 

The works of the law can be done either before 
justification or after justification. Before justification, 
many good people, even among the

Pagans kept the law and did excellent works, like 
Lenophon, Aristides, Fabius, Cicero, Pomponius Atticus 
2c. Cicero steadfastly suffered death in a just and good 
cause. Pomponius was a truth-loving and constant man, 
who did not tell lies and did not like them in others. But 
constancy and love of truth are exceedingly good virtues 
and very beautiful works of the law; and yet they have 
not been justified by them. 

After justification, Peter, Paul and all Christians do 
works of the law, but they are not justified by them. Paul 
says [1 Cor. 4:4], "| am conscious of nothing, but in this 
lam not justified." So it is obvious that he is talking about 
the whole law and the works of the whole law, not about 
the sins against the law. 


Sophistic Theology. 


Therefore, the pernicious and ungodly opinion of the 
papists must be condemned, who attribute to a mere 
work (Operi operato) performed without faith that it 
deserves grace and forgiveness of sins. For they say 
that a good work before grace serves to obtain grace, 
that the same must be given according to equity (de 


congruo). But after the grace is already obtained, the 
following work deserves eternal life, that this must be 
given for the sake of worthiness (de condigno). 

168 For example: If a person living in mortal sin 
without grace does a good work out of good intention, 
that is, reads or hears mass, gives alms 2c., he 
deserves grace in equity (de congruo). But after he has 
obtained grace in equity in this way, then he can do a 
work (opus condignum) worthy [of reward], which 
deserves eternal life. In the case of the first, God is not 
obligated [to reward it] (debitor), but because He is good 
and just, it behooves Him to approve such a work, even 
if it is accomplished in mortal sin, and to give grace as 
remuneration for such service. According to grace, 
however, God is already a debtor. 


and is compelled by law to give eternal life, because it is 
now no longer merely a work of free will done according 


to essence (secundum substantiam), but also 
accomplished in pleasing grace, that is, in love. 

This is the theology of the antichristic empire, which 
| mention for the sake of a better understanding of Paul's 


disputatio, because when opposing things are held 
together, they appear all the clearer; then, so that it may 
become apparent how far these blind men and blind 
leaders have strayed from the truth, and how they have 
not only obscured the gospel with their ungodly and 
blasphemous doctrine, but have abolished it altogether 
and obscured Christ. 

For if, while living in mortal sin, | can do any work, 
however small, which is not only pleasing to God in its 
nature, but can also merit grace in equity, and if, having 
grace, | can do works of grace, that is, in love, and merit 
eternal life by right, what need have | of the grace of 
God, the forgiveness of sins, the promise, the death and 
victory of Christ? Christ is now of no use to me at all. For 
| have the free will and powers to do a good work, by 
which | earn grace according to equity, and afterwards 


also eternal life according to dignity (de condigno). 

Such insane monstrosities and horrible blasohemies 
should have been presented to Jews and Turks, but not 
to the Church of Christ. And this matter shows 
sufficiently that the pope with his bishops, doctors, 
monks 2c. had neither any knowledge of the holy things, 
nor had he taken care of them, nor had he been 
concerned about the blessedness of the abandoned and 
miserably scattered host. For if they had seen even in 
the remotest way, as through a mist, what Paul had said, 
they would not have seen it. 


1) Thus Luther translates de condigno, Walch, St. Louis edition, 
vol. XIX, 1161, §226. 


172' 


If they had called sin what grace is, they would not have 
imposed such abominations and such ungodly folly on 
the Christian people. 

They understood by mortal sin nothing other than an 
outward work committed against the Law, such as 
murder, adultery, theft 2c. They did not consider it mortal 
sin that one does not recognize God, that one has hatred 
and contempt for God in one's heart, that one is 
ungrateful to God and grumbles against Him, that one 
resists God's will, that the flesh can do nothing but think, 
speak and do against God and serve the devil. If they 
had recognized that this exceedingly great corruption is 
inherent in the nature of man, they would not have so 
ungodly played their foolish game with the merit of equity 
and dignity 2c. 

Therefore, it is necessary to give a clear explanation 
of what an ungodly man or a man in mortal sin is. But 
this is such a holy hypocrite and bloodhound as Paul 
was, since he traveled to Damaseus to persecute Jesus 
of Nazareth, to destroy the teaching of the Gospel, to kill 
the believers and to completely disturb the church of 
Christ. These were certainly the greatest and most 
horrible sins against God, but Paul could not see them. 
For he was so blinded by his ungodly zeal for GOD that 
he thought that these accursed shameful deeds were the 
highest righteousness, worship of God, and an 
obedience exceedingly pleasing to GOD. Of course, 
such saints, who defend such horrible sins as the highest 
righteousness, should deserve mercy! 

Therefore, we deny with Paul the merit of equity and 
dignity altogether, and declare most confidently that 
these speculations are nothing but the antics of Satan, 
which have never had any reality or been demonstrated 
by examples. For God has never given His grace and 
eternal life to any man for the merit of equity and dignity. 

175 These disputations of the scholastics about the 
merit according to equity and dignity are only fictions and 
dreamy musings (speculabilia somnia) of idle men about 
trivial things, on which the

173 


The whole papacy is still founded on it and is still based 
on it today. For every monk imagines this: | can earn 
grace according to equity by keeping the holy rule, but by 
the works | do after | have received grace, | can 
accumulate such great merit that it is not only sufficient 
for me to attain eternal life, but | can also communicate 
and sell it to others. This is how all monks have taught 
and lived, and today the papists are doing everything 
possible against us to defend this blatant blasphemy 
against Christ. And the holier such a hypocrite and 
workman is, the worse an enemy of the Gospel he is. 


The right Christian way to teach. 


176. On the other hand, the correct Christian way of 
teaching is this: that man should first recognize through 
the law that he is a sinner, to whom it is impossible to do 
any good work. For the law says: You are an evil tree, 
therefore everything you think, speak and do is against 
God. Therefore, you cannot earn grace by your works. If 
you nevertheless undertake this, then you make evil out 
of evil, because, since you are an evil tree, you can bring 
forth nothing but evil fruit, that is, sins, because "whatever 
does not come from faith is sin" [Rom. 14:23]. Therefore, 
whoever wants to earn grace through previous works, 
wants to propitiate God through sins, which is nothing 
other than heaping sins upon sins, ridiculing God and 
provoking His wrath. 

When a man is thus instructed, frightened and 
humbled by the law, and sees in truth the greatness of 
his sin, and does not find the slightest trace of love for 
God in himself, he justifies God in his words, and 
confesses that he is guilty of eternal death and 
damnation. The first part of the Christian doctrine is 
therefore the preaching of repentance and right self- 
knowledge. 

The second part [of this teaching] is: If you want to be 
blessed, you can take the

175 





Salvation is not obtained by works, but "God sent His 
only begotten Son into the world, that we might live 
through Him" [1 John 4:9]. He was crucified and died for 
you and "sacrificed your sins in his body" [1 Petr. 2, 24]. 
There is nothing that God would have to look upon 


favorably (nulla congruitas), or any work before grace, 
but nothing but wrath, sin, terror and death. Therefore, 
the law only shows sin, frightens and humbles, and in 
this way prepares for justification and drives to Christ. 
For God has revealed through His Word that He will be 
a gracious Father, who, since we can earn nothing, will 
give us forgiveness of sins, righteousness and eternal 
life for Christ's sake without our merit. For he is a God 
who gives his gifts freely to all, and this is the glory by 
which his divinity is praised. But he cannot defend this 
deity of his against the works righteous, for they do not 
want to accept grace and eternal life from him free of 
charge, but earn it with their works; therefore they want 
to rob him of the honor of deity. In order for him to keep 
it, he had to send the law beforehand to frighten and 
shatter these extremely hard rocks, as if by a 
thunderclap and lightning from heaven. 

This is in brief our theology of Christian 
righteousness against the abominations and 
monstrosities of the sophists of merit according to equity 
and dignity, or of works before grace and after grace. For 
such utterly trivial dreams have been invented out of their 
heads by sure men, who have never been exercised by 
temptations and real fright from sin and from death, 
therefore they do not understand what they speak or 
about what they assert. Then no example of a work 
before grace and after grace can be given. Thus, the 
papists deceive themselves and others with the most 
trivial fables. Reason: Paul says here very clearly that a 
man is not justified by the works of the law, whether they 
precede [before grace] (of which he speaks here) or 
follow. You see, then, that Christian righteousness is not 
a [pre 


The term "human being" is used by the Sophists when 
they say: "inhaerens forma": 


(Scholastic Theology.) 1) 


When a man does any good work, God is pleased 
with it and pours love into him for this work. This infused 


love, they say, is a quality (qUualitatem) adhering to the 
heart, and call it an essential justice (formalem 


justitiam) (it is well for you to know how to speak in this 
(scholastic) way), and can hear nothing less than that 
this quality, which gives a shape to the heart 
(informantem oor), like the white paint of a wall, is not a 
justice. They cannot come higher than to this thought of 
human reason: man is just by his essential justice 
(formali sua justitia), which is the grace that makes man 
GOtte pleasant (gratia gratum faciens), that is, love. 
Thus they attribute to this constitution (habitui) and form 


(formae) which attaches to the soul, that is, to love, 
which is a work and a gift that comes from the law (for 
the law says: "You shall love the Lord your God" 2c. 


(Deut. 6, 5.)), the essential (formal) righteousness, and 
say that the same is worthy of eternal life, and of him who 


has it they say that he is essentially (formaliter) 
righteous, but then also (righteous) in his doing 
(effective), because he now does good works, to which 
eternal life is due. This is the opinion of the sophists, 
namely those who are the best. 

Others are not so good as Scotus and Occam, who 
said that the love given by God is not necessary to obtain 
the grace of God, but man can bring about by natural 
forces that he loves God above all. For Scotus concludes 
thus: If a man can love the creature, a young man a girl, 
a miser money, which are lesser goods, then can 


1) This heading appears here in all editions. Because 
the following is most closely related to what precedes 
here, and the heading thus has a disturbing effect, we 
have placed it in brackets. At the end of the previous 
paragraph, the editions erroneously have a punctum.

He must also love God, who is a greater good. If man 
has love for the creature by natural forces, he has much 
more love for the Creator. 

182 All the sophists were overcome by this reason, 
and none of them could refute it. But they said: Scripture 
compels us to confess that God requires, in addition to 


natural love (A€MOreM), with which He is not satisfied, 


love (Caritatem), which has been given by Him. By this 
they accuse God of being a ferocious tyrant and cruel 
driver, who is not satisfied with my keeping and fulfilling 
His law, but above the law, which | can fulfill quite well, 
also demands that | fulfill it in a special way 
(circumstantia) and adornment or in a certain clothing. 
It is as if a housewife were not satisfied with the fact 
that the cook had prepared the food in the best possible 
way, but was angry with her because she had not 
prepared the food, dressed in a delicious garment and 
adorned with a golden crown. What kind of mistress 
would that be, who, in addition to what the cook is 
obliged to do and also does in an excellent manner, 
would demand of her that she should also wear a golden 
crown, which she cannot have? Also, what kind of God 
would this be, who would demand that we fulfill His law, 
which we otherwise keep by natural means, in such 
jewelry, which we cannot have? 
(184) But here they make a distinction, lest they should 
be regarded as asserting contradictory things, and say 
that the law is fulfilled in two ways; first, according to the 


essence of the thing (secundum substantiam facti), 
and secondly, according to the intention of him who 


commands (secundum intentionem praecipientis). 
According to the essence by the deed, that is, as far as 
the thing itself is concerned, we can certainly fulfill 
everything that the law commands, but not according to 
the intention of him who commands, for this is such that 
God is not satisfied that you have done and fulfilled 
everything that is commanded in the law, even though 
he can demand nothing more of you; but beyond that, he 
is not satisfied that you have done and fulfilled everything 
that is commanded in the law. 





177 


He demands this of you, that you fulfill the law in love, 
not in the natural love that you have, but in the 
supernatural and divine love that He gives. What does 
this mean other than making a tyrant and torturer out of 
GOD, who demands of us what we cannot perform? And 
there was little need for them to say publicly that it was 
not our fault, but God's fault that we were condemned, 
because He demands that we fulfill the law in this 
peculiar way. 

| repeat this and state it clearly in many words 
(inculco), so that you may see how far they have strayed 
from the right understanding of Scripture, saying that we 
can love God above all things by natural powers or at 
least earn grace and eternal life through a work done by 
faith (ex opere operato). But since God is not satisfied 
that we fulfill the law according to its essence through 
action, but wants it to be fulfilled also according to the 
intention of Him who commands, therefore the Holy 
Scriptures compel us to have a supernatural ability 


(habitum) infused from heaven, which is love, of which 
they said it is the essential (formal) righteousness, which 
gives faith its proper form (informantem fidem) and 
adorns it and causes it to be justified by it [love]. Thus 
faith is the body, the shell, the color, but love is the life, 


the core, the essence (forma). These are the dreams of 
the school theologians. 


But we 

subs 

titute faith for this love, and as they say, faith is the first 
design, 


and love the living colors and the complete execution, we 
say, on the other hand, that faith takes hold of Christ, 


who [Christ] is the essence (forma) that adorns faith and 


gives it its proper form (informat), like the color of the 
wall. Therefore, Christian faith is not an idle quality 


(qualitas) or an empty shell in the heart, which could 
also be present in mortal sin, until love comes along and 
makes it alive, but if it is the right faith, it is a certain 
confidence of the heart and a firm trust, by which it is 
possible for the heart to be able to take hold of Christ.

179 





ches Christ is grasped, so that Christ is the object to 
which faith is directed, yes, not the object, but that | say 
so, Christ is present in faith itself. 

So faith is a knowledge or rather a darkness that 
sees nothing, and yet Christ sits in this darkness, seized 
by faith, as God sat on Mount Sinai and in the temple in 
the midst of the darkness. So it is our essential 


(formalis) righteousness, not love, that gives faith its 
proper form, but faith itself, and the darkness (nebula) 


Of the heart, that is, the confidence in something that we 
do not see, that is, in Christ, who is nevertheless 
present, even though he is not seen at all. 

So faith justifies because it takes hold of and 
possesses this treasure, namely the present Christ. But 
in what way he is present cannot be grasped by thought, 
for it is, as | have said, a darkness. Now where there is 
right confidence of heart, Christ is present in this 


darkness and faith. And this is the essential (formalis) 
righteousness for the sake of which man is justified, not 
for the sake of love, as the Sophists speak. In short, as 


the Sophists say that love gives form to faith and brings 
it about, so we say that Christ gives form to faith and 
brings it about, or that he is the essence (formam) of 


faith. Christ, then, taken in faith and dwelling in the 
heart, is the Christian righteousness for whose sake 
GOD esteems us righteous and gives us eternal life. 
There is certainly no work of the law, no love, but a far 
different righteousness, and a kind of new world outside 
the law and above the law. For Christ or faith is not a law 
nor a work of the law. Of this matter, which the Sophists 
neither taught nor understood, we shall speak more fully 
hereafter. For now it is enough that we have briefly 
shown that Paul is not only speaking of the ceremonial 
law, but of the whole law. 

189 | remarked above that it was a very 





It is a pernicious error that the scholastic theologians 
have taught that man obtains forgiveness of sins and 
justification in this way, if he earns, through previous 
works, which they call merits in equity (merita congrui), 
the grace, which they call a quality attached to the will 


(qualitatem), which God has bestowed over the love 
that we have by natural powers. If one has this, they say, 


man is essentially (formaliter) righteous and in truth a 
Christian. This opinion, | say, is ungodly and pernicious, 
for it makes nothing but Turks, Jews, Anabaptists, 
enthusiasts 2c. For who should not be able to do a good 
work by human ability without grace, and in this way earn 
grace 2c.? Thus those dreamers have made faith an 
empty quality (qualitatem) in the soul, which alone is 
worth nothing without love; but if love is added, then it is 
powerful and justifies. 

190. But the following works, they said, serve to earn 
eternal life according to dignity (de condigno), insucha 
way that God, for the sake of the love that He has poured 
into the will of man, accepts this following work, so that 
He gives eternal life for it. For so they say: God accepts 


a good work [so that it serves] to eternal life (acceptare 
ad vitam), but He does not accept an evil work 


(deacceptare) [so that it serves] to damnation and 
eternal punishment. In the dream they heard something 
about acceptance (de acceptatione) and then related 
this to the works and attributed it to them. All this is 
erroneous and blasphemous against Christ, although not 
all speak so well of it, but some, as | have said, have 
taught that by purely natural powers we can love God 
above all things. It is useful to know this, so that what 
Paul says here may become all the clearer. 


Right Christian way to teach. 


191. against these foolish things and quite futile 
dreams we teach, as we have also recalled above [§ 176 
ff], the faith and the right way of the Christian being thus,

Man shall first be taught by the law to know himself, that 
he may learn to pray with the prophet: "They are all 
sinners, and lack the glory which they ought to have in 
God", likewise: "There is none righteous, neither is there 
any, there is none understanding, there is none that 
asketh after God; they are all gone astray" 2c. [Ps. 14, 
1. 2. 3.]; likewise [Ps. 51, 6.]:"In you alone have | sinned" 
2c. Thus, in the opposite way, we deter men from merit 
according to equity and according to dignities. But when 
man has been humbled by the law and made to know 
himself, then he has become truly penitent (for true 
repentance begins with the fear and judgment of God), 
and sees that he is such a great sinner that he cannot 
be freed from sins by his powers, efforts, and works. 

Only then does he understand what Paul means 
when he says that man is a servant and prisoner of sin; 
likewise: God has decided everything under sin; the 
whole world is guilty before God 2c. [Then he sees that 
the theology of the sophists about merit according to 
equity and dignity is a useless babble 1) and that the 
whole pabstry falls to this. Here now arises such a 
groaning: Who can help here? For the man who is 
frightened by the law completely despairs of his strength, 
looks around and sighs for a mediator and savior. 

193 Then the healing word of the gospel comes at 
the right time and says: "Be of good cheer, my son, your 
sins are forgiven. Believe in Jesus Christ, who was 
crucified for your sins 2c. When you feel your sins, do 
not look at them on yourself, but remember that they are 
laid on Christ, whose wounds have healed you 2c. Is. 
53, 5.1 Petr. 2, 24. 

194 This is the beginning of blessedness. In this way 
we are freed from sin, we are justified, and eternal life is 
given to us, not for the sake of our merits and works, but 
for the sake of faith. 


1) paTaioAoyia - theologia a play on words. 





for the sake of which we take hold of Christ. For this 
reason we also assume a [special] quality (qualitatem) 


and an essential righteousness (formalem justitiam) in 
the heart, but not, as the Sophists do, love, but faith, but 
in such a way that the heart has nothing else in mind and 
grasps but the Savior Christ. But then it is necessary that 


you know what Christ really is (definite). Because the 
sophists did not know this, they made him a judge and a 
tormentor, and they invented this quite foolish little fiction 
of merit according to equity and dignity. 

But Christ is not really a legislator, but a reconciler 
and savior. Faith grasps this and believes without a 
doubt that he has accomplished works and merits 
according to equity and dignity more than superfluously, 
for he could have done enough for the sins of the world 
with a single drop of his blood. But now he has done 
enough for us. Hebr. 9, 12: "By His own blood He entered 
into the Holy Place" 2c., and Rom. 3, 24: "We are justified 
without merit by His grace, through the redemption that 
came by Christ, whom God made a mercy seat by faith 
in His blood" 2c. Therefore it is a great thing that one 
should take hold of Christ in faith, who bears the sin of 
the world, and this faith alone is counted as 
righteousness, Rom. 3, 28. 4, 5. 

Here it is well to note that these three things, faith, 
Christ, and the acceptance or imputation of Christ's 
righteousness, belong together. Faith grasps Christ and 
has Him present and enclosed, as a ring encloses a 
precious stone, and anyone who is found to have 
grasped Christ with this confidence in his heart, God 
counts him righteous. This is the way and the merit by 
which we attain to the forgiveness of sins and to 
righteousness. Because you believe in me, says God, 
and your faith takes hold of Christ, whom | have given 
you to be your mediator and high priest, therefore you 
shall be righteous. 

197. so GOD accepts us or reckons us 


182 dri. 6ai. 1, 195-197. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1825-1828. 183 


2c. and this acceptance 1) or imputation is very 
necessary, firstly because we are not yet perfectly 
righteous, but in this life sin in the flesh still clings to us. 
This sin, which is still left in the flesh, God sweeps out in 
us. On the other hand, we are sometimes also 
abandoned by the Holy Spirit and fall into sins, like Peter, 
David and other saints. But we always have access to 
this article, that our sins are covered and that God will not 
impute them to us, Ps. 32, 1. 2. Rom. 4, 7.It is not that sin 
is no longer there (as the Sophists taught that one must 


do good works [bene operandum esse] until we are no} 
longer aware of sin), rather, sin is truly there, and the 
godly feel it, but it is hidden and not imputed to us by God 
for Christ's sake; because we take hold of Him in faith, all 
sins must not be sins. But where Christ and faith are not, 
there is no forgiveness of sins, no covering of them, but 
only imputation and condemnation of sins. Thus God 
wants the Son to be glorified, and He Himself wants to be} 
glorified in us through Him. 

198. Having taught faith in Christ in this way, we also} 
teach about good works: Because you have received 
Christ in faith, through whom you are justified, begin to 
do good works, love God and your neighbor, call on God, 
thank Him, praise, extol and confess Him, do good to your 
neighbor and serve him, carry out your ministry honestly. 
These are truly good works that flow from this faith and 
from the gladness of heart that we have obtained 
because our sins have been forgiven in vain through 
Christ. 

All the crosses and sufferings that are to be borne 
afterwards can be borne easily. For the yoke that Christ 
lays out is gentle and the burden is light [Matth. 11, 30]. 
For since sin is forgiven and the conscience is freed from 
the burden and biting of sin, a Christian can easily bear 
everything. 


1) Jena and Erlangen acceptio instead of the otherwise} 
consistently used acceptatio, which the Wittenberg also} 
offers here. 


Because inwardly everything is gentle and sweet, he 
does and suffers everything willingly. But when man 
walks in his own righteousness, everything he does and 
suffers is difficult for him, and it is burdensome to him 
because he does it unwillingly. 

(200) Therefore we make the declaration that he who 
has no sin or feels no sin is a Christian, but his sin is not 
imputed to him because of his faith in Christ. This 
doctrine gives a firm comfort to consciences that are in 
real terror, and therefore it is not in vain that we try so 
often and with so much diligence to impress upon people 
that sins are forgiven us and righteousness is imputed to 
us for Christ's sake; likewise that a Christian should have 
nothing at all to do with the law and with sin, especially 
in temptations. If he is a Christian, he is above the law 
and sin. For he has Christ, the Lord of the law, present 
and enclosed in his heart, as a ring encloses a precious 
stone. Therefore, when the law accuses him, when sin 
terrifies him, 2c. he looks at Christ. When he has grasped 
Him in faith, he has with him the victor over the law, over 
sin, death and the devil, who rules over all these so that 
they can do him no harm. 

Therefore, a Christian, in the true meaning of the 
word (proprie definitus), is free from all laws and 
absolutely subject to no one, either inwardly or 
outwardly. But | say with special emphasis: if he is a 
Christian (not if he is a man or a woman), that is, if he 
has aconscience that is clothed, adorned and made rich 
by this faith, by this great and immeasurable treasure, 
or, as Paul says, this unspeakable gift, which cannot be 
exalted and praised highly enough, because it makes 
children and heirs of God. Therefore, a Christian is 
greater than the whole world because he has this, as it 
seems, small gift in his heart, but this [seemingly] small 
gift and thing of value, which he holds in faith, is greater 
than heaven and earth because Christ is greater, who is 
this gift. 

(202) Where this doctrine exists and remains 
inviolate, which leads the consciences to peace. 


184 Lri. Oai. 1, 197-200. Explanation of Galatians 2, 16, W. 


Christians are made judges of all doctrines and are 
masters of all the laws of the whole world. They can most 
certainly judge that the Turk is damned with his Alkoran, 
because he does not walk on the right road, i.e., does 
not recognize that he is a wretched and damned sinner, 
nor does he grasp Christ in faith, believing that his sins 
are forgiven him for Christ's sake. So he also confidently 
pronounces against the pope the verdict that he is 
damned with his whole kingdom, because he and all his 
monks and high schools are based on the idea that we 
attain grace through merit according to equity, but are 
later admitted to heaven through merit according to 
dignity. Then a Christian says: This is not the right way 
to become righteous, this is not the way to enter heaven. 
| cannot earn grace according to equity by the preceding 
works, nor gain eternal life according to dignity by the 
following merits, but to him who believes in Christ his sin 
is forgiven and righteousness imputed. This confidence 
makes him God's child and heir, who has in hope the 
eternal life that has been promised to him. Through faith 
in Christ, therefore, we are given everything: grace, 
peace, forgiveness of sins, blessedness and eternal life, 
not through merit according to equity and dignity. 

Therefore, this doctrine of the writers of sentences of 
merit according to equity and dignity, all services, 
masses and the innumerable endowments of the papal 
kingdom are abominable blasphemies, theft of God and 
denial of Christ, as Peter, 2 Peter 2:1, foretold with these 
words: "There shall be false teachers among you, which 
shall bring in corrupt sects, and shall deny the Lord that 
bought them," 2c. as if he wanted to say: "The Lord hath 
redeemed us, and bought us, to make us righteous and 
blessed; this is the way of righteousness and salvation: 
The LORD hath redeemed us, and bought us with his 
blood, to make us righteous and blessed; this is the way 
to righteousness and blessedness. But false teachers 
will come who will deny the Lord, blaspheme the way of 
truth, righteousness and salvation, and invent new ways 
of falsehood and destruction, and many will follow their 
destruction 2c. 





VIII, 1828-1832. 185 

In this whole chapter, Peter has excellently portrayed 
the papacy, which has set aside the gospel and faith in 
Christ and taught works and human statutes, such as 
merit according to equity and dignity, the distinction of 
days, meals, and persons, vows, the invocation of the 
saints, pilgrimages, and purgatory 2c. The papists have 
so imbibed these enthusiastic opinions of statutes and 
works that it is impossible for them to understand even 
one syllable of the Gospel, faith and Christ. 

205. And this shows the matter itself sufficiently. For 
they arrogate to themselves the right which Christ alone 
has. He alone frees from sin, gives righteousness and 
eternal life. That we can attain this without Christ 
through merit according to equity and dignity, they lie 
impudently and ungodly. This is what Peter and the 
other apostles call "introducing corrupt sects", "denying 
Christ", "trampling underfoot the fine blood", 
blaspheming the Holy Spirit and the grace of God. 
Therefore, no one can sufficiently see how horrible 
papist idolatry is. As unspeakable is the gift that is 
offered to us through Christ, as horrible are the papist 


desecrations of the sanctuary (profanationes). 

Therefore, one should not disregard these 
[abominations] or let them be forgotten, but diligently 
observe them, which also serves to make the grace of 
God and the good deeds of Christ more glorious through 
the opposite. The more | realize how horribly God is 
desecrated by the Papist Mass, the more horror and 
disgust | have for it, and | grasp the right custom of the 
Mass [i.e., of the Lord's Supper], which is to be observed 
by all. of the Lord's Supper], which the pope has 
abolished and made a bad commodity out of it, which, if 
one buys it, can be of use to someone else, for he says 
that an apostate sacristan, who denies Christ and 
blasphemes the Holy Spirit, who stands at the altar, 
does a good work, not only for himself, but also for 
others, for the living and the dead, and for the whole 
church, for no other reason than that the 
accomplishment of the work brings this about (ex opere 
operato) 2c. 


186 oai. i, 200-202. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, i832-i836. 


Therefore one can already see from this that God's 
patience is immeasurably great, that he has not long 
since destroyed the whole of Pabstism and turned it 
back with fire and brimstone, like Sodom and Gomorrah. 
But these lovely people want to cover and decorate their 
godlessness and shamefulness; one should not be silent 
about this. 

Therefore, we must illuminate the article of 
justification with the utmost diligence, so that, like the 
sun at noon, it may bring them out of the darkness and 
gloom of their hypocrisy into the light and expose their 
shameful nature and shame. 

For this reason, we are pleased to pursue the 
righteousness of faith with the utmost vigor and 
emphasis, so that the adversaries may be put to shame 
and this article may become firm and certain in our 
hearts. And this is extremely necessary, because if we 
lose this sun, we will fall back into the former darkness. 
But it is quite frightening that the pope has been able to 
bring this about in the church, that Christ has been 
denied, trampled underfoot, insulted and blasphemed, 
namely through the gospel and the sacraments, which 
he has so obscured and turned into such a shameful 
abuse that they have served him against Christ to raise 
up and strengthen his diabolical abominations. O, 
darkness and immeasurable wrath of God! 


So we also believe in Christ JEsum (for 
what?), that we may be justified 2c. 


This is the right Christian way to teach, that we are 
justified by faith in Christ, not by the works of the law. 
Here you must not allow yourself to be challenged by the 
ungodly gloss of the Sophists, who say that faith justifies 
only when love and good works are added. With this 
pernicious gloss, the sophists have obscured and 
corrupted this and similar sayings in Paul's writings, in 
which he most clearly ascribes justification to faith. 

But when a man hears that he must believe in Christ, 


but that faith does not justify unless this form (forma) is 


added, namely love, then he immediately falls away from 
faith and thinks: 


187 


If faith without love does not justify, then faith is idle and 
useless, and love alone justifies, for if faith has not 


gained the right form (fides formata) and is adorned by 
love, it is nothing. 

212. and to prove their harmful and pernicious gloss, 
the adversaries draw on the passage 1 Cor. 13, 1. 2: "If 
| spoke with the tongues of men and with the tongues of 
angels 2c. and had not love, | should be nothing." This 
passage is their iron wall. 

But they are people without understanding, therefore 
they understand and see nothing of what Paul teaches, 
and with this false interpretation they have not only done 
violence to Paul's words, but also denied Christ and 
destroyed all his benefits. Therefore one should avoid it 
[this gloss] like a hellish poison and conclude with Paul 
that we are justified by faith alone, not by faith that has 


gained a form through love (fide formata caritate). 
Therefore, the power of justification must not be 
ascribed to this pleasing form (formae gratificanti), but 
to the faith which grasps Christ the Savior Himself and 
possesses Him in the heart. This faith justifies without 
love and before love. 

We admit that one must also teach about good works 
and love, but in its own time and place, namely when 
dealing with the question of works outside of this main 
article. Here, however, it is the question by which we are 
justified and obtain eternal life. Here we answer with 
Paul that we are declared righteous because of faith in 
Christ alone, not because of the works of the law or 
because of love; not that we reject works or love, as the 
adversaries blame us, but we do not want to be 
distracted from the main point around which the present 
trade revolves, which Satan would like to do. Since we 
are now dealing with the doctrine of justification, we 
reject and condemn works, for this article does not allow 
us to deal with good works at all. In this matter, therefore, 
we cut short all laws and all works of the law. 


188 Lri. Kai. 1, 202-204. Explanation of Galatians 2, 16, W. Vill, [836-1839. 189 





215 But the law is good, just, and holy. Very well; but 
since we are now dealing with the doctrine of 
justification, it is not now the place to speak of the law, 
but the question is, what is Christ, and what good deed 
has he shown us? But Christ is not the law, he is not my 
work or a work of the law, he is not my love or the law's 
love, he is not my chastity, obedience or poverty, but the 
Lord over life and death, the mediator and savior of 
sinners, the redeemer of those who are under the law. In 
Him we are through faith, and He in us, Joh. 6, 56. This 
bridegroom must be alone with the bride in the chamber, 
but all servants and the whole household must remain 
outside. But after that, when he opens the door and steps 
out, the servants and maids may run in, serve, bring food 
and drink. That is when the works and love begin. 

In order to describe Christ correctly, we must 
carefully distinguish all laws, including divine laws, and 
all works from the promise of the gospel and from faith. 
Christ, however, is not a law, therefore not a driver of 
either the law or works, but he is "God's lamb who bears 
the sin of the world," John 1:29. This is grasped by faith 
alone, not by love, which must follow faith, but as a kind 
of gratitude. 

Therefore, victory over sin and death, blessedness 
and eternal life are not granted to us by the law, not by 
the works of the law, not by the powers of free will or by 
our will, but only through Jesus Christ. 


The opponents call us Solaris, because they do not 
understand the matter Paul is dealing with here 2c. 


That we may be justified by faith in Christ, and 
not by the works of the law. 


219 All these words should be emphasized in the 
eading, because they are of great importance. Paul, as | 
ave reminded you above, is speaking not only of the 
ceremonial law, but of the whole law. For the ceremonial 
aw was as much divine as the moral law; as, 
circumcision, the institution of the priesthood, the service 
of God and the customs of worship were as much 
commanded by God as the holy ten commandments. 
Likewise, it was a law when Abraham was commanded 
to sacrifice his son Isaac. This work of Abraham pleased 
God, as did other ceremonial works, yet he was not 
ustified by this work, but by faith, for the Scripture says 
Rom. 4:3]: "Abraham believed God, and this was 
counted to him for righteousness." 

3(220) But after Christ is revealed, they say, the 
ceremonial laws are fatal. 4) Yes, [so we teach,] even the 
aw of the ten commandments is deadly without faith in 
Christ. Further, there must be no law in the conscience, 
but only the spirit of life, by which in Christ we are freed 
from the law of the letter and of death, from its works and 
its sins; not that the law is evil, but because it cannot 
justify, since it has the quite opposite effect. So it is an

could remain in such great darkness and error. There 
have always been some whom God has called in pure 
doctrine through the text of the Gospel (which has 
nevertheless remained in the sermon) and through 
baptism. These walked in simplicity and humility of heart, 
thinking that only the monks and those who were 
smeared by the bishops were holy and _ spiritual 


(religiosos), but they were unholy and_ secular 


(saeculares), in no way to be compared with them; and 
because they therefore found nothing of good works or 
merits in themselves, which they could have held against 
the wrath and judgment of God, they took refuge in the 
suffering and death of Christ and became blessed in this 
simplicity. 

227. It is a terrible and immeasurable wrath of God 
that for so many centuries He has punished the 
ingratitude and contempt of the Gospel and Christ in the 
papists by giving them over to a wrong mind, so that they 
completely denied and blasphemed Christ, as far as the 
custom of the same is concerned, and instead of the 
Gospel they accepted the abominations of rules and 
human statutes, which they worshipped only and 
preferred to the word of God, until finally marriage was 
taken from them and they were forced into this unchaste 
celibate state. Then they were also defiled outwardly 
with every kind of shameful deed, adultery, fornication, 
uncleanness, sodomy 2c. This was the fruit of the impure 
celibacy. 

Thus God, punishing sin with sin, gave them over 
inwardly to a perverse mind and outwardly to such 
abominable vices, and rightly so, because they 
blasphemed the only begotten Son of God, in whom the 
Father wants to be glorified; he gave him to death, so 
that those who believe in the Son would be saved 
through him, not through their orders. "Whoever honors 
me," says GOD 1 Sam. 2, 30, "I will also honor." But God 
is honored in His Son, John 5:23. Therefore, whoever 
believes that the Son of God is our Mediator and Savior, 
honors the Father, whom God also honors in turn, that 
is, he adorns Him with His gifts, with forgiveness of sins, 
with righteousness, with the 


193 


Holy Spirit, with eternal life 2c. But those who despise 


me, he says, they also shall be despised (ignobiles) 2c. 

229 The main conclusion is this: "For by the works of 
the law no flesh is justified. This you further strike out 
and apply to all classes: Thus no monk will be justified 
by his order, no nun by her chastity, no citizen by his 
righteousness, no prince by his good deeds 2c. The law 
of God is greater than the whole world, for it passes over 
all men, and the works of the law are more excellent than 
all the self-chosen works of the works saints; and yet 
Paul says that neither the law nor the works of the law 
justify; therefore faith alone justifies. 

Now that this main proposition (propositione) is 
established, he begins to confirm it with reasons of proof, 
and the first of these reasons of proof, which is taken, as 
it were, from the opposite of what is stated in the 


conclusion (ex Opposito consequentis), is this: 


V.17. But if we ourselves, who seek to be justified 
by Christ, should also be found sinners, Christ would 
be a minister of sin. 


This is not Latin, but Hebrew and _ theological 
language. If this is true, that we are justified by Christ, 
then it is impossible for us to be sinners or to be justified 
by the law. On the other hand, if it is not true, but we 
must be justified by the law and works of the law, then it 
is impossible for us to be justified by Christ. One of the 
two must be false; either we are not justified by Christ, 
or not by the law. But we are justified by Christ, therefore 
not by the law. He thus concludes, "But if we seek," 2c. 
that is, if we seek to be justified by faith in Christ, and, 
having been thus justified, we are still found sinners who 
need the law to justify us sinners; if, | say, the keeping of 
the law is necessary to justification, so that those who 
are justified in the law may be justified in the law. 


194 dri. 6ai. 1, 208-211. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1850-1854. 


195 





If the one who has been justified by Christ is not to be 
justified, but still needs the justifying law, or if the one 
who has been justified by Christ still needs to be justified 
by the law, then Christ is nothing but a lawgiver and 
servant of sin. Therefore, he who is justified and holy 
through Christ is not justified and holy, but still needs the 
righteousness and holiness of the law. 

232 But we are certainly justified and righteous 
through Christ, because the truth of the Gospel teaches 
that man is not justified by the law, but by Christ. But if 
those who are justified by Christ are still found to be 
sinners, that is, they still belong to the law and are under 
the law, as the false apostles teach, so they are not yet 
justified, because the law accuses them and convicts 
them that they are still sinners, and demands that they 
do works of the law so that they may be justified, it 
follows that those who are justified in Christ are not 
justified. And so it necessarily follows that Christ must 


not be a justifier, but a minister of sin. 

With these words he most severely accuses the false 
apostles and all works saints of perverting everything, 
because they turn the law into grace, grace into the law, 
Moses into Christ, Christ into Moses. For they teach that 
after Christ and after all the righteousness of Christ, the 
observance of the law is still necessary if one wants to 
become righteous. Thus, by an intolerable perversion, 
the law becomes Christ, because to the law is ascribed 
that which properly belongs to Christ. They say: If you do 
the works of the law, you will be justified. If you do not do 
them, you will not be justified, no matter how much you 
believe in Christ. But if it is true that Christ does not 
justify, but is a minister of sin, as necessarily follows from 
their doctrine, then Christ is a law, because we have 
nothing else from him, since he teaches that we are 
sinners, than what we have also by the law; and so the 
minister of sin, Christ, sends us to the law and to Moses 
as the justifier. 


Therefore, the papists and all those who do not know 
the righteousness of Christ or do not hold fast to it, must 
make Christ into Moses and the law, and the law into 
Christ. For they teach that faith in Christ justifies, but at 
the same time the commandments of God must be kept, 
because it is written [Matt. 19:17], "If thou wilt enter into 
life, keep the commandments of God." Then 
immediately Christ is denied and faith is destroyed, 
because to the commandments of God or to the law is 
ascribed that which belongs to Christ alone. For Christ 
is, if one wants to describe him properly, the justifier and 
redeemer of sins. If | attribute this to the law, then the 
law itself is my justifier, in that it frees me from sins 
because | do its works. And so the law is Christ, and 
Christ completely loses his name, office and honor, and 
he is nothing but a servant of the law, who accuses, 
terrifies, abandons and sends the sinner to another who 
can justify him, which in truth is the office of the law. 

But the real ministry of Christ is that he receives the 
sinner, who has been put in the dock by the law and 
convicted of his guilt, in the most friendly way and 
absolves him of sins, if he believes the gospel. "For 
Christ is the end of the law; he who believes in Him is 
righteous" [Rom. 10:4]; "He is the Lamb of God who 
bears the sin of the world" [John 1:29]. But because the 
papists and the enthusiasts do not hold to the doctrine 
of justification, they reverse everything, make a Moses 
out of Christ and a Christ out of Moses, and it is indeed 
(although they say otherwise in words) their most noble 
doctrine: Christ is a Moses 2c. Then they ridicule us, 
who inculcate and insist on faith with such great care, 
and say: Ha, ha, faith, faith, wait until you go to heaven 
by faith. You must seek higher things, you must fulfill the 
law of God, as it is written [Luc. 10, 28.], "Do this, and 
you shall live." You must suffer many things, shed your 
blood, leave your house, wife and children, follow the 
example of Christ.

follow. The faith you exalt so much makes people 
secure, sluggish and sleepy. Thus they become mere 
teachers of the law and doers of works, falling away from 
Christ to Moses, likewise leading people from baptism, 
faith and the promises of Christ back to the law and 
works, turning grace into law and law into grace. 

But who could ever have believed that these two 
things could so easily have been mixed up? No one's 
mind is so clumsy that this very slight difference between 
law and grace should not be obvious to him, 1) because 
the nature of things and words brings this difference with 
it. For everyone understands that these words: "law", 
"grace", are different in matter and in name. Therefore, 
it is an exceedingly strange phenomenon that, while this 
quite clear difference is certain, the adversaries have 
nevertheless fallen into this devilish falsity, that they mix 
the law and grace and transform Christ into a Moses. 

“Therefore, | often say that this doctrine of faith is 
very easy, and that everyone can easily understand this 
difference between law and grace, as far as the words 
are concerned, but that the same is the most difficult 
thing in application, in life, in the heart and conscience 


(affectu). 

The pope with his scholastic teachers clearly says 
that the law and grace are distinct, and yet, where it 
comes into use, he teaches the very opposite. Faith in 


Christ, he says, may it be acquired (acquisita) by natural 
powers, actions and behavior (habitus), or may it be 


infused (infusa) by God, is nevertheless dead, if love 
does not follow. Where is the distinction between law 
and grace here? According to the name he distinguishes 
them 


1) In Latin in old editions: cui non appareat ... distinctio facillima 
esse. To lift the grammatical error in these words, either distinctionem 
facillimam must be read, or 6886 is to be deleted. We have preferred 
the latter, because it corresponds best to the context.

He calls grace "love" with the deed. In this way, all those 
who practise the law attribute justification to works. For 
this reason, all those who do not rightly hold to the article 
of justification necessarily confuse the law and grace. 

’Therefore let every godly man carefully learn to 
distinguish the law from grace, in heart 4) and in practice, 
and not, as the pope and the enthusiasts do, only in 
words. As far as words are concerned, they admit that 
these two things are different, but as far as deeds are 
concerned, as | have said, they mix them up, because 
they do not admit that faith without works justifies. If this 
is true, then Christ is already of no use to me. No matter 
how much | may have the right faith, | will not be justified, 
as they think, if my faith is without love, and no matter 
how much | may have it, | do not love enough. And so, if 
Christ is taken by faith, he is not a justifier, grace is of no 
use, nor can there be true faith without love (or as the 
Anabaptists say, without the cross, suffering, and 
shedding of blood); but if love, works, and the cross are 
present, it is true faith and makes one just. 

240 With this doctrine, the enthusiasts today again 
obscure the good deeds of Christ, deprive him of the 
honor of a justifier, and make him a minister of sin. They 
have learned nothing from us except that they repeat the 
words; they do not hold to the matter itself. They want to 
be regarded as teaching the gospel and faith in Christ 
purely, as we do, but when it comes to application, they 
are teachers of the law, in all respects like the false 
apostles. For just as they insisted in all the churches that 
circumcision and the observance of the gospel should be 
added to faith in Christ, so they also insisted that the 
gospel and the faith in Christ should be taught purely, as 
we do.

of the law, without which, as they said, faith has no 
justifying power, for they said Apost. 15:1: "Unless ye be 
circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be 
saved": so nowadays, besides the righteousness of faith, 
the legalists also demand the fulfillment of the 
commandments of God according to this word [Luc. 
10:28]: "Do this, and thou shalt live"; likewise [Matt. 
19:17]: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the 
commandments." Therefore no one among them 
understands the difference between law and grace, 
however wise they may think themselves to be, for they 
are convicted of it by the custom they make of it and by 
the judgment they pass on the matter. 

But we make a distinction here, and say that we do 
not now deal with the question whether one should do 
good works, nor do we ask whether the law is good, holy, 
righteous, or whether one must keep it, for that is quite a 
different doctrine; but our business and our question is 
of justification, whether the law makes righteous. Our 
adversaries do not hear this, nor do they answer this 
question, nor do they make any distinction, as we do, but 
only cry out: one must do good works, one must keep 
the law. Well, we know that. But because these are 
different doctrines, we will not suffer them to be mixed 
up with each other. In time we will also deal with this 
teaching, that one must keep the law and do good works. 
But since we are dealing here with the doctrine of 
justification, we now reject the works that the adversaries 


stubbornly (mordicus) hold on to and_ ascribe 
justification to. This means that we take away Christ's 
glory and attribute it to works. 

242 This, then, is a very solid ground of proof, which 
| have often used for my great comfort, since Paul says 
[v. 17], "But should we who seek" 2c., as if to say: If we, 
who are justified by Christ, are not yet reckoned justified, 
but sinners, who must first be justified by the law, it 
follows that we cannot seek justification in Christ, but by 
the law. But if justification is through the law, it is not 
through grace, 


what results if one divides rightly (a Sufficienti 


divisione). If then justification is not by grace, but by 
law, what did Christ accomplish by his suffering, by his 
preaching, by his victory over sin and death, and by the 
sending of the Holy Spirit? So we are either justified by 


Christ, or we are made sinners and guilty (rei) by him. 
But if the law justifies, it follows inevitably that we are 
made sinners through Christ, that is, that Christ is a 
minister of sin. Therefore, let this sentence be 
established: Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus 
Christ is a sinner and guilty of eternal death, and unless 
he takes recourse to the law and does the works of the 
law, he cannot be saved. 

The holy Scriptures, especially those of the New 
Testament, everywhere inculcate faith in Christ and 
praise him gloriously. They say: Whoever believes in 
Him will be saved, will not perish, will not be judged, will 
not be put to shame, and will have eternal life [John 3:16, 
18]. In contrast, they say: He that believeth on him is 
damned 2c., because he hath faith without works, which 
condemneth. Thus they pervert everything; out of Christ 
they make a destroyer, and out of Moses they make a 
beatifier. But is it not an immense blasphemy that they 
teach in this way? If you do the law and its works, you 
will be worthy of eternal life, but if you believe in Christ, 
you will be guilty of eternal death; the law, if kept, makes 
you blessed, but faith in Christ condemns you? 

The adversaries do not use such words, but in fact 


they teach in this way, because, as they say, infused 
faith (fides infusa) (which they actually call faith in 
Christ) does not make one free from sin, but faith that 
has gained a proper form through love (fides formata 
caritate). From this it follows that faith in Christ alone, 
without law and works, does not make one blessed. This 
is certainly the same as saying that Christ leaves us in 
sins and God's wrath and makes us guilty of eternal 


death. On the other hand, if you keep the law and do 
works 


200 Lri. 6ai. 1, 215-217. Explanation of Galatians 2, 17. W. VIII, 1860-1864. 


201 





then faith justifies, because it has the works, without 
which faith is otherwise of no use. So it is works that 
justify, not faith, because that from which anything else 
has its special nature must have the same nature in a 
higher degree. If faith justifies for the sake of works, then 
it follows that works justify more than faith. The 
abominations of this blasphemous doctrine are 
immeasurable. 

Thus Paul's proof is based on the fact that [if the false 
teachers were right] the impossible would follow, and that 
they would have to admit this conclusion as correct if they 
were right. 1) If we, who are justified by Christ, are still 
sinners who must be justified by something other than 
Christ, namely, by the law, it follows that Christ cannot 
justify us, but only accuses and condemns us. Therefore 
he died in vain, and these and similar sayings are false 
[Joh. 1, 29.]: "Behold, this is the Lamb of God" 2c., 
likewise [Joh. 3, 36.): "He who believes in the Son has 
eternal life", yes, the whole Scripture, which testifies that 
Christ is the Justifier and Savior of the world, is false. For 
if we are still found sinners after we have been justified 
by Christ, it must necessarily follow that those who keep 
the law without Christ are justified. If this is true, then we 
are Turks, Jews, Tartars, who only keep the word and the 
name of Christ in appearance, but in fact and truth 
completely deny Christ and his word. 

But Paul wants faith to be unadorned (1 Tim. 1, 5.). 
Therefore, it is an error and impiety to claim that the faith 
given by God (fidem infusam) does not justify if it is not 
adorned by the works of love. But if the adversaries want 
to defend this, why do they not throw away faith in Christ 
altogether? Especially since they make nothing else out 
of it than a useless something (inanem qualitatem) in the 
soul, which is of no use without love. Why 


1) Latin: Argumentatur ergo Paulus ab impossibili et sufficienti 
divisione. 





Do they not rather call the thing by its right name? That 
is, why do they not say in clear words that works justify, 
and not faith? Likewise, why do they not publicly deny 
the whole gospel in general and renounce Paul (which 
they do in truth), since these alone ascribe 
righteousness to faith and not to works? For if faith 
justifies with works, then the whole exposition 


(disputatio) of Paul is false, who clearly says that man is 
not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus 
Christ. 


So Christ would be a servant of sin 


247 Here again a Hebrew way of speaking is used, 
which Paul also uses in 2 Cor. 3, 7-9. There he speaks 
gloriously and most clearly of these two offices 


(ministeriis), namely of the letter and of the spirit, of the 
law and of grace, or of death and of life, and he says that 


Moses, the minister (ministrum) of the law, has the office 
of the law, which he calls the office of sin, of wrath, of 
death and of condemnation. For Paul uses very 
disgraceful names for the law of God, and he alone 
among the apostles speaks in this way; the others do not 
speak in this way. However, it is very useful for those 


who study the Holy Scriptures to record (tenere) this way 
of speaking of Paul. 
But a minister of sin is called nothing else than a 


lawgiver or exactor of the law, who teaches good works 
and love, who teaches that one must bear the cross and 
suffer, that one should follow the example of Christ and 
the saints. Anyone who teaches this and insists on itis a 
servant of the law, sin, wrath and death, because he 
does nothing else with his teaching than to frighten and 
weigh down the consciences, and to resolve them under 
sin. For it is impossible for human nature to fulfill the law; 
indeed, in the justified who have the Holy Spirit, the law 
in the members opposes the law in the mind 2c. [What 
should it not do in the ungodly who do not have the Holy 
Spirit? 


202 Lri.:> 217-219. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1864-1867. 


203 





(249) Therefore, he who teaches that righteousness 
is obtained through the law does not understand what 
he says or what he claims, much less keeps the law, but 
deceives himself and others and burdens them with an 
unbearable burden, teaches and demands the 
impossible, and finally leads himself and his disciples 
into despair. 

The very custom and purpose of the law, therefore, 
is that it may convict men, who live quietly and securely, 
of their guilt, that they may be guilty of sin, wrath, and 
death, that they may be terrified, despair, despondency, 
and fear of a rushing leaf. And inasmuch as they are so 
constituted, they are under the law. For the law demands 
perfect obedience to God, and condemns those who do 
not render the same. But it is obvious that no one does 
or can do this perfect obedience to the law, which God 
nevertheless strictly demands. Therefore the law does 
not justify, but condemns, as it is written [Deut. 27, 26. 
Gal. 3, 10.]: "Cursed be everyone who does not remain 
in all this" 2c. Therefore, he who teaches the law is a sin- 
servant. 

Therefore Paul rightly calls the office of the law an 
office of sin in 2 Cor. 3, 9. 1) For the law indicates sin, 
which without the law is dead [Rom. 7, 8]. But the 
knowledge of sin (which is not only in thoughts 
[speculativa], as with the hypocrites, but the right one, 
in which one recognizes the wrath of God over sin and 
in truth tastes and feels death) frightens the hearts, 
drives to despair and kills, Rom. 7, 11. 

Therefore, these teachers of the law and works, 
whom the Scriptures call "drivers" and "tyrants" [Isa. 9:4, 
49:7] (for just as those drivers in Egypt burdened the 
children of Israel with physical bondage, so these bring 
souls into spiritual and exceedingly miserable bondage 
through the teaching of the law and works, and finally 
drive them into despair and corrupt them), neither 
recognize themselves, nor feel 


1) In the quoted passage it says: "The ministry that 
preaches condemnation", namely because of sin. 


The power of the law, nor is it possible for them to attain 
peace of conscience in right: The terror of the 
conscience and the peace of the conscience in the 
distress of death, even though they have kept the law, 
shown love, done many good works, and suffered many 
evils. For the law always terrifies them and accuses 
them, saying, "You have never done all that is 
commanded in the law, but cursed is he who has not 
done fall]." 2c. Therefore, this terror remains and 
gradually becomes stronger and stronger, and if such 
teachers of the law are not straightened out by faith and 
the righteousness of Christ, they must despair. 

253 There is a remarkable example of this in the "Life 
Descriptions of the Fathers" by a hermit. 2) A short time 
before he died, he stood sadly and motionless for three 
days with his eyes turned toward heaven. When he was 
asked why he was doing this, he said that he feared 
death. When his disciples comforted him that he had no 
reason to fear death because he had lived a very holy 
life, he replied: "I have lived a holy life and kept God's 
commandments, but God's judgments are very different 
from those of men. When he saw death before his eyes, 
he could not satisfy his heart, even though he had lived 
blamelessly and kept the law of God, because it 
occurred to him that God judges very differently from 
men, and so he lost confidence in all his good works and 
merits, and fell into despair when he was not raised up 
by the promise of Christ. 

Therefore, the law can do nothing but strip us naked 
and present us as guilty. There is then no help nor 
counsel, but all is lost. Here the life and the tortures of 
all the saints cannot help us. This is also beautifully 
illustrated in the history of the legislation 2 Mos. 19, 16- 
18. and 20, 18. f. Moses led the people out of the camp 
to meet God, so that they would hear God speak from 
the dark cloud. Then the people, who had promised 
shortly before that they would do everything that God 
would command, drew back in fear and trembling, stood

from afar and said to Moses, "Who can hear the fire, and 
the thunder, and the sound of the trumpet? "Speak thou 
with us, and we will obey; and let not God speak with us, 
lest we die." 

The actual function of the law is to lead us out of our 
camp, that is, out of peace and trust in ourselves, and to 
bring us before the face of God and reveal His wrath to 
us. Then the conscience realizes that it has not done 
enough for the law, nor can it do enough, nor can it bear 
the wrath of God that the law reveals; when it thus brings 
us before God's face, that is, when it terrifies, accuses 
and exposes sin, it is impossible for us to stand. 
Therefore we flee in terror and cry out with Israel: We 
must die, we must die! The Lord do not speak to us, you 
speak to us 2c. 

Whoever therefore teaches that faith in Christ does 
not justify unless the law is kept at the same time, makes 
Christ a minister of sin, that is, a teacher of the law, who 
teaches the same as Moses. Thus Christ cannot be a 
savior nor a dispenser of grace, but a cruel tyrant who, 
like Moses, demands impossible things that no one can 
accomplish. Thus all those who deal in their own 


righteousness (justitiarii) hold that Christ is a new 
lawgiver, and pass the judgment that the Gospel is 
nothing but a book containing new laws of works, as the 
Turks dream of their Alkoran. But in Mosi's books there 
are enough laws. Therefore the gospel is a preaching of 
Christ, that he forgives sins, gives grace, and makes 
sinners righteous and blessed. But that there are 
commandments in the Gospel, they are not Gospel, but 


interpretations of the law and appendices of the Gospel. 

Furthermore, if the law is an office of sin, then it 
follows that it is also an office of wrath and death, 
because the law, as it exposes sin, so also terrifies man, 
reveals the wrath of God, and puts terror of death into 
him. For the conscience immediately concludes thus: 
You have not kept the commandments, so God is 
offended and 


is angry with you, and this is the inevitable conclusion: | 
have sinned, therefore | must die. Thus, according to the 


correct conclusion (per consequens), the office of sin is 
also an office of God's wrath and death. For when sin is 
revealed, wrath, death and damnation immediately 
follow. For thus the conscience concludes: You have 
sinned, so God is angry with you; but if he is angry, he 
will kill you and condemn you eternally. And hence it is 
that many who cannot bear the wrath and judgment of 
God, which are made known by the law, kill themselves, 
cut their necks, or drown themselves 2c. 


That is far away. 

258 As if he wanted to say: Christ is not a servant of 
sin, but he gives righteousness and eternal life. That is 
why Paul separates Christ from Moses by a long way. 
Moses should therefore remain on earth, be a teacher of 
the letter and a lawgiver, and crucify sinners. But the 
believers, Paul says, have another teacher in their 
conscience, not Moses, but Christ, who has abolished 
the law, overcome sin, wrath and death 1) and abolished 
them. He calls us, who are weary and burdened with all 
evil, to come to him. Therefore, when we flee to him, 
Moses disappears with his law, so that his grave is 
nowhere to be seen, and sin and death can no longer 
harm us. For Christ our teacher is the Lord of law, sin 
and death; he who believes in him is free from these. So 
itis the real ministry of Christ to free from sins and death, 
which Paul teaches and inculcates without ceasing. 

And so we are condemned and put to death by the 
law, but justified and made alive by Christ. The law 
frightens us and drives us away from God, but Christ 
reconciles us to God and makes it possible for us to have 
access to him. For he is the Lamb of God who bears the 
sin of the world. Therefore, whoever believes in Christ 
has him who took away the sin of the world. If the sin

206 Lii. 6ai. 1, 221-224. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1870-1873. 


207 





If sin is taken away from the world, it is also taken away 
from me who believe in him. But if sin is taken away, then 
wrath, death and condemnation are also taken away, 
and righteousness has taken the place of sin, 
reconciliation and grace have taken the place of wrath, 
life has taken the place of death, and eternal 
blessedness has taken the place of condemnation. 

260 We should not only learn to speak this difference 
in words, but also to put it into practice and life out of a 
living conviction of the heart. For where Christ is, there 
must also be a calm and happy conscience. For Christ is 
our reconciliation, righteousness, peace, life and 
blessedness; in short, everything that a poor and 
shattered conscience seeks, it finds abundantly in Christ. 
Paul makes further use of this reason for proof and 
convinces them: 


V. 18 But if I build again that which I have broken, 
I make myself a transgressor. 


261 As if to say, | have not preached in such a way 
that | would do again what | once broke. For if | did so, | 
would not only labor in vain, but would make myself a 
transgressor, and, as the false apostles are wont to do, 
would pervert all things; that is, | would turn grace and 
Christ into a law and Moses, and vice versa, the law and 
Moses into grace and Christ. But | have broken sin, 
sorrow, wrath and death by the ministry of the gospel. 
For | have taught thus: Your conscience, O man, is 
subject to law, sin, and death; from which you cannot be 
freed by the power of any man or angel. But now the 
gospel comes and proclaims to you forgiveness of sins 
through Christ, who has done away with the law and has 
destroyed sin and death. Believe in Him, and you will be 
set free from the curse of the law, from the tyranny of sin 
and death, and you will be justified and have eternal life. 


1) Instead of vivis, the Wittenberg has: unius. 


Thus | have broken the law through the preaching of 
the gospel, so that it can no longer remain in the 
conscience. For since the new householder, Christ, 
comes into the new house to dwell therein alone, the old 
inhabitant, Moses, must depart and go elsewhere. But 
where Christ is the new host, there the law, sin, wrath, 
and death have no place, but there is only grace, 
righteousness, joy, life, and nothing but childlike 
confidence in the reconciled, favorable, and gracious 
Father for Christ's sake. Should | then cast out Christ and 
destroy his kingdom, which | planted through the gospel, 
and again build up the law and establish Moses' 
kingdom? This would happen if | taught, as the false 
apostles do, that circumcision and the keeping of the law 
are necessary for salvation. And in this way, instead of 
righteousness and life, | would again establish sin and 
death. For the law only exposes sin, incites wrath and 
kills. 

Dear, what are the papists, when they are at their 
best, but destroyers of the kingdom of Christ and builders 
of the kingdom of the devil, of sin, of the wrath of God, 
and of eternal death? They destroy the church, which is 
the building of God, not with the law of Moses, as the 
false apostles do, but with the statutes of men and the 
teachings of the devils. So do the spirits of the swarm, 
who are already here today, and those who will come 
after us: they destroy and will destroy what we have built, 
and rebuild and will rebuild anew what we have 
destroyed. 

But we, who by God's grace hold fast the article of 
justification, know most definitely that we are justified by 
faith alone in Christ alone. Therefore, we do not confuse 
law and grace, faith and works, but keep them very far 
apart. This distinction between the law and grace should 
be carefully observed by everyone who strives for 
godliness, and it should be given its due weight, not only 
in letters and syllables, but in application, so that when 
he hears that one must do good works, he may

209 





He must follow Christ's example, he can judge rightly and 
say: Quite right, | will gladly do that. What else? Then you 
will be blessed. No; | admit that one should do all good, 
suffer all evil, even shed one's blood, if the cause, for 
Christ's sake, so requires, but by this | am not justified, 
nor do | attain blessedness. 

Therefore, it is not necessary to include good works 
in the article of justification, as the monks did, who said 
that not only good works are deserving of eternal life, but 
also the punishments and executions inflicted on wicked 
wicked men for their misdeeds. For they have been so 
comforted when the death penalty should now be carried 
out on them: Suffer willingly this shameful death; if you 
do so, you will earn forgiveness of sins and eternal life. 

It is a frightening thing that a poor thief, murderer, or 
robber, in his greatest fear, should be seduced in such a 
way that, at the moment when he must die, when he is 
about to be hanged or beheaded, nothing is said to him 
about the Gospel of Christ, which alone can comfort and 
make him blessed, but he is asked to hope for mercy and 
forgiveness of sins if he willingly suffers the ignominious 
death that will be inflicted on him because of his crimes. 
This really means to hang the greatest misfortune on the| 
neck of someone who is in the greatest suffering and to 
show him the way to hell through this false delusion and 
trust in his own death. 

267 By this those hypocrites sufficiently show that 
they have not taught or understood a single letter of 
grace, of the gospel or of Christ. They have kept the 
name of the gospel or Christ only in pretense, in order to 
deceive the hearts of the simple all the more easily, but 
in fact they have denied Christ altogether and trampled 
Him underfoot, and ascribed more to human statutes 
than to the gospel of Christ. This is evidenced by the so 
many services, so many kinds of orders, so many 
ceremonies, so many works, all of which have been 
instituted in the opinion that they should help to merit 
grace 2c. 





In confession they made no mention of the faith or of 
the merit of Christ, but only inculcated human 
satisfactions and merits, as can be seen in the following 
formula of absolution, not to mention others which the 
monks used among themselves, namely those who 
wanted to be respected for living spiritually in a higher 
degree than others. These | will put here, so that our 
descendants may also recognize the immense and 
unspeakable abomination of the papal empire. 


Formula of absolution of the monks. 


God forgive you, my brother! - May the merit of the 
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the blessed 
Virgin Mary and all the saints, the merit of your order, the 
hard life in the spiritual state, the humility of your 
confession, the repentance in your heart, the good works 
that you have done and will do out of love for our Lord 
Jesus Christ, be sufficient for you to forgive your sins, to 
grow in merit and grace, and to receive eternal life as a 
reward, amen. 

Here you hear the merit of Christ mentioned, but if 
you consider the words a little more carefully, you will see 
that Christ has nothing to do with it, and that the honor 
and the name of a justifier and savior are taken away 
from him, while this is attached to the monastic works. 
Does this not mean that the name of God is used 
uselessly? Is this not confessing Christ in words, but 
denying and blaspheming His power? | have been in the 
same mire; | thought that Christ was a judge (although | 
confessed with my mouth that he suffered and died to 
redeem the human race), who should be pacified by 
keeping my rule. Therefore, when | prayed or said Mass, 
| always added at the end: Lord Jesus, | come to you and 
ask you to accept the difficult service in my order as a 
payment for my sins. 

But now | give thanks to the Father of mercies, who 
has brought me out of darkness.

has called me to the light of the gospel and gifted me 
with an exceedingly rich knowledge of my Lord Jesus 
Christ, for whose sake I, like Paul, count all things as evil 
and count them as filth, that | may gain Christ and be 
found in him [Phil. 3:8, 9], that | may not have my 
righteousness from the rule of Augustine, but that which 
comes through faith in Christ 2c. To whom be praise and 
glory, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, for 
ever and ever, Amen. 

272 We conclude with Paul that we are justified by 
faith alone in Christ, without law and works. But after a 
man is justified by faith, and now possesses Christ by 
faith, and knows that he is his righteousness and his life, 
he will certainly not be idle, but will bear good fruit as a 
good tree. For a believing person has the Holy Spirit; 
where He is, He does not let the person be idle, but 
drives him to all exercises in godliness, to love toward 
God, to patience in tribulations, to prayer, to 
thanksgiving, to showing love toward all. 

For this reason we also say that faith without works 
is worthless and useless. This is understood by the 
papists and the enthusiasts to mean that faith without 
works does not justify, or that faith, however righteous, 
is useless unless it has works. This is false; but faith 
without works, that is, a fanciful thought, a mere delusion 
and dream of the heart, is false and does not justify. 

274 So far we have dealt with the first ground of 
proof, by which Paul aims at the fact that either we 
cannot be justified by the law, or Christ must necessarily 
be a minister of sin. But this is impossible; it follows that 
in no way may it be admitted that we are justified by the 
law. We have, however, treated this doctrine in detail, as 
it is proper, although it cannot yet be sufficiently 
impressed and recorded even in this way. 

V. 19. But I died to the law through the law, that I 
might live. 





These are wonderful words and _ unheard-of 
speeches, which human reason does not understand at 
all. And this is spoken briefly, but very emphatically. But 
it is evident that Paul is speaking from a heated, ardent 
spirit and in great zeal, after the manner of a man who 
is very indignant, as if he wanted to say: Why do you 
insist on the law, of which | want to know nothing? Why 
do you so often deafen my ears with it? If one must have 
a law, then | also have a law. 

276 So he calls grace itself a law, as it were out of an 
indignation wrought by the Holy Spirit, calling the work 
of grace (fem gratiae) by a new word, to the shame of 
the law, Most and the false apostles, who claimed that it 
was necessary for justification, and so he sets law 
against law. 

277 And this is a very lovely way of speaking, which 
is exceedingly full of comfort, that in the Scriptures, 
especially in Paul, law is set against law, sin against sin, 
death against death, captivity against captivity, devil 
against devil, hell against hell, altar against altar, lamb 
against lamb, Easter against Easter 2c. Rom. 8, 3.: "He 
condemned sin by sin" 2c.; Ps. 68, 19. and Eph. 4, 8.: 
"He caught the prison.” Hos. 13, 14.: "Death, | will be a 
death 1) to thee; hell, | will be a pestilence to thee." So 
here he says he died to the law through the law, as if to 
say: The law of Moses accuses me and condemns me. 
Against this accusing and condemning law | have 
another law, which is grace and freedom. This accuses 
the accuser and condemns the condemning law. 

?Thus death kills death, but this death that kills death 
is life itself. But he is called the death of death because 
of the exceedingly great unwillingness of the Holy Spirit 
against death. Thus, righteousness puts on the name of 
sin because it condemns sin, and this condemning sin 
is the right righteousness.

VII, 1880-1883. 213 





And here Paul is a heretic above all heretics, and his 
heresy is outrageous, because he says that he who died 
to the law lives GOtte. The false apostles taught: If you 
do not live by the law, you are dead to God, that is, if you 
do not live by the law, you are dead to God. Paul says 
just the opposite: If you have not died to the law, you 
cannot live to God. Our adversaries today have the same 
teaching that the false apostles had at that time. They 
say: If you want to live according to the law, then live 
according to the law. We, on the other hand, say: If you 
want to live godly, you must be completely dead to the 
law. Human reason and wisdom cannot grasp this 
doctrine, therefore it constantly teaches the opposite, 
namely: If you want to live right, you must keep the law, 
for it is written: "Do this, and you will live. And this is the 
noblest doctrine and the only principle (maxima) of all 
theologians: He who lives by the law lives GOtte. 

But Paul says something quite different, namely that 
we cannot live if we have not died to the law. Therefore, 
we must rise to this heavenly height, that we have 
certainly died to the law. But if we have died to the law, 
then the law has no right over us, just as it has not the 
slightest right over Christ, who redeemed us from it, so 
that we might live through Him. The purpose of all this is 
that we are not justified by the law, but only by faith in 
Christ. 

But Paul is not talking about the ceremonial law, 
because he sacrificed in the temple, circumcised 
Timothy, circumcised his head in Keuchrea [Acts 21:26, 
16, 3, 18, 18]. He would not have done this if he had died 
to the ceremonial law, but he is talking about the whole 
law. Therefore, for a Christian, the whole law, whether it 
be the ceremonial law or the holy ten commandments, 
has perished, because he has died to it. It is not as if the 
law had perished; rather, it remains, lives, and reigns in 
the ungodly; but a godly man is not subject to the law. 





He died to sin, to the devil, to death, to hell, which 
nevertheless remain, and the wagering and the ungodly 
will keep them. 

Therefore, while a sophist thinks that the law, and the 
ceremonial law at that, has passed away, you, on the 
other hand, hold to the understanding that Paul and 
every Christian was caught up from the law and died, 
and yet the law remains. For example: Since Christ rises 
from death, he is free from the grave, and yet the grave 
remains. Peter is free from prison, the gout-ridden man 
from a fine bed, the young man from his coffin, the 
maiden from her deathbed [Apost. 12, 9. Matth. 9, 6. Luc. 
7, 14. f. 8, 55.], and yet the prison, the bed, the coffin and 
the deathbed remain. So also the law is taken away 
when | am taken away from it; the law dies when | die to 
it, and yet it remains. But because | die to it through 
another law, it also dies to me. Similarly, the tomb of 
Christ, the prison of Peter, the deathbed of the maiden 
2c. remain, and yet Christ dies to the tomb by his 
resurrection, Peter is taken from the prison by his 
deliverance, the maiden is got rid of by the life of the 
deathbed. 

Therefore these words: "I died to the law" are very 
weighty and emphatic. For he does not say: | am free 
from the law for a time, or | am a master of the law, but 
he says par excellence: "| am dead to the law," that is, | 
have nothing at all to do with the law. Paul could not have 
said anything stronger against justification by the law 
than this, since he says, "I died to the law," that is, | do 
not care about the law at all, because | cannot be justified 
by it. 

But "to die to the law" does not mean to be bound by 
the law, but to be free from it and to know nothing of it. 
Therefore, if anyone wants to live before God, let him 
seek to be found apart from the law and come out of the 
grave with Christ. The guardians were astonished when 
Christ rose from the grave, and those who saw the 
maiden being raised were also astonished [Matth. 27, 4 
Marc. 


214 Lri. Kai. i, 230-232. Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1883-1886. 


5, 42.]. So also reason and human wisdom is terrified 
and becomes a fool when it hears that we are not 
justified unless we have first died to the law, because it 
cannot understand this. But we know that when we take 
hold of Christ in faith, as far as conscience is concerned, 
we come under a new law, which swallows up the old 
law that held us captive. Just as that tomb in which Christ 
lay, having died when he was raised, opens and is seen 
empty, and Christ disappears from it, so also | rise with 
Christ when | believe in him, and die to my grave, that 
is, to the law that held me captive, and the law is now 
empty, | have escaped from my prison and grave, that 
is, from the law. Therefore, it now no longer has the right 
to accuse and hold me, because | am resurrected. 

The consciences must be diligently instructed so that 
they learn the article of the difference between 
righteousness by law and righteousness by grace. 

The righteousness of grace or the freedom of 
conscience is of no concern to the flesh. For the flesh 
shall not be free, but shall remain in the grave, in prison, 
on its deathbed; it shall be subject to the law and be 
tormented by the Egyptians. The Christian conscience, 
however, should be dead to the law, that is, free from the 
law, and have nothing to do with it. It is very necessary 
to know this, because it serves to comfort the troubled 
conscience. 

Therefore, when you see a man who is frightened 
and distressed because of the sins of which he is 
conscious, say to him: You do not discern rightly, dear 
brother, you put the law on the conscience, which should 
be put on the flesh. Wake up, straighten up, and 
remember that one must believe in Christ, who 
overcame the law and sin; in this faith you will pass over 
the law and enter into grace, where there is no law and 
no sin; and although law and sin are present, they are 
none of your business, because you have died to the law 
and sins. 





215 


This is easy to say, but to him who understands it well 
in the battle of conscience, that is, who then, when sin 
comes upon him and the law accuses and terrifies him, 
could say: What is it to me that you, Law, accuse me, 
that you convict me of having committed many sins? 
Yes, | still commit many sins daily; that is none of my 
business, | am now deaf, | do not hear you, therefore 
you are telling a story to a deaf man, because | have 
died to you. But if you really want to dispute with me 
about sins, go to my flesh and my members, my 
servants; instruct them, afflict them and crucify them. But 
thou shalt not trouble my conscience, the Lord and King, 
for | have nothing to do with thee. For | died to you, and 
now live in Christ, where | am in another law, that of 
grace, which rules over sin and over the law. By what? 
Through faith in Christ, as Paul indicates below. 

But this is a strange and outrageous saying, that "to 
live by the law" is as much as to die by it, and "to die by 
the law" is as much as to live by it. These two sentences 
are highly repugnant to reason, therefore no sophist or 
teacher of the law (legista) understands them. But you 
learn to understand them correctly. He who lives by the 
law, that is, he who seeks to be justified by the works of 
the law, is and remains a sinner, therefore he is dead 
and condemned. For the law cannot justify and make 
blessed, but accuses, terrifies and kills him. So "to live 
by the law" is to die, and again, "to die by the law" is to 
live. Therefore, if you want to live GOtte, you must die to 
the law, but if you will live to the law, you will have died 
to GOtte. But to "live unto the law" is to be justified by 
grace, or by faith for Christ's sake, without law and 
without works. 

290 Therefore, a Christian, if one wants to describe 
him properly and clearly, is a child of grace and 
forgiveness of sins, who0 has absolutely no law, but is 
above

over sin, death and hell. And just as Christ is free from 
the grave, Peter free from prison, so a Christian is free 
from the law, and just as the relationship of Christ risen 
from the grave and Peter freed from prison is to the 
grave and prison, so is the relation of a conscience 
justified by faith to the law, and just as Christ, by his 
death and resurrection, dies to the grave, so that it no 
longer has any right over him, nor can it keep him, but 
he, since the stone and seal 2c. and the guardians were 
terrified, he rises and goes away free, and Peter, 
through his deliverance, dies to the prison and goes 
away wherever he wants, so the conscience is freed 
from the law through grace. 

So is every one that is born of the spirit, but the flesh 
knoweth not whence this cometh, or whither it goeth, for 
it can only judge according to the law. The spirit, on the 
other hand, says: "The law may accuse me, sin and 
death may frighten me, but | do not despair, because | 
have law against law, sin against sin and death against 
death. 

Therefore, when | feel the biting of conscience 
because of sin, | look at the serpent of brass, Christ on 
the cross. There | find another sin against my sin, which 
accuses me and wants to devour me. But this other sin, 
namely in the flesh of Christ, which takes away the sin 
of the whole world, is almighty, condemns and devours 
my sin. Thus my sin, lest it should accuse and condemn 
me, is condemned by sin [Rom. 8:3.], that is, by Christ 
crucified, "who was made sin for us, that we might 
become in him the righteousness that is before God" [2 
Cor. 5:21.]. So | find death in my flesh, which beats me 
and kills me, but | have a death against this death, which 
is the death of my death; the same crucifies and 
devours. 

All this is not through the law or works, but through 
Christ crucified, on whose shoulders rests all the evils of 
the human race, law, sin, death, devil, hell, all of which 
die in him, 





217 


because he kills them by his death. But we must grasp 
this benefit of Christ with firm faith, for as neither the law 
nor any work but Christ alone is offered to us, so nothing 
else is required of us but faith, which is to grasp and 
believe that my sin and death have been condemned 
and taken away in the sin and death of Christ. 

294 Thus we always have certain reasons for proof, 
from which it must be concluded that faith alone justifies. 
For how could the law and works contribute to 


justification, since Paul argues (agat) against the law and 
works and clearly says that we must have died to the law 
if we want to live? But if we have died to the law, and the 
law has died to us, then surely it has nothing to do with 
us. How, then, should it contribute to justification? 
Therefore, it must be said that we are declared righteous 
by grace or faith in Christ alone, without law and works. 

The blind sophists do not understand this, therefore 
they dream that faith does not justify unless it does 
works of love. In this way, faith that believes in Christ 
becomes idle and futile, because it is deprived of the 
power to justify if it has not received its proper form 
through love (formata caritate). 

But you now set aside the law and love to another 
place and time, and turn your attention to the matter at 
hand. This is the matter of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
dying on the cross, bearing my sin in his body, the law, 
death, the devil and hell. These insurmountable enemies 
and tyrants press me and trouble me now, therefore | am 
troubled how to become free from them, righteous and 
blessed. Here | find no law, no work, no love that could 
set me free from them, but Christ alone takes away the 
law, kills my sin, destroys my death in his body, and in 
this way he makes hell empty, judges the devil, crucifies 
him, and pushes him into hell; in short, everything that 
previously crucified and oppressed me 


218 Lri. Oai. 1, 235-237. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VII/, 1889-1893. 


219 





Christ has "done this out of the means, stripped them, 
made a public display of them, and made a triumph of 
them through Himself" [Col. 2:14, 15], so that from now 
on they can no longer rule over me, but must serve me. 

From this it can be sufficiently understood that 
nothing must be done here but to hear that this has 
happened and to grasp it with undoubted faith, and this 
is in truth the rightly formed faith (fides formata). After 
that, if | have taken hold of Christ through faith 1) and 
have died to the law, justified from sin and through Christ 
freed from death, the devil and hell, then | do good 
works, love God, thank Him, show love to my neighbor. 
But this love or the following works neither give my faith 
its proper form nor do they adorn it, but my faith gives 
love its proper form and adorns it. This is our theology, 
and it is a strange, absurd and paradoxical thing in the 
sight of reason that | am not only blind and deaf to the 
law, and free from it, but completely dead to it. 

But this saying of Paul, "I died to the law through the 
law," is exceedingly full of comfort. If this consolation 
could come to a man at the right time and be firmly fixed 
in his heart with the right understanding, he would be 
able to stand strong against all the dangers of death, 
against the terrors of conscience and sin, no matter how 
much they assailed him, accused him, and wanted to 
bring him to despair. Surely every one is tempted, if not 
in life, yet in death. When the law accuses and exposes 
the sin, then 2) the conscience immediately says: You 
have sinned. 

If you then hold what Paul teaches here, you can 
answer: It is true, | have sinned. - So God will punish and 
condemn you. - No. - Yes the law of God says this. - | 
have nothing to do with this law. - Why? -Because | have 
another law, which this law 


1) Uas is missing in the Wittenberger. 
2) Erlanger: aisut instead of aistut. 





forces to fall silent, namely freedom. - What freedom? - 
Christ's. For through Christ | am made free from the law. 
Therefore the law, which is and remains a law for the 
ungodly, 3) is no law for me, but my law is freedom and 
binds the law that condemns me, and so the law that 
bound me and held me captive is already bound and 
held captive by grace or freedom, which is now my law. 
From this that law which accuses me hears, Thou shalt 
not bind this man unto me, nor hold him captive, nor 
accuse him; but | will hold thee captive, and bind thy 
hands, that thou mayest not hurt him, because now he 
liveth unto Christ, and is dead unto thee. 

(300) That is, to strike out the teeth of the law, to blunt 
its sting and all its weapons, and to take away its power 
altogether. Nevertheless, it remains a law for the ungodly 
and unbelievers, and it also remains for us weak ones, 
as far as we do not believe; there it still has its sharpness 
and its teeth. But if | believe in Christ, however much sin 
tries to plunge me into despair, | still speak in confidence 
of this freedom which | have in Christ: | confess that | 
have sinned, but my sin, which is a damnable sin, is on 
Christ, who is the damnable sin. But the condemning sin 
is stronger than the condemned sin, because it is the 
justifying grace, righteousness, life and blessedness. 

Likewise, when | feel the terror of death, | say: | have 
nothing to do with you, death, because | have another 
death that kills you, my death; but the death that kills is 
stronger than the death that is killed. 

302) Thus, the believer can only be uplifted by faith 
and take a certain and firm comfort, so that he will not 
pale in the face of sin, death, the devil and all evil, and 
no matter how much the devil storms against him with all 
his impetuosity.

and wants to shower him with the terror of the whole 
world, yet in the midst of this terror he sits hope and says: 
Lord Satan, your threats and terrors do not move me, for 
there is One called Jesus Christ in whom | believe. He 
has done away with the law, condemned sin, destroyed 
death, broken hell, and he is, Satan, your Satan. For he 
has taken you captive and bound you, so that you can 
no longer harm me or anyone who believes in him. This 
faith the devil cannot overcome, but is overcome by it, 
for "our faith," says John, "is the victory which overcomes 
the world. But who is he that overcometh the world, 
except he that believeth that JEsus is the Son of GOD?" 
[1 John 5:4, 5.] 

Thus, in a great zeal and indignation of the Holy 
Spirit, Paul calls grace itself a law, while in truth it is 
nothing other than the supreme and immeasurable 
freedom of grace that we have in Christ. Then, for our 
consolation, he also gives the law this disgraceful name, 
so that we know that it is now baptized with a new name, 
that it is no longer alive, but dead and condemned, and 
(this is a very lovely spectacle) he presents the law and 
performs it, as it were, as a thief or robber who has 
already been condemned and sentenced to death. For 


by representing the law as a person (per proso- 


popoeian), he describes how it is held captive, how its 
hands and feet are already bound and all power is taken 
from it, so that it can no longer exercise its tyranny, that 
is, can no longer accuse and condemn; and by this 
exceedingly lovely painting he makes it contemptible 
before the conscience, so that he who believes in Christ 
now also dares in a holy pride to defy the law in this way: 
| am a sinner; if you, law, are able to do something 
against me, do it! So much is lacking that the law should 
still frighten the believer. 

304 Since Christ had risen from death, why should 
he still be terrified before the grave? After Peter was 
released from prison 





was freed, why should he fear it? The maiden might have 
feared her bed of rest when she was dying, but now that 
she was raised again, why should she fear it? So also a 
Christian who truly possesses Christ by faith: why should 
he fear the law? 

A Christian, though he feels the terror of the law, is 
not overcome by it, but, trusting in the freedom which he 
has in Christ, he says: | hear, O law, that thou 
murmurest, that thou wilt accuse and condemn me, but 
this does not move me; thou art as much to me as the 
empty tomb was to Christ. For | see that thou art bound 
and tied hand and foot, which my law hath bound thee. 
What is this law? The freedom that is called a law, not 
because it binds me, but because it binds my law. The 
law of the Ten Commandments bound me; against it | 
now have another law, namely the law of grace, which is 
not a law for me, nor does it bind me, but makes me free. 
But it is a law against the condemning law; this is bound 
by it, so that it can no longer bind me. 

306 So | also have another death against the death 
that binds me, namely the life that makes alive in Christ, 
and this death releases me and frees me from the bonds 
of my death, and binds him himself with it. So the death 
that bound me is now bound, he who wanted to kill me is 
now killed by this death, that is, by the true life. 

'Thus Christ is called by the sweetest names: My law, 
my sin, my death against the law, sin and death, since in 
truth he is nothing other than pure freedom, 
righteousness, life and eternal bliss. Therefore he 
became a law for the law, a sin for sin, a death for death, 
that he might redeem me from the curse of the law 2c. 
and make me righteous and alive. Thus Christ is twofold: 
while he is law, he is liberty; while he is sin, he is 
righteousness; while he is sin, he is righteousness.

chapter of the Tischreden. In our edition of the Table Talks, it has

223 








While he is death, he is life. For just by allowing himself 
to be accused by the law, condemned by sin, devoured 
by death, he has done away with the law, condemned 
sin, destroyed death, and made me righteous and 
blessed. Thus Christ is both the poison against the law, 
sin and death, and the medicine to obtain freedom, 
righteousness and eternal life. 

This quite Pauline way of thinking and speaking is 
very sweet and comforting. Thus he contrasts the law in 
the mind with the law in the members, Rom. 7, 23. 
Because this is spoken in a new and strange way 
(mirabiliter), it enters the heart more easily and remains 
more firmly in the memory. Then it is also more lovely 
when he says: "I died to the law through the law", than if 
he had said: "I died to the law through freedom: | died to 
the law through freedom. He holds up a kind of painting, 
as if one law were fighting against another law, as if to 
say: Law, if you can accuse, terrify and bind me, | will 
set another law over you, that is, another tyrant and 
tormentor, who shall in turn accuse, bind and oppress 
you. You are indeed my tormentor, but | have another 
tormentor, Christ, who will torment you; but if you are 
tormented by him, | am free through him. Likewise, if the 
devil torment me, | have a stronger devil who torments 
him again 1) and overcomes him. So grace is a law, not 
for me, for it does not bind me, but for my law, which it 
binds so that it can no longer bind me. 

Therefore Paul would like to withdraw us completely 
from the law, sin, death and all evil, so that we no longer 
look at them, and would like to lead us to Christ, so that 
we there look at the most beautiful duel, namely that the 
law fights against the law, so that | may be free; sin 
against sin, so that | may be righteous; death against 
death, so that | may have life; that Christ may be my 
devil against the devil, so that | may be God's child; that 
he may destroy hell, so that | may have the kingdom of 
heaven.

That I may live GOtte. 


That is, so that | may be alive before God. So you see 
that there can be no life if you are not without law, yes, if 
you are not completely dead to the law, namely in 
conscience. But in the meantime, as long as the body 
lives, the flesh, as | have often reminded you, must be 
exercised by laws and be afflicted by the doings and 
punishments of laws. But the inward man, who owes 
nothing to the law, but rather is free from it, is a living, 
righteous, and holy person, not by himself or in his being, 
but in Christ, because he believes in him, as follows: 


I am crucified with Christ. 


He adds this because he wants to describe the law 
that devours the law. He says: "I did not die to the law 
through the law alone, so that | might live, but | was also 
crucified with Christ. But Christ is the Lord of the law, 
because he was crucified to the law and died, therefore 
| also am a Lord of the law. For | also was crucified to the 
law and died, because | was crucified with Christ and 
died with him. By what? Through grace and faith. Since 
through this faith | am crucified to the law and die, it loses 
all right to me, just as it lost its right to Christ. Therefore, 
just as Christ himself was crucified to the law, to sin, to 
death, to the devil, so that they no longer have any right 
to him, so | also, through faith, am crucified in spirit with 
Christ, crucified to the law, to sin, 2c. and die to them, so 
that they also no longer have any right to me, but are 
crucified to me and have died. 

312 Paul does not speak here of the crucifixion, 
which consists of following him or imitating his example, 
because to follow the example of Christ also means to

of which it is said in 1 Pet 2:21: "Christ suffered for us

footsteps", but he speaks here of the sublime

Crucifixion, by which sin, the devil, death is crucified in 
Christ, not in me. Here Christ does all things alone, but, 
believing, | am crucified with Christ through faith, so that 
sin, death 2c. are also dead and crucified to me. 


V. 20. But I am alive. 


He speaks clearly and actually. He says: "I do not 
speak of my death and crucifixion as if | were no longer 
alive, but rather | am alive, because through this death 
and crucifixion, by which | die, | am made alive, that is, 
because through grace and faith | am freed from the law, 
from sin and from death, so | truly live. Therefore, 
crucifixion and death, by which | am crucified and die to 
the law, sin, death and all evil, is resurrection and life to 
me. For Christ crucifies the devil, kills death, condemns 
sin, and binds the law; believing this, | am freed from the 
law 2c. So the law is powerless, bound, dead and 
crucified to me, and again, | am powerless, bound, dead 
and crucified to the law. So | live just by this death and 
crucifixion, that is, just by this grace or freedom. 

Here, however, as | have already reminded you 
above, the Pauline way of speaking is to be noted, 
namely, that he says that we die to the law and are 
crucified to it, while the law rather dies to us and is 
crucified. But he uses this expression on purpose, that 
we are crucified to the law and have died, so that the 
speech is more sweet. For the law, which otherwise 
remains, lives and reigns in the whole world, which 
accuses and condemns all men, is crucified and dies for 
those alone who believe in Christ. Therefore they alone 
have this honor, that they have been crucified and died 
to the law, to sin 2c. 


But now not me. 


315 That is, not in my person or in my being. He 
clearly shows how he lives and teaches what Christian 
righteousness is. 





It is the one through which Christ lives in us, not the one 
that is in our person. Therefore, if we are to speak of 
Christian righteousness, the person must be set aside 
altogether. For if | cling to the person or speak of him, 
the person becomes a work-saint who is subject to the 
law, whether | like it or not. But here Christ and my 
conscience must become One Body, so that | keep 
nothing else before my eyes but the crucified and 
resurrected Christ. But if | only look at myself and 
exclude Christ, then it is all over for me. For then this 
thought immediately comes to my mind: Christ is in 
heaven, you are on earth; in what way can you come to 
him? | will live holy and do what the law requires, and so 
| will enter into life. If | now turn to myself and look at 
myself as | am or should be, as well as what | should do, 
| lose sight of Christ, who alone is my righteousness and 
my life. When | have lost this, there is no more counsel 
or help, but despair and damnation must inevitably 
follow. 

316 And this evil is a very general one, for this is the 
misfortune of men, that when we are in temptation or in 
mortal peril, we soon forsake Christ, and look upon our 
life and doings. If we are not raised up by faith here, we 
must perish. Therefore we must get used to the fact that 
in such struggles of the conscience we let go of 
ourselves, the law and the works, which only drive us to 
look at ourselves, and turn our eyes straight to the 
brazen serpent, namely to Christ, who is nailed to the 
cross, and, clinging to him with unwavering gaze, 
certainly believe that he is our righteousness and our life, 
and do not care about the threats and terrors of the law, 
of sin, of death, of the wrath and judgment of God. For 
Christ, to whom we cling unwaveringly and firmly, in 
whom we are, and who lives in us, is the victor and the 
Lord over law, sin, death and all evil; in him we are 
offered a certain comfort and given victory.

person of Christ and your person, then you are under the 
law and remain under it, and live in yourself, not in Christ, 
which is nothing else than to be condemned by the law 
1) and to be dead before God, because you have such 
a faith, as the Sophists speak of it in their ludicrous way, 
which has been formed by love (informatam caritate). 

322 Thus | speak for the sake of the example. For no 
one can be shown to have been saved by this faith. 
Therefore, what the Sophists have taught about faith 
formed by love is nothing but the devil's folly. However, 
we admit that a man can be found who has such faith, 
but if he has it, he is not righteous, because he only has 
the historical faith of Christ, which the devil and all the 
ungodly also have [Jac. 2:19]. 

For this reason faith must be taught purely, namely, 
that through it you may be so closely united with Christ 
that you and he may become, as it were, one person, 
who cannot be separated from him, but constantly cling 
to him, so that you may confidently say: | am Christ, that 
is, Christ's righteousness, victory, life 2c. is mine; and 
Christ in turn says: | am that sinner, that is, his sins, 
death 2c. are mine, because he is attached to me, and | 
to him, because we are joined by faith to one flesh and 
one bones, Eph. 5, 30.: "We are members of the body of 
Christ, of his flesh and of his bones", so that this faith 
joins Christ and me more closely than a husband is 
joined to his wife. Therefore this faith is not an idle quality 
(qualitas), but its greatness is so tremendous that it 
obscures the quite foolish dreams of the sophistical 
doctrine, and completely annuls what they invent of faith 
formed by love, of merits, of our worthiness or quality 2c. 
| would like to elaborate on this if | could. 

So far we have indicated that this was Paul's first 
reason for proving that either Christ must necessarily be 
a sin minister, or that the Law must be a sin minister. 


1) Wittenberger: dnnannrk instead of: danannri. 





could not justify. After Paul had given this proof, he set 
himself up as an example, made a kind of personal 
poetry, and said that he had died to the old law by a new 


law. Now he adds two QV@UTTO@OPAC, 2) that is, pleas 
of the opp. 
The first refutation is directed against the slander of 
proud spirits and the annoyance of the weak. 3) The first 
refutation is directed against the slander of proud spirits 
and the anger of the weak. For when forgiveness of sins 
by grace is preached, wicked people immediately 
slander this preaching, saying, as Rom. 3:8, "Let us do 
evil, that good may come of it." For as soon as such 
people hear that we are not justified by the law, they 
immediately draw this slanderous conclusion: So let us 
leave the law in place. Likewise: If grace is made 
mightier where sin is made mightier [Rom. 5:20], let us 
therefore commit many sins, that we may be justified, 
and that grace may be made mightier. These are 
malicious and hopeful people who like to pervert the holy 
scriptures and the sayings of the Holy Spirit, as they also 
perverted the writings of Paul to their own condemnation 
when the apostles were still alive, as 2 Petr. 3:16 says. 

(325) Then the weak also, who are not malicious, as 
the slanderers, but good men, are vexed, when they hear 
that the law is not to be kept, and that good works are 
not to be done, that they may be justified thereby. These 
must be helped, and it must be explained to them how 
works do not justify, in what way they must be done, and 
in what way they must not be done. But they must be 
done, not as the cause, but as the fruit of righteousness. 
Now that we have become righteous, we must do them, 
not the other way around, so that we as unrighteous may 
become righteous thereby. The tree brings forth the fruit, 
not the fruit the tree. 

Above [v. 19] he had said: "I died" 2c. This could 
easily have been blasohemed by a malicious man: What 
do you say, Paul? You have died? How come

it then that you speak and write? Even a weak person 
could have easily gotten angry: Who are you? Do | not 
see that you live and carry out your ministry? 

He answers: | do live, "yet now not I, but Christ lives 
in me." So there is a twofold life, my natural life or my life 
in the flesh (animalis) and a foreign one, namely the life 
of Christ in me. After my life in the flesh | died and now | 
live a foreign life. | am now no longer living as Paul, but 
Paul has died. Who then lives? The Christian lives. So 
Paul, as he lives in himself, is completely dead by the 
law, but as in Christ, or rather, as Christ lives in him, he 
lives in a foreign life, because Christ speaks, works, and 
performs all actions in him. This now no longer belongs 
to the life of Paul, but to the life of the Christian. 

328 Therefore you, wicked one, should not now 
blaspheme that | have said | am dead, nor you. Weak 
one, vex thee; but discern aright: because life is twofold, 
mine is another. | do not live according to my life, 
otherwise the law would rule over me and hold me 
captive. So that it cannot hold me, | have died to it 
through another law, and this death gives me a foreign 
life, namely the life of Christ, which is not innate to me, 
but given through Christ in faith. 

329 Now follows the second objection with its 
refutation. For one could have further countered Paul: 
What do you say? You do not live in your own life or in 
the flesh, but in Christ? | see your flesh, not Christ. Do 
you, then, want to deceive us with a deceptive work, so 
that we should not see that you are present in the flesh 
and still live in the former life, have five senses and do 
everything that another man does in the bodily life? He 
answers: 


For what I now live in the flesh, I live in the faith 
of the Son of God. 
That means: | live in the flesh, but | do not consider this 
life, which is led in me, however big or small it may be, 
to be a life. For it is not in truth a life, but only a larva. 





231 


of life, under which another lives, namely Christ, who is 
in truth my life, which you do not see, but only hear, as 
you hear the wind blowing, but do not know from where 
it comes or where it goes, John 3:8. So you see that | 
speak, eat, work, sleep 2c., and yet you do not see my 
life, because this time of life that | live, | live in the flesh, 
but | do not live out of the flesh or according to the flesh, 
but in faith, out of faith and according to faith. 

So he does not deny that he lives in the flesh, 
because he does all the works of the natural (animalis) 
man, then also uses bodily things, as food, clothing 2c. 
This certainly means living in the flesh. But he says that 
this is not his life, nor does he live according to 


(secundum) these things. He uses bodily (carnalibus) 
things, but he does not live for them, as the world lives 
from the flesh and after the flesh, because it neither 
knows nor hopes for another life apart from this bodily 
life. 

Therefore he says: This life, however great or small, 
which | live in the flesh, | live in the faith of the Son of 
God, because this word, which | speak in the flesh, is a 
word, not of the flesh, but of the Holy Spirit and of Christ. 
The seeing (visus) that enters or comes out of the eyes 
is not of the flesh, that is, my flesh does not rule over it, 
but the Holy Spirit. So my hearing is not of the flesh, 
though it is in the flesh, but it is in and of the Holy Spirit. 

A Christian speaks only chaste, sober, holy and 
godly words, which belong to Christ and serve the glory 
of God and the blessedness of his neighbor. These do 
not come from the flesh, nor are they done according to 
the flesh, and yet they are in the flesh. For | cannot 
teach, pray, give thanks, write, except through these 
instruments of the body (carmis), which are necessary to 
perform such works, and yet these do not come from the 
flesh, nor originate in the flesh, but are given by God and 
revealed from heaven. Thus | look at a female with my 
eyes, but 


232 Lri. ULI. 1, 2S0-2S3. Explanation of Galatians 2, 20 


. Explanation of Galatians 2, 20. W. VIII, 1912-191S. 233 





with chaste sight, not desiring them. This seeing does 
not come from the flesh, although it is in the flesh, for the 
eyes are the bodily instrument for this seeing, but the 
chastity of seeing comes from heaven. 

Thus a Christian uses the world and all creatures, so 
that there is no difference between him and an ungodly 
man. It is the same food, the same clothing, the same 
hearing, seeing and speaking, in everything else the 
same behavior, the same way of life, the same outward 
appearance (as Paul also says of Christ [Phil. 2, 7]: "He 
was found to be like another man"). Nevertheless, there 
is a very big difference, because although | live in the 
flesh, | do not live from myself, but "what | now live in the 
flesh, that | live in the faith of the Son of God. What you 
hear me speak now flows from a different source than 
what you heard from me before. Before his conversion, 
Paul spoke with the same voice and tongue, but the 
voice and tongue was blasphemous at that time, so it 
could speak nothing but blasphemies and abominations 
against Christ and His Church. Afterwards, when he was 
converted, he had the same flesh, tongue and voice that 
he had before, and there was no change at all in them, 
but the voice and tongue thereafter no longer spoke 
blasphemies, but spiritual words, namely thanksgiving 
and praise to God, which came from faith and the Holy 
Spirit. So | live in the flesh, but not from and according to 
the flesh, but in the faith of the Son of God. 

33Z. From this one can understand where this 
strange and spiritual life comes from, which the natural 
man does not hear. For he does not know what this life 
is like; he hears the sound of the wind, but does not know 
where it comes from or where it goes. He hears the voice 
of the spiritual man, knows his face, his manner and 
gesture, but where these words come from, which are 
now no longer blasphemous and predatory as before, 
but holy and divine, where these [spiritual] movements 
and actions come from, he does not see. For this life is 
in the heart through faith, where, after the flesh is killed, 
Christ with his Holy Spirit comes. 


The life of the Son of God is ruled by the Holy Spirit, who 
sees, hears, speaks, works, suffers and, in short, does 
everything in him, even though the flesh resists. In short, 
this life is not a life of the flesh, although it is in the flesh, 
but of Christ, the Son of God, whom the Christian 
possesses by faith. 


Who loved me and gave Himself for me. 


Here you have a description of the right way of 
justification and an example of the certainty of faith. 
Whoever could say these words with Paul: "I live in the 
faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself 
up for me," in certain and constant faith, would be truly 
blessed. And just with these words Paul completely 
abolishes the righteousness of the law and works and 
cancels them, as we will say later. 

These words, "The Son of God loved me and gave 
himself for me," must be carefully considered. From 
them it follows that | have not loved the Son of God, nor 
have | given myself for him, as the sophists invent that 
they love the Son of God and give themselves for him. 
For they teach that a man, by purely natural powers, can 
bring about a merit that must be given to him according 


to equity (meritum congrui), that he can love God and 
Christ above all things. These come before the love of 
God and Christ, because they do as much as is in them, 
become monks, and keep not only the commandments 
of God, but also the counsels, and perform superfluous 
good works (Opera supererogationis), and sell their 
superfluous merits to the laity, and thus give themselves, 
as they dream, for Christ, and thereby make themselves 
and others blessed. 

338 These turn Paul's words, "He who loved me," 2c. 
badly around, and read thus: We have loved Christ and 
given ourselves for him. While these ungodly people, in 
their vain pomposity, which flows from their carnal 
sense, let themselves dream and fool that they do as 
much as is in them, that they love God, that they offer 
themselves for Christ, they destroy in this manner

235 





the gospel, ridicule, deny, blaspheme, spit on Christ and 
trample him underfoot. In words they confess that he is a 
justifier and a beatifier 1) but in deed they take away his 
power to justify and to make blessed and ascribe it to 
their own chosen services. This does not mean living in 
the faith of the Son of God, but in their own righteousness 
and works. 


Which means: A man shall do as much as is in 
him. 

Therefore, this is not the right way to attain 
justification, that you begin to do as much as is in you (for 
the Sophists and scholastic teachers use this way of 
speaking). They say: If aman does as much as is in him, 
then God infallibly gives him grace, and this sentence is 
an article of faith with them. And in order to make it clear 
that they do not understand even a little bit of the 
teaching of Paul and the Gospel, they speak like this: 
This word, "do as much as is in him," need not be 
interpreted most sharply, but it is enough that it be 


understood from the way founded in nature (de medio 


physico), not from the unexceptional (indivisibili) 
mathematical way, which is impossible to attain, that is, 
it is enough if a man does what is sufficient according to 
the judgment of a good man; then grace will surely follow, 
not through merit in equity (merito Congrui) per se, but 
through God's infallible goodness (infallibilitate Dei), 


who is so 2) good and just that he cannot do otherwise 
than give his grace for what is good 2c. And that is where 


this little verse came from: Ultra posse viri non vult 


Deus ulla requiri [God does not require a man to do 
more than he can). 3) This is indeed a good saying, but 
it must be used in the right place, namely, of the things 
that belong to the world and house regiment and of 
purely natural things; as when | am in the realm that is 
subject to reason, 


1) st satvatorsni is missing in the Erlanger. 
2) Wittenberger: Huianm instead of: Hui tarn. 
3) This is how Menius translated this verse. 


If | rule my family, build a house, administer an office of 
authority, and do as much as | can, or as much as is in 
me, then | am excused. This realm has its limits, and that 
is where these sayings really belong: "Do as much as is 
in him", or "do as much as | can". 

(340) The Sophists, on the other hand, draw these 
sayings into the spiritual realm, in which a man can do 
nothing but sin, for "he is sold under sin" [Rom. 7:14]. But 
in those outward things, that is, in those things which 
concern the government of the world and housekeeping, 
man is not a servant, but the master of these bodily 
things. That is why the Sophists acted ungodly by bringing 
into the church these sayings that belong to the world and 
house government. For the realm of human reason is to 
lbe separated from the spiritual realm as far as possible. 


How far the natural powers of man are 
unharmed. 


Furthermore, they have also taught that nature is 
indeed corrupted, but the natural powers are still 
unharmed, and these they also attribute to the devils. On 
this premise they then further concluded: If the natural 
lpowers are unharmed, it follows that the mind is also pure 
land the will good and unharmed, and so consequently 
everything is perfect. It is very useful for you to know this, 
so that the doctrine of faith may be preserved in its purity. 

342 Since the sophists say that the natural powers 
are inviolate, | admit this. But if they conclude from this 
that man can fulfill the law and love God, 2c., | deny the 
conclusion and make a distinction between natural and 
spiritual powers, and say: The spiritual powers are not 
unharmed, but corrupted, yes, completely eradicated by 
sin in man and in the devil, so that there is nothing but a 
corrupted mind and a will that is hostile and opposed to 
the will of God, that thinks nothing but what is against 
God. 

343. that is why the natural forces are indeed 





236 


unharmed, but what natural powers? That man, who is 
drowned in ungodliness and a servant of the devil, has a 
will, reason, free will and the power to build a house, to 
administer a magisterial office, to steer a ship and to 
manage other things that are subject to man, Genesis 
1:28. This is not taken away from man; reproduction, the 
rule of the world, the management of the house are not 
taken away from him, but confirmed by these sayings. 
The Sophists, however, applied them to spiritual things, 
perhaps drawing them from the Fathers, and, not 
understanding them correctly, misapplied them to 
spiritual things, thus confusing the temporal and spiritual 
governments. 

Our task, therefore, is to sweep this out again and to 
remove these aversions from the church. We therefore 
admit that these sayings are true, but only in their place, 
namely in the physical realm. But if one wants to drag 
them into the spiritual realm before God, we deny them 
completely. For here we are completely drowned in sins. 
Everything that is in our will is evil, everything that is in 
our mind is error. Therefore, in divine things, a man has 
nothing but darkness, error, wickedness and falsehood 
in his will and mind. How should he therefore be able to 
work good, to love God 2c.? 

Therefore Paul says here that it was not we who 
made the beginning, but Christ. He says, "He loved me 
and gave himself for me." As if he wanted to say: He did 
not find good will and right mind in me, but Christ had 
mercy on me, he saw that | was ungodly, caught in error, 
turned away from God, and went further and further away 
from Him, and that | was fighting against God, 
imprisoned, ruled and led by the devil. So he loved me 
out of mercy that preceded my reason, my will, my 
understanding, and he loved me so much that he gave 
himself for me, so that | would be freed from the law, from 
sin, from the devil, from death. 

346 Furthermore, these words: "The Son of God", "He 
loved me", and "He gave Himself for me" are all 
thunderbolts and = fire from heaven against 
righteousness. 


Lr-1. 1, 25S-2S7. Executed. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 2:20, W. VIII, 1918-1922. 237 


of the law and the doctrine of works. So great 
wickedness, so great error, darkness and ignorance was 
in my will and mind that | could only be delivered by such 
an unspeakably great ransom. 

347. What then do we boast that our reason guides 


us rightly (de dictamine rationis), that our natural 
powers are unharmed, that our reason is inclined to the 
best, that everyone must do as much as is in him? Why 
do | bring before the angry God, who, as Moses [Deut. 
4:24] says, is a consuming fire, these stubbles of mine, 
yes, my terrible sins, and want to quarrel with Him that 
He should grant me grace and eternal life for them, while 
| hear here that there is so much evil in my nature that 
the world and all creatures have not been sufficient to 
propitiate God, but that God's Son Himself had to be 
offered for this? 

348. But pay careful attention to this ransom, and 
look at this one who is captured and offered "for me", 
namely the Son of God, and you will see that he is 
infinitely greater and more excellent than all creatures. 
What will you do when you hear Paul say that such an 
immeasurably precious ransom has been given for you? 
Will you still come here with your cap and plate, with your 
chastity, obedience and poverty? What is all this? Yes, 
what is the law of Moses and the works of the law? What 
are all the works and all the sufferings of all the martyrs? 
What is all the obedience of the holy angels to the Son 
of God, who was given, and most shamefully given, to 
the death of the cross, so that his most precious blood 
was completely shed for your sins? 

If you were to look at this treasure, you should curse 
all caps, plates, vows, works, merits according to equity 
and merits according to dignity, kick them into the dung, 
spit on them, curse them and cast them into hell. 
Therefore, it is an intolerable and frightening blasphemy 
if you invent any work by which you miss reconciling 
God, seeing that He cannot be reconciled otherwise 
than through this immense and infinite treasure, 


238 


namely through the death and blood of His Son, for one 
drop of His blood is more precious than all creatures. 


For me. 


Who is the "me"? Of course, |, the lost and damned 
sinner, whom the Son of God so loved that he gave 
himself for me. So if | could have loved the Son of God 
by works or by merits of equity or dignity and come to 
him, what would it have taken for him to be offered for 
me? From this it is clear how coldly the papists have 
treated the holy Scriptures and the doctrine of faith, yes, 
how they have neglected them altogether. For if they 
had only considered these words, that the Son of God 
had to be given for me, it would have been impossible 
for any order or sect to arise, because faith would have 
answered immediately: Why do you choose this way of 
life, this order, this work? Is it so that God may be 
reconciled and you may be justified by it? Do you not 
hear, wicked man, that the Son of God was offered for 
you and shed His blood for you? In such a way, faith in 
Christ could easily have resisted all sects. 

For this reason | often say that we have no other 
power or means of resisting the cults than this one article 
of Christian righteousness. If we have lost that, it is 
impossible for us to resist any errors or sects. We can 
see this today in the case of the fanatics, the Anabaptists 
and Sacramentans, who, having fallen away from this 
article, will fall, err and seduce without ceasing, ad 
infinitum, and will undoubtedly create countless sects 
and devise new works. 

But what is all this, even if it seems very good and 
very holy, compared to the blood and death of the Son 
of God, who gave Himself for me? Dear one, look at who 
this Son of God is, how he is constituted, and how great 
he is. What is heaven and earth against him? Rather 
may all papists and instigators of 


1, 257-259. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1922-1925 


239 


Sects with their righteousness, works and merits go to 
hell, even if all the world would adhere to them, than that 
the truth of the gospel should be darkened and the glory 
of Christ should perish. What is it then that works and 
merits are so highly praised? If I, a lost and damned 
sinner, could have been bought by any other ransom, 
what need would there have been for the Son of God to 
be given for me? But because there was no other in 
heaven and on earth than Christ, the Son of God, 
therefore there is the highest necessity that he be given 
for me. Then he did this out of the highest love, for Paul 
says, "He who loved me." 

Therefore these words: "He who loved me" 2c. are 
completely full of faith, and whoever could speak this 
little pronoun "me" in the same faith and apply it to 
himself as Paul, would, just like Paul, be a very good 
disputant against the law. For he [Christ] did not offer a 
sheep, an ox, not gold or silver for me, but all that he 
was, the whole of GOD, that is, himself he offered for 
me, for me, | say, who was the most miserable and 
condemned sinner. So, through this offering of the Son 
of God into death, | breathe again and appropriate Him 
to myself, and this appropriation (applicatio) is the right 
power of faith. Thus, a saint of works does not say: 
"Christ has loved me" 2c. 

These words, which are the purest preaching of 
grace and Christian righteousness, Paul contrasts with 
the righteousness of the law, as if to say: Although the 
law is in truth a divine doctrine and has its honor, yet it 
has not loved me, nor given itself for me; rather, it 
accuses me, terrifies me, and brings me to despair. But 
now | have another who has freed me from the terror of 
the law, from sin and from death, and has set me free, 
into the righteousness of God and into eternal life, who 
is called the Son of God, who loves me and gives 
Himself for me. To Him be glory forever and ever, Amen. 

355. So the belief, as | said, 


240 Li-i. i, 229-261. Exec. Explanation d. Galatians 2, 20 


. W. viii, i-W-E. 241 





grasps and grasps Christ, the Son of God, who was 
given for us, as Paul teaches here; if we have grasped 
him in faith, we have righteousness and life. For Christ is 
the Son of God, who out of pure love gave Himself to 
redeem us. 

And with these words Paul beautifully describes the 
priesthood and the offices of Christ, that is, to reconcile 
God, to represent sinners and pray for them, to give 
himself as a sacrifice for their sins, to redeem them, to 
teach and comfort them. 2c. Therefore, you should 
describe Christ correctly, not as the sophists and 
teachers of works do, who make a new lawgiver out of 
him, who, having done away with the old law, has given 
a new one. To these Christ is a driver and tyrant; but you 
must describe him as Paul does here, that he is the Son 
of God, who gave himself up, not because of any merit 
or righteousness that we have, but out of pure mercy and 
love, and presented himself as a sacrifice to God for us 
poor sinners, that he might sanctify us forever. 

Therefore Christ is not a Moses, not a driver or a 
lawgiver, but a giver of grace, a savior and a merciful 
one, and in short nothing but pure and infinite mercy, 
which is given to us and gives itself to us. In this way you 
paint Christ correctly; if you let Him paint Him differently, 
you will soon fall in the hour of challenge. 

But as this is the highest art of Christians, to be able 
to describe Christ in this way, it is also the most difficult. 
For even I, who have studied it diligently and am well 
trained in it, find it very difficult, even though the gospel 
seems so bright, to describe Christ in the way Paul does 
here. So much has that pernicious teaching and the 
delusion that Christ is a lawgiver penetrated my bones 
like oil. 

You young people are much better off in this matter 
than we old people. For you have not imbibed those 
pernicious opinions which | had been taught from 
childhood, so that | paled with fright when | heard the 
name of Christ merely because | was convinced that he 
was a judge. Therefore 


| have to work in two ways to get rid of this evil; first, to 
forget this old, deeply ingrained opinion of Christ as a 
lawgiver and judge, and to condemn and cast it out, 
because it always comes back and returns to me; 
second, to take the new opinion, that is, the right 
confidence in Christ, that he is a justifier and savior. You 
can, if you only want to, recognize Christ with much 
more ease. 

Therefore, if any sadness or affliction grieves the 
heart, it is not to be attributed to Christ, though it should 
come under Christ's name, but to the devil. The devil 
uses to come under the name of Christ by disguising 
himself as an angel of light [2 Cor. 11:14]. 

Therefore we should learn diligently, not only in word, 
but also in deed and in life, to make a right distinction 
between Christ and a lawgiver, so that when the devil 
comes under the guise of Christ and torments us under 
Christ's name, we may know for certain that it is not 
Christ, but truly the devil. For Christ is joy and sweetness 
to a frightened and anguished heart, as Paul says, who 
adorns Him here with the very sweetest name, namely, 
He who loves me and gives Himself up for me. So Christ 
loves those who are in anguish, in sin and in death, and 
loves us so much that he offers himself for us, becomes 
our high priest, that is, that he places himself as 
mediator between God and us poor sinners. | beg you, 
what could be said that is more lovely or more joyful? If 
this is true, and it must be true, or the whole Gospel 
would be an empty fable, then surely we are not justified 
by the righteousness of the Law, much less by our own 
righteousness. 

Therefore read these words "me", "for me" in such a 
way that you lay great stress on them and get used to 
grasping and appropriating this "me" with certain faith, 
and do not doubt that you belong to the number of those 
of whom this "me" is said; likewise, that Christ not only 
loved Peter and Paul and gave himself up for them, but 
that this grace, which is expressed in the "me 





242 Lri. BHU. 1, 261-2S4. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1929-1933. 


The first thing you must do is to tell them that you are a 
part of us, and that you belong to us as well as to them. 

For as we cannot deny that we are all sinners, and 
must say that Adam corrupted us by his sin, made us 
enemies of God, subjected us to the wrath and judgment 
of God, and made us guilty of eternal death (for this is 
felt and confessed more than is good by frightened 
hearts), so neither can we deny that Christ died for our 
sins that we might be justified. For he did not die to make 
the righteous righteous, but to make sinners righteous, 
friends and children of God, and heirs of all heavenly 
goods. Therefore, since | feel and confess that | am a 
sinner because of Adam's transgression, why should | 
not say that | am righteous because of Christ's 
righteousness, especially since | hear that he loved me 
and gave himself up for me? 

Paul believed this most firmly, therefore he also 
speaks with such great joy of faith (TAnpogopia). This 
also wants us, 


at least to some extent, the very one who loved us and 
gave himself for us, amen. 


V. 21. I do not throw away the grace of God. 


Now he prepares the way for the second reason in 
this epistle. But here you must be careful that wanting to 
be justified by works of the law is as much as throwing 
away the grace of God. Dear, what could be more 
ungodly, or what sin could be more terrible, than to throw 
away God's grace and not want to be justified by faith in 
Christ? Surely it is enough and more than enough that 
we are ungodly and transgressors of all God's 
commandments. Now we also add this sin above all sins, 
that we so surely reject the grace and forgiveness of sins 
offered to us by Christ. Believe me, this blasphemy is 
greater and more terrifying than any man could express 
in words. 

366. Paul and the other apostles did not magnify and 
attack any sin so violently as the contempt of grace and 
the denial of Christ, and yet 





243 


This sin is committed very easily. Especially for this 
reason Paul attacks the Antichrist so harshly, that he 
annuls grace and denies the benefits of Christ, our high 
priest, who gave himself as a sacrifice for our sins. But 
to deny Christ in this way is to spit on him completely 
and trample him underfoot, and to put himself in his 
place and say: | will make you righteous and blessed. By 
what means? By masses, pilgrimages, indulgences, 
keeping the [monastic] rule 2c. 

For this reason, the Antichrist has raised himself 
against and above God and has taken the place of 
Christ, throwing away grace and denying faith. For he 
taught that faith is of no use unless it has works; and by 
this false opinion he completely obscured and destroyed 
the good deeds of Christ, and in place of the grace of 
Christ and his kingdom he established the doctrine of 
works and a kingdom of ceremonies, and fortified it with 
nothing but foolish works, and thus tore the whole world 
away from Christ, who alone should work and reign in 
the conscience, and forcibly thrust it into hell. 

From this it can be sufficiently understood what it is 
to throw away the grace of God, namely, if one wants to 
attain righteousness from the law. But who has ever 
heard that by keeping the law we throw away grace? Do 
we sin, then, by keeping the law? No. But then we throw 
away grace when we keep the law thinking that by doing 
so we will become righteous. The law is good, holy and 
useful, but it does not justify. 

Therefore, whoever keeps the law and claims that he 
wants to be justified by it, throws away grace, denies 
Christ and his sacrifice, and does not want to be saved 
by this inestimable ransom, but wants to be justified by 
the righteousness of the law, or to earn grace by his 
righteousness. Such a one certainly blasohemes God 
and throws away God's grace. But it is frightening to say 
that a man can be so horribly wicked that he should also 
throw away the mercy and grace of God. And yet this is 
what the whole world does, even though it is not 
regarded as such.

245 





wants her to do this, but says that she shows GOtte the 
highest honor. Now follows the second reason of proof: 


For if righteousness comes through the 
law, Christ died in vain. 


Here again | remind you that Paul does not speak of 
the ceremonial law, as the sophists constantly blather. 
And the first authors of this error were Origen and 
Jerome, who were extremely harmful teachers in this 
matter, and who were subsequently followed by all 
scholastics, and their error is approved and confirmed 
today by Erasmus. Godly people must absolutely keep 
away from the foolish work of these people, who turn the 
writings of Paul in such a way with their foolish glosses. 
For they speak of a thing which they have never known 
nor experienced, as if the ceremonies were not also good 
and holy. Certainly the order of the priesthood, 
circumcision, sacrifices, the service, the customs of 
worship, and similar holy works were all ceremonies; 
therefore he speaks of the whole law. 

But these words of Paul must be carefully considered 
in this way: Is it true, or not, that Christ died? Likewise: 
Did he die in vain? Here we must surely answer, if we 
are not completely nonsensical, that he died, likewise 
that he did not die in vain, not for himself, but for us. If, 
then, he did not die in vain, it follows that righteousness 
does not come from the law. 

372. Now therefore, take each of these two laws 
before you, the ceremonial law and the moral law, or the 
holy ten commandments, and imagine that through merit 


in equity (congrul) you have come to be given the Holy 
Spirit, that you have love (although this is something 
quite monstrous and is nowhere found in reality), but 
imagine, | say, that by doing as much as is in you, you 
obtain grace, are righteous, have the Spirit. From where? 
From merit according to equity? Then it follows that you 
have no need of Christ, but he is of no use to you and 
died in vain. 
373. Then also take the ten commandments 


The same is true of the law of the ten commandments, 
which command the highest service of God, namely the 
fear of God, faith, and love for God, as well as love for 
one's neighbor, and provide a man who has been 
justified by the law of the ten commandments; 
nevertheless, it remains true that Christ died in vain. For 
he who has been justified by the law of the holy ten 
commandments has in himself the power to attain 
righteousness, because by not 1) putting up a bar and 
doing as much as is in him, he infallibly earns grace, and 
the Holy Spirit is infused into him, so that he can love 
God and his neighbor. If this is certain, then it follows with 
necessity that Christ died in vain. For what does a man 
need Christ, who loves him and offers himself for him, if 
without Christ, through merit according to equity, he can 
attain grace and then do good works and earn eternal life 


(through merit) according to dignity (de condigno) or at 
least attain righteousness by keeping the law? 

Therefore take away Christ with all his benefits, 
because he is of no use at all. But why is Christ born, 
why is he crucified, why does he die? Why does he 
become my high priest, who loves me and offers the 
unspeakably delicious sacrifice, himself, for me? Why 
does he do all this? In vain, if the way of justification 
taught by the Sophists is true, because then, apart from 
grace and apart from Christ, | find righteousness in the 
law or in myself. 

Is it permissible to suffer such blasphemy and remain 
silent, that the Divine Majesty, who does not spare His 
own Son, but gives Him up for us all, does not act 
seriously in this, but only plays a game? Before | would 
allow this, | would rather that the holiness not only of all 
papists and works saints, but also of all saints and angels 
be cast into the abyss of hell with the devil himself and 
be damned for eternity. | do not want to see anything else 
but Christ. He shall be for me a 


1) Wittenberger: nos instead of: non. 


246 Lri. Gai. 1, 266-269. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1937-1941. 


247 





| want him to be such a great treasure that | consider 
everything else as dung. He shall also be such a great 
light unto me, that, having received him in faith, | shall 
not know whether there be any law, or whether there be 
sin, or whether there be any righteousness or 
unrighteousness in the world. For what are all things in 
heaven and on earth compared with the Son of God, 
Jesus Christ, my Lord, who loved me and gave himself 
up for me? 

Therefore, throwing away the grace of God is the 
greatest sin, and an exceedingly common one, which all 
works saints commit, for since they seek to be justified 


either by merit according to equity (congrui) or by their 
works and their sufferings, or by the law, they throw 
away, as we have said, the grace of God and of Christ. 

377 And the author of all these abominations was the 
pope. For after the gospel of Christ had been darkened, 
even completely eradicated, he filled and burdened the 
world with his ungodly statutes, as is evidenced, among 
other things, by the indulgences and his bulls, in which 
he absolves not those who believe, but those who have 
repented [sufficiently], confessed [purely], and lent a 
helping hand 2c. Thus it is sufficiently testified that Christ 
died in vain, and that his grace is void and in vain. 

Therefore the abominations and blasphemies of the 
papal kingdom are unspeakably great, and yet the blind 
and obstinate sophists, even now, when the light of truth 
shines so brightly, persist in their impious and utterly null 
opinions, saying that the natural powers are inviolate, 
and that men can prepare themselves for grace by their 
good deeds and merits: so much is lacking that they 
should recognize their impiety and their error, that they 
defend it even against their conscience. 

But we insist with Paul firmly and constantly (for we 
do not want to throw away the grace of God) that either 
Christ died in vain, or that the law cannot justify. But 
Christ did not die in vain, so the law cannot justify. Christ, 
the Son of God, gave us salvation out of grace and 
mercy. 





The law could not do this, because if it had been able to 
do this, Christ would have acted foolishly. For if it could, 
Christ would have acted foolishly in giving himself for our 
sins that we might be justified thereby. Therefore we 
conclude that we are not justified by merit in equity or 


dignity (Congrui aut condigni), nor by the cross or 
suffering, nor even by the law, but only by faith in Christ. 

If my salvation is so dear to Christ that he must die 
for my sins, then it is clear that my works and also the 
righteousness of the law are quite bad and completely 
nothing compared to this so glorious and so great 


ransom (pretiO), because | will certainly not be able to 


buy what cost many thousands of tons (talentis) of gold 
for a penny. But the law, to say nothing of other far lesser 
things, with all its works and righteousnesses, is but a 


penny (terunciolus) compared to Christ, by whose 
death and resurrection my death has been overcome 
and righteousness and eternal life have been purchased 
for me. Should | then despise and throw away this 
incomparable ransom, and seek by the law or by works 
of equity and dignity (by this filth and dung, as Paul calls 
it, especially when held against Christ) to obtain the 
righteousness of which Paul here testifies that Christ 
gave it to me freely and out of pure love, and that this 
cost him so much that he had to give himself for me? 
This, as | said, is what the whole world does, especially 
those who want to be considered the best and holiest in 
the world. And thus they sufficiently testify, no matter 
how much they may say otherwise with their mouths, 
that Christ died in vain. This means to blaspheme Christ 
to the highest degree, to spit in his face, to trample the 
Son of God underfoot, to regard the blood of the 
testament as impure 2c. [Heb. 10, 29.] 

381 And since Paul is here thinking of righteousness 
(let it be well observed), he is dealing with a doctrine 
concerning spiritual things, not the worldly or domestic 
government, that is, he is not dealing with the civil law. 


248 


Li-1. oai. 1, 269-271. Explanation of Galatians 2, 21. W. VIII, 1941-194S. 


249 





This is the righteousness that God approves of and 
wants to see done, and to which He also assigns His 
rewards. 

This civil righteousness can also be achieved to 
some extent by reason. But Paul is speaking here of 
righteousness before God, through which we are freed 
from law, sin, death and all evil, and become partakers 
of grace, righteousness and life, and are finally made 
lords over heaven, earth and all creatures. No law, 
neither human nor God's, can bring about this 
righteousness. 

(383) Although the law is added to reason, so that it 
may enlighten and help man and show him what he 
should do and what he should not do, nevertheless man 
cannot attain righteousness with all his powers and with 
his reason, even with the addition of this exceedingly 
great light and the divine benefit, namely the law. But if 
the best that the world has on earth (namely the law, 
which is added to [reason] like a sun to the earthly light 
or to a human torch, which is nevertheless weak, so that 
it may illuminate and guide it) cannot make righteous, | 
ask you, what should reason be able to do without the 
law? What then? Nothing other than what the pope has 
done with his schools and his whole synagogue, monks 
2c., who have also darkened the light of the first 
commandment with human statutes. Therefore, all of 
them, as many as there are, cannot understand even 
one letter of the law, but walk in the darkness of reason, 
and this is a much more pernicious error than that which 
arose from the doctrine of the works of the law. 

384 Therefore these are mighty words, when he 
says: "For if righteousness comes through the law" 2c. 
He is silent about human powers, about reason, about 
any wisdom, however great (for the greater it is, the 
more easily and swiftly it deceives man), but simply 
says: "For so by the law" 2c. Therefore, even if the divine 
law comes to its aid, human reason can not prove the 
righteousness of man. 


It cannot bring about righteousness, but tears away from 
righteousness and casts Christ away. For if it could 
accomplish righteousness, Christ would have died in 
vain. 

Therefore, set the death of Christ squarely against all 
laws, and be like Paul, that you know nothing but Jesus 
Christ crucified [1 Cor. 2:2], so that apart from Him 
nothing else is a light. Then you will be taught, righteous, 
and holy, and will receive the Holy Spirit, who will keep 
you in the pure word and in the right faith. But if Christ is 
put out of sight, then all is in vain. 

Here again we see a_ beautiful praise of 
righteousness from the law or one's own righteousness, 
namely, that it is, as Paul says, a despising and a 
throwing away of divine grace, an emptying and making 
futile of the death of Christ. Paul is not a great orator, but 


see how great occasion (argumenta) he gives [others] 
to prove their oratory. For, | pray thee, where is the ability 
found to bring to light these words, "grace," and that is, 
"to cast away the grace of GOD," likewise, "that Christ 
died in vain," in such powerful speech that thereby the 
matter would be done enough? The shamefulness that 
is committed here is so great that the eloquence of the 
whole world would not suffice to explain it sufficiently. 

It is a small thing to say that a man dies in vain, but 
to say that Christ dies in vain is to nullify him altogether. 
Whoever wants to prove his eloquence has here ample 
material to make a great point and to explain how terrible 
blasphemy is the doctrine of righteousness from the law 
and from works. Could anything more frightening or 
more blasphemous be attributed to me than that | made 
the death of Christ in vain? [But this | would do,] if | would 
keep the law with a view to be justified thereby. But to 
make Christ's death a vain one, that is also to make His 
resurrection, His victory, His glory, His kingdom, heaven 
and earth, God Himself and the majesty of God, in short, 
all things vain. Is this then something small ? If you said 
that the kingdom of the King 


250 


1, 271-273. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1S45-195I. 


251 





of France or the Roman Empire were founded in vain, 
one would think that you had completely lost your mind. 
But that cannot be compared to this at all, when you say 
that Christ died in vain. 

These thunderbolts and lightnings from heaven in the 
writings of Paul against the righteousness of the law and 
against our own righteousness should rightly deter us 
from it. For in Paul's writings, everything concerning the 
monastic life, the spiritual states, and the righteousness 
that is sought through worship, whether these flow from 
the law or from one's own choice, is suddenly thrown to 
the ground and condemned as if by a thunderbolt. But 
who should not take his vows, 





plates, caps, and statutes of men, yea, even the law of 
Moses, when he heareth that by these he casteth away 
the grace of GOD, and maketh the death of Christ vain? 

When the world hears this, it does not believe it to be 
true, for it thinks that the human heart is incapable of 
such great wickedness that it should throw away the 
grace of God and regard the death of Christ as nothing, 
and yet this terrible sin is quite general. For anyone who 
seeks to attain righteousness apart from faith in Christ, 
whether by works, atonement, or suffering, or whether 
by the law of God, casts away the grace of God and 
despises the death of Christ, no matter how much he 
asserts the opposite with his mouth. 


The third chapter. 


Vv. 1. O 
understanding. 


As befits an apostle in his affliction, Paul burns with a 
completely spiritual zeal and fierce emotion, and in his 
discussion and refutation he also includes exhortations 
and speeches of punishment, according to the rule he 
gave in 2 Tim. 4, 2: "Preach the word, stop, whether in 
season or out of season, punish, threaten, exhort. This 
misleads a careless reader into thinking that Paul is not 
teaching in the right way or in good order. He does not 
do this in the manner of orators, but in spirit he keeps 
the most beautiful order. 

(2) Now that he has disputed and demonstrated by 
two very strong reasons that Christian righteousness 
does not come from the law but from faith in Christ, and 
at the same time refuted the teaching of the false 
apostles, in the midst of this discussion he now 
addresses the Galatians and chastises them, "O you 
foolish or senseless Galatians, as if to say, 'Alas! where 
are you? 


you Galatians without

have you come to, you poor Galatians? | taught you the 
truth of the gospel most carefully and you also accepted 
it from me with great zeal and diligence. How is it, then, 
that you fell away from it so soon? Who has bewitched 
you? 

(3) It seems that he scolds the Galatians very harshly, 
saying that they are unintelligent, bewitched and 
disobedient to the truth. But whether he did this out of 
great zeal or out of mercy, | will not argue; both may be 
true. A carnal man would judge it to be an insult rather 
than a godly rebuke. Did Paul, then, set an evil example 
and show himself to be vituperative against the churches 
in Galatia, saying that they were foolish, bewitched 2c.? 
No; for it is proper for an apostle, preacher, or teacher, 
out of Christian zeal, to scold harshly the people over 
whom he presides, and such scolding is paternal and 
holy. In the same way, parents, out of paternal and 
maternal love, are accustomed to call their son a fool or 
a boy, and their daughter a little hurdle. 


252 Lri. (lru. 1, 273-278. Explan. Explanation of Galatians 3, 1, W. VIII, 1951-1955. 


but would not tolerate it if someone else wanted to do it. 
Sometimes a teacher scolds his pupil severely, calls him 
an ass, stabs him with rods; the latter bears it with 
equanimity, but would not put up with it in such a way if 
any of his comrades or fellow pupils did the same. 
Likewise, the authorities rebuke, chastise and punish, 
and this discipline is not only good but also very 
necessary, and without it nothing, neither in peace nor in 
war, can be carried out in the right way. Therefore, if the 
authorities in the church, in the world regiment or in the 
household do not rebuke and punish when it is 
necessary, then they are ineffective and useless, and will 
never administer their office properly. 

(4) Therefore, cries and anger are as necessary in all 
classes as any other virtue. But this should be done in 
moderation and not out of spite, but out of fatherly love 
and Christian zeal; that is, it must not be a childish or 
feminine anger that seeks only revenge, but which 
desires only to remedy the defect, as a father does not 
chastise his son for the sake of seeking revenge and 
cooling his temper, but that the son may be improved by 
this chastisement. And this is good wrath, which is called 
"zeal" in Scripture. For if | chastise a brother or a 
subordinate in this way, | do not seek his destruction but 
his best. 

Therefore it is possible that Paul here either scolds 
the Galatians out of mere zeal, not to destroy them, but 
to bring them back on the right path and to save them, or 
out of mercy and an emotion of compassion, as it were 
after the manner of a complainer who is sorry that the 
Galatians are so miserably deceived, as if he wanted to 
say: | am sorry that it is so bad with you 2c. 

(6) In this way we also rebuke people who are in 
misery, not to insult them or to make them feel their 
misery, but because we have compassion for them and 
would like them to be rebuke. | say this so that no one 
will blasoheme Paul, as if he had reviled the churches of 
God against the commandment of the Gospel. 





253 


7. In the same way, Christ chides the Pharisees, 
calling them serpents, vipers, children of the devil 2c. 

8. but these are reproaches of the Holy Spirit, they 
are reproaches of a father, of a mother, of a faithful 
friend, as it is also said in Proverbs [Cap. 27, 6. 
according to the Vulgate]: "The wounds of a friend are 
better than the kisses of an enemy." Hence it is that the 
same word of reproach, when it comes from the mouth 
of a father, is a very great boon, but when it goes from 
the mouth of a comrade or an enemy, the highest 
disgrace. If two people do the same thing, it is praised in 
one and blamed in the other. If Christ or Paul scolds, it 
is a very great virtue and is praised, but if a philosopher 
or a private person does it, it is a very great fault and is 
disgraceful. Thus the same work and word is a good 
deed in the mouth of Paul, and a bad deed in the mouth 
of another. 

9 But there is an emphasis on the word "Galatians", 
because he does not call them brothers, as he usually 
does, but by their people's name. But it seems to have 
been the fault peculiar to this people that they were 
"unintelligent," like the folk fault of the Cretans, that they 
liked to lie, as if he wanted to say: What is said of you 
and what you are called, that is what you are and remain 
in truth, namely, unintelligent Galatians, and this you 
now prove precisely in this matter of the Gospel, where 
you should be most intelligible, but you do not leave your 
kind. 

In the same way, we distinguish the nations 
according to their faults. Each nation has its particular 
faults. The Germans are novelty-seekers, the Welsh are 
presumptuous 2c. So by the way Paul scolds them here, 
he reminds the Galatians of their natural condition. 

(11) By the way, we are reminded here that in the 
churches and in Christians there still remain the natural 
infirmities that they have according to the flesh. Grace 
does not change the godly in such a way that it 
immediately makes them new and perfect in all things, 
but there still remain in the godly remnants of the old 
natural infirmities.

he is. Therefore, the bread we eat, the drink we drink, 
the clothes we wear, even the air and everything by 
which we live in the flesh is under his dominion. 
Therefore, he can harm the children through his 
sorceresses, either with heart potion, or he can make 
them blind, or steal, or take away a child altogether, and 
put himself in the cradle instead of the child taken away. 
| have heard that there was a child in Saxony who was 
suckled by five wives and yet could not be satisfied. And 
there are many such examples. 

(17) But sorcery is nothing else than a cunning 
artifice and deception of the devil, who, as it is said, can 
restore to health a limb which he has corrupted in a child 
or an old man by his deceptions. But in such a way he 
makes healthy, for example, that he restores an eye or 
another damaged limb, not that it was really injured, but 
that he deceives the senses, both of those whom he has 
bewitched and of others who see the bewitched, in such 
a way that they cannot think that it is a deception, but 
would swear that it is a real injury. But because he 
removes the injury in his own time, it is clear that it was 
only a deception, but not a real injury, because a real 
injury cannot be removed or healed. 

18 You will find an excellent example of this in the 
"Life Descriptions of the Fathers", not to mention the 
"metamorphoses" of the poets. To St. Macarius, who 
lived in the desert, came the parents of a virgin. They 
thought they had lost her, but in such a way that they 
thought she had been transformed into a cow, for they 
could see no other form in her than that of a cow. When 
they brought their daughter to St. Macarius, they asked 
him to pray to God for her, so that she would regain her 
human form. When Macarius heard this, he said: | see a 
virgin, not a cow. He had spiritual eyes, therefore Satan 
could not deceive him with his dazzling work, as he did 
the parents and the daughter, whose eyes the evil spirit 
had so deceived that they were 





257 


They swore that it was in truth as it appeared to them in 
their enchantment before their eyes. But when St. 
Macarius prayed for the Virgin, not that she might regain 
her human form, for she had never lost it, but that God 
might take away from her this deception of the devil, the 
eyes of the parents and the daughter were opened, and 
they recognized that everything they had thought to be 
a real event had been only a game of the devil. 

(19) Such is the cunning and power of Satan to 
deceive the senses, and what is to be wondered at, 
since even through a glass the sensory perception and 
the color change? Therefore, he can easily deceive a 
man by his dazzling work so that he thinks he sees 
something he does not see, he hears a voice, a 
thunderclap, a flute or trombone sound he does not 
hear. Thus the soldiers of Julius Caesar thought that 
they heard someone playing on a flute and blowing ona 
trombone 2c. Suetonius mentions this in his description 
of Caesar's life 1). He says: A man of extraordinary size 
and beautiful figure suddenly appeared sitting nearby 
and played on a flute. Since now beside the shepherds 
also very many soldiers and some trumpeters from their 
camps had run to hear him, he tore away his trumpet 
from one, jumped to the river, blew with tremendous 


breath the signal for the fight (classicum) and went to 
the other bank 2c. So Satan can ape all senses 
extraordinarily, so that you want to swear that you see, 
hear or touch something, which you do not see 2c. 

20 But not only in this crude way, but also in a more 
subtle and therefore much more dangerous way he 
makes people nonsensical, and there he is primarily a 
thousandfold artist. And therefore Paul comes from the 
enchantment of the senses to the enchantment of the 
spirit. But by this spiritual enchantment the old serpent 
does not catch and deceive the senses, but the minds 
of men with false and ungodly opinions, which he, since

259 








The fact that he can really do this is sufficiently 
demonstrated today by the fanatics and the 
blasphemous spirits. That he can really achieve this, 
however, is sufficiently demonstrated today by the 
enthusiasts, the Anabaptists, and the blasphemous 
spirits who attack the Sacrament of the Body and Blood 
of Christ. He has so enchanted their hearts with his 
deceitfulness that they take lies, error and frightening 
darkness for the certain truth and the brightest light, and 
do not let themselves be dissuaded from these dreams 
by any admonitions or sayings of Scripture, because 
they are firmly convinced that they alone are wise and 
have the right understanding of divine things; all other 
people, however, are blind. So they do quite the same 
as the parents of the virgin, who, because they were 
caught by the deception of Satan, were so firmly 
convinced that they would have sworn that their 
daughter was not a man but a cow, and could believe 
nothing less than that this was a deception and delusion 
of the devil. For all their senses bore witness to it; the 
eyes saw the form of a cow, the ears heard the cow's 
roar. 2c. Therefore, they thought that one should not 
argue against the judgment that all men had to make in 


this matter (sensum communem). 

21 This example of Macarius shows that in the case 
of bodily enchantment one must argue against what is 
generally accepted according to outward perception 
(contra sensum communem). Much more must one do 
the same with spiritual bewitchment, where the devil 
brings about what he does outwardly for the senses with 
figures and colors, inwardly with probable opinions and 


doctrinal points (objectis doctrinae), by which, as | have 
said, he makes the hearts of men so nonsensical that 
they would swear that their quite futile and godless 
dreams are the quite certain truth. In this way he has 
bewitched Munzer, Zwingli and others in our time, by 
whom again others have been bewitched in great 
numbers. 

Furthermore, this sorcerer has such a great desire to 
harm that he does not only have this secure... 


1) This and the next following paragraph form § 39 of the 24th 
chapter of Aurifaber's Table Talks. In our edition of the Table Talks 
this is omitted. 





He not only deceives the noble and arrogant spirits with 
his deceptive work, but also tries to dissuade those from 
right understanding by his deceptions, who stand godly 
and right in God's word and the Christian religion. He 
often attacks me so fiercely and overwhelms me with 
sad thoughts that he completely obscures Christ and 
almost takes him away from me. In short, there is no one 
among us who is not often bewitched by false opinions, 
that is, who does not fear, trust, or be joyful when he 
should not fear, trust, or be joyful; there is no one who 
does not sometimes have other thoughts about God, 
about Christ, about faith, about his profession, about his 
Christianity, 2c., than he should have. 

(23) Therefore let us learn rightly the deceit and 
cunning of this sorcerer, lest he find us safe and snoring, 
and deceive us with his wiles. He cannot harm our 
ministry by his sorcery, but he is with us in spirit, going 
about day and night, seeking how he may devour each 
one in particular, and if he does not find us sober and 
armed with spiritual weapons, that is, with the word of 
God and faith, he devours us. [1 Petr. 5, 8. Eph. 6, 14- 
17.] 

"Therefore Satan starts one battle after another 
against us, and this is very useful for us, that he attacks 
and exercises us with his cunning attacks, because in 
this way he makes us firm in the doctrine and 
strengthens the faith in us. We have often suffered a 
defeat in this battle, and this still happens to us, but we 
do not perish, because Christ has always won the 
victory and triumphs through us. 

(25) Therefore we draw a firm hope that we shall be 
victors over the devil also henceforth through Christ, and 
this hope gives us a firm consolation, so that we can 
stand up in all temptations: Behold, Satan also hath 
before challenged us, and by his deceit hath tempted us 
to unbelief, contempt of God, despair, 2c. and yet hath 
wrought nothing; therefore he shall 


2) Aurifaber used the following four paragraphs for the 
"Tischrede", chapter 24, §§ 45 and 46. In our edition of the Table 
Talks, they are omitted.

261 





will not be able to do anything in the future. He who is in 
us is greater than he who is in the world; Christ is the 
stronger one who overcame, overcomes, and will [also 
henceforth] overcome that strong one in us. But the devil 
sometimes overcomes us in the flesh, so that we 
ourselves may wish to experience in this way the power 
of the stronger against that strong, and to speak with 
Paul [2 Cor. 12:10.], "When | am weak, then am | strong." 

(26) Therefore let no one think that the Galatians 
alone were bewitched by Satan, but let each one think 
that he also could have been bewitched and that he can 
still be bewitched by him. No one among us is so strong 
that he could resist him, especially if he tries to do so 
with his own powers. "Job was bad and right, God- 
fearing, and shunned evil" [Job 1:1] and "there was not 
his like in the land" [Cap. 2:3], but what was he able to 
do against the devil when God withdrew His hand from 
him? Did not this holy man fall terribly? 

Therefore, this sorcerer was not only powerful with 
the Galatians, but he always deals with them, that 
although he cannot do this with all men, he deceives 
many by his false pretenses, "for he is a liar and a father 
of lies" [John 8:44]. And certainly, as | have said, by this 
art of his, he even nowadays makes the swarming spirits 
nonsensical, rules in them, and makes them so 
unbending and hard that no anvil can be so hard. They 
do not allow themselves to be instructed, do not listen to 


any reason (rationem), do not allow any scripture to be 
valid, but are only concerned with how they would like to 
escape the scriptural passages brought against them 
with the glosses invented and lied out of their heads and 
defend their dreams brought into the scripture, which is 
a clear sign that they are caught by the devil's sorcery. 


Who charmed you? 


28 Here he excuses the Galatians and puts the blame 
on the false apostles, as if to say: | see that ye fell not of 
your own free will, nor of malice; but the devil hath 
among you, my children, the 


They sent you sorcerers, the false apostles. They have 
so bewitched you with the doctrine of the law that you 
now think differently of Christ than before you heard the 
gospel preached by me. But we strive to break the spell 
with which the false apostles have bewitched you 
through our exhortations and letters to you, so that those 
who are trapped among you by this spell may be set free 
again through us. 

(29) Thus, we too must work today with the word of 
God against the fanatical opinions of the Anabaptists 
and Sacramentarians, so that we may free the people 
captured by them and bring them back to the pure 
doctrine of faith and keep them in it. And this work of 
ours is not in vain, for we have set many of those who 
had bewitched them right again and freed them from this 
bewitchment of theirs, from which they would never have 
been able to break free with their own strength if they 
had not been rebuked by us and brought back on the 
right path by the word of God. 

‘For just as it is impossible for a man to wriggle out of 
the enchantment of the senses (for the parents could not 
see in their daughter any other form than that of a cow 
until Macarius prayed for her 2)), so it is also impossible 
for those who are enchanted by the spirit to free 
themselves by their own powers; but they can only be 
freed if others help them, whose minds are not caught 
by this enchantment. 

For the power of Satan's deception is so great in 
those who are thus deceived that they boast and swear 
that they have the very certain truth; so much is lacking 
that they should confess that they are in error. And even 
if we shower and convict some of them, especially the 
originators of the sects, with sayings of the Scriptures, 
we do nothing, because they immediately have their 
glosses ready, with which they distort the Scriptures. 
Therefore they do not correct themselves by

our exhortations, but only harden more. 

| would never have believed, if | had not learned by 
experience today, that the power of the devil is so great 
that he is able to give lies such a great appearance of 
truth, but also, what is even more frightening, that when 
he wants to torture the afflicted consciences to death 
through excessive sadness, he knows how to disguise 
himself so actually and completely in the form of Christ 
that it is impossible for the challenged to recognize this. 
Therefore, many who do not know this fall into despair 
and lay hands on themselves. For they are so blinded 
by the devil that they are firmly convinced that it is a 
certain truth that they are not being tempted and 
accused by the devil, but by Christ himself. 

The same thing happened in the year of the Lord 
1527 to the wicked man, Doctor Kraus 1) at Halle, who 
said: | have denied Christ, therefore he now stands 
before the Father and accuses me. He had so firmly 
imagined this thought, caught in the devil's deception, 
that he could not be dissuaded by any exhortation or 
consolation, nor by any divine promise. And so he 
despaired and killed himself miserably. 

This was nothing but a lie and enchantment of the 


devil and, to put it briefly, a fanatical description of a 
strange Christ, of which the Scriptures know absolutely 
nothing. For the Scriptures do not portray Christ as a 
judge, tempter, and accuser, but as a reconciler, 
advocate, comforter, savior, and mercy seat. 


1) Doctor Krause (so Luther writes the name in his letter to the 
Christians at Lalle, Walch, St. Louis edition, Vol. X, 2219, and 
Tischreden, Cap. 24, ZI5. ibia. Vol. XXII, 715) cut his neck on All 
Saints’ Day 1527. On Dec. 10, Luther wrote about it to Jonas: 
"Kfrause’s died of eight wounds, but only one was fatal." (Cf. De 
Wette, vol. Ill, 243. Walch, old ed., vol. XVII, 2708, translates: "he has 
been executed by eight wounds.") De Wette's assumption that the 
sudden death mentioned in the letter to Gabriel Zwilling of March 7, 
1528 (Walch, old ed. vol. XXI, 1093) is the same one discussed in the 
letter to the Christians at Halle (De Wette, vol. Ill, p. 305, note) is 
erroneous, because the "chaplain of the nuns" at Halle died suddenly 
on Ash Wednesday <26 Feb.) 1528. 





But because this [Kraus] was bewitched by the devil, he 
could not see this at that time, and therefore, contrary to 
the Scriptures, declared this to be certain truth: Christ 
accuses you before the Father, he does not stand for 
you, but against you, therefore you are condemned. And 
this challenge is not a human one, but a devilish one, 
which that sorcerer imprints with all his might into the 
heart of the challenged. With us, who have the opposite 
opinion, this is considered a shameful and obvious lie 
and deception of the devil, but with those who are 
charmed in this way, it is considered the most certain 
truth, so that there can be no more certain. 

(35) Since the devil, as an artist of thousands, where 
it is necessary to do harm, can stamp such a blatant and 
shameless lie on the heart that you would swear a 
thousand oaths that it is the very certain truth, we must 
not be hopeful, but walk in fear and humility, calling upon 
Christ the Lord, that he will not let us fall into temptation. 

(36) Secure people who, after hearing the gospel 
once or twice, think that they have received the spirit in 


the highest degree (decimas spiritus hausisse), finally 
begin to do so, because they do not fear God, do not 
thank Him, but think that they can not only hold and 
defend the doctrine of godliness excellently, but are also 
able to stand up to the devil in a battle, no matter how 
fierce. Such people are then quite a ready people 
(idonea instrumentau) for the devil, whom he can charm 
and plunge into despair. 

?But do not say, "| am perfect, | cannot fall," but 
humble yourself and fear, lest you, who stand today, fall 
tomorrow. | am a doctor of theology and have now 
preached Christ for a number of years and fought 
against the devil in fine false teachers, but | have well 
experienced how much this has troubled me. 

38 | cannot drive Satan away like this, 


2) Aurifaber used the following two paragraphs for Cap. 24, § 49 
of the Table Talks. In our edition of the Table Talks, this section is 
omitted. 


264 Lri. ttra. 1, 283-288. Explanation of Galatians 3, 1. w. 


VIII, 1970-1974. 265 





| cannot grasp Christ as the Scripture holds him out to 
me, but the devil keeps trying to force a false Christ upon 
me. But thanks be to God, who keeps us in his word, in 
faith and in prayer, so that we know that we must walk in 
humility and fear of God, and not be presumptuous in our 
wisdom, righteousness, learning and steadfastness, but 
in the power of Christ, who is mighty when we are weak, 
and through us weak is always victorious and 
triumphant; to whom be glory forever and ever, amen. 

(39) Therefore, enchantment is nothing else but 
nonsense caused by the devil, who forms a false opinion 
against Christ in the heart; and he is enchanted who is 
caught in such an opinion. Therefore, people who 
believe that they can be justified by the works of the law 
or by the fulfillment of human statutes are bewitched. For 
this opinion is contrary to faith and Christ. 

40 Paul uses this so spiteful word "bewitched" to 
show his contempt and hatred against the false apostles, 
who so vehemently insisted on the teaching of the law 
and works of the law, as if he wanted to say: What (the 
heck) is this satanic enchantment? For as by the bodily 
enchantment the senses are corrupted, so by the 
spiritual enchantment the hearts are corrupted. 


That you do not obey the truth? 


41 Initially, the Galatians had heard the truth and obeyed 
it. Therefore, when he says, "Who bewitched you?" he 
indicates that now that they have been bewitched by the 
false apostles, they have fallen away from the truth they 
obeyed before and have forsaken it. But this reads far 
more harshly, that he says they do not believe the truth. 
For with these words he indicates that they are 
bewitched and that he wants to remove the spell from 
them, and yet they do not want to recognize or accept 
this benefit. For it is certain that he did not bring them all 
back to the truth from the error of the false apostles, but 
the spell remained with many. That is why he uses 
strong words: "Who has bewitched you? 


as if he wanted to say: You have become nonsensical, 
and the spell has caught you so that you cannot obey 
the truth. You cannot obey the truth, as if he wanted to 
say: | fear that it is over with many of you who will never 
return to the truth 2c. 

(42) Here again you hear another glory of the 
righteousness of the law or of one's own righteousness, 
namely, that it so enchants men that they cannot obey 
the truth. The apostles and the fathers of the first church 
often mention this. 1 John 5:16: "It is a sin unto death; 
for this | say not that any man ask." Likewise Hebr. 6, 4- 
6: "For it is impossible that those who have once been 
enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have 
been made partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted 
the good word of God and the powers of the world to 
come, where they fall away, should again be renewed to 
repentance" 2c. These words read at first sight as if a 
novatus had spoken them. But the apostles had to speak 
this way for the sake of the heretics (but they did not 
mean to say that the fallen ones could not return to the 
community of believers through repentance, as the 
Novatians did), and also we have to speak this way 
today because of the authors and teachers of errors and 
sects, because such people never return to the truth. 

(43) Some do turn back, but only those who are under 
a lesser spell, not even the leaders and the authors of 
this spell. For these must retain the title that Paul gives 
them here, namely, that they neither want to hear the 
truth nor suffer it, but rather are only concerned with how 
they might resist the truth, likewise how they might 
escape the grounds of proof and the scriptural passages 
that are brought against them. For they are caught and 
convinced that they have the very certain truth and a 
very pure understanding of the Scriptures. But he who 
has such a conviction does not listen, much less yield to 
others. So also | do not want to hear anything that is 
contrary to my teaching, for | am certain and convinced 
by the Spirit of Christ that my teaching of Christian 
righteousness is true and certain.

To whom Christ Jesus was painted before the 
eyes, 

44 It is very hard that he had said that they were so 
bewitched that they did not obey the truth, but it is much 
harder that he adds that Christ Jesus was painted before 
their eyes in such a way that they could have grasped 
him with their hands, and yet they still did not want to 
obey the truth. Thus he refers them to their own 
experience, as if to say: You are so bewitched, 
entranced and captivated by the erroneous opinions of 
the false apostles that you do not obey the truth, and it 
is of no use that with the greatest diligence and effort | 
have described Christ JEsum to you and painted him 
before your eyes; [you are so bewitched that] he is [now] 
crucified among you. 

With these words, he refers back to the above- 
mentioned reasons, where he had stated that Christ is a 
sinner among those who want to be justified by the law, 
that such people throw away the grace of God, and that 
Christ died for them in vain. When he was present with 
them, he had fiercely pursued these reasons and 
explained them in detail, as if a painter were painting 
Christ Jesus, the crucified one, before their eyes. Now 
that he is absent, he recalls this to their memory by 
saying: "Which Christ Jesus was painted before the 
eyes," 2c., as if he wanted to say: "No painter can paint 
Christ so actually with colors as | have painted him 
before you through my sermon, and yet you still remain 
in your enchantment. 


That he is now crucified among you. 
What have | painted for you? Christ himself. How? That 
he is crucified among you. Here he certainly uses very 
harsh words. Above he said that those who seek to 
attain righteousness from the law throw away the grace 
of God, likewise that Christ died for them in vain. But 
here he adds that such people even crucify Christ, who 
lived and reigned in them before, as if he wanted to say: 
Now you have not only thrown away the grace of God, 
not only has Christ died in vain for you, but in the most 
shameful way among you, you have also been crucified. 


crucifies. The epistle to the Hebrews Cap. 6, 6. also 
speaks in this way: "They crucify even the Son of God to 
themselves and hold Him up to ridicule” 2c. 

47. One should be truly frightened when he only 
hears the name monk, plate, cap, (religious) rule 
mentioned (how much also the papists worship these 
abominations and boast that they are the highest 
worship and holiness, as also we could not think 
otherwise of them before the gospel was revealed, for 
we were brought up in the statutes of men, which 
obscured Christ and made Him all vain to us), hearing 
that Paul here says that even those who seek to be 
justified by the divine law are not only deniers and 
murderers, but also the most wicked crucifiers of Christ. 
But are those crucifiers of Christ who seek to attain 
righteousness through righteousness and the works of 
the law, beloved, what are those who seek to attain 
blessedness and eternal life through the filth of human 
righteousness and the doctrines of devils? 

But who would have ever believed or understood that 
it would be such a terrible and atrocious outrage if 


someone became a clergyman (for that is what they 
call it), that is, if he became a mass priest, a monk or a 
nun? Certainly no one. Yes, they themselves have 
taught that monasticism is a new baptism. But what 
could be said that is more frightening than that the 
kingdom of the papists is a kingdom of those who spit on 
Christ, the Son of God, and crucify him anew? For Christ, 
who was once crucified and resurrected, they crucify 
anew in themselves, in the church or in the hearts of the 
faithful, spit upon Him by blasphemies, reproaches and 
insults, pierce Him with their false opinions, so that He 
dies in them most miserably, and in his place they put a 
very beautiful spell, by which men become senseless, so 
that they do not acknowledge Christ as their Justifier, 
Reconciler and Savior, but consider him a sin-servant, 
accuser, judge and corrupter, who must be reconciled by 
our works and merits. 
49. and from this opinion the 


268 Lri. Sai. 1, 290-292. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 1. Eq. VIII, 1977-I98I. 


269 





This is the most ungodly and pernicious doctrine in the 
entire papacy: If you want to serve God, earn forgiveness 
of sins and eternal life, and help others to attain 
blessedness, enter a monastery, vow obedience, 
chastity, poverty 2c. Caught and puffed up by this false 
idea of holiness, the monks dreamed that they alone 
were in a state and life of perfection, that the other 
Christians led a common life, that is, they did not do such 


works that they were not obliged to do (Opera indebita), 
as chastity, poverty, obedience 2c., but were only 
baptized and kept the ten commandments, but they [the 
monks], in addition to this, which they had in common 
with the other Christians, also kept superfluous good 


works (Opera supererogationis) and the counsels of 
Christ 2c. Therefore, they hoped that they would also 
have a special merit and a place in heaven among the 
greatest saints, far above the rest of the common people 
of Christians. 

(50) This was indeed a terrible delusion of the devil, 
by which he had made almost all men senseless, and 
the holier one wanted to be considered, the more he was 
caught in this enchantment, that is, in this pernicious 
opinion of his own righteousness. Therefore, we could in 
no way recognize that Christ was a mediator and savior, 
but we considered him to be a severe judge who had to 
be reconciled by our works. This was nothing other than 
blaspheming Christ to the utmost and, as Paul said 
above, throwing away the grace of God, letting Christ die 
in vain, and that he not only be killed by us, but be 
crucified anew in the most terrible way. And this is 
actually what Christ [Matth. 24, 15] refers to from the 
prophet Daniel [Cap. 9, 26. f.], that the abomination 
stands in the holy place. 

(51) Therefore, every monk and every one who deals 
with his own righteousness (justitiarius), seeking to 
obtain forgiveness of sins and righteousness by his own 
works or sufferings, is such a man who again crucifies 
Christ, who lives and reigns, not in Christ's own person, 
but in his own heart and in the hearts of others, and 


All those who enter the monasteries with the intention 


(nomine) that they want to become righteous by keeping 
the rule of the order, go into the dens of robbers of those 
who crucify Christ again. 

(52) Paul uses very weighty and terrible words here 
to dissuade the Galatians from the teaching of the false 
apostles and to set them straight, as if he wanted to say: 
Consider what you have done; you have crucified Christ 
anew, and this | show you so clearly and paint it before 
your eyes that you can see and grasp it, because you 
want to be justified by the law. But if righteousness 
comes through the law, then Christ is a servant of sin and 
died in vain. If this is true, then it certainly follows that he 
is crucified again among you. 

And he does not add this word "among you" in vain, 
because Christ in his person can no longer be crucified 
or die in this place, Rom. 6:9, but among us. Namely, if 
we throw away pure doctrine, grace, faith, forgiveness of 
sins without all our merit, and seek to be justified by 
works of our own choosing or even by the works 
commanded in the law, then Christ is crucified among us. 
This false and ungodly opinion that one wants to attain 
righteousness from the law or works is nothing else, as | 
have said above in many words, but a deception and 
enchantment of the devil, by which men are made so 
senseless that they do not recognize the good deed of 
Christ at all and do nothing with their whole life but not 
only deny the Lord, who bought them with his blood and 
in whose name they were baptized, but also crucify him 
anew in themselves. 

Therefore, let everyone who is serious about 
godliness flee from this Babylon as quickly as possible 
and be terrified when he hears the name "Pabstdom" 
mentioned. For the ungodliness and the abomination of 
it is so great that no one can talk it out with words, and 
this abomination can only be seen with spiritual eyes. 

55 Paul emphasizes these two reasons for proof most 
carefully and sharpens them. 


270 Lri. Kai. 1, 2S2-29S. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 1981-1987. 


271 





First, that they are so captivated and bewitched by the 
devil that they do not hear the truth, even when it is| 
painted most clearly before their eyes; second, that they, 
crucify Christ anew among themselves. These words 
seem to be uttered simply and without any sublime 
ornamentation, but they are so great that they far surpass 
all human eloquence. Therefore, only through the Holy 
Spirit can it be seen how terribly wicked he acts who} 
wants to be justified by the righteousness of the law or by 
his own righteousness, namely, that he, as Paul says 
here, is bewitched by the devil, disobeys the truth and 
crucifies Christ anew. Is this not a beautiful praise of the 
righteousness of the law or of one's own righteousness? 

The apostle is therefore inflamed with a very fierce 
zeal and attacks the trust in righteousness, even if it 
should be based on the keeping of the law of God, with 
frightening words, and condemns this opinion and 
imprints this brand on it, so that it crucifies the Son of God 
anew 2c. Since this is something extremely dangerous, 
it cannot be accused enough, nor can it be condemned 
enough, because Lucifer's fall, an irreparable damage, 
results from it. That is why Paul uses such terrible words 
against it that he does not even spare the law of God, 
which he attacks so sharply that it almost seems as if he 
wants to reject and condemn it. But he does this out of 
the highest necessity that forces him to do so, for| 
otherwise he would not have been able to resist the false 
apostles and defend the righteousness of faith against 
them. Although the law is holy, just and good, it must be 


presented (induere) as if it were the person of a 
hypocrite who wants to become just by works. Now he 
penetrates them with a reason of proof taken from 
experience, which they could not deny, and says: 

V. 2. This I will learn from you alone: Did you 
receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the 
preaching of faith? 

57 He speaks these words from an indignant mind. Hel 
says: If | do nothing 





If | had anything else to say against you, | could refer to 
your own experience, as if he wanted to say: Well, 
answer me, your disciple (for you have become learned 
so soon that you are already my teachers and masters), 
did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by 
the preaching of the gospel? By this evidence he so 
convicted them that they could say nothing against it, for 
clear and evident experience testified against them that 
they had received the Spirit not from the works of the 
law, but through the preaching of the gospel. 

Here again | remind you that Paul does not only 
speak of the ceremonial law, but of the whole law. His 
proof is based on the fact that he makes a complete 


distinction (a Sufficient divisione). If he spoke only of 
the ceremonial law, it would not be a_ sufficient 


difference. It is therefore a double sentence (dilemma), 
which consists of two parts, one of which must 
necessarily be true, the other false, namely: You have 
received the Spirit either through the law or through the 
preaching of faith. If from the law, then not from the 
preaching of faith; if from the preaching of faith, then not 


from the law. There is no third (medium) here. For 
everything that is not the Holy Spirit or the preaching of 
faith is law. But we are now dealing with the matter of 
justification. But there is no other way to justification than 
these two: either the word of the gospel or the law. 

(59) Therefore, "law" is taken here in a very general 
way as being quite different and separate from the 
gospel. Not only is the ceremonial law distinct from the 
gospel, but also the law of the ten commandments. So 
Paul is talking about the whole law as a whole. 

60 Paul therefore gives his proof by the complete 
difference [between law and gospel] in this way: he says: 
Tell me, whether you have received the Holy Spirit 
through the law or through the preaching of the gospel? 
To this answer. Ye cannot say, By the law: for as long 
as ye were under the law, and of the law, ye received 
the Holy Ghost. 


272 Lri. <4ra. |, W5-W7. Explan. Explanation of Galatians 3, 2, W. VIII, 1987-1990. 


works, you have never received the Holy Spirit. You have 
taught and heard the Law of Moses every Sabbath, but 
it has never been known or seen that any teacher or 
disciple has been given the Holy Spirit through the 
teaching of the Law. Then you have not only taught and 
heard the Law, but you have also striven with great zeal 
and effort to prove it by works. You should have received 
the Holy Spirit in the fullest measure if it was given 
through the law, since you were not only teachers and 
disciples, but also doers of the law; and yet you cannot 
show that this ever happened. 

(61) But as soon as the preaching of the faith or the 
gospel came to you, immediately, before you did any 
work or brought forth any fruit of the gospel, you received 
the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the faith alone. 
For as Lucas testifies in the Acts of the Apostles [Cap. 
10, 44.], while Peter and Paul were still preaching, the 
Holy Spirit fell on those who were listening to the word 
through this preaching alone, and through it they also 
received various gifts, so that they spoke with new 
tongues 2c. 

(62) Therefore it is evident that the Holy Spirit was 
given to you through the preaching of the faith alone, 
before you did any good work or brought forth any fruit 
of the gospel. On the other hand, the law, even if you 
kept it, never brought you the Holy Spirit, much less if 
you heard it alone. Therefore, not only the hearing of the 
law, but also the effort and zeal with which you have 
endeavored to fulfill the law by deed is in vain. 

(63) No matter how hard a person tries, that is, even 
if he is zealous for God and tries with great effort to be 
saved by the law, and toils day and night with the 
righteousness of the law, he still works and labors in 
vain. "For those who do not know the righteousness that 
is before GOD, and seek to establish their own 
righteousness," as Paul says elsewhere [Rom. 10:3], 
"are not subject to the righteousness that is before 
GOD." 


273 


Likewise [Rom. 9, 31.]: "Israel, which was inferior to the 
law of righteousness, has not come over to the law of 
righteousness" 2c. 

But Paul is speaking here of how the Holy Spirit 
manifested Himself in the first (primitive) church. For the 
Holy Spirit descended upon the believers in a visible 
form, and by this he gave a certain testimony that he was 
present at the preaching of the apostles, also testifying 
that those who heard the word of faith from the apostles 
were counted righteous by God, otherwise he would not 
have descended upon them. 


What the book of Acts is about. 


(65) Careful attention must be paid to this very strong 
argument, which is emphasized throughout the Acts of 
the Apostles; for this book was written for the purpose of 
confirming this argument. For this whole book is about 
nothing else than that it teaches that the Holy Spirit is 
not given through the law, but through the preaching of 
the gospel. For when Peter preached, the Holy Spirit 
immediately fell upon those who heard the word, and in 
one day three thousand people who heard Peter's 
preaching believed and received the gift of the Holy 
Spirit, Acts 2:38, 41. 2, 38. 41. In the same way 
Cornelius did not receive the Holy Spirit through the 
alms he gave, but when Peter opened his mouth and 
was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on all who listened 
to the word with Cornelius, Apost. 10, 44. 10, 44. These 
are obvious proofs from experience and God's works, 
which cannot be deceiving. 

In the fifteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles (vv. 
1 ff.), Lucas writes of Paul: "When he and Barnabas had 
preached the gospel among the Gentiles and returned 
to Jerusalem, he resisted and attacked the Pharisees 
and the disciples of the apostles because they insisted 
on circumcision and the keeping of the law as necessary 
for salvation. Lucas says that he silenced them by telling 
them what he and Barnabas had done among the 
Gentiles, to such an extent that the whole church was 
appalled by this story, especially since they heard that 
God had done something to the Gentiles through the 
Pharisees. 


274

275 





she had performed so many and such great signs and 
wonders among the Gentiles. And since those who were 
zealous for the law wondered greatly how it was possible 
that the uncircumcised Gentiles, who kept neither the 
law nor its works, nor had the righteousness of the law, 
could nevertheless come to this grace, that they might 
be justified and receive the Holy Spirit, just as the 
circumcised Jews did 2c., Paul and Barnabas asserted 


nothing but the obvious fact (experientiam). And those 
who were convicted could not argue against it. In the 
same way, the proconsul Paul Sergius and all the cities, 
countries and kingdoms to which the apostles preached 
became believers without law and works, only through 
the preaching of the faith. 

67: In short, nothing else is said in the whole book of 
Acts than that both Jews and Gentiles, both righteous 
and sinners, are justified by faith in Christ alone, without 
law and works. This is shown both by the sermons of the 
apostles, Peter and Paul, Stephen, Philip and others, 
and by the examples of the Gentiles and the Jews. For 
just as God gave the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to 
the Gentiles who lived without the Law, so He also gave 
the Holy Spirit to the Jews not through the Law, not 
through the services and sacrifices commanded by the 
Law, but through the preaching of faith alone. But if the 
law could have justified, and the righteousness of the law 
had been necessary for salvation, then surely the Holy 
Spirit would not have been given to the Gentiles who had 
not kept the law. But public experience testified that 
without the law the Spirit was given to them, and this was 
seen by the apostles, Peter, Paul, Barnabas and others. 
So it is not the law that justifies, but only faith in Christ, 
which the gospel preaches. 

(68) This must be remembered for the sake of the 
adversaries who do not heed what is written in the book 
of Acts. | also read this book in the past, but | did not 
understand anything in it. Therefore, if you read in the 
book of Acts or anywhere else in 





If you hear or read the word "Gentiles" in Scripture, you 
should know that this is not to be taken from the natural 


nature (Naturaliter) [of the Gentiles“, but in a theological 


way (theologice), namely, for the people who are not 
under the law like the Jews (as it says above Cap. 2, 15: 
"We are Jews by nature" 2c.), but without law. 
Therefore, when it is said that the Gentiles are justified, 
it is nothing else than that men who do not do the law 
and its works, who are not circumcised, who do not 
sacrifice 2c., are justified and receive the Holy Spirit. By 
what? Not by the law and its works, for they do not have 
the law, but in vain, in that nothing at all precedes but 
the preaching of the gospel alone. 

(69) So Cornelius and his friends, whom he had 
called to him, do nothing, neither do they look at the 
previous works, and yet they all receive the Holy Spirit, 
as many as are with them. Only Peter speaks; they sit 
there and do nothing; they do not think about the law, 
much less do it; they do not sacrifice, do not seek to 
obtain circumcision, but only pay attention to what Peter 
speaks. He brought the Holy Spirit into their hearts 
through his preaching, even visibly. For they spoke with 
tongues and praised God. 

70 But someone wants to make this sophistical 
objection: Who knows whether it was the Holy Spirit? 
Let it be mocked, but surely the Holy Spirit, who bears 
witness in this way, does not lie, but shows that he 
considers the Gentiles righteous, and that he justifies 
them by nothing else than the word of the Gospel or the 
preaching of faith in Christ alone. 

71 And in the Acts of the Apostles we can see how 
much the Jews were amazed at this unheard-of event. 
For when the believers of the circumcision, who had 
come with Peter to Caesarea, saw that in the house of 
Cornelius the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out 
on the Gentiles, they were astonished. Likewise those 
who were at Jerusalem confronted Peter, saying that he 
had gone in to the uncircumcised.

VIII, 1993-1997. 277 





and had eaten with them. But when they had heard Peter 
tell them what had happened to Cornelius, they were 
astonished and praised God, saying, "God has given 
blessedness to the Gentiles. 

This word and the rumor that God also gives 
salvation to the Gentiles was at first not only unbearable 
even to the believing Jews, but also an extremely great 
annoyance, which they could not easily get over. For 
they had this privilege before all peoples, that they were 
the people of God. To them belonged the adoption, the 
glory, the service of God 2c., Rom. 9, 4. Then they 
labored with great effort to attain righteousness from the 
law, working all day long, bearing the burden and heat of 
the day [Matth. 20, 12.]. Moreover, they also had 
promises for keeping the law. Therefore they could not 
but murmur against the Gentiles, saying, Behold, the 
Gentiles come quickly, without heat and burden, having 
the same righteousness and the Holy Ghost without 
labor, which we could not obtain by our labor, by the heat 
and burden of the day. They worked, but only for one 
hour, and were more refreshed than wearied by this 
work. Why did God afflict us with the law if it was not 
useful for righteousness? To us, who have long been 
burdened with the yoke of the law, He now prefers the 
Gentiles. For we, who are God's people, have been 
afflicted all day long, but those who are not God's people, 
who also do not have the law and have never done 
anything good, are put on a par with us. 

For this reason, this council of the apostles at 
Jerusalem had to be held out of great necessity, so that 
the minds of the Jews would be calmed; although they 
believed in Christ, this opinion was still very firm in their 
hearts: one must keep the law of Moses. Peter contrasts 
this with his experience and says: "If God has given the 
same gifts to the Gentiles as He has to us who believe 
in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was | that | could resist 
God? Likewise [Cap. 15, 8-10.]: "GOD, the heart- 
denouncer, testified about the 





Gentiles, and gave them the Holy Spirit, as he did us, 
making no distinction between us and them, and 
purifying their hearts by faith. Why then do you tempt 
God by putting the yoke on the disciples' halves, which 
neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?" 2c. 

With these words Peter overturns the whole law as if 
he wanted to say: We do not want to keep the law, 
because we are not able to, "but by the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ we believe to be saved, just as they also" 
[Apost. 15, 11]. So Peter is dealing with this matter, that 
God has given the same grace to the Gentiles as to the 
Jews, as if he wanted to say: When | preached to 
Cornelius, | learned by my own experience that the Holy 
Spirit is given to the Gentiles without the Law, only 
through the preaching of faith, therefore one should in 
no way burden them with the Law. Furthermore, since it 
is evident that neither we nor our fathers were able to 
fulfill the law, you also must abandon the opinion that 
righteousness and salvation can be obtained through the 
law. And this the Jews, who had become believers, did 
little by little, but the unbelievers were all the more 
offended by this preaching, until at last they were 
completely hardened. 


Praise of the book of Acts. 


In the Acts of the Apostles you can find the 


explanation (glossam), the experience and the sermons 
of the apostles, as well as examples for this reason of 
proof against this very stubbornly held opinion of 
righteousness from the law. And for this reason we 
should have this book all the more gladly and read it all 
the more diligently, because it contains exceedingly solid 
testimonies, which give us a certain comfort and can 
raise us up against the papists, our Jews, whose 


abominations and false pretenses (larvas) we fight and 
condemn by our teaching, so that we may glorify Christ's 
benefits and His glory. Although they have nothing solid 
to oppose us with (for the Jews could reproach the 
apostles that they had not heard the law and the whole 
service of God), they have no reason to oppose us. 


278 Oai. 1, 302-304. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 1907-2000. 


279 





(Even if they had not received the law of God), they try 
to defend their godless human statutes and 
abominations with no less stubbornness than the Jews 
defended their law given to them by God, insisting most 
of all that they sit in the episcopate, that they have the 
power to govern the communities. They do this so that 
they may make us servants again and try to deny us that 
we are justified not by faith alone, but by faith that has 
gained its right form through love. But we hold up the 
book of Acts to them, that they may read the same, and 
consider well what things are reported therein, and they 
will find that this is the brief epitome and content of this 
book, that we are justified by faith alone in Christ alone, 
without any works, that the Holy Spirit is given only 
through the preaching of faith to the word of the gospel, 
not to the word or work of the law. 

(76) Therefore we teach thus: If you, O man, are fast, 
give alms, honor parents, obey the authorities, be 
subject to your lord, 2c. you still do not become 
righteous. This word of the law does not justify, "You 
shall honor your father and mother," nor any other, if you 
hear it or do it. What then? When one hears the voice of 
the bridegroom, when one hears the preaching of faith, 
this heard preaching justifies. Why? Because it brings 
with it the Holy Spirit, who makes righteous. 

From this we can_ sufficiently understand the 
difference between the law and the gospel. The law 
never brings the Holy Spirit, so it does not justify, 
because it only teaches what we should do. But the 
gospel brings the Holy Spirit, because it teaches what 
we are to receive. Therefore the law and the gospel are 
two quite opposite doctrines. Whoever says that 
righteousness is attained through the law is fighting 
against the gospel. For Moses with his law is a driver 
who demands that we do works and give, in short, he 
demands of us. The gospel, on the other hand, does not 
demand, but gives freely, and commands that we accept 
what is offered with outstretched hands. But it is 


The difference between demanding and_ giving, 
receiving and giving, is so great that one is the opposite 
of the other, and both cannot take place at the same 
time. For what is given | receive, but what | give | do not 
receive, but give to another. Thus, if the gospel is a gift 
and offers a gift, it follows that it demands nothing. On 
the other hand, the law does not give anything, but 
demands from us the impossible 2c. 


From Cornelius, Apost. 10. 


78 Here the opponents hold up the example of 
Cornelius (of whom also the Magister Sententiarum and 
Erasmus 1) disputes in his Diatribe). Cornelius, they say, 
was, as Lucas testifies, a good, just, God-fearing man, 
who gave many alms to the people and always prayed 


to God [Apost. 10, 2. 31.]. So he deserved in equity (de 


CONngruo) to have his sins forgiven and the Holy Spirit 
sent to him. 

79 | answer: Cornelius was a Gentile, the adversaries 
cannot deny this. For Peter's words in Acts, Cap. 10, 28, 
clearly testify to this when he says: "You know how it is 
not fitting for a Jewish man to go in to a Gentile. So he 
was a Gentile, was not circumcised, did not keep the 
law, yes, did not even think about it, because it was none 
of his business, and yet he is justified and receives the 
Holy Spirit. And this ground of proof, as | have said [§65], 
is specially emphasized throughout the whole book of 
Acts, namely, that the law does not contribute to 
righteousness. 

80 Therefore, this will suffice to defend the article of 
justification, that Cornelius was a Gentile, not 
circumcised, and did not keep the law. Therefore, he 
was not justified by the law, but by the preaching of faith. 
So God justifies without the law, and it follows that the 
law does nothing for righteousness. Otherwise, God 
would have given the Holy Spirit only to the Jews, who 
were

281 





had the law and kept it, not to the Gentiles who did not 
have it, much less keep it. But the opposite happened: 
the Holy Spirit was given to those who did not have the 
Law. Therefore, public experience testifies that the Holy 
Spirit was given to people who did not keep the law. So 
righteousness does not come from the law. In this way, 
the objection of the opponents who do not understand 
the right way of justification is resolved. 

81 Here the opponents raise another objection and 
say: It may be that Cornelius was a Gentile and did not 
receive the Holy Spirit through the law, but it is likely, 
since the text clearly says that he was righteous, God- 
fearing, and gave alms, 2c. that he deserved to receive 
the Holy Spirit. 

82 | answer, Cornelius was righteous and holy in the 

Old Testament because of his faith in the Christ who was 
to come, just as all the fathers, prophets and godly kings 
were righteous because they had received the Holy 
Spirit secretly because of their faith in the Christ who 
was to come. But the sophists make no distinction 
between faith in the Christ who is to come and faith in 
the Christ who has already appeared. Therefore, 
Cornelius would not have been condemned if he had 
died before Christ was revealed, because he had the 
faith of the fathers, who were saved only through faith in 
the Christ who was to come, Apost. 15, 11. 15, 11. So 
he remained a Gentile, uncircumcised, without law, but 
he served the same God as the fathers, through faith in 
the Messiah who was to come. But because Messiah 
had now come, it had to be made known to him through 
the apostle Peter that he should no longer wait for him, 
but that he had already come. 
(83) And it is very necessary to know this article about 
faith in the Christ who is yet to be revealed and in the 
Christ who has already been revealed (so that | may also 
remind you of this incidentally). For now that Christ is 
revealed, we cannot be saved by believing in Christ who 
is yet to come, but must believe that he has already 
come. 





He said that he had fulfilled everything and had done 
away with the law. Therefore Cornelius had to be 
brought to the new faith that Christ had already come, 
while he had previously believed that he was yet to 
come. Thus one faith gives way to another, "by faith into 
faith", Rom. 1, 17. 

For this reason, the sophists err when, in order to 


establish their doctrine of works of merit (Opere 


congrui), they say that Cornelius obtained the grace and 
gift 1) of the Holy Spirit through the works that he 
performed by natural forces according to reason and the 
moral law. For being righteous and godly 2c. are virtues 


(affectus) that are not found in a pagan or natural man, 
but in a spiritual man who already has faith. For if he did 
not believe in GOD and did not fear GOD, he would not 
have hoped to obtain anything from Him through his 
prayer. Therefore Cornelius is praised by Lucas first 
because of his righteousness and fear of God, and only 
then because of his works and alms. The adversaries do 
not pay attention to this, but only tear out this little piece 
and hold stiffly to the fact that he gave alms to the poor, 
because this seems to be useful for them to support their 


doctrine of merit according to equity (merito congrui). 

But one must first praise the person or the tree, and 
then the works and fruits. Cornelius is a good tree; 
because he is righteous and God-fearing, therefore he 
bears good fruit, gives alms, calls upon God, and these 
fruits please God because of faith. Therefore the angel 
praises Cornelius because of his faith in Christ who is to 
come, and leads him from faith in the one who is to come 
to faith in the Christ who has already appeared, saying 
[Apost. 10, 5. 6.]: "Let Simon demand, and he will tell you 
what you should do" 2c. Just as Cornelius was without 
law before Christ was revealed to him, so after Christ 
was revealed to him he did not accept the law, 
circumcision 2c. and just as he did not keep the law 
before.

he did not keep it afterwards either. This reason of proof 
is therefore exceedingly certain: Cornelius became 
righteous without the law, therefore the law does not 
justify. 


Naaman the Syrian. 


Likewise, Naaman the Syrian was undoubtedly a 
good and godly man [2 Kings 5:1 ff] and had a right 
opinion of God. And although he was a Gentile and did 
not belong to the kingdom of Moses, which was then in 
bloom, nevertheless his flesh is cleansed, the God of 
Israel is revealed to him, and the Holy Spirit is given to 
him. For thus he says [2 Kings 5:15], "Behold, | know that 
there is no God in all the earth, save in Israel." He does 
nothing, he does not keep the law, he does not let 
himself be circumcised, but only asks that as much earth 
be given to him as two mules could carry [v. 17]. 

(87) After this it is evident that faith was not idle in 
him. For thus he says to the prophet Elisha [2 Kings 5:17, 
18], "Thy servant will no more sacrifice unto other gods, 
nor offer burnt offerings, but unto the LORD; that the 
LORD may be gracious unto thy servant, where | 
worship in the house of Rimon, when my lord goeth into 
the house of Rimon to worship there, that he may lean 
upon my hand." To him the prophet answers, "Go in 
peace." Thus he is justified. When a Jew hears this, he 
wants to burst with anger and says, "Should a Gentile 
who has not kept the law be justified and made equal 
with us who are circumcised? 


The Gentiles found righteousness without law, since 
the regiment of Moses still existed. 


Thus, long before, when the kingdom of Moses still 
existed and flourished, God indicated that He would 
make men righteous without law, as He surely made 
righteous many kings in Egypt, in Babylon, as well as 
Job and other nations of the East. Also the very great 
city of Nineveh is declared righteous and receives from 
God the promise of salvation that it shall not be 
destroyed. By what? 





283 


Not because this city heard and did the law, but because 
it believed the word of God, which the prophet Jonah 
preached. For this are the words of the prophet [Jonah 
3:5]: "Then the people of Nineveh believed in God, and 
preached fasting, and put on sackcloth," that is, they 
repented. 

89 The adversaries leap over this "they believed," 
and yet all power is attached to this word. You did not 
read in the prophet Jonah: "And the people of Nineveh 
received the law of Moses, and were circumcised, and 
offered sacrifices, and did the works of the law; but when 
they believed, they repented in sackcloth and ashes. 

90 This happened before Christ appeared, although 
there was still faith in the Christ who was to come. If, 
then, the Gentiles, having been justified without the law, 
secretly received the Holy Spirit while the law was still in 
force, why should the law now be required for the 
attainment of righteousness, which has been done away 
with now that Christ has appeared? 

91. This, then, is an exceedingly firm ground of proof, 
taken from the experience of the Galatians, "Have ye 
received the Holy Ghost?" 2c. For they are forced to 
confess that before Paul's preaching they had heard 
nothing of the Holy Spirit, but since he preached the 
gospel they had received the Spirit. 

92 We must confess the same today, convicted by 
the testimony of our own conscience, that the Spirit is 
not given through the law, but through the preaching of 
faith. For before in the papacy many tried with the 
greatest effort to keep the law, the statutes or decrees 
of the fathers, and the traditiones of the pope; and 
indeed with great and manifold exertions in watching, 
fasting, praying, etc., they so worked and corrupted their 
bodies that they were no longer fit for any work, and 
thereby accomplished nothing but that they miserably 
tortured themselves. They were never able to attain a 
calm conscience and peace in Christ, but constantly 


doubted God's gracious disposition (de voluntate) 
toward them. 


284 


Li-1. 6ai. 1, 308-310. Exec. Explanation of Galatians 3, 2. W. vm, 2006-2010. 


285 





Now that the gospel teaches that the law and works 
do not justify, but faith in Christ does, there follows a 
certain knowledge and understanding [of God's gracious 
attitude toward us], a completely happy conscience and 
a completely correct judgment about all circumstances 
and matters in life. Now a believer can say with certainty 
that the papacy with all its orders and statutes is godless, 
which he could not do before. For there was such a great 
blindness in the world that we thought that the works 
which men had devised, not only without but also against 
God's commandment, were far better than the works 
which, according to God's command, the authorities do, 
or a householder, or a schoolteacher, a child, a servant 
2c. 

We should have truly recognized from the word of 
God that the orders of the papists, which alone they 
called holy, were ungodly, since there is absolutely no 
command of God or testimony of them in the holy 
Scriptures, whereas the other orders, which have God's 
word and command, are holy and appointed by God. But 
at that time we were immersed in such terrifying 
darkness that we could not make a correct judgment 
about any matter at all. But now that the light of the 
Gospel shines, we can have a certain and infallible 
judgment about all states in the world. From God's words 


we make the certain judgment that the servant class, 
which is the lowest in the eyes of the world, is much more 
highly esteemed in the eyes of God than all the orders off 
monks, for God approves, praises and adorns the 
servant class by His word; this does not happen to the 
monk class. 

95 Therefore, this reason for proof, which is taken 
from experience, should also apply to us. For although in 
the papacy one did this work and the other another, and 
indeed many and difficult works, they could never be 
certain of God's gracious disposition toward them, but 
were always in doubt, could never come to the 
knowledge of their God, nor to the knowledge of their} 
calling, never felt the testimony of the Holy Spirit in their 
hearts. But now that the truth of the gospel is shining 





If they do not know the truth, they will be taught all these 
things with the utmost certainty through the preaching of 
the faith alone. 

(96) It is not for nothing that | say so much about this, 


for it seems to be very poorly spoken of (exiliter sonat) 
when it is said that the Holy Spirit is given to us through 
the preaching of faith alone, and that nothing else is 
demanded of us except that we renounce all our doings 
and hear only the gospel. The human heart does not 
understand and believe that such a great treasure, 
namely the Holy Spirit, is given by the preaching of faith 
alone, but concludes thus: The forgiveness of sins, 
deliverance from sin and death, the gift of the Holy Spirit, 
righteousness and eternal life are something 
exceedingly great, therefore you must also do something 
great to obtain these priceless gifts. The devil reinforces 
this opinion and magnifies it in the heart. Therefore, 
when reason hears, "You can do nothing to obtain 
forgiveness of sins. Therefore, when reason hears, "You 
can do nothing to obtain forgiveness of sins, but only 
hear God's word," it immediately objects and says, "Oh, 
you make forgiveness of sins 2c. too small and 
contemptible. Thus the greatness of the gift causes us 
not to accept it, and because so great a treasure is 
offered in vain, therefore it is despised. 

97. But we must learn this by all means, that through 
the preaching of faith alone, the forgiveness of sins, 
Christ, and the Holy Spirit are given to us freely, 
regardless of even our exceedingly great sins and our 


indebtedness (demeritis), and must not look at it, We 
must not look at how great what is given to us is and how 
unworthy we are, otherwise the greatness of the treasure 
and our unworthiness would deter us, but we must think 
that it pleases God to give this unspeakable good freely, 
and that to us who are unworthy, as Christ says, Luc. 12, 
32: "Fear not, little host, for it is your Father's good 
pleasure to give you the kingdom", he says. To whom? 
To you unworthy ones, who are a small herd. So if | am 
small, and the thing that is given is great, yes, 
exceedingly great, | must think that he who gives is also 
great. 


286 Lri. Kai. 1, 310-312. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2010-2013. 


287 





and alone be great. When he offers and wants to give, | 
do not look at my sin and unworthiness, but at the 
fatherly will of him who gives against me, and | accept 
the exceedingly great gift with joy and am glad and 
grateful for the unspeakable gift, which was given in vain, 
through the preaching of faith, and that to an unworthy 
one. 

Here again foolish reason is angry and reproves us, 
saying, "That you teach that men need do nothing at all 
to obtain this immeasurable good, but hear the word, 
seems to be the greatest contempt for grace, and to 
make men sure, sluggish, and sleepy, so that they let 
down their hands and want to do nothing at all good. 
Therefore it is not good to preach this, nor is it true, but 
men must be kept from working, from becoming sour, 
and from pursuing righteousness, and then they will also 
obtain this gift. 

The Pelagians once reproached the Christians for 
this very thing, but listen to what Paul says here: "It is not 
from your work and effort, not from the works of the law, 
but from the preaching of the faith that you have received 
the Holy Spirit. Yes, listen to what Christ Himself 
answered to Martha, who was much concerned and 
troubled, and who was distressed that her sister Mary sat 
at JEsu's feet listening to His discourse, but left her to 
minister alone. "Martha, Martha," he said, "you have 
many worries and troubles, but one thing is necessary. 
Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken 
from her" [Luc. 10, 39. ff.]. Therefore, one becomes a 
Christian, not by doing works, but by hearing [the Word]. 

(100) Therefore, whoever desires to attain 
righteousness, let him first of all make it his business to 
hear the gospel. When he has heard and grasped it, let 
him be glad and give thanks to God, and then let him 
practice the good works commanded by the law, so that 
the law and the works follow the preaching of faith. Then 
he will surely be able to walk in the light, which is Christ, 
and surely works he will be able to do. 





choose and do things that are not hypocritical but truly 
good, which he can know are pleasing to God and 


commanded by Him, and despise all pretended (larvas), 
self-chosen works. 

The adversaries think that faith, through which one 
receives the Spirit, is a trivial thing, without any 
importance, but how difficult and high this thing is, | and 
all those who, like me, seriously concern themselves 
with it, experience. It is soon said that one receives the 
Spirit only through the preaching of faith, but this is not 
so easily heard, grasped, believed and retained as one 
speaks of it. Therefore, when you hear from me that 
Christ, the Lamb of God, was sacrificed for your sins, see 


that you also hear this rightly. Paul Significantly called it 
"the preaching of faith" (not "the word of faith", although 
this differs little from it), that is, such a word, which you, 
hearing it, believe, so that the word is not only a word 
spoken by me (VOX M@€a), but is also heard by you and 
enters your heart and is believed by you; then it is in truth 
the preaching of faith, through which you receive the 
Holy Spirit. When thou hast received the Holy Spirit, thou 
shalt also kill thy flesh. 

The godly experience how much they would like to 
hold on to the preached word with full faith and tear the 
(false opinion of the law and their own righteousness 
from their hearts, but they feel the struggle (luctam) in 
the flesh, which opposes the spirit with all its might. 
Because the reason and the flesh want to cooperate 
badly. The "one must be circumcised and keep the law" 
[Apost. 15, 1. Cf. Gal. 5, 3.] cannot be completely 
brought out of us, but it remains in the hearts of all the 
godly. That is why believers have a constant struggle 
with the preaching of faith and the works of the law, 
because the conscience always grumbles against it and 
thinks: this is too easy a way, that only from the 
preaching of the word righteousness, the Holy Spirit and 
eternal life are promised. 

But try earnestly, and you will find out how easy it is 
to accept the word of faith. 


288 Lri. 6-a. 1, 312-314. Exec. Explanation d. Galatians 3, 2-4. 


W. VIII, 2013-2017. 289 





to hear him. Although he who gives is great, then he 
gives great things gladly and simply [Rom. 12, 8.] and 
does not impose them on anyone [Jac. 1, 5.], but you 


make it difficult for yourself to take hold of it (tua 


capacitas difficilis est), and your faith is weak and 
causes you a struggle, so that you cannot accept the 
offered gift. But let your conscience murmur against it, 
and let this "you must" come up again and again, but just 
wait for a while and stand firm until you overcome this 
"you must". Thus, as faith grows, that delusion of 
righteousness from the law will gradually diminish more 
and more; but this cannot happen without great struggle. 


V. 3.4. Are you so foolish? You began in the spirit, 
will you now complete it in the flesh? Have you 
suffered so much in vain? 

(104) After Paul has brought this reason to bear 


(absoluto), namely, that the Spirit is not given by the 
works of the law, but by the preaching of faith, he now 
begins to exhort and deter them by setting before them a 
twofold danger or harm. The first is, "Are ye so foolish 
that ye should come to an end in the flesh, though ye 
began in the spirit?" The second, "Have ye then suffered 
so much in vain?" And this is according to the art of 
speech, that is, to dissuade people by presenting 
dangers and harm, and again to persuade them by 
presenting what is useful, honorable, and easy. So he 
says, "You began in the spirit," that is, your worship of 


God (religio) was beautifully begun and well ordered, as 
he also says afterwards [Cap. 5:7], "You walked finely. 
"2c. But what happens? Now you want it to end with you 
in the flesh, yes, you have already come to the end in the 
flesh. 

Here Paul opposes "spirit" and "flesh". He calls here) 
as | have already reminded above, "flesh", not the 
pleasure, animal passions or sensual desires 


(appetitum sensitivum), because here he does not deal 


with the pleasure or other lusts of the flesh, but with the} 
forgiveness of the flesh. 





of sin, of the justification of the conscience, of the 
attainment of righteousness that is valid before God, of 
deliverance from the law, from sin and from death, and 
yet he says here that because they have fallen away 
from the Spirit, they now accomplish in the flesh. 
Therefore, "flesh" is nothing other than righteousness, 
the wisdom of the flesh, and the thoughts of reason, 
which strives to be justified by the law. So Paul calls 
"flesh" everything that is best and most excellent in man, 
that is, the highest wisdom of reason and the 
righteousness of the law itself. 

(106) And this passage must be heeded for the sake 
of the papist blasphemers, who pervert it against us, 
saying that we began under the papacy in the spirit, but 
now it comes to an end in the flesh, because we have 
taken wives. As if it were a life in the spirit, that one lived 
in celibacy or had no wife, but in the meantime the 
spiritual life was not hindered, if someone was not 
content with one whore, but had several. They are 
people without understanding, who do not understand 
what is spirit or flesh. "Spirit" is everything that is worked 
in us by the Holy Spirit, "flesh" is everything that takes 
place in us according to the flesh, without the Spirit. 
Therefore all the works of Christians, as, loving one's 
wife, rearing children, ruling one's house, honoring one's 
parents, obeying the authorities 2c., which those regard 
as worldly and fleshly works, are fruits of the Spirit. The 
blind people make no distinction between the things that 
are good creatures of God and the vices. 

(107) Here it should also be noted that Paul says that 
the Galatians began in the spirit. There he should have 


added in active form: Now you consummate 
(consummatis) in the flesh; but this he does not do, but 
in a passive form he says: "You are made an end 
(consummamini) in the flesh.” The righteousness of the 
law, which Paul here calls the flesh, does not justify, but 


rather those who, having received the Spirit through the 
preaching of the faith, fall away from it, are made an end 


of by it, that is, they are finished (finiunter) and 
completely destroyed.

judges. Therefore, while those who teach that the law] There, both doing and suffering, both the spirit and the 


must be kept with the intention that men may be justified 
thereby want to counsel the consciences, they do them 
the greatest harm; while they want to make them just, 
they lead them into condemnation. 

But Paul always attacks the false apostles in passing 
(oblique). For they insisted on the law, saying: "Faith in 
Christ alone does not take away sin, does not satisfy’ 
God's wrath, does not justify; therefore, if you want to 
obtain those benefits, you must not only believe in Christ, 
but at the same time keep the law, be circumcised, 
observe the holidays, sacrifice 2c. If you do this, you will 
be free from sin, from God's wrath 2c. Paul, on the other’ 
hand, says: "By this very thing you stir up 
unrighteousness, provoke the wrath of God, heap sin 
upon sin, fall from grace and cast it away, quench the 
Spirit and come to an end in the flesh with your disciples. 
This is the first danger by which he dissuades the 
Galatians, namely, that they [see to it that they] do not 
lose the Spirit in seeking to be justified by the law, and 
spoil the best beginning by an exceedingly evil end. 


Have you suffered so much in vain? 


The second danger or pity is this: "Have you suffered 
so much in vain?"as if he wanted to say: Consider not 
only how beautifully you began, and how miserably you 
have lost the good beginning and the best begun course; 
likewise, that you have not only fallen away from the 
firstfruits and fruits of the Spirit, into the service of sin and 
death, and into the sad and miserable bondage of the 
law; but behold also this, that ye have suffered many 
things for the gospel's and Christ's sake, that they have 
robbed you of your goods, blasphemed you, and reviled 
you, that ye have been in danger of life and limb 2c. life. 
Everything was going well with you: you taught rightly, 
you lived holy, and you suffered all kinds of hardships 
with constancy for the sake of the name of Christ. But 
now doctrine and faith 


fruit of the spirit in you. 

(110) From this it is sufficiently evident what harm the 
righteousness of the law or one's own righteousness 
entails, namely, that those who trust in it suddenly lose 
incomprehensibly great goods (2c.). Furthermore, it is 
something very lamentable that someone so quickly and 
easily loses such great glory and the firm trust of the 
conscience in God, and likewise that he endures such 
multiple and severe suffering and danger to goods, to 
wife and children, to life and limb, and yet suffers all this 
in vain and in vain. 

111. from these two passages [v. 3. and 4.] someone 
could write a eulogy about the 
He would have written about the righteousness of the 
law or his own righteousness and would have gone on 
almost ad infinitum if he had wanted to explain this in all 
its parts, what the spirit was in which they began, then 
what, how great and how much the sufferings were that 
they endured for the sake of Christ. But this cannot be 
sufficiently presented by any oratory, because these are 
the greatest things Paul is talking about here, namely 
God's glory, victory over the world, the flesh and the 
devil, righteousness and eternal life; and on the other 
hand sin, despair, eternal death and hell. 

(112) And yet, we lose those priceless gifts in a 
moment, and suffer these terrible plagues, which never 
end, through the instigation of false teachers, when they 
lead us astray from the truth of the gospel to false 
doctrine, and they do this not only with easy effort, but 
also put on a great pretense of godliness. 


Is it different for free. 


This is an improvement (correctio) by which he 
softens the previous rebuke, which was somewhat 
harsh; and he does this as an apostle, so that he does 
not frighten the Galatians too much. He does punish 
them, but in such a way that he nevertheless always puts 
oil in the wounds.

so that he does not drive them into despair. Therefore he 
says: "Is it otherwise in vain", as if he wanted to say: | 
have not yet given up all hope in you. But if, setting aside 
the spirit, you would complete in the flesh in this way, that 
is, follow the righteousness of the law as you began, then 
you should know that all your stirring and confidence in 
God is vain, and all your sufferings are in vain. | must, 
however, speak somewhat harshly to you, make the 
matter very great and rebuke you severely, especially 
since the greatness of this matter requires it, so that you 
do not think that nothing or little is at stake if you reject 
Paul's teaching and hear and accept another. But | do 
not cut off all hope from you, if you only want to get back 
on your feet, for one must not throw away unclean, sick 
and grinchy children, but care for them more diligently 
and nurture them more carefully than the healthy ones. 

Thus, Paul, as an experienced physician, puts almost 
all the blame on the false apostles who caused this 
pernicious disease. On the other hand, he treats the 
Galatians mildly in order to heal them through this 
gentleness. Therefore, following Paul's example, we too 
should so punish the weak, so care for them and heal 
their sickness, that we also comfort them at the same 
time, so that they do not despair when they are treated 
too harshly by us. 


V. 5. He then that giveth you the Spirit, and doeth 
such works among you, doth he it by the works of the 
law, or by the preaching of faith? 


This reason of proof, which is taken from the 
experience of the Galatians, pleases the apostle so 
much that after he had scolded and deterred them by the 
twofold harm, he now repeats it, and that with an 
addition, saying, "Who now giveth you the Spirit," 2c. that 
is, not only have you received the Spirit from the 
preaching of the faith, but all that you have in knowledge 
and works you have from the preaching of the faith, as if 
he were saying, "You have received the Spirit from the 
preaching of the faith. 


1) Wittenberger: ?auto instead of: xaulo. 





wanted: That was not enough that God had given you 
the Spirit once, but the same God has always given and 
multiplied the gifts of the Spirit, so that the Spirit, once 
you had received it, always increased and was strong in 
you. 

From this it is clear that the Galatians performed 
miracles or at least exquisite works (Virtutes), that is, 
fruits of faith, which the true disciples of the Gospel are 
wont to bring, for in another place the apostle says, "the 
kingdom of God is not in words, but in power. But 
"power" is not only to speak of the kingdom of God, but 
also to show by deed that God is powerful in us through 
His Spirit. Thus he says of himself, above Cap. 2, 8:""He 
who was strong with Petro among the Jews was also 
strong with me among the Gentiles. 

Therefore, when a preacher preaches in such a way 
that the word does not remain without fruit, but is 
powerful in the listeners, that is, when faith, hope, love, 
patience 2c. follow, God gives the Spirit and works 
glorious deeds in the listeners. In a similar way, Paul 
says here that God has given the Spirit to the Galatians 
and has done deeds among them, as if he wanted to say: 
God not only worked through my preaching that you 
became believers, but that you also lived holy and 
brought forth many fruits of faith and endured hardships. 
Likewise, by the same power of the Spirit, you were 
changed from stingy, adulterous, angry, impatient, 
hostile people 2c. to those who are generous, chaste, 
gentle, patient, and love their neighbor. Therefore he 
gives them Cap. 4, 14. 15. the testimony that they 
received him as an angel of God, yes, as Jesus Christ, 
and that they loved him so much that they would have 
been willing to tear out their eyes 2c. 

But to love one's neighbor so fiercely that one is 
ready to give money, goods, eyes, life, and everything 
for his good, and also to patiently endure all adversities, 
these are surely powers of the Holy Spirit. And these 
powers, he says, you have received and had before 
those false teachers came to you, you have had them.

not from the law, but from God, who gave you the Spirit 
and increased it daily, so that the gospel had its most 
blessed course among you, with teaching, faith, work 
and suffering. Since you know this well, convicted by the 
testimony of your own conscience, how is it that you no 
longer do the same deeds as before? That is, that you 
do not teach rightly, do not believe godly, do not live 
righteously, do not do good works, do not suffer evil 
patiently? Who has so changed you that you no longer 
love me as before? Now you would no longer receive 
Paul as an angel of God, no longer as Christ Jesus; you 
would no longer pluck out your eyes and give them to 
me. How is it, | say, that you no longer strive for me with 
such fervent love, but now prefer to me the false 
apostles who seduce you so miserably? 

119 This is how it is with us today. When the 
preaching of the Gospel began, there were very many 
who liked our teaching exceedingly, and who were well- 
meaning and reverent toward us, and the preaching of 
the Gospel was followed by powers and fruits of faith. 
What happens? Suddenly swarming spirits arise, which 
in a short time overthrow what we had built up in long 
years and with much sour labor, and also make the 
hearts of those who before loved us dearly and received 
our teaching with thanksgiving so hostile to us that now 
nothing is more hated by them than our name. But the 
devil is the author of this evil, who works in his members 
the opposite forces, which fight against the powers of the 
Holy Spirit. 

120 The apostle says: "Dear Galatians, your own 
experience should have taught you that these great 
deeds did not come from the works of the law. For just 
as you did not have them before the preaching of the 
faith, so you do not have them now that the false 
apostles rule among you. 

121 We can say the same thing today to those who 
boast that they are evangelical and free from the tyranny 
of the pope: "Have you overcome the tyranny of the pope 
and attained freedom in Christ through the spirits of the 
swarms, or through us, who are the 





Have they preached faith in Christ? If they want to 
confess the truth here, they must say: Certainly through 
the preaching of faith. And it is true that when our 
preaching began, the doctrine of faith had a very happy 
course. Indulgences, purgatory, vows, masses and 
similar abominations were abolished, which led to the 
downfall of the whole papacy. No one could justly 
condemn us. For the doctrine was pure, straightened 
many consciences and comforted them, which had long 
been oppressed by human statutes under the papacy, 
which was a real tyranny and torture chamber of 
consciences. Therefore, many thanked God that they 
had been snatched out of these snares and tortures of 
the conscience by the Gospel, which by God's grace we 
first preached at that time. 

But when the spirits arose who, by denying the bodily 
presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, by desecrating 
baptism, by destroying the images, and by abolishing all 
ceremonies, wanted to bring the papacy completely 
down at once and thus obscure our glory, they 
immediately began to blaspheme our doctrine. For the 
accusation was generally raised that the followers [of our 
doctrine] were divided among themselves. This angered 
a great many and turned them away from the truth, and 
it aroused the hope among the papists that we would 
perish with our doctrine in a very short time, because it 
would be at odds with itself, and that they would soon 
regain their strength and, through this cause, regain their 
old prestige and dignity. 

Therefore, just as the false apostles claimed and 
strongly insisted that the Galatians, who were already 
justified by faith in Christ, had to be circumcised and had 
the Law of Moses if they wanted to be free from sins and 
God's wrath and obtain the Holy Spirit, and just by doing 
so only burdened them the more with sins, because sins 
are not taken away by the Law, nor is the Holy Spirit 
given by it, but the Law only causes wrath [Rom. 4, 15] 
and instills terror: so today the zealots, who are in favor 
of the salvation of all 


296 Oai. 1, 321-323. Explanation of Galatians 3, 5, W. VIII, 2027-2030. 


297 





(catholicae) Church and eradicate the papacy all at 
once and bury it completely by abolishing the 
ceremonies, destroying the images and fighting against 
the sacraments, did not help the Church with these very 
things, but rather harmed it; they did not overthrow the 
papacy, but strengthened it even more. 

124. But if, as they had begun, they had taught in 
harmony with us, diligently insisting on the article of 
justification, that we are justified neither by the 
righteousness of the law, nor by our own righteousness, 
but by faith alone in Christ alone, then truly this few 
articles, as it had already begun, would have gradually 
put down the papacy with its brotherhoods, indulgences, 
orders, relics, [false] services, invocation of the saints, 
purgatory, masses, vigils, vows, and other such 
innumerable abominations. But those left the preaching 
of faith and Christian righteousness and attacked the 
matter differently, to great harm to the pure doctrine and 
to the churches. Therefore they were like those who, as 
the German proverb says, "fish before the fish". For they 
chased away the fish, which the net already wanted to 
enclose, by trying to seize them with their hands. 

That is why the papacy is shaken and falls nowadays, 
not by the storming of the red spirits, but by the 
preaching of the article of justification, which has not only 
weakened the kingdom of the Antichrist, but has also 
preserved and defended us against his power, and if we 
had not had this protection, the red spirits would have 
perished long ago, and we with them. And yet they do 
not recognize this benefit at all, so that instead of loving 
us, as the Psalm says, they blaspheme us and persecute 
us with extremely hostile hearts. 

(126) But the article of justification, which is the only 
safeguard, not only against all power and cunning of 
men, but also against the gates of hell, is this, that by 
faith alone in Christ alone, without works, we are 
declared righteous and saved. If this is the true way of 
becoming righteous 








(as it certainly is, or the whole Scripture would have to 
be dissolved), then it follows immediately that we are not 
declared righteous by monasticism, nor by vows, nor by 
masses, nor by any works. Then, without any outward 
cause, without rebellion, without any human power, 
without any attack against the sacraments, the Pabstacy 
will be overthrown by the Spirit alone, and this victory will 
not be brought about by us, but by Christ, whose benefits 
we preach and praise. 

What | am about to say is also borne out by 
experience. For at the time when the papacy first began 
to incline and fall, the pagans did nothing at all, nor were 
they able to do so, but remained silent. On the other 
hand, we taught nothing and insisted on nothing but the 
article of justification, which at that time alone damaged 
the reputation of the pope and destroyed his empire. But 
when the spirits of the mob saw that the papacy was 
falling and tilting, and the fish were gathered around the 
net, they wanted to take away our glory by overthrowing 
the papacy at once and completely eradicating it, and to 
seize all the fish that were gathered in front of the net 
with their hands; but they lost their effort, for they did not 
catch them, but only scared them away. 

(128) Therefore, just as the false apostles brought 
righteousness to the Galatians by their teaching of 
keeping the law, so also have the pagans overthrown the 
papacy by their storming. Images and other abuses in 
the church would have fallen of their own accord if they 
had taught the article of justification diligently and purely. 
But they were driven by vain honor, for they would have 
liked to hear it said of them that they had overthrown the 
papacy. Therefore they left the article of justification 
undone and caused that storm by which they also almost 
suppressed us and strengthened the papists in their 
abominations. This is what happens to our nobility when 
we seek our own glory and not that of God. 

129. neither the pope nor the devil fears such storms 
and outward terrors (/arvas), but the doctrine of faith, 
which is 


298 Lri- 1, 323-326. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VNI, 2030-2034. 


299 





that Christ alone is the victor over sin, death and the devil 
is terrible to him. For this destroys his kingdom and, as | 
have said, it preserves and defends us against all the 
gates of hell, and if we did not lean on this anchor, we 
would inevitably have to worship the pope again, and 
there would be no way or means to resist him. For if | 
wanted to unite myself with the spirits of the rotten, my 
conscience would be unsafe, because they would set 
themselves against the pope without any right, seeking 
their own honor, not God's. Therefore, if | did not use 
other weapons, | would have to worship the pope again, 
and there would be no way or means to resist him. 
Therefore, if | were not armed with other weapons than 
they, | would not dare to attack the papacy, much less 
presume to destroy it. 

130 But they say: The pope is the antichrist. Quite so; 
but he again says that he has the office of teaching, that 
he has the power to administer the sacraments, to bind 
and loose, and that he possesses this power rightly, 
because it was handed over to him by the apostles as 
an inheritance. Therefore, he is not pushed out of his 
seat by this external storming, but by the preaching of 
the faith, in this way: Dear pope, | will kiss your feet and 
acknowledge you as the supreme bishop, if you will 
worship my Christ and allow us to have forgiveness of 
sins and eternal life through his death and resurrection, 
not by keeping your statutes. If thou wilt yield in this, | 
will not take away thy crown and power; but if not, | will 
continually cry out that thou art the Antichrist, and testify 
that all thy worship and spiritual states are not only a 
denial of God, but also the highest blasphemy and 
idolatry. 

(131) The spirits of the pagans do not do this, but only 
seek to wrest his crown and power from him by external 
force; therefore, their efforts are in vain. One must do 
this [that one bears witness against him] above all 
things, so that the pope's ungodliness and abominations 
come to light, with which he has deceived the whole 
world under the appearance of holiness and spirituality 


(religionis) 2c. If | do this, | would like to see what he will 
keep afterwards. For | 


have taken away his core and leave him the shells. On 
the other hand, they take away his shells and leave him 
the core. 

In short, just as from the works of the law the deeds 
have not been done, so from these outward works, to 
which the pagans insist, nothing comes in the church but 
turmoil, greater confusion, and hindrance of the Holy 
Spirit, which experience testifies. For by destroying the 
images and arguing against the sacraments, they have 
not overthrown the pope, but only made him more 
hopeful. By the Spirit, however, he was cast down and 
is still cast down today, that is, by the preaching of faith, 
which testifies that Christ was given for our sins. Then 
the righteousness and the bondage of the laws of the 
pope must fall away. 

In the meantime, however, | have often pleaded and 
still plead that | would gladly suffer the pope's statutes if 
he would only allow them to be free and not bind 
consciences to believe that they would be justified if they 
kept them, but would be damned if they did not. But this 
he does not do. For if he did not bind consciences to his 
statutes, what power would he have? That is why he is 
most careful to keep the consciences entangled and 
captive by his laws. That is where these speeches come 
from: You cannot be blessed if you do not obey the 
Roman See. Hence come these lightnings and 
thunderings in the bulls: Whoever should be 
presumptuous and dare to do something contrary to this, 
let him know that he will incur the wrath of the Almighty 
God 2c. 

134 He absolutely denies blessedness to all who do 
not obey his laws. On the other hand, he promises 
eternal life to those who keep them. Thus he drives us 
into the net of the righteousness of works, as if no one 
could be righteous and saved if he did not keep his laws. 
In short, he does not mention faith in a single word, but 
teaches only what is his. But if he were to allow all his 
laws to serve nothing for the attainment of righteousness 
before God, then we would be willing to give him many 
things in return. 


ZOO Dri. dsi. 1, 326-328. Ex. Explanation of Galatians 3, 


but then his empire would fall by itself. 

For if he were to lose the power to save and to 
condemn, then the pope would be nothing more than a 
mere idol. In short, the righteousness of the heart knows 
nothing of any law, not only of the pope, but also of 
Moses, for true righteousness comes not from the works 
of the law, but from the preaching of faith, which is 
followed by the deeds and fruits of the Spirit. 


V. 6: Just as Abraham believed God, and it was 
counted to him for righteousness. 


Up to this point, Paul has based his proof on 
experience, and has made great use of this reason for 
proof, which is taken from experience. He says: "You 
believed, and since you believed, you performed 
miracles and many glorious deeds, and also suffered 
[many] evils, which are all powers and effects, not of the 
law, but of the Holy Spirit. The Galatians had to confess 
this because they could not deny what they saw with 
their eyes and perceived with their senses. Therefore, it 
is an exceedingly powerful and clear reason for proof, 
taken from the experience or effects on the Galatians 
themselves. 1) 

Now he adds the example of Abraham and cites 
testimonies of the Scriptures. The first passage is from 
the 15th chapter [v. 6] of the first book of Moses: 
"Abraham believed God" 2c. He acts this saying here 
very powerfully, as also in the letter to the Romans Cap. 
4, 2. 3. He says: "If Abraham has been justified by the 
works of the law, he has righteousness and glory, not 
before God, but before men, because before God he has 
only sin and wrath. But before God he is righteous not 
because he has done works, but because he has 
believed. For the Scripture says: "Abraham believed 
God, and this was counted to him for righteousness." 

138. Paul even explains this saying there 


1) Here now follows in Menius a longer elaboration, which in the old 
edition of Walch takes up two whole columns, that "Paulo is to do 
everything to establish the main article of faith well", of which nothing 
is found in the Latin. 





5. 6. W. VIII, 2034-2041. Z01 
He acts in a glorious way, as he is worthy of it, and acts 
widely. He says [Rom. 4, 19-24]: "Abraham was not 
weak in faith, nor did he look at his own body, which was 
already dead, because he was almost a hundred years 
old, nor at the dead body of Sarah. For he did not doubt 
the promise of God through unbelief, but grew strong in 
faith and gave glory to God, and knew in all certainty that 
what God promises, he can also do. That is why it is 
counted as righteousness for him. This is not written for 
his sake alone, that it is counted to him, but also for our 
sake" 2c. 

By these words: "Abraham believed God," Paul 
makes faith in God the highest service of God, the 
greatest compliance, the highest obedience, the most 
pleasing sacrifice. Now let him who is a good orator carry 
on this saying, and he will see that faith is an almighty 
thing, and that its power is immeasurable and infinite. For 
it gives glory to GOtte, which is the greatest thing that 
can be given. But "to give glory to GOtte" is to believe 
Him, to hold Him to be true, wise, just, merciful, almighty, 
in short, to recognize that He is the author and giver of 
all good. 

Reason does not do this, but faith. It completes 


(consummates) the Godhead, and is, that | say so, the 
creator of the Godhead, not as far as the essence 


(substantia) of God is concerned, but in us. For without 
faith, God loses in us His glory, wisdom, justice, truth, 
mercy, 2c., in short, nothing of His majesty and divinity 
is left to God where faith is not. God also demands 
nothing more from man than that he give him his honor 
and divinity, that is, that he not consider him an idol, but 
God, who takes care of us, hears us, has mercy on us, 
helps us 2c. If this is granted to him, he has his divinity 
whole and unharmed, that is, he has everything that a 
believing heart can give him. Therefore, he who can give 
this honor to God has the highest wisdom, the highest 
righteousness, the highest worship, the most pleasing 
sacrifice. From this you can understand how great a 
righteousness faith is. 


302 Li-I. 1, 328-330. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2041-2045. 


and again, how great a sin unbelief is. 

Therefore, anyone who believes the word of God, as 
Abraham did, is righteous before God, because he has 
the faith that gives glory to God, that is, he gives to God 
what is due to him (this is also how the [worldly] laws 
describe a righteous person). For faith speaks thus: Dear 
GOt, | believe you what you speak. But what does GOtt 
speak? Impossible things, lies, foolish, low (infirma), 
unrational, abominable, heretical and diabolical things, if 
you consult reason. For what is more ridiculous, foolish 
and impossible than for God to say to Abraham that he 
will conceive a son from the barren and already dead 
body of Sarah? 

In this way, God, when he holds up articles of faith to 
us, always holds up to us things that are utterly 
impossible and inconsistent, if one wants to judge 
according to reason. It certainly seems ridiculous and 
inconsistent to reason that the body and blood of Christ 
are presented to us in the Lord's Supper, that baptism is 
a bath of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit, that the 
dead will rise on the last day, that Christ, the Son of God, 
is conceived, carried in the womb of the Virgin, and born, 
that he suffers the most shameful death on the cross, 
rises again, now sits at the right hand of the Father, and 
has all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore Paul 
calls the gospel of Christ crucified a word of the cross 
and a foolish sermon, which the Jews consider an 
annoying, but the Gentiles a foolish doctrine 2c. [1 Cor. 
1, 22. f.]. Therefore reason does not understand that 
hearing and believing God's word is the highest service 
of God, but holds that what they themselves choose and 
do (as they call it) in good opinion and out of their own 
devotion is pleasing to God. Therefore, when God 
speaks, she judges that his word is heresy and the devil's 
word, because it seems (apparet) to her that it is 
unrighteous 2c. 

Faith, on the other hand, puts an end to reason and 
kills this beast, which the whole world and all creatures 
cannot kill. This is how Abraham killed his reason. 





303 


killed by faith in God's word, through which he was 
promised the seed from the barren and already dead 
Sarah. Of course, reason in Abraham did not 
immediately agree with this word, but certainly fought 
against faith in him, and considered it ridiculous, 
tasteless and impossible that Sarah, who was already 
not only a ninety-year-old, but also barren by nature, 
should bear a son. Faith had this fight with reason in 
Abraham, but faith kept the victory in him, and reason, 
the most bitter and pernicious enemy of God, was 
strangled and destroyed csacrificavit). 

(144) So also all believers go with Abraham into the 
darkness of faith, killing reason and saying: You, reason, 
are foolish, you do not understand what God is, therefore 
do not speak against me, but be silent, do not judge, but 
hear the word of God, and believe. Thus, through faith, 
the godly strangle this beast, which is greater than the 
world, and thereby show God the most pleasing sacrifice 
and service. 

And compared to this sacrifice and worship of the 
godly, all the worship of all pagans and all the works of 
all monks and works saints are nothing at all. For by this 
sacrifice, as | have said, they first kill reason, the greatest 
and most insurmountable enemy of God; for reason 
despises God, denies His wisdom, justice, power, truth, 
mercy, majesty and divinity. Then they give GOtte his 
glory by the same sacrifice, that is, they believe that he 
is just, good, faithful, true 2c., they believe that he is able 
to do everything, that all his words are holy, true, living, 
powerful 2c., which is GOtte's most pleasing service. 
Therefore, no greater, better, or more pleasing worship 
or service can be rendered to GOtte in the world than 
faith. 

On the other hand, the faithless saints of works do a 
lot, they fast, pray, and put on their own crosses. But 
because they think they can appease God's wrath and 
earn mercy through these things, they do not give God 
His glory. That is, they do not believe that God is merciful 
and true and that He fulfills His promises, but they 
believe Him to be 


304 Lri. 1, 330-333. Exec. Explanation d. Galatians 3, 6. 


W. vm, 2045-2049. 305 





an angry judge who must be reconciled with works, and 
in this way they despise God, accuse Him of lying in all 
His promises, deny Christ and all His benefits: in short, 
they push God from His throne and put themselves in 
His place. For they neglect and despise God's word and 
choose services and works that God has not 
commanded. They let themselves dream that God is 
pleased with them and hope that they will receive a 
reward from Him. Therefore, they do not kill their reason, 
the bitterest enemy of God, but make it alive and take 
away God's majesty and divinity and attach it to their 
works. 

Therefore faith alone gives glory to God, as Paul, 
Rom. 4:20 ff., testifies of Abraham: "Abraham," he says, 
"grew strong in faith and gave glory to God, and knew in 
all certainty that what God promised he was able to do. 
Therefore it is counted to him for righteousness." 


Christian righteousness stands in the faith of 
the heart and in the imputation of GOD. 


This sentence: "It is counted to him for 
righteousness", from the 15th chapter of the first book of 
Moses [v. 6], he adds not without cause. For Christian 
righteousness stands in two things, namely, the faith of 
the heart and the imputation of GOD. Faith is indeed the 
essential (formalis) righteousness, and yet it is not 
sufficient, because after we have come to faith, the 
remnants of sin in the flesh still cling to us. This sacrifice 
of faith began in Abraham, but is not completed until 
death; therefore the other part of righteousness must be 
added, which makes it perfect, namely, divine 
imputation. Faith does not give God substantially 
(formally) enough, because it is imperfect; indeed, there 
is hardly a speck of faith in us that begins to give God his 
divinity. We have received the firstfruits of the Spirit, but 
not yet the fullness of the Spirit. 

Then reason is not completely killed in this life, which 
is evident from the fact that in us there are still evil 
desires, anger, impatience, and 


other fruits of the flesh and unbelief are left. Likewise, 
even the more perfect saints do not have full and 
constant joy in God, but are sometimes of one mind, 
sometimes of another, sometimes sad, sometimes 
happy, as the Scriptures testify of the prophets and 
apostles; but such faults are not imputed to them for the 
sake of faith in Christ, otherwise no man would be 
blessed. 

150 So we conclude from these words, "And it is 
reckoned unto him for righteousness," that 
righteousness indeed begins by faith, and that by it we 
have the firstfruits of the Spirit, but because faith is weak, 
it [righteousness] is not made perfect without the 
imputation of God. Therefore faith begins righteousness, 
and imputation makes it perfect until the day of Christ. 

The Sophists also argue about imputation when they 


say that God accepts man for the sake of works (de 


acceptatione operis), but they do this without and 
against Scripture, because they draw it only to the works. 
They do not pay attention to the impurity and inner 
corruption of the heart, such as unbelief, doubt, 
contempt and hatred of God, which are the main beasts, 
the sources and causes of all evils. They look only at the 
outward and gross vices and iniquities, which are the 
little books that flow from those sources. Therefore, they 
attribute to the works that God accepts the person 


(acceptationem), because God accepts the works, not 
out of debt (@X debito), but according to equity (@X 


congruo). 

On the other hand, we exclude all works and attack 
the heads of that beast called reason, which is the main 
source of all evil. For reason does not fear God, does not 
love God, does not trust God, but surely despises Him, 
is not moved by His threats nor by His promises, does 
not delight in His words and deeds, but murmurs against 
God, is angry with Him, judges and hates God, in short, 
it is God's enemy, Rom. 8:7, which does not give Him 
His glory. If this pestilence, reason, were killed, the 
outward and gross sins would be nothing. 

153. therefore, above all, we must 








306 Oai. 1, 333-338. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2049-2053. 307 





First of all, we must strive to kill unbelief, contempt and 
hatred of God, grumbling against God's judgment, 
against God's wrath and all His words and works through 
faith, and then we will kill reason. For it cannot be killed 
by anything other than faith, which trusts in God and 
gives Him glory, regardless of the fact that it soeaks what 
seems to reason to be foolish, inconsistent and 
impossible, also regardless of the fact that God creates 
a completely different image of Himself than reason can 


approve (judicare) or grasp, namely thus: Not because 
of your observance of the law, not because of your works 
or merits, but because of your faith in my only begotten 
Son JEsum Christum, who was born for your sins, 
suffered [for them], was crucified and died, | will accept 
you and declare you righteous, and what sin is left in you 
| will not impute to you. Therefore, unless reason is put 
to death, and all the worships and services of God in the 
wide world, which have been devised by men to bring 
about righteousness before God, are condemned, the 
righteousness of faith has no place. 

When reason hears this, it immediately becomes 
angry, nonsensical, and shows its enmity toward God, 
saying, "Are good works nothing? Have | labored in vain, 
bearing the burden and heat of the day? Hence comes 
this rebellion of the heathen, the nations, the kings and 
the princes against the Lord and His Christ [Ps. 2:1, 2]. 
The world does not want and cannot suffer its wisdom, 
righteousness, worship and services to be punished and 
condemned; the pope with his own does not want to be 
regarded as having erred, much less does he suffer to 
be condemned 2c. 

Therefore, those who study the Scriptures should 
learn from this saying, "Abraham believed God, and it 
was counted to him for righteousness," to describe 
Christian righteousness actually and clearly, so that it is 
trust in the Son of God, or the trust of the heart in God 
through Christ. After that, they should also add the [other] 
part, in order to describe [righteousness]. 





(To make the righteousness complete). 1) This trust is 
counted as righteousness for Christ's sake. For (as | 
have said [§148]) these two things make Christian 
righteousness perfect, namely, faith in the heart, which 


is a gift given by God, and essentially (formaliter) 
believing in Christ; according to which God counts this 
imperfect faith toward perfect righteousness for the sake 
of Christ, in whom | have begun to believe. 

For the sake of this faith that takes hold of Christ, God 
does not see that | doubt His gracious will toward me, 
does not see the distrust, the sadness of spirit and other 
sins that | still have. For as long as | live in the flesh, sin 
is truly in me. But because | am sheltered under the 
shadow of Christ's wings, like a little chick under the 
wings of the hen [Matth. 23, 37.Because | am protected 
under the shadow of Christ's wings, like a chick under 
the wings of a hen [Matth. 23, 37.], and live safely under 
the vast heaven of forgiveness of sins, which is stretched 
out over me, God covers and forgives what is left of sin 
in me, that is, because of the faith with which | have 
begun to take hold of Christ, He counts imperfect 
righteousness to me as perfect righteousness, but not sin 
as sin, although it is truly sin. 

Thus we live under the veil of Christ's flesh [Heb. 
10:20], which is our pillar of cloud by day and our pillar of 
fire by night, so that God may not see our sin. And though 
we see them and feel the terrors of conscience because 
of them, yet we are preserved by taking refuge in Christ, 
our Mediator and Reconciler, through whom we have 
been made whole. For as in him are all things, so also 
through him we have all things, who also completes all 
things in us. When we believe this, God overlooks the 
remnants of sin that still cling to our flesh and wants them 
to be covered as if they were not. . He says: "Because 
you believe in my Son, your sins, even though you have 
them, shall be forgiven you, until 


1) tanquam differentiam - as a whole (cf. Walch, St. L. Ausg., 
vol. XIX, 428). 


308 


that you may become completely free of them through 
death. 

This teaching of Christian righteousness, which the 
sophists do not understand, nor can they understand, the 
Christians should learn to understand most diligently. But 
they should not think that they can learn it all at once. 
Therefore they should take the trouble to read and reread 
Paul's writings often and with the greatest care, and 
compare the first with the last, yes, the whole of Paul with 
himself, and then they will find that the matter is such that 
Christian righteousness consists in these two things, 
namely, faith, which gives glory to God, and the 
imputation of God. For faith, as | said, is weak, therefore 
God's imputation must be added, that God will not impute 
what is left of sin, that he will not punish it or condemn us| 
for it, but will cover it and forgive it as if it were nothing, 
not for our sake, not because of our worthiness or works, 
but solely for the sake of Christ in whom we believe. 

Thus, a Christian man is both a righteous man and al 


sinner, a friend and an enemy of God. These contraries 
(contraria) the sophists do not allow, indeed, none of 


them, because they do not accept (tenent) the right way| 
of justification. Hence, they forced people to do good 
works until they were completely sinless, and by doing 
so, they caused many who tried with all their might to 
achieve this, to become completely righteous in essence 


(formaliter), and yet could not attain it, to fall into 
madness, and even countless numbers of those who 
held this ungodly doctrine fell into despair at the hour of 
their death. This would also have happened to me if 
Christ had not graciously looked upon me and delivered 
me from this error. 

On the other hand, we teach and comfort a sorrowful 
sinner in this way: Dear brother, it is impossible for you 
to become so righteous in this life that you should feel no} 
sin at all, and that your body should be bright and without 
spot as the sun, but 


1, 835-337. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians],6. w. vill, 2053-2056. 





309 


because you still have wrinkles and stains, and yet you 
are holy. But you say: How can | be holy, since | have 
and feel sin? That you recognize and feel your sin is 
good, thank God, but do not despair. That is a step 
towards health, when a sick person recognizes and 
confesses his illness. But how can | be freed from sin? 
Run to Christ, the physician who heals the 
brokenhearted [Ps. 147:3] and makes sinners blessed. 
Do not follow the judgment of reason, which reproaches 
you that he is angry with sinners, but kill reason and 
believe in him. If thou believest, thou art righteous, 
because thou givest him glory that he is almighty, 


merciful, true, 2c., thou givest God justice (justificas) 
and praise, in short, thou impute to him his deity and all. 
Whatever sin remains with you is not imputed, but 
forgiven you for the sake of Christ, in whom you believe, 
who is completely righteous according to his nature 


(formaliter), whose righteousness is yours, but your sin 
is his. 

161 From this we see that every Christian is a true 
priest, because he first sacrifices and chokes his reason 
and carnal mind, and then also gives glory to God for 
being just, truthful, patient, merciful and compassionate, 
and this is the daily morning and evening sacrifice in the 
new covenant: the evening sacrifice to kill reason, the 
morning sacrifice to praise God. This is how a Christian 
daily and constantly deals with and practices this twofold 
sacrifice, and no one can sufficiently praise the value 
and worthiness of the Christian sacrifice. 

162 Thus, as we have said, Christian righteousness 
is that which God imputes as righteousness or to 
righteousness because of faith in Christ or for Christ's 
sake. When the sophists hear this wonderful description, 
which is unknown to reason, they ridicule it, because 
they imagine that righteousness is a_ quality 


(qualitatem) that was first infused and then spread to all 
members. They cannot get rid of the thoughts of reason, 
which pretends that a right knowing (judicium) and a 
right willing is justice.

311 





Therefore this unspeakable gift is higher than all 
reason, that God regards and acknowledges as 
righteous without any works the one who by faith alone 
takes hold of His Son, who was sent into the world for 
us, born, suffered, and was crucified 2c. 

The matter is easy as far as the words are 
concerned, namely, that righteousness is not essentially 


(formaliter) in us, as Aristotle disputes, but apart from 
us, in the grace and imputation of God alone, and that 


nothing of the essence (formae) or of righteousness is 
in us except that weak faith or the firstfruits of faith, that 
we have begun to take hold of Christ, yet truly sin 
remains in us. But it is not a joke, but a serious and 
exceedingly great thing, because Christ, who is given to 
us, and whom we take hold of in faith, has not done a 
small thing for us, nor played a game, but, as Paul said 
above [Cap. 2:20, 3:13], "He loved us, and gave himself 
for us; he became a curse for us. "2c. But it is not a 


useless playing with thoughts (speculatio) that Christ is 
offered for my sins and becomes a curse for me, so that 
| may be snatched out of eternal death. Therefore, if one 
takes hold of this Son and believes in Him from the heart 
(which is God's gift), then it comes about that God 
imputes this faith, even though it is imperfect, for a 
perfect righteousness. 

And here we are in a completely different world, 
where reason has nothing to do (extra rationem), 
where there is no debate about what we should do, by 
what kind of works we can earn grace and forgiveness 
of sins, but here we are in divine theology, where we 
hear this gospel that Christ died for us, and that we who 
believe this are counted righteous, although 
nevertheless sins remain in us, and great sins at that. 
166 In the Gospel of John, Christ also describes the 
righteousness of faith and says: "He himself, the Father, 
loves you. Why does he love you? Not because you 
have been Pharisees, blameless in the righteousness of 
the law, not because you are circumcised, do good 
works, fast 2c. 


detn, because | have chosen you from the world, and you 
have done nothing but "that you loved me and believed 


that | came forth from the Father. This gift (hoc 


objectum), namely "I", which the Father has sent into 
the world, has pleased you, and because you have 
grasped this gift, therefore the Father loves you and you 
please him. 

And yet, elsewhere he calls them evil and asks them 


to ask for forgiveness of sins. This virtually (@X 


diametro) contradicts each other, that a Christian is 
righteous and loved by God, and that he is nevertheless 
a sinner at the same time. For God cannot deny his 
nature, that is, he cannot but hate sin and sinners, and 
this he necessarily does, for otherwise he would be 
unjust and love sin. How, then, can these two 
contradictory things be true at the same time? | have sin 
and am worthy that God be angry with me and hate me, 
and the Father loves me? Here nothing else can mediate 
(intercedit) than Christ alone. He says: The Father loves 
you, not because you are worthy of love, but because 
you have loved me and believed that | came from him. 

Thus a Christian remains in right humility by feeling 
sin in truth and acknowledging that he is worthy of God's 
wrath and judgment and eternal death for this reason, so 
that he is humbled in this life. At the same time, however, 
he remains in a right holy pride, by which he turns to 
Christ and through him [Christ] aligns himself against this 
feeling of divine wrath and judgment, and believes that 
not only what is left of sin is not imputed to him, but also 
that he is loved by the Father, not for his own sake, but 
for the sake of Christ, whom he loves. 

From this it is evident how faith without works 
justifies, and how the imputation of righteousness is 
nevertheless necessary. The sins remain in us, which 
God hates exceedingly. Therefore, for their sake, we 
must have the imputation of righteousness, which is 
given to us because of Christ, who was given to us and 
taken by us in faith. 


312 Lri. ttai. 1, 339-341. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 6. 7. 


313 





In the meantime, as long as we live, we are carried 


and nurtured in the bosom of divine mercy and 
longsuffering, until the sinful body is taken away and we 
are raised as new men on the last day. Then there will 
be a new heaven and a new earth, in which 
righteousness will dwell [2 Pet. 3:13]. In the meantime, 
sin and the ungodly dwell under this heaven, and even 
the godly have sin. Hence it is that Paul, Rom. 7, 
complains about the sin that still remains in the saints, 
and yet Cap. 8, 1, says that "there is nothing damnable 
in those who are in Christ Jesus". Who then can 
reconcile these highly contradictory things, that sin 
should not be found in us, that he who is worthy of 
condemnation should not be condemned, that he who is 
rejected should not be rejected, that he who is worthy of 
wrath and eternal death should not be punished? The 
one mediator between God and men, Jesus Christ, as 
Paul says: "There is therefore nothing condemnable in 
those who are in Christ Jesus." 


V. 7. Now therefore ye know that they 
which are of faith are the children of 
Abraham. 


This is a general statement and the main action of 
Paul against the Jews, that the believers celebrate 
Abraham's children, not those who are born of his flesh 
and blood. He emphasizes this point of contention 


(disputationem) here and in the letter to the Romans, 
cap. 4 and 9, because this was the highest defiance and 
glory of the Jews: We are the seed and children of 
Abraham, who was circumcised and kept the law; 
therefore, if we want to be true children of Abraham, we 
must do as our father 2c. It was indeed a great glory and 
dignity that they were Abraham's seed, for no one can 
deny that God spoke for the seed of Abraham and of the 
seed of Abraham. But this privilege was of no use to the 
unbelieving Jews, which is why Paul also fiercely argues 
against this reason of theirs, and wrests from the Jews 
their highest defiance, which he, as a chosen instrument 
of Christ, could do before others. 


For if we had to argue against the Jews from the 
beginning without Paul, we would perhaps accomplish 
very little against them. 

Now Paul argues against this defiance of the Jews, 
who boasted arrogantly, in such a way: We are the seed 
of Abraham. Quite right. Abraham was circumcised and 
kept the law; we do the same. | admit that. What next? 
Do you want to be righteous and blessed because of 
that? That cannot be fine. 

Yes, let us go to the patriarch Abraham himself and 
see in what way he was justified and saved. Certainly 
not because of his glorious virtues and holy works, not 
because he left his father's country, fine friendship and 
fine father's house, not because he_ received 
circumcision and kept the law, not because he wanted 
to sacrifice his son Isaac at God's command, on whom 
the promise was based that he should have 
descendants, but because he believed God. Therefore, 
he was justified by nothing other than faith. 

Therefore, if you want to be justified by the Law, your 
father Abraham should have been justified much more 
by the Law. But he could not have been justified, nor 
received forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit, if it had 
not been by faith. Since this is true according to the 
testimony of Scripture, why do you argue in favor of the 
law and circumcision, claiming that you can attain 
righteousness and salvation through them, since even 
Abraham, who is your father, origin and head, of whom 
you boast, was justified and saved through faith alone, 
without both law and circumcision? What can be said 
against this ground of proof? 

Therefore Paul concludes with this saying: "Those 
who are of faith are Abraham's children"; the procreation 
of flesh and blood or the bodily seed does not make 
them Abraham's children in the sight of God, as if he 
wanted to say: "No one who is descended from this 
Abraham, the servant of God, whom God chose and 
who became righteous through faith, is considered a 
child in the sight of God for the sake of a fine fleshly birth, 
but rather a child of Abraham. 


314 


But children must be given to him in the sight of God, of 
such a nature as he himself, the Father, had. But he is a 
father of faith, and that he began to be righteous and 
pleasing to God was not because he was able to beget 
children, not because he had circumcision and the law, 
but because he believed God. Therefore, whoever wants 
to be a child of the believing Abraham must also believe, 
otherwise he is not a child of the chosen Abraham, 
accepted and justified by grace, but only of the child- 
producing Abraham, who is nothing other than a man 


conceived in sins, born and constitutus under sin, 
without forgiveness of sins, without faith, without the Holy 
Spirit, like another man, therefore condemned. Of this 
kind also are the children born of him according to the 
flesh, who bring nothing with them from their father but 
flesh and blood, sin and death, and so are likewise 
condemned. So this glory: We are Abraham's seed, is 
void and useless. 

This reason is explained by Paul, Rom. 9, 7. ff, with 
two examples from Scripture. The first is of Ishmael and 
Isaac, both of whom were Abraham's seed and natural 
children, and yet Ishmael (who was as much born of 
Abraham as Isaac, yea, would have been the firstborn if 
fleshly procreation granted a privilege and made children 
of Abraham) is excluded, and the Scripture says [Gen. 
21:12.], "In lsaac shall the seed be called unto thee." The 
second is of Esau and Jacob. Since they were still in their 
mother's womb and had done neither good nor evil, it 
was said [Gen. 25, 23. Rom. 9, 12. f.], "The greater shall 
serve the lesser. Jacob have | loved, but Esau have | 
hated." So it is evident that "those who are of faith are 
Abraham's children. 

177 But someone might object, as the Jews do and 
as some clever people do nowadays, that the word "faith" 
means "truth" in Hebrew, therefore we wrongly put such 
emphasis on it. Furthermore, the passage from the 15th 
chapter of the first book of Moses (v. 5. 6.) speaks of a 
physical thing, namely of the promise of descendants, 
therefore Paul twisted it badly and said 


Di-1. kai. 1, 341-344. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2063-2067. 


315 


They claim that the faith in Christ is not the only reason 
for this, but that it is simply to be understood from the 
faith of Abraham, in which he believed that he would 
have a seed, as God had promised him. And with this 
they want to show that the scriptures and proofs cited by 
Paul prove nothing. 

178 They can also raise their quibbles about the 
passage that Paul cites from the prophet Habakkuk 
[Cap. 2, 4], which speaks of the faith that everything that 
the prophet saw (visionis) shall be fulfilled, not only of 
the faith in Christ, of which Paul cites it. In the same way, 
they could deal with the whole 11th chapter of the letter 
to the Hebrews, which deals with faith and examples of 
faith. Such spirits, stingy of vain honor, seek to gain 
praise and prestige in these things, as if they were wise 
and learned, when they least ought to be. But we will 
answer their quibbles briefly for the sake of the simple. 

To the first objection | answer thus: faith is nothing 
other than the truth of the heart, that is, the right thinking 
(cogitationem) of the heart about God. But only faith 
thinks right and thinks right of God, not reason. But then 
man thinks rightly of God when he believes His word. But 
if, apart from the word of God, he wants to measure and 
believe in God according to his reason, then he does not 
have the truth concerning God; therefore, he can neither 
think nor judge rightly of Him. For example, if a monk 
imagines that his cap, plate and vows are pleasing to 
God, and that He accepts these things and gives him 
grace and eternal life in return, then he does not have 
right thoughts of God, but lying and ungodly ones. 

Therefore, the truth is just the faith that judges rightly 
of God, namely, that God does not look upon our works 
and righteousness as impure, but that He will have 
mercy on us, look upon us graciously, accept us, justify 
us, and make us blessed, if we believe in the Son whom 
He sent to be the propitiation for the sins of the whole 
world. These are the right thoughts of God, and there is 
nothing at all wrong with them. 


316 


than faith itself. With my reason | cannot grasp it, nor can 
| be sure that | am accepted by grace for Christ's sake, 
but | hear that this is proclaimed through the gospel, and 
| grasp it by faith. 

181 To the second objection | answer: Paul correctly 
cites the passage Genesis 15:6 about faith in Christ, 
because with every faith there must be trust in God that 
He is merciful. This includes faith in the forgiveness of 
sins for Christ's sake. For it is impossible that the 
conscience could expect anything good from God if it is 
not first certain that God is merciful to it for Christ's sake. 
Therefore all promises are to be referred to the first 
promise of Christ, Gen. 3, 15: "The seed of the woman 
shall bruise thy head" 2c. This is also how the prophets 
understood and interpreted it. Therefore, the faith of the 
fathers in the Old Testament and our faith now in the 
New Testament are one and the same, although other 


and different objects (objecta) are always added, which 
Peter Apost. 15, 10. 11. testifies, when he says: "Neither 
our fathers nor we were able to bear this yoke, but we 
believe to be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, just as they also were." And Paul says 1 Cor. 
10:4: "Our fathers drank all the same spiritual drink: but 
they drank of the spiritual rock which followed with them, 
which was Christ." And Christ himself says this of 
Abraham, John 8:56, saying, "Abraham your father was 
glad that he should see my day, and he saw it, and 
rejoiced." 

But the faith of the fathers was in Christ who was to 
come, just as our faith is now in him who has come. 
Abraham was justified in his time by faith in the Christ 
who was to come. If he lived today, he would be justified 
by faith in the one who has now appeared and is now, 
as | said above [§ 82] of Cornelius, who at first believed 
in Christ who was to come, but after being taught by 
Peter he believed that he had already come 2c. 
Therefore, the difference of time does not change faith, 
not the Holy Spirit, not the 


Li-t. dri. 1, 344-346. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 7, w. vill, 2067-2070. 





317 


gifts. For in relation to Christ, the same will and the same 
thoughts have always been, are still, and will be the 
same in the future, as with the fathers in the past, so with 
those who now live, and with the children who will live 
after us. So also we still have a future Christ and believe 
in him, just as the fathers of the Old Testament did. For 
we expect him to come in glory at the last day to judge 
the living and the dead, of whom we now believe that he 
came to save us. Therefore, no one resents Paul's citing 
this passage in this way, but only these tasteless 


brawlers (Cavillatores). 
(183) But we must not in any way revert back to the 


future Christ (ad futurum Christum redire), except if 
we expect him to be our Savior at the last day, who will 
deliver us from all evil. For if we did that, we would 
believe that Christ had not yet been revealed, but had 
yet to be revealed, and so we would deny Christ and all 
his benefits, deny the Holy Spirit and make God a liar, 
and would in fact testify that he had not yet fulfilled what 
he had promised, as the Jews do. 

184 Therefore, as | have said, Paul correctly applies 
the passage from the first book of Moses, which speaks 
of the faith of Abraham, to the faith of Christ, because all 
the past promises were included in the promise of Christ 
who was to come. Therefore we both, Abraham and the 
other fathers, as well as we, are justified by faith in 
Christ, they by faith in the one who is to come, we by 
faith in the one who is now. For we are now dealing with 
the nature and manner of justification, which is the same 
on both sides, whether Christ has already come or is yet 
to come. So it is enough that Paul proves that the law 
does not justify, but only faith, whether this is directed to 
the one who is to come or to the present Christ. Christ is 
also today to some against- 


318 Lri. 641. 1, 346-348. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2070-2073. 


319 





present, others future. For the believers he is present, or 
he has come to them; for the unbelievers he has not yet 
come, nor does he benefit them. But when they hear the 
gospel and believe, he becomes present to them and 
makes them righteous and blessed. 


V. 7. Now therefore ye know that they which are 
of faith are the children of Abraham. 

185 As if he wanted to say: Since everything is now 
excluded, reason, law, works, descent (generatione) 
from the fathers, you see from this example of Abraham 
and the bright testimony of Scripture that those are 
Abraham's children who are of faith, whether they be 
Jews or Gentiles. For it was not by the law, but by 
righteousness through faith, that the promise was made 
to Abraham that he should be the heir of the world, that 
is, that in his seed all the families of the earth should be 
blessed, and that he should be called a father of many 
nations. And lest the Jews should falsely interpret this 
word "nations" to mean themselves alone, the Scripture 
has resisted this by saying, not simply [Gen. 17:5], a 
father of nations, but, "| have made thee a father of many 
nations." Therefore Abraham is not only the father of the 
Jews, but also of the Gentiles. 

From this it is evident that the children of Abraham 
are not children according to the flesh, since he is not a 
father of the Gentiles according to the flesh, but children 
according to faith, as Paul declares Rom. 4:17: "I have 
made you a father of many Gentiles in the sight of God, 
whom you have believed. Therefore Paul makes a 


twofold (duos) Abraham, one who begets children, the 
other who believes. Abraham has children and is a father 
of many Gentiles. Where? Before God, where he 
believes, not before the world, where he begets children. 
For there he is a child of Adam, a sinner, or, if he is many, 
a man who deals with the righteousness of the law 
(operator), who lives according to reason, that is, 
according to human ways, but this is nothing compared 
to Abraham, who believes. So this example of Abraham 
understands at the same time the teaching of the Holy 
Scripture itself, which says that we are counted righteous 
by faith. Therefore this reason for proof is twofold 








very firmly, both because of the example of Abraham and 
because of the prestige (auetoritatem) of Scripture. 


V. 8. But the Scriptures have seen before that God 
justifies the Gentiles through faith. 


187 This belongs to the previous reason of proof, as 
if he wanted to say: You Jews boast too highly of the law 
and praise Moses beyond all measure with wonderful 
exaltations of praise, that God spoke to him in the bush 
2c., as at least the Jews boast against us with great 
arrogance and say (what | have heard more than once): 
You Christians have the apostles, the pope, bishops 2c., 
we Jews have the patriarchs, the prophets, yes, we have 
God Himself, who spoke to us in the bush, on Mount 
Sinai, where He gave us the Law, in the Temple 2c. Bring 
also such glory and such glorious testimony for 
yourselves against us 2c. To this Paul, the apostle to the 
Gentiles, replies: This boasting and bragging of yours is 
of no avail, for the Scriptures forestalled it, and foreknew 
long before the law, that the Gentiles should not obtain 
righteousness by the law, but by the blessing of the seed 
of Abraham, which (as Paul afterwards [v. 17.] says) was 
promised to him four hundred and thirty years before the 
law was given. And this promise of blessing, which was 
given to Abraham, could not be weakened nor annulled 
(antiquare) by the law, which was given so many years 
later, but it remained firm and will remain forever 
(perpetuo). What can the Jews say to this? 

This reason, which is taken from a very specific time, 
is very strong. The promise of blessing was given to 
Abraham four hundred and thirty years before the people 
of Israel received the Law. For to Abraham it was said 
[Gen. 22, 18.): Because you believed God and gave Him 
glory, therefore you shall become the father of many 
Gentiles [Rom. 4, 17. 20.]. Abraham is made a father of 
many nations by the promise of God, and the inheritance 
of the world is laid on his children before the law. What 
boasts 


320 Lri. dai. 1, 348-350. Explanation of Galatians 3, 8. W. VIII, 2073-2077. 


321 





Do you then, O Galatians, obtain forgiveness of sins, 
become children, and receive the inheritance by the law, 
which followed the promise only after a long time, 
namely four hundred and thirty years afterward? 

In baptism is the promise of blessedness: "He that 
believeth and is baptized shall be saved. Now, if 
someone were to say here (as the enthusiasts do 
nowadays) that the child is not given righteousness and 
blessedness as soon as he is baptized, by trying to 
nullify the promise in this way, that it should only apply 
when the person has come to the use of reason and can 
now do good works; and by his good works he obtains 
what is held out in the promise; likewise, baptism is not 


a signum of God's gracious disposition toward us, but 


only an external notam, which makes a distinction 
between believers and unbelievers 2c.Such a one would 
completely deny the blessedness of baptism and 
attribute it to works. So did the false apostles and their 
disciples in all things. They praised the law and its glory 
most highly, but they ignored and despised the promise 
given to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before 
the law, not wanting to recognize that Abraham, whom 
they boasted of as the father of all their people, since he 
was still uncircumcised and lived so many centuries 
before the law, was justified by nothing other than faith 
alone, as the Scriptures, Genesis 15:6, clearly show. 
15:6, testifies most clearly: "Abraham believed the Lord, 
and He counted it to him for righteousness." Later, since 
he had already been counted righteous by faith, the 
Scripture mentions circumcision Cap. 17, 10. by saying: 
"This is my covenant, which you shall keep between me 
and you" 2c. 

190 With this evidence Paul convicts the false 
apostles in the strongest possible way, and clearly 
shows that Abraham was justified by faith, without 
circumcision and before it, four hundred and thirty years 
before the law. Quite the 





He treats the same reason in the fourth chapter of the 
Epistle to the Romans [v. 5. 9. 10. 11.], namely, that 
righteousness was imputed to Abraham before 
circumcision, and that while he was still in the foreskin 
he was righteous, that is, much more before the law. 
191 Paul says, "The Scriptures have foreknown and 
foreknown your boasting and bragging about the 
righteousness of the law and works. When? Before 
circumcision and before the law, because the law was 
not given until four hundred and thirty years after the 
promise, since Abraham was not only justified without 
the law and before the law, but was also dead and buried 
[before the law]; and his righteousness flourished 
without the law, not only until the law, but it will also 
flourish until the end of the world. If therefore the father 
of the whole Jewish people became righteous without 
the law and before the law, much more will the children 
attain righteousness in the same way as the father. So 
righteousness comes from faith, and not through the law. 


Therefore it proclaims to Abraham: In you all the 
Gentiles shall be blessed. 


192) Over these glorious and exceedingly precious 
sayings: "Abraham believed God," 2c., "I have made you 
the father of many nations," and similar ones, which 
praise faith to the highest degree and contain promises 
of spiritual things, the Jews not only walk about 
carelessly, but also raise quibbles about them and turn 
them into their foolish and ungodly glosses. For they are 
blinded and obdurate, so they do not see that these 
passages deal with faith against God and with 
righteousness before God. With the same perversity 
they also pervert this beautiful saying of the spiritual 
blessing [Gen. 22, 18]: "In you all nations shall be 
blessed", because they say that "to bless" is as much as 
to praise, to wish for good and to be glorious before the 
world 2c. In this way they say: blessed is the Jew, who 
is born of the seed of Abraham, blessed is the fellow Jew 


(proselytum), who worships the God of the Jews, and 
joins them. 


322 Oai. 1, 386-363. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2077-2080. 


323 





joined to it. So they think that the blessing is nothing else 
than praise and glory in this world, that someone can 
boast that he is from the tribe and lineage of Abraham. 
But this is to pervert the sayings of Scripture, not to 
interpret them. 

193 Paul describes and presents us with these 
words: "Abraham believed God" the faithful, righteous 
Abraham, who has the promise and is spiritual, who is 
not in error and the old flesh, who was not born of Adam 
but of the Holy Spirit. And of this Abraham, renewed by 
faith and born again by the Holy Spirit, the Scripture 
speaks, proclaiming that he shall be the father of many 
nations, likewise that all nations shall be given to him for 
an inheritance, saying, "In thee shall all nations be 
blessed." 

194. This is supported by Paul from the Scripture, 
which says, Gen. 15, 6: "Abraham believed the Lord" 2c. 
Consequently, the Scripture ascribes righteousness to 
Abraham only because he stands in faith, and speaks of 
such an Abraham as he is before God. Therefore, by 
such sayings of Scripture, a new Abraham is painted 
before our eyes, quite apart from his marital status, 
marriage bed, and fleshly procreation, and he is 
portrayed as he is before God, namely, as a believer who 
is justified by faith, and to whom God, because he 
believes, promises: "You shall become a father of many 
nations" and: "In you all nations shall be blessed." Of this 
Paul says that the Scriptures foreknew it and cast down 
all glory and boasting of the law to the Jews, because 
the Gentiles were given to Abraham for an inheritance, 
not by the law and by circumcision, but long before, 
through the righteousness of faith alone. 

195. Therefore the boast of the Jews is null and void, 
that they want to be called blessed because they are the 
seed and children of Abraham. Before the world it is a 
great privilege and a glorious glory to be Abraham's 
seed, Rom. 9, 4. f., but not equally before God. That is 
why the Jews pervert this passage of blessing in an 
ungodly way, since they only refer to the bodily blessing. 





The Bible obviously speaks of the spiritual blessing 
before God, and it cannot and must not be understood 
otherwise. This, then, is the opinion of the saying, "In 
thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed." In what "thee"? In 
"thee," believing Abraham, or in thy faith, or in the future 
Christ (thy seed), in whom thou believest, | say, shall all 
the Gentiles be blessed; that is, all the Gentiles shall be 
thy blessed children, as thou art blessed, as it is written 
[Gen. 15:5.], "So shall thy seed be." 

It follows that Abraham's blessing and faith is the 
same as ours, that Abraham's Christ is the same as ours, 
that Christ died for Abraham's sins as well as ours, as 
John 8:56 says: "Abraham saw my day and rejoiced. So 
it is all the same. Therefore, the Jews must in no way be 
allowed to weaken and pervert the word "blessing." They 
look at the Scriptures through the cover, therefore they 
do not pay attention to what or whereof is dealt with in 
the promises made to the fathers. But it is precisely to 
this that we must pay the most attention, and then we will 
see that God spoke to the patriarch Abraham, not of the 
law or of what he should do, but of what he should 
believe, that is, that God spoke to him of the promises 
made in faith. What does Abraham do? He believes 
these promises. What does God do to Abraham who 
believes? He counts faith to him as righteousness and 
adds several promises [Gen. 15, 1.]:""| am your shield", 
[Gen. 12, 3.:] "In you all generations on earth shall be 
blessed", [Gen. 17, 4.:] "You shall become a father of 
many nations", [Gen. 15, 5.:] "So shall your seed 
become." These reasons are insurmountable, and no 


one can break them off (Cavillari), if one only pays 


careful and serious attention to the sayings of the 
Scriptures. 


V. 9. So now those who are of faith will be blessed 
with the believing Abraham. 

197 The emphasis is on the words: "with the 
believing Abraham", and everything depends on the 
same. Because he makes open- 


324 Lri. Kai. 1, 353-355. Explanation of Galatians 3, 9. W. VIII, 2080-2084. 


325 





He makes a distinction between Abraham and Abraham 
by making two out of one person, as if to say: The one is 
the Abraham who deals with works, the other is the 
believing Abraham. We have nothing to do with the one 
who does works. For [Rom. 4:2], "If Abraham is justified 
by works, he has glory, but not before God." The Jews 
may always boast of Abraham, who begets children, who 
does works, who is circumcised and has the law. We 
boast of the believing Abraham, of whom the Scripture 
says that he received the blessing of righteousness 
through his faith, not only for himself, but that this 
blessing should also pass on to all who believe like him, 
and so the world is promised to the believing Abraham 
[as an heir]. So the whole world is blessed, that is, it 
receives the imputation of righteousness, if it believes 
like Abraham. 

Therefore the blessing is nothing else than the 
promise of the gospel, and "that all the Gentiles should 
be blessed" is that all the Gentiles should hear the 
blessing, or that the spiritual blessing, that is, the divine 
promise through the gospel should be preached and 
spread among all the Gentiles. And from this passage 
the prophets, through their spiritual understanding, have 
drawn many prophecies, 1) as, Ps. 2:8: "Cry unto me, 
and | will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and 
the end of the wager for thine own possession"; and Ps. 
19:5: "Their cord goeth forth into all the earth, and their 
speech unto the end of the wager." In short, all the 
prophecies of Christ's kingdom and of the spread of the 
gospel throughout the Wett flowed from this passage: "In 
you shall be blessed. "2c. Therefore, "that the Gentiles 
may be blessed" means that righteousness is given to 
them and they are counted righteous, not by the law, but 
by the preaching of faith, because Abraham was not 
justified in any other way than by hearing the word of 
promise, blessing and grace. Therefore, just as Abraham 
received the imputation of righteousness through the 
preaching of faith, so Abraham received the imputation 
of righteousness through the preaching of faith. 


1) Instead of citing the following scriptural passages, 
Menius breaks off here briefly: "which would be much too 
long to steel here". 


It happened to all the Gentiles, and it is still happening. 
For the preaching of one and the same God went first to 
Abraham, and then to all the Gentiles. 

From this we see that "blessing" is nothing else than, 
as | said, preaching and teaching the word of the gospel, 
confessing Christ and spreading the knowledge of him 
among all nations, and this is the priestly office and the 
daily sacrifice of the church in the New Testament, which 
distributes this blessing by preaching, administering the 
sacraments, absolving, comforting and acting on the 
word of grace, which Abraham had and which was his 
blessing. Believing this, he received the blessing. In the 
same way, we are blessed when we believe the same. 

But this blessing is a glory, not before the race, but 
before God. For we hear that our sins are forgiven, and 
that we are accepted by God in grace, and that God is 
our Father, we His children, whom He does not want to 
anger, but to free from sin, death and all evil, and to give 
us righteousness, life and eternal bliss. 

Of this blessing, as | have said, the prophets preach 
everywhere, who did not regard the promises given to 
the fathers coldly, as the godless Jews and today's 
sophists and enthusiasts do, but read and considered 
them with the utmost diligence, and drew from them all 
that they prophesied about Christ and his kingdom. Thus 
the prophecy Hosea, Cap. 13, 14: "I will save them from 
death. Death, | will be a poison to you," 2c., and similar 
ones in other prophets, all flowed from these promises, 
in which God promised the fathers that the serpent's 
head would be crushed and that blessings would come 
upon all the Gentiles. 

Furthermore, if the Gentiles are blessed, that is, if 
they are counted righteous before God, then it follows 
that they are free from sin and death and are partakers 
of righteousness, blessedness and eternal life, not 
because of their works, but because of faith in Christ. 
Therefore the passage Genesis 12:3 says: "In you shall 
be blessed 


326 Lri. Kai. 1, 385-357. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2084-2087. 


327 





all generations on earth", as | have said, not of a blessing 
with the mouth, but of such a blessing as to impute 
righteousness, which is valid before God and redeems 
from the curse of sin and from all that sin entails. 

This blessing is only received through faith, for the 
text clearly says: "Abraham believed God" 2c. 
[Therefore, it is a purely spiritual blessing and deserves 
to be called a blessing that is valid before God, even 
though it is blasohemed by the world, as it cannot refrain 
from doing. This, then, is a mighty saying, that those who 
are of faith have a share in this promise of blessing that 
happened to Abraham who believed. And so Paul 
anticipates the reasoning of the Jews, by virtue of which 
they boast of Abraham, who begets children, does 
works, and is righteous before men, not of Abraham, who 
believes. 

(204) Just as the Jews take their glory from Abraham, 
who dealt in works, so the pope holds Christ up to us only 
because of the works he does, or the example of Christ. 
He says: Whoever wants to live godly must walk as 
Christ walked, as he himself said John 13:15: "An 
example have | given you, that ye should do as | have 
done unto you." We do not deny that the godly should 
follow Christ's example and do good works, but this does 
not make them righteous before God. Paul is not 
discussing here what we should do, but in what way we 
will be justified. Christ must be held up to us, just as he 
dies for our sins and rises again for the sake of our 
righteousness; and he must be grasped by faith as a gift, 
not as an example. 

Reason does not understand this. Hence it comes 
about that, just as the Jews follow Abraham, provided he 
does works, not in that he believes, so the papists and 
all those who deal with their own righteousness 


(justitiarii) look at Christ and seize him, not as the one 
who justifies, but as the one who does works 
(operantem); and by this they only get further and 
further from 








Christ, of righteousness and salvation. Just as the Jews, 
who were saved, had to follow the faithful Abraham, so 
we, if we want to be free from sins and saved, must take 
hold of Christ in faith as our justifier and savior, just as 
Abraham also took hold of Him and obtained blessing 
through Him. 

206. It was indeed a great glory that Abraham 
received circumcision at God's command, that he was 
adorned with exceedingly great virtues, that he obeyed 
God in all things, as it is also a great praise and a fine 


loving behavior (felicitas), to follow the example of 
Christ, which he gave in his works, as to love one's 
neighbor, to do good to those who offend, to pray for 
one's enemies, and to bear patiently the ingratitude of 
those who repay good with evil. But this serves nothing 
for the attainment of righteousness before God. 


Abraham's glorious good works (benefacta) did not help 
him to be declared righteous before God, so imitating 
Christ's example does not make us righteous before 
God. For for us to be righteous before God requires a far 
more precious treasure than human righteousness or 
righteousness from the law. Here we must have Christ 
to bless us and make us blessed, just as Abraham had 
him as a blessing-giver and blessedness-maker. How? 
Not by works, but by faith. 

(207) Therefore, just as the believing Abraham is 
something quite different from the one who does works, 
so also the blessing and redeeming Christ is something 
quite different from the one who does works, or, to put it 
this way, from the one who sets an example 


(exemplaris). But here Paul deals with the redeeming 
Christ and with the believing Abraham, not with Christ as 
an example and with Abraham as far as he does works. 
Therefore he adds meaningfully and with great 
emphasis: "Those who are of faith are blessed with the 
faithful Abraham. 

Therefore, the believing Abraham must be separated 
from the one who does works as far as heaven and 
earth. The believer is completely a divine man, a child of 
God, the heir of the earth, the overcomer of the 


328 Ari. "Li. I, 387-389. 


Exec. Explanation of Galatians 3, 9. 10. W. VIII, 2087-2093. 


329 





world, sin, death, the devil 2c. Therefore, he cannot be 
praised enough. We do not want to leave this faithful 
Abraham hidden in the grave, as he is hidden from the 
Jews, but we want to praise him and fill heaven and earth 
with his name, so that before this faithful Abraham we 
see nothing at all of the Abraham who does works. For if 
we speak of the believing Abraham, we are in heaven, 
but if we then do the same works that Abraham did, 


insofar as he did works (Abraham operans) that were 
human and earthly, not divine and heavenly (except 
insofar as they were given to him by God), then we have 
our walk among men on earth. Therefore the believing 
Abraham fills heaven and earth. So every Christian fills 
heaven and earth with his faith, so that he shall see 
nothing apart from it. 


209 From this word: "they are blessed" Paul takes 
another reason for proof, which flows from the opposite 


(a contrario). For the Scriptures are full of contrasts, and 
a man who deals with the Scriptures in the right way 
(ingeniosi hominis est) must pay attention to the 
contrasts in them and by them explain their sayings, as 
here the word "blessing" immediately causes one to 
consider the opposite, namely, the curse. 1) For since 
the Scripture says that all nations are blessed in faith or 
in the believing Abraham, it follows with necessity that 
all, both Jews and Gentiles, are cursed apart from faith 
or apart from the believing Abraham. Since the promise 
was made to Abraham that in him all nations would be 
blessed, it follows that the blessing cannot be expected 
anywhere else than in the promise made to Abraham and 
now proclaimed to the whole world through the gospel. 
What therefore is outside of it is accursed, and this Paul 
teaches exceedingly clearly, saying: 


1) The following and the greater part of the next 
paragraph is used by Aurifaber for K 76 of the 12th 
chapter of the Table Talks. In our edition of the Table 


Talke thie eantian ic amittad 


V. 10 For those who deal with the works of the law 
are under the curse. 

Here you see that the curse is a kind of flood of sin 
that sweeps away everything that is outside of Abraham, 
that is, outside of the faith and the promise of blessing 
given to Abraham. But if even the law, which was given 
by God's command through Moses, subjects to the curse 
those who are under the law, the laws or statutes 
invented by human reason will do this much more. 
Therefore, whoever wants to escape the curse, let him 
take hold of the promise of blessing or the faith of 
Abraham, or he will remain under the curse. It follows 
from this saying: "In you shall be blessed" 2c. that all 
nations before, under and after Abraham will be cursed 
and remain under the curse forever, if they are not 
blessed in the faith of Abraham, to whom the promise of 
blessing through his seed was given, which was to be 
spread throughout the whole world. 

It is very useful to know this, for it serves to comfort 
the conscience, and also to teach us to distinguish the 
righteousness of faith from the righteousness of the flesh 
lor civil righteousness. For Paul is dealing here with a 
theological and spiritual doctrine before God, not with a 
worldly matter; (this | say,j lest an unskillful man make 
the objection (cavilletur) that he curses and condemns 
the worldly laws and those who administer a magisterial 
office. Jerome labors here, but says nothing to the point, 
and the sophists here are more mute than the fish. 
Therefore, readers must be reminded that here we are 
not dealing with civil laws, customs, and worldly affairs, 
Which are God's order and good things, approved and 
praised by Scripture elsewhere, but with spiritual 
righteousness, by which we are justified before God and 
called God's children in the kingdom of heaven. In short, 
nothing is said here about this life in the flesh, but about 
the eternal life, where no blessing is to be hoped for, nor 
righteousness to be sought through the law or human 
statutes or anything else that is called in this life. 





330 Lri. Oai. 1, 359-362. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2693-2097. 


The only way it can be, is through the promise of blessing 
that was given to Abraham. 

Therefore, the civil laws and ordinances should 
remain in their domain (ordine) and in their place. Even 
if a householder or a magistrate gives the best and most 
beautiful laws, they still cannot free you from the curse 
before God. The kingdom of Babylon, which was 
instituted by God and given to the kings, had very good 
laws, and all the peoples were commanded to obey 
them, but this obedience to the laws did not make them 
free from the curse of the divine law. So we also obey 
the imperial laws, but this does not make us righteous 
before God, for here we are dealing with a different 
matter. 

It is not in vain that | insist so diligently on this 
distinction and sharpen it, for it is very useful to hold it 
fast, although few observe and hold it. Moreover, it is 
easy to mix up heavenly and worldly justice. In worldly 
righteousness, one must look to laws and works, but in 
spiritual, divine and heavenly righteousness, all laws and 
works must be put out of sight, and one must look only 
to the promise and blessing of Abraham, which gives us 
Christ, the giver of blessings, the giver of grace, and the 
Savior, so that spiritual righteousness, without law and 
works, may look solely at the grace and blessings 
offered to us through Christ, as promised to Abraham 
and believed by him. 

From this it is easy to see that this ground of proof is 
very strong. For if the blessing can be hoped for and 
received through Christ alone, then it necessarily follows 
by inference (a contrario) that it is not received through 
the law, because before the law and without the law the 
blessing was given to the believing Abraham. But with 
the same faith with which he believed in the future Christ 
that he would be a giver of blessing (benedictorem), we 
believe in the present Christ, and thus by faith we 
become a giver of blessing. 





331 


Just as Abraham was justified by faith. Therefore, those 
who are under the law are not blessed, but remain 
subject to the curse. 

215 The pope and the bishops cannot and will not 
believe this, nor will they suffer it, but it behooves us not 
to remain silent. For we must confess the truth and say 
that the papacy is cursed, that the emperor's laws and 
rights are cursed, because, as Paul says, everything is 
cursed that is apart from the promise and apart from the 
faith of Abraham. When the adversaries hear this, they 
pervert our words and slander us as if we taught that no 
honor should be paid to the authorities, but stirred up 
sedition against the emperor, condemned all laws, 


dissolved the secular government (respublicas) and 
destroyed it 2c. 

But they do us great injustice, for we make a 
distinction between the bodily and the spiritual blessing, 
and say that the emperor is blessed with a bodily 
blessing; for to have a kingdom, laws, civil orders, to 
possess a wife, children, a house, and fields, is a 
blessing, for these are all good creatures, given by God. 
But through this bodily blessing, which is temporal and 
has an end, we are not freed from the eternal curse. 
Therefore we do not condemn the laws, nor are we 
rebellious against the emperor, but teach that one should 
obey him, fear him, prove honor and submission to him 


(adorandum), but in a civil way (Civiliter). But where we 


as theologians (theologice) speak of the blessing, we 
constantly say with Paul that everything that is apart from 
the promise and faith of Abraham is cursed and remains 
under the heavenly and eternal curse. For there we must 
wait for another life after this present life, and another 
blessing after this bodily. 

In short, we say that all corporeal things are good 
creatures of God. Therefore, to have a wife, children and 
property, to have laws, worldly orders and ceremonies, 
these are divine blessings in their place, that is, they are 
temporal blessings. 


382 Lri. Oai. 1, 362-*64. Exec. Explanation of the Gaelic letter 3, 10. W. vm, 2097-2101. 


333 





The blessings that belong to this life. But the works 
saints of all times, the Jews, Papists, Rotten 2c. confuse 
this and mix it up, because they do not distinguish 
between bodily and spiritual blessings. Therefore they 
say: We have the law, it is good, holy and righteous, so 
we are made righteous by it. Who denies that the law is 
good 2c.? But it is also a law of curse, sin, wrath and 
death. 

Therefore, make a distinction here between the 
physical and the spiritual blessing, and say: God has a 
twofold blessing, a physical one for this life, and a 
spiritual one for eternal life. Therefore we say that 
goods, having children 2c. is a blessing, but in its place 


(gradu), that is, for the present life. 

It is not enough for eternal life that we have bodily 
blessings, for these are most abundantly bestowed upon 
the wicked; it is not enough that we have civil and legal 
righteousness, for this is also most abundant among the 
wicked. God scatters these gifts of his freely throughout 
the world, over the evil and the good, as he makes his 
sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the 
righteous and the unrighteous [Matth. 5, 45], for he is 
"rich above all" [Rom. 10, 12], and it is a small thing to 
him that he throws all created things under the feet of 
the wicked. Rom. 8:20: "The creature is subject to vanity 
without its will." Therefore, those who have only these 
bodily blessings are not God's children, blessed before 
God spiritually, like Abraham, but they are under the 
curse, as Paul says: "Those who deal in the works of the 
law are under the curse." 

220 Paul could have used a general expression and 
said: Everything that is apart from faith is under the 
curse. He does not do this, but takes what is best apart 
from faith, the greatest and most beautiful of the bodily 
blessings of the world, namely the law of God. This law, 
he says, is indeed holy and given by God, yet it does 
nothing other than subject all men to the curse and keep 
them under the curse. If 


but the divine law subjects men to the curse, the lesser 
laws and blessings do this much more, and in order that 
one may understand correctly and clearly what Paul 
means when he says: to be under the curse, he proves 
and explains this with a testimony of the Scriptures, 
saying: 


For it is written: Cursed be every man that 
continueth not in all things which are written in the 
book of the law to do them. 


With this testimony, which is taken from the fifth book 
of Moses, Cap. 27, 26, Paul wants to prove that all who 
are under the law or the works of the law are cursed, or 
under the curse, that is, under sin, the wrath of God, 
eternal death and all evil. For he speaks, as | said 
above, not of a physical or temporal curse, but of a 
spiritual and eternal curse, which must necessarily be a 
curse of eternal death and hell. 

222 And this is a strange proof, because Paul proves 


the affirmative saying (affirmativam), namely: "Those 
who deal with the works of the law are under the curse" 


by this negative sentence (negativam), which he 
borrowed from Moses: "Cursed be everyone who does 
not remain in all this" 2c. These two sayings of Paul and 
Moses are completely contrary to each other. Paul says: 
Whoever does the works of the law is cursed; Moses 
says: Whoever does not do the works of the law is 
cursed. 

Now how can these be brought into agreement with 
each other, or, what is even more, how can the one 
saying be proven by the other? Dear, what kind of proof 
would it be if | wanted to prove this saying: If you keep 
the commandments of God, you will enter into life, by 
this one: If you do not keep the commandments of God, 
you will enter into life? Am | not proving something by 
the very opposite? Truly a beautiful proof! and yet this 
proof of Paul is completely similar to it. No one 
understands this passage unless he has a righteous 
grasp of the article of justification. Jerome takes enough 
trouble, but leaves this passage unexplained. 


334 Lri. Oai. 1, 364-366. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2101-2164. 


There is no doubt that Paul has explained this saying 
in more detail to the Galatians, otherwise the Galatians 
would not have understood what Paul meant by it, since 
he only touches on it here in passing and briefly. But 
because they had heard it interpreted by Paul before, 
they are reminded of it now, and they immediately 
remember it again. 

(225) These two sayings do not conflict with each 
other, but are in complete agreement. For we also teach 
in the same way: "Not the hearers of the law are 
righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be 
righteous," Rom. 2:13, and again: "Those who deal with 
the works of the law are under the curse. For the article 
of justification says, "All that is apart from the faith of 
Abraham is accursed. And yet "righteousness, required 
by the law, must be fulfilled in us," Rom. 8:4. This seems 
to a man who does not understand the doctrine of faith 
to be most strongly opposed to one another, and not at 
all different from this quite inconsistent saying: If you 
fulfill the law, you do not fulfill it; if you do not fulfill it, you 
fulfill it. 

226 Therefore, one must first of all look at what kind 
of matter Paul is dealing with here, what he is dealing 
with and how he looks at Moses. But, as | have often 
said, he is dealing with a spiritual matter that has nothing 
to do with the world regiment and all laws, and he looks 
at Moses with different eyes than the hypocrites and the 
false apostles do, and interprets the law spiritually. 
Therefore all power lies in the word "do". But to do the 
law is not merely to do it outwardly, but to do it rightly 
and perfectly. 

227 There are, then, two kinds of law: one is that 
which deals with the works of the law, against which 
Paul acts and fights in this whole epistle; the other is that 
of faith, of which we shall speak shortly. But to be of the 
law, or to deal with the works of the law, and to be of 
faith, these are completely opposite things, as the devil 
and God, sin and righteousness, death and life are 
opposite. For of the law are those who by the 





335 


Those who want to be justified by the law are those who 
rely on faith to be justified by mercy for Christ's sake 
alone. He who says that righteousness is of faith curses 
and condemns the righteousness of works. On the other 
hand, he who says that righteousness is of the law 
condemns and curses the righteousness of faith. So 
they are directly opposed to each other. 

He who observes this easily recognizes that doing the 
law is not merely outwardly, as the hypocrites dream, 
but in spirit, that is, that one does in truth and perfectly 
what is commanded in the law. But where will we find 
such a one who does the law in such a way? Let him be 
provided for us, and let us praise him. Then our 
opponents immediately answer [Rom. 2:13], "Those 
who do the law will be righteous." Quite well, but first let 
us determine who these are who do it. They are called 
the one who does the work of the law and thus becomes 
righteous through the preceding works. This is not what 
Paul means by doing the law, for, as | have said, these 
are two opposite things, dealing with the works of the 
law and being of faith. Therefore, to be justified by the 
works of the law is to deny the righteousness of faith. 

Therefore, by doing the law, the saints of works deny 
the righteousness of faith, and sin against the first, 
second and third commandments and against the whole 
law, because God commanded 1) that one should serve 
Him in faith and in fear of Him. On the other hand, 
without faith and against faith, they make righteousness 
out of works. So just by doing the law, they do most 
against the law and sin most grievously and most 
grievously, for they deny God's righteousness, mercy, 
and promises, deny Christ with all His benefits, and set 
up in their hearts a mere fiction and idol of the law, but 
not the righteousness of the law which they do not 
understand, much less 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: praecipit instead of: praecepit. 


336 


do. Therefore it is inevitable that by doing the law they 
not only do not do it, but also sin and deny the divine 
majesty in all its promises. The law is certainly not given 
for this. 

Therefore, those who do not understand the law 
abuse it, and as Paul says in Romans 10:3: "They do not 
know the righteousness that is before God, and seek to 
establish their own righteousness, and so are not 
subject to the righteousness that is before God. For they 
are blind and do not recognize what is to be had from 
faith and from the promises. That is why they enter into 
the holy Scriptures completely without any judgment, 
and take hold of only one part of them, namely the law. 
They think they can fulfill this with works. But this is a 
mere dream, an enchantment and deception of the 
heart, and that righteousness of the law which they think 
they are fulfilling is in truth nothing but idolatry and 
blasphemy against God. Therefore, they must 
necessarily remain under the curse. 

Therefore it is impossible that we should fulfill the law 
in this way, as they dream, much less that we should be 
justified by it. This is testified first of all by the law itself, 
which has the completely opposite effect. For it 
increases sin, incurs wrath, accuses, terrifies, and 
condemns; how, then, should it make just? Secondly, 
the promise also proves the same, for it was said to 
Abraham, "In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed." 
Therefore the blessing is nowhere else but in the 
promise made to Abraham; if you are outside of it, you 
are and remain under the curse. But if you are under the 
curse, you do not fulfill the law, because you are under 
sin, the devil, and eternal death, for all these certainly 
follow the curse. 

In short, if righteousness came through the Law, 
God's promise would be in vain, and in vain He poured 
out His blessing. Therefore, because God knew that we 
cannot do the law, He foresaw this long before the law, 
and promised the promise to Abraham, saying, "In 





Li-1. 6ai. 1, 366-368. Explanation of Galatians 3, 10. W. VII, 2104-2108. 337 


to thee shall all nations be blessed," 2c., and thus 
testified that all nations were to obtain the blessing not by 
the law but by the promise given to Abraham. Therefore 
those are cursed who despise the promise, and take the 
law for the sake of it, that they may be justified by it. 

Therefore, "to do the law" is first of all (primum) to 
believe, and thus to fulfill the law through faith. We must 
first receive the Holy Spirit, by whom enlightened and 
renewed we begin to do the Law, that is, to love God and 
neighbor. The Holy Spirit, however, is not received 
through the Law (for those who are under the Law, says 
Paul, are under the curse), but through the preaching of 
faith, that is, through the promise. We must be blessed 
with Abraham, and through his faith in the promise. 
Therefore, first of all, one must hear the promise that 
holds out Christ and brings him to those who believe; 
when he is taken in faith, the Holy Spirit is given for his 
sake. Then God and one's neighbor are loved, good 
works are done, one takes up one's cross. This is doing 
the law in truth; otherwise the law remains unfulfilled for 
eternity. 

234 Therefore, if you want to describe clearly what it 
means to do the law, it is nothing other than to believe in 
Jesus Christ and, having received the Holy Spirit through 
faith in Jesus Christ, to do the works contained in the law. 
And in no other way can the law be done by us, because 
the Scripture says that apart from the promise there is no 
blessing, not even in the law. Therefore, it is impossible 
for the law to be kept without the promise. There must be 
the blessing, which is the preaching of Christ promised 
to Abraham, that through him the race should be blessed. 
Otherwise we will never do the law. 

Therefore, you cannot find a man in the whole world 
who, apart from the promise of the Gospel, would have 
this title: a doer of the Law. Therefore, the expression 


(terminus) "doer of the law" is a fictitious one, which no 
one understands who is not outside the Law. 


338 Li-I. Osl. i, 368-370. Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. vin, 2108-2111. 


339 





and is above the law in the blessing and faith of 
Abraham, so that a right doer of the law is the one who 
has received the Holy Spirit through faith in Christ, and 
begins to love God and to do good to his neighbor, so 
that the doing includes at the same time the faith that 


brings about (facit) the tree; when this has come about 


(qua facta), then fruits grow. For first the tree must be 
there, then fruits follow. For the fruits do not make the 
tree, but the tree brings forth the fruits. 


236 Thus faith first creates (facit) the person who 
then does works. Therefore, if a man will do the law 
without faith, it is called bringing forth fruit without a tree, 
out of wood and clay; but this is not making fruit, but 
mere mirages. But when the tree is set, that is, the 


person or doer, who comes (fit) from faith in Christ, then 
the works follow. For the doer must be there before the 
deeds, not the deeds before the doer. 

Therefore he is called a doer, not of the works which 
he has done, but of those which he is yet to do, for 
Christians are not justified by doing what is right (justa), 
but, having already been justified by faith in Christ, they 
do right (justa) works. The other, namely, that someone 
becomes a doer through deeds, belongs to the worldly 


life (est politicum), since someone, as Aristotle says, 
becomes a lute-player by playing the lute often. But in 
theology, doers do not arise from works, but from 


persons already prepared (factis) by faith become 
people who do works. Paul speaks of such people in 
Rom. 2, 13, when he says: "Those who do the law 
become righteous", that is, they are counted as 
righteous. 

238 Yes, even the sophists themselves must 
confess, and they also teach in this way, that a moral 
work which is done outwardly is hypocritical if it is not 
done out of a sincere heart, good will and right guidance 
of reason. And that is why the saying arose among the 
Germans: The cap 





covers many a rogue. For an ungodly man, even the 
most wicked, can pretend to do the same works that a 
godly man does by faith. Judas did the same works as 
the other apostles. What is lacking in the works of Judas, 
since he does the same things that the other apostles 
do? Then a sophist answers from his moral philosophy: 
Although he does the same works that the others do, yet 
his works, because his person was rejected and what his 
reason gave him (dictamen) was wrong, are hypocritical 
and not right works like those of the other apostles, 
however similar they look to them in outward 
appearance. 

Therefore they themselves must admit that in worldly 
and external things works do not justify unless there is a 
righteous heart, good opinion and good will. How much 
more must they admit this in theology, where above all 
there must be the knowledge of God and faith that 
purifies the heart. 

240 They walk in the works and righteousness of the 
law, as Judas did in the works of the apostles, but they 
do not understand what they say or what they establish. 
And although Paul everywhere says in clear words that 
the law does not justify, but only causes wrath, indicates 
sin, reveals the wrath and judgment of God, and 
threatens eternal death, they do not see this when they 
read it, much less understand it. Therefore, they are not 
worthy to be called hypocrites, but they are larvae and 
ghosts, and completely bewitched, dreaming that they 
are righteous by the works of the law. Therefore, as | 
said, "doers of the law," as they describe it, is a fictitious 


expression and a monstrosity that does not exist 
anywhere in reality. 

‘Therefore, when Paul proves this passage, "Those 
who deal with the works of the law are under the curse," 
by this saying of Moses, "Cursed be everyone," 2c., he is 
not proving his case by something that is just contrary to 
it, as it seems at first sight, but his proof is entirely 


1) The following two paragraphs have been added by 
Menius and otherwise modified. 


340 Lri. 1, 37U-373. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 10. W. VIII, 2111-2116. 


341 





right and in the best way. For Moses has the same 
opinion and claims the same as Paul, saying: "Cursed be 
everyone who does not do it" 2c. But no one does it. 
Therefore all those do not do the law who deal with the 
works of the law. But if they do not, they are under the 
curse. 

242 But since there are two kinds of offenders of the 
law, as | have said, right and hypocritical, the right must 
be separated from the hypocritical. The right ones are 
those who are a good tree by faith before they bear fruit, 
and the wrongdoers before they do works. Moses also 
speaks of these, and if they are not of this nature, they 
are under the curse. But all hypocrites are not of this kind, 
for they think that they will bring about righteousness by 
their works, and by them make the person righteous. For 
they think thus: We sinners and unrighteous want to 
become righteous. How? By works. Therefore they act 
just like a foolish master builder who strives to make the 
foundation out of the roof and the tree out of the fruit. For 
since they seek to be justified by works, they want to 
make a valley out of the works, which is contrary to 
Moses, who subjects such an offender to the curse in the 
same way as Paul. 

Therefore, those who undertake to fulfill the law not 
only do not keep it, but also, as | have said, deny the first 
commandment, the divine promises, the promised 
blessing of Abraham, deny the faith, and seek to bless 
themselves with their own works, that is, to make 
righteous, to free from sin and death, to overcome the 
devil, and to seize heaven by force: that is, to deny God 
outright and put themselves in God's place. For all these 
are works of the divine majesty alone, not of a creature, 
neither of an angel nor of a man. 

Therefore, Paul could easily predict from the first 
commandment that there would be abominations that 
would be introduced into the church by the Antichrist. For 
those who teach that apart from the worship of the first 
commandment, which is fear, faith and love toward God, 
another worship is necessary for salvation, 





They are Antichristi and take the place of God. That such 
people would come was also foretold by Christ, Matth. 
24, 5. where he says: "Many will come in my name, 
saying: | am Christ. 

Thus, today we can also say, as with [great] ease, so 
also with [complete] certainty: Whoever, outside of faith, 
stabs righteousness by works, denies God and makes 
himself God, for he thinks this way: If | will do this work, 
| will be righteous, | will be a victor over sin, death, the 
devil, God's wrath and hell, and | will obtain eternal life. 
What, | pray you, is this but presuming the work that is 
God's alone, and pretending to be God? Therefore, we 
can easily prophesy, and certainly judge of all those who 
are outside the faith, that they are not only idolaters, but 
idols themselves, who deny God and put themselves in 
God's place. For the same reason Peter also 
prophesied, when he says [2 Petr. 2, 1.]: "There will be 
false teachers among you, who will deny the Lord who 
bought them" 2c. 

In the Old Testament, too, all prophecies against 
idolaters flowed from the first commandment. For all 
godless kings and prophets did nothing else with the 
unbelieving people than what the pope and _ all 
hypocrites always do. For after the first commandment 
and the worship ordered by God had been set aside, and 
the promise of the seed of Abraham, the future giver of 
blessings to all nations, had fallen into contempt, they 
instituted a godless worship without and against God's 
word, saying: If this service is observed, we praise and 
serve GOD who brought us out of Egypt land. So 
Jeroboam made two golden calves and said [1 Kings 
12:28.], "Behold, there are your gods, O Israel, who 
have brought you out of Egypt land." This he said of the 
true GOtte who had redeemed Israel, and yet they, he 
and all the people, were idolaters because they served 
GOt differently than He had commanded in the first 
commandment. 

247. for they looked only at the work [which they were 
doing,] and thought that if this was 


342 Lri. "ai. 1, 373-375. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. viil, 2115-2118. 


343 





they would be righteous before God; but that would mean 
denying the very God of whom they preached with their 
mouths that He had brought them out of Egypt. Of such 
idolaters Paul says [Tit. 1, 16.]: "They say they know 
GOD, but with their works they deny it." 

For this reason, all hypocrites and_ idolaters 
undertake to do the works that actually belong to the 
Godhead, and which belong to Christ alone. They do not 
say with their mouths: | am God; | am Christ; but in so 
doing they do indeed arrogate to themselves the deity 
and office of Christ. Therefore they say with their mouths: 
| am Christ, | am a savior, not only for myself but also for 
others. This is what the monks not only taught, but also 
persuaded the whole world of, namely, that by their 
hypocritical holiness they could not only make 
themselves righteous, but also others to whom they 
would communicate the same, while Christ's own office 
alone is to make a sinner righteous. Thus the pope, by 
spreading his divinity over the whole world, completely 
denied and suppressed the ministry and divinity of Christ. 

It is of great use to remember and consider this, for it 
serves to judge all Christian doctrine and human life; it 
serves to fortify consciences, to understand all 


prophecies and sayings of the Scriptures, and to judge 
all things rightly. For whoever holds on to this can make 
the certain judgment that the pope is the antichrist, 
because he teaches a completely different worship than 
the first tablet presents; he can certainly understand what 
it is to deny God, to deny Christ, and what Christ means 
when he says [Matth. 24, 5.j: "Many will come under my 
name and say, ‘| am Christ"; what it is, "to be an 
abominable man against God, and to exalt himself above 
all that is called God or worship"; what it is, the Antichrist 
"sits in the temple of God and pretends to be God" [2 
Thess. 2, 4]; what it is [Matth. 24, 15], "the abomination 
stands in the holy place" 2c. 

250 All these evils come from the fact that the cursed 
hypocrisy is not supported by the divine 





She does not want to be given the right form by God the 
Creator, does not want to be a mere suffering material, 
but wants to work in an active way what she should let 
God work through suffering and should accept from Him. 
Therefore, she makes herself the creator and justifier 
through her works, and despises the blessing promised 
and given to Abraham and his faithful children. 

251 Thus every hypocrite is at the same time the 
substance [which is worked] and the workmaster [who 
works it] (although this is contrary to philosophy, because 
one and the same object cannot act against itself); the 
substance he is because he is a sinner; the workmaster 
because he puts on a cap or chooses some other work 
by which he hopes to earn grace and to make himself 
and others blessed; thus he is at the same time the 
creature and the creator. 

Therefore, no one can say in words what a terrible 
and cursed thing it is to seek righteousness apart from 
the blessings of the law and works. For it is the 
abomination that stands in the holy place, denying God 
and substituting the creature for the Creator. 

Therefore, the doers of the law are not the hypocrites 
who outwardly do the law, but the believers who, having 
received the Holy Spirit, fulfill the law, that is, love God 
and their neighbor, so that a doer of the law is not the 
one who becomes a doer through works, but the one who 
becomes a doer through the person who is already 
prepared through faith. For in theology those who have 
become righteous do righteous acts, but not also in 
philosophy, where those who do righteous acts become 
righteous. Therefore, after we have been justified by 
faith, we do good works, by which, as it is said in 2 Peter 
1:10, our calling and election are established and 
become more certain day by day. 

254 But because we have only the firstfruits of the 


Spirit, but not yet the fullness (decimas), and there still 
remain remnants of sin in us, we do not fully fulfill the law. 


344 Lri. Kai. 1, 375-377. Explanation of Galatians 3, 10. W. 


VIN, 2118-2122. 345 





common. But this is not imputed to us who believe in 
Christ, who promised to Abraham and blessed us. 
Meanwhile, for Christ's sake, we are nurtured and cared 
for in the bosom of divine patience. We are the wounded 
man who fell among the murderers, to whom the 
Samaritan bandaged his wounds, poured in oil and wine, 
then lifted him up on his animal, led him to the inn and 
nursed him. But when he departed, he commanded him 
to the innkeeper, saying, "Tend him well." In the 
meantime, we are being cared for in a hospital, as it 
were, until the Lord lays His hand on us a second time, 
as Isaiah says, so that He may save us [Isa. 46:4]. 
Therefore the saying of Moses, "Cursed be every 
man that abideth not in all these things," 2c. does not 
argue against Paul, who declares those to be cursed 
who deal in the works of the law. For Moses wants to 
have such a doer, who fulfills the law completely. But 
where shall we get him? Nowhere [do we find such a 
one]. Moses himself confesses that he is not such a one, 
because he says in Ex 34, 7 that no man is innocent 
before God, and David [Ps 143, 2]: "Do not go into 
judgment with your servant" 2c, and Paul Rom 7, 15: "I 
do not do what | want" 2c. Therefore Moses, together 
with Paul, drives us with necessity to Christ, through 
whom we become offenders of the law and [in whom we 
are] not guilty of any transgression. In what way? First, 
through the forgiveness of sin and the imputation of 
righteousness for the sake of faith in Christ, then through 
the gift and the Holy Spirit, who gives birth to a new life 
in us, new impulses, 2c. so that we also fulfill the law in 


its essence (formaliter). But what is not fulfilled is 
forgiven for Christ's sake. Then also what is left of sin is 
not imputed. 

Thus Moses agrees with Paul and has the same 
opinion, saying, "Cursed be everyone," 2c. because he 
denies that they do the law, since they want to make 
themselves righteous by their works, and concludes with 
Paul that they are under the curse. Therefore, Moses 
demands righteous doers who are of faith, just as Paul 
condemns those who are of faith. 





who are not true doers, that is, who are not of faith. So 
there is nothing to prevent Moses from speaking in a 


negative way (negative), but Paul in an affirmative way 


(affirmative), if one only explains correctly what is 
meant by "do". So both sayings are right, namely: that 
all those are cursed who do not remain in all this 2c., 
and: that those are cursed who deal with the works of 
the law. 


Answer from the interjections, 


which the adversaries raise against the doctrine and 
righteousness of the faith. 


257 Since this passage gives occasion to do so, it is 
necessary to speak of the objections which the 
adversaries raise against the doctrine of faith, which is 
this: that we are justified by faith alone. There are many 
passages in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New 
Testaments that deal with works and rewards, on which 
the adversaries rely, and think that through them they 
can violently overthrow the doctrine of faith that we 
teach and defend. Therefore, we must be prepared not 
only to teach our own, but also to answer the objections 
of the adversaries. 

(258) The Sophists, and all who do not hold to the 
article of justification, know no other righteousness than 
temporal and legal, which are also known to some 
extent to the heathen. Therefore they tear out of moral 
philosophy and law the words "do," "work," and the like, 
and transfer them to theology, wherein they not only do 
wrong, but also act quite ungodly. For philosophy and 
theology must be carefully kept apart. 

The Sophists themselves confess and teach that in 
nature there must be existence (esse) rather than action 


(operari), for a tree is in nature rather than fruit. 
Likewise, in philosophy, they admit that a work is not 
morally good unless there is first a right state of reason 
and a good will. So they put right reason and good will 
earlier than good will. 


346 dri. 6si. 1, 377-37S. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2122-2126. 


347 





than the work, thus making the person morally 


(moraliter) just before the work happens. On the other 
hand, in theology, where this should happen before 
anything else (so stupid are the donkeys), they reverse 
this in the most perverse way and put the work rather 
than the righteous reason 2c. 

Therefore, "to do" is something quite different in 
nature than in philosophy, and again something different 
in theology. In nature, first there must be the tree, then 
the fruit. In moral philosophy, "doing" requires a good will 
and a reason that is rightly constituted in relation to the 
action (operandi), and this is where the philosophers 
stop. Therefore, the theologians say that moral 
philosophy does not have God as its object and as its 
final purpose, because Aristotle, or a Sadducee, or a 
civic good man, calls it a rightly constituted reason, and 
a good will, when he seeks the common benefit of the 
state, peaceful life and respectability. 

261 A philosopher or a legislator does not go higher; 
he does not intend to obtain forgiveness of sins and 
eternal life through righteous reason 2c. like a sophist or 
a monk. Therefore, a pagan philosopher is far better 
than such a hypocrite, for he remains within his bounds 
and has only an honorable life and public tranquility in 
mind, but does not mix the human and the divine. On the 
other hand, a sophist imagines that God looks at his 
good opinion and his works, and therefore mixes the 
human and the divine, defiles the name of God, and 
draws this imagination from moral philosophy, only that 
he abuses it worse than a pagan 2c. 

For this reason, in theology we must come much 
higher with the word "do" than in nature and philosophy, 
so that it becomes something entirely new. For just as 
that which is taken out of the domain of nature and 
transferred to the domain of morality becomes 
something else, so much more does that which is 
transferred from philosophy and law to the domain of 
theology become something else, so that here it has a 
completely new meaning and also requires a right 
reason and good will, not in a moral sense, 





but in a theological way, that is, that | recognize and 
believe through the word of the Gospel that God sent His 
only begotten Son into the world to redeem us from sin 
and death. There "to do" is something entirely new, 
unknown to reason, to philosophers, to teachers of the 
law, and to all men, for it is a wisdom hidden in mystery 
2c. Therefore, in theology, a work has faith as its 
necessary precondition. 

263 When the adversaries hold up to you passages 
of Scripture that deal with the law and works, and insist 
on the words "work" and "do," you should answer that 
these are theological words that do not belong to the 
realm of nature or morals. If they are used in the field of 
nature or morals, they are understood according to their 
way, but if they are used in theology, they imply a just 
reason and a good will, of which human reason cannot 
comprehend anything. 

For this reason, "doing" in theology must always be 
understood in terms of believing doing, so that believing 


doing is a different area (circulus) and, as it were, anew 
realm (quite different) from moral doing. Therefore, 
when we theologians speak of doing, we must 
necessarily speak of believing doing, because in 
theology we have no justified reason and no good will 
apart from faith. 

This rule is beautifully observed in the 11th chapter 
of the Epistle to the Hebrews. There many and various 
works of the saints are enumerated from the holy 
scriptures, as, from David, who killed the lion and the 
bear and slew Goliath. There, a sophistical ass in bad 
taste looks only at the outward appearance of the work, 
like the cow at a new Thor. But this work must be 
regarded in such a way that you first pay attention to how 
the person of David was before he did this work, namely 
in such a way that his heart trusted in the Lord, the God 
of Israel, as the text [1 Sam. 17, 37.] clearly says: "The 
Lord, who delivered me from the lion and the bear, he 
will also deliver me from this Philistine." After that [v. 45- 
47.]: "You 


348 Lri. Kai. 1, 379-382. Explanation of Galatians 3, 10. W. 


You come to me with sword, spear and shield; but | come 
to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the 
testimony of Israel, which you have heard. This day the 
LORD will deliver thee into mine hand, that | may smite 
thee, and take away thy head from thee," 2c., "for the 
LORD helpeth not by sword nor by spear," 2c. So you 
see that he was righteous and pleasing to God, strong 
and steadfast in faith, before he did this work. Therefore, 
David's "doing" is not natural or moral, but faithful. 
Thus, the same epistle [Heb 11:4] says of Abel that 
he offered a better sacrifice in faith than Cain. When the 
sophists come upon this passage, as it is read in the first 
book of Moses (where it is simply described that both 
Cain and Abel offered sacrifices, and that the Lord 
graciously looked upon Abel and his sacrifice), they 
immediately seize upon these words: "They offered 
sacrifices, and the Lord graciously looked upon the 
sacrifice of Abel," and cry out: There you hear and see 
that God graciously looked upon the sacrifices, so the 
works make righteous. Thus the unclean swine think that 
righteousness is only something brought about by a 


moral act (rem moralem), looking only at the shell of the 
work, not at the heart of the one who does the work, 
whereas even in philosophy they must look not at the 
mere work, but at the good will of the one who does the 
work. Here, however, they only cling to the words: "they 
brought sacrifices", "the Lord looked upon the 
sacrifices", but do not see that the text in the first book of 
Moses clearly says that the Lord first graciously looked 
upon the person of Abel, which pleased Him for the sake 
of faith, and then upon his sacrifices. 

Therefore, in theology we speak of the works, 
sacrifices, gifts and presents that are done in faith 
(fidelibus), that is, that were offered and done in faith, 
as the epistle to the Hebrews interprets it, saying: "By 
faith Abel made a greater sacrifice," [v. 5, "By faith Enoch 
was taken away," [v. 8] "By faith Abraham was 
obedient," 2c. So you have a rule from the 11th chapter 
to the Hebrews, how to answer simple-mindedly to the 
objections raised by the adversaries. 





VIII, 2128-2129. 349 
concerning the law and the works, namely: This work 
has this one or that one done in faith; and thus you solve 
all their objections. 

From this it is evident that in theology a work is of no 
value without faith, but that faith must precede it before 
you can do works. For "without faith it is impossible to 
please God, but he who wants to come to God must 
believe" [Heb. 11:6]. Therefore, the author of the letter 
to the Hebrews says that Abel's sacrifice was better 
because he believed. Therefore, the work or sacrifice of 


Abel was of faith (fidele). On the other hand, Cain, 
because he was godless and a hypocrite, had no faith in 
grace, but only presumption in his own righteousness, 
therefore his work, by which he sought to please God, 
was a hypocritical and unbelieving one. Therefore, the 
adversaries themselves must admit that in all the works 
of the saints faith is presupposed, for the sake of which 
the works are pleasing. Thus, in theology, there is a new 
action, different from the moral one. 

269 Then we also make a distinction between faith in 
this way, that faith is sometimes taken without a work, 
sometimes with a work. For just as a craftsman speaks 
of his material in various ways, and a gardener speaks 
of a tree, sometimes as it is without fruit (nuda), 
sometimes as it bears fruit, so also the Holy Spirit in 
Scripture speaks of faith in various ways, soon (that | say 
so) of faith in and for itself and without relation to other 
things (de fide abstracta vel absoluta), soon of faith 
as it comes into appearance, has to do with other things, 


or has become flesh (de fide concreta, composita seu 


incarnata). Faith is then in and of itself, or without 
relation to other things, when Scripture speaks in and of 
itself (absolute) of justification or of the justified, as may 
be seen in the epistle to the Romans and to the 
Galatians. 

270 But when Scripture speaks of rewards and 
works, it speaks of faith as it relates to other things, 
coming into manifestation or 


350 Lri. Osi. 1, 382-384. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2129-2132. 


351 





became flesh. Of this faith we will cite several examples, 
as [Gal. 5:6:] "Faith worketh by love"; [Luc. 10:28:] "Do 
this, and thou shalt live"; [Matt. 19:17:] "If thou wilt enter 
into life, keep the commandments"; [Gal. 3:12:] "He that 
doeth it shall live by it"; [Ps. 34:15:] "Forsake evil, and do 
good" 2c. In these and similar passages (which are 
innumerable in the Scriptures), where the word "do" is 
mentioned, the Scriptures always speak of faithful doing; 
so that when they say, "Do this, and thou shalt live," they 
intend it to be understood in this way: First of all, be 
careful that you are a believer and have right reason and 
good will, that is, faith in Christ; if you have this, you may 
do good works. 

What is it to be wondered at, then, if this faith that has 
become flesh, that is, the faith that does works, as Abel's 
faith was, or the faithful works are promised merits and 
rewards? Why then should not the Scriptures speak of 
faith in such different ways, since they also speak of 
Christ as God and man in such different ways, namely, 
sometimes of the whole person, sometimes of his two 
natures in particular, either the divine or the human? 
When it speaks of the natures in particular, it speaks of 
Christ in and for himself (absolute). But when it speaks 
of the divine nature, which is united with the human 
nature into one person, it speaks of Christ in his relation 


to humanity and of him who became flesh (de Christo 


composito et incarnat). 
Among the scholastic theologians, the rule of 
communication of attributes (de communicatione 


idiomatum) is quite common, in that the attributes that 
belong to the divinity of Christ are attached to His 
humanity, as can be seen everywhere in Scripture. Luc. 
2, 11. 13. 14. the angel calls the child born of the virgin 
Mary the Savior of men and the Lord, both of angels and 
men, and Cap. 1, 35. "Son of God". Therefore | can say 


But "man" in this sentence is a completely new word, and 
stands, as the Sophists themselves confess, for 
"Godhead"; that is, this God, who became man, created 
all things. Creation is indeed attributed to the Godhead 
alone, because mankind cannot create, and yet it is 
correctly said: Man created, because the Godhead, 
which alone creates, is united with mankind in the flesh, 
and therefore mankind participates with the Godhead in 
the same qualities. Therefore one says rightly and godly: 
This man Jesus has led Israel out of Egypt, he has 
defeated Pharaoh and has done all miracles from the 
beginning of the world 2c. 

Therefore, when the Scripture says: "If you want to 
enter into life, keep the commandments of God," "Do 
this, and you will live," 2c. one must first see what kind 
of halls and doings it is talking about. For in these and 
similar passages, as | have said, she speaks of the faith 
that appears, not of faith in itself; of faith that has to do 
with objects, not of mere or simple faith, and the opinion 
of this passage: "Do this, and thou shalt live" is this: You 
will live because of this believing doing, or: This doing 
will give you life only because of faith. In this way, 
justification is attributed to faith alone, as the creation of 
the Godhead, and yet, as is rightly said: Jesus, the Son 
of Mary, created all things, so also justification is 
attached to faith made flesh or to faithful action. 
Therefore, it is in no way necessary to hold with the 
sophists and hypocrites that works justify in and of 
themselves, and that merits and rewards are promised 
to moral actions, but only to works that proceed from 
faith. 

274 Therefore let us design the Holy Spirit to speak 
in the Scriptures either of faith itself, of mere, simple 
faith, or of that which is manifest, which has to do with 
other things, which became flesh; all that is added to 
works is added to faith. For the works need not be moral 


with complete truth: This child, who lies in the manger (mo- 


and in the womb of the virgin, created heaven and earth, 
he is the HErr of the angels. Here | speak indeed of a 


352 Lri. 6ai. 1, 384-386. Explanation of Galatians 3, 10, W. 


VII, 2132-2136. 353 





raliter), but in a theological way and according to faith. 
In theology, faith should always be the divinity of 
works and should permeate works as the divinity 
permeates humanity in Christ. He who touches the fire in 
a red-hot iron touches the iron. He who has touched the 
skin of Christ has truly touched GOD. Therefore, faith is 


all in all (factotum that | say so) in works. Abraham is 


called faithful because faith so permeates the whole 
Abraham that when | look at him doing works, | see 
nothing of the carnal or working Abraham, but only of the 
faithful Abraham's works. 

| do this so diligently in order to present the doctrine 
of faith clearly, but also so that we may be able to answer 
correctly and easily the objections of the adversaries who 
mix philosophy and theology together and make 
theological works out of moral ones. A theological work 


is a believing work; so also a man in theology (homo 


theologicus) is a believing man, likewise his reason of a 
right nature; the good will, taken theologically, is the 
believing reason and the believing will, so that faith is the 
Godhead in all things, in the work, in the person, and in 
the members, as the only cause of justification, which is 
then also attached to the object with which we have to 
do, because of the source from which this action 


proceeds (triduitur materiae propter formam), that is, 
the: Works because of faith. Eternal and infinite power is 
attributed to the man Christ not because of his humanity, 
but because of his divinity. For the Godhead alone 
created all things without all cooperation of mankind. 
Thus mankind also did not overcome sin or death, but 
the rod, which was hidden under the little worm, over 
which the devil fell, overcame and devoured the devil, 
who wanted to devour the little worm. So mankind alone 
could not have done anything here, but the divinity, which 
was connected with mankind, did it alone, and mankind 
for the sake of divinity. Thus, only the 





Believe and do all things, and yet the same is added to 
works, but for the sake of faith. 
So these words "do" and "work" are to be taken in a 


threefold way: in the external essence (Substantialiter) 
or in the field of nature; in a moral way; and in a 
theological way (the Sophists also invented certain 
neutral works, which they said were neither good nor 
evil). In the external essence (substantiis) or nature, 
and in the field of morals, these words are taken, as | 
have said, according to their nature and in their natural 
meaning. In theology, however, these become entirely 
new words and acquire a new meaning. Therefore, all 
hypocrites, who want to be justified by the law and have 
false opinions about God, belong to the moral action; 
Paul disputes against them here. For they have a doings 
that flow from a right reason and a good will, which is 
only moral or human. Therefore their works are only in 
the realm of morality or rather of reason. On the other 
hand, the works of the godly are theological, which 
include faith. 

278 Therefore, when you read in the Scriptures about 
the fathers, the prophets and the kings, that they worked 
righteousness, raised the dead, conquered kingdoms, 
2c. then you should remember that such and similar 
sayings are to be interpreted according to the new and 
theological grammar, as the letter to the Hebrews [Cap. 
11, 33. ff.] interprets it, namely in this way: By faith they 
wrought righteousness, by faith they raised the dead, by 
faith they conquered kings and kingdoms, so that faith 
incorporates and informs. 

279 And this the adversaries, if they are otherwise in 
their senses, cannot deny, nor have they anything to say 
or object to. They can of course cry out that Scripture 
often speaks of doing and working, but we constantly 
reply that it speaks of believing. For reason must first be 
enlightened by faith before it can do works; but when one 
has the right opinion and knowledge of God, as it were 
asa 


354 Lri. Kai. 1, 386-388. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2136-2139. 


355 





right reason, then also the work comes into life 
(incarnatur) and is incorporated into faith, so that 
everything that is attached to faith can then also be 
attached to the works, but only for the sake of faith. 

280 It is therefore very useful that those who study 
theology learn to distinguish between right and wrong, 
moral and theological. For those who do this will easily 
be able to explain all the passages that seem to establish 
the righteousness of works. But the right action, as | have 
said, is the believing or theological action, which he who 
seeks to attain righteousness from works does not have. 

Therefore, everyone who deals with the works of the 


law (legis operator) and every moral saint is cursed, 
because he goes against God in presumption of his own 
righteousness, wanting to be justified by human will and 
human reason, and in this way does not fulfill the law by 
fulfilling it. This is what Paul calls "being under the works 
of the law", that is, that the hypocrites do the law, and yet 
by their "doing" they do not do it, because they 
understand doing according to the moral expression 


(grammaticam), which does not apply in theology. They 
do many works, but out of their own presumption without 
righteous reason and without good will as required by 
theology, that is, without knowledge of God and faith, like 
the Pharisee, Luc. 18, 11, 12, and Paul before his 
conversion. Therefore they are blind and err and remain 
under the curse. 

Therefore, | remind you again that the sayings which 
the adversaries bring up from the Scriptures about works 
and rewards are always to be interpreted in a theological 


way by the right theological explanation (by definition). 
As, when this saying from Daniel is held up to us, Cap. 
4, 24: "Loose yourself from your sins by doing good to 
the poor,” one must immediately consult the grammar, 
not the moral, but the theological one. This will show that 
this unburdening is not a moral, but a believing one, that 
is 





means that it includes faith. For a work in the holy 
scriptures also presupposes good will and righteous 
reason, not the moral, but the theological, which is faith. 
In this way you can easily shut up the sophists. For they 
themselves must admit, because they teach thus from 
Aristotle, that every good work must flow from free 
choice. If this is true in philosophy, then much more in 
theology, before a work, the good will and the right 
reason must be there through faith. And this is the 
opinion of all imperative words, likewise of all words that 
teach the law, as the epistle to the Hebrews Cap. 11, 4 
clearly states: "Through faith Abel made a greater 
sacrifice" 2c. 

Nevertheless, although this solution would not be 
sufficient, although it is quite certain, this is still the main 
argument, and the main attention of Christians should be 
directed against all challenges and objections, not only of 
the adversaries, but also of the devil himself, so that they 
seize the head, namely Christ. Then, even if the sophists 
are more perspicacious than | am, and so overwhelm and 
trick me with their arguments for works against faith that 
| could not wriggle out of it altogether (although this is 
impossible for them), | would rather give glory to Christ 
alone and believe in him than be moved by all the 
passages of Scripture which they might bring up against 
the doctrine of faith to establish righteousness by works. 

Therefore, they must be answered simply like this: 
Here is Christ, there are the testimonies of the Scriptures 
concerning the law and works. But Christ is the Lord over 
the Scriptures and over all works; the same is also the 
Lord over heaven and earth, over the Sabbath, temple, 
righteousness, life, wrath, sin, death, and over 
everything, and of this Paul, his apostle, preaches that he 
has become sin and a curse for me. So | hear that in no 
other way could | be done away with sin, death and my 
curse than through his death and blood. Therefore, | 
conclude with the utmost certainty 


356 ttai. 1, 388 f. Il, | f. Executed. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 10. 11. W. VIII, 2139-2143. 


357 





and most certain, that Christ himself in his body had to 
overcome my sin, death and curse, not the works of the 
law or my works. 

But reason, as it is by nature, must also applaud this 
and say that Christ is not a work of the law or my work, 
that his blood and death is not circumcision, the 
observance of legal customs, much less a cap, a shorn 
plate, fasting, vows, that his victory, which he gave me, 
is not a Carthusian monk. Therefore, if he himself is the 
ransom for my redemption, if he himself has become sin 
and a curse to justify and bless me, | ask nothing of all 
the sayings of the Scriptures, though you raise up a 
thousand for righteousness by works against 
righteousness by faith, and cry out that the Scriptures 
contend against themselves: | have the author and Lord 
of the Scriptures, on whose side | will rather stand than 
believe thee; though it is impossible that the Scriptures 
should be at variance with themselves; this can only 
take place among the senseless and hardened 
hypocrites. But with the godly and prudent it bears 
witness to their Lord. Therefore, see how you reconcile 
the passages of Scripture that you say are at odds with 
each other; | remain with the author of Scripture. 

286. Therefore, if anyone is not sufficiently equipped 
to reconcile or account for such passages of Scripture 
concerning works, and yet has to listen to the vehement 
speeches of the adversaries, who insist mightily on such 
passages, simply give this answer: Thou dost (UIQ€S) 
fall upon the servant, that is, the Scriptures, and that not 
upon the whole Scriptures, nor upon their principal part, 
but only upon some sayings concerning works; this 
servant | leave to thee; but | lean upon the Lord, who is 
the King of the Scriptures, who has become my merit 
and my ransom for the attainment of righteousness and 
salvation. | hold on to him and cling to him and leave you 
the works that you have never done. Neither the devil 
nor any saint of works can snatch this responsibility from 
you or overthrow it. Then you are also safe from 





GOD. For the heart remains firmly set on the goal, which 
is Christ, who was crucified and became a curse, not for 
his sake but for ours, as the text [Gal. 3:13] reads, "He 
became a curse for us." Press upon this passage, and 
hold it up against all sayings concerning the law and 
works, and say, Satan, hearest thou not this? Then he 
must depart, because he knows that Christ is his Lord. 


V. 11. But that by the law no one is justified before 
God is evident, for the just shall live by faith. 


This is another reason taken from the testimony of 
the prophet Habakkuk [Cap. 2, 4], and it is a very weighty 
and clear saying that Paul opposes all sayings about the 
laws and works, as if he wanted to say so: What need is 
there of long disputing? Here | bring an exceedingly clear 
testimony of the prophet, from whom no one can take 
anything away: "The righteous will live by his faith." If he 
will live by faith, he will not live by the law, for the law is 
not of faith; and Paul here takes the word "faith" in an 
exclusive way and in opposition [to law and works] 
(exclusive et per contrarium,) ). 

The sophists, as they are ready to distort the 
Scriptures, make the subtle remarks about this passage: 
The righteous man lives by faith, but by faith that works 


(efficaci), that does works, or that has attained its right 
form through love (formica). The righteous lives by faith, 
of course, but by faith that works (efficaci), that does 
works, or that has attained its proper form through love 


(formata caritate). But if faith does not have such form 


(informis), it does not justify. They have invented this 
gloss, and by it they do violence to the words of the 
prophet. 

If by the rightly formed faith they understood the true 
and theological, or as Paul says, the uncolored faith, 
which God calls faith, then this gloss of theirs should not 
be repugnant to me. For then this faith would not be set 
differently from love, but against the vain opinion of faith; 
just as we also make a distinction between the fictitious 
and the true faith. An er- 


358 ari. kai. 11, 2-4. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2143-2147. 


359 





Dense faith is that which hears of God, of Christ, and of 
all the mysteries of the Incarnation and the Redemption, 
and has grasped these things which it has heard, and 
knows how to speak most beautifully of them; and yet it 
remains only a mere delusion and a vain hearing, which 
leaves in the heart only a sound of the Gospel, of which 
it prattles much; but in truth it is not faith, because it 
neither renews nor changes the heart, does not produce 
a new man, but leaves him in his former opinion and 
change. And this faith is very pernicious, and it would be 
better not to have it; and a moral world-wise man is 
better than such a hypocrite who has this faith. 
Therefore, if they distinguished the rightly formed 
faith (fidem formatam) in contrast to the false or 
invented faith, this distinction of theirs would not be 
annoying to me. But they speak of the faith that is rightly 
formed by love, and make a twofold faith, the unformed 
and the rightly formed ((informem et formatam). This 
quite harmful and devilish gloss | have to detest most 
vehemently. For they say: Although there is the infused 
faith, which is a gift of the Holy Spirit, and the acquired 


(acquisita) faith, which we ourselves produce through 
many acts of faith, yet each of these two is unformed 


(informis) and receives its right form through love. 
Thus, faith without love, as they dream, is, as it were, 

a painting and a beautiful thing to look at in the dark, 

which can be seen only when the light that is, love, is 


added. And in this way, love is the essence (forma) of 


faith, and faith is the mere substance (materia) on 
which love works. This means to prefer love to faith and 
to attribute righteousness not to faith but to love, 
because that for the sake of which something has a 
special nature, has itself this nature in a higher degree. 
Therefore, they do not attribute anything at all to faith, 
since they attribute righteousness to faith only for the 
sake of love. 
292. then say the trafficers of the evan 





The Holy Spirit of Christ, that even the infused faith, 
which is not obtained by preaching or by any other 


operation, but which the Holy Spirit creates in man, can 
exist in mortal sin, and that even the very worst of boys 
can have it. Therefore he is idle and useless if he is 
alone, although he does miracles. Thus they take away 
the office of faith altogether and attach it to love, so that 
faith is of no value at all unless that which gives it its 


proper nature (forma) is added, that is, love. Thus, 
according to this harmful fiction of the sophists, that 
wretched virtue, faith, will be a kind of unshaped mass 
(chaos), without works, without efficacy, without life, but 
only a suffering substance. 

All this is blasphemous against God and devilish, 
completely obscuring and overturning the doctrine of 
faith, subtracting from the mediator Christ and from the 
faith that takes hold of him. For if love is the essence 
(lorma) of faith, as they fool, then | must also 
immediately assume that love is the main and greatest 
part of the Christian religion, and so | lose Christ, his 
blood, his wounds and all his benefits, and remain 
attached to love and show love, and come into moral 
action like the pope, a pagan philosopher or a Turk. 

But the Holy Spirit, who gives mouth and speech to 
all men, also knows how to speak. He could well have 
said, as the sophists fool in an ungodly manner, "The 
just shall live by the righteous faith. But with good 
deliberation he has omitted this, and says simply, "The 
just shall live by his faith." Therefore let the sophists go 
to the executioner with their impious and pernicious 
gloss. We want to keep and praise this faith that God 
has called "faith," that is, the true and certain faith that 
does not doubt God, nor the divine promises, nor the 
forgiveness of sins through Christ, so that we can remain 


secure and confident in the one who matters (objecto), 
Christ, and keep in mind the suffering and blood of the 


Mediator and all his benefits. But only the faith that 
believes in Christ 


360 Dri. Oai. II, 4-6. Explanation of Galatians 3, 11. 12. W. 


VII, 2147-2151. 361 





stum, is the only way to keep these things from coming 
out of our faces. Therefore, we must reject this 
pernicious gloss and understand this passage from faith 
alone. And Paul himself shows this by disputing against 


faith formed by love (fidem formatam) as follows: 


V. 12. But the law is not of faith. 


The Sophists say: The righteous lives, if the faith has 
been formed rightly by love; Paul, however, says: "The 
law is not of faith. But what is the law? Is it not also a 
commandment of love? Yes, the law commands nothing 
but love, as the text itself says [Deut. 6:5], "Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart"; likewise [Ex. 
20:6], "| do mercy to many thousands that love me"; 
likewise [Matt. 22:40], "In these two commandments 
hang all the law and the prophets." If therefore the law, 
which enjoins love (Caritatem), contends against faith, 
consequently love is also not of faith. Thus Paul refutes 
quite clearly the fictitious gloss of the sophists about 
faith being made right, and speaks of faith alone, setting 
aside the law. But where the law is removed, love and 
everything that is of the law is also removed, and only 
faith remains, which makes righteous and alive. 

So Paul takes from an exceedingly clear testimony of 
the prophet the reason of proof that in the sight of God 
no one is granted justification and life except the one 
who believes, who obtains righteousness and life 
without the law and without love through faith. This is the 
reason: because the law is not of faith, that is, the law is 
not faith, nor anything of faith, because it does not 
believe; neither are the works of the law faith, therefore 
faith is something distinct from the law, as the promise 
is something distinct from the law. For the promise is 
taken, not by doing works, but by believing. 





Just as in philosophy the essence and the accidental 


quality (substantia et accidens) are distinguished from 
one another by the first division, so also in theology the 
promise and the law, and consequently also faith and 
works, are distinguished from one another as far as 
heaven is from earth. 

It is therefore impossible for faith to be of the law, 
since faith alone is attached to the promise, alone 
receives and knows God, and has to deal with receiving 
good from God. On the other hand, the law and the 
works have to deal with the fact that they demand, 1) do, 
and give to God, as Abel, by sacrificing, gives to God, 
but also, by believing, receives from God. 

So Paul concludes very strongly from the saying of 
the prophet Habakkuk that the righteous man lives by 
faith, and faith alone, because the law has nothing to do 
with faith. For the law is not a promise, but faith clings to 
the promise and is based on it. So as law and promise 
differ, so also works and faith. Therefore, the gloss of the 
sophists is ungodly and false, since it connects the law 
with faith, yes, erases faith and puts the law in the place 
of faith. 

But Paul constantly speaks of those who want to do 
the law in a moral, but not in a theological way. But 
everything that is said about good theological works is 
attributed to faith alone. 


But the person who does it will live through it. 

| understand this part of the saying (particulam) to 
be said ironically, but | do not want to deny that it can 
also be interpreted ina moral way (moraliter), because 
those who do the law as moral people (moraliter), that 
is, without faith, should live by it, that is, should not be 


punished, but should receive bodily rewards through it. 
But | take this passage quite generally like this 


1) exiMndao is missing in the Jenaer and in the Erlanger. 


362 Li. kai. 1, 6-8. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vil, 2isi-2is4. 363 





Christ's saying (Luc. 10, 28.]: "Do this and you will live", 
that it is a kind of irony or mockery: Yes, just do it! 

But Paul wants to show here what exactly and 
actually is the righteousness of the law and that of the 
gospel. The righteousness of the law is: to do the law, 
according to this word: "The man who does it" 2c. The 
righteousness of faith is: to believe, according to this 
word: "The righteous shall live by his faith." That is why 
the law requires us to perform GOtte. But faith does not 
demand works from us, or that we should perform 
anything for God, but that we, as people who believe the 
promise of God, should receive from Him. Therefore, the 
office of the law, where it comes highest, is to do works; 
the office of faith, to assent to the promises, because 
faith is a belief in the promise; a work is a work of the 
law. 

Thus Paul dwells at length on the word "do" in order 
to show clearly which is the righteousness 1) of the law 
and which is that of faith; he contrasts the promise and 
the law, faith and works. He says that nothing else 
follows from the law than doing; faith, however, is 
something completely opposite, namely, it agrees with 
the promise. 

304 Therefore these four pieces must be 
distinguished from each other in the most complete way. 
For just as the law, so also the promise has its proper 
office. To the law belongs "to do," to the promise "to 
believe. So far, then, as the law and the promise, so far 
are doing and believing distinguished, even though you 
wanted to understand doing in a theological way. For 
Paul is dealing with something different here. He insists 
here on the distinction between doing and believing, in 
order to separate love from faith, and to explain that only 
faith justifies, because the law, whether it is done in a 
moral or theological way or not at all, does not contribute 
at all to justification, since the law is only directed to 
"doing", but faith is not of this kind, but something 
completely different, which is required beforehand, 


1) Here the Wittenberg has erroneously: fiducia instead 
Of: justitia. 


before the law can happen; if that is present beforehand, 
then a beautiful union (incarnatio) [of faith and action] 
can take place. 

(305) Therefore faith justifies forever and makes 
alive, and yet it does not remain alone, that is, idle; not 
that it should not remain alone on its scale and in its 
office, because it justifies forever alone, but it takes on 


flesh (incarnatur) and becomes man, that is, it is not 


and does not remain idle or without love. 
Thus Christ, according to the Godhead, is a divine 


and eternal being (substantia) or nature without 
beginning; but mankind is the nature that was created in 
time. These two natures in Christ are unmingled and 
unmixed, and what is peculiar to each must be 
understood differently from the other. It is proper to 
humanity that it began in time; it is proper to divinity that 
it is eternal, without beginning; and yet these two come 
together, and divinity, which has no beginning, is 
incorporated into humanity, which has a beginning. 
How, then, | must distinguish between humanity and 
Deity, and speak: Mankind is not the Godhead, and yet 
man is GOOD, so | distinguish here: Faith is not the law, 
and yet faith does works. So faith and works come 
together in a union (in composito), and yet each has 
and retains its nature and proper office. There you have 
[the reason] why Paul cites this passage here, namely, 
in order to distinguish faith from love in the broadest 
sense. 

Therefore, let us continue (pereant) with the 
sophists with their accursed gloss, and let us condemn 
this word "the formed faith" (fides formata), and let us 
constantly say that these words: the formed faith, the 


unformed faith, the acquired faith (fides formata, 


informis, acquisita) 2c. are the devil's monstrosities, 
which have been brought up to corrupt doctrine and the 
Christian faith, to blaspheme and trample on Christ, and 
to establish the righteousness of works. This is what we 
want to say (I say), so that we may have the true and 
right faith. 


364 Dri. 6-u. II, 8-10. Explanation of Galatians 3, 12. W. VIII, 2154-21S7. 


365 





can be obtained without the works. Works must follow 
faith, but faith must not be works, nor works faith; the 
boundaries and the realm of the law, or of works and 
faith, should not be mixed together, but both should be 
distinguished from each other in the most proper way. 
Therefore, if we believe, we live simply by faith in 
Christ, who is without sin, who, to put it briefly, is our 
covering, our mercy seat, and our forgiveness of sins. 
On the other hand, if we do the law, we do works, but 
we do not have righteousness and life. For the purpose 
of the law is not to justify and make alive, but to signify 
sin and to kill. The law does say: "The man who does 
these things will live by them"; but where is such a man 
who does the law, that is, who loves God with all his 
heart 2c. and his neighbor as himself? So no one does 
the law, no matter how hard he tries to do it; but by doing 
it he does not do it, so he remains under the curse. But 
faith does not "do," but believes in Christ, who justifies. 
Therefore a man lives not for his doing, but for his faith. 
The believer, however, does the law; but what he does 
not do is given to him for Christ's sake through the 
forgiveness of sins, and whatever sin remains is not 
imputed to him. 
So Paul compares the righteousness of the law and the 
righteousness of faith in this passage and Romans 10:4, 
5, by saying, "The man who does it will live by it," as if 
to say, "It would be good if we did the law, but because 
no one does it, we must flee to Christ, who is the end of 
the law; he who believes in Him is righteous. He was put 
under the law so that he might redeem us who were 
under the law [Gal. 4:5]. If we believe in him, we receive 
the Holy Spirit and begin to do the law. But what we do 
not do is not counted to us because of faith in Christ. In 
the life to come, however, we will no longer need faith, 
because we will no longer see God through a mirror in a 





We will not see the dark words as we do now, but face 
to face, that is, there will be the clarity of eternal glory, in 
which we will see God as He is. There will then be a right 
and perfect knowledge and love towards God, a right 
reason and good will, not a moral or theological one, but 
a heavenly, divine and eternal one. Meanwhile, in this 
life we await in the spirit through faith the righteousness 
that must be hoped for. On the other hand, those who 
seek forgiveness of sins through the law, not through 
Christ, never do the law, but remain under the curse. 

So Paul calls only those righteous who are justified 
without the law by the promise or by faith in the promise. 
Therefore, "doing the law" is a fictitious thing that means 
nothing apart from faith. Therefore, those who deal with 
the works of the law, and want to be counted as doing 
the law, do not do it, because the apostle simply 
concludes that all who deal with the works of the law are 
under the curse, under which they would not be if they 
did the law. 

It is true that the man who does it will live, that is, he 
will be blessed; but such a man is nowhere to be found. 
But since the custom of the law is twofold, civil and 
spiritual, whoever wishes may understand this saying in 
a civil way: "He who does it will live by it," that is, if aman 
obeys the authorities outwardly and in the worldly 
regiment, he will escape punishment and death. The 
worldly authorities have no right over him to subject him 
to punishments or to kill him, but let him live unpunished. 
This is the worldly custom of the law, which serves to 
keep the rough people in check. 

But Paul is not dealing with this usage here, but treats 
this passage in a theological way. Therefore, a condition 
is necessarily included, as if he said: If men could do the 
law, they would be blessed. But where are they? 
Therefore, there are no doers of the law, when 


366 Li-I. SLi. II, 10-12. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2157-2163. 


367 





they are not first justified by faith, before the law and 
without the law. 

Therefore Paul, when he curses and condemns those 
who deal with the works of the law, does not speak of 
those who are justified by faith, but of those who seek to 
be justified by works without faith in Christ. | say this for 
the sake of not following the conceit of St. Jerome, who, 
deceived by Origen, understood nothing at all in Paul, 
but regarded him as a civil teacher of the law. Therefore 
he concludes thus: The holy patriarchs, prophets and 
kings were circumcised and sacrificed, thus they 
observed the law. But it would be ungodly to say that 
they are and remain under the curse, so not all who do 
the works of the law are under the curse. Thus he falls 
upon Paul's writings without any judgment and makes no 
distinction between the right doers of the law, who are 
justified by faith, and the doers of works, who seek to be 
justified by the law without faith. 

But Paul does not act here against those who are 
justified by faith and are true doers, because they are not 
people "who deal in the works of the law," but against 
those who not only do not keep the law, but also sin 
against it. For the law commands that we fear, love and 
serve God in faith; this they do not do, but choose new 
services and works which God has not commanded, by 
which God is not reconciled, but only more irritated, 
according to the words [Matt. 15:9]: "In vain do they 
serve me, because they teach such doctrines as are 
nothing but the commandments of men." They are 
therefore unrighteous, robbers of God and idolaters, who 
above all others sin exceedingly grievously against the 
first commandment. Then they also have evil lusts, wrath 
and other exceedingly great passions. In short, there is 
nothing good about them, except that they are outwardly 
righteous in appearance and want to be respected for 
doing the law. 

') 315. Thus we, too, who have gone through the 


1) Here Menius has again inserted a whole paragraph 
of which there is nothing in the Latin. 





We are justified by faith, like the patriarchs, prophets, 
and all the saints, not by "the works of the law," as far as 
justification is concerned. But as long as we are in the 
flesh and still have the remnants of sin in us, we are 
under the law (but not under the curse, because what is 
left of sin is not imputed to us for the sake of Christ in 
whom we believe). For the flesh is under the law of God, 
and the evil desire that still remains in us not only does 
not fulfill the law, but also sins against it, even contends 
against us and takes us captive and makes us slaves, 
Rom. 7:23. 

316. But if in the saints the Law is not fulfilled, but 
many things are done contrary to the Law, since they still 
have evil air, and remnants of sin and many yeasts 
remain, which prevent them 2) from fully fearing and 
loving God, from calling upon Him with certain 
confidence, not praising God enough and not holding His 
word in due honor (venerentur), how much more is this 
true in a person who is not yet justified by faith and 
turned away from God, who with all his heart neglects, 
despises and hates God's word and work! 

317 You see that Paul is speaking of those who want 
to fulfill the law and attain righteousness before they 
have received faith, but not of the fathers and saints, as 
Jerome imagines, who have already been justified by 
faith. 


V. 13. But Christ redeemed us from the curse of 
the law when he became a curse for us (for it is 
written: Cursed be every man that hangeth on the 
tree 2c.). 

318 Here Jerome and the sophists who followed him 
again toil very hard, and they grind down this passage, 
which is exceedingly consoling, most miserably, and, as 
they think, out of a godly zeal, they anxiously take care 
that they do not allow this dishonor to be done to Christ, 
that he should be called a curse or a malediction. In this 
way they make this

369 





They have therefore said, no less maliciously (sceleste) 
than ungodly, that this passage of Scripture argues 
against itself in Paul, which it does not do in its original 
place. 

This is what they try to prove: The saying of Moses 
(they say), which Paul cites here, does not speak of 
Christ. Furthermore, Moses does not add the general 
word "everyone" that Paul has. On the other hand, Paul 
omits the word "of God" which is in Moses. Finally, it is 
quite obvious that Moses is speaking of an evildoer or a 
murderer who deserved the cross with his evil deeds, as 
the Scriptures in the 5th book of Moses Cap. 21, 22 
clearly testifies. Therefore, they ask how this saying can 
be applied to Christ, that he is a cursed of God, hung on 
a wood, since he is not an evildoer or a murderer, but 
righteous and holy. 

320 This might move inexperienced people who think 
that the sophists not only spoke these things astutely, 
but also in a godly opinion, thereby defending the honor 
of Christ and admonishing Christians of godly minds not 
to think that Christ has become a curse in an ungodly 
way: (religious) minds that they should not think in an 
ungodly way that Christ has become a curse. Therefore, 
we must see what Paul's intention and opinion was. 

321 Paul has well fortified his words and spoken 
them clearly. But here again a difference must be made, 
as Paul's words sufficiently indicate. For he does not say 
that Christ became a curse for himself, but "for us". So 
the emphasis is on the word "for us". For Christ, as far 
as his person is concerned, is innocent, and therefore 
should not have been hanged on the wood. But because 
according to the law every murderer should be hanged, 
Christ also had to be hanged according to the law of 
Moses, because he had taken upon himself the person 
of a sinner and murderer, and not of one, but of all 
sinners and murderers. For we are sinners and 
murderers, and therefore guilty of death and eternal 
damnation. But Christ took all our sins upon himself and 
died for them on the cross. Therefore he had to be an 
evil 





and, as Isaiah, Cap. 53, 12, says, "will be counted 
among the evildoers. 

‘All the prophets saw this in their minds, that Christ 
would be the greatest of all evildoers, murderers, 
adulterers, thieves, robbers of God, blasphemers, 
whose like never existed in the world. Because he is the 
sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, he is now no 
longer an innocent person and without sins, no longer 
the Son of God, born of the virgin, but a sinner who has 
and bears the sin of Paul, who was a blasphemer, a 
persecutor and a violent man; of Peter, who denied 
Christ; of David, who was an adulterer and murderer, 
and made the Gentiles blaspheme the name of the Lord 
[2 Sam. 12:14] In short, He who took upon Himself all 
the sins of all men and bore them in His body, not 
because He Himself committed them, but because He 
took upon His body the sins we have committed, that He 
might be sufficient for them in His own blood. 

For this reason, the general law of Moses also 
includes him, although he is innocent in his own person, 
because it finds him among sinners and murderers, just 
as the authorities consider him guilty and punish him 
whom they seize among murderers, although he has 
never committed anything evil or worthy of death. Christ, 
however, was not only found among sinners, but he also 
voluntarily and according to the will of the Father wanted 
to be the companion? of sinners, and took upon himself 
the flesh and blood of those who are sinners and 
murderers and laden with all sins. Since the law found 
him among the murderers, it condemned him as a 
murderer and put him to death. 

324 This knowledge of Christ and this most sweet 
consolation, that Christ has become a curse for us, so 
that he may save us from the curse, is the most 
important thing. 


1) This and the two following paragraphs find (in the 
translation of Menius) used by Aurifaber for § 41 of the 
7th chapter of the Tischreden. In our edition of the Table 
Talks, this section is omitted. 

2) Latin: 806iu8. In the Wittenberg edition, due to a 
printing error, "Geisel" is written instead of: "Gesel". This 
error has passed into all other German editions. 


Aurifaber, however, expands this expression in the 


Tierehradan | a and wiritae: "dar Crindar GaiRal tind 


370 Dri. vai. II, 15-17. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2166-2171. 


The sophists deprive us of the salvation of the law by 
separating Christ from sins and sinners and presenting 
him to us only as an example to be followed. In this way 
they not only make Christ useless to us, but also present 
him as a judge and tyrant who is angry about sins and 
condemns sinners. We, however, must include 


(involvere) Christ under the curse and recognize that 
just as he is wrapped (involutum) in our flesh and blood, 
so also our sins, our curse, our death and all our evil are 
on him. 

325. But someone wants to say: It is very unrighteous 
and disgraceful to call the Son of God a sinner and a 
curse. | answer: If you deny that he is a sinner and a 
curse, deny also that he suffered, was crucified and 
died. It is no less unreasonable to say that the Son of 
God (as our faith confesses and prays) was crucified, 
endured the penalties of sin and death, than to call him 
a sinner or a cursed man. But if it is not unreasonable to 
confess and believe that Christ was crucified among 
murderers, neither can it be unreasonable to say that he 
was a cursed man and a sinner above all sinners. 

Surely these are not empty words in Paul: "Christ 
became a curse for us" [Gal. 3:13]. "God made Christ, 
who knew of no sin, to be sin for us, that we might 
become in Him the righteousness that is before God." 2 
Cor. 5, 21. 

In the same way, John the Baptist calls him "the 
Lamb of God who bears the sins of the world. True, he 
is innocent because he is the unblemished and 


blameless (incontaminatus) Lamb of God, but because 
he bears the sins of the world, his innocence is burdened 
with the sins and guilt of the whole world. All the sins that 
I, you, and all of us have done and will do in the future 
are Christ's own sins, just as if he had done them 
himself. In short, our sin must become Christ's own sin, 
or we must be lost for eternity. 

This right knowledge of Christ, which Paul and the 
prophets taught very clearly, has been obscured by the 
godless sophists. 





371 


Isaiah in the 53rd chapter speaks of Christ. He says 
[v. 6.]:. "GOD cast on him all our sin." We must not empty 
these words, but let them remain in their proper 
meaning. For GOD is not joking with the words of the 
prophet, but is speaking seriously and out of great love, 
namely, that this Lamb of GOD, Christ, should bear the 
sin of us all. But what does bear mean? The sophists 
answer: to be punished. Very well. But why is Christ 
punished? Is it not because he has sin and bears it? But 
that Christ has sin, the Holy Spirit also testifies in the 
40th Psalm, v. 13: "My sins have taken hold of me, that 
| cannot see; they are more than hairs of my head." And 
Ps. 41:5: "I said, Lord, be merciful unto me, heal my soul: 
for against thee have | sinned." And Ps. 69, 6. "God, thou 
knowest my foolishness, and my debts are not hid from 
thee." In these Psalms the Holy Spirit speaks in the 
person of Christ and testifies in revealed words that He 
has sins. But these testimonies of the Psalms are not 
words of the innocent, but of the suffering Christ, who 
took it upon himself to stand in the person of all sinners, 
and therefore he became guilty of the sins of the whole 
world. 

Therefore, Christ was not only crucified and died, but 
through the love of God, sin was also laid on Him. But 
after sin was laid upon him, the law came and said, 
"Every sinner must die. Therefore, if you, Christ, want to 
be a guarantor, to be guilty and to bear the punishment 
for sinners, you must also bear the sin and the curse. 
Paul therefore quite rightly cites the general law from 
Moses of Christ [Deut. 21, 23]: "Everyone who hangs on 
the wood is cursed by God"; Christ hung on the wood, 
therefore Christ is cursed by God. 

331 And this is the highest comfort of the godly, that 
Christ should put on mine, thine, and all the world's sin, 
and wrap himself in it, and that we should see that he 
bears all our sins, seeing that, when he is thus regarded, 
he easily removes the sophists' rapturous opinions of 
justification by works. For they dream 


372 Li. ri, n-20 


. Explanation of Galatians 3, 13, W. vin, 2171-2174. 


373 





A faith formed by love and claiming that through it sins 
are taken away and men are justified, which is nothing 
other than pulling Christ completely out of sins and 
winding him up and making him innocent, while we 
ourselves are weighed down and overwhelmed with our 
own sins and do not want to see them in Christ but in 
ourselves; this is in truth taking Christ away and making 
him useless. 

For if it is true that we take away sins by works of the 
law and by love, Christ does not take them away. But if 
he is the Lamb of God, predestined from eternity to take 
away the sins of the world, and then voluntarily wrapped 
himself in our sins in such a way that he became a curse 
for us, then it necessarily follows that we cannot become 
righteous and take away sins through love. For God did 
not put our sins on us, but on His Son Christ, so that we, 
having the punishment on Him, would have peace, and 
we would be healed by His wounds [Is. 53, 5]. Therefore 
they cannot be taken away by us, and all Scripture 
testifies to this, and we also confess and pray it in the 
Christian faith when we say: | believe in Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God, who suffered, was crucified and died for us. 

333. From this it is evident that the teaching of the 
Gospel, the most lovely teaching of all, and which is so 
exceedingly full of the richest consolation, does not 
preach of our works or of the works of the law, but of the 
incomprehensible and inexpressible mercy and love of 
God toward us unworthy and lost people, namely, that 
the merciful Father, seeing that we were oppressed by 
the curse of the law and held so low that even with our 
powers we could never have delivered ourselves from it, 
sent his only begotten Son into the world, and laid on him 
all the sins of all men, saying: You shall be Peter who 
denied; Paul who persecuted, blasohemed and did 
violence; David who broke marriage; the sinner who ate 
the apple in paradise; the thief on the cross: in short, you 
shall be the person who did all the sins of all men. 





so remember to pay and provide enough for them. 

334 Then cometh the law, saying, | find him to be a 
sinner, and such a one as hath taken upon him the sins 
of all men, and moreover | see no sin but of him alone; 
therefore let him die upon the cross: and so it assaileth 
him, and putteth him to death. 

Since this has happened, the whole world has been 
cleansed of all sins and atoned for, and thus also freed 
from death and all evil. Now that sin and death have 
been taken away by this one man, God could see 
nothing else in the whole world, especially if it believed, 
but pure purity and righteousness, and even though 
some remnants of sin remained, God would not see 
them before that sun, 1) Christ. 

336 Thus we must magnify the article of Christian 
righteousness against the righteousness of law and 
works, though there is no language or eloquence that 
can properly comprehend it, much less explain its 
greatness. 

Therefore, the reason Paul gives here is exceedingly 
powerful, and the highest of all against all righteousness 
of the law. For it contains this insurmountable and 
irrefutable contradiction: If the sins of the whole world 
are on this One Man Jesus Christ, then they are not out 
of the world; but if they are not on Him, then they are still 
in the world. Likewise, if Christ Himself has become 
guilty of all the sins we have all committed, then we are 
absolved of all sins, but not by us, by our works or merits, 
but by Him. But if he is innocent and does not bear our 
sins, we bear them and will die in them and be 
condemned. But thanks be to God, who has given us the 
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. 

But now let us see how in this person two completely 
opposite things come together. It is not only my sins, 
yours and the past, present and future sins of the whole 
world that attack him and seek to condemn him, as they 
do.

375 





But because in this very person, who is the highest, 
greatest and only sinner, there is also eternal and 
unconquerable righteousness, these two fight with each 
other, the highest, greatest, only sin and the highest, 
greatest and only righteousness. Here, one of the two 
must necessarily give way and be overcome, since they 
run against each other with the highest impetuosity and 
collide. 

So the sin of the whole world throws itself with the 
highest impetuosity and rage on justice. What happens? 
Justice is eternal, immortal and invincible. Sin is also an 
exceedingly powerful and cruel tyrant who rules and 
reigns over the whole earth and makes all men prisoners 
and slaves. In short, sin is a very great and mighty god, 
who rules over the whole human race, all the learned, the 
holy, the mighty, the wise and the unwise. Mighty, wise, 
and unlearned 2c. cast out (exhaurit). This one, | say, 
runs against Christ and wants to devour him like all 
others. But he does not see that he is a person of 
unconquerable and eternal righteousness. Therefore, sin 
must of necessity be overcome and killed in this duel, 
and righteousness must be victorious and live. Thus, in 
Christ, all sin is conquered, killed and buried, and 
righteousness remains victor and ruler forever. 

Thus death, which is the almighty ruler of the whole 
world, which kills kings, princes, and all men, fights 
against life with all its might, in order to defeat and devour 
it; and of course, that which it strives for, it also 
accomplishes. But because life is immortal, it, having 
been defeated, emerges victorious, defeats and kills 
death. The church sings beautifully about this wonderful 
duel: 

Death and life have quarreled at the same time in 
Christ. Death overcame life. But life retained 
victory at hand, so that now death lies slain, life 
reigns eternally in God. 1)

Therefore, through Christ death has been overcome 
and taken away in the whole world, so that now there is 
only a painted death, which, having lost its sting, cannot 
harm those who believe in Christ, since he has become 
the death of death, as Hosea sings: "Death, | will be a 
poison to you. 

342. The curse, which is God's wrath on the whole 
world, has the same struggle against the blessing, that 
is, against the eternal grace and mercy of God in Christ. 
So the curse fights with the blessing, and wants to 
condemn it and make it completely null and void, but it 
cannot. For the blessing is divine and eternal, therefore 
the curse must give way to it. For if the blessing in Christ 
could be overcome, God Himself would be defeated. But 
this is impossible. Therefore Christ, the divine power, 
overcomes righteousness, blessing, grace and life, and 
destroys those monsters, sin, death and the curse, 
without weapons and battles, in his body and through 
himself, as Paul likes to speak, saying [Col. 2, 15.]: "He 
has stripped the principalities and the mighty, and made 
a triumph of them through himself", so that they can no 
longer harm the believers 2c. 

343 And this circumstance, that he does it "by 
himself," makes this duel exceedingly wonderful and 
glorious. For it shows that these great things (namely, 
that the curse, sin, and death are destroyed, and 
blessing, righteousness, and life take their place) must 
be accomplished in this one person of Christ, and that 
thus through him the whole creature is changed. 
Therefore, when you look at this person, you see that sin, 
death, the wrath of God, hell, the devil and all evil have 
been overcome and killed. 

344 Therefore, if Christ reigns in the hearts of 
believers by his grace, there is no sin, no death, no 
curse. But where Christ is not recognized, these remain. 
Therefore, all those who do not believe lack this benefit 
and victory. For, as John says [1 Ep. 5, 4], "our faith is 
the victory." This is the main article of the Christian 
doctrine, which the Sophists completely undercut.

let. Therefore he became in truth a curse according to 
the law, not for himself, but, as Paul says, "for us". For if 
he had not taken upon himself my sin, your sin, and the 
sin of all the world, the law would have had no right to 
him, since it only condemns sinners and keeps them 
under the curse. Therefore, he could not have become 
a cursed man, nor die, since the cause of the curse and 
death is the sin from which he was free. But because he 
had taken our sins upon himself, not forced, but 
voluntarily, he had to bear the punishment and wrath of 
God, not for his person, which was righteous and [for sin] 
invincible, therefore that person could not become guilty, 
but for our person. 

Thus, for our good, he changed with us and took our 
sinful person and gave us his innocent and victorious 
person. Clothed and clothed with this, we are freed from 
the curse of the law, because Christ himself willingly 
became a curse for us. 

352. He says: | am blessed for my person, both 
according to humanity and according to the Godhead, 
and have no need of any thing at all, but | will express 


myself (exinanibo) [Phil. 2, 7.]), will take your garment 
and your form (/arvam), that is, human nature, and will 
walk in it and suffer death to deliver you from death. And 
therefore, since he bore the sin of the whole world in our 
likeness, he was seized, suffered, was crucified, died, 
and became a curse for us. But because he was a divine 
and eternal person, it was impossible that death could 
have held him. Therefore, on the third day he rose again 
from death and now lives forever, and in him no sin, no 
death, and our likeness is found any more, but only 
righteousness, life and eternal blessing. 

We must look at this image and grasp it with firm faith. 
Whoever does this has this innocence and this victory of 
Christ, however great a sinner he may be. But this image 
cannot be grasped by love, which is in our will 


(voluntate dilectionis), but only by reason, which is 
enlightened by faith. 





379 


So we are justified by faith alone, because faith alone 
takes hold of this victory of Christ. Now if you believe 
this, you have it. If you believe that sin, death and the 
curse have been taken away, they have been taken 
away, because Christ has conquered and taken them 
away in himself and wants us to believe that, just as in 
his person there is no longer any form of the sinner, no 
longer any trace of death, so also in our person there is 
no longer anything of this, since he has accomplished 
everything for us. 2c. 

354 Therefore, if sin frightens you, if death terrifies 
you, think that it is a vain specter and deception of the 
devil, as it certainly is. For indeed there is no more sin, 
no more curse, no more death, no more devil, because 
Christ has overcome and done away with all these 
things. 

355 Therefore, the victory of Christ is quite certain, 
and there is no lack in this matter, since it is certainly 
true, but the lack is due to our unbelief. For it is difficult 
for reason to believe such priceless goods. Then there 
is also the devil and the spirits, who only deal with this 
one thing, that they darken and take away this teaching 
from us, the one with fine poisonous arrows, the other 
with their perverse and godless teaching. And mainly for 
the sake of this article, which we so diligently pursue, we 
endure the hatred and persecution of Satan and the 
world. For Satan feels how powerful this article is and 
how great benefits it creates. 

356. But that, since Christ now reigns, there is indeed 
no more sin, no more death, no more curse, we also 
confess daily in the Apostles' Creed, when we say: "I 
believe in a holy church," which is nothing at all different 
from saying: | believe that there is no sin, no death in the 
church, because those who believe in Christ are not 
sinners, not guilty of death, but absolutely holy and 
righteous, masters of sin and death, and people who live 
forever. But this only faith sees, because we say, "I 
believe a holy church." But if you consult your reason 
and your eyes, you will judge quite differently. For you 
see 


380 


Il, 27-29. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 13, W. VIII, 2186-2189. 


381 





many things about the godly that annoy you; you see 
how they sometimes fall, sin, are weak in faith, how they 
still have anger, envy and other evil inclinations about 
them. From this you want to conclude: So the church is 
not holy. But | deny the inference. If | look at my person 
or that of my neighbor, the same will never be holy. But 
if | look at Christ, who sanctifies and purifies the church, 
it is completely holy. For he has borne the sins of the 
whole world. 

For according to Paul's theology, there is no more sin 
in the world, no more death, no more curse, but out of 
Christ, who is the Lamb of God that took away the sins 
of the world, who became a curse that He might deliver 
us from the curse. 

According to worldly wisdom and reason, sin, death 
and curse are nowhere else than in the world, in the flesh 
or in sinners. For a sophistical theologian cannot speak 
of sin in any other way than a pagan philosopher, 
namely thus: The quality is attached to the essence or 
the object; just as therefore the color is attached to the 
wall, so sin is attached to the world, the flesh or the 
conscience. Therefore it must be eradicated by the 
opposite motus, namely by love. 

True theology teaches that there is no longer any sin 
in the world, because Christ, on whom the Father cast 
the sins of the whole world (Is 53:6), overcame them in 
his body, eradicated them and killed them. He died once 
to sin, but having been raised from the dead, he dies no 
more [Rom. 6:9]. Therefore, wherever there is faith in 
Christ, sin has in truth been taken away, died and been 
buried. But where there is no faith in Christ, sin remains. 
Although there are still remnants of sin in the saints, 
because they do not believe perfectly, 2c. they are dead, 
because they are not imputed for the sake of faith in 
Christ. 

') 360. So this is the highest and ge- 


1) This and the following paragraphs are written by Aurifaber (in an 
extremely free revision of the Ueber 





This is the most important reason for Paul's insistence 
against righteousness by works: Not the law, not the 
works redeem from the eternal curse, but Christ. 
Therefore, for God's sake, dear Christian reader, | ask 
you to distinguish Christ from the law, and to pay careful 
attention to what and how Paul speaks. He says: 
Necessarily all are under the curse who do not do the 
law; but no one does it, so the first sentence is true, that 
all men are under the curse. Then he adds the second 
sentence: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law 
when he became a curse for us, so the law and works 
do not redeem us from the curse, but rather subject us 
to the curse, so love, of which the Sophists say that it 
gives faith its proper form (informare), not only does not 
redeem us from the curse, but only pushes us and brings 
us more into it. 

As Christ is something different from the law and the 
works of the law, so also the redemption of Christ is 
something far different from my merit from the works of 
the law, because Christ himself had to redeem us from 
the curse of the law. Therefore, all remain under the 
curse who do not take hold of Christ in faith. For even 
the sophists are not so foolish as to say that Christ is our 
work or love. For Christ is something far different than a 
work that we do. No pope, however great he may be, will 
dare to say that the alms he gives to a poor man, the 
obedience a monk pays, is Christ. For Christ is God and 
man, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin 
Mary 2c. But of this Paul says that he became a curse 
for us, that he might redeem us from the curse of the law. 
So the law, works, love, vows 2c. do not redeem us, but 
push us deeper into it and only weigh us down more with 
the curse. Thus, the more we have been occupied with 
works, the less we are able to recognize and grasp 
Christ. 

362. But Christ is seized, not by setting Menius) is used 
for the last part of § 40 of the 7th chapter of the Table Talks. In our 
edition of the Table Talks, this section is omitted.

the law, not by works, but by reason or intellect 
enlightened by faith, and this grasping of Christ by faith 
is actually the contemplative life (of which the sophists 
prate much, but they know not what they speak), and this 


contemplation (speculatio) by which Christ is grasped, 
is not the foolish conceit of the sophists and the monks 
who ‘deal with wonderful things that are too high for 
them, but is the theological, believing and divine 
contemplation of the serpent hung on the pole, that is, of 
Christ hanging on the cross for my, your and the whole 
world's sins. It is therefore evident that faith alone 
justifies. 

363 But after we have been justified by faith, we go 
out into the active (activam) life. In this way, the Sophists 
could have properly distinguished between the 
contemplative and the active life, if they had called the 
former the gospel and the latter the law, that is, if they 
had taught that the contemplative life must be enclosed 
in God's word and guided by it, and that nothing must be 
considered in it but the word of the gospel, but that the 
active life must flow from the law, which the Christian 
does not grasp, but practices in works of love toward his 
neighbor. 

Here, then, is a clear text that all men, even the 
apostles and prophets and patriarchs, would have 
remained under the curse if Christ had not opposed sin, 
death, the curse of the law, the wrath and judgment of 
God, and overcome them in his body (for these cruel 
monsters could not be overcome by any human power). 
Now Christ is not the law, he is not a work of the law, he 
is not a deed produced by human will (actus élicitus), 
but he is a person who is true God and true man, who 
took sin, the condemnation of the law and death upon 
himself, not for himself, but "for us". Therefore, the whole 
emphasis lies on the word: "for us". 

Therefore, we do not have to think of Christ as an 
innocent and private person. 








383 


(as the Sophists and almost all the Fathers, Jerome and 
others have done), which is holy and righteous only in 
itself. 1) It is true that Christ is an entirely pure person, 
but one must not stop there. For you do not yet have 
Christ, even if you know that he is God and man, but only 
then do you have him in truth, when you believe that this 
completely pure and innocent person is given to you by 
the Father, so that he might be your high priest and 
savior, yes, your servant, who, having stripped himself of 
his innocence and holiness and taken your sinful person, 
should bear your sin, death and curse and become a 
sacrifice and curse for you, thus freeing you from the 
curse of the law. 

So you see how Paul, with a completely apostolic 
spirit, has dealt with this extremely weighty evidence of 
the blessing and the curse, in that he not only subjects 
Christ Himself to the curse, but also says that He has 
become a curse. Thus, in the second letter to the 
Corinthians, Cap. 5, 21, he calls him sin, since he says: 
"God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us" 2c. 
Although these sayings could properly be interpreted 
thus: Christ became a curse, that is, a sacrifice for the 
curse; he was made sin, that is, a sacrifice for sin 2c., yet 
| like it better if the proper meaning of the words is 
preserved for the sake of greater emphasis. For when a 
sinner in truth comes to self-knowledge, he feels that he 
is a sinner not only in so far as sin is perceptible in him 


outwardly (concretive) or clings to him (adjective), but 
also in so far as it is present in him in himself 


(abstractive) and existing for himself (Substantive), that 
is, it seems to him that he is not only burdened with 
misfortune, but that he is misfortune itself, not only a 
sinner and a cursed man, but sin and the curse itself, just 
as in Latin, when we want to express in a particularly 
strong way that someone is a wicked man 


1) What now follows in this paragraph is used by Aurifaber for the 
beginning of § 40 of the 7th chapter of the Table Talks. In our edition 
of the Table Talks, this section is omitted. 


384 Nri. (lai. Il, 31-34. Explanation of Galatians 3, 13, W. VIII, 2192-2196. 


(scelestum), say: He is wickedness (scelus) itself. For it 
is an exceedingly great thing to bear sin, the wrath of 
God, the curse and death. Therefore, the man who 
sincerely feels these things, as Christ truly felt them for 
the whole human race, becomes wholly sin, death, curse 
2c. 

So Paul acts this passage in a quite apostolic spirit, 
because no sophist, no teacher of the law, no Jew, no 
fanatic, nor anyone else speaks like this. For who could 
have dared to quote this passage from Moses [Deut. 21, 
23. Gal. 3, 13.]: "Cursed is everyone who hangs on 
wood" 2c. and to interpret it to Christ? In the same way 
as Paul drew this saying: "Cursed is everyone" 2c. to 
Christ, so we can summarize not only the whole 27th 
chapter of the 5th book of Moses, but also all the curses 
of the Mosaic law and point them to Christ. For as Christ 
is innocent in this general law for his person, so also in 
all others; and as he is guilty in this general law, having 
become a curse for us, and having been hanged on the 
cross as a wicked, blasphemous man, a murderer of 
fathers, a traitor 2c., so also he is guilty in all other laws. 
For all the curses of the law were brought together and 
laid upon him, and therefore he bore them and took them 
upon his body for us. Therefore he was not only a cursed 
man, but also became a curse for us. 

368 This means to interpret the Scriptures in a truly 
apostolic way. For a man without the Holy Spirit cannot 
speak in this way, namely, that he should sum up the 
whole law in one word (namely, "Christ became a curse 
for us") and lay it all at once on Christ, and on the other 
hand sum up all the promises of Scripture and say that 
they are all fulfilled at once in Christ. Therefore, this 
reason for proof is an apostolic and exceedingly firm one, 
which is not taken from one passage of the law, but from 
all the laws altogether, and Paul also firmly insists on it. 

From this you can see with what diligence Paul had 
read the Scriptures and how much he had read them. 





385 


from which he carefully considered every single word of 
this passage: "Through your seed all nations on earth 
shall be blessed" [Gen. 22:18]. First he makes the 
conclusion from the word "bless": The blessing shall 
come upon all nations, therefore all nations are under the 
curse, also the Jews who have the law, and brings a 
testimony of Scripture by which he proves that the Jews 
are under the curse who are under the law [Deut. 27, 26; 
Gal. 3, 10]: "Cursed be every one that continueth not in 
all these things. 

Then he emphasizes the word "all Gentiles," from 
which he concludes that the blessing belongs not only to 
the Jews, but also to all peoples of the whole earth. But 
since it also belongs to all Gentiles, it is 1) impossible for 
it to be obtained through the law of Moses, since no other 
people had this law but the Jews. And even though they 
had the law, they received so little blessing from it that 
the more they strove to do the same, the more they were 
subjected to the curse of the law. Therefore, it must be 
another righteousness, far surpassing the righteousness 
of the law, by which the blessing is obtained, not only for 
the Jews, but also for all peoples in the whole world. 

Finally he explains the word "in your seed” in this way, 
that a man should be born from the seed of Abraham, 
namely Christ, through whom the blessing should come 
over all Gentiles. Now, since Christ was to bless all the 
Gentiles whom he found cursed, he had to take the curse 
away from them. But he could not remove it by the law, 
because the curse is only increased by it. So what did he 
do? He joined the cursed, took on their flesh and blood, 
and thus placed himself as a mediator between God and 
man and said: "Although | am flesh and blood, and live 
among the cursed, | am the blessed one, through whom 
all men shall be blessed. And so he united in one 
personGod and mankind, joined us cursed ones and 
became a curse for us, and brought his blessing into our 
sin, death, and death.

and curse hidden, who condemned and killed him. But 
because he was the Son of God, he could not be held by 
those; he defeated them and made a triumph of them; 
and all that adhered to the flesh, which he had assumed 
for our sake, he took with him. Therefore, all who cling to 
this flesh are blessed, delivered from the curse, that is, 
from sin and death. 

‘Those who do not understand this good deed of 
Christ, of which the gospel actually preaches, nor know 
any other righteousness than that of the law, are angry 
when they hear that the works of the law are not 
necessary for salvation, but that salvation is granted to 
men by only hearing and believing that the Son of God 
has taken our flesh and joined the cursed, in order to 
bless all nations. For they understand nothing of all this, 
or at least understand it only carnally. For they are taken 
in by other thoughts and fanciful imaginings. Therefore 
they are only dark speeches. Yes, it is impossible for us, 
who have the firstfruits of the spirit, to fully understand 
and believe this, because it most strongly contradicts 
human reason. 

In short, all evil would have fallen upon us, as it will 
fall upon the wicked for eternity. But Christ became guilty 
for us of all laws, curses, sins and all our misfortunes, 
came as our mediator, took care of us who are miserable 
and lost sinners, took upon himself and carried all our 
misfortunes, which would have oppressed and plagued 
us for eternity. The same fell upon him once and for a 
little while, and came upon his head like a flood, as the 
prophet laments in the 88th Psalm, v. 8. and 17. in the 
person of Christ 2), saying, "Thy wrath oppresseth me, 
and presseth me with all thy floods"; likewise, "Thy wrath 
passeth over me, thy terror oppresseth me." In this way, 
freed from these eternal terrors and plagues, we become 
eternal through Christ.

and enjoy unspeakable peace and bliss, if only we 
believe this. 
These are the adorable mysteries of the Scriptures 


and the true secret doctrine (cabala), which Moses also 
indicated somewhat obscurely in some places, which 
the prophets and apostles understood and handed down 
from hand to hand to their descendants. The saints of 
the Old Testament rejoiced more over it when it was still 
future than we rejoice over it now that it has appeared. 

3We recognize that the knowledge of Christ and the 
righteousness of faith is a tremendous treasure, but we 
do not derive from it such complete joy of the Spirit as 
the prophets and apostles had. 

For this reason they, and especially Paul, have so 
abundantly acted and so often inculcated the article of 
justification. For this is the true office of the apostles, that 
they praise Christ's glory and good deeds, and by this 
means they instruct and comfort the afflicted 
consciences. 4) 


V. 14: That the blessing of Abraham might come 
among the Gentiles in Christ Jesus. 


377 Paul always has this passage in mind: "Through 
your seed" 2c., because the blessing promised to 
Abraham could not come among the Gentiles except 
through Abraham's seed, Christ, and in this way: He had 
to become a curse, so that the promise made to 
Abraham, "Through thy seed shall all the Gentiles be 
blessed," would be so fulfilled. 

378 Therefore, what is promised here could not 
happen in any other way than that Jesus Christ would 
become a curse and unite with the cursed Gentiles and 
thus remove the curse from them and bring them 
righteousness and life through His blessing. 

But you must remember, as | also reminded you 
above, that the word "blessing" is not a vain word, as the 
Jews dream, who interpret the word "blessing" as a 
verbal or written greeting, 


3) From here to the end of the following paragraph is missing in

but Paul deals here with sin and righteousness, with 
death and life before God. So he speaks of inestimable 
and incomprehensible things when he says: "That the 
blessing of Abraham might come among the Gentiles in 
Christ Jesus" 2c. 

380. Moreover, you see what merits, by which we 


merit according to equity or according to dignity (merita 
congrui et condigni), we bring forth, and by what 


consecration we obtain this blessing. This is the 
preparation, that is, the merit according to equity and 
dignity, these are the works by which this righteousness 
is brought about, that Christ Jesus has become a curse 
for us. For we do not know God and are His enemies, 
we are dead in sins and cursed, so our merit is nothing 
at all. For what should a cursed sinner deserve, who 
does not know GOD, who is dead in sins, guilty of GOD's 
wrath and judgment? If the pope put someone under the 
ban, whatever he did was cursed. How much more does 
he who is cursed in the sight of God, as we all are before 
he knows Christ, do nothing but cursed things 


(maledicta). 

Therefore the only way to escape this curse is to 
believe and say with certain confidence: You, Christ, are 
my sin and my curse, or rather: | am your sin, your curse, 
your death, your wrath, your hell; whereas you are my 
righteousness, my blessing, my life, my grace from God, 
my heaven. For the text clearly says, "Christ became a 
curse for us." Therefore we are the cause that he 
became a curse, yes, we are his curse. 

382 Although this mighty and exceedingly comforting 
saying is not sufficient for the blind and hardened Jews, 
it is sufficient for us who have been baptized and have 
accepted this teaching, and it proves most strongly that 
we have been blessed, that is, justified and made alive, 
through the curse, sin and death of Christ. 

383. as long as sin, death, and the curse remain in us, 
sin terrifies, death kills, and the curse condemns us; but 
as soon as they are put on Christ, they will 





these our ills his own, and the good he has becomes 
ours. 

Therefore, let us learn to cast away from us, in every 
trial, sin, death, the curse, and all the evil that oppresses 
us, upon Christ, and to receive righteousness, life, and 
blessing from him. For He indeed bears all our 
misfortunes, since God the Father, as Isaiah says [Cap. 
53:6], cast all our sins upon Him. And he gladly took it 
upon himself, for he was not guilty, but that in it he might 
do the will of the Father, by which we are sanctified for 
eternity. 

This is the inexpressible and infinite mercy of God, 
which Paul would like to pour out with overflowing and 
exceedingly rich abundance of words. But this deep 
abyss and the burning zeal of divine love towards us 
cannot be grasped by the human heart, much less 
expressed in words. Yes, even the greatness of divine 
mercy causes that one not only hardly believes, but also 
behaves incredulously towards it. For | not only hear that 
the Almighty God, the Creator of all things, is good and 
merciful, but that this supreme Majesty has been so 
concerned for me, a lost sinner, who was a child of wrath 
and eternal death, that He did not spare His own Son, 
but gave him up to the most shameful death, that he, 
hanging on the cross between murderers, became sin 
and curse for me, a sinful and cursed man, so that | 
might become a blessed one, that is, a righteous one, a 
child and heir of God. Who can sufficiently praise this 
goodness of God? Even all the angels are unable to do 
so. 

Therefore, the teaching of the Gospel speaks of far 
different things than any worldly, philosophical or Mosaic 
book, namely of ineffable and completely divine gifts, 
which go beyond all understanding of men and angels, 
yes, are higher than everything. 


And so we received the promised spirit through 
faith. 


387. "The promise of the spirit" (promissionem 
Spiritus) is a Hebrew way 


390 [ri. Oai. Il, 39-41. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 220S-2212. 


391 





that is, "the promised spirit". But "the spirit" is the 
freedom from the law, from sin, from death, curse, hell, 
wrath and judgment of God 2c. There is no merit, which 
we obtained according to equity or by our worthiness 
(nostrum meritum congrui aut condigni), but the 
promise is given by grace and the gift is imparted to us 
through the seed of Abraham, that we are free from all 
evil and obtain all good. And this freedom and gift of the 
Holy Spirit we receive through no other merit than 
through faith. For this alone takes hold of the promise, 
as Paul here clearly says: "That we might receive the 
promised Spirit" not by works, but "through faith." 

388 And this is an exceedingly sweet and truly 
apostolic doctrine, which proclaims that what "many 
prophets and kings desired to see and hear" 2c. was 
fulfilled and now given to us. [Luc. 10, 24.], and such 
passages as this are gathered from various sayings of 
the prophets, who foresaw long before in the spirit that 
all things should be changed, restored, and ruled by this 
man, Christ. 

Therefore, the Jews, who had the Law of God, still 
expected Christ. No prophet or ruler of God's people 
gave a new law, but Elijah, Samuel, David and all the 
others remained under the law of Moses, did not 
establish a new Decalogue, not a new kingdom and 
priesthood, because this new change of kingdom, 
priesthood, law and worship was reserved for this One, 
of whom Moses had proclaimed long before [Deut. 18, 
15]: "The Lord your God will raise up a prophet like me 
for you, from you and from your brothers, and you shall 
obey him", as if he wanted to say, to him alone and to no 
one else. 

This was well understood by the fathers, because no 
one could teach anything greater and more exalted than 
Moses himself, who had given the highest laws of the 
highest and greatest things, as the holy ten 
commandments are, especially the first commandment 
[2 Mos. 20, 2. f.]: "| am the LORD your GOD, you shall 
have no other gods." [Deut. 6, 5.]: "You 


You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart" 2c. 

The law of love towards God also includes the angels, 
therefore it is the source of all divine wisdom 2c. And yet 
another teacher had to come, namely Christ, who was to 
bring and teach something far greater and better than 
these supreme laws, namely grace and forgiveness of 
sins. 

392 So this text is an extremely powerful one, 
because Paul pours out the whole thing at once with this 
very short word: "So that we might receive the promised 
Spirit through faith. Therefore, because he could not go 
any further, for he was not able to say anything greater 
or more sublime, he broke off here and stopped there. 1) 


V. 15 Dear brothers, I will speak in a human way. 
Do not despise a man's testament when it is 
confirmed, and do nothing to it. 


After the most important and powerful reason, Paul 
adds another one, taken from the likeness of a human 
testament, which seems to be only oratorical and too 
weak for an apostle to use to confirm this great thing. 

For in great difficult matters we must rather confirm 
human things by divine, not divine by human. Hence also 
Cicero says about Homer: He transfers human things to 
the gods; | would rather he transferred divine things to 
us. And it is certainly true that these grounds are the 
weakest of all when we infer from human things to divine, 
as Scotus is wont to do. Man, he says, can love God 
above all things; because he loves himself above all 
things, he can rather love God in this way, because the 
greater a good is, the more lovable it is; and from this he 
concludes that a man of purely natural powers can fulfill 
this highest commandment without difficulty: "Thou shalt 
love God thy Lord with all thy heart. 


1) Menius has spun out the last three paragraphs in his translation 
to such an extent that they take up two and a half columns.

zem Herzen" 2c. For, he says, man can love even an 
exceedingly small good above all things, yes, even his 
life, which of all things is dearest to him, he offers for 
sale for a miserable and small 1) sum of money, so he 
can do this much more for God's sake. 

You have often heard from me that the world order 
and the household are divine orders, because God has 
ordered and confirmed them like the sun, the moon and 
other creatures. Therefore, a reason for proof, which is 
taken from the order or creatures of God, is powerful, if 
it is only used properly. Thus the prophets very often 
used parables of the creatures, as they called Christ the 
sun, the church the moon, the teachers stars. Similarly, 
there are innumerable other parables in the prophets of 
trees, thorns, flowers and fruits of the earth. The New 
Testament is also full of such. And therefore, where 
there is a divine order in the creature, a reason of proof 
can very well be taken from it and transferred to divine 
things. 

396. so Christ Matth. 7, 11. leads his proof, by 
concluding from human things to divine, when he says: 
"If you, who are bad, can still give good gifts to your 
children, how much more will your Father in heaven give 
good things to those who ask him!Likewise Paul says 
that one must be obedient to men, so much more to God 
[Eph. 6, 1. 5. ff.], and Jeremiah says in the 35th chapter, 
v. 16: "The Rechabites obeyed their father, how much 
more should you obey me! But this is ordained of GOD, 
that the fathers should give [good gifts] to the children, 
that the children should be obedient to the parents. 
Therefore, such proofs are good if they are taken from 
the divine order. But if they are taken from the human 


depraved inclinations (affectibus), they are bad and of 
no use at all. Such is the proof of Scotus: | love a lesser 


good, consequently | love a greater one more. There | 
deny the conclusion’, because my loving is not a divine 


1) Instead of rasUleara in the Erlanger is to be read with the 
Wittenberg and Jena rnoalcnrn. 





order, but a devilish perversity. It should be that since | 
love myself or another creature, | should love God my 
Creator more; but it does not happen, because the love 
with which | love myself is sinful and against God. 

| say this so that no one will make the sophistical 
objection that the proof from human things to divine 
ones is not valid. Now | do not dispute whether this is a 
rhetorical or a dialectical reason for proof, but only say 
this, that it is a sufficiently solid reason for proof when 
we deduce from human things to divine ones, provided 
that we base these deductions only on what God has 
ordered, as in the present trade. 

For the civil law, which is a divine order, contains [this 


provision’ that one may not shake (infirmari) a man's 
will. As long as the testator is still alive, it is not yet 
confirmed; but if he has died, one may not change it. 


This is not said of what is often done (de facto), but of 


what should be done according to law (de jure), that is, 
what should be done, and what would happen if one 
behaved in the right way, because it is right that a will 
should not be changed; indeed, the laws command that 
the last will should be kept in the most respectful way. 
This is one of the things that are kept inviolable among 
men (unum inter sacra humana). 

399 Thus Paul gives his proof of the custom that is 
kept in a human testament. How is it that men are 
obeyed, but God is not obeyed? Secular and civil 
ordinances of wills and other things are scrupulously 
kept. Nothing is changed, nothing is added, nothing is 
taken away. But the testament of God, that is, the divine 
promise of spiritual blessings, that is, of heavenly and 
eternal things, which the whole world should not only 
receive with the greatest gratitude and open arms, but 
also worship, must suffer to be changed and added to. 


394 Oai. II, 43-45. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2218-2220. 395 





This serves to persuade them, since in this way he siel, as today all papists and works saints are 
takes his proof from the examples and laws of men. transgressors and destroyers, not of ahuman testament, 
Therefore he says, "I will speak after the manner of men,"| for they are prevented from doing so by law, but of the 
that is, | will give you a human likeness, as if to say: In| testament of God, whom they do not fear, even though 
wills and other human things, what the law commands is} he is a consuming fire. For this is the way of all 
carried out and kept. For when a man makes a will and hypocrites, that they keep human things conscientiously, 
bequeaths his goods to his heirs and dies, the will is} but certainly despise and violate what is of God. But 
confirmed and made immutable by the death of the] these sacrilegious despisers and destroyers of God's 
testator, so that nothing can be added to it or taken away] testament will have to suffer a terrible judgment in their 
from it, according to all laws. Therefore, the last will and) time. This is therefore a sufficiently solid reason for 


testament is considered by legal scholars as much as 
law, and sensible people keep it conscientiously. If, then, 
I say, a man's will is kept with such fidelity that nothing is| 
added to it or taken away from it, truly with much greate 
fidelity should the will of God be kept, which he promised} 
and gave to Abraham and his seed. For in Christ it was 
confirmed when he died, and after his death the letter of 
the testament was opened, that is, the blessing promised 
to Abraham was preached among all the nations| 
scattered throughout the world. This was the last will o 
the testator, God, which was confirmed by the death of 
Christ. 

(401) Therefore no one may change it or add to it, as 
the teachers of the law and of human statutes do. Fo 
they say, Unless you are circumcised, keep the law, d 
many works, and suffer, you cannot be saved. This is not 
the last will or testament of God. For he did not say to} 
Abraham, If thou do this or that, thou shalt obtain the 
blessing, or, The circumcised and those who keep the 
law shall obtain it, but, In thy seed, 2c. as if to say: Ou 
of pure mercy | promise you Christ, who shall come from 
your seed, who shall bring blessing to all the Gentiles} 
oppressed by sin and death, that is, who shall deliver all 
nations from the eternal curse, that is, from sin and 
death, who accept this promise in faith: "In your seed" 2c. 
402 Therefore, just as the false apostles once were 





proof, which is taken from divine order. 


V. 16. Now the promise is made to Abraham and 
his seed. He does not say: through the seed, as 
through many, but as through one, through your 
seed, which is Christ. 


Here Paul calls the promises of God, which were 
promised to Abraham by Christ as the future giver of 
salvation over all nations, with a new name "testament", 
and the promise is also nothing other than a testament, 
which has not yet been opened, but is still sealed. A will, 
however, is not a law, but a gift. For the heirs do not 
expect laws, compulsion or any kind of burden from the 
will, but the inheritance. 

404 First, then, he explains the words, then he 
applies the simile and emphasizes the word "seed". 
Abraham, he says, was not given laws, but a testament 
was made for him and given to him, that is, the promises 
of spiritual blessings were made to him; thus something 
was promised and given to him. Therefore, if the 
testament of a man is kept, why not rather of God, whose 


mere likeness (allegoria) and image (larva) is a human 
testament? Likewise, if we keep the signs, why not 
rather the things signified by them? 

405 Now the promises were not made to Abraham 
through all the Jews or through many seeds, but through 
One, who is Christ. The Jews do not accept this 
interpretation of Paul. Because they invent here a 


confusion (enallagen) of the 


396 


ii, 4S-48. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 3, 16. 17. W. vm, 2220-2223. 


397 





Numerus and say that the singular is taken for the plural. 
But we accept the opinion of Paul, who does not press 
the word "seed" in vain, and interprets that this seed is 
Christ, and that in a truly apostolic spirit. The Jews may 
deny this, but we have many and very strong grounds of 
proof which are sufficient, namely, those which Paul has 
adduced above. These they cannot deny, and they 
[these reasons] also confirm this. That [be sufficient] of 
the similitude and figurative speech taken from a divine 
order, that is, from a man's testament. Now he interprets 
it and applies it. 


V. 17. But I say of this, that the testament, which 
was confirmed of God beforehand unto Christ, shall 
not be revoked, that the promise by the law should 
cease, which was given four hundred and thirty years 
after. 


Here the Jews could have objected: God was not 
content to give Abraham the promises, but after 430 
years He also gave the Law. So God distrusted His 
promises and did not believe that they could justify; 
therefore He added something better, namely the Law, 
so that, since it came as a better successor, they would 
not be idle, but, keeping the Law, would be justified by it. 
So the law, which followed the promise, took it away. The 
Jews seek many such excuses. 

407 Paul removes this objection in a beautiful and 
striking way. The law, he says, which was given more 
than 430 years later than the promise made to Abraham; 
"In your seed" 2c., could not cancel the promise. For this 
promise is the testament of God, which was confirmed by 
God Himself so many years before the law on Christ. But 
what God has once promised and confirmed, He does 
not revoke or limit, but it remains unchangeable (ratum) 
before Him for eternity. 

408 Why then is the law added? It was given to the} 
descendants of Abraham so many centuries later, but not 
so that they might receive blessings through it. 








Since the office of the law is to cast under the curse, not 
that it should bless, but that there should be a peculiar 
people on earth, having the word and testimony of Christ, 
out of whom also Christ should be born according to the 
flesh, and that the people, preserved and determined 
under the law, should groan for deliverance through 
Christ, the promised seed of Abraham, who alone should 
and could bless, that is, make all nations free from sin 
and death. Then also the ceremonies, which were 
commanded in the law, were a model for Christ 


(adumbrabant). Therefore, the promise was not taken 
away by the law or by the ceremonies, but rather 
confirmed by them, as it were, as a seal, until the letter 
of the testament (the promise) was opened and made 
known to all the Gentiles through the preaching of the 
gospel. 

But let us let the law and the promise fight with each 
other, and let us see which of the two is stronger, namely, 
whether the promise takes away the law, or the law takes 
away the promise. If the law detracts from the promise, 
then it follows that with our works we make God a liar and 
nullify His promise, because if the law makes righteous, 
frees from sin and death, and consequently our works 
and human powers fulfill the law, then the promise made 
to Abraham is also in vain and completely useless, and 
consequently God is a liar and speaks vain things. For 
what else does it mean if someone has promised 
something and does not want to keep his promise or 
cancel it, but that he is a liar and a useless talker? 

But it is impossible that the law should make God a 
liar, and that our works should nullify His promise. 
Rather, it must be unchanging and firm (for GOD does 
not promise in vain). Even though we could keep and 
fulfill the law, and even if we ourselves wanted to admit 
that all people were as holy as the angels (which is 
impossible), so that they would have no need of the 
promise at all, it is absolutely necessary to hold to the 
fact that it is quite certain and firm, for otherwise God 
would be unjustified. 


398 Ai-I. o-u. Il, 48-so. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2223-2227. 


399 





He was found negligent (vanus) or lying, because he 
either made the promise in vain or did not want to or 
could not keep his promise. Therefore, as the promise 
is before the law, so it is exceedingly more glorious. 

411. And God was quite right in giving the promise 
so long before the law, with the express intention that it 
could not be said that righteousness was given through 
the law and not through the promise. For if he had 
intended that we should be justified by the law, he would 
have given the law 430 years before the promise, or at 
least at the same time as the promise. But now he is 
completely silent about the law at first, and only after 430 
years he gives it. Meanwhile he talks about his promises 
during this whole time. So the blessing and the giving of 
righteousness before the law came through the promise. 
The promise therefore far surpasses the law, and so the 
law does not cancel the promise, but faith in the 
promise, through which the faithful were saved even 
before the revelation of Christ, which is now preached 
through the gospel among all the peoples of the earth, 
cancels the law so that it can no longer increase sin, 
frighten sinners and plunge them into despair who take 
hold of the promise in faith. 

412 There is a great emphasis or rather a mockery 
(ironia) in the fact that he expresses the number 430 
years so exactly, as if he wanted to say: If you can count, 
count on your fingers how much time there is between 
the promise and the law. Abraham certainly received the 
promise a long time before the law, because the law was 
given to the people of Israel 430 years later, and this 
reason, which was taken from a certain time, is very 
strong. 

413. But he does not speak here of the law in 
general, but only of the written law, as if he wanted to 
say: God could not look at the worship and works of the 
law and give righteousness to those who did them, 
because the law was not yet in existence, which 
commands worship, demands works and promises life 
to those who do them, 








who do it. "Whosoever man doeth them," saith he [Deut. 
18:5], "he shall live thereby." And no matter how much 
the law promises this, it still does not follow that we 
obtain the promises of it, because it clearly says, 
"Whichever man doeth the same." 2c. But it is well known 
that no one fulfills them. Furthermore, Paul says that the 
law cannot take away the promise. Therefore, the 
promise made to Abraham 430 years before the law 
remains unchanged. 

414 In order that this matter may be the better 
understood, | will illustrate it by a simile. If a rich man, not 
out of compulsion but out of good will, accepted a person 
unknown to him, to whom he owed nothing everywhere, 
in the place of a child and made him heir to all his goods, 
but then, after a few years, after this benefit had been 
granted, a law was laid down for him to do this or that, 
he could not say that he had earned the benefit by his 
works, since he had received it for free out of pure grace 
so many years before, having asked for nothing. So also 
God could not look at the works and merits that preceded 
righteousness, because the promise and the gift of the 
Holy Spirit was there 430 years before the law. Paul 
emphasizes this by mocking the Galatians (per 
ironiam). 

It is evident from this that Abraham did not attain 
righteousness before God through the Law, because the 
Law was not yet present. But if the law was not there, 
then neither were there works nor merit. What was 
there? Nothing but the mere promise of God. Abraham 
believed it, and this was counted to him as 
righteousness. In the same way that the father attained 
righteousness, his children also attain it. 

416 So also we say today: Our sins were expiated by 
the death of Christ fifteen hundred years ago, when there 
was no order, no laws prescribing how to do penance 
(canon poenitentiae), no merits according to equity 
and dignity. Therefore, we cannot eradicate them only 
now by our works and merits. 

417 Thus Paul gathers from all sides 


400 Lri. cat. Il, 50-52. Explanation of Galatians 3, 17. W. VIII, 2227-2231. 


401 





solid grounds of proof from parables, from certain times| 
and persons, which no reasonable man can dispute. Let 
us therefore fortify our consciences with such proofs, for] 
it is of great use in times of challenge to have them well 
thought out, for they lead us from law and works to 
promise and faith, from wrath to grace, from sins to} 
righteousness, from death to life. 

Therefore, as | often point out, 1) these two pieces, 
the law and the promise, must be most carefully 
distinguished, because in time, place, persons, and in 
short, in all circumstances, they are as far apart from each 
other as heaven and earth, as the beginning and end of 
the world. Although they are very close to each other, 
because they are united in one man or in one soul, they| 


must remain extremely far apart in heart (in affectu) and 
according to their office, namely, as the law should have} 
its rule over the flesh, so the promise, on the other hand, 
should rule in a loving way in the conscience. 

419. If in this way you assign to each his certain place, 
you will surely walk in the midst of the heaven of promise 
and on the earth of the law, in the spirit in the paradise of 
grace and peace, in the flesh on the earth of works and 
suffering. Then even the afflictions that the flesh must 
bear will not be heavy, because of the sweetness of the 
promise, which delights the heart in a wonderful way. Buf 
if you mix these two and bring the law into the conscience} 
and the promise of freedom into the flesh, then al 
confusion arises, as it was under the papacy, so that you 
do not know what is law, what is promise, what is sin, 
what is righteousness. 

Therefore, if you want to rightly divide the word of 
truth, you should distinguish the two as far as possible, 
the promise and the law, in the heart and in the whole life, 
2) For Paul did not emphasize this reason of proof so} 
carefully in vain. For 


1) Cf. cap. 2, §§ 137, 237, 239. 
2) vitarn, which the Wittenberg and the Jena offer, is missing in the| 
Erlanger. 





In the spirit he foresaw that this evil would occur in the 
church, that the word GO1tes would be mixed, that is, 
that the promise would be mixed with the law and thus 
the whole promise would be lost; for when the promise 
is mixed with the law, it becomes a mere law. 

421. Therefore, you must get used to distinguish the 
law and the promise, even according to the time, so that 
when the law comes and accuses the conscience, you 
can say: Madam Law, thou comest not in due season, 
but too soon; wait yet 430 years, when these shall have 
passed, and then thou mayest come. But if you come 
then, you will come too late, because the promise has 
preceded you by 430 years, which | agree with and am 
gladly satisfied with. Therefore | have nothing to do with 
you, | do not hear you, because | now live with the 
believing Abraham or rather according to the already 
appeared Christ, who is my righteousness, who has 
taken away and abolished the law. So Christ should 
always be in the heart's mind as a kind of summary of all 
the reasons for faith against the righteousness of the 
flesh, the law, works and merits. 

422 So far | have given almost all the reasons, the 
most powerful ones, that Paul uses in this epistle to 
confirm the doctrine of justification, among which the 
most important and powerful is the one that he 
emphasizes especially here and in the letter to the 
Romans, namely, the reason of the promise made to 
Abraham and the other fathers, whose words he 
considers most carefully. Furthermore, he also deals 
with times and persons, likewise he emphasizes the 
word "seed" and explains that the same is Christ. Finally, 
he also shows by contrast what the law does, namely, 
that it concludes under the curse. And so he fortifies and 
defends the article of Christian righteousness with the 
strongest grounds of proof. 

423. On the other hand, he overturns the arguments 
of the false apostles, which they have used to defend 
righteousness from the law, and he judges them against 
themselves, that is, where they claim that righteousness 
and life are obtained through the law, he shows that the 
law is not a law. 


402 Dri. Kai. Il, 52-SS. 


Paul, that it only brings about curses and death. You 
insist, he says, that the law is necessary for salvation; 
have you not read that it says [Deut. 18:5], "Whosoever 
shall do them shall live by them"? But who does it? No 
one. Therefore all who deal with the works of the law are 
under the curse. And elsewhere [1 Cor. 15:56] it is said, 
"The sting of death is sin, but the power of sin is the law." 
Now follows the conclusion of these reasons of proof. 


V. 18 For if the inheritance were acquired by law, 
it would not be given by promise. 


424 Thus it is said in Romans 4:14: "For where they 
that are of the law are heirs, faith is nothing, and the 
promise is abolished." It cannot be otherwise, for this 
difference is quite clear, that the law is something quite 
different from the promise; indeed, natural reason, blind 
as it is, must admit that to promise is something different 
from to require, to give something different from to 
receive. The law demands our works, the promise of the 
seed offers us God's spiritual and eternal benefits, and 
that free of charge, for the sake of Christ. 

425 So it is from the promise, not from the law, that 
we obtain the inheritance or blessing, because the 
promise says: "Through your seed shall all the nations of 
the earth be blessed. Therefore, he who has the law 
does not have enough, because he does not yet have 
the blessing, without which he must remain under the 
curse. Therefore, the law cannot justify, because the 
blessing is not added to it. Then, if the inheritance came 
from the law, God would be found to be a liar, and the 
promise would be taken away. Likewise, if the law could 
obtain the blessing, why would God make the promise 
from it: "In your seed" 2c.? Why would He not rather have 
said: Do this and you will receive the blessing, or: You 
can earn eternal life by doing the law? This reason for 
proof is based on the fact that the opposite is impossible 


(eX contrariis est). The inheritance is given by the 
promise, not by the law.

But God gave it freely to Abraham through the 
promise. 


Here it cannot be denied that God, before the law, 
gave Abraham the blessing or inheritance through the 
promise, that is, the forgiveness of sins, righteousness, 
blessedness, eternal life, so that we would be children 
and heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, because He 
clearly says in the first book of Moses: "Through your 
seed shall all nations be blessed. There the blessing has 
been bestowed without all regard to law and works. For 
GOD preceded with the giving of the inheritance before 
Moses was born or any man thought of the law. What 
then do you boast that righteousness is obtained through 
the law, since your father Abraham was given 
righteousness, life and blessedness without the law and 
before the law, even before those who could keep the 
law? Whom this does not move is blind and hardened. 
But | have above diligently and abundantly dealt with the 
reason of the promise, therefore | will now run through it 
only above. 

So far, the main part of this epistle has been treated. 
Now Paul will show the custom and the office of the law, 
using parables of the disciplinarian and the young heir, 
as well as the image of the two sons of Abraham, Isaac 
and Ishmael 2c.; finally, he gives commands concerning 


a right conduct (de moribus). In this last part of the 
epistle, Paul proceeds more in an oratorical manner than 
that he teaches (plus rhetoricatur quam docet). 


V. 19. What is the law for? 


If we teach that man is justified without law and 
works, this question necessarily follows: If the law does 
not justify, for what purpose is the law given? Likewise: 
Why does God press and burden us with the law if it does 
not make alive? What is the need for us to be so severely 
afflicted and martyred with it, when those who have 
worked only one hour are made like us who have borne 
the burden and heat of the day? When grace comes, 
which preaches the gospel, this great murmur 
immediately arises.

without which the Gospel cannot be preached. 

The Jews had this opinion that they would be justified 
if they kept the law. Therefore, when they heard that the 
gospel was preached of Christ, who came into the world 
not to save the righteous but sinners, and that these 
should enter the kingdom of heaven before them, they 
became extremely indignant and complained that for so 
many centuries they had borne the heavy yoke of the law 
with great trouble and labor, and that they had been most 
miserably martyred and oppressed by the tyranny of the 
law, without any benefit, even to their greatest harm; On 
the other hand, grace is granted to the idolatrous 
Gentiles without any labor or complaint. 

430 Our papists grumble today and say: What has it 
availed us that we have lived twenty, thirty, forty years in 
monasticism, that we have vowed chastity, poverty, 


obedience, that we have kept our times of prayer (legisse 


horas canonicas), said mass, martyred the body with 
fasting, prayers, scourging 2c., if a husband, a wife, a 
prince, a mayor, a teacher, a student, if a day laborer or 
a servant who carries sacks, if a maid who sweeps the 
house, are not only equal to us but also better and more 
worthy than we are? 

431 Therefore this is a difficult question, by which 
reason is resolved, nor can it solve it, but it is very vexed 
with it. For reason understands to some extent the 
righteousness of the law, which it also teaches and 
insists upon, and it imagines that those are righteous who 
carry it out, but it does not understand the office and 
purpose of the law. Therefore, when it hears this new 
saying of Paul, which is unknown to the world, that the 
law was given for the sake of sin, it judges that Paul 
abolishes the law because he says that we are not 
justified by it; indeed, he blasphemously acts against 
God, who gave the law, because he says that it was 
given for the sake of sins. Let us therefore live like the 
Gentiles who do not have the Law, yes, let us sin and 
remain in sin, so that the 





grace becomes all the more powerful. Likewise: Let us 
do evil that good may come of it. This happened to the 
apostle Paul, and the same happens to us today. For 
when the mob hears from the Gospel that we are given 
righteousness by the grace of God alone, through faith 
alone, without law and works, they conclude in the same 
way as the Jews did at that time, "If the law does not 
make us righteous, let us do no more good works. 
What shall we do now? The fact that it is so evil is 
certainly a great plague for us, but we cannot prevent it. 
When Christ preached, he heard that he was a 
blasphemer and a rebel, that is, that he deceived the 
people by his teaching and made them rebel against 
Caesar. The same happened to Paul and all the 
apostles. What wonder is it that today the world accuses 
us in the same way? Of course, it may blaspheme and 
persecute us, but for this reason we must not be silent, 
but speak freely, so that the afflicted consciences may 
be torn from the devil's snares, and we must not see to 
it that the godless and foolish mob abuses our teaching, 


that it cannot be helped (sanari), whether it has the law 
or not, but rather we must see to it that the wretched 
consciences are advised, so that they do not get lost with 
the great multitude. If we were silent, consciences 
everywhere would have no consolation, who are so 
imprisoned and entangled by laws and human statutes 
that they cannot wriggle out in any way. 

433 Just as Paul, when he saw that some opposed 
his teaching and others sought carnal freedom and 
became angry, consoled himself in this way that he was 
an apostle of Jesus Christ, sent to preach the faith of 
God's elect, and that he tolerated everything for the sake 
of the elect, so that they too might attain salvation, so we 
also do everything today for the sake of the elect, whom 
we know will be helped by our teaching. 

434 But to the dogs and sows, some of whom 
persecute the doctrine, others our freedom, which we 
have in Christ, with 


406 Lri. 6ai. Il, 87-60. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2244-2248. 


407 





| am so much as a fool that | would not speak a word in 
my whole life for their sake. | would rather that our sows 
were still under the tyranny of the pope with our 
adversaries, the dogs, than that the holy name of God 
should be so blasphemed for their sake. 

435 Therefore, no matter how much, not only the 
unintelligent rabble, but also those who consider 
themselves very wise, may conclude in this way: If the 
law does not justify, it is useless; nevertheless, this is not 
true. For just as this conclusion is no good: Money does 
not justify, therefore it is useless; eyes do not justify, 
therefore they must be plucked out; hands do not justify, 
therefore they must be cut off: so neither does this 
conclusion: The law does not justify, therefore it is 
useless. One must attach to every thing its proper office 
and custom. In this way we do not destroy or condemn 
the law by saying that it does not justify, but we answer 
this question, "What then is the law for?" in a different 
way from the adversaries, who in their wrong opinion 
attribute to the law an office and a custom which it does 
not have. 

436 Against this abuse and the fancied office of the 
law we contend, and answer with Paul, that the law 
justifieth not; but in this we do not affirm that the law is 
useless, as those immediately conclude, If the law 
justifieth not, it is given in vain. No, for it has its own 
office and custom, but not that which the adversaries 
impute to it, namely, that it should make men righteous. 
Yes, it accuses, frightens and condemns them. We say 
with Paul that the law is good when it is used rightly, that 
is, when it is used as a law. If | describe the law rightly 


according to the explanation (definitione) that belongs 
to it, and keep it in its office and use, it is something very 
good. But if | place it in a different usage, and attach to 
it what need not be attached to it, | pervert not only the 
law, but also the whole theology. 

437 Thus Paul acts here against the corrupt 
hypocrites, to whom this word of Paul: "The law is for 
sins. 


came," was quite intolerable. For they think that the 
office of the law is to do justice; and this is the general 
opinion of human reason among all the sophists and the 
whole world, that justice is brought about by the works 
of the law: this pernicious delusion reason does not allow 
to be taken away in any way, because it does not 
understand the justice of faith. 

438 Hence it is that the papists speak not so foolishly 
as ungodly: The Church has the Law of God, the 
traditions of the Fathers, the decisions of the Councils; if 
it lives by them, it is holy. No one will persuade these 
people that by keeping these things they only provoke 
the wrath of God, but do not please Him. In short, every 
worksaint imagines that he can appease the wrath of 
God through his self-chosen worship and through the 


spiritual state (voluntaria religione) he has adopted 
according to his own will 2c. 


Therefore, the delusion that 


righteousness by one's own works (Opinio justitiae) is 
the mud pit from which all misfortune arises, and the 
greatest sin in the world. For gross sins and vices can 
be recognized, and therefore they can be corrected or at 
least prevented by the punishment of the authorities; but 
this sin (every man's delusion of his own righteousness) 
not only does not want to be sin, but also pretends to be 
the highest godliness and righteousness. Therefore this 
corruption is the highest and greatest rule of the devil on 
the whole earth, in truth the serpent's head, and the rope 
with which the devil catches and holds all men captive, 
for all by nature think that the law justifies. 

440 In order to show the true office and the right use 
of the law and to remove the false delusion about it from 
the people, Paul answers this objection: "What is the 
purpose of the law if it does not make righteous? in this 
way: It is not given that it should make righteous, but: 


one can_ attain 


It has come to this for the sake of sins. 


As the things themselves are different, so also the 
custom of the things is different. 


408 Nri. ttra. n. 60-62. Exec. Explanation of Galatians 3, 


19. W. VIII, 2248-2251. 409 





Therefore one should not mix the customs with each 
other, otherwise a confusion of things will occur. [Deut. 
22:5, "A woman shall not wear a man's apparel, neither 
shall a man put on a woman's apparel." A man shall do 
the works of a man, a woman those of a woman. Each 
shall do that which his profession and office require. 
Pastors and preachers shall teach the word of God 
purely. The authorities shall govern the subjects, who 
shall be obedient to the authorities 2c. Likewise, every 
creature shall serve in its order and place. The sun shall 
shine by day, the moon and the stars by night; the sea 
shall yield fish, the earth fruit, the woods game, wood 2c. 
Thus the law shall not arrogate to itself a foreign office 
or custom, namely, that it justifies, but shall leave this to 
grace alone, to promise, to faith. 

1442. What then is the office of the law? It has to do 


with sins (transgressio), or, as he says elsewhere 
[Rom. 5, 20.]: "The law came in beside, that sin might 
become more powerful." Truly, a beautiful post! He says: 
"The law came in for sins, that is, over the promises, and 
after them it was added, "until the seed should come, 
Christ, to whom the promise was made." 


Of the twofold manch of the law. 


?Here one must know that there is a twofold custom 
of the law. One is the civil custom. For God has ordained 
the civil, yes, all laws, in order to ward off sin. So every 
law is given to prevent sins. If it resists sins, does it not 
justify them? Not at all. For if | do not kill, if | do not 
commit adultery, if | do not steal, if | abstain from other 
sins, | do not do it willingly. 


1) This paragraph is used by Aurifaber for § 4 of the 12th chapter 
of the Table Talks, in the translation of Menius. In our edition of the 
Table Talks, it is omitted. 

2) § 443, § 444 and the beginning of ? 445 are used by Aurifaber 
(in the translation of Menius) for the first part of § 5 of the 7th chapter

or out of love for virtue, but because | fear prison, the 
sword and the executioner. This prevents me from 
sinning, just as bonds and fetters prevent a lion or bear 
from devouring everything in its path. 

444 Thus the restraint of sins is not justice, but rather 
a sign of unrighteousness. For just as a fetter is put ona 
raging and untamed beast so that it cannot rage against 
everything that comes in its way, so the law restrains the 
senseless and raging man so that he does not sin 
according to his desires. This constraint shows 
sufficiently that those who need it (as all who are apart 
from Christ) are not righteous, but rather ungodly and 
angry people who must be kept in check with the bonds 
and prisons of the law so that they do not sin. So the law 
does not justify. 

445 Therefore, the first thing to know about the laws 
and the first thing to use them for is to keep the wicked 
in check. For the devil rules in the whole world and drives 
people to all kinds of shameful deeds. That is why God 
has established authorities, parents, teachers, laws, 
bonds and all civil orders, so that, if they can do nothing 
else, they may at least bind the hands of the devil, so 
that he cannot rage in his own people as he pleases. 
Just as, therefore, bands and fetters must be put on 
possessed people, in whom the devil reigns mightily, so 
that they do not injure anyone, so for the whole world, 
which is possessed by the devil and is carried away 
head over heels into all deeds of shame, the authorities 
are there with their bands and fetters, that is, with their 
laws, and bind them hand and foot, so that they do not 
fall head over heels into all kinds of shame and vice. If 
she does not let herself be restrained in this way, the 
death penalty is carried out on her. This civil coercion is 
extremely necessary and instituted by God, both for the 
sake of public peace and to preserve all things, but 
especially so that the course of the Gospel is not 
hindered by unrest and rebellion of violent people.

411 





446 Paul does not speak of this civil custom here. It 
is very necessary, but it does not make one righteous. 
For just aS a possessed man is not free and sane 
because his hands and feet are bound, so also the world, 
no matter how much it may be restrained by the law from 
outward deeds of shame, is not just because of this, but 
remains godless. Yes, this constraint shows that the 
world is godless, that it is raging and driven by its prince, 
the devil, otherwise it would not be necessary for it to be 
held in check by laws so that it does not sin. 

‘The other custom of the Law is a theological or 
spiritual one, which consists (as Paul says) in multiplying 
sins, that is, revealing to man his sin, his blindness, his 
misery, his godlessness, his ignorance of God, his 
hatred and contempt for God, that he deserves death, 
hell, judgment and wrath from God. The 7th chapter of 
the Epistle to the Romans deals with this custom very 
well; however, it is completely unknown to hypocrites 
and sophists, as well as to all people who are under the 
delusion that they can attain righteousness through the 
law or through themselves. 

448. But in order for God to tame and overcome this 
monster and this raging beast (the delusion of one's own 
righteousness or spirituality), which by nature makes 
people puffed up and proud, so that they think they 
please God for its sake, he had to send a Hercules, who 
attacked this monster with full force, threw him down and 
finished him off, that is, he had to give the law on Mount 
Sinai with such great pomp and such a frightening 
outward appearance that all the people were terrified, 2 
Mos. 19, 18. 20, 18. 

449. As this custom of the law is the true and principal 
one, so it is also very useful and exceedingly necessary. 
For if a man is not a murderer, an adulterer, a thief, and 
keeps himself outwardly pure from sins, as that Pharisee 
[Luc. 18, 11.]

§ 5 of the 12th chapter of the Table Talks, in the translation of Menius.

would swear (because he is possessed by the devil) that 
he is righteous; therefore, he is delusional about [his 
own] righteousness and is presumptuous about his good 
works and merits. By no other art can God soften and 
humble such a man, that he may know his misery and 
damnation, than by the law. For this is the hammer of 
death, the thunder of hell and the lightning of divine 
wrath, which crushes the hardened and unreasonable 
hypocrites. 

450. Therefore, the proper and right custom of the 
Law is to terrify (as on Mount Sinai) by lightning, thunder, 
and the sound of a trumpet, to strike down and crush by 
a thunderclap this beast, which is called the delusion of 
[one's] righteousness. Therefore, God says through the 
prophet Jeremiah [Cap. 23, 29.], "My word is a hammer 
that shatters rocks." For as long as the delusion of one's 
own righteousness remains in man, there also remains 
an immeasurable pride, presumption, certainty, hatred of 
GOD, contempt for grace and mercy, ignorance 
regarding the promises and Christ. It does not enter the 
heart, nor does it taste the sermon of the forgiveness of 
sins in vain for the sake of Christ, because an immense 
rock and diamond wall, namely the delusion of one's own 
righteousness, stands against it, by which the heart is 
surrounded. 

Just as the delusion of one's own righteousness is a 
great and terrifying monster, a rebellious, obstinate and 
exceedingly stubborn beast, so God, in order to put it 
down and crush it, requires a tremendous and strong 
hammer, namely the law. This is then in its proper office 
and custom, when it so accuses and denounces sin: 
Behold, you have transgressed all the commandments 
of God, 2c., and so frightens the conscience that it feels 
in truth that God is offended and angry, and that it is 
guilty of eternal death. Then the heart feels the 
unbearable burden of the law and is crushed to the point 
of despair, so that it wishes for death from too much fear, 
or thinks of killing itself. 

452 Therefore the law is the hammer, the fire, the 
wind, and the great mighty earthquake that breaks rocks 
and smashes mountains. 


412 Li. 6ai. Il, 64-66. Explanation of Galatians 3, 19, W. VIII, 2254-2257. 


413 





that is, the hardened and arrogant hypocrites. The 
prophet Elijah could not bear these terrors of the law, 
which are signified by these things, and he covered his 
head with his mantle, 1' Kings 19:11-13. But when this 
storm ceased, which he witnessed, there came a quiet, 
gentle whirlwind in which the Lord was. But the storm 
with fire, tempest wind and earthquake had to precede 
before the Lord Himself followed in the quiet gentle 
soughing. 

This custom of the Law was modeled on that terrible 
sight and splendor with which God gave the Law from 
Mount Sinai. It was the greatest sanctity among the 
people of Israel who had come out of Egypt. We (they 
boasted) are the people of God; everything that the Lord 
our God has spoken, we will do. Then Moses sanctified 
the people, commanded that they wash their clothes, 
abstain from their wives, and prepare themselves for the 
third day. Then every one was exceedingly holy. On the 
third day Moses led the people out of the camp to meet 
God at the foot of the mountain, so that they might hear 
the voice of the LORD. What happened? When the 
children of Israel saw the terrifying sight of the mountain, 
how it smokes and burns, the black clouds and the 
flashing lightnings in the thickest darkness, and heard 
how the sound of the trumpets gradually increased and 
echoed longer and longer, likewise when they heard the 
thunder and saw the lightnings, they retreated in fright 
and stood afar off and said to Moses: We will gladly do 
anything, only may the LORD not speak to us, lest we 
die and this very great fire devour us. Teach us, and we 
will hear. What, | pray thee, is the use here of purity, of 
white garments, of abstaining from women, of holiness? 
Nothing at all. No one could bear this presence of GOD 
in His majesty and glory, but all went back frightened and 
horrified, as if the devil were driving them. For God is a 
consuming fire, before whose face no flesh can stand. 

454 This office has therefore actually the divine law, 
which it had at that time on the mountain. 


1) In the Vulgate: "3 Reg." - "3" is missing in the Erlanger. 





Sinai, when it was first given, and washed, righteous, 
cleansed and chaste people heard it, and yet it brought 
these saints to the realization of their misery, to despair 
and death. At that time there was no purity, but the 


awareness (sensus) of their impurity, unworthiness, sin, 
judgment and wrath of God was so great that they fled 
away from God and could not hear His voice. "What is all 
flesh," they said [Deut. 5:26], "that it may hear the voice 
of the living GOD, and remain alive?" [V. 24. 25.:] "Today 
we have seen that when GOD speaks to man, man 
cannot bear it." Now they speak much differently than 
shortly before, when they said: "We are God's holy 
people, whom the Lord has chosen as his own above all 
peoples on earth. We will do everything the Lord has 
said. 

This is how it is with all saints of works who, drunk 
with the delusion of their own righteousness when they 
are not challenged, think that they are very much loved 
by God, that God sees their vows, fasts, prayers and self- 
chosen works, for which He will give them a special 
crown in heaven. But when suddenly thunder, lightning, 
fire and the hammer that breaks the rocks come, that is, 
when the Law of God reveals sin, shows the wrath and 
judgment of God, then the same thing happens to them 
as happened to the Jews who stood at the foot of Mount 
Sinai. 

71 exhort all lovers of godliness, especially those who 
will one day be the teachers of others, to learn diligently 
from Paul's writings, that they may rightly know the right 
and proper usage of the law, which (I fear) after our times 
will again be obscured and altogether suppressed. For 
since we are still alive and display with the greatest 
diligence the office and custom of both the law and the 
gospel, there are very few even among those who want 
to be considered godly, and with us

confess the gospel, who have this rightly in mind. What 
do you think will happen when we get there? 

In the meantime, | will say nothing of the Anabaptists, 
the new Arians, and the spirits who blaspheme against 
the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, who 
likewise do not know this, no matter how much they 
speak differently with their mouths, just as the Papists 
do. For they have already fallen back from the pure 
teaching of the Gospel to the laws, and therefore they do 
not teach Christ. They boast and swear that they seek 
nothing but the glory of God and the blessedness of the 
brethren, and that they teach the word of God purely, but 
in fact they falsify it and turn it to a meaning that is not in 
it, so that it must say to them what they dream. That is 
why they teach their dreams under the name of Christ, 
and only laws and ceremonies under the name of the 
gospel. Thus, they are and always remain the same as 
they were, that is, monks, laborers, teachers of law and 
ceremonies, only that they think up new names and 
works. 

458 Therefore it is not a small thing to hold 
righteously to what is the law, what is its custom, and 
what is its office. But because we teach this with the 
greatest diligence and most faithfully, we testify by deed 
that we do not reject the law and works, as the 
adversaries falsely accuse us, but we fortify the law most 
strongly, and require its works, and say that the law is 
good and useful, but [only] in its [proper] use, namely, 
first, to control civil transgressions, and second, to reveal 
and make greater spiritual transgressions. 

Therefore the law is also a light that shines, showing 
not the grace of God, not righteousness and life, but sin, 
death, wrath and the judgment of God. For just as on 
Mount Sinai the thunder, the lightning, the dark cloud, 
the smoking and burning mountain, and all that terrifying 
sight, did not make the children of Israel joyful nor revive 
them, but terrified them, made them almost lifeless, and 
showed how, with all their holiness and purity, the 


415 


The law, when it is in its rightful function, does nothing 
but reveal sin, cause wrath, accuse people and frighten 
them so that they are not far away from despair. This is 
the actual custom of the law, which has its end here and 
does not have to go further. 

The gospel, on the other hand, is a light that 
enlightens, gives life, comforts and reassures fearful 
minds. For it shows that God is merciful to sinners and 
those who are not worthy of it, for Christ's sake, if they 
believe that through his death they are freed from the 
curse, that is, from sin and eternal death, and that 
through his victory they are given the blessing, that is, 
grace, forgiveness of sins, righteousness and eternal 
life. By thus distinguishing the law from the gospel, we 
ascribe to each its proper custom and office. 1) Of this 
difference of the Law and the Gospel one reads nothing 
in the books of the monks, of the teachers of papal law, 
of the school theologians, not even in those of the 
ancient Fathers. Augustine knew and indicated this 
difference in part, but Jerome and others did not know 
anything about it. 

In short, for many centuries there has been complete 
silence about this in all schools and churches, so that 
one must wonder about it, and this circumstance has put 
consciences in very great danger. For if the gospel is not 
clearly distinguished from the law, Christian doctrine 
cannot be preserved unadulterated. On the other hand, 
if this distinction is rightly recognized, then the right way 
to be justified is also recognized, and then it is easy to 
distinguish faith from works, Christ from Moses and all 
worldly laws. For apart from Christ, everything is an 
office of death for vengeance on the wicked. Paul 
therefore answers this question thus:

The law came to this for the sake of sins. 


That is, so that sins would be greater and would be 
recognized and seen all the better, and indeed this is 
what happens. For when sin is revealed to a man 
through the law, death, wrath and judgment of God, hell 
2c., it is impossible for him not to become impatient, not 
to grumble, to hate God and His will. For he cannot suffer 
the judgment of God, that he should die and be damned, 
and yet he cannot escape. Because of this, he inevitably 
comes to hate God and blaspheme Him. 

Before, except for the challenge, he was a great saint, 
serving and praising God, bowing his knees and giving 
thanks like the Pharisee Luc. 18. But now that sin and 
death are revealed, he wanted there to be no God. 
Therefore the law causes one to hate God supremely, 
and this does not only mean that through the law one 
sees and recognizes sin, but also that through this 


manifestation [of sin] sin is increased, inflamed, ignited 
and made great. Therefore Paul says Rom. 7, 13: "Sin, 
that it might appear as it is sin, it hath wrought death for 
me through good, that sin might be exceedingly found by 
the commandment." There he deals very extensively 
with this effect of the law. 

464 To this question, "If the law does not justify, what 
does it serve?" Paul gives this answer: "Although it does 
not justify, the law is very useful and necessary. First, in 
civil usage it keeps the carnally-minded and crude 
people in check. Secondly, it shows man what he is like; 
that he is a sinner, therefore guilty of death and worthy 
of eternal wrath. What is the purpose of this humiliation, 
the smashing and crushing with this hammer, namely the 
law? It serves that grace may have access to us. Thus, 


the law is a servant and a preparator (praeparatrix) for 
grace. For God is a God of the humble, the wretched, the 
afflicted, the oppressed, the despairing, and of those 
who have become nothing at all, and His fine 
consecration is that He exalts the lowly, the hungry, and 
the unhappy. 





417 


He feeds the hungry, enlightens the blind, comforts the 
miserable and the afflicted, justifies sinners, gives life to 
the dead, and saves the desperate and the damned 2c. 
For he is the almighty creator who makes everything out 
of nothing. 

But the most harmful corruption, the delusion of his 
own righteousness, does not let him come to this work 


that lies in his nature (naturale) and is peculiar to him, 
because he does not want to be a sinner, not unclean, 
wretched and damned, but righteous, holy 2c. 
Therefore, God must use this hammer, namely the law, 
which breaks, shatters, crushes and makes this beast 
with its futile trust, wisdom, justice, power 2c. completely 
and utterly nothing, so that it finally learns through its 
misfortune that it is lost and damned. And there, when 
the conscience is so terrified by the law, the doctrine of 
the gospel and of grace has a place, which restores and 
comforts, saying that Christ came into the world, not to 
break the bruised reed, not to quench the smoldering 
wick [Isa. 42:3], but to preach the gospel to the poor, to 
bind up the brokenhearted, to preach a remission to the 
captives 2c. [Isa. 61, 1.] 

But here it takes work and effort for a man who is so 
frightened and crushed by the law to be able to stand up 
again and say: Now | am sufficiently crushed and 
afflicted; the time of the law has made me miserable 
enough and afflicted me. Now it is time for grace, and to 
hear Christ, from whose mouth the sermons of grace 
flow. Now it is time to look not at the smoking and 
burning Mount Sinai, but at Mount Moria, where is the 
dwelling place, the temple and the mercy seat of God, 
namely Christ, who is the King of righteousness and 
peace. There | will hear what the LORD will speak to me; 
but he speaks of peace to his people. 

But so great is the foolishness of the human heart 
that in this battle of conscience, when the law has done 
its work and exercised its right use, it not only fails to 
grasp the doctrine of grace, which most certainly 
promises and accepts the forgiveness of sins for Christ's 
sake, but it also fails to grasp the doctrine of the Lord. 


418 Lri. 6ai. Il, 71-73. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2265-2268. 


419 


but seeks even more laws by which he wants to create 


advice for himself. He says: If | live longer, | will improve 
my life, do this or that. Likewise: | will go to a monastery, 
live in the most miserable way, be content with water and 
bread, go barefoot 2c. If you do not do the opposite here, 
that is, if you do not relegate Moses with his law to the 
safe and hardened, and in this fear and terror take hold 
of Christ, who suffered, was crucified and died for your 
sins, then your salvation is completely lost. 

468 Thus the law with its office (which is only 


incidental, not its actual work [per accidens}) also 
serves for justification, in that it does not make righteous, 
but it urges toward the promise of grace, and makes it 
sweet and desirable. Therefore we do not dismiss the 
law, but show its proper function and use, namely, that it 
is a very useful servant that leads to Christ. Therefore, 
after the law has humbled you, frightened you and 
completely crushed you, so that you are now extremely 
close to despair, see to it that you know how to use the 
law properly, because its office and custom is not only to 
show sin and the wrath of God, but also to drive you to 
Christ. This use of the law is indicated only by the Holy 
Spirit in the Gospel, where He testifies that God is with 
those who are brokenhearted 2c. 

469 Therefore, when thou art bruised with this 
hammer, use not this bruisedness in a wrong way, that 
thou mayest burden thyself with more laws, but hear 
Christ saying [Matt. 11:28], "Come unto me, all ye that 
labor and are heavy laden, and | will give you rest." If the 
law so urges you, when all your affairs are in despair, to 
seek help and comfort in Christ, then it is in its right use, 
and serves through the gospel for the attainment of 
righteousness; and this is the best and most perfect use 
of the law. 

Therefore, Paul begins here to treat the law from a 


new point of view (NOVO Capite) and describes what it is, 
having therefore been given the opportunity. 





that he had said that the law does not make righteous. 
For when reason hears this, it immediately concludes: 
So God gave it in vain. It was therefore necessary to ask, 
to describe and to answer correctly what the law was and 
how it was to be understood, so that it would not be taken 
more broadly or more narrowly than it should be. He 
says: "In order to attain righteousness, no law is 
absolutely necessary. 

Therefore, when one has to deal with righteousness, 
life, and eternal salvation, one must put the law 
completely out of sight, as if it had never been or would 
never be, but were absolutely nothing, for in the business 
of justification no one can put the law far enough out of 
sight and look only at the promise. That is why | said that 
the law and the promise must be separated from each 
other as far as possible in the heart, because in the 
matter itself they are very closely connected. 


Until the seed comes to whom the promise has been 
made. 


472 Paul does not make the law perpetual, but says 
that it is given and added to the promises for the sake of 
sins, namely, civilly, to keep them in check, but especially 
theologically, to reveal them and make them greater, and 
this also not forever, but only for a time. Here one must 
pay attention to the determination of "when" 1) namely, 
how long the rule or tyranny of the law should last, which 
reveals sin and shows us what we are like and makes 
the wrath of God known to us. Those who seriously feel 
this would suddenly perish if they did not receive comfort. 
Therefore, if the time of the law were not shortened, no 
man would be saved. Therefore, the law must be given 
a time and measure beyond which it may not reign. 

How long, then, shall the dominion of the law last? 
Until the seed comes,

translated by "category of time". About "categories" compare Walch, 
St. Louis edition, volume XVIII, 1132, note.

421 





namely the one of whom it is written: "Through your seed 
all nations shall be blessed" [Gen. 22:18.fi So long shall 
the tyranny of the law last, until the fullness of time and 
that seed of blessing come, not that the law itself brings 
the seed or gives righteousness, but that in civil life it 
keeps wild men in check and keeps them as in a prison, 


but in spiritual life (theologice) it keeps the innocent, 
humble and terrifies and forces those who are thus 
humiliated 1) and broken to desire that blessed seed. 

474 The time, how long the law should last, can be 
understood both according to the letter and spiritually. 
According to the letter, the law lasted until the time of 
grace. "The law and the prophets (says Christ [Matth. 
11, 13. 12.]) prophesied until John. From the days of 
John until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, 
and those who do violence snatch it to themselves.” At 
this time Christ was baptized and began to preach, 
where also according to the letter the law and the whole 
Mosaic service ceased. Spiritually, the law should not 
reign in the conscience longer than the time predestined 
for this blessed seed. So when the law has shown me 
sin, frightened me and revealed the wrath and judgment 
of God, so that | begin to blanch, to despair 2c., then the 
law has its prescribed measure, time and end, so that it 
should cease to exercise its tyranny, because it has then 
completed its office; it has sufficiently shown and 
frightened the wrath of God. Here it must be said: desist, 
law, you have sufficiently terrified and crushed, all your 
curses have come upon me, your terror has afflicted me 
[Ps. 88, 8.fi Likewise: O LORD, turn not thy face in anger 
from thy servant; alas, | beseech thee, chasten me not 
in thy wrath 2c. [Ps. 6:2.] 

475. When this fear and such lamentations come, 
then is the time and hour of the blessed seed. Let the 
law therefore depart, which, though to reveal the sins, 
and to make them manifest 


1) In the Wittenberg: inhumiliatos instead of: humiliatos. 





but only until the seed comes; when the seed is present, 
the law shall cease to reveal sins and to terrify, and shall 
give dominion to another, namely, to the blessed seed, 
that is, to Christ, who has blessed lips, with which he 
does not accuse, terrify 2c., but speaks of far better 
things than the law, namely, grace, peace, forgiveness 
of sins, victory over sin, death 2c., which were obtained 
by his death and resurrection, and are given to those 
who believe. 

So Paul shows with these words: "Until the seed 
comes, to whom the promise was made", how long the 
law should last according to the letter and spiritually. 
According to the letter, it ceased when that blessed seed 
took our flesh, came into the world, gave the Holy Spirit, 
and wrote a new law in the hearts 2c. The spiritual 
duration of the law, however, does not cease at once, 
but hangs exceedingly tenaciously in the conscience. 
Therefore, it is very difficult for a person who is plagued 
by the theological custom of the law to see the end of 
the law, because in this terror and feeling of sin, the mind 
cannot grasp the hope that God is merciful, that He 
wants to forgive sins for the sake of Christ, but rather 
judges that God is angry with sinners, that He accuses 
and condemns them. If faith is not added to this, which 
in turn can help, or, according to Christ's words [Matth. 
18, 20]: "Where two or three are gathered," 2c., there is 
a brother who comforts with the word of God the one 
who is so downcast and crushed by the law, then 
despair and death follow. 

This is why it is very bad for a man, especially a 
challenged one, to be alone. "Woe to him who is alone! 
If he falls, there is no one to help him up," says 
Ecclesiastes [Cap. 4:10]. Therefore, those who have 
instituted monasticism or the solitary life have given 
countless people cause to despair. If someone, in order 
to pray, would withdraw for a day or two from the 
intercourse with people (as we read of Christ, that he 
sometimes went alone on a mountain), then he would 
be in despair.

423 





and spent the night in prayer), there would have been no 
danger. But the fact that they have forced people into 
constant loneliness is the devil's fault. For when a man 
is challenged and alone, he cannot counsel himself, not 
even in the slightest affliction. 


And is provided by the angels, by the hand of the 
Mediator. 


This is asmall digression, which Paul neither explains 
nor carries out, but only touches upon in passing and 
passes over. For he soon returns to the matter of which 
he is speaking, namely, at the words [v. 21.], "How? is 
then the law contrary to God's promises?" But this is the 
cause of the digression: it occurred to him that in this 
also there was a difference between the law and the 
gospel, that the law, which had been added to the 
promises, differed from the gospel not only in time, but 


also as to the author (auctore) or the effecting cause. . 
For the law was given through the angels, Hebr. 2, 2, but 
the gospel through the Lord Himself. Therefore the 
gospel surpasses the law, because the law is the word 
of servants, but the gospel of the Lord. 

479 Therefore, in order to diminish the law, but to 
exalt the gospel, he says that the law was a doctrine that 
lasted only a very short time (for it lasted only until the 
fulfillment of the promise, that is, until the blessed seed 
that fulfilled the promise), but the gospel was eternal. For 
all believers have had it from the beginning of the world 
and have been saved by it. The law is therefore far 
inferior to the gospel because it was given by the 
servants, the angels, and only lasted a short time, but 
the gospel was given by the Lord Himself, Hebr. 1, 2. 
and as eternal because it was promised before the times 
of the world, Tit. 1, 2. 

480 Then the preaching of the Law is not only by the 
angels, who are servants, but also by another servant 
who is inferior to the angels, namely a man, that is (as 
he says here), "by the hand of the mediator", that is, 
Moses. Christ 


but is not a servant, but the Lord Himself. He is not a 
mediator between God and men according to the law, 
like Moses, but he is the mediator of a better testament 
[Hebr. 12, 24]. 

481 The law was thus given through the angels, as 
servants, because on Mount Sinai Moses and the 
people heard God speak, that is, the angels who spoke 
in the person of God. Therefore Stephen says in the 7th 
chapter of the Acts of the Apostles [v. 53]: "You received 
the law through the business of angels," that is, through 
the angels who were busy giving it, "and you did not 
keep it." Likewise, the text of Exodus 3:2 clearly states 
that an angel appeared to Moses in the fiery flame and 
spoke to him from the bush. The Latin text is corrupted 
because it does not have the word "angel" but "Lord", 
and because of ignorance of the Hebrew language, this 
passage has become the cause of the dispute whether 
the Lord himself spoke to Moses or an angel. 

Thus Paul indicates that Christ is the mediator of a far 
better testament than Moses, and alludes to the history 
of the proclamation of the law in the 2nd book of Moses, 
in which it is said that Moses led the people out of the 
camp to meet God and placed them at the bottom of the 
mountain. There was a sad and frightening sight, the 
whole mountain was burning 2c. When the people saw 
this, they began to tremble, for they thought that they 
would suddenly perish in this great storm. Because they 
could not bear the law, which sounded terrifyingly from 
Mount Sinai (for this terrible voice of the law would have 
killed the people), they said to the mediator Moses [5 
Mos. 5, 27.]: "Come near, and hear all that the Lord 
says, but you speak with us" 2c., and Moses himself 
says [v. 5.]: "| stood between God and you" and was the 
mediator. From this it is quite clear that Moses was 
appointed mediator between the people and the voice 
1) of the law. 

483. Paul now wants to indicate by this history that it 
is impossible that through

the law could obtain righteousness, as if he wanted to 
say: How could the law justify, since the whole Israelite 
people, since they were sanctified 2c., likewise Moses 
himself, the mediator between GOD and the people, was 
terrified and trembled at the voice of the law, as the 
epistle to the Hebrews [Cap. 12, 21.] says? Here was 
nothing but terror and trembling. But what kind of 
righteousness and holiness is this, if one cannot stand 
the law, yes, cannot hear it nor wants to, but flees and 
hates it, and hates it in such a way that one hates nothing 
more in the whole world? as this history testifies quite 
clearly that the people, just at the hour when they heard 
the law, harbored a greater hatred against nothing than 
against the law, and that they had rather wished for death 
than to hear the law. 

484 When sin has been thus revealed by the rays 
which the law casts into the heart, nothing is more 
detestable and intolerable to man than the law. For then 
he would rather choose death than have to endure these 
terrors of the law even for a very short time, which is a 
sure sign that the law does not justify. For if it did justify, 
men would certainly love it, delight in it, and take it up 
willingly rather than unwillingly. But where is this willing 
reception? Nowhere; neither with Moses nor with the 
whole people; because all fled frightened and trembling. 
But that from which one flees, one does not love, but has 
an aversion against it, one is not delighted by it, but hates 
it to the utmost. Therefore, this flight indicates that the 
human heart has an unlimited hatred against the law and 
consequently also against God Himself, the author of the 
law, and if there were no other reason to prove that 
righteousness could not be obtained from the law, then 
this one history would be sufficient, which Paul indicates 
in the shortest possible way with these words: "By the 
hand of the mediator", as if he wanted to say: Do you not 
remember that your fathers could not even hear the law, 
so that they needed the mediator, Moses? And since he 
was appointed as mediator, so much was lacking in their 
love for the law that they were even in need of it, togethe' 
with 





The people of Egypt, who had been their mediator (as the 
epistle to the Hebrews [Cap. 12, 20. 21.] testifies), 
showed their disgust by a terrifying flight, and if they had 
been able to, they would have returned to Egypt through 
an iron mountain. But the way was barred to them, so that 
they could not escape to any side. Therefore they said to 
Moses [Ex. 20:19, Deut. 5:25], "Speak thou with us, for if 
we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, we 
must die." So if they cannot hear the law. Dear, how 
should they do it? 

Therefore, since the people of the law had to have a 
mediator by necessity, it follows quite irrefutably that the 
law did not make them righteous. What did it do? That 
which Paul says [Rom. 5:20]: "The law came in beside, 
that sin might be made mightier." So the law was the light 
and the sun that sent its rays into the hearts of the 
children of Israel, by which they were terrified, and such 
anger against God and fear of God was instilled in them 
that they felt an abhorrence of the law and of its author, 
which is the most grievous sin. Would you then say that 
such people were righteous? Certainly not. For righteous 
are those who hear the law, take hold of it with all their 
heart's desire, and delight in it. But the history of the 
giving of the law testifies that all people in the whole 
world, however holy they may be (especially since these 
people, who were purified and sanctified, could not hear 
the law), have an aversion to the law, detest and flee it, 
and wish it were not there. So it is impossible for people 
to become righteous by it, but it has the completely 
opposite effect. 

486 Although Paul, as | have said [§478], only 
touches on this piece in passing, does not go into it 
further, nor does he elaborate on it, a diligent and 
attentive reader will recognize without effort that he is 
speaking covertly 1) of both mediators, Moses and Christ, 
and that he is comparing them with one another, as we 
will show soon after. If

426 Lri. 6 "I. Il, 80-83. Interpretations on the Epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2278-2280. 


If he had wanted to treat and carry out this matter in 
detail, this few pieces would have been sufficient to give 
him ample material for writing a new epistle. The history 
of the proclamation of the law in the 2nd book of Moses, 
chap. 19 and 20, would offer material for a large book, if 


one would read it even above unbiased (sine affectu), 
although it seems to be very paltry to those who do not 
know the true office of the law and its custom, if one 
compares it with other sacred histories. 

From this it is evident that if the whole world had 
stood at Mount Sinai like the Israelite people, it would 
also have been terrified and would have fled from the 
law. Thus, the whole world is opposed to the law and 
hates it bitterly. But the law is holy, just and good and a 
right presentation (rectitudo) of the divine will. How, 
then, can he be righteous who not only abhors and flees 
the law, but is also God's enemy, who is the author of the 
law. And yet the flesh cannot do otherwise, as Paul 
testifies in Romans 8:7: "To be carnally minded is enmity 
against God, since it is not subject to the law, for neither 
is it able to be." Therefore, it is the greatest foolishness 
to hate God and His law in such a way that we cannot 
even hear it, and yet claim that we are justified by it. 

Therefore, the sophists are blind and understand 
nothing at all about this trade. They look only at the 
outward appearance of the law and think that it is 


satisfied with civil good conduct (moribUS), and that 
those are righteous before God who do it outwardly, but 
they do not see its true and spiritual effect, which is not 
that it makes righteous and satisfies consciences, but 
that it increases sin, frightens and incites wrath. 

Since they do not know this, they conclude that man 
has a good will and right reason with regard to the Law 


of God. But whether this is true, ask (Consule) the 
people of the Law with their mediator, who heard the Law 
on Mount Sinai. Ask also David about it, who, as often as 
he complains in the Psalms that he has been deprived of 
God's 


427 


He is terrified by the greatness of his sin, the wrath and 
the judgment of God, this unconquerable tyrant, does 
not oppose his sacrifices, not even the law, but only the 
mercy of God, which is bestowed upon him by grace. 
Therefore, the law does not justify. 

490. If the law agreed with my inclinations, that is, if 
it approved my hypocrisy and my own honor, if it 
approved my delusion and my trust in my own 
righteousness, if it allowed that without the mercy of God 
and faith in Christ alone | could become righteous before 
God through His help (as the whole world naturally 
judges the law); then, if it said that God could be 


influenced (flecti) and overcome by works, and become 
guilty of giving a reward to those who do them, that | 
could thus, without needing God, be a god to myself, 
who could earn grace by my works and, with the 
exclusion of Christ's salvation, make myself blessed by 
my merits, if, | say, the law were thus at my will, then it 
would be pleasant, sweet and pleasing to me. Reason 
can flatter itself so excellently. But this would last only 
so long, until the law would come to its actual custom 
and office. Then it would become obvious that reason 
cannot bear the rays of the law, then some Moses would 
have to come and become a mediator, and yet without 
any benefit, as | will soon say. 

491. Here belongs the passage 2 Cor. 3. 7. ff. about 
the hidden face of Moses, where Paul shows from the 
history in the 2nd book of Moses, Cap. 34, 29. ff., that 
the children of Israel not only did not know the right and 
theological custom of the law, but also could not bear it. 
First, because they could not look upon the end of the 
law, Paul says [v. 13.], for the sake of the covering which 
Moses had put before his face. Secondly, they could not 
look at the uncovered face of Moses either, because of 
the clarity of his face. For when Moses wished to speak 
to them, he covered his face with a blanket, without 
which they could not bear his speech, that is, they could 
not even

429 





They could not have heard their mediator Moses, if he 
did not use another mediator, namely the cover. How 
could they have heard God's voice or the voice of an 
angel, since they could not hear the voice of Moses, who 
was their mediator, unless he covered his face? 

492. Therefore, if the blessed seed does not come 
and direct and comfort the one who has heard the Law, 
then he will surely be lost in despair in disgust against 
the Law, in hatred and blasphemy against God, and from 
day to day he will sin angrier against God; for the deeper 
the fear and consternation of conscience that the Law 
produces is ingrained and the longer it lasts, the more 
the hatred and blasphemy against God grows. 

Moreover, this history teaches what the power of free 
will is. The people are frightened and tremble; where is 
free will here, where is good will and right reason? What 
is the value of free will among those who are sanctified 
and purified? It does not know how to help itself, it 
darkens reason and turns away good will, it does not 
accept the Lord who comes to Mount Sinai with thunder, 
lightning and fire, does not greet him and does not seize 
him with joy. He cannot hear the voice of the LORD, but 
says against it, "The LORD speak not unto us, lest we 
die" [Ex. 20:19.]. So we see what power free will has in 
the children of Israel, who, even though they are 
sanctified, will not or cannot even hear a syllable or a 
letter of the law. Therefore, the boast that is made of free 
will is a mere pretense 2c. 


V. 20: But a mediator is not a mediator of one. 

Here he compares these two mediators with each 
other, indeed only casually and in wonderful shortness, 
but nevertheless in such a way that he does enough for 
the attentive reader who immediately understands 
(since the word mediator is a general one) that he 
speaks in general of a mediator, not of Moses alone. "A 
mediator." 


1) Instead of aktsstationk in the Wittenberg has the Jena and the 
Erlangen aktsstinutionk. 





he says, "is not a mediator of one," but this word 
necessarily comprehends two parties, namely an 
insulted and an_ insulter, one of whom _ needs 


intercession (intercessione), the other not. Therefore, 
a mediator is not a mediator of one, but between two, 
and that between such two parties who disagree with 
each other. 

Thus, according to the general explanation, Moses is 
a mediator, because he acts as a mediator between the 
law and the people, who cannot stand the theological 
custom of the law. Therefore, a new face of the law must 
be prepared and its voice changed, that is, the 
theological voice of the law or the living law in the heart 
[of the people] must put on a larva and become such 
through the human voice of Moses that it can be endured 
and heard. 

But when the law is thus fulfilled, it no longer speaks 
in its majesty, but through the mouth of Moses. In this 
way it no longer executes its office, that is, it does not 
instill terror in the consciences, and therefore men then 
do not understand it at all, but become by it only safe, 
snoring and presumptuous hypocrites. And yet one of 
both must happen, namely, that the law is either out of 
its custom, with the cover, but then, as | said, it makes 
hypocrites, or that it is in its custom, without cover, then 
it kills, because the human heart cannot suffer the law in 
its right custom, without cover. 

Therefore, if you want to see the end of the law 
without a covering, you must either take hold of the 
blessed seed in faith (that is, you must look beyond the 
end of the law to Christ, who is the fulfillment of the law, 
who says to you, "The law has frightened you enough; 
be of good cheer, my son, your sins are forgiven you," 
of which | will say more soon), or you must certainly have 
Moses as your mediator with his covering. 

498 Hence it is that Paul uses this general saying and 
says: "A mediator is not a mediator of one. For it was not 
possible that Moses alone should have been God's 
mediator, because God is not a mediator of one. 


430 Lii- 6ai. ii, 85-87. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vni, 2285-2288. 


431 





He is not only the people's mediator, but also the 
mediator between God and the people, who were not at 
ease with God. For this is the office of a mediator, that 
he reconcile the offended part with the one who has 
offended. But Moses, as | have said, is only such a 
mediator who changes the voice of the law and makes it 
so that it is bearable to hear it, but he does not give the 
power to fulfill the law. In short, he is a mediator through 


the cover (velaminis), therefore he does not give power 
over the law, but only covers it. Therefore his disciples, 


as far as he is a Mediator through the cover (mediator 


velaminis), must necessarily remain hypocrites. 

499 But what do you think would have happened if 
the law had been given without Moses, either before or 
after Moses, and there had been no mediator, and yet 
the people could neither have escaped nor had a 
mediator? In this case, the people would either have had 
to die suddenly from too much terror, or, if they were to 
remain unharmed, another mediator would have had to 
come, who would have had to mediate between the law 
and the people in such a way that, while the people 
remained unharmed, the law would also have remained 
in its power, and the people would have come to an 
agreement with the law. In the meantime Moses comes 
and becomes a mediator, makes a larva and hangs the 
ceiling, but he cannot take away the terror of the law from 
the conscience. 

Therefore, when Moses and his cover are taken 
away, when man feels the wrath and judgment of God in 
death or in distress of conscience because of his sin, 
which is revealed and increased by the law, then, lest he 
despair, a mediator must come who will say: You, sinner, 
shall nevertheless remain, that is, you shall not die, even 
though the law and its wrath remain. 

501 This mediator is Jesus Christ, who does not 
change the voice of the law, as Moses does, nor cover it 
with a blanket, nor make me see the law no more, but 
opposes the wrath of the law, takes it away, and satisfies 
the law in his body by himself, and then by the gospel. 





says to me: "The law threatens you with the wrath of God 
and eternal death, but do not be dismayed and flee, but 
stand still; | will stand in your place and do enough for 
you according to the law. 

This is a far different mediator than Moses, who 
mediates between the angry God and the sinner. Here 
the mediation of Moses is of no use, because he has 
already disappeared and has aligned his office with his 
blanket. 

But there, a desperate sinner or a dying man and the 
offended and angry God meet head-on. Therefore, a 
mediator other than Moses must come to satisfy the law, 
take away its wrath and reconcile this lost sinner, who is 
guilty of eternal death, with the angry God. 

Paul remembers this mediator only in passing, since 
he says: "A mediator is not a mediator of one", because 
the name of a mediator actually denotes the one who 
acts as a mediator between an insulted and an insulter. 
We are the offenders, God with His law is the offended, 
and the offense is such that God cannot forgive it, nor 
are we able to do enough for it. Therefore, between God, 
who is unanimous in Himself, and us, there is the 
greatest disagreement. Moreover, God cannot revoke 
His law, but wants it to be kept, and we, who have 
transgressed the law of God, cannot flee from the 
presence of God. So Christ placed Himself as mediator 
between these two, which are completely different and 
separated from each other by an infinite and eternal gulf, 
and reconciled them to each other 2c. In what way? "He 
hath," as Paul elsewhere [Col. 2:14, 15] says, "cut off the 
handwriting that was against us, which was made by 
statutes (that is, the law), and was contrary to us; and 
hath put it out of the way, and nailed it to the cross; and 
hath taken off principalities and powers, and made a 
public display of them, and made a triumph of them by 
himself." Therefore, he is not the mediator of one, but of 
two, who were in strongest disagreement with each 
other.

Seed desire bear. This is the short epitome of the reason 
of proof that Paul took from the word "mediator" in his 
digression. 


But God is united. 


God offends no one, therefore he needs no mediator; 
but we offend God, therefore we need a mediator, not 
Moses, but Christ, who speaks for our good 2c. - This is 
how far the digression goes [cf. § 478], now Paul returns 
to the matter at hand. 


V. 21. How is the law contrary to God's promises? 


Above [v. 11] Paul said that the law does not justify. 
Should we therefore do away with it? No, because it also 
has its use. Which one? It brings people to self- 
knowledge, shows and increases sin 2c. Here another 
question immediately arises. If the law only makes 
people worse by showing them sin, does it not conflict 
with God's promises, and does God not seem to be 
irritated and offended by the law, so that he cannot keep 
and fulfill his promises? We Jews have thought just the 
opposite, namely that we are kept and determined by the 
law in an outward discipline, so that God, moved by it, 
hastened the fulfillment of the promise, and so that 
through this discipline we earned the promise. 

513. Paul answers: "No; yes, on the contrary, if you 
look at the law, the promise is only hindered more. For 
human reason offends God, who makes the promise, 
since it does not want to hear his good and holy law. For 
it says: "Do not let the Lord speak to us" 2c. Should God 
then keep His promises to these people who not only do 
not receive the law and its discipline, but hate and flee 
from the bottom of their hearts? Here, then, as | have 
said, this question immediately arises: Does not the law 
seem to hinder God's promises? Paul touches on this 
question even casually and passes over it, but he 
answers it shortly by saying: 


6 "I. Il, 90-92. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2292-2295. 





435 


Let that be far away! 

514 Why then? First, because God did not give the 
promise for the sake of our worthiness, merit or good 
works, but out of pure abundant:: and everlasting 
goodness and mercy. He does not say to Abraham, 
Because thou hast kept the law, therefore in thee shall 
all nations be blessed; but because he was yet 
uncircumcised, and had not the law, and was yet an 
idolater (as Joshua 24:2. is written), he says to him [Gen. 
12:1.], Go out of thy father's country 2c. [Cap. 15, 1.:] "I 
am your shield" 2c. Likewise [Cap. 22, 18.]: "Through 
your seed" 2c. These promises are completely 


unconditional (absolutae), which God promises to 
Abraham for free, without any condition or consideration 
of previous or subsequent works or merits. 

515 This is very much against the Jews, who think 
that the divine promises are hindered by their sins. God, 
says Paul, does not postpone His promises because of 
our sins, nor does He hasten them because of our 
righteousness and merits; He does not consider either of 
them. Therefore, even though we become more angry 
and hate God more because of the law, God is not 
moved by it to postpone His promise, because it is not 
based on our worthiness and righteousness, but on His 
goodness and mercy. 

Therefore, it is a mere fiction when the Jews say: 
Messiah does not come because our sins echo his 
coming; as if God becomes unjust for the sake of our sins 
or a liar for the sake of our lies. He remains always just 
and true, may we be sinners or righteous. Thus, His truth 
alone is the reason why He keeps and fulfills His 
promise. 

517. Then, although the law reveals and increases 
sin, it is not contrary to the promises of God; rather, it is 
for them. For if it does its work rightly and perfectly and 
achieves its purpose, it humbles man and prepares him 
(if he only uses the law rightly) to desire and seek grace. 
For only then, when man is shown his sin through the law 


436 Li-l. ttai. Il, 92-94. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 3, 21. W. VIII, 229S-2298. 


437 





If he sees that the law is not only good but also 
blasphemous, he sees in truth the ungodliness and 
enmity of the human heart against the law and God, the 
author of the law. Then he seriously feels that he not only 
does not love the supremely good God with His 
completely holy law, but also hates and blasphemes 
Him. Here he must confess that there is absolutely 
nothing good in him, and when he has been so crushed 
and humiliated by the law, he recognizes that he is in 
truth wretched and damned. So when the law forces him 
to acknowledge his wickedness in such a way and to 
confess his sin from the heart, it has finished its work and 
its time is over, the time of grace has come, so that the 
blessed seed can come, so that it can again straighten 
out the man who has been frightened and crushed by the 
law and comfort him with the gospel. 

518. In this way, the Law is not contrary to the 
promises of God, because, first, the promise is not based 
on the Law, but on God's truth; second, because the Law 
humbles in the best and highest use, and by humbling, 
causes men to sigh, desire, and seek the hand of the 
Mediator, whose grace and mercy make it very sweet (as 
it is said in the 109th Psalm, v. 21: "Thy grace is my 
consolation"), and makes His gift delicious and 
inexpressible, and so enables us to receive Christ. 
Psalm, v. 21: "Thy grace is my consolation") and makes 
his gift delicious and inexpressible, and thus enables us 
to receive Christ (Christi capaces reddit). For sweet 
things do not taste good to him who has not tasted bitter 
things. Hunger is the best cook. Just as a dry land thirsts 
for rain, so the law makes frightened hearts thirst for 
Christ. Christ tastes this most delightfully; there is joy, 
comfort and life. Only then will Christ and His good deeds 
be truly recognized. 

519 This use of the law is therefore very good, that it 
may be so well used as to make humble and thirsty after 
Christ. For he wants to have thirsty souls, which he 
beckons to him in the most delightful way, saying [Matth. 
11, 28]: "Come to me, all you who are weary and 
burdened, and | will give you rest. Therefore he gladly 
waters and moistens this arid land. He pours not fine 
waters upon a fat, sated, and 





not thirsty land. His goods are priceless, therefore he 
gives them only to the needy, preaches the gospel to the 
poor, waters the thirsty. "Whosoever thirsteth (saith he 
Joh. 7, 37.), let him come unto me, and drink." "He heals 
the brokenhearted" 2c. [Ps. 147, 3.], that is, those who 
are afflicted and martyred by the law he comforts and 
makes blessed. Therefore, the law is not against the 
promises of God. 


But if there were a law that could give life, then 
righteousness would truly come from the law. 


‘With these words Paul shows that no law can make 
alive, but only kill. So my works, which | do not only 
according to the laws of the priest or human statutes, but 
also according to the law of God, do not make me 
righteous before God, but present me as a sinner; they 
do not propitiate the wrath of God, but provoke it; they 
do not obtain righteousness, but take it away; they do 
not make me alive, but kill me. Therefore, since he says, 
"If a law were given," 2c., he teaches in the clearest 
terms that not even the divine law can make alive, but 
has just the opposite effect. 

521 Although these words of Paul are quite clear, they 
are completely obscure and unknown to the papists. For 
if they understood them, they would not praise so much 
the free will, the human powers, the keeping of the 
(evangelical) counsels, the super-long works 2c. But lest 
it be publicly seen that they are ungodly men and 
heathen, who brazenly deny the words of the apostle of 
Christ, they constantly seek to nullify with this 
exceedingly pernicious gloss such passages in Paul as 
speak of the law which bespeaks sin and incurs wrath, 
that is, of the holy ten commandments. 


1) This paragraph is used by Aurifaber (in the translation of 
Menius) for § 33 of the 12th chapter of the Table Talks. In our edition

2) Thus Luther calls the opera supererogationis in the 
interpretation of the 8th chapter of John, in our edition vol. VIII, 182, 
§ 123, and in the interpretation of the 16th chapter of John, ibid. col. 
635, § 59. 


438 Lri. Gai. Il, 94*-96. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2298-2302. 


Paul is talking about the ceremonial law, not the moral 
law. 

522 But Paul speaks actually and clearly, since he 
says: "If a law would be given" 2c., and does not exclude 
any law at all. Therefore, the gloss of the sophists is 
useless. For the ceremonial laws were commanded by 
God and kept just as strictly as the moral laws; the Jews 
kept circumcision just as conscientiously as the 
Sabbath. Therefore the apostle speaks of the whole law. 

523 These words of Paul are sung and read in all 
churches, and yet they are taught and lived in the 
opposite way. Paul says that no law is given to make 
alive. On the other hand, the Sophists teach the exact 
opposite and claim that many and innumerable laws are 
given to make alive. Although they do not say this in 
clear words, this is in fact their opinion, and this testifies 
brightly enough to their monasticism, to the innumerable 
human laws, statutes, and ceremonies, to the works and 


merits according to equity and dignity (congrui et 


condigni), and to countless other ungodly services 
which they have established. These alone they 
preached after the gospel had been suppressed, 
promising for certain that those who held such services 
would obtain grace, forgiveness of sins, and eternal life. 
This, | say, cannot be denied, for their books still exist, 
which bear quite certain witness to this. 

(524) On the other hand, we teach with Paul that no 
law, whether human or divine, makes righteousness and 
life, and therefore we distinguish the law from 
righteousness as far as death from life, hell from heaven. 
And to this doctrine we are moved by this clear passage 
of Paul: 1) The law was not given to make righteous, 
alive and blessed, but rather to condemn, kill and 
destroy, contrary to the opinion of all men. 


1) What now follows up to the end of § 526 is used by Aurifaber 
(excerpted from the translation of Menius) for the first half of § 34 of 
the 12th chapter of the Table Talks. In our edition of the Table Talks, 
this section is omitted. 





439 


Those who by nature judge that the law was given to 
obtain righteousness, life and salvation. 

525 This actual difference between the offices of the 
Law and the Gospel keeps the entire pure theology in its 
proper use, also makes the faithful judges over all 


classes (vitae genera), over all laws and doctrines 


(dogmata) Of all men, and also gives them the ability to 
test all spirits. 

The papists, on the other hand, because they have 
completely mixed and confused the doctrine of the Law 
and the Gospel, cannot teach anything certain, neither 
of faith nor of works, neither of classes nor of the 
difference of spirits. The same is the case today with the 
spirits of the swarms 2c. 

527 After these refutations and proofs Paul teaches 
in detail and beautifully that the law is nothing else, if one 
has its right, and indeed the best use in mind, than a kind 


of child education (paedagogiam) to righteousness. For 
it humbles men and makes them able to receive the 
righteousness of Christ when it does its proper work, that 
is, when it makes them guilty, terrifies them, brings them 
to the knowledge of sin, wrath, death, hell. For when this 
has happened, the delusion of their own righteousness 
and holiness fades away, and Christ with his benefits 
begins to become sweet. Therefore, the law is not 
against the promises of God, but rather for them. It does 
not fulfill the promise, nor does it bring righteousness, 
but it humbles us by its office and custom, and thus 
makes us thirsty for the grace and benefits of Christ, and 
able to receive them. 

Therefore he says: If there were any law that could 
bring righteousness and through it life, since no one can 
obtain life unless he is first righteous, then righteousness 
would truly come from the law; likewise, if there were any 
state, work, order, or service that could bring about the 
forgiveness of sins, righteousness, and life, then these 
would truly make one righteous and alive. But this is 
impossible, because: 


Vv. 22. The Scriptures have decreed it all 
under sin. 


440 


Li-1. 6ai. Il, p. 6-99. Explanation of Galatians 3, 22. W. VIII, 2302-2308. 


441 





Where? First of all, in the promises of Christ, such as 
Genesis 3:15: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the 
serpent's head," and Genesis 22:18: "Through your 
seed," 2c. Therefore, wherever in the Scriptures the 
promise of Christ is made to the fathers, the blessing is 
promised, that is, righteousness, blessedness and 


eternal life. So by the contrast (per contrarium) it is 
proved that those who are to be blessed are subject to 
the curse, that is, to sin and eternal death; otherwise why 
would it be necessary to promise the blessing? 

530] Secondly, the Scriptures, especially through the 
law itself, resolve men under sin and the curse, since its 
true function is to reveal sin, to cause wrath 2c., which 
we have indicated throughout the epistle, but especially 
from this saying of Paul [Gal. 3, 10]: "Those who deal 
with the works of the law are under the curse"; likewise 
from the saying that Paul quoted from the 5th book of 
Moses, Cap. 27, 26: "Cursed be every one that 
continueth not in all these things. "2c. For these sayings, 
in no uncertain terms, bring under the sin and the curse 
not only those who publicly sin against the law or do not 
do it outwardly, but also those who are under the law and 
strive with all their might to keep the law, as the Jews 
did, of which | have spoken above. 

531 This passage much more concludes under sin all 
monks, hermits, Carthusians with their most holy (as 
they dream, because they pretend that if someone had 
taken his religious vows only a short time before and 
then died, he would immediately fly to heaven) vows and 
services. For here you hear most clearly that Scripture 
concludes everything under sin. So neither the vow nor 
the highest spirituality (religio) of a Carthusian is a 
righteousness, but everything is condemned. By what? 
By the scripture. Which scripture? First, by this promise: 
"The seed of the woman," 2c. "In thee shall be blessed" 
2c., and similar passages; then also by the whole law, 
whose proper office is that it cast under sin 2c. So do not 
trample monks, 





no Carthusians, no Celestines, the head of the serpent, 
but they remain trampled under the head of the serpent, 
that is, under the power of the devil. But who believes 
this? 

‘In short, everything that is outside of Christ and his 
promises is decided under sin without exception, 
whether it be divine or human law, ceremonial or moral 
law. For "the Scriptures have decreed all things under 
sin"; but he who says "all things" excludes nothing. So 
we conclude with Paul that all worldly ordinances 


(politiae) and laws of all Gentiles, however good and 
necessary they are, that all divine services and human 
holiness (religiones) without faith in Christ are and 
remain under sin, under death and eternal damnation, 
unless, as soon follows, the promise follows through 
faith in Christ Jesus. This has been discussed in more 
detail above. 

533 Therefore this sentence is true: faith alone 
justifies, which the adversaries cannot suffer in any way, 
because Paul concludes here most strongly that the law 
does not make alive, because it was not given for this 
purpose. If this does not make righteous and alive, then 
works make much less righteous. For this is what Paul 
wants to infer when he says that the law does not make 
alive, namely, that works do not make alive either, for it 
says more strongly: The law does not make alive than: 
Works do not make alive. 

534 If therefore the law, though it be fulfilled (though 
it be impossible that it should be fulfilled), justifieth not, 
much less do the works themselves. So faith alone 
justifies, without works. For Paul does not suffer this 
addition: faith with works justifies, but he speaks Rom. 
3, 20. and above Cap. 2, 16. ina negative way by saying: 
"By the works of the law no flesh is justified", and here: 
"The law was not given to make alive."

That the promise might come through faith in 
Jesus Christ. 

535 Above he said that the Scripture had decided 
everything under sin. For eternity? No, but until the 
promise comes. The promise, however, is the inheritance 
itself, or the blessing promised to Abraham, that is, 
deliverance from the law, sin, death and the devil, and 
the bestowal of grace, righteousness, blessedness and 
eternal life. That promise, he says, is obtained by no 
merit, no law, no works, but is given. To whom? To those 
who believe. In whom? In Jesus Christ, who is the 
blessed seed that redeemed those who believe from the 
curse, so that they might receive the blessing. 

These words are not obscure, but exceedingly clear. 
However, one must take care to pay diligent attention to 
them, and we must consider their meaning and power 


(pondus) carefully. For if all things are determined under 
sin, it follows that all nations are cursed and lack the glory 
they should have in God [Rom. 3:23], likewise that they 
are under God's wrath and the devil's dominion, and that 
no one can be delivered from it by anything else but faith 
in Christ. Paul, therefore, with these words most strongly 
contends against the enthusiastic opinions which the 
sophists and all works saints have of the righteousness 
of the law and of works, since he says: "That the promise 
might come through faith in JESUS Christ, given to them 
that believe." 

(537) How to answer the sayings concerning works 
and wages, | have indicated above in sufficient detail, 
and the matter does not require us to speak of works 
now, because we have not here taken the trade of works 
before us, but of justification, namely, that it is not 
obtained by the law or by works, since everything is 
under sin and the curse, but by faith in Christ. 

But where it is not a matter of justification, no one can 
praise highly enough the good works that God has 
commanded. For who can estimate the benefit and fruit 
of even one work that a Christian does? 





443 


by faith and in faith, praise enough ? For it is more 
precious than heaven and earth. Therefore, the whole 
world in this life cannot give the due reward even for such 
a good work, nor does the world have the grace to 
appreciate the good works of the godly, much less to 
reward them, because it does not see them, or if it sees 
them, it judges that they are not good works, but the 


worst evil deeds, and seeks to eliminate (exturbate) 
those who do such works as the most harmful pest for 
the human race. 

539 Thus Christ, the Savior of the world, was put to 
the most ignominious death on the cross for his 
exceedingly great and unspeakable good deeds. 
Similarly, the apostles, who brought to the world the word 
of grace and eternal life, became a curse of the world 
and a sacrifice of the people. Truly a worthy reward that 
the world has paid for such great good deeds. 

540. But the works that are done apart from faith, 
however holy they may appear to be, are under sin and 
the curse; therefore, far from those who do them 
deserving grace, righteousness, and eternal life, they 
rather heap sin upon sin. In this way the pope does 
works, the man of sin and the child of perdition, and all 
who follow him. In this way, all works saints and heretics 
who have fallen from the faith do their works. 


V. 23: But before faith came. 


541 He continues to make clear the usefulness and 
necessity of the law. Above [v. 19] he said that it came 
about for the sake of sins, not as if this was the main 
intention of God, that he only gave the law to bring death 
and condemnation, as he also says in Rom. 7, 13: "Has 
that which is good become death to me? Be it far from 
me!" For the law is a word that shows life and leads to it; 
therefore it is not given for death alone. But this is its 
main use and purpose, that it reveals death, so that on 


444 Dri. ttai. Il, 101-104. Explanation of Galatians 3, 23, W. VIII, 2309-2312. 


445 





In this way, the nature and magnitude of sin is made 
known. But it does not reveal death in such a way that it 
delights in it, or seeks nothing else than to kill us, but for 
the sake of it, so that the frightened and humbled people 
fear God; and this is also clearly indicated by the text 2 
Mos. 20, 20, where Moses says: "Do not be afraid, for 
God has come to tempt you, and that His fear may be 
before your eyes, so that you do not sin. 

The function of the law is therefore only to kill, but in 
such a way that God can make alive. Therefore, the law 
is not given to death per se, but because man is arrogant 
and dreams that he is wise, just and holy, it is necessary 
that he be humbled by the law, so that this beast, the 
delusion of his own righteousness, may be killed; if it is 
not killed, man cannot live. 

Thus, although the law kills, God uses this effect of 
the law, that is, this death, for a good use, namely for 
life. For since God saw that this general destruction of 


the entire human race (orbis terrarum) could not 
otherwise be resisted, and that the delusion of one's own 
righteousness or hypocrisy and the trust in one's own 


holiness could not otherwise be put to an end (conteri), 
he wanted this delusion to be killed by the law, but not in 
such a way that man would remain eternally in death, 
but that man, after the delusion has been killed, would 
again align himself, and he would also hear this voice 
over the law: "Fear not!" | did not give the law and kill 
you with it so that you would remain in death, but so that 
you would fear me and live. For presumption, which is 
based on good works and one's own righteousness, 
does not allow one to fear God. But where there is no 
fear of God, there can be no thirst for grace and life. 

544. therefore God must have a strong hammer to break 
the rocks, and a fire that burns to the midst of heaven 
[Deut. 4:11] to turn the mountains, that is, to bring down 


that stubborn (obstipam) 
presumption. 


and — unruly beast, 





to smite, so that man, having been reduced to nothing by 
this smashing, may despair of his powers, his 
righteousness and his works, and be terrified before 
God, and in such terror thirst for mercy and forgiveness 
of sins. 


But before faith came, we were kept and shut up 
under the law. 


545 That is, before the time of the gospel and grace 
came, this was the ministry of the law, that we should be 
shut up and kept under it, as in a prison. 

This is a very beautiful and extremely appropriate 
simile, which shows what the law accomplishes and how 
righteous it makes people. Therefore, it must be 
considered very carefully. No thief, murderer, robber, 
2c., who is a prisoner, loves the fetters and the hideous 
dungeon in which he is kept bound. Yes, if he could, he 
would destroy the dungeon together with the iron bands 
and turn it to ashes. In the dungeon he abstains from 
wrongdoing, but not out of good will or love of justice, but 
because the dungeon hinders him. And now that he is 
imprisoned, he does not detest and hate his sin and 
thievery (yes, he is heartily sorry that he is not free and 
cannot steal), but he hates his prison; if he could go out 
of it, he would steal as before. 


The law keeps people civil and spiritual 
(theologice). 

The law and justice from the law also have such an 
effect (vis), which forces us to be outwardly good, since 
it threatens the transgressors with corporal and life 
punishment. We obey the law out of fear of punishment, 
but unwillingly and with the greatest reluctance. But what 
kind of righteousness is it when you are forced to refrain 
from doing evil out of fear of punishment? Therefore, this 
righteousness of works is really nothing other than loving 
sin, hating righteousness, abhorring God with His law, 
and worshipping the highest wickedness. For as much 
as a thief may keep his dungeon 


446 Kai. Il, 104-106. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2312-2315. 


447 





If we love the law and hate theft, we will gladly obey it 
and do what it commands and refrain from doing what it 
forbids. 

In the meantime, the law has this benefit, however 
ungodly the hearts may remain, that it first of all keeps 
thieves, murderers and publicly ungodly people in check 
to some extent, externally and civilly. For if these did not 
have the admittedly small faith that sin in the world would 
be punished with the wheel, the cross, the sword, and 
after this life with eternal death and hell, then no 
authority, no householder or  disciplinarian 
(paedagogus) could restrain the rage of men with any 
force, with any laws or bonds. But by the threats of the 
law, which instill terror in the minds, the wicked are 
deterred to some extent, so that they do not suddenly 
plunge into all kinds of outrages. In the meantime, they 
would rather have no law, no punishment, no hell, and 
even no God. If God had no hell and did not punish the 
wicked, then everyone would love and praise Him. But 
because He punishes the wicked, and all are wicked, 
therefore, if they are closed under the law, they must, 
and it cannot be otherwise, hate God and blaspheme to 
the utmost. 

Secondly, the law closes people not only in a civil but 
also in a spiritual way, that is, the law is also a spiritual 
dungeon and in truth a hell, because when it reveals sin, 
threatens death and the eternal wrath of God, man 
cannot escape, nor can he find comfort. For it is not in 
the power of man to shake off this terrible horror which 
the law brings about, or any other sadness of heart. 
Hence come the miserable words and lamentations of 
the saints everywhere in the Psalms [Ps. 6:6.), "Who will 
thank thee in hell?" 2c. For man is then locked in the 
dungeon, from which he cannot come out, nor does he 
see how he can be released from these bonds, that is, 
freed from this terror. 

550 Thus the law is a civil and a spiritual prison. For 
first, in its civil use, it hinders and shuts up the wicked, 
so that they cannot without fear 





(praecipites) can commit all deeds of shame according 
to their desires. Secondly, it shows us spiritually the sin, 
frightens and humbles us, so that we, thus frightened, 
recognize our misery and our damnation. And this is the 
right and proper use of the law, only it should not last 
permanently, because this locking up and keeping under 
the law should not last longer than until the future faith; 
when that has come, then this spiritual imprisonment 
should cease. 

Here we see again that the law and the gospel, which 
are widely separated from each other, and are more 
separated from each other than such things as are totally 


contradictory (contradictoria, e.g. fire and water 2c.), 
are very close to each other in heart 1). Such Paul 
indicates by saying, "We were kept under the law, and 
shut up unto the faith to come." Therefore it is not 
enough that we are shut up under the law, for if nothing 
else followed we would have to despair, die in our sins 
2c., but Paul adds that we are shut up and kept under 
restraint under the disciplinarian (the law), not for 
eternity, but unto Christ, who is the end of the law. 

Therefore, this being terrified, this humiliation and 
being kept under the law should not last forever, but only 
until the future faith, that is, for our salvation and for our 
good, so that when we are terrified by the law, grace, the 
forgiveness of sins, deliverance from the law, sin, death 
2c. may become sweet to us, all of which cannot be 
received by works, but is taken by faith alone 2c. 

553 Whoever then knows how to combine these 
things, which are utterly opposed to each other, in the 
challenge, that is, whoever then, when he is frightened 
to the utmost by the law, knows that the end of the law 
and the beginning of grace or of the faith to come are 
present, uses the law rightly. 

554. all the wicked understand this art 


1) This statement seems to contradict what was said at the end 
of § 471. However, the contradiction is only apparent and must be put 
right according to § 553, but especially according to § 558. Compare 
also § 420.

449 





not. Cain did not know about it when he, locked in the 
dungeon of the Law, felt his sin seriously. At first he was 
outside the prison, that is, he felt no terror, even since 
he had already committed the fratricide, but he 
pretended tremendously and thought that even God 
Himself knew nothing about it. He said [Gen. 4:9], "Shall 
| be my brother's keeper?" But when he heard the word, 
"What have you done? The voice of thy brother's blood 
crieth unto me from the earth," 2c. then began he to feel 
this prison earnestly. What was he doing here? He 
remained locked in the dungeon, he did not connect the 
gospel with the law, but said [v. 13]: "My sin is greater 
than this, that it may be forgiven me." He looked at the 
prison alone, but did not pay attention to the fact that the 
sin was revealed to him for his own sake, so that he 
might seek mercy from God. Therefore, he despaired 
and said that he had no God. He did not believe that he 
was closed to grace and faith, but was under the law. 
555 But these words, "to be kept and shut up under 
the law," are not idle words, which serve only for mental 


(speculabilia seu 


sophisticay, but true and serious ones. For this prison 
or dungeon means right and spiritual terror, by which the 
conscience is so closed that it cannot find a place in the 
whole world where it would like to be safe. Indeed, as 
long as this terror lasts, the conscience feels such great 
fear that it thinks that heaven and earth, even if they 
were ten times larger, are narrower than a mouse hole. 
Then man is completely stripped of all wisdom, 
abandoned by all powers, all justice, counsel and help. 
For the conscience is an exceedingly tender thing, 
therefore, when it is thus closed up by the dungeon of 
the law, there is nowhere open for it to escape, but it 
seems to it that this distress is continually increased ad 
infinitum. For then he feels the wrath of God, which is 
infinite, whose hand he cannot escape, as the 139th 
Psalm, v. 7, says: "Where shall | go before thy spirit?" 
2c. 

556) Just as the lock-up or the dungeon is a plague 
of the body in civil terms, 


games or school quarrels 


by which the shut-in is deprived of the use of his body, 
so spiritually the dungeon is the anguish and anguish of 
the heart, by which the shut-in is deprived of peace in the 
conscience and tranquility in the heart, yet not forever, 
as reason judges when it feels this dungeon, but to the 
future faith. Therefore, a mind that is closed under the 
law must be comforted in this way: Dear brother, you are 
indeed shut up, but you should know that this does not 
happen so that you are kept shut up in this dungeon 
forever, because it is written that we are shut up to the 
faith to come. Thou shalt not therefore be afflicted with 
this prison unto thy destruction, but that thou mayest be 
refreshed through the seed wherein the blessing is given; 
thou shalt be put to death by the law, that thou mayest 
be made alive by Christ. 

Therefore do not despair like Cain, Saul and Judas, 
who, being shut up in this prison, added nothing else, but 
remained in this prison, and therefore despaired. You 
must keep yourself in this terror of conscience differently 
from them, namely, that you know that it has happened 
to you for the best that you are thus shut up and put to 
shame; [do not despair] but see to it that you use this 
prison rightly, namely, on the future faith. For God does 
not want you to be put in fear so that you remain in this 
fear; He does not want to kill you so that you remain in 
death. He says through the prophet Ezekiel [Cap. 33, 
11]: "| have no pleasure in the death of the sinner," 2c., 
but He wants you to fall into fear, so that you may be 
humbled and realize that you are in need of God's mercy 
and Christ's good deeds. 

Therefore this custody under the law must not be 
eternal, but only last until faith, as also this exceedingly 
lovely saying in the 147th Psalm [v. 11] teaches: "The 
Lord is pleased with those who fear him," that is, who are 
decided under this custody of the law, but he immediately 
adds: "Who wait for his goodness. These two oppose 
each other- 


450 2ri- Gai. Il, 108-111. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2318-2321. 


451 





These two things must therefore be connected, even 
though they are quite different in substance. For what is 
more contrary to each other than to fear and detest the 
wrath of God and yet hope in his goodness? The one is 
hell, the other heaven, and yet they must be closely 
connected in the heart. It is very easy to bring them 


together in thought (speculative), but to bring them 


together in practice (practical) is the most difficult thing 
that | have often experienced. The papists and the 
founders of sects know nothing at all about this. 
Therefore, when they hear or read Paul's words, they 
are completely dark and incomprehensible to them, and 
when the law shows them sin, accuses them and 
frightens them, they find neither advice nor help, but 
despair like Cain and Saul. 

559 Since the law, as | have said, is our tormentor 
and prisoner, it is certain that we do not love it, but hate 
it intensely. Therefore, whoever says he loves the law is 
lying and does not know what he is saying. For a thief or 
robber who loved his dungeon and bonds would be 
senseless and mad. But since the law, as | have said, 
shuts us up, it is certain that we are its bitterest enemies. 
In short, we love 1) the law and its righteousness as 
much as a murderer loves the dungeon. How then 
should we be justified by the law? 


Closed to the faith that was to be revealed. 


This is what Paul says about the time of fulfillment 
when Christ came. But apply this not only to that time, 
but also to your heart; for what happened historically and 
at the time when Christ came and abolished the law and 
brought freedom and eternal life to light, this happens 
especially (privately) daily in a spiritual way in every 
Christian, in whom the time of the law and the time of 
grace are found alternately. For the Christian has a body 
in the members of which, as Paul says, sin is at war 
(militat). By sin, however, | do not understand only that 
which is put into action by the deed, but the root and the 
tree with its fruits, 


1) Wittenberger: amans instead of: amamus. 


as the Scripture is wont to speak of sin. It not only 
attaches itself to the flesh of those who are Christians 
and baptized, but also contends with them and takes the 
flesh captive; even if it does not cause them to consent 
to sin or to put it into practice, it nevertheless makes 
strong attempts and provokes them. 

For although a Christian does not fall into such gross 
sins as murder, adultery, theft 2c., he is not free from 
impatience, grumbling, hatred, blasphemy 2c. against 
God. These sins are completely unknown to human 
reason. These sins force a man, even against his will, to 
detest the law, they force him to flee from the face of 
God, they force him to hate and blaspheme against God. 
For just as in a young body lust is strong, in a man the 
desire for honor and wealth, in old age avarice, so ina 
holy man impatience, grumbling, hatred and blasphemy 
against God are strong. There are many examples of 
this everywhere in the Psalms, Job, Jeremiah and in all 
of Scripture. That is why Paul, in describing this spiritual 
battle, uses very emphatic and _ significant words, 
namely: to contend, to resist and to take captive. 

562 Thus, in a Christian, both the time of the law and 
the time of grace are in the heart. 2) The time of the law 
is when the law drives me, troubles me, makes me sad, 
and brings me to the knowledge of sin and increases it. 
Then the law is in its right use, which a Christian feels 
continuously as long as he lives. Thus Paul was given a 
stake in the flesh, namely Satan's angel, who beat him 
with fists. He would have liked to have joy in his 


conscience, a happy heart and the bliss (gustum) of 
eternal life at every moment, and would also have liked 
to be free of all fear of the heart, and therefore wished 
that this temptation would be taken away from him. But 
this does not happen, but he must hear from the Lord [2 
Cor. 12:9.], "Be satisfied with my grace, for my power is 
mighty in the weak." 

Every Christian experiences the same struggle. 
There are many hours in which | struggle with God. 


2) Wittenberger: "Leetu instead of: aMetu.

453 





and impatiently resist Him. | dislike the wrath and 
judgment of God. On the other hand, he dislikes my 
impatience, my grumbling, 2c. and this is the time of the 
law, under which the Christian, according to the flesh, is 
always. For the flesh lusteth continually against the 
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; but in the one 
more, in the other less. 

The time of grace is when the heart is restored by the 
promise of God's mercy through grace, and says [Ps. 
42:6]: "Why do you grieve, my soul, and are so troubled 
within me? Seest thou then nothing but the law, sin, 
terror, sorrow, despair, death, hell, and the devil? Is 
there not also grace, forgiveness of sins, righteousness, 
comfort, joy, peace, life, heaven, Christ, God? Stop, my 
soul, being restless within me. What is the law, sin and 
all evil in comparison? Hope in God, who did not spare 
His own Son, but gave Him to die on the Cross for your 
sins. 

565 This then is to be shut up under the law 
according to the flesh, not for ever, but unto Christ to 
come. Therefore, if thou art terrified by the law, say, 
Woman law, thou art not alone, neither art thou all; but 
apart from thee there is something greater and better, 
namely, grace, faith, blessing 2c. These do not accuse, 
frighten or condemn me, but comfort me, tell me to take 
care of everything good, and promise me certain victory 
and blessedness in Christ. Therefore, there is no reason 
for me to despair. 

He who understands this art well would rightly be 
called a theologian. The enthusiasts of today, who 
constantly boast of the spirit, and their disciples think 
that they can do this very well. | and my kind, however, 
have hardly the first rudiments of this art, but are diligent 
students in the school where this art is learned. One 
learns, but as long as the flesh and sin remain, this 
cannot be learned. 

567 Thus a Christian is divided between two times. 
If he is flesh, he is under the law; if he is spirit, he is 
under the law. 


Grace. The flesh is always affected by evil desire, 
avarice, ambition, arrogance 2c.; it is affected by 
ignorance and contempt of God, impatience, grumbling 
and anger against God, that he hinders our plans and 
noble deeds, that he does not punish the wicked and 
despisers immediately 2c. Such sins cling to the flesh of 
the saints. Therefore, if you look to nothing but the flesh, 
you will remain continually under the time of the law. But 
these days must be shortened, otherwise no flesh would 
be saved. The end of the law must be prescribed, since 
it must cease. Therefore the time of the law is not 
eternal, but has an end, which is Christ. But the time of 
grace is eternal, because Christ, having died once, dies 
no more. 2c. [He is eternal, therefore also the time of 
grace is eternal. 

568 We do not have to run drowsily over such 
wonderful sayings in Paul's writings, as the papists and 
the masters of the rot are wont to do. For they contain 
words of life that wonderfully comfort and strengthen the 
afflicted conscience, and those who hold them 
righteously can judge correctly what is faith, what is right 
and what is wrong fear, likewise they can judge 
everything that men do according to their own 
inclination, and are able to distinguish all spirits. The fear 
of God is something holy and delicious, but it should not 
be eternal. It must always be there in every Christian, 
because there is always sin in him, but it must not be 
fine alone, otherwise it is the fear of Cain, Saul and 
Judas, that is, a servile fear that leads to despair. 

Therefore, a Christian, believing in the word of grace, 
must overcome fear, turn away his eyes from the time of 
the law and look only to Christ and the faith to come. 
Then fear becomes sweet, and is mixed with heavenly 


potion (nectare), so that man begins not only to fear 
God, but also to love Him. Otherwise, if man only looks 
at the law and sin, without faith, he cannot cast out fear, 
but will finally despair. 

570 Thus Paul beautifully distinguishes the time of 
the law and the time of grace. Also 


454 2ri. o-u. Il, 113-IIS. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2325-2328. 


455 





Let us learn to distinguish the time of the two properly, 
not with words, but from the heart, which is the most 
difficult thing. For although these two are very far from 
each other in the matter, yet they are very closely 
connected in one and the same heart. For nothing is 
more closely connected than fear and confidence, law 
and gospel, sin and grace. For they are so connected 
with each other that one consumes the other. Therefore, 
no mathematical connection can be found that is similar 
to this. 

From the passage [v. 19]: "What then is the law for?" 
Paul began to speak of the law, as well as of the use and 
abuse of the law, and thus had the occasion to claim that 
righteousness is granted to those who believe through 
grace and the promise, not through the law. This bargain 
brought about the question, "What then is the law for?" 
For when reason hears that righteousness or blessing is 
obtained through grace and the promise, it immediately 
concludes, "So the law is of no use. 

572 Therefore the doctrine of the law must be 
diligently considered as to what and how we are to think 
of the law, lest we either reject it altogether, as the 
enthusiasts did, who in 1525, when they stirred up the 
peasant revolt, said that evangelical liberty made men 
free from all laws; or lest we attribute to it the power that 
it can make righteous. For both sin against the law; on 
the right, those who want to be justified by the law, on 
the left, those who want to be entirely free from the law. 
We must therefore take the middle road, so that we 
neither reject the law altogether, nor attach to it more 
than is due. 

What | have often said above about the twofold use 
of the law, the secular and the spiritual, shows 
sufficiently that the law is not given to the righteous, but, 
as Paul teaches elsewhere [1 Tim. 1:9], to the 
unrighteous. Now there are two kinds of unrighteous, 
namely, those who desire to be righteous and those who 
do not. Those who do not desire to be righteous are 
made unrighteous by the civil custom of the law. 


law are kept in check. For they must be bound with the 
bands of the laws, just as cruel and wild beasts are 
bound with cords and chains. This custom never ends; 
Paul is not talking about it here. But those who desire to 
be justified are afflicted for a time by the spiritual custom 
of the law. For this custom does not last forever, as the 
civil one does, but is foreseen for the faith to come, and 
has its end when Christ comes. 

From this it is quite clear that all the sayings in which 
Paul speaks of the spiritual use of the law must be 
understood by those who desire to be justified, not by 
those who have already been justified. For the justified, 
if they remain in Christ, are far outside all laws and 
above them. Therefore the law must be laid down for 
those who desire to be justified, only so that they may 
be kept under it until the righteousness of faith comes, 
not that they should attain this righteousness through 
the law, for that would be to abuse the law, but not to 
use it rightly; but so that, frightened and humbled by the 
law, they may take refuge in Christ, who is the end of the 
law, for the righteousness of all those who believe in 
him. 

575 Therefore, first of all, all sanctimonious workers 
and hypocrites, who dream that men are justified by the 
law, abuse the law. For this custom does not drive and 
penetrate to the future faith, but makes full, sure and 
arrogant hypocrites, who boast and are presumptuous 
because of the righteousness and works of the law, and 
hinders the righteousness of faith. 

Secondly, the law is abused by those who want to 
completely disassociate the Christians from the law, as 
the enthusiasts did and therefore aroused the peasants' 
revolt. And nowadays many of our people do the same, 
who, redeemed from the tyranny of the papacy by the 
teaching of the Gospel, dream that Christian freedom is 
a carnal licentiousness to do anything. These, as Peter 
says [1 Ep. 2, 16], make spiritual liberty the cover of 
wickedness, so that today the name 


456 Li-i. oai. ii, iis-118. Explanation of Galatians 3, 23. 24. W. vin, 2328-2331. 


457 





God and the gospel of Christ is blaspohemed everywhere, 
and therefore they will have to suffer the deserved 
punishment of their godlessness. 

Thirdly, those who feel the terror of the law, but do 
not realize that it should last only until Christ, also abuse 
it. With these, abuse is the cause of despair, as with 
hypocrites it is the cause of pride and presumption. 

578 On the other hand, the right use of the law cannot 
be considered sufficiently exquisite, because the 
conscience, which is closed under the law, does not 
despair, but, instructed by the Holy Spirit, wisely thinks 
in the midst of terror: | am indeed closed under the law, 
but not forever; indeed, this closure will be for my good. 
In what way? That I, thus shut up, desire the hand of the 
helper and seek it 2c. 

579 In this way the law is as it were a driver that 
drives the hungry to Christ, that he may fill them with his 
goods. Therefore, the true function of the law is to make 
us guilty, to humiliate us, to kill us, to lead us to hell, and 
to take everything from us, but with the intention that we 
may be justified, exalted, made alive, led to heaven, and 
obtain everything. Therefore, do not merely kill, but kill to 
life. 


V. 24. So the law has been our disciplinarian on 
Christ. 


Again, he connects in his heart the law and the 
gospel, which are separated in the widest sense, since 
he says: "The law is our disciplinarian on Christ. But this 
simile of the disciplinarian is also an excellent one, 
therefore it must be considered carefully. 

Although a disciplinarian is very useful and necessary 
to educate and teach children, provide me with only one 
child, or one student, who loves his disciplinarian. Did the 
Jews love their Moses very much and gladly do what he 
commanded? Their love and obedience for Moses was 
such that, as history testifies, they were happy to punish 
him at any hour. 








nigt would have. Therefore, it is impossible for a disciple 
to love his disciplinarian. For how could he love him by 
whom he is kept in prison, that is, by whom he is not 
permitted to do what he would like to do? And if he sins 
(admittit) something against his orders, he is 
immediately scolded and chastised, and must also take 
the rod and kiss it. O, a splendid justice of the pupil, that 
he obeys the harsh and hard disciplinarian, that he 
kisses the rod! But he does not even do this willingly and 
gladly; if the disciplinarian is not there, he breaks the rod 
or throws it into the fire, and if he had power over the 
disciplinarian, he would not let himself be prodded by 
him with rods, but would order that he be prodded with 
rods. And yet a child is in great need of a disciplinarian 
to instruct him and discipline him. Otherwise, without this 
discipline, instruction and good habituation, the child 
would perish. 

582 Thus a child is given a disciplinarian to instruct 
and guard it, and to keep it imprisoned, as it were, ina 
dungeon. For what purpose and for how long? Is it so 
that this harsh and spiteful rule of the disciplinarian and 
the bondage of the child will last forever? Not at all, but 
until the predetermined time, so that this obedience, 
imprisonment and discipline may serve the child for the 
best, so that he may become heir and king in his time. 
For it is not the Father's will that his son should be forever 
subject to the disciplinarian and be struck with rods by 
him, but that through his instruction and discipline he 
should become fit to take up his inheritance. 

So the law is nothing else, Paul says, but a 
disciplinarian, not forever, but for Christ, as he also said 
above in other words [v. 19]: "The law came for sins, until 
the seed should come" 2c. Likewise [v. 22.], "The 
scripture hath decreed it all under sin, that the promise 
might come" 2c. Likewise [v. 23.], "We were kept under 
the law, and shut up unto the faith that should be 
revealed." Therefore the law is not a disciplinarian par 
excellence, but upon Christ. For what kind of a 
disciplinarian should it be, who only afflicted a child, and 


458 Ari- Kai. Il, 118-120. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2331-2335. 


and the same taught nothing? Such disciplinarians 
existed before that time, when the schools were really a 
dungeon and a hell, and the schoolmasters were tyrants 


and carnifices. They were constantly pushing the 
children; they learned with a lot of work and untiring 
diligence, but very few had any benefit from it. The law is 
not such a disciplinarian, for it not only frightens and 
torments, as an unteachable and foolish disciplinarian 
only prods and teaches the children nothing, but it drives 
them to Christ with its blows, as a good disciplinarian 
beats, teaches, and trains the children in reading and 
writing, with the intention that they come to know good 
sciences and other respectable things and later do with 
pleasure what they did unwillingly before, when they 
were forced under the disciplinarian. 

With this beautiful parable Paul shows the right use 
of the law, namely, that it does not make the hypocrites 
righteous, because they remain in presumption and 
security apart from Christ, and again, that it does not 
leave the frightened in death and condemnation when 
they use the law in this way, as Paul teaches, but drives 
them to Christ. But those who in such fear persist in their 
pusillanimity and do not take hold of Christ in faith must 
finally despair. 

585 Thus Paul clearly depicts the true custom of the 


law through this image (allegoria) of the disciplinarian. 
For just as he chides, drives and saddens children, not 
with the intention that this discipline should last forever, 
but that it should cease when the children have been 
properly brought up and instructed, and so that they may 
later enjoy freedom and paternal goods happily and 
freely without the restraint of the disciplinarian: so let 
those who are frightened and crushed by the law know 
that this fright and crushing will not be forever, but that 
they will thereby be prepared for the future Christ and 
spiritual freedom 2c. 


That we might be justified by faith. 


586 The law is a disciplinarian, not that it drives to 
another lawgiver who requires good works, but to Christ, 





459 


who justifies and saves, so that we may be justified by 
faith in him, not by works. But when man feels the power 
of the law, he does not understand and believe it. That is 
why he tends to say, "I have lived condemned, for | have 
transgressed all the commandments of God, and 
therefore | am guilty of eternal death. If God would add a 
few more years to my life, or at least a few more months, 
| would amend my life and then live holy. 

Man makes an abuse of the right use of the law, and, 
putting Christ out of sight, he looks around for another 
lawgiver. For reason, when seized in this terror and fear, 
dares to promise God the fulfillment of all the works of the 
whole law. And therefore so many sects of monks have 
arisen, So many services have been instituted, so many 
works have been devised to merit grace and forgiveness 
of sins, and those who devised this have been of the 
opinion that the law is not a disciplinarian on Christ, but 
on a new law or on Christ as the lawgiver, not on Christ 
as the end of the law. 

588 But the right use of the law is, that | may know 
that by the law | am brought to the knowledge of sin, and 
am humbled, that | may come to Christ, and be justified 
by faith. Now faith is not a law nor a work, but the certain 
confidence that takes hold of Christ, who is the end of the 
law, Rom. 10:4. In what way? Not that he abolishes the 
old law and brings a new one, or is a judge who must be 
reconciled by works, as the papists taught, but "he is the 
end of the law, he who believes in him is righteous," the 
law cannot accuse him 2c. This is the power and right 
custom of the law. Therefore it is good, holy, useful and 
necessary, if only it is used rightly. 

589. But the hypocrites abuse the law first, who 
ascribe to it the power to make righteous; then also those 
who despair, who do not know that the law is a 
disciplinarian of Christ, that is, do not know that the law 
humiliates, not to our destruction, but to salvation. 


460 Lii.oai. Il, 120-122. Explanation d. Galatians 3, 24. 25. 


W. VIII, 2335-2338. 461 





For God strikes that He may heal, He kills that He may 
make alive 2c. 

But Paul, as | have reminded you above, speaks of 
those who are to be justified, not of those who are 
already justified. Therefore, if you want to deal with the 
law, you must take such a person before you as the one 


with whom the law has to do (materiam legis), namely a 
sinner and ungodly man, whom the law does not make 
righteous, but puts sin before his eyes, breaks him down 
and brings him to self-knowledge, shows him hell, the 
wrath and the judgment of God. This is the actual office 
of the law. 

591 Then follows the custom of this office, that the 
sinner may know that the law reveals the sins and does 
not humble him, so that he may despair, but that it may 
drive him to the Savior and Comforter Christ by its 
accusation and crushing. When this happens, he is no 
longer under the disciplinarian, and this custom is very 
necessary; for since the whole world is under sin, this 
service of the law is necessary, that it reveal sin, 
otherwise without it no one could attain to 
righteousness, as we have said in detail above. 

592 But what does the law accomplish for those who 
are justified by Christ? Paul answers with these words, 
which are, as it were, a kind of addition: 


V. 25. But now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under the disciplinarian. 


That is, we are free from the law, from the dungeon, 
and from our disciplinarian, for he no longer terrifies and 
torments us after faith is revealed. 

594 Paul is speaking here of the faith that was 
preached through Christ at the appointed time. For 
Christ, having assumed human nature, came once at 
the appointed time, abolished the law with all its effects, 
and by his death freed all those who take hold of his 
benefits in faith from sin and eternal death. So when you 
look at Christ and what he has accomplished, there is 
no longer any law. For since he came at the predestined 
time, he actually did right. 





(verissime) the whole law is abolished. But since the law 
is abolished, we are no longer kept under its tyranny, but 
live safely and joyfully under Christ, who now reigns in 
us with his Spirit in a loving way. But where the Lord is, 
there is liberty [2 Cor. 3:17]. 

Therefore, if we could fully grasp Christ, who has 
abolished the law and reconciled us sinners to the 
Father through his death, this disciplinarian would have 
no right over us. But the law in our members contradicts 
the law in our minds, so that we cannot grasp Christ 
perfectly. The defect, therefore, is not in Christ, but in us, 
who have not yet put off the flesh, to which sin clings as 
long as we live. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we 
are partly free from the law and partly under the law. We 
serve, with Paul, "with the mind the law of God, but with 
the flesh the law of sin", Rom. 7, 25. 

It follows that we are completely free from the law 
according to conscience. Therefore, the disciplinarian 
does not have to rule in it, that is, he does not have to 
be burdensome to it with his terrors, threats and 
imprisonment, and as much as it may try to do so, the 
conscience is not troubled by it, because it has Christ, 
the crucified, before its eyes, who has taken away from 
the conscience everything that the law has to do with 


(omnia officia legis), Col. 2:14: "And has blotted out the 
handwriting that was against us, which was by statutes" 
2c. Just as a virgin knows nothing of a man, so the 
conscience must not only know nothing of the law, but 
must even be completely dead to it, and again the law 
to the conscience. This is not by works or any 
righteousness of the law, but by faith which takes hold 
of Christ. 

597 In fact, sin still clings to the flesh, which 
continually accuses and troubles the conscience. Thus, 
as far as the flesh remains, the law also remains a 
disciplinarian, which continually frightens and saddens 
the conscience by denouncing sin and threatening 
death. 


462 Il, 122-125. 


598. But it is always raised up again by the daily 


coming (adventu) of Christ, who, as he once came into 
the world at the appointed time to redeem us from the 
exceedingly hard rule of our disciplinarian, so comes to 
us daily in a spiritual way, having to do with it, that we 
may grow in faith and in the knowledge of Him, so that 
the conscience may more perfectly grasp Christ from 
day to day, and that from day to day the law of the flesh 
and of sin, the fear of death, and all the evils which the 
law brings with it, may be more and more diminished. 
For as long as we live in the flesh, which is not without 
sin, the law returns again and again and does its work, 
in some more, in others less, depending on whether they 
have weak or strong faith, but not to destruction but to 
salvation. For this is what the law accomplishes 


(exercitium) in the saints, the daily slaying of the flesh, 
of reason and of our powers, and the renewing of our 
minds, Eph. 4:23. 

So we receive the firstfruits of the spirit, the leaven is 
hidden in the dough, but the dough is not yet leavened, 
but has only begun to ferment. When | look at the leaven, 
| see nothing but mere leaven; but when | look at the 
whole dough, it is not yet mere leaven. That is, when | 
look at Christ, | am completely holy and pure, knowing 
nothing of the law, for Christ is my leaven. But when | 
look at my flesh, | feel avarice, unchastity, anger, 
arrogance, fear of death, sadness, terror, hatred, 
grumbling and impatience against God. If these are 
present, Christ is not present, or if he is present, he is 
only weakly present. Here a disciplinarian is still needed, 
who will train and afflict the strong ass, the flesh, so that 
through this discipline the sins will be diminished and the 
way prepared for Christ. For Christ, as he once came in 
time bodily, abolished the whole law, took away sin, 
death and hell.

463 


destroyed. Thus, he comes to us in a spiritual way 
without ceasing and constantly eradicates and kills 
these things in us. 

600. | say this so that you will know how to answer 
when they say to you: Christ came into the world, and all 
at once took away all our sins by cleansing us with his 
blood: why then do we hear the gospel, what need is 
there of absolution and the sacrament? It is true that if 
you look at Christ, the law and sin are indeed taken 
away. But Christ has not yet come to you, or if he has 
come, there are still remnants of sin in you, you are not 
yet completely leavened. For where there is still evil 
desire, sadness of spirit, fear of death, 2c. there is still 
law and sin, Christ is not yet there in truth; when he 
comes, he casts out fear and sadness and brings peace 
and security of conscience. Therefore, as far as | take 
hold of Christ in faith, so far is the law removed from me. 
But my flesh, the world and the devil do not allow faith to 
be perfect. | would like the little light of faith in my heart 
to be spread through the whole body and all the 
members. But this does not happen, it is not spread out 
immediately, but only the beginning is made that it is 
spread out. In the meantime, our comfort is that since 
we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, we have begun to be 
leavened, but we will be leavened completely when this 
sinful body is dissolved and we are raised anew with 
Christ. 

Although Christ is yesterday and today, and the same 
also for eternity [Heb. 13:8], and although Adam and all 
the blessed before Christ had the gospel and faith, yet 
Christ came only once at the predetermined time, also 
faith came only once, when the apostles preached the 
gospel throughout the whole world. Then Christ also 
comes daily in a spiritual way, faith also comes daily 
through the word of the Gospel. When faith is present, 
the disciplinarian with his sad and burdensome ministry 
must leave. But Christ comes in a spiritual way, when 
we are more and more

on Christ. 
604. "Put on Christ" can be understood in two ways, 


according to the Law and according to the Gospel. 
According to the law, as Rom. 


466 Li. "ai. II, 127-130. 


2c., a new will arises. This is what it really means to 
attract Christ in a true and evangelical way. 

Therefore, in baptism, not the garment of 
righteousness of the law or of our works is given, but 
Christ becomes our garment. He is not a law, not a 
lawgiver, not a work, but a divine and ineffable gift, which 
the Father gave us, that he might be our justifier, 
quickener, and redeemer. Therefore, to put on Christ in 
an evangelical way is not to put on the law and works, 
but to put on the inestimable gift, namely the forgiveness 
of sins, righteousness, peace, comfort, joy in the Holy 
Spirit, salvation, life and Christ Himself. 

608 This passage is to be carefully observed against 
the enthusiasts, who — diminish the glory of 

baptism and 
speak disgracefully and ungodly of it. Paul, on the other 
hand, adorns baptism with glorious names, calling it a 
bath of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit, Titus 3:5; 
and here he says that all who are baptized have put on 
Christ, as if to say: Ye have not received by baptism a 


mere outward sign (tesseram), by which ye are received 
into the number of Christians, as in our time many 
enthusiasts have held, who have made of baptism only 
an outward sign, that is, a short-lived and empty sign; but 
he says, "As many as are baptized of you have put on 
Christ," that is, ye are taken out of the law, and put into 
a new birth, which was effected in baptism. Therefore 
you are no longer under the law, but in a new garment, 
that is, you are clothed with the righteousness of Christ. 

So Paul teaches that baptism is not a sign, but a 
garment of Christ, even that Christ himself is our 
garment. Therefore, baptism is the most powerful and 
effective. 

But if we have put on Christ as the garment of our 
righteousness and our blessedness, we shall also put on 
Christ as the garment of discipleship. | have dealt with 
this more fully elsewhere, so | will touch on it only briefly 
now. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2345-2348. 


467 


V. 28. Here is neither Jew nor Greek, here is 
neither bond nor free, here is neither male nor 
female. 

Here one can name even more names of persons 
and offices, which are ordered by God, than, here is no 
authority nor subject, here is no teacher nor hearer, here 
is no disciplinarian nor pupil, here is no woman nor 
maidservant, because in Christ Jesus all ranks, even 
those that God has ordered, are nothing. Man, woman, 
servant, free man, Jew, Gentile, king, subject 2c. are 
indeed good creatures of God, but in Christ, that is, in 
the matter of salvation they are nothing with all their 
wisdom, righteousness, worship, power. 

Therefore, with these words, "There is no Jew here," 
2c. Paul most strongly abolishes the law. For here, 
where a new man is made in baptism, and Christ is put 
on, there is neither Jew nor Greek 2c. But here the 
apostle speaks of a Jew, not as a naturalist speaks of it 


(physice), according to the natural essence 


(substantiam), but he calls the one Jew who is a disciple 
of Moses, subject to the laws, who is circumcised and 
keeps with the greatest diligence the divine service 
commanded in the law. He says, "Where Christ is put 
on, there is no longer a Jew, there is no longer 
circumcision, there is no longer worship in the temple, 
there are no longer laws which the Jews keep. For Christ 
has done away with all the laws of the scriptures of 
Moses in the whole world. 

Therefore, a conscience that believes in Christ must 
be so sure that the law, with its terrors and threats, has 
been done away with, that it does not know at all 
whether there ever was a Moses, a law, or a Jew, 
because Christ and Moses do not agree with each other 
in any way. Moses comes with the law, various works 
and services, but Christ comes without law at all, without 
works, giving grace, righteousness 2c. Joh. 1, 17: "For 
the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth 
came through Jesus Christ. 

614 Further, when he says, "There is no Greek here," 
he also rejects and condemns the wisdom and 
righteousness of the Gentiles. For among the Gentiles 
there were great and exceedingly excellent

Men: Xenophon, Themistocles, Marcus Fabius, Attilius 
Regulus, Cicero, Pomponius Atticus and many others, 
who, gifted with excellent and truly heroic virtues, have 
governed the states in the best way and have executed 
many things in the most excellent way for the good of the 
commonwealth 2c. And yet all these, with their wisdom, 
power, exceedingly honorable deeds, glorious virtues, 
laws, righteousness, worship and religion (for we need 
not imagine that the pagans were entirely despisers of 
honorableness and religion, for all pagans at all times, 
scattered throughout the world, have had their laws, 
worship and religions, without which the human race 
cannot possibly be governed), these, | say, with all this 
their adornment, are nothing before God. Therefore, 
everything that belongs to the righteousness of the 
household and world regiment and the righteousness 


before God (divinae) (as the righteousness of the Law 
was), with the highest obedience, the best handling of the 
law and the greatest holiness, is absolutely nothing 
before God. What then? The garment of Christ, which we 
put on in baptism. 

615. In such a way, a servant may perform his office 
with great care, be obedient to his master, serve faithfully, 
a suitor may in a praiseworthy manner preside over the 
state or the household and govern it, likewise everything 
that a man may do as a man, by taking a wife, presides 
over the household, obeys the authorities, behaves 
honorably toward everyone, as is proper when an 
honorable woman lives chastely, obeys her husband, 
takes care of the house diligently, brings up her children 
well (which are certainly highly praiseworthy and 
delicious gifts and works), yet all this serves nothing for 
righteousness before God. In short, all the laws, 
ceremonies, worship, righteousness and works that exist 
in the whole world, even among the Jews, who before 
others had their kingdom and priesthood instituted and 
ordered by God, with their laws, worship and worship 
practices: yet all this does not take away sins, does not 
deliver from death, does not make one blessed. 

616 Therefore your false apostles deceive you.

stel, dear Galatians, since they teach that the law is 
necessary for salvation, and in this way snatch you away 
from the exceedingly great glory of your new birth and 
childship, and put you back into the old birth and the 
completely miserable bondage of the law, by making you 
from completely free children of God into servants of the 
law, since they want to distinguish the persons 
according to the law. 

Of course, according to the law there is also a 
difference of persons before the world, and there it must 
be fine, but not so before God, where all men are equal. 
[Rom. 3, 23: "They are all sinners and lack the glory they 
should have in God." Therefore, before God, Jews, 
Gentiles and all the world must be silent. Although God 
has many orders, laws, statuses, and services in the 
world, these do not serve to merit grace and to attain 
eternal life. As many as are therefore justified, they are 
not justified because of the keeping of any human or 
divine law, but because of Christ, who has done away 
with all laws altogether. The gospel holds him up to us 
as the only propitiator of God's wrath, who accomplished 
this through his own blood and is our Savior. If one does 
not believe in him, he will not be saved: a Jew not by the 
law, amonk not by his order, a pagan not by his wisdom, 


the authorities or a lord not by right conduct (justitiam) 
in the world or house government, a servant and a maid 
not by their obedience 2c. 


For you are all one in Christ Jesus. 


These are very delicious and comprehensive words. 
In the world and according to the flesh there is a very 
great difference and inequality of persons, and this must 
be most carefully maintained. For if a woman were to be 
a man, a son a father, a disciple a teacher, a servant a 
lord, a subject a ruler, a great disorder and confusion of 
all ranks and things would result. In Christ, on the other 
hand, there is no law, no distinction of persons; there is 
not Jew, Greek, 2c., but they are all one. For there is 
[Eph. 4, 4-6.] "One body and one Spirit, just as we were 
called to be one and the same. 


470 Dii- 6-u- H' 132-135. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vm, 2351-2354. 


Hope of our profession", one and the same gospel, "One 
faith, One baptism, One God and Father of all", One 
Christ, the Lord over all. The same Christ that Peter, Paul 
and all the saints have, we also have, |, you and all 
believers, the same also all baptized children have. So 
the conscience knows nothing of the law, but has only 
Christ before its eyes. That is why Paul always adds: "in 
Christ Jesus". If this is taken away from our eyes, then 
our salvation has been lost. 

619. Nowadays, the enthusiasts speak of faith in 
Christ in the manner of the sophists, dreaming that it is 
a quality that belongs to the heart without Christ being 
present. This is a pernicious error. But Christ must be 
placed before your eyes in such a way that you see 
nothing at all apart from him, and believe that nothing is 
closer to you and more closely associated with you than 
he is. For he does not sit idly in heaven, but is present 
with us all the time, working and living in us, as is said 
above in Cap. 2, 20: "I live, yet now not |, but Christ lives 
in me," 2c., and here: "Ye have put on Christ." Therefore, 


faith is a completely unchanging reputation (intutus), 
which looks to nothing else than Christ, the conqueror of 
sin and death and the giver of righteousness, 
blessedness and eternal life. Therefore, Paul presents 
Jesus Christ to us in his epistles almost in every verse 
and powerfully drives the teaching of him alone. But he 
presents him to us through the word, because he cannot 
be grasped in any other way than through faith in the 
word. 

This is beautifully illustrated by the bronze serpent, 
which is an image of Christ. Moses commanded the 
Jews, who were bitten by the fiery serpents in the desert, 
to do nothing else than to look at this bronze serpent with 
unblinking eyes. Those who did this were healed only by 


the constant (fixa) sight of the serpent. The others, 
however, who did not obey the voice of Moses by looking 
at their wounds and not at the serpent, died. Thus, if 1am 
to receive consolation in the battle of conscience or in 
mortal distress, | must receive nothing else at all. 





474 


take hold of the one Christ in faith and say: | believe in 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who suffered, was 
crucified and died for me, 2c. In whose wounds and 
death | see my sin, in his resurrection the victory over 
sin, death and the devil, likewise righteousness and 
eternal life. Apart from him | will neither hear nor see 
anything. This is the right Christian faith and the right 
faith in Christ, through which we become members of his 
body, of his flesh and legs. So we live, weave and are in 
him. 

For this reason, the speculative play on the faith of 
the enthusiasts, who dream that Christ is only in a 
spiritual way, that is, in that we have thoughts of him 


(speculative), but in reality and truth (realiter) he is in 
heaven, is a vain and ungodly play on thoughts 
(speculatio). Christ and faith must be absolutely 
connected with each other; we must be in heaven 


(versari) and Christ must be in us, live and work. He 
lives and works in us not only in our thoughts 


(speculative), but in fact and truth, completely present 
and exceedingly powerful. 


V. 29. But if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's 
seed, and heirs according to the promise. 


That is, if you believe and are baptized into Christ, if 
you believe (I say) that he is the promised seed of 
Abraham, who brought blessing to all nations, then you 
are Abraham's children, not by nature, but adopted 
children. For the Scripture gives him not only children 
according to the flesh, but also adopted children and 
children according to the promise, and says beforehand 
that these shall obtain the inheritance, but those shall be 
cast out of the house. Thus Paul, by a brief word, 
transfers all the glory of Lebanon, that is, of the Jewish 
people, to the wilderness, that is, to the Gentiles. 

This passage contains an exceedingly rich 
consolation, namely that the Gentiles are to be 
Abraham's children and consequently also God's 
children. But they are Abraham's children, not by fleshly 
procreation, but by promise. So the kingdom of heaven, 
which belongs to 


472 6ai. Il, |3S-I37. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 3, 29. W. VIII, 234-2360. 


473 





Life and eternal inheritance to the Gentiles, and this was 
indicated by the Scriptures long before, when they say 
[Gen. 17:4, Rom. 4:17]: "| have made thee the father of 
many nations," and likewise [Gen. 22:18]: "Through thy 
seed shall all nations be blessed." Because we Gentiles 
thus believe, and by faith accept the blessing promised 
to Abraham and given through Christ, therefore the 
Scriptures call us Abraham's children and heirs, not 
according to the flesh, but according to the promise. 
Thus the promise: "Through your seed" also belongs to 
all Gentiles, and Christ also belongs to us according to 
this promise. 

624 The promise was made to the Jews alone, not to 
us Gentiles, as the 147th Psalm, v. 19, 20, says: "He 
shows Jacob the way. 





his word. He does not do this to a Gentile" 2c. But that 
which is promised has come upon us through faith, by 
which alone the promise of God is grasped. Although it 
has not been promised to us, it has been promised about 
us. For we are called by name in the promise: "Through 
your seed" 2c. For the promise clearly shows that 
Abraham will not only be the father of the Jewish people, 
but of many nations, and that he will be the heir, not only 
of one kingdom, but of the whole world, Rom. 4:13. 

625 Thus the glory of the whole kingdom of Christ is 
transferred to us. Therefore, in the heart and conscience 
of a Christian, all the laws are completely abolished, but 
they remain outwardly in the flesh, as mentioned above 
in detail. 


The fourth chapter. 


V. 1.2. But I say, as long as the heir is a child, there 
is no difference between him and a servant, though he 
be lord of all the goods, but he is among the guardians 
and custodians, until the appointed time of the father. 


You see how Paul is fired up and in the heat to set the 
Galatians right again, and how he deals with the matter, 
with the strongest grounds of proof taken from 
experience, from the example of Abraham, from the’ 
testimonies of Scripture, from time and from parables, so 
that you see that he often starts the whole thing over 
again. For above he had brought the business of 
justification to an end, as it were, since he concluded that 
men are justified before God by faith alone. But because} 


he remembered the worldly (politicum) example of the' 
heir, who is still a child, he also adds this to strengthen 
his case. 

2 So he sets about it all he can, and with a kind of holy 
cunning sets after the Galatians, that he may catch them, 
as he says elsewhere [2 Cor. 12:16.), "Because | was 
deceitful, | caught you with guile." For the people will 





by parables and examples more easily than by difficult 
and sharp disputations. It prefers to see a well-painted 
1) picture than a well-written book. 

(3) Therefore, after the parable of the testament of a 
man, of the prison, and of the disciplinarian, he takes 
also this very well-known parable of the heir, that he may 
move them. It is very useful to have parables and 
examples ready when teaching; not only Paul, but also 
the prophets and Christ himself used them very often. 
Afterwards, until the end of the letter, he proceeds 
oratorically. 

You see, he says, that it is established in the civil laws 
that an heir, although he is a lord over all paternal goods, 
is nevertheless a servant. He has a certain claim to the 
inheritance, but in the period preceding the period of fine 
maturity ([emancipationis] as the jurists call it), the 
guardians and custodians keep him imprisoned and 
decided, like a disciplinarian his pupil. They do not hand 
over to him the administration of the goods nor 


1) Wittenberger: pentzaietairt instead: Ucnc pietam. 


474 Dii. 6ai. Il, 137-139. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2360-2363. 


the dominion, but force him to serve, so that he lives and 
is maintained in his own goods like a servant. So there is 
no difference between him and a servant as long as the 
time of imprisonment and captivity lasts, that is, as long 
as he is under the caretakers and superiors. And this 
subjection and imprisonment is very useful to him, 
because otherwise he would waste the goods in 
ignorance, and this imprisonment is not a permanent 
one, but comes to an end at the appointed time, which 
the Father has prescribed. 


V. 3. So also we, being children, were captives 
under the outward statutes. 


5 So we also, being children, were indeed heirs who 
had the promise of the future inheritance to be given to 
us through the seed of Abraham, Christ, through whom 
all nations would be blessed. But because the fullness of 
time had not yet come, .our guardian, steward and 
disciplinarian Moses came, kept us shut up and 
imprisoned, so that, our hands being bound, we could not 
rule and possess the inheritance. But as meanwhile an 


heir is comforted (lactatur) by the hope of future 
freedom, so Moses comforted us by the hope of the 
promise that was to be revealed in their time, namely that 
Christ would come, who by his coming would put an end 
to this time of the law, which lasted as long as the 
regiment of Moses existed, and bring the time of grace. 

Now the time of the law comes to an end in two ways: 
first, as | have said, by the coming of Christ in the flesh 
at the time appointed by the Father. For Christ became 
man once in time, "born of a virgin, and was put under 
the law, that he might redeem them which were under the 
law" [Gal. 4:4, 5]. "He entered once into the Holy by His 
own blood, and invented an eternal redemption" [Heb. 
9:12]. 

7 Then the same Christ who came once in time 
comes to us in spirit every hour of every day. Once he 
has given us through his own blood 





475 


We are redeemed and all sanctified, but because we are 
not yet completely pure, for the remnants of sin still cling 
to our flesh, which contends against the Spirit, he comes 
daily in a spiritual way, and day by day completes more 
and more the time predestined by the Father, abolishing 
and canceling the law. 

(8) So also to the fathers in the Old Testament he 
came in the spirit before he appeared in the flesh. They 
had Christ in the spirit, in whom they believed as in him 
who was to be revealed, as we believe in him now that 
he is revealed, and they were saved through him just as 
we are, according to this word [Heb. 13:8]: "JEsus Christ 
yesterday and today, and the same forever." 
"Yesterday" is the time before he came into the flesh, 
"today," since he is revealed in time. It is therefore the 
same Christ now and forever, through whom alone all 
believers in past, present, and future time are delivered 
from the law, justified, and saved. 

9 "So also we," he says, "being children, were 
imprisoned under the outward statutes," that is, the law 
ruled over us, oppressing us as servants and prisoners 
with hard bondage. First of all, it kept the rough and 
carnal people in civil restraint, so that they would not fall 
impetuously into all kinds of shameful deeds. For the law 
threatens the transgressors with life punishment; if they 
did not fear this, they would practice all kinds of evil. 
Those whom the law thus keeps in check, it rules over. 

10. secondly, spiritually or theologically, it accused, 
terrified, killed and condemned us before God, and this 
was the main dominion of the law over us. Thus, as an 
heir subject to guardians is beaten by them, forced to 
obey their laws and diligently carry out their commands, 
so consciences, before Christ came, are oppressed by 
the harsh tyranny of the law, that is, they are sued, 
terrified, and condemned by the law. But this rule or 
rather tyranny of the law is not eternal, but is to last only 
until the time of grace. Therefore the office of the law is 
to punish and to multiply sins, but for righteousness, 


476 Dri- "Li. Il, 139-141. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 4, 3, W. VIII, 2363-2366. 


that it kills, but to life. For the law is a disciplinarian of 
Christ. 

(11) Therefore, just as the guardians treat the heir 
who is a child harshly, rule over him and command him 
as a servant, and he is forced to be their subject, so the 
law accuses us, humiliates us and makes us servants, 
so that we are servants of sin, death and the wrath of 
God, which is certainly the most miserable and harshest 
servitude. But as the rule of the guardians and the 
subjection and bondage of the heir who is a child is not 
an eternal one, but lasts only until the time appointed by 
the father, and when the time is completed he no longer 
needs the guardianship of the stewards, nor remains 
subject to them henceforth, but enjoys at his pleasure 
the paternal inheritance, so the law rules over us, and 
we are forced to be servants and captives under its rule, 
but not forever. There must also be added the piece 
which follows: "Until the appointed time from the Father." 
For the promised Christ has come and redeemed us 
who were oppressed by the tyranny of the law. 

(i)12. On the other hand, the coming of Christ is of no 
use to the sure hypocrites and the obviously godless 
despisers, even to the despairing ones who think that 
there is nothing left but the terror of the law that they feel. 
It is only of use to those who have been troubled and 
frightened by the law for a while, that is, to those who do 
not despair in the serious terror that the law arouses, but 
who confidently approach Christ, the throne of grace, 
who has redeemed them from the curse of the law, since 
he has become a curse for them: these will find mercy 
and grace 2c. 

13 There is therefore a special emphasis on the 
word: "We were imprisoned", as if he wanted to say: Our 
conscience was subjected to the law which kept us 
locked up and imprisoned, which, like a tyrant to his 
captive servant, scourged us and made us lose all our 
freedom.

477 


It made us fearful, sad, pale, desperate, and threatened 
us with eternal death and damnation. This theological 
bondage is the hardest, but, as | said, not eternal, but 
lasts only as long as we are children, that is, as long as 
Christ is not there. When He is not here, we are servants, 
shut up under the law, without grace, faith, and all the 
gifts of the Holy Spirit. But after Christ has come, this 
imprisonment and bondage of the law ceases. 


Among the external statutes (sub elementis mundi 
hujus). 

Some have thought that Paul is talking about the 
earthly elements, fire, air, water and earth. But Paul has 
his peculiar way of speaking and speaks here just in front 


of God's laws, which he calls in a diminutive way (per 


tapinosin) "the elements of this world", and his words 
are very heretical. Also elsewhere [2 Cor. 3, 6. 7.Paul 
uses to diminish the law very much, calling it a letter that 
kills, a ministry of death and condemnation, the power of 
sin, and these exceedingly hateful names, which clearly 
and actually indicate the power and custom of the law, 
he chooses deliberately to remind us, that in the terrors 
of sin, wrath, and the judgment of God, one must not rely 
on one's own righteousness or the righteousness of the 
law, since the law in its best use can do nothing but make 
consciences guilty, increase sin, and threaten death and 
eternal damnation. Therefore, these reductions of the 
law are spoken only for those who are in distress of 
conscience, not in relation to civil life and for safe hearts. 

(15) Thus he calls the law "elements of the world," 
that is, external letters or statutes written in a certain 
book. For though the law civilly restrains from evil, and 
urges to do good, yet, if it is kept in the proper way, it 
does not therefore deliver from sins, it does not justify, it 
does not prepare the way to heaven, but it leaves men 
in the world. For this is why | do not attain righteousness. 


478 Lri. Kai. Il, 141-143. 


| will not die, | will not commit adultery, | will not be guilty 
of theft 2c. These outward virtues and an honorable 
conduct are not Christ's kingdom nor heavenly 
righteousness, but are a righteousness of the flesh and 
of the world, which also the heathen have, not only the 
works saints, as at the time of Christ the Pharisees, and 
our monks 2c. Some allow themselves to be in this 
worldly righteousness in order to avoid the penalties of 
the law, others in order to be praised by men as 
steadfast, righteous, patient people 2c. Therefore, it 
should be called appearance and hypocrisy rather than 
righteousness. 

‘Furthermore, the law, even in its best use and 
highest power, can do nothing but accuse, terrify, 
condemn and kill. But where there is fear and feeling of 
sin, death, wrath and judgment of God, there is certainly 
no righteousness, nothing heavenly, nothing divine, but 
all these are only things of the world, which is nothing 
else, since it is the devil's kingdom, but a right confluence 
of the filth of sin, death, hell and all evil, which the fearful 
and frightened feel, the secure and despisers do not feel. 
Therefore, even in its proper use, the law only reveals 
and increases sin and instills fear of death; these are 
certainly worldly things. Therefore it is obvious that the 
law does not give life, salvation, heavenly or divine 
things, but only worldly things; therefore Paul rightly calls 
it "an element of the world". 

17 Although Paul calls the whole law elements of the 
world, as can be understood from what has already been 
said, it is mainly the ceremonial laws that he speaks so 
contemptuously of, which, he says, though they 
accomplish much, yet only order something in certain 
outward things, such as food, drink, clothing, place, time, 
temple, feasts, ablutions, sacrifices, 2c. which are merely 
worldly, and ordered by God only for the custom of the 
present life, not that they should be kept from the world.

Menius) for s 10 of the 12th chapter of the Table Talks. In our edition

Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. 


W. VIII, 2366-2369. 479 


God righteousness and salvation. Therefore, by this little 
word "elements of the world" he rejects and condemns 
all the legal righteousness that lay in these outward 
ceremonies, although they were ordered and 
commanded by God to be kept for a time, and calls them 
by the most contemptible name "elements of the world". 

Thus the imperial laws are elements of the world, for 
they deal with things of the world that belong to this life, 
such as money, possessions, inheritance, murder, 
adultery, robbery, etc., of which the second tablet of the 
holy ten commandments deals. But the decrees and the 
papal laws, which forbid marriage and food, Paul calls 
elsewhere [1 Tim. 4, 1.] "doctrines of devils", which are 
also elements of the world, only that they put against the 
word of God and the faith from external things to the 
most ungodly commandments. 

*Therefore, the law of Moses does nothing but 
worldly things, i.e., in civil and theological terms it only 
shows the evil that is in the world. But when it is in proper 
use, it urges the conscience with its terrors to thirst and 
seek the promise of God, and to look to Christ. 

(20) But for this the grace of the Holy Spirit is 
necessary, who says in the heart: It is not the will of God, 
after the law has done its work on you, that you should 
only be frightened and killed, but since you have known 
your misery and ruin through the law, you should not 
despair, but believe in Christ, who is the end of the law; 
"he who believes in him is righteous. Here nothing 
worldly happens, but here all worldly things cease, all 
laws, and the divine begins. So long as we are under the 
elements of the world, that is, under the law, which only 
indicates and increases sins and incurs wrath, but does 
not give justice and peace to the conscience, we are 
servants, subject to the law, although we have the 
promise of future blessing. True, the law says: "You shall

love God your Lord", but it cannot do that | do this or that 
| obtain Christ. 

1(21) | do not say this with the intention that one 
should despise the law, nor does Paul have this in mind, 
but one should hold it very dear and valuable. But since 
Paul is dealing here with the article of justification (the 
business of justification is far different from that of the 
law), necessity required that he speak of the law as a 
very contemptible thing, and even we, when we speak 
of this matter, cannot speak of it lightly and spitefully 
enough. Therefore the conscience, when it is in real 
distress, must think and know nothing but Christ alone, 
and make every effort to put the law out of sight as far 
as possible, and take hold of nothing but the promise of 
Christ. 

22. This is easy to say, but to do so in temptation, 
when the conscience deals with God, is the most difficult 
thing, namely, that even when the law terrifies you, 
accuses you, shows you sin, threatens the wrath of God 
and death, you should be of the same mind as if there 
had never been a law or any sin, but only Christ, only 
grace and salvation, or, even if you feel the terror of the 
law, you should still say: Law, | will not hear thee, for 


thou hast an impeditam and heavy tongue. Then also 
the fullness of time has already come, therefore | am 
free. | will therefore no longer suffer your dominion 2c. 
There one sees that it is the most difficult thing to 
distinguish the law from grace, how it is a completely 
divine and heavenly gift, that here, since nothing can be 
hoped for, one believes in hope, and that this saying of 
Paul, that we are justified by faith alone, is completely 
true. 

23 Therefore learn from this that in the trade of 
justification according to the apostle's example you are 
most contemptuously speaking of the

(in the translation of Menius) for the Table Talks, Cap. 12,s 12 tos

Talks. 


Laws, since he calls the law elements of the world, 
death-bringing statutes, the power of sin 2c. For if you 
allow the law to rule in your conscience, if you have to 
deal with overcoming sin and death before God, then the 
law is in fact nothing but a cesspool of all evils, heresies 
2) and blasphemies, for it only increases sin, accuses, 
terrifies, threatens death, shows God as an angry judge 
who condemns sinners. Therefore, if you are wise, reject 
here the babbling and stammering Moses with his law 
as far as possible, and his terrors and threats shall not 
move you in any way. Here, he shall be absolutely 
suspicious to you as a heretic, 3) a banished one, a 
damned one, who is worse than the pope and the devil, 
who therefore should not be heard at all. 

(24) By the way, outside the article of justification, we 
should, like Paul, hold the law in great honor and praise 
it exceedingly highly, calling it holy, righteous, good, 
spiritual, divine 2c. Outside the conscience we must 
make a god out of it, but in the conscience it is in truth a 
devil, because it cannot raise and comfort the 
conscience even in the slightest challenge, but does just 
the opposite, frightens and saddens it, and tears it away 
from the confidence that it will attain righteousness, life 
and all good. Therefore Paul calls the law afterwards [v. 
9] "weak and meager statutes". Therefore we should not 
let it rule our conscience in any way, especially since it 
cost Christ so much to remove the tyranny of the law 
from our conscience. Therefore he became a curse for 
us, that he might redeem us from the curse of the law. 

(25) Therefore let a godly man learn that the law and 
Christ are two mutually repugnant and wholly 
incompatible things. Where Christ is, the law cannot rule 
in any way, but must depart from the conscience and 
leave the bed to Christ alone (which is too narrow for two 
people to occupy).

(Is. 28, 20.). He alone shall reign in righteousness, 
safety, joy and life, so that the conscience can happily 
fall asleep in Christ without feeling the law, sin and 
death. 

(26) And Paul makes careful use of this figure of 
speech, "elements of the world," by which, as | have 
said, he greatly diminishes the prestige and glory of the 
law, that is, in order that he may cheer us up. For when 
an attentive reader of Paul's writings hears that the 
apostle calls the law a ministry of death, a letter that kills, 
2c., the thought immediately comes to him why Paul 
attaches such hateful and, as it seems to reason, 
blasphemous names to the law, which is a divine 
teaching revealed from heaven. To him who labors and 
seeks to know the reason of these names, Paul 
answers: the law is both holy, righteous, good 2c., and 
an office of sin and death, but with respect to different 
things. Before Christ it is holy, after Christ it is death. 
Therefore, when Christ has come, we must know 
absolutely nothing of the law, except in so far as it is to 
have its dominion over the flesh, which it holds in check 
and oppresses. Therefore the law and the flesh (to 
whom the dominion of the law is a heavy one) fight 
together until we die. 

27 Paul is the only one among the apostles who calls 
the law of God the elements of the world, weak and 
meager statutes, the power of sin, a letter that kills 2c. 
The other apostles did not speak of the law in this way. 


Therefore, every one who is studious of Christian 


theology (studiosus) should pay careful attention to this 
way of speaking of Paul. Christ calls him a chosen 
instrument [Apost. 9, 15], therefore he also gave him a 
chosen mouth and a special way of speaking before the 
other apostles, so that he as a chosen instrument laid 
the foundations of the article of justification most 
faithfully and taught it most clearly.

V. 4. 5. But when the time was fulfilled, God sent 
His Son, born of a woman, and put under the law, to 
redeem those who were under the law. 

28 That is, after the time of the law was fulfilled, and 
Christ was now revealed, and had set us free from the 
law, and the promise was proclaimed among all the 
Gentiles 2c. 

29 Pay attention to how Paul describes Christ here. 
Christ, he says, is the Son of God and of a woman, who 
was put under the law for us sinners, so that he might 
redeem us who were under the law. With these words he 
summarized both, the person and the ministry of Christ. 
The person consists of the divine and the human nature. 
This he clearly indicates, since he says, "GOtt sent His 
Son, born of a woman." Thus, it is Christ true GOD and 
true man. But His ministry He describes with these 
words: "Put under the law, that He might redeem them 
which were under the law." 

(30) And Paul, as it seems to be a disgrace, calls the 
virgin, the mother of the Son of God, only a woman, 
which also displeased some of the old fathers, who 
would have preferred that he had used the name "virgin" 
as "woman" in this place. In this epistle, Paul deals with 
the most important and highest matter, namely, the 
gospel, faith, and Christian righteousness; likewise, what 
kind of person Christ is, what his ministry is, what he has 
taken upon himself and done for our sake, what good 
deeds he has done for us poor sinners. That is why it is 
about such astonishingly great things that he did not pay 
any special attention to virginity. It was enough for him to 
praise the abundant and infinite mercy of God, that God 
condescended to let His Son be born of the female sex. 
Therefore, he did not mention the worthiness of this 
gender, but only the gender itself, and by naming the 
gender, he indicates that Christ himself became a true 
man from the female gender, as if he wanted to say: "He 
is not of man". 


484 Lrt. vLi. Il, 148-150. Explanation of Galatians 4, 4. 5. W. VIII, 2376-2379. 


and woman, but only of the female sex. Therefore, since 
he mentions only the female gender, saying that he was 
born of a woman is the same as saying that he was born 
of a virgin. Since the evangelist John describes that the 
Word, which was in the beginning, 2c. became flesh, he 
also does not remember the mother with one word. 

31 Furthermore, this passage also testifies that 
Christ, when the time of the law had expired, took it away 
and freed those who were oppressed by it, and that he 
did not give a new one after the old one and above the 
old law of Moses. Therefore the monks and sophists do 
not err less corruptly, nor do they do less dishonor to 
Christ, because they imagine that he has given a new 
law, above Moses, than the Turks, who boast that their 
Mahomet is a new and better lawgiver than Christ. He did 
not come to abolish the old law in order to give a new 
one, but, as Paul says here, he was sent into the world 
by the Father so that he might redeem those who were 
held captive under the law. 

32 These words depict Christ rightly and actually, 
giving Him not the office of giving a new law, but of 
redeeming those who were under the law, and Christ 
Himself says John 8:15: "I judge no man"; and elsewhere 
[John 12:47]: "| am not come to judge the world, but to 
make the world blessed." That is, | have not come to give 
a law, and by the same judge men, as Moses and other 
lawgivers, but | administer a higher and better office. The 
law killed you; I, on the other hand, judge, condemn, and 
kill the law, thus freeing you from its tyranny. 

We, the ancients, who were immersed in the 
pernicious papist doctrine, which we imbibed into our 
bones and innermost marrow, received a completely 
different conception of Christ than Paul presents here. 
For as much as they professed with their mouths that 
Christ had redeemed us from the bondage and tyranny 
of the law, they in fact believed in their hearts that he was 
a lawgiver, tyrant and judge, who was even more terrible 
than Christ. 


485 


than Moses himself. And this pernicious opinion, even 
nowadays, when the light of truth shines so brightly, we 
cannot completely cast out of our hearts; so firmly do we 
cling to what we have been accustomed to from our 
youth. 

You young people, who are still new vessels and not 
yet infected by this ungodly opinion, can learn to 
recognize Christ more easily than we old people can put 
these blasphemous ideas of him out of our minds. But 
because of this you will not completely escape the 
cunning attempts of the devil. For even though you are 
not yet tainted with this ungodly delusion that Christ is a 
lawgiver, you still have everything that can serve this 


purpose (ipsa materialia), that is, the flesh, reason and 
corrupt nature, which cannot judge Christ differently than 
that he is a lawgiver. Therefore, you must strive with the 
greatest effort to learn to recognize and look at Christ as 
Paul depicts him here. But if ungodly teachers, of whom 
the world is always full, are added to this corrupt nature, 
they strengthen the wickedness of nature, so that a 
twofold evil arises, that is, the evil instruction increases 
and strengthens the harmful error of blind reason, which 
by nature judges that Christ is a lawgiver, and impresses 
this error on the minds so powerfully that it cannot be 
cast off without great effort and exertion. 

(35) It is therefore very useful to keep in mind and 
always keep in mind this very sweet and comforting 
saying and similar sayings that describe Christ actually 
and clearly, so that in all of life, in all dangers, in the 
confession of faith before tyrants, at the hour of death, 
we may be able to say with certain and constant 
confidence: Law, you have no right to me, therefore you 
accuse and condemn me in vain. For | believe in Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, whom the Father sent into the 
world to redeem us wretched sinners, oppressed by the 
tyranny of the law. He laid down his life and gave it most 
generously for me. Therefore, when | see your terrors 
and

If | feel threats, O law, then | sink my conscience into] Therefore he owed nothing to the law, and yet the law 


Christ's wounds, blood, death, resurrection and victory; 
apart from Him | want to see and hear nothing at all. 
This faith is our victory [1 John 5:4], through which we 
overcome the terrors of the law, sin, death and all evil, 
but not without great struggle. The truly godly, who are 
daily plagued by severe temptations, have great difficulty 
here. It often occurs to them that Christ wants to confront 
us and demand an account of how we have spent our 
lives, that he wants to accuse and condemn us. They 
cannot certainly insist that he is sent by the Father to 
redeem us who are oppressed by the tyranny of the law, 
This is because the saints have not yet completely put off 
the flesh, but the flesh is contrary to the spirit. Therefore, 
the terrors of the law keep returning, the fear of death and| 
other sad images (spectra) that hinder faith from 
grasping with as much certainty as it should the benefits} 
of Christ who redeemed us from the bondage of the law. 
But in what way or manner did Christ redeem us? This} 
has been the way of redemption: "He is put under the 
law." When Christ came, he found us all as prisoners 
under the disciplinarians and guardians, that is, shut up} 
and kept under the law. What did he do? He is the Lord 
of the law, therefore the law has no right over him, it 
cannot accuse him because he is the Son of God. Since 
he was not under the law, he voluntarily submitted to the} 
law. Then the law exercised all tyranny over him, just as 
it does over us. 1) But it accuses us and terrifies us, 
throws us under the sin, death and wrath of God and 
condemns us by its judgment, and does this rightly, 
because we are all sinners and by nature children of 
wrath. 
. 38. Christ, on the other hand, has not committed any, 
sin, nor is there any deceit in his mouth.

and the Erlanger lacks Unbuit. We followed the latter reading. 


raged against this so innocent, holy, righteous and 
blessed one just as against us cursed and damned 
sinners and 2) even more cruelly. For it accused him as 
a blasphemer and rebel, made him guilty before God of 
all the sins of the whole world, yes, it grieved and 
distressed him so much that he sweated blood and 
finally condemned him by its judgment to death, namely 
to death on the cross. 

(39) This is indeed a strange duel, where the law, a 
creature, thus fights with the Creator and, against all law, 
exercises all the subtle tyranny over the Son of God, 
which it has exercised over us, who are children of wrath. 
Now, because the Law has sinned so terribly and 
ungodly against its GOD, it is rightly required and 
accused. Then Christ says: "Lady Law, you most 
powerful and cruel ruler and queen of the whole human 
race, what have | done that you have accused, terrified 
and condemned me, an innocent man? Here the law, 
which before had condemned and killed all men, having 
nothing with which to defend or purify itself, is again so 
condemned and killed that it loses its right, not only 
against Christ (against whom it unjustly raged and killed 
him), but also against all who believe in him. For to these 
Christ says [Matth. 11, 28.]: "Come unto me all ye that 
labor" under the yoke of the law. | could have overcome 
the law with the highest right without suffering evil, for | 
am the LORD of the law, and therefore it has no right to 
me. But for your sake, who were under the law, | have 
taken your flesh and submitted to the law, that is, out of 
exceeding kindness | have placed myself in the same 
prison, tyranny and bondage of the law, under which you 
were slaves as captives. | have suffered the law to rule 
over me, its Lord, to terrify me, to throw me under sin, 
under death and the wrath of God 2c., which it should 
not have done. Therefore

| overcame, threw down and killed the law with a twofold 
right: firstly as the Son of God, as the Lord of the law, 
secondly in your person, in whose place | have taken 
over, which is just as much as if you yourselves had 
overcome the law, for my victory is your victory. 

In this way, Paul speaks everywhere of this strange 
duel, and in order to make the matter more sweet and 
clear, he uses to represent the law as a living being 


(pingere solet per prosopopoeian), as if it were an 
exceedingly powerful person who had condemned and 
killed Christ, whom he, after overcoming death, had 
again conquered, condemned and killed, Eph. 2, 16: "He 
has killed the enmity by Himself," and Cap. 4,' 8. from the 
68th Psalm, v. 19.: "He ascended on high, and caught 
the prison." He used this personal poetry also in the 
Epistles to the Romans [Cap. 8, 3.], to the Corinthians [2 
Cor. 5, 21.sj and to the Colossians [Cap. 2, 14.]: "He 
condemned sin in the flesh by sin." 

41 By this victory Christ has driven the law out of our 
conscience, so that it can no longer shame us in the sight 
of God, no longer drive us into despair and condemn us. 
It does not refrain from denouncing, accusing and 
terrifying sin, but by grasping the apostle's word: "Christ 
has redeemed us from the law" [Gal. 4:5, 3:13], the 
conscience is raised up by faith and grasps the 
consolation. Yes, with a holy pride it defies the law, 
saying: "| do not care for your terrors and threats, for you 
crucified the Son of God, and indeed you crucified him 
with the greatest injustice. Therefore the sin which you 
committed against him cannot be forgiven, you have lost 
your right, and are now in the future not only overcome 
and strangled with respect to Christ, but also for me who 
believe in him, because he has given me this victory. 
Thus the law has died for us forever, if only we abide in 
Christ. Therefore, thanks be to God, who has given us 
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

42. this also belongs here, that we alone 





Since this duel between the law and Christ took place, 
there were no works or merits on our part, but Christ 
alone, who in our place (induta nostra persona) 
submitted to the law and in the highest innocence 
endured all its tyranny. Therefore, the law, as a robber, 
thief of God and murderer of the Son of God, loses its 
right and deserves to be condemned, so that wherever 
Christ is, or is even mentioned, it must depart far from it 
and flee this name, as the devil flees the cross. 
Therefore, through Christ we who believe are free from 
the oppressor, who has made a triumph of it through 
Himself [Col. 2:14]. Therefore this glorious triumph, 
which Christ has obtained for us, is not obtained by any 
works, but by faith alone. So faith alone justifies. 

(43) As these words, "Christ was put under the law," 
contain much, they should be carefully considered. For 
they indicate that the Son of God, who is under the law, 
has not only done one or the other work of the law, that 
is, that he was not merely circumcised, presented in the 
temple, gone with others to Jerusalem at the appointed 
times, 2c., or that he was only civilly under it, but that he 
endured all the tyranny of the law. For the law in its 
highest use attacked Christ, frightened him so terribly 
that he felt such great fear as no man on earth has ever 
felt. This is sufficiently testified by his bloody sweat, that 
he was strengthened by the angel, and his earnest 
prayer in the garden, finally his pitiful cry at the cross: 
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me!" [Matth. 
27, 46.] 

44. But he endured this "so that he might redeem 
those who were under the law," that is, those who were 
sorrowful, fearful, and in despair, whom sins weighed 
down, as they certainly still weigh down all of us. For 
according to the flesh we still sin daily against all the 
commandments of God, but Paul urges us to be of good 
cheer, saying, "God sent His Son."

491 





'Thus Christ, true God and man, born of God in 
eternity, born of the virgin in time, did not come to give a 
law, but to feel the snail of it in the highest degree and 
thereby to overcome and abolish it. He did not become 
a teacher of the law, but a disciple who was obedient to 
the law, so that by this obedience he might redeem those 
who were under the law. This is quite different from the 
teaching of the papists, who made Christ a lawgiver and 
a stricter one than Moses was. Paul teaches here 
completely the opposite, namely, that God threw His Son 
under the law, that is, that He made Him suffer the 
judgment and the curse of the law, sin, death 2c. For 
Moses, the minister of sin, wrath and death, caught, 
bound, condemned and killed Christ; this he suffered. So 


Christ 2) behaved suffering (passive) against the law, 


not active (active). He is therefore not a lawgiver or a 
judge according to the law, but by submitting to the law 
and bearing its condemnation, he has freed us from its 
curse. 

46 But that Christ in the Gospel gives 
commandments and teaches the law, or rather interprets 
it, does not belong to the locum of justification, but of 
good works. Furthermore, it is not Christ's actual 
ministry, for which he came into the world in the first 
place, that he teaches the law, but this is something 


accidental, just as it was that he healed the sick, raised 
the dead, did good to those who were not worthy of it, 
comforted the afflicted 2c. These are indeed glorious and 
divine works and benefits, but not the actual works of 
Christ. For the prophets also taught the law and 
performed miracles. 

47. but Christ, true God and man, who, contending 
with the law, suffered its utmost fury and tyranny, 


1) Aurifaber used the first half of this paragraph for s 59 of the 7th 
chapter of the Table Talks (in the translation of Menius). In our edition 
of the Table Talks, this paragraph is omitted. 

2) Wittenberger: trabst instead of: bubuit in the Jena and Erlanger. 





Just by doing and suffering the law, he overcame it 
through himself, and after that, when he rose from death, 
he condemned the law, our most bitter enemy, and did it 
out of the means that it can no longer condemn and kill 
believers. 

5For this reason Christ's right and proper office is to 
contend with the law, sin and the death of the whole 
world, and to contend in such a way that he takes these 
things upon himself and by bearing them overcomes 
them through himself, and in this way frees the faithful 
from the law and all evil. Therefore these are the special 
benefits of Christ, that he teaches the law and performs 
miracles, for which he did not actually come. For the 
prophets and especially the apostles performed greater 
miracles than Christ Himself, John 14:12. 

(49) Since Christ overcame the law in his own 
person, it necessarily follows that he is God by nature. 
For no one, be he man or angel, is above the law, but 
God alone. But Christ is above the law, because he 
overcame it and killed it, so he is the Son of God and 
God by nature. 

If you grasp Christ in this way, as Paul depicts him 
here, you will not err nor be put to shame. Then you will 
also be able to judge easily about all classes, about the 
religion and the services in the whole world. But if this 
right image of Christ is gone or even obscured, 
confusion will surely follow in all things, because the 
natural man cannot judge the law of God. Here the art of 
the worldly wise, the legal scholars and all men fails, 
because the law rules over man, therefore it judges man, 
not man the law. 

(51) Only a Christian has a reliable judgment about 
the law. In what way? That it does not justify. What is it 
kept for?

if it does not make righteous? The final cause (finalis 


causa) why the righteous obey the law is not that they 
attain righteousness before God, because this is 
received by faith alone, but worldly peace, gratitude to 
God, and a good example by which they cause others to 
believe the Gospel 2c. The pope mixed the ceremonies, 
the moral law (moralia) and the faith in such a way that 
he made no distinction between these things, until he 
finally preferred the ceremonies to the moral law, and 
the latter to the faith. 


That we received the filiation. 


That is, the filiation of God. Paul interprets this 
passage Gen. 22, 18: "Through your seed" 2c. 
expansively and gloriously. Above he called the blessing 
of Abraham's seed righteousness, life, the promised 
spirit, redemption from the law, a testament 2c. Here he 
calls it the filiation and the inheritance of eternal life. All 
this comprehends the word "blessing" in itself. For since 
through this blessed seed the curse is taken away, 
which is sin, death 2c., so in its place followed blessing, 
that is, righteousness, life and all good. So you see that 
Paul could have presented a thing richly and adorned, if 
he only wanted to. 

(53) But by what merit have we received this 
blessing, that is, filiation and the inheritance of eternal 
life? By no merit. For what should men be able to merit 
who are shut up under sin, subject to the curse of the 
law, and guilty of eternal death? So we receive it for 
nothing and as unworthy, but not without merit. What 
then is this merit? Not ours, but Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, who was put under the law, not for himself, but for 
us (as Paul said above [Cap. 3:13] that he had become 
a curse for us), who redeemed us who were under the 
law. 

54. therefore we have this adoption only through the 
redemption of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is our 
abundant and eternal merit, whether according to equity 
or according to the law. 


(sive de congruo, sive de condigno). 1) At the same time, 
however, with this filiation conferred by grace, we have 
also received the Holy Spirit, whom God has sent into 
our hearts through His Word, calling out, "Abba, dear 
Father," as follows. 


v. 6. Because you are children, God has 
sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts. 
The Holy Spirit is sent in two ways. In the first church 


he was sent in public (manifesta) and visible form, as he 
descended on Christ at the Jordan in the form of a dove 
on the apostles and other believers in the form of fire. 
This was the first sending of the Holy Spirit, necessary 
in the first church, which had to be established by 


perceptible (manifestis) signs, for the sake of 
unbelievers, as Paul testifies in 1 Cor. 14:22: "Tongues," 
he says, "are not for a sign to believers, but to 
unbelievers." But afterward, when the church was 
gathered together and confirmed with these signs, it was 
not necessary that this visible mission of the Holy Spirit 
should still continue. 

The other consecration is when the Holy Spirit is sent 
into the hearts of believers through the Word, as it is said 
here: "God has sent the Spirit of His Son into your 
hearts" 2c. This happens without visible form, namely 
when we receive warmth and light through the verbal 
word, whereby we become different and new people, a 
new judgment, a new sense and new impulses arise in 
us. This change and the new judgment is not a work of 
human reason or power, but a gift and effect of the Holy 
Spirit, who comes with the preached word, purifies the 
hearts through faith, and produces spiritual stirrings in 
us. 

Therefore, there is a very great difference between 
us and those who persecute the teaching of the gospel 
by force and elevation. We can, by the grace of God, 
from the word 


1) The sense is: Christ is our only merit, may the merit have aname 
as it likes, may it be called As eou“rno or as eouaiAuo. Menius wrong: 
"Therefore we further need no merit, neither 2s oouAruo nor as 
eouaiAuo." Compare ? 58. 


494 Ari- 6ai. II, 189-162. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2395-2398. 


495 





We can conclude and judge with certainty what God's 
will is toward us, as well as about all laws and teachings, 
about our and other people's lives. On the other hand, 
the papists and the enthusiasts cannot make a certain 
judgment about any matter. For these distort and pervert 
the word, and those persecute and blaspheme it; but 
without the word there can be no certain judgment about 
any matter. 

(58) Although it is not evident to the world that we are 
renewed in mind and have the Holy Spirit, yet our 
judgment, speech and confession convince them 
sufficiently that the Holy Spirit and His gifts are in us. For 
before, we could not judge rightly about anything. For we 
did not speak and confess that all that is ours is sin and 


condemnation, that Christ is our only merit according to 


equity and dignity (congrui et condigni), as we do now 
that the sun of truth shines. 

(59) Therefore, we should not be moved by the fact 
that the world, of which we testify that its works are evil, 
judges us to be the most harmful heretics and seditious 
people, destroyers of religion and public peace, 
possessed by the devil, who speaks out of us and 
governs all our actions. Against this wrong judgment of 
the world, this testimony of our conscience should be 
enough for us, by which we know for certain that it is 
God's gift that we not only believe in Jesus Christ, but 
also preach and confess him publicly before the world. 
As we believe with our hearts, so we speak with our 
mouths, according to this word of the Psalm [116:10]: "I 
believe, therefore | speak. But | am greatly afflicted" 2c. 

(60) Then we also practice godly living and avoid sins 
as much as we can. When we sin, we sin not 
deliberately, but out of ignorance, and we are sorry. We 
can fall because the devil pursues us day and night, and 
the remnants of sin still cling to our flesh. Therefore, as 
far as the flesh is concerned, we are sinners even after 
we have received the Holy Spirit, and there is not much 
difference between a Christian and a civilly good person. 
For 


The works of a Christian are, on the face of it, small; he 
carries out his office as his profession requires, governs 
the state, rules his house, builds the field, gives advice, 
shares with his neighbor [of his own] and serves him. A 
carnal man does not hold these works in high esteem, 


but thinks that they are quite ordinary (vulgaria) works 
and of no value, since laymen, even pagans, can do 
them. 

For the world hears nothing of the spirit of God, 
therefore it judges wrongly the works of the godly. The 


abominable (monstrous) superstition of the hypocrites 
and their self-chosen works it not only admires, but also 
considers them a service to God and promotes them at 
great expense. But far from recognizing the works of the 
godly (which are bad and small in appearance, but in 
truth good and pleasing to God, since they are done in 
faith, with a cheerful heart, in obedience and gratitude to 
God) as good works, it censures and even condemns 
them as the highest ungodliness and unrighteousness. 
(62) Therefore the world believes nothing less than 
that we have the Holy Spirit. However, at the time of 
tribulation or the cross, and when one must confess the 
faith (which is the proper and noblest work of believers), 
when one must leave wife, children, goods and life, or 
deny Christ, then it becomes evident that in the power of 
the Holy Spirit we confess the faith, Christ and His Word. 
Therefore we should not doubt that the Holy Spirit 
dwells in us, but we should certainly believe and 
recognize that we are, as Paul says [1 Cor. 6:19], a 
temple of the Holy Spirit. For if anyone feels love for 
God's word, and loves to hear, speak, think, teach 


(dictat), and write about Christ, let him know that this is 
not a work of human will or reason, but a gift of the Holy 
Spirit. For it is impossible for this to happen without the 
Holy Spirit. On the other hand, where there is hatred and 
contempt for the Word, the devil, the god of this world, 
reigns, blinds the hearts of men and holds them captive, 
so that the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ cannot 
shine on them. We see this today 


496 Li-I. "ai. ii, 162-164. 


Exec. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 4, 6. W. vni* 2398-2402. 497 





on the rabble, who cannot be moved by the word, but 
quite certainly despise it, as if it were none of their 
business. 

(64) But those who have any love and desire for the 
Word recognize with gratitude that this attitude is 
infused into them by the Holy Spirit. For we are not born 
with such a mind, nor can we be led by any laws to attain 
it. This change is completely and utterly in the hands of 
the Most High. Therefore, if we like to hear preaching 
about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became man 
for our sake and submitted to the law in order to redeem 
us, then God certainly sends the Holy Spirit into our 
hearts through this sermon and with it. Therefore, it is 
very useful for the godly to know that they have the Holy 
Spirit. 

(65) | say this to refute the harmful doctrine of the 
Sophists and the monks, which they taught and held, 
namely, that no one can know for certain whether he is 
in grace, even if he does good works to the best of his 
ability and lives blamelessly (inculpate). And this 
opinion was generally and everywhere accepted in the 
whole papacy as a main and akind of article of faith, by 
which they completely suppressed the doctrine of faith, 
destroyed the faith, troubled the consciences, took 
Christ away from the church, obscured and denied all 
the benefits and gifts of the Holy Spirit, deprived the true 
worship of God, caused idolatry, contempt and 
blasphemy against God in the hearts of men. For 
whoever doubts God's gracious attitude toward him, and 
does not believe that he is in grace, cannot believe that 
he has forgiveness of sins, that God will take care of 
him, and that he can be saved. 

66 Augustine said rightly and Christianly: He who 
has faith sees it most certainly. To this they say, "No. 
Far be it from me," they say, "to believe that | am in 
grace, that | am holy, that | have the Holy Spirit, even 
though | live holy and do everything. This ungodly 
opinion, on which the entire papacy is based 





You young people should flee and abhor it as the most 
harmful plague, because you have not yet been infected 
by it. We, the elderly, have been raised in it from our 
youth and have absorbed it so much that it is deeply 
ingrained in our hearts. Therefore, it will be as difficult 
for us to unlearn it as to learn the right faith. 

67 We must therefore be absolutely certain that we 
are in grace, that we are pleasing to God for Christ's 
sake, that we have the Holy Spirit. For "he that hath not 
the Spirit of Christ is not his" [Rom. 8:9]. Then also all 
things are sin which he that thinketh, speaketh, and 
doeth, who is in doubt; for all things "that proceed not 
from faith are sin." Therefore, whether you are a minister 
of the Word or govern the state, you should certainly 
believe that your office is pleasing to God. But you will 
never be able to come to this certain conviction if you do 
not have the Holy Spirit. 

68 But you say: | do not doubt that my office pleases 
God, for it is God's order, but | doubt whether the person 
pleases Him. Here we must consult theology, which is 
mainly concerned with making us certain that not only 
the office a person holds, but also the person himself is 
pleasing to God. For the person is baptized, believes in 
Christ, is cleansed from all sins by his blood, lives in the 
fellowship of the church; likewise, he not only loves the 
right doctrine of the Word, but also rejoices greatly that 
it is spread and the number of believers is increased; on 
the other hand, he hates the pope and all the fanatics 
with their ungodly doctrine, according to the words [Ps. 
119, 113]: "I hate the fanatics and love your law." 

(69) Therefore, we should certainly consider that not 
only our ministry, but also our person is pleasing to God. 
For everything that this person says, does, thinks 
outside of his office (privately) is pleasing to God, not for 
our sake, of course, but for the sake of Christ, whom we 
believe was put under the law for us. But we are quite 
sure that Christ pleases God, that he is holy 2c. 
Inasmuch then as Christ pleases God and we cling to 
him, we also please God and are holy.

499 





Although sin still clings to our flesh and we also fall 
daily, grace is richer and more powerful than sin. The 
mercy and truth of the Lord reigns over us forever [Ps. 
117:2]. Therefore, sin cannot frighten us or make us 
doubtful about the grace of God in us. For Christ, the 


mightiest hero (gigas), has abolished the law, 
condemned sin, and done away with death and all evil. 
As long as he is at the right hand of God and represents 
us, we cannot doubt the grace of God toward us. 

Then God has also sent the Spirit of His Son into our 
hearts, as Paul says here. But Christ is quite sure in his 
spirit that he pleases God 2c. Therefore we also, since 
we have the same Spirit of Christ, must be sure that we 
stand in grace, 2c., for his sake, who is sure of it. Let this 
be said of the inward testimony, by which the heart must 
be quite sure that it is in grace and has the Holy Spirit. 

The outward signs are, as | said above, to hear gladly 
of Christ, to teach, to give thanks, to praise, to confess 
him, even at the cost of life and limb; then, according to 
his calling, to do his work with all his might, in faith, with 
gladness, 2c. not to take pleasure in sins, not to take 
hold of another's office, but to wait for his own, to help 
the needy brother, to comfort the afflicted 2c. By these 


signs, if they follow faith (a posteriori), we become 
certain and sure that we are in grace. The wicked also 
imagine that they have these signs, but they have none 


(nihil minus habent). 

From this it is sufficiently obvious that the pope with 
his teaching only confuses the consciences and finally 
leads them into despair, because he not only teaches, 
but even commands to be uncertain 2c. Therefore, as 
the Psalm [5:10] says, "in his mouth there is nothing 
certain," and elsewhere [Ps. 10:7] it is said, "His tongue 
causes trouble and labor." 

But here we see how great the weakness of faith still 
is among the godly. 





For if we could hold on to the fact that we are in grace, 
that our sins are forgiven, that we have the Spirit of 
Christ, that we are children of God, then we would truly 
be joyful and grateful to God for this unspeakable gift. 
But because we feel the opposite emotions, fear, doubt, 
sadness, etc., we do not dare to hold this as certain. 
Indeed, conscience judges it to be great presumption 
and arrogance to presume upon this honor. This is why 
this thing is only properly understood when it is put into 
practice, for it is never learned without experience. 

(75) Therefore, let each one get into the habit of 
believing that he is in grace and that his person and 
works are pleasing to God. But when he feels that he 
doubts, he exercises himself in faith and fights against 
doubt, and strives to attain certainty, so that he can say: 
| know that | am acceptable to God, that | have the Holy 
Spirit, not because of my worthiness or merit, but 
because of Christ, who for our sake submitted to the law 
and bore the sins of the world. In Him | believe. If lama 
sinner and err, he is righteous and cannot err. Then | 
love to hear, read, sing and write about him, and desire 
nothing so much as that his gospel may be made known 
to the world and that many may be converted. 

This is a certain testimony that the Holy Spirit is there. 
For this does not happen in the heart through human 
powers, nor is it obtained through any kind of exercise 
or effort, but it is given to us through Christ, who first 
justifies us through his (sui) knowledge, then creates a 
pure heart, brings forth new impulses, and gives the 
certainty by which we certainly believe that we please 
the Father for Christ's sake, likewise gives us a certain 
judgment by which we now approve of that of which we 
knew nothing before or completely despised it. 

We must therefore strive more and more every day 
to move from uncertainty to certainty, and strive to 
overcome this most harmful delusion (that man is a 


500 Li-i. Kai. Il, 167-169. Explanation of Galatians 4, 6. W. VIII, 240S-2408. 


We have to doubt the grace of God), who has possessed 


the whole world (devoravit), from the bottom up. For if 
we doubt whether we celebrate in grace, whether we 
please God for Christ's sake, we deny that Christ has 
redeemed us, deny all His benefits. You young people 
can easily take hold of the pure teaching of the gospel 
and avoid that harmful delusion, because you have not 
yet been infected by it. 


He cried out: Abba, dear Father! 


Paul could have said: God has sent the Spirit of His 
Son into our hearts, who cries out: Abba, dear Father! 
but intentionally he says: "who cries out" to indicate the 
challenge of the Christian who is still weak and weak in 
faith. Rom. 8, 26. He calls this crying "an inexpressible 
groaning". "The same also the Spirit helpeth up our 
weakness," he says. "For we do not know what we ought 
to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself represents 
us in the best way with inexpressible groaning. "2c. 

It is a great comfort that Paul says that the Spirit of 
Christ is sent by God into our hearts to cry out: Abba, 
dear Father 2c.; likewise Rom. 8, 26. that he helps our 
weakness and represents us with unspeakable 
groaning. Whoever believed this would not fall away in 
any tribulation, no matter how great it might be. But 
many things hinder this faith. First, that our hearts are 
born in sins, then that this evil clings to us by nature 


(ingenitum est), that we doubt God's gracious will 
toward us, not thinking with certainty that we please God 
2c. Moreover, our adversary, the devil, goes about, 
emitting a terrible roar and saying: You are a sinner, 
therefore God is angry with you and will condemn you 
eternally. 

(80) Against this exceedingly great and unbearable 
clamor, we have absolutely nothing by which we can 
raise ourselves up and sustain ourselves, but the mere 
word, which holds Christ up to us as the victor over sin, 
death and all evil. But to firmly cling to this in this struggle 
and fear of conscience is effort, it is work. Then Christ is 
not perceived with any of our senses; for 





501 


we do not see him, our heart does not feel his presence 
and help in the temptation, yes, then Christ seems to be 
angry with us and to leave us. Then, in temptation, man 
feels the power of sin, the weakness of the flesh, doubt, 
he feels the fiery darts of the devil, the terror of death, he 
feels the wrath and judgment of God. All this raises a 
very strong and terrible cry against us, so that there 
seems to be nothing left but despair and eternal death. 
But in the midst of these terrors of the law, thundering 


of sin, shaking (CONCUSSiONnIbUS) of death and roaring 
of the devil, the Holy Spirit begins (says Paul) to cry out 
in our heart: Abba, dear Father! And his cry is far 


stronger and drowns out (perrumpit) the exceedingly 
strong and terrifying cry of the law, sin, death, the devil 
2c., penetrates through clouds and sky and reaches the 
ears of God 2c. 

With these words Paul shows that there is still 
weakness in the godly. He teaches the same thing in 
Rom. 8, 26, when he says: "The Spirit helps our 
weakness." Since we strongly feel the opposite, that is, 
since we feel more that God is angry with us than that 
He is merciful to us, the Holy Spirit is sent into our hearts, 
who not only sighs and cries out, but cries out most 
strongly: Abba, dear Father! and represents us 
according to the will of God with inexpressible groaning. 
In what way? 

In serious terror and struggle of conscience we take 
hold of Christ and believe that he is our Savior. But then 
the law terrifies us exceedingly, and sin causes us 
consternation; the devil also challenges us with all his 
attacks and fiery darts, and strives with all his strength 
to snatch Christ from us and to take away all our comfort. 
Then there is little lack of our succumbing and despair. 
For then we are a crushed reed and a smoldering wick 
[Matth. 12, 20]. But in the meantime, the Holy Spirit helps 
our weakness and represents us with inexpressible 
groaning and "bears witness to our spirit that we are 
God's 


502 Lri. Kai. Il, 169-172. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2408-2412. 


Children are". In this way the mind is raised up in terror, 
sighs to its Savior and High Priest Jesus Christ, 
overcomes the weakness of the flesh and receives 
comfort again, saying: Abba, dear Father! Now this 
groaning, which we hardly feel, Paul calls a cry and an 
inexpressible groaning, which fills heaven and earth. 
Then he also calls it a crying and groaning of the Spirit, 
because the Holy Spirit, when we are weak and 
challenged, produces this crying in our heart. 

(84) However great and terrible the cries of the law, 
sin, and the devil may be against us, so that they seem 
to fill the whole heaven and earth and far drown out the 
groaning of our hearts, they cannot harm us. For the 
more these our enemies persist, accuse, and afflict us 
with their cries, the more we groan and take hold of 
Christ, call upon him with heart and mouth, cling to him, 
and believe that he was put under the law for us, that he 
might redeem us from the curse of the law, and so 
destroy sin and death. And having thus taken hold of 
Christ in faith, we cry out through him: Abba, dear Father! 
and this cry of ours is far stronger than the cry of the devil 
2c. 

But we do not believe that this groaning, which we 
bring before God in this terror, in this weakness of ours, 
is a cry, that we hardly realize that it is a groaning. For 
our faith, which sighs to Christ in this way in the midst of 
our temptation, is very weak as far as our feelings are 
concerned. That is why we do not hear this cry. We have 
only the Word; when we take hold of it in this struggle, 
we breathe a little and sigh. And this our sighing we feel 
to some extent, but a cry we do not hear. But he, says 
Paul, who searches the hearts, understands what the 
Spirit desires 2c. For this investigator of hearts, this 
groaning, which seems to us to be small, is the strongest 
cry and an inexpressible groaning, against which the 
exceedingly strong and horrible roar of the law, of sin, of 
death, of the devil, of hell are nothing at all and cannot 
be heard. Dar 


503 


um Paul does not call the groaning of a sorrowful 
Christian heart a cry and an inexpressible groaning of 
the spirit in vain. For it fills the whole heaven and cries 
so strongly that the angels make believe that they hear 
nothing else than this cry everywhere. 

But we feel just the opposite. It does not seem to us 
that this weak sigh of ours can penetrate through the 
clouds in such a way that it should be heard in heaven 
by God and the angels alone, yes, we think, especially 
as long as the temptation lasts, that the devil will roar 
horribly against us, that heaven will crack, the earth will 
shake, that everything will collapse, that all creatures are 
threatened with disaster, that hell will rise up and want to 
devour us. This is what we feel in our hearts, these 
horrible sounds, this terrifying sight we hear and see. 
And this is what Paul says in 2 Cor. 12, 9, that the power 
of Christ becomes mighty in our weakness. For Christ is 
then in truth omnipotent, then He truly reigns and 
triumphs in us when we are so weak that we can hardly 
sigh. But Paul says that this groaning is a very strong cry 
in the ears of God, which fills the whole heaven and 
earth. 

In the parable of the unjust judge, Christ also calls 
this sighing of a godly heart a cry, and such a cry that 
continually cries out to God day and night, saying: "Hear 
what the unjust judge says. But should not GOD also 
save His elect who cry out to Him day and night, and 
should have patience over them? | tell you, he will save 
them in a short time." 

Today, with so much persecution and opposition from 
the pope, tyrants, and the spirits of the swarm, who 
challenge us on the right and on the left, we can do 
nothing but let out such sighs, and these have been our 
heavy weapons and tools of war, with which we have 
thwarted the attacks of the adversaries for so many 
years, with which we have begun to destroy the kingdom 
of the Antichrist. For these sighs will 1) Chri-

stum to hasten the day of his coming in glory, when he 
will abolish all principalities, power and authority, and put 
all enemies under his feet, amen. 

(89) Similarly, in Exodus 14:15, the Lord spoke to 
Moses at the Red Sea and said, "Why are you crying out 
to me? Moses certainly did not cry out, but trembled and 
almost despaired, for he was in the greatest fear. 
Unbelief seemed to rule in him, not faith. For he saw that 
the people of Israel were so enclosed by mountains, the 
army of Egypt and the sea that they had nowhere to 
escape. Here Moses did not even dare to shout, how 
could he have shouted? Therefore, we must not judge 
according to the feelings of our heart, but according to 
the word of God, which teaches that the Holy Spirit is 
given to the afflicted, the brokenhearted, the despairing 
2c. so that he may straighten them out and comfort 
them, so that they may not succumb to temptations and 
all misfortunes, but overcome them, but not without 
great fear and effort. 

The papists dreamed that the saints had the Holy 
Spirit in such a way that they never felt or had a 
challenge. They speak of the Holy Spirit only according 
to their thoughts (speculative), as do the enthusiasts 
today. But Paul says that the power of Christ is mighty 
in our weakness, likewise that the Holy Spirit helps our 
weakness and represents us with unspeakable groaning 
2c. So then we are most in need of the help and comfort 
of the Holy Spirit, then He is most with us, when our 
inability is greatest and we are closest to despair. When 
someone endures adversity with strong and cheerful 
courage, the Holy Spirit has already done his work in 
him. But in those the Holy Spirit actually does his work, 
who are terrified and, as the Psalm [9:14] says, have 
come close to "the gates of death", as | have already 
said about Moses, who saw death before his eyes in the 
water, and wherever he turned his gaze. 

91. Moses was thus in the highest fear and despair 
and no doubt felt 





505 


in his heart an exceedingly strong cry of the devil against 
him, who said: All this people will perish today, for they 
have nowhere to escape. You alone are the author of 
this exceedingly great evil, for you led the people out of 
Egypt. In addition, there was the cry of the people, who 
said [Ex. 14:11, 12]: "Were there not graves in Egypt, 
that you had to take us away, that we should die in the 
wilderness? Would it not have been better for us to serve 
the Egyptians, than that we should die here miserably in 
the wilderness?" Then the Holy Spirit was not merely in 
the thoughts of Moses (speculative in Moses), but in 
fact represented him with inexpressible groaning, so that 
he groaned again to God and said: "Lord, at your 
command | have carried out the people, therefore help. 
This groaning is called a cry in the Scriptures. 

| have treated this more extensively in order to show 
clearly what the office of the Holy Spirit is and when He 
exercises it primarily. 

Therefore, we should not judge this matter in any way 
according to our feelings or according to the cries of the 
law, of sin, of the devil 2c. If we want to follow our 
feelings and believe this cry, then we must judge that we 
are forsaken by all help of the Holy Spirit and completely 
rejected from the face of God. 

94. But rather, we should then remember that Paul 
says: the Spirit helps our weakness 2c., likewise, he 
cries out: Abba, dear Father, that is, if he causes even 
the slightest groan or sighing of the heart, as it seems to 
us, this is nevertheless a very great cry and an 
inexpressible groaning before God. Therefore, in all your 
temptation and weakness, cling only to Christ and sigh. 
He gives the Holy Spirit, who cries out: Abba, dear 
Father! And this little groaning is an exceedingly strong 
cry in the ears of God, and it fills heaven and earth in 
such a way that God hears nothing else besides it; 
moreover, it drowns out all cries that may be raised 
against us from any other side. 

95 You must also notice that Paul says that the Spirit 
represents us in temptation. 


506 Lri. 6"1. ii, 174-176. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2415-2418. 


507 





not with many words or long prayers, but only with 
sighing, and that with inexpressible sighing, that he also 
does not raise a strong cry with tears and say: God, have 
mercy on me 2c., but that he only brings forth the little 
word by which the crying and sighing is expressed, 
namely: Oh Father! This is indeed a very short word, but 
it comprehends everything in itself. Not the mouth, but 
the heart speaks in this way: Although | am afraid on 
every side, and seem to be abandoned and completely 
rejected by you, yet | am your child, you are my Father 
for Christ's sake, | am loved for the sake of the Beloved. 
Therefore, when the little word "Father" is spoken in the 


heart, as it is by its very nature (formaliter), there is an 
eloquence in it such as Demosthenes, Cicero, and all the 
greatest orators who have ever been in the world could 
not have expressed. This thing is not expressed by 
words, but by sighs, which cannot be expressed by all 
the words of all orators, because they are inexpressible. 

With many words | have indicated that a Christian 
man must certainly believe that he is in the grace of God 
and has the cry of the Holy Spirit in his heart. | have done 
this so that we may learn to absolutely reject the 
exceedingly pernicious delusion of the whole realm of the 
pope, namely, that he has taught that a man must be 
uncertain about the grace of God toward him. If this 
delusion is maintained, Christ is of no use at all. For 
whoever doubts God's grace toward him must 
necessarily doubt God's promises, consequently also 
God's gracious will, Christ's benefits, that he was born for 
us, suffered, died and rose again 2c. But there is no 
greater blasphemy against God than to deny His 
promises, to deny God Himself and Christ 2c. 

Therefore, it has not only been an exceedingly great 
foolishness, but also the utmost impiety, that the monks 
have treated the young people of both sexes with such 
great 


1) Erlanger: anZustas instead of antzustias. 





They were zealous in attracting people to the 


monasteries, to the religiones and holy orders, as they 
called them, as the most certain state of blessedness, 
and yet afterward ordered those whom they had thus 
attracted to doubt the grace of God. 

Then the pope called upon the entire human race to 
obey the holy Roman church, as if by doing so they 
would enter into a holy state in which they could certainly 
attain blessedness, after which he _ nevertheless 
commanded those who rendered such obedience to 
doubt [their blessedness] by his laws. Thus the kingdom 
of Antichrist first boasts and exalts the holiness of its 
laws, orders, rules 2c., and promises eternal life with 
certainty to those who keep them, but afterwards, when 
these quite miserable people have long martyred their 
bodies with vigils, fasts 2c. according to the prescription 
of their human statutes, they have this gain from it, that 
they do not know whether this their obedience pleases 
God or not. Thus, Satan has played his game of 
murdering souls in a terrifying way through the pope, and 
that is why the pope's office is a real torture chamber of 
consciences and the devil's real kingdom. 

In order to establish and strengthen this harmful error, 
they have used the saying of Solomon, Cap. 9, 1: "There 
are the righteous and the wise, and their works are in the 
hand of God, and yet man does not know whether he is 
worthy of love or hatred2. This saying some understand 
by the future, others by the present hatred of God, but 
both do not understand Solomon, who at this point does 
not at all say what they dream. Next, the whole of 
Scripture deals mainly with the fact that we should not 
doubt, but certainly hope, trust and believe that God is 
merciful, kind, patient, does not lie and deceive, but is 
faithful and true, who keeps his promises, yes, who has 
now fulfilled what he promised by giving his only 
begotten Son to die for our sins, "so that all who believe 
in him may not be lost. 


2) According to Luther's translation, Menius cites this saying in the 
Bible, which, however, does not fit into the context. 


508 Lri. 6 "I. Il, 176-179. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 4, 6. W. VIII, 2418-2422. 


509 





but have eternal life". There can certainly be no doubt 
that God is reconciled and gracious to us from the heart, 
that God's hatred and wrath are gone, since He sent His 
Son to die for us sinners. 

(100) Although the whole Gospel reproaches this 
everywhere and frequently inculcates it, it has not 
availed. This few sayings of Solomon, [however] 
misunderstood, have been more valid, especially among 


those who pretend to great devotion (devotarios), and 


the monks of stricter religious life (religionis), than all 
the promises and consolations of the whole Scripture, 
nay, than Christ himself. They have thus misused the 
Scriptures to their own destruction and suffered the just 
punishment for their contempt of the Scriptures and 
neglect of the Gospel. 

(101) It is useful that we know this, first, because the 
papists nowadays adorn themselves as if they had never 
committed anything evil; therefore they must be 
convicted with their own abominations, which they have 
spread without number in the world, as their own books 
testify, of which there are still innumerable that concern 
this matter; secondly, so that we may be made certain 
that we have the pure and right doctrine of the Gospel; 
this certainty the papacy cannot possibly boast of. For 
even if all things were right in it, this abomination 
(monstrum), that one should be uncertain [of his state of 
grace], is greater than all abominations. And even 
though it is evident that they, as the enemies of Christ, 
teach what is uncertain, for they command the 
consciences to doubt, they are nevertheless so full of 
satanic rage that they quite certainly condemn us, who 
deviate from them and teach what is certain, as heretics 
and kill us, as if they were completely certain of their 
doctrine. 

Therefore, let us give thanks to God that we are freed 
from this abomination of uncertainty, and now we can 
surely believe that the Holy Spirit cries out in our hearts 
and brings an unspeakable groaning before God. And 
this is our foundation: the Gospel does not call us to look 
at our good works (benefacta) and our perfection, but to 
look at God Himself, who gives the promise, and at 
Christ Himself, our Mediator. On the other hand, the 
Pope commands that one should not look at God who 
gives the promise, not at Christ, 





the high priest, but our works and merits. Doubt and 
despair inevitably follow, but on our side there is certainty 
and joy in the Holy Spirit, because | cling to God, who 
cannot lie. For he says: Behold, | give my Son to die, that 
by his blood he may redeem you from sin and death. | 
cannot doubt this unless | want to deny God completely. 

And this is the reason that our theology is certain, 
because it makes us not see from ourselves, but bases 
us on what is outside of us, that we do not rely on our 
powers, conscience, feelings, person and works, but rely 
on what is outside of us, that is, on the promise and truth 
of God, which cannot be lacking. This the pope does not 
know, that is why he chats so ungodly with his 


nonsensical followers (furiiS), that no one knows, not 
even the righteous and the wise, whether he is worthy of 
love [or hate] 2c. Rather, if they are righteous and wise, 
they truly know that they are loved by God, or they are 
not righteous and wise. 

Furthermore, this saying of Solomon does not speak 
of God's hatred or benevolence toward men, but it is a 


worldly (politica) saying that punishes the ingratitude of 
men. For the ingratitude of the world is so great that it 
often pays evil tribute to those who have done well for it, 
and sometimes treats them with complete iniquity. On 
the other hand, it exalts the bad guys and pays them 
honor. Thus David, a holy man and a very good king, 
was driven out of his kingdom, the prophets, Christ, the 
apostles were killed; yes, also the histories of all the 
heathen testify that many men, who have done very well 
for the fatherland, have been sent into exile by their own 
fellow citizens, and have lived miserably there, that some 
have also perished ignominiously in prison. 

Therefore, Solomon is not speaking here of the 
conscience that deals with God, or of the gracious 
disposition and judgment of God, but of the judgment 
and expression of the wills of men among themselves, 
as 


510 Lli. 6ai. Il, 17S-18I. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2422-2425. 


511 





whether he wanted to say: There are many wise and just 
people through whom God works much good and brings 
peace to people, but far from people acknowledging this, 
they often repay such men for their best good deeds with 
the most shameful thanks. Therefore, no matter how well 
aman has done, he does not know whether his diligence 
and faithfulness will earn him hatred or favor from men. 

106 Thus, today we too, thinking that we would find 
favor with our Germans for preaching to them the gospel 
of peace, life and eternal bliss, find instead of favor the 
most bitter hatred. In the beginning, our teaching 
pleased many, and they eagerly accepted it. We thought 
that they would become friends and brothers who would 
plant this doctrine with us in the same spirit and spread 
it to others: But now we learn that they are false brethren 
and our worst enemies, who spread error, and 
counterfeit and overthrow what we teach rightly and 
Christianly, and excite the worst vexations in the 
churches. Therefore, let no one who performs his 
ministry godly and faithfully, be he in whatever state he 
may, and has to accept the ingratitude and hatred of men 
for his good deeds, harden himself to death over it, but 
let him say with Christ [Ps. 25:19, Jn. 15:25], "They hate 
me without a cause," likewise [Ps. 109:4, according to 
the Vulgate], "For that they should love me, they were 
against me; but | prayed.” 

Thus, by this ungodly teaching, that he makes people 
doubt whether God is gracious to them, the pope has 
taken God and all promises away from the church, 
obscured the benefits of Christ, and taken away the 
whole gospel. This damage must inevitably follow, 
because people do not rely on God's promise, but on 
their works and merits. Where this happens, it is 
impossible for man to be certain of God's gracious 
disposition, but he must always be in doubt about it and 
finally despair. For one cannot see anywhere else than 
in God's words what God wants and what pleases Him. 
This makes us certain that God will reject all anger and 
hatred against 





He gave His only begotten Son for our sins 2c. Likewise, 
the sacraments, the office of the keys 2c. make us 
certain that God would not have given us if He did not 
love us. With innumerable testimonies of the kind in 
which He assures us of His gracious disposition, God 
has showered us. 

(108) Therefore, since this harmful doctrine of 
uncertainty, which has infected the whole Church of the 
Pope, has come to an end, we should certainly believe 
that God is gracious to us, that we please Him, and that 
He takes care of us for the sake of Christ, that we have 
the Holy Spirit to represent us with cries and 
inexpressible groans. 

But this crying and groaning is in its proper nature 
(formaliter), that you call upon God in anguish, not as a 
tyrant, not as an angry judge or tormentor, but as a 
Father, even if this groaning should be so small and 
hidden that one can hardly become aware of it. For in 
real terror, when the conscience fights with the judgment 
of God, it does not call God a father, but an unjust, angry 
and cruel tyrant and judge, and this cry, which Satan 
raises in the heart, is far stronger than the cry of the 
spirit, and is felt most strongly. For it then seems to us 
as if God has abandoned us and wants to cast us into 
hell. 

Thus the saints often lament in the Psalms [Ps. 31, 
23]: "| am cast out from the eyes of God", likewise [v. 13]: 
"| have become like a broken vessel" 2c. This, of course, 
is not the sighing that says: Dear Father, but a roar that 
hatred of God emits, crying out violently: You severe 
judge, you cruel tormentor 2c. Here it is time for you to 
turn your eyes away from the law, from your works, from 
what the conscience feels, and in faith take hold of the 
promise, that is, the word of grace and life, which in turn 
directs the conscience to begin to groan and say: "As 
much as the law accuses me, sin and death terrify me, 
yet you promise, O God, grace, righteousness, and 
eternal life for 


512 Lri. Kai. Il, 181-183. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 4, 6. 7. 


Christ's sake; and so the promise brings about the 
groaning that cries out: Abba, dear Father! 
| do not dislike that some in their interpretation point 


out (expound) that one word is Greek, the other is 
Hebrew, and that Paul intentionally wanted to use both 
to indicate the twofold church, both gathered from 
Gentiles and Jews, and that although Gentiles and Jews 
call God their Father in different languages, both have 
one and the same groaning, because both cry out: Abba, 
dear Father! 


V. 7. So now here is no longer a servant, but vain 
children. 


This is an exclamation (epiphonema) and a 


conclusion (conclusio), as if to say: If this is established, 
that through the Gospel we have received the Spirit by 
whom we cry out: Abba, dear Father! then it is certainly 
established in heaven that there is no longer bondage, 


but only freedom, gracious acceptance (adoptio) and 
filiation. Who generates these? This groaning. In what 
way? The Father offers me his grace in his promise and 
that he wants to be my father; so it only remains that | 
also accept this. This happens when | cry out in such 
groaning and with a childlike heart agree with this word: 
"Dear Father!" Then father and child come together, and 
a marriage vow is made without all pomp and splendor, 
that is, nothing at all is added, no law, no work is required 
here (for what could a man do in this terror and the 
terrible darkness of the temptations?), here is only the 
Father who gives the promise and calls me his child for 
Christ's sake, who is put under the law 2c., and | who 
accept it and answer by this groaning, saying, "Dear 
Father!" Here, then, nothing is demanded, but there is 
only this sighing of the child, which draws confidence in 
the tribulation, and says, Thou givest me the promise, 
and callest me thy child for Christ's sake; and | accept 
this, and call thee Father. This is, of course, "becoming 
children" without works. This cannot be understood 
without experience. 


513 


Here Paul uses the word "servant" in a different way 
than in the third chapter, v. 28, where he says: "Here is 
no servant nor free" 2c. Here he speaks of a servant of 
the law, subject to the law, as he said just before, v. 3. 
"We were captives under the outward statutes." 
Therefore, in Paul's opinion, to be a "servant" in this 
passage is to be guilty of the law and to be captive under 
the law, under the wrath of God and death; to regard 
God, not as a merciful Father, but as a tormentor, 
enemy, and tyrant. This is in truth living in bondage and 
Babylonian captivity and being cruelly martyred in it. For 
the law does not make free from sin and death, but 
reveals sin and increases it and incites wrath. This 
bondage, he says, has ceased, oppresses and grieves 
us no more. 

114 Paul speaks as of a person (in concreto): "Here 
can be no more servant." But this saying becomes 
somewhat clearer if instead of the person we put the 
term derived from it (in abstracto), in this way: There can 
be no bondage in Christ, but only filiation. For when faith 
comes, bondage ceases, as he also Cap. 3, 28. 

But if we are children through the Spirit of Christ, who 
cries in our hearts, "Abba, dear Father! we are children 
and no longer servants, then it certainly follows that we 
are freed not only from the abominations of the pope and 
from the predatory human statutes, but also from all the 
dominion and rights that the law of God has over us. 
Therefore, we must in no way allow the law to rule in our 
conscience, much less the pope with his futile threats 
and terrors. He does roar like a lion: that all who do not 
obey his laws would incur the wrath of Almighty God and 
of the holy apostles, but Paul fortifies and comforts us 
against this roar, because he says: "Here is no servant", 
but a freeman. 

116. take this comfort in faith, and say: law, your 
tyranny cannot be on the throne where Christ my Lord 
sits. 


514 .yri. 0, 183-185. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. VIII, 2428-2431. 


Instead of having. Here | do not hear you (much less, O 
Antichrist, do | hear your abominations), for | am free and 
a child who need not be subject to bondage or servile 
laws. 

Let Moses (much less the pope) with his laws not 
enter the bridegroom's bed to rest there, that is, to reign 
in the conscience, which Christ freed from the law so that 
it would not be subject to bondage. The servants with the 
donkey are to remain in the valley, but Isaac is to go up 
the mountain with his father Abraham, that is, the law is 
to rule over the body and the old man, but he is to be 
under the law and have a burden laid upon him, he is to 
be tormented and afflicted; Let the law dictate to him 
what he shall do, what he shall suffer, and how he shall 
walk among men, but let it not defile the bridal bed in 
which Christ alone is to rest and sleep, that is, let it not 
trouble the conscience. For the conscience alone should 
live with Christ, his bridegroom, in the kingdom of 
freedom and filiation. 

If then, he says, you cry out through the Spirit of 
Christ, "Abba, Father," then you are certainly no longer 
servants, but free and children, so you are without law, 
without sin, without death, that is, you are blessed and 
have no more evil. Therefore, childship brings with it the 
eternal kingdom and the whole heavenly inheritance. 

(119) How great and glorious this gift is, the human 
mind cannot even comprehend in this life, much less 
express. Meanwhile, we see this in a dark word; we have 
this weak sighing and little faith, which is based only on 
the preaching and the sound of the voice of Christ, who 
gives us his promises. Therefore, according to our 


feeling, the greatness and glory of this gift (feS ista) is 
only the center, but in itself it is an exceedingly great and 
infinite circle. 

Thus a Christian has in himself a good (rem), which 
in itself is exceedingly great and immeasurable, but 
according to his seeing and feeling is very small and 
narrowly circumscribed. 

121 Therefore, we must measure this good, not 
according to human reason and feeling, 





515 


but according to another area (CifculO), namely the 
promise of GOD. As God is infinite, so is His promise 
infinite, even though in the meantime [in this life] it is 


enclosed in such a narrow circle (Nas angustias) and, 
that | say so, in the word that forms the center (verbum 


centrale). So now we see the center, one day we will 
also see the circumcircle. Therefore, nothing is left now 
that could accuse, frighten and bind the conscience. For 
there is no longer bondage, but filiation, which brings us 
not only freedom from the law, from sin and death, but 
also the inheritance of eternal life, as follows: 


But if they are children, they are also 
heirs of God through Christ. 


For whoever is a child must also be an heir. For by 
the very fact that he is born, he has the right (meretur) to 
be heir. No work, no merit procures him the inheritance, 
but only the birth. And so the inheritance is conferred on 


him in a merely passive, non-active way, that is, that 


he is born, not that he acquires (gignere), not that he 
works, not that he provides 2c., makes him an heir. For 
the fact that he is born, he does nothing, but behaves 
only suffering. 

Therefore, it is only in suffering, not in action, that we 
attain these eternal goods, forgiveness of sins, 
righteousness, the glory of the resurrection and eternal 
life. There is nothing else that can help us here, but only 
faith takes hold of the promise that is offered. Just as a 
child in the world and in the house becomes an heir only 
by being born, so here faith alone makes children of 
God, who are born from the Word, which is the divine 
mother, in whom we are conceived, carried, born, raised 
up [Is. 46:3]. So by this birth, by this suffering behavior, 
in which we suffer to become and be formed into a new 
creature through faith in the Word, we become 
Christians, children and heirs of GOD through Christ. But 
if we are heirs, we are free from death, devil 2c., and 
have righteousness and eternal life. 


516 Lri. "-U. Il, 185-188. Explanation of Galatians 4, 7. W. VIII, 2431-2435. 


517 





But this is beyond all human comprehension, that he 
says: "Heirs", not of a very rich and powerful king, not of 
the emperor, not of the world, but of the almighty God, 
the creator of all things. Therefore this inheritance of 
ours, as Paul elsewhere Cor. 9, 15.] also says, is 
ineffable. And if someone with certain and constant faith 
could believe and understand the greatness of the good 
that he is a child and heir of God, he would consider all 
the power and treasures in all the kingdoms of the world 
as filth and dung compared to his heavenly inheritance. 
Everything that the world has in high and glorious things 
would be disgusting to him, and the greater the world's 
glory and splendor, the more he would be disgusted with 
it: in short, everything that the world admires and praises 
highly would be ugly and void in his eyes. For what is 
the whole world with its power, wealth and glory 
compared to God, whose heir and child he is? 

After that, he would also have a heartfelt desire, like 
Paul, to depart and be with Christ, and nothing could be 
better for him than an early death, which he would seize 
as if it were the most joyful peace. For he would know 
that death would be the end of all his evil, and through it 
he would attain to his inheritance. 2c. Yes, the man who 
believed this completely would not remain alive long, but 
would be immediately dissolved with excessive joy. 

But the law in the members, which is contrary to the 
law of the mind, does not make faith perfect. Therefore 
we need the help and comfort of the Holy Spirit, who 
represents us in our distresses with inexpressible 
groaning, as was said above. Sin still clings to the flesh, 
which continually troubles the conscience and thus 
hinders faith, so that we cannot fully enjoy looking at and 
desiring these eternal treasures that God has given us 
through Christ. Since even Paul felt this struggle of the 
flesh against the spirit, he exclaimed [Rom. 7, 24.]: "I 
wretched man, who will deliver me from the body of this 
death?" He accuses his body, which after all he should 
have loved, with a 





exceedingly evil name, calling it his death, as if to say: 
My body troubles and weighs me down more than death 
itself. For it also clouded this joy of the spirit for him; he 
did not always have lovely and pleasant thoughts of the 
future heavenly inheritance, but also felt sadness of 
spirit, horror 2c. 

From this it is sufficiently evident how difficult faith is, 
which is not easily and quickly learned and grasped, as 
the full and weary spirits dream, who devour at once 
everything contained in the Scriptures in one bite. The 
weakness and the struggle of the flesh with the spirit in 
the saints is sufficient proof of how small faith still is in 
them. For perfect faith would soon produce perfect 
contempt and disdain for this temporal life. 

If we could understand and be certain that God is our 
Father, and we are His children and heirs, then the world 
would truly become small to us, with all its glory, 
righteousness, wisdom, power, with all its royal crowns, 
treasures, pleasures 2c. We would not be so anxious 
about our livelinood, we would not be so attached to 
earthly things with our hearts, and have good courage 
when they are there, but when they are not there, let our 
courage sink and despair, but we would do everything in 
the highest love, humility and patience (of which the 
heretics also boast, but in truth no one is more cruel, no 
one more arrogant, no one more impatient than they). 
Now we do the opposite, for the flesh is still strong, but 
faith is small and the spirit weak. Therefore Paul rightly 
says that in this life we have only the firstfruits of the 
Spirit, but there we will have it completely. 


Through Christ. 


Paul always has Christ in his mouth, he cannot forget 
him. For he foresaw that nothing would be less known in 
the world than Christ and his gospel, even among those 
who professed to be Christians. That is why he 
constantly teaches about him and puts him before us, 
and as often as he speaks of grace, righteousness, 


518 Lri. 6ai. Il, 188-190. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2435-2442. 


519 





He always adds "in Christ" or "through Christ" to the 
promise, filiation and inheritance. Incidentally (obliquely), 
he also refers to the law, as if he wanted to say: This can 
be given to us neither by the law nor by the works of the 
law (much less by our powers or works of human 
statutes), but only through Christ. 


V. 8. 9. But at the time when you did not know 
God, you served those who are not gods by nature. 
But now that you have known God, or rather are 
known by God, how do you turn back to the weak and 
meager statutes, which you want to serve anew? 


130 This is the conclusion of Paul's dealings [with the 
Galatians]. After this, until the end of the epistle, he does 
not dispute much, but gives commands concerning life. 
But before that he chides the Galatians, being very 
displeased that this divine and heavenly doctrine should 
have been so suddenly and easily thrust out of their 
hearts, as if to say: You have teachers who want to bring 
you under the bondage of the law; | did not do that, but 
by my teaching | 1) brought you out of darkness and 
ignorance about God into the wonderful light and 
knowledge of God. | have set you free from bondage and 
set you free as children of God, not by preaching to you 
the works of the law and the merits of men, but the grace 
and righteousness of God, and that the heavenly and 
eternal goods are given to you through Christ. Since this) 
is the case, why do you so easily abandon the light and 
return to darkness? Why are you so easily led back from 
grace to law, from freedom to bondage? 

Here we see again, as | also reminded above, that 
one can easily fall in faith, which is proven by the 
example of the Galatians. The same is witnessed today’ 
by the example of the Sacramentarians, Anabaptists 2c. 
We constantly and most diligently inculcate the doctrine 
of the faith, we penetrate and tread... 


1) Wittenberger: vooavit instead of: voonvi. 





We distinguish the gospel from the law in the purest way, 
and yet we accomplish very little. This is the fault of the 
devil, who is a marvelous artist in seducing people. He 
can suffer nothing less than the right knowledge of grace 
and faith in Christ. 

For this reason, in order to take Christ out of our eyes 
and hearts, he presents us with other deceptive images, 
by which he gradually leads people away from faith and 
the knowledge of grace, so that they argue about the 
law. When he has brought them to that point, Christ is 
taken away. It is therefore not in vain that Paul tries to 
impress Christ on us in almost every line, not in vain that 
he presents the doctrine of faith so purely, to which alone 
he ascribes righteousness, but denies it to the law by 
showing that it has just the opposite effect, namely, that 
it works wrath, increases sin 2c. For he would like to 
persuade us not to let Christ be torn from our hearts, so 
that the bride will not let her bridegroom be torn from her 
arms, but will always cling to him. As long as he is 
present, there is no danger, but then there is groaning, 


the gracious Father (paternitas), filiation and 
inheritance. 

But why does Paul say that the Galatians turn to the 
weak and meager statutes, that is, to the law, since they 
never had the law, because they were Gentiles 
(although he also writes this to the Jews, as we will say 
later)? Or why does he not rather speak like this: "In the 
past, when you did not know God, you served those who 
were not gods by nature. But now that you know the true 
God, why do you forsake the true God and turn again to 
the service of idols? Is it one and the same for Paul to 
fall away from the promise to the law, from faith to works, 
and to serve gods who are not gods by nature? | answer: 
Anyone who falls away from the article of justification 
does not know God and is an idolater. Therefore, if 
someone turns back to the law afterwards, it is the same 
as if he turns back to the gods. 


520 Li-l. Il, 190-193. Explanation of Galatians 4, 8. 9. W. VIII, 2442-2445. 


521 





It does not matter whether someone calls himself a monk 
or a Turk, a Jew, an Anabaptist 2c. For when this article 
is gone, nothing remains but pure error, hypocrisy, 
godlessness, idolatry, however much it may appear to be 
the highest truth, as service to God, holiness 2c. 

The reason is that God cannot and will not be known 
in any other way than through Christ, according to this 
word, John 1:18: "The Son who is in the bosom of the 
Father, he has declared it to us. He is the promised seed 
of Abraham, on whom God has based all fine promises. 
Therefore, Christ alone is the means and, | say, the 
mirror through which we see God, that is, recognize His 
will. For we see in Christ that God is not an angry driver 
and judge, but a benevolent and exceedingly kind 
Father, for in order that He might bless us, that is, free 
us from the law, sin, death and all evils, and give us fine 
grace, righteousness and eternal life, He did not spare 
His own fine Son, but gave Him up for us all 2c. This is 
the certain and right knowledge of God, and the divine 


teaching (persuasio), which does not deceive, but 
actually portrays God in a certain form, apart from which 


God is not (extra quam non est Deus). 

Whoever falls from this realization must fall into such 
a conceit: | will establish this service, | will accept that 
order, | will choose this or that work, and thus | will serve 
God. But there is no doubt that God will look at this and 
accept it and give me eternal life in return. For He is 
merciful and kind, since He gives all good things even to 
the unworthy and ungrateful; much more will He give me 
His grace and eternal life for so many and such great 
good works and merits. 
This is the highest wisdom, righteousness and worship, 
as far as reason can judge, and this is what all men have 


in general, as they are by nature (OmNeS gentes), 
Papists, Jews, Muhamedans, heretics 2c. They cannot 
get any higher than that Pharisee in the Gospel [Luc. 18, 
11. f.], they do not recognize the Christian righteousness. 





or that of faith. For the natural man hears nothing of what 
is of God [1 Cor. 2:14], likewise [Rom. 3:11]: "There is 
none that understandeth, there is none that asketh after 
God" 2c. Therefore there is absolutely no difference 
between a Papist, a Jew, a Turk, a heretic 2c. The 
persons, places, customs, services, works, worship 
practices are indeed different, but they all have the same 
reason, the same heart, the same delusion and thoughts. 
A Turk has exactly the same thoughts as a Carthusian, 
namely: If | do this or that, | have a gracious God, if not, 
He is angry with me. There is no middle ground between 
human workmanship and the knowledge of Christ; if this 
is obscured, then it does not matter whether you are a 
monk or a pagan. 

Therefore it is the utmost folly that Papists and Turks 
argue with each other about religion and worship, that 
both claim to have the true religion and the right worship. 
2c. Even the monks themselves do not agree among 
themselves; one wants to be considered holier than the 
other, because of some outward silly ceremonies, while 
in the heart the opinion of all is so equal that one egg 
cannot be so equal to the other. For they all have this 
conceit: If | do this work, God will have mercy on me; if | 
do not, he will be angry with me. Therefore, every man 
who falls away from the knowledge of Christ inevitably 
falls into idolatry, for he must invent such an image 
(formam) of God for himself, which does not exist 
anywhere, as a Carthusian for the sake of keeping the 
fine rule, a Turk because of the observance of the 
alcoran 2c. has the confidence that he pleases God and 
will receive from him the reward of his sour work. 

Such a God, who forgives sins and makes righteous 
in this way, can nowhere be found, therefore it is a vain 
thought and a dream, and the erection (Confictio) of an 
idol in the heart. For nowhere did God promise that He 
would make men righteous and blessed for the sake of 


such services, rules (observationes) and _ practices 


(Cultus) that are devised and instituted by men; indeed, 
God has no greeting in anything. 


522 Lri. Il, 193-ISS. 


Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 244S-2448. 


523 





The Holy Spirit, as all Scripture testifies, is not intereste 
in such self-chosen works and worship, for the sake o 
which he destroyed kingdoms and empires. 

Therefore, all those who trust in their own powers an 
righteousness serve a god who is God only in thei 


delusion (opinabiliter), but not in his essence (natura), 
For the true and essential God speaks thus: N 
righteousness, wisdom and worship pleases me, excep 
this one, through whom the Father is glorified in the Son} 
Whoever takes hold of this Son in faith, and of me or o 
my promise in him, to him | am God, to him | am Father, 
him | accept, making him righteous and blessed. Al 
others remain under wrath, because they worship hi 
who is not GOD by nature. 

(140) Anyone who does not adhere to this doctrin 
inevitably ends up not knowing God correctly, no 
understanding what Christian righteousness and wisdo 
are, what the right services of God are; he is an idolate 
who remains under the law, sin, death and the dominio 
of the devil, and everything he does is lost an 
condemned. 

141. Therefore, if an Anabaptist imagines that h 
pleases God, if he lets himself run again, if he leaves hi 
house, wife and children, if he kills his flesh, if he endure 
much hardship and finally suffers death, in him there i 
already no longer a spark of the knowledge of Christ, bu 
after Christ is excluded, he is caught in his dreams o 
works, abandonment of goods and killing [of the flesh} 
and there is now no difference in mind or heart betwee 
him and a Turk, Jew or Papist, except as to the outwar 
livery, ceremonies or works he chooses for himself. In thi 
way all monks have the same reliance on works, but i 
dress and other outward things they differ. 

There are many others like them today, wh 
nevertheless want to be counted among the evangelica 
teachers and, as far as the words are concerned, teac 
that men are freed from sin through the death of Christ} 
But because they deny the faith in such a way 





If they ascribe more to love than to faith, they do Christ 
the greatest dishonor and pervert His word in a wicked 
and ungodly way, since they dream that God is pleased 
with us and accepts us for the sake of love, through 
which we, already reconciled, 1) love God and our 
neighbor. If this is true, then we have no need of Christ 
at all. Such people do not serve the true God, but the 
idol of their heart, which they have invented for 
themselves. For the true God is not pleased with us and 
does not accept us for the sake of our love, our virtues 
or our newness of being, but for the sake of Christ 2c. 

But they reply: The Scripture commands that we love 
God with all our heart 2c. Quite right, but therefore it 
does not follow: God commands, therefore we also do 
it. If we loved God with all our heart 2c., then we would 
certainly be justified and gain life for the sake of this 
obedience, according to the words [Deut. 18:5]: "The 
man who does these things will live by them.” But the 
gospel says, Thou doest not this, therefore thou shalt 
not live thereby. For this saying: "You shall love God 
your Lord" 2c. requires perfect obedience, perfect fear, 
trust, love towards God. This man in his finely depraved 
nature does not accomplish, nor can he. Therefore this 
law: "You shall love God your Lord" 2c. does not make 
righteous, but accuses all men and condemns them, as 
the Scripture testifies [Rom. 4, 15.]: "The law only 
causes wrath" 2c. On the other hand [Rom. 10, 4.], 
"Christ is the end of the law; he that believeth on Him is 
righteous." Enough has been said about this above 2c. 

(144) In the same way, a Jew who keeps the law, 
thinking that by obeying the law he will please God, does 
not serve the God of his fathers, but is an idolater who 
worships the dream and the idol of his heart, which is 
nowhere. For the God of his fathers, of whom he boasts 
that he serves Him, promised Abraham a seed through 
which all nations should be blessed. Therefore, it is not 
through the Ge-

524 Lri. Oai. I, 195-197. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 4, 8, 9. 


The Gospel of Christ is the only way to know God and 
to receive the blessing. 

Although Paul actually speaks these words: "At the 
time when you did not know God, you served Him" 2c. 
to the Galatians, who were Gentiles, he also attacks the 
Jews with the same words, who, even though they had 
outwardly abandoned idols, nevertheless inwardly 
"worshipped" them more than the Gentiles, as he says 
of them in Rom. 2:22: "You abhor idols, and rob God of 
what is His." The Gentiles were not the people of God, 
they did not have the Word, therefore their idolatry was 
a gross one. But the idolatrous Jews adorned their 


ungodly worship (cultus) with the name of God and His 
Word (as all works saints are wont to do), and deceived 
many by this pretense of godliness. Therefore, the more 
holy and spiritual an idolatry is according to its outward 
appearance, the more harmful it is. 

But how can these two contradictory things that Paul 
exhibits here: "You did not know God" and "You served 
God" be united with each other? 

147 | answer: All people have by nature the general 
knowledge that there is a God, according to the words 
Rom. 1, 19. 20. As far as God can be known, he is 
apparent to them. "For it is known that God is invisible" 
2c. Furthermore, the worship and religions that have 
existed and remained among all pagans sufficiently 
testify that all men have had a certain general 
knowledge of God. But whether they have received this 
by nature or by tradition from their parents, | do not want 
to argue about that now. 

But here again someone would like to interject: If all 
men know God, why then does Paul say that the 
Galatians did not know God before the preaching of the 
Gospel? 

| answer: There is a twofold knowledge of God, the 
general and the actual. All men have the general one, 
namely, that there is one God, that he created heaven 
and earth, that he is righteous, that he punishes the 
wicked 2c. But what God has in mind for us, what He 
wants to give and do, how we can be free from sins and 
death and become blessed (which is the real and true 





525 


| do not know how it can happen that someone is known 
to me face to face, whom | do not really know, because 
| do not know how he is disposed toward me. 
Therefore, people know by nature that there is a God, 
but what He wills or does not will, they do not know, for 
it is written [Rom. 3:11, Ps. 53:3]: "There is no one wise 
who asks about God," and elsewhere [Jn. 1:18]: "No one 
has ever seen God," that is, no one knows what the will 
of God is. But what good is it if you know that God is, 
and yet you do not know what His will is toward you? 
Here one dreams this, the other that. The Jews imagine 
that this is the will of God, that they should serve God as 
prescribed by the Law of Moses, the Turks that they 
should keep their Alkoran, a monk that he had his rule 
and his vows. But they all err and "become vain in their 
thinking," as Paul says Rom. 1:21, because they do not 
know what pleases or displeases God. Therefore, 
instead of the true and essential God, they worship the 
dreams of their heart, which are nothing in their essence 


(natura). 

'This is what Paul indicates when he says: "Since 
you did not know God," that is, since you did not know 
what the will of God was, "you served those who are not 
gods by nature," that is, the dreams and thoughts of your 
heart, through which you fabricated without the Word 
that one must serve God with this or that work or 
ceremony (ritu). For from the fact that people by nature 
hold this sentence: There is one God, all idolatry has 
arisen, which would not have come into the world 
without knowledge of the Godhead. But because men 
had this natural knowledge of God, they formed, apart 
from the word and in contradiction to it, void and ungodly 
thoughts of God, which they assumed to be certain truth, 
and thus imagined God to be different from what He is 
by nature.

527 





Thus, a monk invents such a God who forgives sins, 
gives grace and eternal life for the sake of keeping his 
rule. Such a God is nowhere, therefore he does not 
serve the true God, nor does he worship Him, but such 
a God who is not God by nature, namely a delusion and 
idol of his heart, that is, his false and void opinion of God, 
of which he dreams that it is the most certain truth. But 
now even reason must admit that a human delusion is 
not God. Therefore, he who wants to honor or serve God 
without the word, as Paul says, does not serve the true 
God, but the one who is not God by nature. 

Therefore, it matters little whether he 1) uses the 
name "statutes" to refer to the law of Moses or to any 
statutes of the Gentiles (although he actually and 
primarily speaks of the Mosaic statutes). For he who 
falls back from grace into the law does not fall more 
gently than he who falls from grace into idolatry. For 
apart from Christ there is nothing but idolatry, an idol and 
a false poem of God, whether it be called the Law of 
Moses, or the Law of Pabst, or the Alkoran of the Turk 
2c. Therefore he says with a certain astonishment: 


But now you have recognized God. 


As if he wanted to say: It is very surprising that you, 
who have known God from the preaching of faith, now 
so suddenly fall away from the right knowledge of His 
will (which | thought you had kept so securely and firmly 
that | feared nothing less than that it could be so easily 
overthrown [among you]) and turn again, since the false 
apostles call you to it, to the weak and meager statutes, 
which you want to serve anew. But you have received 
from my preaching that this is the will of God, that he 
wants to bless all nations, not through circumcision or 
the keeping of the law, but through Christ, who was 
promised to Abraham. Those who believe in him will be 
blessed with the faith of God. 


1) Instead of ApptzUkk in the outputs we have assumed ApxsNkt. 





Those who receive the blessing from Abraham are 
children and heirs of God. Thus, | say, you have known 
God. 


Yes, rather, you are recognized by God. 


Here Paul punishes the Galatians in an oratorical 
way, because he improves his previous statement "You 
have now known God", or rather, he turns it around in 
this way: "yes, rather, you are known by God", because 
he fears that they might have lost God completely, as if 
he wanted to say: Alas, the matter has already come to 
such a pass that you now do not know God properly, 
because you have returned from grace to law 2); yet God 
still knows you. And indeed, our knowledge is more a 
suffering than an active one, that is, we are rather 


recognized than we recognize. Our activity (nostrum 


agereé) is that we suffer, that God works in us. God gives 
the Word; if we take hold of it through the faith that God 
gives, we become God's children. 

It is therefore the opinion of the word: "You are known 
by God", that is, you have been visited by the word, you 
have been endowed with faith and the Holy Spirit, by 
which you have been renewed 2c. Therefore, with these 
words, "You have been known by God," he denies the 
righteousness of the law, and he denies that the 
knowledge of God is granted to us because of the 
worthiness of our works. For [Matth. 11, 27.] "No one 
knows the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son 
wills to reveal it. Likewise [Isa. 53, 11]: "By his knowledge 
he will make many righteous, because he bears their sin. 
Therefore, our knowledge of God is a purely suffering 
one. 

157 He is therefore very surprised that they, after 
they have rightly known God through the gospel, 
seduced by the false apostles, so quickly turn back to the 
weak and meager statutes, as it would certainly also 
seem strange to me if our church (which by God's grace 
is very beautifully ordered in pure and wholesome 
doctrine and faith) were so perverted by a fanatical man 
through one or two sermons.

that she would no longer want to recognize me as her 
teacher. This will happen in time, even if not while we are 
alive, but when we are gone. For then many will arise 
who want to be masters, who teach perverse things 
under the appearance of godliness, and in a short time 
will overthrow everything that we have built with the 
greatest effort in a long time. 

We are no better than the apostles themselves, who 
had to see with great suffering during their lifetime that 
the churches they had planted through their ministry 
were perverted. Therefore, it is not surprising if we also 
have to see the same evil in the churches today, in which 
the spirits of the rotten reign, which after our death will 
take over the churches prepared by our ministry, infect 
them with their poison and pervert them. But Christ will 
remain and reign until the end of the world, but 
miraculously, as under the papacy. 

But Paul speaks very shamefully of the law, since he 


calls it "statutes" (elementa) (as also above in the 
beginning of the fourth chapter [§ 14 ff.]), then also not 
only statutes, but "weak and meager statutes". Is it not 
blasphemy that he calls the law of God such shameful 
names? The law in its proper use should serve and stand 
for the promises and grace. But if it is contrary to this, it 
is no longer God's holy law, but a harmful and devilish 
doctrine that only leads to despair. Therefore, it must be 
rejected and banished. 

Therefore, when he calls the law "weak and meager 
statutes," he is speaking of the law according to the 
opinion of the proud and presumptuous hypocrites who 
want to be justified by it, not of the law according to its 
spiritual meaning, which causes wrath. For the law, as 
we have often said, when it is in proper use, accuses and 
condemns the old 1) man. Here it is not only a mighty 


and rich element (elementum), but also omnipotent and 
exceedingly rich, yes, it is an insurmountable 
omnipotence and richness, in the con-

529 


The conscience is exceedingly weak and poor. For it is 
something so delicate that it becomes so frightened and 
pale at the slightest sin that it despairs if it is not raised 
up again. Therefore the law in its right use has more 
strength and power than heaven and earth can hold, so 
that even one tittle or letter of the law could kill the whole 
human race, which the history of the proclamation of the 
law testifies, Ex. 19, 16. 20, 18. 19. This is the right and 
theological use of the law, of which Paul does not speak 
here. 

161 Thus he is speaking here of the hypocrites who 
have fallen from grace or who have not yet attained to 
it. Those who abuse the law, seek to be justified by it, 
toil and labor with its works day and night, as Paul 
testifies of the Jews, Rom. 10:2, 3: "| bear them 
witness," he says, "that they strive for God," that they 
labor day and night, "but with ignorance. For they do not 
know the righteousness that is before GOD. "2c. Such 
people have the confidence that they will become so 
strong and rich through the law that they can oppose 
their power and the wealth of righteousness, which they 
have from the law, to the wrath and judgment of God, 
that they can thereby propitiate God and become 
blessed. In this respect, one can rightly say that the law 
is aweak and meager statute, that is, that it cannot help, 
that there is no counsel nor ability in it. 

And he who would use the art of speech here, could 
act and magnify these words very broadly, in an active 
way, in a suffering way, and in the middle position 


between the two (active, passive et neutraliter). In the 
active way, the law is a weak and meager statute, 
because it makes men weaker and more meager; in the 
suffering way, because it does not have in itself the 
strength and power to bestow or bring righteousness; in 
the middle position, it is weakness and meagerness 
itself. How, then, should it make men strong and rich 
who were weak and scanty before? Therefore, if one 
wants to become righteous through the law, it is just as 
much as if one who is otherwise already weak and poor 
were to become rich and strong. 


530 Lri. n, 202-204. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2456-2400. 


If a man is sick and diseased, he would seek another 
greater evil by which he could dispel his weakness and 
poverty, while it would plunge him into certain 
destruction. As if one who suffers from falling sickness 
were also to catch the plague, or a leper were to come 
to a leper, a beggar to a beggar, in order to bring help to 
the other and enrich him. Here, as the saying goes, one 
would milk a goat and the other would hold a sieve under 
it. 


163. this is a beautiful diminutive speech (tapinosis 


= TATTEIVWOIG), with which Pau 

This is to show that those who seek to become righteous 
by the law have the advantage of becoming weaker and 
weaker day by day, because they are already weak and 
meager, that is, they are by nature children of wrath, 
guilty of death and eternal damnation, and they take hold 
of what is only weakness and beggary, by which they 
seek to become strong and rich. Therefore, every man 
who falls away from the promise to the law, from faith to 
works, does nothing but, being weak and meager, lays 
upon himself an unbearable yoke, Acts 15:10. 15:10, 
from whose burden he becomes ten times weaker and 
more meager, until he finally despairs, unless Christ 
comes and delivers him. The same is testified by the 
gospel of the woman who had been in the throes of 
hemorrhage for twelve years, and had suffered much at 
the hands of many physicians, and had consumed all 
she had, and yet nothing helped her, but the longer she 
was cured, the worse she became 2c. [Therefore, all 
who do the works of the law with the intention of 
becoming righteous are not only not righteous, but 
twofold unrighteous, that is, as | said, they become 
weaker and more unskilled in every good work through 
the law 2c. 

| have experienced this myself and in many others. In the 
papacy | have seen many monks who with the most 
ardent zeal did many and great works to attain 
righteousness and blessedness, and yet no one was 
more impatient than they, no one weaker, more 
miserable, no one more faithless, more fearful and more 
in despair. The people in secular authority, with the 
greatest and most 


531 


They were not so impatient and so womanishly impotent, 
they were not so superstitious, unbelieving, fearful 2c. 
as such work saints. 

Therefore, anyone who seeks righteousness through 
the law does nothing but accustom himself, through 
repeated actions, to insist on his first intention, namely, 
that the angry and terrifying God must be reconciled 
through works. In this preconceived opinion, he begins 
to do works. But he can never find so many works as to 
satisfy his conscience, but desires more and more of 
them; indeed, even in those he has done he finds sins. 
Therefore, his conscience can never be made certain, 
but must necessarily always be in doubt, thinking: You 
did not say mass properly, you did not pray properly, you 
omitted something, you committed this or that sin. Then 
the heart trembles and finds itself always laden with 
many cargos full of sins, which increase without end, so 
that he falls further and further away from righteousness, 
until finally despair becomes a permanent condition 
(habitum) with him. 

For this reason, many have uttered such lamentable 
words in despair in their death throes: | wretched man, | 
have not kept my order; where shall | go before the face 
of the angry judge of Christ? Would God that | had been 
a swineherd or the least of all men on earth. Thus, a 
monk at the end of his life is weaker, more meager, more 
faithless and more fearful than in the beginning when he 
accepted his order. The cause is that he has sought to 
strengthen himself through weakness and to become 
rich through poverty. The law, or human statutes, or the 
rule of his order should have made him, who was sick 
and poor, healthy and rich, but he has become weaker 
and poorer than publicans and harlots. For these have 
not that unfortunate habitual inclination (xxxx) to works, 
on which they rely, as a monk does, but, however much 
they may feel their sins, they can say with the publican 
[Luc. 18, 13.], "God, be merciful to me a sinner!" 

On the other hand, a monk who works with the weak 


532 Lri. "Li. Il, 204-206. Exec. Explanation of Galatians 4, 9. W. VIII, 2460-2463. 


533 





The one who has constantly dealt with the poor and 
meager statutes has acquired this way of thinking 


(habitum): If you keep your rule, you will be blessed 2c. 
Through this false conviction he has become so 
nonsensical and so caught up in it that he cannot grasp 
grace before it, indeed, he cannot even think of grace. 
Therefore, neither his past nor his present works, 
however many and great they may be, are enough for 
him, but he always looks out and searches for others and 
others with which he strives to appease the wrath of God 
and to justify himself, until he finally has to despair. 
Therefore, he who falls from faith and pursues the law, 
like the dog in the fable of Aesop, 1) loses the flesh and 
seeks after the shadow. 

Therefore, it is impossible for people who want to 
establish counsel for their happiness through the law (as 
we all are by nature) to ever become calm (in their 
consciences, indeed, they do nothing but heap laws 
upon laws, with which they torture themselves and 
others and weigh down the consciences so miserably 
that very many die before time from excessive grief of 
the soul. For one law always draws ten others after it, 
until they finally grow to infinity. This is sufficiently 


testified by the innumerable collections (SUMMae) 
(especially the diabolical one, to which they have given 
the title "the angelic" 2)), which have brought together 
and interpreted such laws. 

In short, he who undertakes to become righteous by 
the law subjects himself to what he can never 
accomplish. Here may be drawn what, | see, the fathers 
also did, namely, the sayings of learned and wise men 
about futile toil, as, rolling a stone, drawing water with a 
sieve 2c., and | believe that by such poems and parables 
the fathers wished to remind their disciples of the 
difference between the law and the gospel, so that they 
might show them that those who have fallen from grace, 
though they labor and are weary with constant and very 
arduous toil, are toiling in vain. 


1) Phaedrus, lib. I, fab. IV. 
2) For the summa angelica, see our edition, Vol. XIX, 97. 





make. That is why it is said of such people that they roll 
a stone, that is, they toil in vain, as the poets write of 
Sisyphus in the fable that as often as he rolled a boulder 
to the top of a mountain in the underworld, the same 
boulder rolled back again and again; Likewise, to draw 
water with a sieve, that is, to toil with inexhaustible and 
useless labor, as the poets write that the daughters of 
Danaus in the underworld must pour water into a holed 
barrel with perforated ladles 2c. 

170. And | wish that you students of theology would 
collect more such parables, so that you might better 
remember the difference between the Law and the 
Gospel, [for example] that if one wants to be justified by 
the Law, this is just as much as if one wants to count 
money out of an empty box, eat out of an empty bowl 
and drink out of an empty pitcher, to seek strength and 
wealth where there is only weakness and poverty, to 
make a heavy burden even heavier for one who sighs 
and succumbs under it, to want to pay a hundred gold 
florins and not even have one lighter, to strip a naked 
man of his garment, 3) to oppress a sick and needy man 
with greater weakness and lack 2c. 

Who could have ever believed that the Galatians, 
who had learned the pure and certain truth from such a 
great apostle as their teacher, could so soon have been 
turned away from it and completely perverted by the 
false apostles? For it is not for nothing that | so often 
point out that it is very easy to fall away from the truth of 
the Gospel. The reason for this is that even godly people 
do not sufficiently consider how precious and necessary 
the right knowledge of Christ is. Therefore, they do not 
strive with such great care and diligence to attain and 
retain it surely and firmly. 

The greater part of those who hear the Word are not 
exercised by the cross; they do not struggle with sin, 
death and the devil, but live securely without all strife. 
Because such people are not exercised by God's Word

535 





If they are fortified against the cunning attempts of the 
devil, they are not exercised and proved by temptations, 
therefore they never experience the custom and the 
power of the word. Indeed, as long as godly teachers are 
with them, they repeat them, and are certainly convinced 
that they have the best grasp of the matter of 
justification. But as soon as they are gone, and wolves 
in sheep's clothing come, they are like the Galatians, that 
is, they are soon and easily seduced and turn back to 
the weak and meager statutes. 

Now Paul has his own peculiar way of speaking, 
which the other apostles did not use. For none of them 
calls the law by such names, namely, that it is a weak 
and meager element, that is, more than useless for the 
attainment of righteousness, than Paul alone. Nor would 
| dare to call the law so, but would think that this would 
be the highest blasphemy, if Paul had not done it before. 
But | have spoken about this in more detail above, when 
the law is weak and meager, likewise when it is 
exceedingly strong and rich 2c. 

If the law of God is weak and not useful for 
justification, much more are the laws of the pope weak 
and not useful for justification; not that | condemn and 
condemn all his laws in general, but | say that very many 
are useful for outward discipline, so that everything in the 
church is done properly, and division and enmity do not 
arise, just as the imperial laws are useful to govern the 
countries well, 2c. 

The pope is not satisfied with this praise and use of 
his laws, but demands that we believe that by keeping 
them we will be justified and attain salvation. We say no 
to this, and with the same confidence and certainty as 
Paul against the law of God, we pass this judgment 
against the decrees, statutes and laws of the pope, that 
they are not only weak, meager statutes and of no use 
for righteousness, but statutes worthy of condemnation, 
cursed and devilish, because they blaspheme grace, 
pervert the gospel, deny faith, and take away Christ 2c. 
Therefore, insofar as the pope requires that they be 
condemned 





He is the Antichrist and the governor of Satan, and all 
those who follow him and confirm his abominations and 
blasphemies, or think that they want to earn forgiveness 
of sins through them, are servants of the Antichrist and 
the devil. 

But the whole papal church has taught and held it for 
many centuries as necessary for salvation. Therefore, 
the pope sits in the temple of God, pretends to be God, 
but is an offender against God, and exalts himself above 
all that is called God or worship, 2c., 2 Thess. 2, 4. and 
the consciences have feared the laws and ordinances of 
the pope more and held them in higher honor than the 
word and ordinances of God. And therefore he has 
become the Lord of heaven, earth and hell, and has 
worn the triple crown; therefore the cardinals and 
bishops, his creatures, have become kings and princes 
of the world; and therefore, if he did not weigh down the 
consciences with his laws, he would not keep this terrible 
power, dignity, wealth 2c. for long, but his whole empire 
would fall immediately. 

This doctrine, which Paul treats, is a very important 
one, therefore it must be noted that those who fall away 
from grace back to the law completely lose all knowledge 
of the truth, do not see their sin, know neither God, nor 
themselves, nor the devil, and even do not understand 
the law in its power and use, even though they boast of 
observing it to the highest degree. For without 
knowledge of grace, that is, of the gospel of Christ, it is 
impossible for a man to understand that the law is a 
weak and meager element, which is of no use for 
righteousness, but he judges of the law just the opposite, 
namely, that it is not only necessary for salvation, but 
that it also makes the weak and meager strong and rich, 
that is, that those who do it deserve righteousness and 
eternal salvation. 

178. if this delusion endures, the promise of God is 
denied, Christ is taken away 2c., it becomes the lie, the 
God-.

The pope with all the bishops, high schools and his whole 
synagogue taught that his laws were necessary for 
righteousness. The pope with all the bishops, high 
schools and his whole synagogue taught that his laws 
were necessary for righteousness. Therefore he has 
been a teacher of weak and meager statutes, by which 
he has made the church of Christ exceedingly weak and 
poor throughout the earth, that is, he has burdened it with 
his ungodly laws and made it utterly miserable, while 
Christ has been obscured and his gospel buried and 
buried. Therefore, if you want to keep the laws of the 
pope without violating the conscience, keep it without the 
delusion of obtaining righteousness through it, for it is 
given through Christ alone. 


Whom you want to serve anew. 


He adds this to show that he is speaking of the 
arrogant and presumptuous hypocrites who seek to be 
justified by the law, as | have often indicated above. 
Otherwise he calls the law holy, good 2c., as 1 Tim. 1, 8: 
"We know that the law is good, if anyone uses it rightly," 
namely, worldly, to keep the wicked in check, 
theologically, to increase sins. But he who uses the law 
to attain righteousness before God does not know what 
he is saying or what he is doing, and makes the good law 
harmful and damning to himself. 

180 He therefore punishes the Galatians for wanting 
to serve the law anew, which does not free them from 
sin, but only increases it. For if a sinner, weak and 
meager in himself, seeks to be justified by the law, he 
finds nothing in it but weakness and meagerness. For’ 
two sick and beggars come together, one of whom only 
burdens the other more, but does not help. 

We, who are strong in Christ, desire to serve the law, 
not the weak and scanty law, but the strong and 
abundant law, that is, in so far as it is effective, having 
dominion over the body 2c. For then we serve the law 
only with the body and members, not with the 
conscience. 

But the pope demands that we serve his laws with 
this opinion: If you do, you are righteous, if not. 








then you are damned. There the law is more than a weak 
and meager element 2c., because as long as this 
bondage of the conscience under the law lasts, it can be 
nothing but pure weakness and meagerness. That is why 
all the emphasis is on the word "serve". Paul is therefore 
saying that the conscience should not serve as a 
prisoner under the law, but should be free and the 
mistress of the law. For through Christ it has died to the 
law, and the law has died to it, which is spoken of in more 
detail in the second chapter above. 


V. 10. You keep days and moons, and feasts and 
seasons. 


With these words he clearly shows what the false 
apostles taught, namely, that one must keep days and 
months, feasts and seasons. Almost all teachers have 
interpreted this passage from the astrological days of the 
Chaldeans, that the pagans observed certain days, 
months 2c. in their undertakings, in the expectation of 
events in their lives and in their business, and that the 
Galatians, at the instigation of the false apostles, had 
done the same. And Augustine, followed by the later 
ones, interpreted these words of Paul also from this 
pagan custom (ritu), although he interprets it later also 
from the days, months 2c. of the Jews. About this in the 


decrees 2c. is a confused talk (disputatio). 

184 But Paul instructs the conscience, therefore he 
does not speak of the pagan custom of choosing days 
2c. which concerns only the body, but he speaks of the 
law of God and of the observance of days, months 2c. 
according to the law of Moses, that is, of worship 


(religiosis) days, months and times, which the Galatians 
kept according to the instruction of the false apostles, in 
order to become righteous. For in Moshi's writings the 
Jews had been commanded that they should 
conscientiously keep the day of Sahbath and the new 
moons, the months, the first and the seventh, three 
appointed times or feasts, namely the Passover, the 
Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles, the year 
of Jubilee and Jubilee. These habits (rite) they also kept, 
forced by the false apostles, as 


538 Arl- 6ai. Il, 211-214. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2470-2473. 


necessary to righteousness. Hence he says that they 
have lost grace and Christian liberty, and have returned 
to the bondage of weak and meager statutes. For they 
had been persuaded by the false apostles that these 
laws must necessarily be kept, and if one kept them, they 
would make one righteous; if one did not keep them, one 
would be damned. 

In contrast, Paul in no way allows consciences to be 
bound by the Mosaic law, but makes them free from the 
law everywhere. "Behold, | Paul say unto you," he says 
below Cap. 5, 2, "where ye are circumcised, Christ is of 
no profit unto you," and Col. 2, 16: "Let no man therefore 
make you conscience about meat, or about drink, or 
about certain feasts, or new moons, or sabbaths. "2c. So 
also Christ says [Luc. 17, 20.]: "The kingdom of God 
does not come through the outward keeping of the law" 


(cum observatione legis) 1) Much less should the 
consciences be burdened and entangled with human 
statutes. 

Here someone might say, "If the Galatians sinned by 
keeping days and feasts, why is it not sin for you to do 
the same? 

187 | answer: We keep Sunday, Christmas Day, 
Easter and similar feasts quite free, we do not trouble 


the consciences with these outward customs (ritibus), 
nor do we teach, as the false apostles and the papists 
did, that they are necessary for righteousness, or that by 
them we can do enough for sins, but [keep them,so that 
everything in the church may proceed in an orderly 
manner and without unrest, and that the outward unity 
(for in the spirit we have a different unity) may not be torn 
apart, as once happened when the Roman pope Victor 
put all the congregations in Asia under ban for no other 
reason than because they celebrated Easter at a 
different time than the Roman church was accustomed 
to do. Irenaeus punished Victor for this, as it was 
certainly reprehensible. For it was utter foolishness to 
hand over the churches of the East to the devil because 
of such a trivial matter. Therefore 


1) In the Vulgate: cum observatione, with omission of. 





539 


the right knowledge of keeping days and times was 
rarely found, even among the greatest men. Jerome did 
not have it, and even Augustine would not have 
understood it properly if he had not been plagued by the 
Pelagians and practiced by them. 

But especially do we keep such feasts, that the 
ministry of preaching may flourish, that the people may 
come together on certain days and at certain times to 
hear the word, that they may learn to know God, use the 
sacrament, pray publicly for all kinds of need, likewise, 
give thanks to God for His spiritual and bodily benefits; 
and | believe that it was primarily for this reason that the 
keeping of Sunday, Easter, Pentecost 2c. was instituted 
by the Fathers. 


V. 11. I fear you, lest perhaps I have 
labored with you in vain. 


With these words, he indicates that the apostasy of 
the Galatians has gone very much to his heart and that 
he would have liked to scold them more severely, but he 
fears that by punishing them too harshly he would not 
improve them, but only irritate them more and alienate 
them completely. Therefore he changes and softens the 
words while writing, and now speaks as if he almost 
alone had the damage, saying: "| fear for you that | have 
not perhaps labored in vain with you,” that is, "It grieves 
me that | have preached the gospel with such great 
diligence and faithfulness among you, and yet it has 
gone without fruit. 

(190) Yet, although he treats them with the utmost 
gentleness and true fatherly care, at the same time he 
scolds them rather harshly, but in a hidden way. For 
since he says that he labored in vain, that is, that he 
preached the gospel to them without fruit, he secretly 
indicates that they were either obstinately unbelieving or 
that they had fallen away from the doctrine of faith. Both 
the unbelievers and the apostates are still sinners, 
ungodly, unrighteous and condemned. Therefore, such 
people are also obedient to the law in vain, keeping the 
days, moons 2c. in vain. 

191. and in these words: "I fear yours, that | have not 
perhaps worked on you in vain", is a kind of secret spell. 


540 Dri. Oai. Il, 214-216 
contain. For the apostle implies that the Galatians are 
thereby separated from Christ and excluded if they do not 
return to the right doctrine. But he does not pronounce 
this judgment publicly. For he believed that he would not 
achieve anything by punishing them more severely. That 
is why he changes his spelling and speaks to them in a 
very kind way: 


V. 12. Be like me, for I am like you. 
This passage is not one in which Paul teaches 


(dialecticus), but full of emotions, which must be treated 
rhetorically. Up to this point, Paul has been teaching, and 
while teaching, moved by the great impropriety of the 
matter, he has become very heated against the 
Galatians, and has scolded them with very harsh words, 
calling them unintelligent, charmed, people who do not 
believe the truth, crucifiers of Christ 2c. Now that the 
greater part of the epistle is almost finished, he begins to 
realize that he has treated them too harshly. Since he is 
therefore concerned that he might have done more harm 
than good by his severity, he indicates that this harsh 
scolding came from a fatherly and truly apostolic spirit, 
and uses miraculous oratory and overflows with loving 
and gentle speeches, keeping in mind that if perhaps 
some (of whom there were undoubtedly many) had been 
offended by his harsh scolding, he would like to pacify 
them again by his gentle words. 

At the same time he reminds the shepherds and 
bishops by his example that they should also have a 
fatherly and motherly heart, not against ravening wolves, 
but against the wretched, deceived and erring sheep, 
that they should bear their weakness and fall patiently 
and treat them with the utmost gentleness. For they 
cannot be brought back to the right way in any other way; 
for by scolding them too harshly they are moved to anger, 
or even to despair, not to repentance. 

194 And that | also remind you of this in passing is the 
essence and fruit of the wholesome doctrine, that when 
it is well taught and recognized, it unites hearts in the 
highest harmony. But when people abandon the doctrine 
of godliness and fall into the trap of error 


. Explanation of Galatians 4, 11. 12. W. VIII, 2473-2476. 





541 


If they adhere to the law, this unity of hearts will be torn 
apart. Therefore, as soon as you see that brothers or 
disciples, seduced by spirits, fall away from the article of 
justification, you will soon find out that they persecute 
the godly with the most bitter hatred, whom they loved 
very much before. 

We experience this today in our false brothers, the 
Sacramentarians and Anabaptists, who, when the cause 
of the Gospel was at stake, listened to us gladly and read 
our writings eagerly, recognized the gift of the Holy Spirit 
in us and therefore honored us as God's servants. Some 
of them also lived with us for a while in intimate contact 
and behaved extremely modestly among us. But after 
they went out from us and passed away through the 
swarming spirits, no one is more devoted to our 
teachings and our name than they are. They also hate 
the papists, but not as bitterly as us. 

196. | often wonder very much where such a raging 
and frightening hatred could have come into their hearts 
so suddenly, since they loved us so warmly before, since 
we did not offend them in the least or give them a reason 
to persecute us with hatred; Indeed, they must confess 
that we seek only that Christ's good deeds and glory 
may be praised, that the truth of the Gospel may be 
taught purely, which God has revealed anew through us 
to the ungrateful world in this last time, which should 
have stirred them rather to love than to hate us. 
Therefore, | am rightly wondering where this change 
might come from. But it is no other cause than that they 
have heard new masters. Infected by their poison, they 
are so inflamed that they work against us in such an 
irreconcilable way and are so fiercely bitter against us 


(ardeant). 

And | see that this is the fate of the apostles and all 
godly ministers of the word, that their disciples and 
hearers, infected by the godless opinions of the 
enthusiasts and perverted by them, burn with anger and 
hatred against their teachers. Very few among the 
Galatians remained steadfast to Paul's teaching. All the 
others, who were seduced by the false apostles, no 
longer recognized Paul as their teacher. 


542 Lri. <4ai. Il, 216-218. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2476-2179. 543 


Indeed, nothing was more detestable to them than the 
name and teaching of Paul, and | fear that through this 
epistle he has freed very few from their error and brought 
them to their senses. 

If the same were to happen to us, that is, if in our 
absence our church were to be perverted by the 
enthusiasts, and we were to write here not just one or 
two, but many letters, we would achieve little or nothing. 
Our people, with the exception of a few who are more 
firmly grounded in doctrine, would behave no differently 
toward us than those are behaving toward us today who 
are seduced by the sectarians, who would rather 
worship the pope than obey our exhortations or approve 
of our teaching. No one will be able to persuade them 
that they have lost Christ and now serve again the weak 
and meager statutes and those who are not gods by 
nature. They can hear nothing less than that their 
teachers, by whom they are deceived, are perverters of 
the gospel of Christ and confounders of consciences and 
churches. 1) The Lutherans, they say, are not alone 
wise, do not alone preach Christ, do not alone have the 
Holy Spirit, the gift of prophecy and the right 
interpretation of the Scriptures. Our teachers are in no 
way inferior to them; indeed, in many respects they are 
superior, for they follow the Spirit and teach spiritual 
things. On the other hand, those [the Lutherans] have 
never touched true theology, but cling to the letter, and 
therefore they teach nothing but the catechism, faith, 
love 2c. 

Therefore, as | often say, fo easy a fall is in faith, so 
dangerous it is also, namely from high heaven down into 
the deepest abyss of hell. It is not a human fall, like 
murder, adultery 2c., but a diabolical fall. For those who 
fall in this way cannot be easily restored, but usually 
persist stubbornly in their error. Therefore they become 
worse than they were before, as Christ testifies when he 
says (Luc. 11, 24. ff.): "When the unclean spirit comes 
out of his crowd, he will become a devil. 


1) et ecclesiarum is missing in the Wittenberg. 


is thrown out, when he returns, he does not go into it 
alone, but he takes seven other spirits with him that are 
worse than himself, and dwells there 2c. 

200 Since Paul now realized, as the Holy Spirit told 
him, that by this severe punishment the hearts of the 
Galatians, whom he in godly zeal had called unintelligent 
2c., would be more embittered than improved (especially 
since he already knew that the false apostles were doing 
their business among them, who would interpret this 
punishment coming from a fatherly heart in the worst 
way, and would cry out: Now Paul, whom some among 
you praise so much, gives himself to the day fund shows) 
by what spirit he is driven. When he was present, he 
wanted to be regarded as your father, but the letters he 
writes in his absence sufficiently testify that he is a tyrant 
2c.) Therefore, out of godly emotion and _ fatherly 
concern, he is so distressed that he does not know what 
or how to write to them. For it is very dangerous to put a 
matter in writing to people when one is not present with 
them, and they have already begun to hate the writer, 
and have been persuaded by others that he has no good 
cause. Therefore, he is very upset and soon after says 
fV. 20): "| am wrong about you", that is, | do not know 
what | am doing or how | should deal with you 2c. 


Be like me, for I am like you. 


These words must be understood not from the 
doctrine, but from the attitude (aliaetibus). Therefore the 
meaning of these words: "Be like me" is not this: Hold of 
the doctrine as | do, but: be minded toward me as | am 
toward you, as if he meant to say: | may have punished 
you too harshly, but hold this severity against me, do not 
judge my heart by these words, but receive the words 
according to the disposition of my heart. Though the 
words seem harsh and as a sharp rod, yet my heart is 
mild and fatherly. Therefore, my dear Galatians, receive 
this punishment of mine with such a heart as | had when 
| punished you. For the cause required that | should 
show myself so severe toward you. 


544 Ari. Oai. n, 218-221. Explanation of Galatians 4, 12. W. VIII, 2479-2482. 


545 





Our punishment is also harsh and the writing is 
violent, but truly the heart is not bitter, not spiteful, not 
vengeful against the adversaries, but there is a godly 
sorrow and grief of spirit in us. | do not hate the papists 
and other erroneous spirits in such a way that | should 
wish them evil and desire that they come to ruin, but 
rather | would like them to get back on the right path and 
become blessed with us. 

A disciplinarian punishes his pupil not for his own 
destruction but for his own good. The rod is sharp, but 
the chastisement is very necessary for the child, and the 
heart of the chastiser is kind and sincere. Thus a father 
chastises his son, not to spoil him, but to make him 
better. The blows are hard and burdensome for the son, 
but the father's heart is without deceit and kind, and if he 
did not love the son, he would not chastise him, but 
would push him away and despair of his salvation, and 
would let him perish. But that he chastises him is a sign 
of the father's affection for the son, and is very useful to 
the son. So you also, my dear Galatians, should look at 
my punishment, and then you will not judge that it is 
severe, but that it is beneficial. Hebr. 12, 11: "All 
chastening, when it is, seems to us not to be joy, but 
sorrow; but afterward" 2c. Therefore let there be with you 
the same disposition toward me as | have toward you. | 
have a kind heart toward you; | require the same of you. 

In this way, Paul gives good words to the Galatians 
and lays great stress on his kindness, so that he may 
soothe and restore their tempers, which were irritated by 
his harsh punishment. But he does not retract his words 
with which he punished them; he does confess that he 
was harsh and sharp, but necessity, he says, forced me 
to scold you somewhat harshly. But with this | mitigate 
my rebuke, that [I tell you that] it was done out of a well- 
meaning and altogether kind heart. A physician gives a 
sick person the most bitter potion, not because he 
wishes the sick person ill, but because he wants to help 
him in this way. Therefore, if something is given to a sick 
person 





If bitter is given, one must not blame the physician, but 
the medicine and the disease. You should judge the 
same of my severe punishment. 


Dear brothers, I beg you, you have done me no 
harm. 


205 Does Paul's "asking" mean that he calls the 
Galatians enchanted, disobedient to the truth, crucifiers 
of Christ? | would rather call it an abuse. On the other 
hand, he says it is not an insult, but a plea, and in fact it 
is like that, as if he wanted to say: It is true that | have 
scolded you a little too harshly, but only take it in the right 
way, and then you will find that my scolding is not a 
scolding but a pleading. Thus, when a father chastises 
his son, it is just as much as if he said to him, My dear 
son, | beseech thee, be righteous 2c. It may seem to be 
a chastisement, but if you look at the father's heart, it is 
the kindest plea. 


I did not feel sorry for you. 


206 As if he wanted to say: Why should | be angry 
with you or revile you out of displeasure, since you have 
done me no harm? - Why then do you say that we are 
reprobates, apostates from your teaching, unintelligent, 
enchanted? This testifies sufficiently that we must have 
harmed you. - Rather, you have not harmed me, but 
yourselves, and that is why | am so distressed, not for 
my sake, but for yours. So do not think that my rebuke 
has come from an angry heart, from hatred or any other 
sinful impulse (vitio). For | call God to witness that you 
have done me no harm at all, but on the contrary have 
shown me many benefits, as follows. 

By speaking kindly to the Galatians in this way, he 
prepares their hearts to bear his fatherly chastisements 
in a childlike spirit, that is, to season the wormwood and 
bitter drink with honey and sugar so that it becomes 
sweet again. In this way parents act kindly with their 
children: when they have chastised their children well, 
they give them baked goods, 


546 Lri. Kai. II, 221-223. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2482-2486. 


547 





Cakes, pears, apples 2c. and such small gifts by which 
the children realize that the parents have the greatest 
goodwill towards them, however severe the 
chastisement may have been. 


V. 13, 14: For ye know that in weakness according 
to the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first 
time. And my trials, which I suffer according to the 
flesh, ye have not despised nor scorned; but as an 
angel of God ye receive me, even as Christ Jesus. 


Now he explains what kind of benefits he received 
from the Galatians. The first benefit, he says, which | 
esteem most highly of all, is this: When | first began to 
preach the gospel among you, and that in weakness of 
the flesh and great temptations, my cross did not vex 
you, but you were so good, kind, favorable, and loving 
toward me, that not only were you not vexed by this 
weakness of the flesh, nor by the temptations and 
dangers with which | was almost overwhelmed, but you 
treated me with the highest love, and received me as an 
angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 

209 This is certainly high praise for the Galatians that 
they accepted the gospel from such a despised and 
afflicted man as Paul was. For he preached the gospel 
among them, while Jews and Gentiles raged and raged 
against it. For all that was mighty, wise, learned, and 


spiritual (religiosum) hated, persecuted, ate up Paul, 
trampled him under foot, and blasohemed him. In all this 
the Galatians took no offense, but putting what they saw, 
this weakness, temptations and dangers out of their 
sight, not only heard the meager, despised, miserable, 
afflicted Paul, and professed to be his disciples; but also 
above as an angel of God, yea, as Christ JEsum they 
received him and heard him. This is a glorious praise and 
virtue of the Galatians, and of course he never gave such 
great praise to any of those to whom he wrote as here to 
the Galatians. 
210. Jerome and certain other fathers 








from the number of the ancients say that the weakness 
of the flesh in Paulo was a bodily disease or a challenge 
to pleasure. These good fathers lived at a time when the 
church was doing well, without cross and persecution. 
For the bishops had already begun to grow and increase 
in wealth, esteem and honor among the race, and most 
also exercised tyranny over the people over whom they 
presided, as church history testifies. Few of them 
directed their office, and those who wanted to be 
respected for it, as if they did, left the teaching of the 
Gospel pending, and presented their decrees to the 
people. But if the pastors and bishops lack the 
knowledge, the practice and the right handling of the 
pure word, they must become secure, for they are not 
exercised by temptations, crosses and persecutions, 
which are quite certain to follow the pure preaching of the 
word. Therefore, it was not possible for them to 
understand Paul. 

211. But we have, by the grace of God, the pure 
doctrine, which we also freely confess. Therefore, we 
must also suffer the most furious hatred and 
persecutions of the devil and the world, and if we were 
not plagued with violence and cunning by tyrants and 
heretics, and in our hearts by the fiery darts of Satan, 
Paul would be as obscure and unknown to us as he was 
to the whole world in earlier centuries and still is to our 
adversaries, the papists and fanatics. Therefore, the gift 
of prophecy and our study, together with the inward and 
outward temptations, open to us the mind of Paul and all 
Scripture. 

Now Paul does not call "weakness according to the 
flesh" a disease or the air of well-being, but sufferings or 
afflictions that he had to endure in his body, so that the 
contrast is against the power or strength of the Spirit. But 
lest we seem to do violence to Paul's words, let us hear 
him for ourselves. In the second letter to the Corinthians, 
Cap. 12, 9. 10., he says: "I will most gladly boast of my 
weakness, that the power of Christ may dwell with me. 
Therefore | am of good courage in weakness, in trouble, 
in distress, in persecution, in anguish for Christ's sake. 
For when | am weak. 


548 Osi. II, 223-226. Explanation of Galatians 4, 13. 14. W. 


| am strong." And Cap. 11, 23-25: "| have worked more, 
| have suffered more blows, | have been imprisoned 
more often, | have often been in mortal peril. From the 
Jews | have received five times forty strokes less one. | 
have been beaten three times, stoned once, 
shipwrecked three times" 2c. These sufferings that he 
had to endure in his body, he calls weakness according 
to the flesh, not a bodily malaise, as if to say: When | 
preached the gospel among you, | was overwhelmed 
with various plagues and afflictions, threatened on every 
side with persecutions and dangers from Jews, Gentiles, 
and false brethren 2c. | suffered hunger and lack of all 
things, | was a curse of the world and a fegopfer of all 
people. He mentions this weakness of his everywhere, 
as 1 Cor. 4. 2 Cor. 4. 6. 11. 12. and elsewhere. 

It is therefore quite clear that Paul refers to 
"weakness according to the flesh" as the afflictions 
which he suffered according to the flesh, and which he 
had in common with the other apostles, prophets and all 
the godly; but in the spirit he was strong. For the power 
of Christ dwelt in him, which always reigned and 
triumphed through him, as he testifies in 2 Cor. 12:10, 
"When | am weak, then am | strong"; likewise, v. 9, "I will 
most gladly boast of my weakness, that the power of 
Christ may dwell with me"; and Cap. 2, 14: "Thanks be 
to God, who always gives us victory in Christ," as if to 
say: "The devil rages against us in a cruel way, the 
unbelieving Jews and Gentiles rage against us, yet we 
stand firm and unconquered against their attempts, and 
our doctrine breaks through and triumphs, whether they 
want it or not. This was the power and strength of the 
Spirit in Paul, which he contrasts here with his weakness 
and bondage according to the flesh. 

But this weakness according to the flesh in the godly 
is very annoying to reason. Therefore Paul rightly 
praises the Galatians so highly that they did not take 
offense at this extremely annoying weakness and the 
contemptible figure of the cross, which they saw in him, 
but received him as an angel, yes, as Christ. And Christ 
himself fortifies his own against 





VII, 2486-2489. 549 


this lowly figure of the cross, in which he himself 
appeared, saying [Matt. 11:6.], "And blessed is he that 
taketh not offense at me." And it is certainly something 
great that those who believe in Him acknowledge Him 
as the Lord over all things and the Savior of the world, of 
whom they hear that He is the most wretched, the most 


unworthy (novissimum) among all men [Isa. 53, 3.], a 
mockery of the people and contempt of the people [Ps. 
22, 7.], in short, hated by all, yes, condemned to death 
on the cross, and that by his own people and especially 
by those who were the best, wisest, holiest people 2c. It 
is a great thing, | say, that one should not be moved by 
these tremendous aversions, and should not despise all 
this alone, but should esteem this scourged, scourged 
and most shamefully crucified Christ more highly than 
the treasures of all the rich, than the power of all the 
mighty, than the wisdom of all teachers, than the crowns 
of all kings, than the worship of all the saints. Therefore, 
Christ rightly calls blessed those who do not take offense 
at him. 

Now Paul had not only the outward temptations, of 
which we have already said, but also inward and spiritual 
ones, like Christ in the garden, when there was the stake 
in the flesh and Satan's angel beating him with fists, 
about which he complains 2 Cor. 12:7. He who is 
afflicted with these spiritual temptations cannot possibly 
be afflicted with [temptation to] unchastity. | mention this 
in passing because the papists, seeing that the Latin 


translation had stimulus carnis, interpreted this "sting" to 


have been a temptation (motus) to unchastity. But in the 
Greek there is ox6/A0%, which means a stake or a very 


sharply pointed rod (sudem). So this has been a spiritual 
challenge. This is not contradicted by the fact that he 
adds the word "flesh," since he says, "A stake is given to 
me in the flesh." Yes, intentionally he calls it a stake in 
the flesh, because the Galatians and others with whom 
Paul had dealt had often seen him suffering from great 
sadness, trembling, terrified, and tormented by 


inexpressible pain and sorrow (moestitia). 


550 6ai. Il, 226-228. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2489-2492. 


551 





216 Therefore the apostles had not only bodily but 
also spiritual temptations, which he also expresses in 2 
Cor. 7, 5. with these words: "Inward fear, outward strife." 
And Lucas in the Acts of the Apostles in the last chapter 
[27, 15.] says that Paul, after he had long been tossed 
about in the storms of the sea, so that he fell into great 
sadness of spirit, was refreshed again and gained a 
confidence, seeing that the brethren of Rome met him as 
far as Appifer and Tretabern; 2) likewise Phil. 2, 27. Paul 
confesses that God had mercy on him, because he made 
Epaphroditus, who was sick and already close to death, 
well again, so that he [Paul] would not have one sadness 
over the other. Therefore, the apostles suffered spiritual 
afflictions in addition to the outward physical afflictions. 

But why does Paul say that he was not despised by 
the Galatians? Certainly they despised him, because 
they had fallen away from his gospel. Paul explains 
himself. He says: "When | first preached the gospel to 
you, you did not do as most other people did, who, 
angered by this weakness and temptation of mine 
according to the flesh, despised and rejected me. For 
human reason is easily angered by the smallness of the 
cross, and considers those nonsensical who want to 
comfort others, help others and advise others, likewise, 
who boast of great treasures, of righteousness, of 
strength, of victory over sin, death and all evil, of joy, of 
blessedness and eternal life, and yet are themselves 
meager, weak, sad and despised, are treated most 
shamefully and killed as the most harmful pestilence for 
the state and the service of God, and that not by the 
rabble, but by the nobles who have the administration of 
state and church; and these think that they are doing God 
a service by it [Joh. 16, 2.]. 

Therefore, since they promise eternal goods to 
others and themselves perish so miserably before the 
world, they are ridiculed and must hear: "Physician, help 
yourself" [Luc. 4:23]. 

1) spostoN is missing in the Jena and Erlanger. 


2) Latin: Appii forum et Tres tabernas, four 
Miles from Rome. 


Therefore these laments are everywhere in the Psalms 
[Ps. 22, 7.]: "lam a worm and no man" 2c. [Ps. 22, 12.): 
"Do not be far from me, for fear is near; for there is no 
helper here" 2c. 

This, then, is a glorious glory and praise for the 
Galatians, that they did not take offense at this weakness 
and challenge of Paul, but received him as an angel of 
God, yes, as Christ Jesus. It is certainly a great and 
excellent virtue to give ear to an apostle, but it is a 
greater and truly Christian virtue to hear such a 
miserable, weak and despised man (as Paul here 
testifies of himself that he was with the Galatians) and to 
receive him as an angel from heaven and to give him 
such honor as if he were Christ JEsus, and not to be 
vexed at his so great and many tribulations. Therefore, 
with these words he praises the virtue of the Galatians 
to the highest degree, of which he says that he will 
always remember it, and that it is so pleasing to him that 
he wishes it to be known to all men. 

But in the meantime, since he praises their good 
deeds and praiseworthy behavior so gloriously, he 
covertly shows how much they loved him before the false 
apostles came, and at the same time reminds them that 
they want to follow him as their apostle with the same 
love and reverence as before. 2c. And even from this it 
can be seen that the false apostles, as far as could be 
seen, had a greater reputation among the Galatians than 
Paul. For moved by this, the Galatians preferred them 
far above Paul, whom they had not only loved very much 
before, but had also received him as an angel of God 2c. 


v. 15: How blessed you would have been 
at that time! 


As if he wanted to say: How blessed you were 
praised, how you were praised and esteemed happy at 
that time! It is a similar way of speaking in the hymn of 
Mary [Luc. 1, 48.): "Blessed shall | be praised," that is, 
happy shall | be esteemed "by all the children's children." 
And these words, "How blessed you would have been 
then!" are very emphatic, 


552 Li-i. "Li. ii, 228-231. Explanation d. Galatians 4, 15. 16. w. vm, 2192-2495. 55Z 





as if he wanted to say: You were not only praised in 
general, but praised in all things and praised to the 
highest. 

In this way, he tries to soften the bitter drink, that is, 
the severe punishment and others, because he fears 
that the Galatians would take offense, especially since 
he knew that the false apostles would slander his words 
and interpret them maliciously. For this is the virtue and 
the manner of such vipers, that they suspect the words 
which have come from a godly and sincere heart, and 
cunningly and deceitfully turn them to the very opposite 
opinion than they were spoken. In this they are 


marvelous masters, far surpassing the gifts (ingenium) 
and skill of all orators. For they are driven by the spirit of 


malice (spiritu. maligno), which makes them so 
nonsensical that, inflamed by satanic bitterness against 
the godly, they must interpret their words and writings 
maliciously. Therefore they do just like spiders, which 
suck poison from the most beautiful and best flowers, 
which is their fault, not the flowers’. That is why he wants 
to anticipate with his honey and friendly treatment 


(blanditie), so that the false apostles will not have the 
opportunity to slander and to pervert his words 
captiously in this way: Paul treats you unkindly; he calls 
you unintelligent, bewitched, disobedient to the truth, 
which is a certain sign that he does not seek your 
blessedness, but considers you to be people who are 
condemned and rejected by Christ. 


Iam your witness that if it had been possible, you 
would have plucked out your eyes and given them to 
me. 


He praises the Galatians beyond measure. He says: 
"You have not only treated me with the greatest 
kindness and reverence, receiving me as an angel of 
God, 2c., but if the circumstances and the need had 
required it, you would also have plucked out your eyes 
and given them to me, yes, you would also have risked 
your life for me. And surely the Galatians would also 
have risked their lives for him. For since they received 
Paul and kept him, whom the whole world considered to 
be the most wicked, accursed, and wicked of all men, 
they would not have given their lives for him. 





As people who accepted and defended Paul, they 
incurred the displeasure and hatred of all Gentiles and 
Jews. 

Thus, the name of Luther is the most hated in the 
world today. He who praises me sins more grievously 
than any idolater, blasphemer, perjurer, fornicator, 
adulterer, murderer, thief 2c. Therefore, the Galatians 
must have been well grounded in the doctrine and faith 
of Christ, since they accepted Paul and stood by him, 
even though he was hated by the whole world, and thus 
exposed themselves to great danger. Otherwise they 
would not have incurred the hatred of all men 2c. 


V. 16. Have I then become your enemy, to 
reproach you with the truth? 


Here he shows the reason why he gives the 
Galatians such good words. For he assumes that they 
consider him to be their enemy because he has 
punished them so severely. | beg you, he says, separate 


my punitive words (convicia) from my teaching, and you 
will find that | did not go about heaping reproaches on 
you, but teaching you the truth. | confess that my epistle 
is sharp, but the purpose of this sharpness is to bring 
you back to the truth of the gospel, from which you have 
been led astray, and to keep you in it. Therefore, do not 
take this sharpness and bitter drink to your persons, but 
assume that it is directed against the disease, and do 
not consider me your enemy because | have scolded 
you a little harshly, but your father. For if | did not love 
you very much as my children, and if | knew that | had 
been very dear to you, | would not have scolded you so 
harshly. 

226 It behooves a friend to admonish his friend freely 


when he acts wrongly in something; and he who is 
admonished when he is otherwise sensible does not 
resent the other for admonishing him kindly and telling 
him the truth, but is and proves grateful. In the world it is 
quite common to be hated for telling the truth, and he is 
considered an enemy who does not know the truth. 


554 Ari- VA. Il, 231-233. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2495-2499. 


truth. This does not happen among friends, much less 
among Christians. 

227 Since | have punished you out of pure love to 
keep you in the truth, you must not be angry with me, nor 
forsake the truth for the sake of my fatherly punishment, 
nor suspect that | am your enemy 2c. All this Paul says 
to confirm the word: "Be ye even as | am; ye have done 
me no hurt" 2c. 


V. 17. They are not jealous of you. 


Here Paul attacks the flattering nature of the false 
apostles. For with wonderful art and cunning Satan uses 
his servants to deceive the simple, as Paul says Rom. 
16, 18, by sweet speeches and glorious promises. First, 
they swear by all that is holy that they seek nothing else 
than to promote the glory of God; likewise, that they are 
driven by the Spirit, because they see that the poor 
people are neglected, or at least not properly taught by 
others in word, to teach the very certain truth, so that the 
elect may in this way be freed from error and come to 
the true light and knowledge of the truth. Then they 
promise blessedness to those who accept their teaching 
2c. Through this pretense of godliness and the sheep's 
clothing, the ravening wolves do great harm to the 
congregations, unless vigilant and faithful shepherds 
resist them. 

229. Paul uses here the figure of speech of 
anticipation (occupatione) [of the objections of the 
opponent). For the Galatians could have said: Why do 
you attack our teachers in such a way that they seek to 
draw us to themselves (nos ambiunt), since they do this 
out of a godly zeal and out of pure love? surely you 
should not be angry at this 2c. On the other hand, Paul 
says: They seek to win you to themselves, but not in 
good opinion (bene). 

230 So nowadays we have to hear from the 
Sacramentarians that we separate the love and unity of 
the churches by our stubbornness, by rejecting their 
doctrine of the Lord's Supper. They say that it would be 
better for us to be a little lenient (especially since there 
is no danger here), rather than to fight for 


555 


for the sake of this single article, which, moreover, would 
not be a main article, caused such great discord and 
strife in the church, especially because they did not differ 
from us in any other article of Christian doctrine than in 
this alone of the Lord's Supper. To this | reply: Cursed 
be love and concord, because of which God's word is 


given (periclitatur) to preserve them. 

Thus the false apostles pretended that they loved the 
Galatians very much and cared for them with a certain 
godly jealousy. But the zeal is actually an enraged love, 
or, that | say so, a godly friction. In the first book of Kings, 
Cap. 19, 14, Elijah says: "| have been jealous for the 
Lord" 2c. In this way a husband is jealous for his wife, a 
father for his son, a brother for another, that is, he loves 
him very much, but in such a way that he hates the faults 
in him and seeks to correct them. The false apostles also 
feigned such zeal against the Galatians. 

232 Paul admits that they have an excessive love for 
the Galatians, that they are zealous and concerned 
about them, but not in good faith. And by this pretense 
and pretense the simple are deceived that these 
deceivers pretend a burning love and concern for others. 
So here Paul reminds us to make a distinction between 
a good zeal and an evil zeal. A good zeal is certainly 
praiseworthy, but not in the same way an evil one. |, says 
Paul, am as zealous for you as they are. Now judge 
which zeal is better, mine or theirs, which of the two is 
good and godly, which is evil and carnal. Therefore, let 
not their zeal move you so easily, for: 


They want to make you disparaged by me, that 
you should be jealous for them. 


233 As if to say: They are burning with too much zeal 
and love for you, but by this they seek that you in turn 
should be jealous for them and become disgusted with 
me. If their zeal were godly and sincere, they would 
certainly suffer us to be loved by you at the same time 
as them. But they hate our doctrine, therefore they desire 
that the same be destroyed among you in every way, 
and that their doctrine be spread among you, and for the 
sake of 


556 Lri.kai. Il, 233-235. Explanation of Galatians 4, 17, W. VIII, 2499-2502. 


557 





To accomplish this the more conveniently, they 
endeavor to alienate you from us by this zeal and to 
make you hostile, so that you may hate us at the same 
time as our doctrine and direct your zeal and endeavor 
toward them and love them alone and receive their 
doctrine. Thus he makes the Galatians suspect the false 
apostles, precisely by saying that they are pursuing 
them under the most beautiful pretense and deceiving 
them. Thus Christ warns us by saying [Matth. 7, 15.]: 
"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's 
clothing" 2c. 

234 Paul suffered the same challenge that we suffer 


today. This disorderly nature (indignitas) hurt him very 
much, that he had to see that his exceedingly good 
teaching was followed by so many mobs, so many 
rebellions, disruption in the world order, change of the 
kingdoms 2c., from which innumerable troubles and 
annoyances arise. He is accused by the Jews in the Acts 
of the Apostles [Cap. 24. 5.), that he is a harmful man, 
who causes turmoil for his people on the whole earth, 
and that he is a prominent one of the sect of the 
Nazarenes, as if they wanted to say: He is a rebellious 
and blasphemous man, who preaches such things, by 
which he not only reverses the Jewish state, which is 
best ordered by divine laws, but also abolishes and 
tears apart even the holy ten commandments, religion, 
worship and our priesthood, and he spreads in the world 
the gospel (as he calls it), from which innumerable evils 
have arisen, riots, agitations and sects. He has to hear 
the same from the Gentiles who are crying out in the city 
of Philippi [Apost. 16, 20. f.] that he is misleading their 
city and proclaiming a way that is not appropriate for 
them to accept 2c. 

(235) Such disruptions in the world order and other 


calamities, famine, wars, discord and sectarianism, 
were then imposed by Jews and Gentiles on the 
teaching of Paul and the other apostles, and therefore 
they persecuted them as detrimental to peace and 
religion. But because of this, the apostles did not 
abandon their ministry, but carried it out courageously 
(strenue), preaching and confessing Christ. For they 
knew that one must obey God more than men. 





Apost 5:29], and that it is better for the whole world to 
be broken up and thrown into a heap than for Christ not 
to be preached or for even one soul to be neglected and 
lost. 

In the meantime, however, the apostles must have 
been extremely grieved by these astonishments, for 
they were not of iron. They were very concerned that the 
people, for whose sake Paul wanted to be banished 
from Christ, should go to their doom with all their 
adornment. They saw that great unrest and changes in 
all kingdoms would follow this teaching of theirs, and 
what was more bitter to them than death, especially to 
Paul, they saw that countless sects would arise during 
their lifetime. It was sad news for Paul when he heard 
that the Corinthians were denying to keep quiet about 
other things, that the dead were rising again, when he 
heard that the churches prepared by his ministry were 
being disrupted, that the gospel was being perverted by 
false apostles, that all of Asia and some great men were 
falling away from him. 

237 But he knew that his teaching was not the cause 
of these aversions and sects. Therefore, he did not lose 
heart, did not run away from his profession, but 
continued, knowing that the gospel he preached was the 
power of God to save all who believe in it [Rom. 1:16], 
even though it was considered a foolish and annoying 
doctrine by pagans and Jews. For he knew that those 
were blessed who did not take offense at this word of 
the cross, whether they were teachers or hearers, as 
Christ also says [Matt. 11:6], "Blessed is he who does 
not take offense at me." Again, he knew that those who 
judged this teaching to be foolish and heretical were 
damned. Therefore, trusting in his certainty of faith, he 
said with 
Christ against the Jews and Gentiles enraged by his 
teaching [Matth. 15, 14.]: "Let them go, they are blind 
guides for the blind." 

238 The same thing that once Paul and the other 
apostles have to hear, we also have to hear today, that 
the teaching of the gospel, which we confess, is the 
cause of many evils, as riots, wars, sects and 
innumerable troubles, 


558 


LI-1. 6ai. Il, 235-238. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2202-2506. 


559 





Yes, all the disorder that now exists is laid upon us. We 
certainly do not sow heresies and ungodly teachings, 
but preach the gospel of Christ, who is our high priest 
and redeemer. Furthermore, our adversaries, if they 
only want to confess the truth, must concede to us that 
through our teaching we have not given rise to uprisings, 
riots, wars, etc., but that we have taught that the 
authorities are to be served conscientiously for the sake 
of God's commandment and that they are to be held in 
all honor. Nor are we the cause of trouble, but the trouble 
of the wicked is not our fault, but theirs. We have the 
commandment of God that we should preach the 
doctrine of the gospel without regard to whether people 
are angry. Because the same condemns the ungodly 
doctrine and idolatry of the adversaries, they become 
irritated and produce from themselves arousal, which in 


the schools was called "accepted arousal" (scandala 


accepta), of which they said that one should not beware 
nor could beware. 

239. Christ taught the gospel and did not mind that 
the Jews were angry. "Let them go," he said, "they are 
blind. "2c. The more the chief priests forbade the 
apostles not to teach in the name of Jesus, the more 
they testified that this Jesus, whom they had crucified, 
was the Lord and the Christ, and that all who called on 
him would be saved, and that no other name under 
heaven had been given to men so that they could be 
saved 2c. [Acts 4:12.] 

240. In the same confidence we preach Christ today 
and do not turn to the cries of the godless papists and 
all our adversaries who complain that our doctrine is 
seditious and blasphemous because it endangers the 
existence of the commonwealth, overturns religion, 
sows heresies, and is, in short, a cause of all evil. When 
Christ and the apostles preached, the same cry was 
raised against them by the godless Jews. Not long after 
that the Romans came and took away their land and 
people, as they themselves had prophesied [John 
11:48]. Therefore, the enemies of the gospel today may 
be 





They must see to it that the evil they prophesy for 
themselves does not come upon them one day. 

241. they make these aversions exceedingly great, 
that the monks and priests take wives, that we eat meat 
on Friday 2c., But that they themselves with their 
ungodly doctrine daily deceive and corrupt innumerable 
souls, that they vex the weak with evil examples, that 
they blaspheme and condemn the gospel of the glory of 
the great God, that they persecute and kill those who 
practice the wholesome doctrine, this is no offense to 
them, but they consider it a service exceedingly pleasing 
to obedience and to God. Therefore let them go, for they 
are blind and blind guides. "Let him that is evil be evil 
continually, and let him that is unclean be unclean 
continually" [Revelation 22:11.]. But we will speak, 
because we believe, as long as there is breath in us, and 
will endure the persecutions of the adversaries until 
Christ our High Priest and King comes from heaven, 
which we hope will shortly come to pass, who as a 
righteous Judge will repay those who disobey fine 
Gospel, Amen. 

242 The godly do not contest these aversions to 
which the wicked refer. For they know that the devil 
hates the doctrine of godliness to the utmost and 
therefore disfigures it with innumerable aversions in 
order to completely eradicate it on this occasion. In the 
past, the devil did not rage like this when human statutes 
were taught in the church. For when the strong-armed 
man kept his palace, all that he possessed was in peace. 
But now, when a stronger one comes over him, who 
overcomes or binds this strong one, and snatches his 
house from him, he begins to rage and rage to the 
utmost. And this is the most certain sign that this 
doctrine which we profess is divine; otherwise the 
Behemoth would probably sleep and hide under the 
shadow, hidden in the reed and in the mud, Job 40:16. 
But now that he goes about like a roaring lion, and rages 
so much, it is a sign that he feels the power of our 
doctrine. 

243 Since Paul says, "They are jealous for you, but 
not in a good way,” 2c. he indicates in passing which are 
the originators of the sects, namely, the jealous spirits, 
which at all times have been the 


560 LI-l. "ai. II, 238-240. elaborates. Explanation d. Galatians 4, 17-19. 


W. VIII, 2506-2510. 561 





and disturb the public peace. For these, driven by a 
foolish zeal, dream that they have a peculiar holiness, a 


more suitable conduct (modestiam), greater patience 
and higher learning than other people, and therefore 
they have the confidence that they can help all men to 
blessedness, that they can teach higher and more 
wholesome things, establish better services and 
ceremonies than other teachers, whom they hold in low 
esteem, exalting their own reputation, and corrupting 
what those have taught in the right way. Driven by such 
foolish zeal, the false apostles set up mobs not only in 
Galatia, but everywhere where Paul and the other 
apostles preached, which were followed by countless 
uproars and very great disturbances. For the devil, as 
Christ says, is a liar and a murderer [Joh. 8, 44], 
therefore he not only uses his servants to confuse the 
consciences with false teachings, but also to stir up riots, 
wars 2c. 

Germany has a large number of such zealots today, 
who feign the greatest godliness, modesty, scholarship, 
patience, and yet in truth are ravening wolves, who 
intend nothing else with this hypocrisy of theirs than that 
we be put in the shadows and completely pushed aside, 
and that the people alone hold them in honor and hear 
and praise their teachings. Because they admire only 
themselves and despise other people, it cannot be 
otherwise than that mobs, quarrels, discord, riots 2c. 
must follow. But what shall we do? We cannot prevent 
this, any more than Paul could. Yet he won some who 
obeyed these exhortations of his. So | hope that also 
through our exhortations some will be brought out of the 
error of the 2c. 


V. 18. Zeal is good when it is always for good, and 
not only when I am present with you. 


245 As if to say: | have given you praise because you 
were most zealous for me and loved me very much, 
while | preached the gospel among you in weakness of 
the flesh. With the same love and 


You should have attached the same zeal to me even 
now that | am not with you, as if | had never left you. For 
even though | am absent in body, you still have my 
teaching. Since you have received the Holy Spirit 
through it, you must keep this teaching and think that 
Paul is always present with you as long as you have his 
teaching. Therefore, | do not rebuke your zeal but praise 
it, but | praise it only if it is a divine zeal or a zeal of the 
Spirit, not a carnal zeal. But the zeal from the spirit is 
always good, because it zeal for the good, but the carnal 
zeal does not. 

So he praises the Galatians' eagerness to appease 
their hearts so that they would patiently accept his 
punishment, as if he wanted to say: Receive my 
punishment for the best, for it does not come from an evil 
or angry heart, but from a sorrowful heart anxiously 
concerned for you. 

Here, too, is an example from the art of oratory 


(thetoricum exemplum), from which we are to learn that 
a godly shepherd should be concerned about his sheep 
and make every effort to keep them in the salvific 
doctrine and turn them away from the deceivers by 
means of bells, good words, and supplications. 2c. 


V.19. My dear children, whom I bear again with 
fears until Christ takes form in you. 


248 This is also an oratorical saying to soothe the 
minds of the Galatians with sweet and lovely words, 


which he caresses (dmoKopiotiKac) "little children" 
(filiolos). 


calls. All words are chosen to soften hearts and win their 
goodwill. 

The words: "which | give birth to again" are a simile. 
The apostles (as well as the schoolmasters, but in their 
own way) stand in the place of the parents. For just as 
the form of the body comes from them, so they form the 
form of the soul. But the form of the Christian heart is 
faith or the confidence of the heart, which grasps Christ 
and clings to him alone and to no other thing. A heart 
that has this confidence, that we are righteous for 
Christ's sake, has the proper character of Christ. 


562 uri. Kai. 11, 240-243. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2510-2513. 


563 





250 This form is prepared by the ministry of 
preaching, 1 Cor. 4, 15: "| have begotten you through the 
gospel," that is, in the Spirit, so that you might know 
Christ and believe in Him; likewise 2 Cor. 3, 3: "You are 
an epistle of Christ, prepared by our ministry and written 
by us, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. 
For the word goes forth from the mouth of the apostle or 
preacher and comes into the heart of the hearer. There 
the Holy Spirit is present and impresses the word on the 
heart so that it agrees with it. In this way, every godly 
teacher is a father who, through the service of the word, 
begets and forms the right shape of the Christian heart. 

251 Furthermore, with these words: "Which | give 
birth to again with fears", he also gives a side blow to the 
false apostles, as if he wanted to say: | have begotten 
you rightly through the gospel, but those corrupters and 
transgressors have come and made a new image in your 
hearts, not of Christ, but of Moses, so that your 
confidence is no longer in Christ, but in the works of the 
law. This is not the right form or the form of Christ, but a 
strange and completely devilish form. 

252 And he saith not, | bear you again, till my likeness 

be formed in you; but, Till Christ be formed in you. That 
is, | labor so that you may again obtain the likeness and 
image of Christ, not that of Paul. With these words he 
again aims at the false apostles. For after the likeness of 
Christ was blotted out in the hearts of the faithful, they 
formed a foreign likeness into it, namely, their own. "They 
desire," he says Cap. 6:13, "that ye should be 
circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh." 
He also speaks of this form of Christ in Col. 3, 10: "Put 
on the new man, who is being transformed into 
knowledge in the image of the one who created him. Paul 
wants to restore the likeness of Christ in the Galatians, 
which has been distorted and corrupted by the false 
apostles, which consists in the fact that they hold, think 
and want the same things that God, whose thought and 
will is that we should have forgiveness of sins and eternal 
life. 





through Jesus Christ, his Son, whom he sent into the 
world to be the propitiation for our sins and for the sins 
of the whole world, so that we might know through him 
that he is a reconciled and merciful Father. Those who 
believe this are like GOtte [Gen. 1, 26.], that is, in all 
things they think of GOtte as he is minded in his heart, 
for they have the same form in their hearts as GOtte or 
Christ. This means, as Paul says, to renew oneself in 
the spirit of one's mind and to put on the new man, who 
is created after God, Eph. 4, 23. 24. 

He says that he will give birth to the Galatians again, 
but in such a way that the form of the children is not that 
of the apostle, so that the children do not bear the image 
of Paul, Cephas 2c, but of another father, namely Christ. 
This, he says, | will form in you, that in all things you may 
be minded as Christ himself is minded. In short, | give 
birth to you, that is, | labor again with anxieties to bring 
you back to the former faith, which you, deceived by the 
wiles of the false apostles, have lost, and you have fallen 
back into law and works. Therefore a new and hard work 
is now upon me, to bring you back from the law to faith 
in Christ. This he calls giving birth 2c. 


V. 20. But I would that I were now with 
you, and that my voice might walk. 


These words are all expressions of the apostle's 
sorrow. It is commonly said that a letter is a dead 
message, because it cannot give more than it contains, 
and no letter is written so precisely that one should not 
still miss something in it. For there are different 
circumstances, and the things that matter (momenta) 
according to time, place, persons, customs and 
attitudes, are various, so that they cannot be described 
in any letter, and therefore a letter makes a different 
impression on the reader; sometimes it makes him sad, 
sometimes it makes him happy, depending on the 
reader's mind. But when one acts verbally, what has 
been spoken too harshly or carelessly can be 
interpreted, soothed and improved. 

256. therefore, Paul desires that he should have 
many-

He would like to be more present, so that he could 
moderate his voice and change it, depending on what 
he saw that the different attitudes of the people 


(circumstantias affectuum) required, so that if he saw 
that some people were in too much consternation, he 
could moderate his speech so that he did not make them 
too sad, and on the other hand, if he found arrogant 
people, he could punish them more severely, so that 
they would not become too sure and finally despisers. 

Therefore he does not know how to act as an 
absentee with absentees by letter, as if he wanted to 
say: If the letter is a little 1) too harsh, | fear that it will 
offend some of you more than better ones; if it is too 
mild, it will do nothing with some harsh and unintelligent 
people, because the dead letters and syllables only give 
what they contain. On the other hand, compared to a 
letter, the living voice is a queen, which can take away 
and add and direct itself according to every kind and 
condition of sentiments, times, places and persons. In 
short, | would like to convert you by letter, that is, to bring 
you back from the law to the faith in Christ, but | fear that 
| cannot accomplish this by dead letters. But if | were 
there in person, | could change my voice, rebuke the 
hard, speak kindly to the weak, according to all 
circumstances. 


For I am mad about you. 


That is, | am so distraught in my mind that | do not 
know what and how to do with you by letter, since | am 
absent. 

259 Here the right apostolic attitude is described. He 
does everything he can; he chides, he pleads with the 
Galatians, he gives them good words, he praises their 
faith with glorious words, and he acts with the greatest 
care and fidelity in this matter (that is, using the art of 
oratory correctly [rhetoricari]) in order to bring them 
back to the truth of the gospel and to turn them away 
from the false apostles. The words are not cold, but 
warm and fiery, therefore they must be carefully 
considered.

V. 21. Tell me, you who want to be under the law, 
have you not heard the law? 


Paul wanted to close this letter, because he did not 
want to write any more, but rather to be there personally 
and talk to the Galatians. But since he is distressed 
about this matter in his heart, he still makes use of this 


figurative speech (allegoria), which perhaps just 
occurred to him at that time. For by figurative speeches 


(allegoriis) and parables (parabolis) a great impression 
is made on the common man. Therefore, Christ also 
used them frequently. For this is like paintings, which 
show things to the simple, as it were, before their eyes, 
and therefore move the hearts very much, especially of 
ignorant people. So first he brings the matter to the 


Galatians (ferit aures Galatorum) by words and scripture, 
then he paints it before their eyes by this very impolite 
figurative speech. 

Paul, however, is a very good master in the art of 


treating spiritual interpretations (allegorias) correctly, for 
he tends to refer them to the doctrine of faith, to grace 
and to Christ, not to the law and works, as Origen and 
Jerome do. These are rightly censured because they 
have turned the simplest sayings of Scripture, in which 
spiritual interpretations do not take place, into 
inappropriate and unrhymed figurative speeches. 
Therefore, it is not good to imitate them in the treatment 
of spiritual interpretation, and in most cases it is even 
dangerous. For if someone does not have a perfect 
knowledge of Christian doctrine, he will not deal with 
spiritual interpretations in a profitable way. 

But why does Paul call the first book of Moses, from 
which he gives the history of Ishmael and Isaac, a law, 
since this book is not a law, and especially the passage 
he refers to does not contain a law, but only a simple 
narration of the history of the two sons of Abraham? 
According to Jewish custom, Paul used to call the first 
book of Moses a law, even though it contains no other 
law than that of circumcision, and teaches primarily faith, 
testifying that the patriarchs pleased God for the sake of 
faith. Nevertheless 


566 Lri. Sai. II, 245-247. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2519-2522. 


567 





The Jews called the first book of Moses together with 
the other books of Moses the law because of this one 
law of circumcision. The same was done by Paul, who 
was also a Jew; and Christ understands under the name 
"law" not only the books of Moses, but also the Psalms, 
Joh. 15, 25: "But that the saying might be fulfilled which 
is written in their law, They hate me without a cause." 
[Ps. 35, 19. Ps. 69, 5.] 


V. 22, 23 For it is written, Abraham had two sons; 
one of the bondwoman, and the other of the free 
woman. But he that was of the bondwoman was born 
according to the flesh: but he that was of the free 
woman was born by promise. 


263 As if he wanted to say: You forsake grace, faith 
and Christ, and fall away to the law. You want to be 
under it and be wise from it, so | want to talk to you about 
the law. Therefore, | ask you to look at it carefully. You 
will find that Abraham had two sons, Ishmael by Hagar, 
Isaac by Sarah. Both were true sons of Abraham; 
Ishmael was no less a true son of Abraham than Isaac. 
For both were begotten of the same father, flesh and 
seed. So what is the difference? The difference is not, 
says Paul, that the one mother was free, the other a 
maidservant (although this is useful for the spiritual 
interpretation), but that Ishmael, who was born of the 
maidservant, was born according to the flesh, that is, 
without promise and God's word, but Isaac was born not 
only of the free, but also through the promise. 

How is this? Isaac is born from the seed of Abraham 
in the same way as Ishmael. | admit that, both are 
children of the same father, and yet there is a difference. 
For although Isaac is produced from the flesh, 
nevertheless the promise and naming by God preceded 
it. No one would have noticed this difference if Paul had 
not indicated it. But he has taken it from the text of the 
first book of Moses in this way: The fact that Hagar 
conceived and gave birth to Ishmael was not the voice 
of God or His word, which was not the voice of God. 


But with the permission of Sarah, Abraham goes in to 
the maid Hagar, whom the barren Sarah, as the 1st book 
of Moses testifies, had given to him as a wife. For Sarah 
had heard that Abraham, according to God's promise, 
should have a seed from his womb. She hoped to be the 
mother of this seed. But since she had waited anxiously 
for many years after the promise, and saw that the 
matter was delayed, she thought she had been deceived 
in her hope. Therefore, the holy woman renounced the 
honor that was hers from her husband and her right, and 
entrusted this to another, namely her maid. But she does 
not allow him to take a wife outside of her house, but 
gives him her own maid in marriage, so that she would 
be built up from her. For so the history reports Gen. 16, 
1. 2.: "Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him nothing. But she 
had an Egyptian maid, whose name was Hagar. And 
she said unto Abram, Behold, the LORD hath shut me 
up, that | should not be able to bear. Dear, lie with my 
maidservant, whether | may build myself of her" 2c. 

It is a great humility that she let herself be brought 
down like this and bore this challenge to her faith with 
equanimity. She thought: God is not a liar; what He has 
promised to my husband, He will surely keep. But 
perhaps God does not want me to be the mother of this 
seed. | will not begrudge Hagar this honor; may my Lord 
come in to her, perhaps | can build myself from her. 

266 Ishmael is thus born without the word, only at the 
request of Sarah herself. For there is no word of God 
that would give Abraham the command or promise the 
son, but everything happens by chance. This is also 
indicated by the words of Sarah, who says, "Whether | 
may build myself out of her." Since therefore no word of 
God to Abraham preceded, as it happened when Sarah 
was to bear Isaac, but only the word of Sarah preceded, 
it is sufficiently indicated that Ishmael was the son of 
Abraham only according to the flesh, without the word, 
and therefore was expected and born by chance, like 
another child. Paul recognized this and carefully 
considered it.

22-25, W. VIII, 2523-2826. 569 





Paul strongly emphasizes the same reason for proof, 
Rom. 9, 6-9, which he repeats here, disguised under the 
figurative speech, and concludes powerfully that not all 
of Abraham's children are also God's children. 
Abraham, he says, has two kinds of children; some are 
born of his flesh and blood, but with the word or promise 
of God preceding them, like Isaac; others without 
promise, like Ishmael. So, he says, the children 
according to the flesh are not God's children, but the 
children of the promise 2c. 

268 And with this evidence he, like Christ Matth. 3, 9. 
and Joh. 8, 39. f., shut the mouths of the arrogant Jews 
who boasted that they were the seed and children of 
Abraham, as if he wanted to say: It does not follow: | am 
the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, therefore | 
am God's child; Esau is a natural son, therefore he is 
the heir. Yes, he says, those who want to be the children 
of Abraham must, in addition to being born according to 
the flesh, also be children of the promise and believe; 
and those who have the promise and believe are the 
true children of Abraham alone, and consequently also 
children of God. 

Because Ishmael was not promised by God to 
Abraham, he is a child only according to the flesh, not a 
child of promise, and therefore he was expected and 
born by chance, like other children. For no mother 
knows whether she will have children [or not], or if she 
feels that she is already with child, she does not know 
whether it will be a boy or a girl. But Isaac was most 
certainly named, Gen. 17:19: "Sarah thy wife," saith the 
angel unto Abraham, "shall bear thee a son, and thou 
shalt call his name Isaac." Here the son and the mother 
are expressly named. Thus God repays Sarah for her 
humility in forsaking her right and suffering the 
contemptuous treatment of Hagar, Gen. 16:4, with this 
honor that she herself shall be the mother of the 
promised son 2c. 


V. 24. The words mean something. 


270. the spiritual interpretations (allegoriae) do not 
provide solid proofs in theology, but decorate and 
explain a thing. 





as it were as a painting. For if Paul had not fortified the 
righteousness of faith with stronger grounds against the 
righteousness of works, this spiritual interpretation would 
be of no avail. But since he has fortified his cause above 
with the firmest grounds of proof, which are taken from 
experience, from the example of Abraham, and likewise 
from the testimonies of Scripture and parables, he now 
adds a spiritual interpretation as a kind of decoration at 
the end of the argument. For it is nice, when the 
foundation has already been laid in a reliable way and 
the matter has been firmly proven otherwise, that one still 
adds a spiritual interpretation. For as a painting is an 
ornament to a house already built, so the spiritual 
interpretation is a light for a speech or a thing already 
proved elsewhere. 


V. 24. 25. For these are the two testaments, one 
from Mount Sinai, which is born to bondage, which 
is Hagar. 1) For Hagar is called Mount Sinai in 
Arabia. 


Abraham is a figure of God; he has two sons, that is, 
two nations, signified by Ishmael and Isaac. These are 
born to him by Hagar and Sarah, who signify the two 
testaments, the old and the new. The old, which gives 
birth to bondage, is from Mount Sinai, which is Hagar. 
For the same mountain, which the Jews call Sinai (it 
seems to have this name from the brambles and thorn 
bushes), the Arabs call Hagar in their language. This 
testifies besides Paul also Ptolemy and the short notes 


(scho- lia) of the Greeks. In the same way also other 
mountains have other and different names with different 
peoples. Thus the mountain, which Moses calls Hermon, 
is called Sirion by the Sidonians, Senir by the Amorites. 
272. it agrees however beautifully together that the 
mountain Sinai according to the language of the Arabs 


1) Agar and Hagar is the same name. The difference of the 
spelling in the Old Testament (Gen. 16, 1. 2c.) and here (at least in 
many Bible editions) is due to the fact that the name is written "XXX" 
in Hebrew, but in Greek. Also in the Arabic root word (from which 
Hedschra or Hegira, Muhammed's flight, is derived) H is the initial 
letter. 


570 Lli. Oai. II, 250-2S2. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2526-2S29. 


571 





has the same name as the maid, and | believe that this 


similarity of the name brought Paul to it (dedisse lucem) 
and gave him the cause to look for this spiritual 
interpretation. Just as Hagar the maid bore Abraham a 
true son, who nevertheless was not an heir but a servant, 


so Sinai, who means Hagar (allegorica Agar), bore 
GOtte a true son, that is, a people according to the flesh. 
Likewise, as Ishmael was a right son of Abraham, so the 
people of Israel had the true GOD for their father; GOD 
gave them His law and entrusted His word to them, the 
religion, the worship, the temple, as the 147th Psalm 
says [v. 19.]: "He shows Jacob His word" 2c. 

But there was this difference: Ishmael was born of the 
maid according to the flesh, that is, without promise, and 
therefore he could not be heir. In this way, the symbolic 


Hagar (Agar mystica), that is, Mount Sinai, from which 
the Law was given and the Old Testament was 
established, gave birth to a people for God, the great 
Abraham, but without promise, that is, a carnal and 
servile people, who are not God's heirs, because the 
promises are not added to the Law, namely, from the 
blessing giver Christ, from the deliverance from the curse 
of the Law, from sin and death; Likewise, that our sins 
may be forgiven freely by grace, and that we may be 
given righteousness and eternal life. 18:5), "He that 
doeth these things shall live thereby." 

The promises of the law are therefore conditional, not 
promising life by grace, but to those who keep the law; 
therefore they leave consciences in doubt, because no 
one keeps the law. But the promises of the New 
Testament have no condition attached, nor do they 
demand anything of us, nor do they depend on the 
condition of our worthiness, but bring and give us free 
forgiveness of sins, grace, righteousness, and eternal life 
for Christ's sake. This is more widely done by us 
elsewhere. 

275 Therefore, the Law or the Old Testament 
contains only conditional promises, because it 





such acondition is always added to them: "If you will hear 
my voice", "if you will keep my covenant", "if you will walk 
in my ways", you shall be my people 2c. Not heeding this, 


the Jews seized upon these conditional promises and 


made them unconditional (absolutas) and pure promises, 
which GOD, they thought, could never revoke but must 
keep. Therefore, when they heard that the prophets (who 
could make a proper distinction between the physical 
promises of the Law and the spiritual ones of Christ and 
His kingdom) foretold the destruction of the city of 
Jerusalem, the Temple, the Kingdom and the priesthood, 
they persecuted and killed them as heretics and 
blasphemers against God, because they did not see the 
condition attached: If you will keep my commandments, 
it shall be well with you 2c. 

Therefore, the slave Hagar does not give birth to 
anything but a slave. Therefore Ishmael is not an heir, 
although he is the natural son of Abraham, but remains 
a servant. What is lacking? The promise and the blessing 
of the word. Thus the law given on Mount Sinai, which 
the Arabs call Hagar, produces only servants, because 
the promise of Christ was not added to the law. 
Therefore, O Galatians, if you forsake the promise and 
faith and fall away to the law and works, you will remain 
slaves forever, that is, you will never become free from 
sin and death, but will remain under the curse of the law. 
For Hagar does not give birth to the seed of promise and 
heirs, that is, the law does not justify, does not bring the 
childship and the inheritance, but rather hinders it and 
causes wrath. 


And tarry unto Jerusalem, which is at that time, 
and be servant with his children. 


This is a wonderful spiritual interpretation. As Paul 
made Hagar out of Sinai above, so now he would have 
liked to make Sarah out of Jerusalem, but he does not 
dare to and cannot, but he must connect Jerusalem with 
Mount Sinai, because he says that it [namely Jerusalem] 
is the 


572 Dri. Kai. Il, 22-2S4. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 4, 25. 26. W. VIII, 2529-2532. 


Hagar, since the mountain Hagar extends up to 
Jerusalem. And it is certainly true that there is a 


continuous mountain range from stony Arabia (Arabia 


petraea) to Kadeshbarnea in Judea. Therefore he says: 
The Jerusalem which is at this time, that is, the earthly 
and temporal, is not Sarah, but it belongs to Hagar, 
because in her the rule of Hagar is exercised. For in her’ 
is the law, which gives birth to servitude, in her is the 
worship, temple, kingdom, priesthood and everything, 
which is produced on Sinai from the Gefetz as a mother 


(ordinatum est), which goes to Jerusalem in the swing. 
Therefore | connect the same with Sinai and understand 
both under the same word, namely Sinai or Hagar. 

| would not have dared to treat this spiritual 
interpretation in this way, but would rather have said that 
Jerusalem is Sarah or the New Testament, especially 
since in this city the preaching of the Gospel began, the 
Holy Spirit was given, and the people of the New 
Testament were born, and would have thought that | had 
made out a very appropriate spiritual interpretation. 
Therefore, not every art expert can play with spiritual 
interpretations, because some beautiful appearance 
easily deceives someone into going astray, so that here 
none of us would not have thought it very appropriate that 
Sinai be called Hagar, and Jerusalem Sarah. But Paul 
makes Jerusalem Sarah, but not this physical one, which 
he assigns to Hagar, but the spiritual and heavenly one, 
in which the law does not reign, nor even a carnal people, 
as in Jerusalem, which is servile with its children, but in 
which the promise reigns and is a spiritual and free 
people. 

And so that the law and the whole kingdom, which 
was ordered on Hagar 1) would be completely taken 
away, the earthly Jerusalem with all its adornment, 
temple, worship 2c. was terribly destroyed under God's 
permission. But although there the New Testament took’ 
its beginning and from there went out into the whole 
world, it was not possible for the 


1) from Hagar - on Mount Sinai. 


573 


Nevertheless, it belongs to Hagar, that is, it is a city of 
law, worship and priesthood established by Moses. In 
short, it is born of the handmaid Hagar and therefore 
servile with its children, that is, it walks in works of the 
law and never comes to the freedom of the spirit, but 
remains constantly under the law, sin, evil conscience, 
wrath and judgment of God, under the guilt of death and 
hell. It has indeed freedom according to the flesh, it has 
authority, wealth, possession 2c., but we are talking 
about the freedom of the spirit, where we, having died to 
the law, sin, death, live and reign freely in grace, 
forgiveness of sins, righteousness and eternal life. The 
earthly Jerusalem cannot achieve this, therefore it 
remains with Hagar. 


V. 26. But the Jerusalem that is above is the free 
one, the mother of us all. 


280 The earthly Jerusalem, he says, which is below 


and has a legal government (politiam), is Hagar, and is 
servant with her children, that is, is not freed from the 
law, from sin and from death. But the Jerusalem that is 
above, that is, the spiritual, that is Sarah (yet Paul does 


not add the proper name [nomine proprio] Sarah, but 


calls her by a generic name [appellative] "the free one"), 
that is, the right mistress and the free one and our 
mother, who gives birth, not to bondage, like Hagar, but 
to freedom. But it is the heavenly Jerusalem that is 
above, the Church, that is, the faithful scattered 
throughout the earth, who have the same Gospel, the 
same faith in Christ, the same Holy Spirit, and the same 
Sacraments. 

281 Therefore you do not have to understand the 
word "above", as the sophists do, from the ultimate goal 
(avaymytyas), 7) from the trium 
The church in heaven is said to be the church in heaven, 
but the church on earth is said to be the church on earth. 
And it is not to be wondered at that it is said of the godly 
that they have their walk in heaven, as it is said Phil. 3, 
20.: "Our walk is in heaven"; not to the place

after, but, inasmuch as a Christian believes, inasmuch 
as he takes hold of the unspeakable, heavenly, and 
eternal gifts, inasmuch is he in heaven, Eph. 1:3: "Who 
hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly 
things through Christ." 

Therefore, the spiritual and heavenly blessing must 
be distinguished from the earthly blessing, which 
consists in having a good world and house government, 


having offspring, peace, goods, food (fruges) and other 
bodily necessities. But the heavenly blessing is that one 
may become free from the law, from sin and death, 
become righteous and alive, have a reconciled God, 
have a confident heart, a joyful conscience, spiritual 
comfort, that one may have the knowledge of Christ, the 
prophecy and revelation of the Scriptures, that one may 
have the gifts of the Holy Spirit, rejoice in God 2c. These 
are the spiritual blessings that Christ bestows upon His 
Church. 

283 Therefore, "the Jerusalem that is above," that is, 
the heavenly Jerusalem, is the church at this time; not 


that to which it shall eventually come (dvaywyixas), the 
fatherland in the 
future life or the triumphant church, as the idle and 
unlearned monks and the scholastic teachers have 
fooled. 

284. They have taught that the Scriptures have four 


kinds of meaning: The literal, the moral (tropologicum), 
the (allegoricum) the deeper 


(anagogicum) sense, 1) and according to this they have 
interpreted almost every word of Scripture in an 
inconsistent manner; as, Jerusalem in the literal sense 
meant to them the city of that name, in the moral sense 
a pure conscience, according to the spiritual 
interpretation the contending church, according to the 
deeper sense the heavenly fatherland or the triumphant 
church. By these tasteless and foolish fables, with which 
they led and tore apart the Scriptures in so many ways, 
they made it so that the consciences could not be 
properly instructed in any matter. 

284 But Paul says here that the old and earthly 
Jerusalem belongs to Hagar and serves with its children 
and is finished, but the new and heavenly Jerusalem, 
which is the 


allegorical and

Let our Mother, the Lady and the Free One, be appointed 
by God, not in heaven, but on earth, so that she may be 
the mother of all of us, from whom we were born and are 
still being born every day. Therefore, this mother of ours, 
as well as her offspring, must necessarily be on earth 
among men. But she gives birth spiritually through the 
service of the Word and the sacraments, not according to 
the flesh. 

| say this so that we may not be led by our thoughts 
into heaven, but know that Paul contrasts the Jerusalem 


which is above with the earthly, not in place (localiter), 


but in spirit (spiritualiter). For there is a great difference 
between spiritual and bodily or earthly things; the spiritual 
are "above," the earthly below. Thus the Jerusalem which 
is above is distinguished in contrast to the carnal and 
temporal Jerusalem which is below, not according to 
place, as | have said, but spiritually. For the spiritual 
Jerusalem, which had its beginning in the physical 
Jerusalem, does not have a certain place, like the one in 
Judea, but is spread over the whole earth and can be in 
Babylon, in Turkey, in Tartary, in Scythia [Russia], in 
India, in Italy, in Germany, on the islands of the sea, on 
mountains and in valleys, and everywhere on earth 
where there are people who have the gospel and believe 
in Christ 2c. 

Therefore, Sarah or Jerusalem, our free mother, is the 
Church, Christ's bride, from whom we are all born. She 
gives birth to children without ceasing until the end of the 
world by carrying out the ministry of the Word, that is, by 
teaching and propagating the Gospel, for that is to give 
birth. She teaches the gospel in such a way that we are 
set free from the curse of the law, from sin, death and all 
evil, not through the law and works, but through Christ. 
So the Jerusalem that is above, that is, the Church, is not 
subject to law and works, but is free and a mother without 
law, sin and death. Of the same nature as she, the 
mother, is, so are the children she gives birth to. 

This spiritual interpretation therefore teaches very 
beautifully that the church should do nothing but that.

_W. VIII, 2536-2539. 577 





teach the gospel rightly and purely, and thus give birth 
to children. Thus we are all fathers and children among 
ourselves, for we are born one of another. |, who am 
born of others through the gospel, now give birth to 
others, who then give birth to others, and so this giving 
birth will continue until the end of the world. 

But | speak of birth, not of Hagar, the maidservant, 
who through the law gives birth to servants, but of Sarah, 
the free woman, who gives birth to heirs without law, 
without works and own efforts. For that Isaac, not 
Ishmael (although both were sons of Abraham in the 
flesh), is heir, he has by the word of promise, namely 
[Gen. 17:19, 1: "Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, 
and thou shalt call his name Isaac. "2c. And Sarah 
understood this very well, and for this reason says [Gen. 
21, 10.], "Drive out this maid with her son" 2c., and Paul 
also cites these words afterwards [Gal. 4, 30.] 

Therefore, just as Isaac has the inheritance of the 
Father by promise and birth alone, without law and 
works, so we are born heirs through the gospel, of Sarah 
the free, that is, of the Church. For she teaches, nurtures 
and cares for us, carries us in her womb, in her womb 
and in her arms, forms and perfects us into the likeness 
of Christ, until we grow into a perfect man 2c. This is how 
everything happens through the ministry of the Word. 
Therefore it is the duty (officium) of the free woman to 
bear children to her husband, God, without ceasing, that 
is, such children as know that they are justified by faith, 
not by law. 


027 For it is written, Be thou merry, thou 
barren that bearest not, and break forth, and call, 
thou that conceivest not: for the lonely woman hath 
many more children than she that hath the man. 

291 Paul quotes this saying from the prophet Isaiah, 
which is entirely figurative. Thus it is written, he says, 
that the mother of many children, and she that hath one 
husband, shall decrease and perish; but she that is 
barren, and she that beareth not, shall have many 
children. In the same way 


Hanna also sings [1 Sam. 2, 4. f.] in her song of praise, 
from which Isaiah took this prophecy: "The bow of the 
strong is broken, and the weak are girded with strength. 
They that were full were sold for bread, and they that 
famished hungered no more: until the barren woman 
bare seven, and she that had many children was 
diminished. "2c. It is a wonderful thing, he says, she who 
was fruitful will be barren, and she who was barren will 
be fruitful. Likewise, they that were strong, full, living, 
righteous, blessed, rich, and glorious, shall be weak, 
scanty, subject to death, sinners, damned, poor, and 
without glory; and again, the weak and hungry 2c. shall 
be strong and full 2c. 

By this figurative speech of the prophet Isaiah, Paul 
shows the difference between Hagar and Sarah, that is, 
between the synagogue and the church, or between the 
Law and the Gospel. The law, the man of the fruitful, that 
is, the synagogue, begets very many children. For men 
at all times, not only the ignorant, but also all the 
exceedingly wise and the best of men (that is, the whole 
human race with the exception of the children of the free) 
do not see or recognize any other righteousness, much 
less a more excellent one, than that of the law (but | 
understand by the name "law" all laws, human and 
divine). Therefore, when they follow the law and 
outwardly do its works, they make themselves believe 
that they are righteous. Although these are fruitful, have 
many disciples, and can show much in righteousness 


and apparent works (floreant), they are not free, but 
servants, because they are children of Hagar, who gives 
birth to servitude. But if they are servants, they will not 
be able to share in the inheritance, but will be cast out of 
the house, because servants do not remain in the house 
forever, indeed, they are already cast out of the kingdom 
of grace and freedom. For he who does not believe is 
already judged. So they remain under the curse of the 
law, under sin, death and the power of the devil, under 
God's wrath and judgment. 

But if even the moral law of God, or the holy ten 
commandments, are only servants 





578 Lui. vai. Il, 259-261. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2539-2543. 


579 





that is, does not justify, but only terrifies, accuses, 
condemns, and drives the consciences into despair, 
how, | pray you, could human statutes and the laws of 
the pope, which are doctrines of the devil, make 
righteous? Therefore, all those who teach human 
statutes or the law of God and insist on them as 
necessary for righteousness before God, do nothing but 
witness servants 2c. And yet such teachers are 
considered the best, they reap the applause of the world 
and are very fruitful mothers, for they have disciples 
without number. Since reason does not understand what 
faith and true godliness are, it neglects and despises 
them and naturally takes pleasure in superstition and 
hypocrisy, that is, in the righteousness of works. 
Because this shines the most and goes in the swing, she 
is the most powerful empress on earth. Thus those who 
teach the righteousness of works from the law beget 
many children who, though outwardly they appear to be 
exceedingly free and lean on various kinds of purity, are 
in conscience bound and servants of sin; therefore they 
must be cast out of the house and condemned. 

On the other hand, the free Sarah, that is, the true 
church, seems to be unfruitful, because the gospel, 
which is a word of the cross that the church teaches, 
does not shine as brightly as the doctrine of the law and 
of works, and therefore it has few disciples who adhere 
to it. Then this title is attached to it, that it forbids good 
works, that it makes idle and sluggish men, that it stirs 
up heresies and sedition, and is a cause of all evil; and 
therefore it seems to have no success or prosperity, but 
is all full of barrenness, abandonment, and despair. 

Therefore, the wicked are firmly convinced that the 
church cannot last long with its doctrine. The Jews were 
quite sure that the church, which the apostles had 
planted, would soon collapse, which they called by the 
hateful name "sect" [Acts 28:22]; for this is what they 
said [to Rome] against Paul: "Of this sect we know that 
it is contradicted at all ends." 

296 So also nowadays our adversaries; Dear, how 
often have they made themselves with their 





What hope did they have for the best, since they boasted 
that we would soon be oppressed at this time and soon 
at that time? Christ and the apostles were oppressed, 
but since they died, the teaching of the gospel spread 
further than when they lived. So the adversaries can also 
oppress us, but the word of the Lord will stand forever. 

297. Therefore, as much as the Church of Christ 
seems to be barren and abandoned, weak and 
despised, and suffers persecution from without, and has 
to hear that its doctrine is heretical and seditious, it alone 
is the fruitful one before God, which through the ministry 
of the Word gives birth to innumerable children, the heirs 
of eternal righteousness and life, who suffer outward 
persecution, but are completely free in spirit, and are not 
only judges over all doctrines and works, but also 
glorious victors over the gates of hell. 

Thus, the prophet [Isaiah] admits that the Church is 
struggling, otherwise he would not call her to be joyful. 
He admits that she is barren before the world, otherwise 
he would not call her a barren and lonely one who does 
not give birth; but before God, he says, she is fruitful, 
and for this reason he urges her to rejoice, as if to say: 
Though you are lonely and barren, and have not the law 
for a man, therefore you have no children. But rejoice, 
for although you are without the man, the law, like a 
manly virgin who has been abandoned (for he does not 
want to call her a widow), who would have a bridegroom 
if she had not been abandoned by him, or if the 
bridegroom had not been killed to her, - you lonely one, 
| say, and who are abandoned by your husband, the law, 
and are not subject to the marriage of the law, you will 
be a mother of innumerable children. 

Therefore, the people or the church of the New 
Testament is entirely without law (as far as the 
conscience is concerned), and therefore it seems to be 
abandoned before the world. But as much as it is 
apparently barren, without law and works, it is 
exceedingly fruitful before God and bears children 
without number, and free ones at that. By what? Not 


580 


Il, 261-264. Explanation of Galatians 4, 27, W. VIII, 2543-2547. 


581 





by the man, the law, but by the word and the Spirit of 
Christ, which is given through the gospel, she conceives 
and bears children and raises them. 

With this figurative speech Paul shows most clearly 
the difference between the law and the gospel; first, by 
calling Hagar the old testament, but Sarah the new; 
second, by calling the one the maidservant, the other the 
free woman; likewise, by saying that she who has a 
husband and is fertile will lose weight and be cast out of 
the house with her children, 1) whereas the barren and 
forsaken one will become fertile and bear children 
without number, namely heirs. These are the essential 
differences between the people of faith and the people of 
law. The people of faith does not have the law for a man, 
is not servant, is not born of Jerusalem, which is at this 
time, as its mother, but has the promise, is free and is 
born of the free Sarah. 

301 Thus he separates the spiritual people of the 
New Testament from the people of the law, saying that it 
is not the offspring of Hagar who has the man, but of free 
Sarah, who knows nothing of the law, and thus creates a 
people of faith, which is far above and apart from the law. 
If it is above and apart from the law, it follows that it is not 
justified by law and works, but only by spiritual birth, 
which is nothing other than faith. But as the people of 
grace have no law, nor can they have it, so the people of 
the law have not grace, neither can they have it. 

302 For it is impossible for the law and grace to exist 
at the same time. We must therefore either be justified 
by grace and forsake the righteousness of the law, or by 
the law and forsake grace and the righteousness of faith. 
It is a shameful and unfortunate loss if we lose grace and 
keep the law, but a blessed and salvific loss if we lose 
the law and keep grace. 


1) The Jenaer and the Erlanger have erroneously "fielt instead of: 
"fiei in the Wittenberger. 





We take all possible pains (because we see that Paul 
did this with the utmost diligence) that we may clearly 
indicate the difference between the Law and the Gospel. 
This is very easy as far as the words are concerned. For 
who does not see that Hagar is not Sarah, and that 
Sarah is not Hagar? Likewise, that Ishmael is not or has 
not what Isaac is or has? This can be easily 
distinguished. But in serious terror and in the battle of 
death, where the conscience has to wrestle with the 
judgment of God, that one can then say with firm 
confidence: | am not a child of Hagar, but of Sarah, that 
is, the law does not concern me, because Sarah is my 
mother, who does not give birth to servants, but to free 
ones and heirs, that is the most difficult thing. 

Thus Paul proved with this testimony of Isaiah that 
Sarah, that is, the church, is the right mother, who gives 
birth to freemen and heirs, whereas Hagar, that is, the 
synagogue, gives birth to many children, but to servants, 
who must be cast out of the house 2c. 

(305) Further, since this passage also speaks of the 
putting away of the law and of Christian liberty, careful 
attention must be paid to it. For as it is the highest and 
noblest article of Christian doctrine that we know that we 
are justified and saved through Christ, so it is important, 


in opposition to this (per anti-thesin), that the doctrine of 


the abolition of the law be held in the right way (probe). 
For this is very useful to fortify our doctrine of faith and 
to give our consciences a firm and reliable comfort, 
especially in serious terror, when we know that the law 
has been abolished. 

306 | have often said above, and now | repeat it again 
(for this cannot be sufficiently emphasized), that a 
Christian who takes hold of the benefits of Christ in faith 
has no law at all, but that the whole law is taken away 
from him, with its terrors and plagues. The same is 
taught here in the passage from Isaiah. Therefore, this 
is a glorious and comforting passage, which calls upon 
the barren and lonely to be joyful, who, according to the 
law, should have been laughed at or rather mourned.

sin, he does not despair because he believes in Christ, in 
whom he is baptized and has forgiveness of sins, 
cleansed by His blood. Since sin has been forgiven 
through Christ Himself, the Lord of the law (but forgiven 
in such a way that He gave Himself for it), the law, the

bare that you do not give birth" 2c., as if he wanted to 
say: Why are you so sad, since you have no cause to be 
sad? But | am barren and forsaken 2c. As much as this 
may be the case, since you do not have righteousness 
from the law, Christ is your righteousness. He became a 
curse for you and redeemed you from the curse of the 
law. If you believe in him, the law is dead to you, and as 
much greater is Christ than the law, so much better is 
your righteousness than the righteousness of the law. 
Then you are also fruitful, not barren, because you will 
have more children than the man has. 

The other abdication of the law is external, namely, 
that the secular (politicae) laws of Moses do not concern 
us, and therefore we do not have to bring them back on 


track (revocare in forum), nor bind ourselves to them in 
a kind of superstition, as some in earlier years wanted, 
who did not know this freedom. 

By the way, even though the gospel does not subject 
us to the judicial laws of Moses, it does not completely 
exempt us from obedience to all worldly laws, but 
subjects us in this bodily life to the laws of the 
government (politiae) under which we live, that is, it 
commands that each one obey his authorities and their 
laws, not only for the sake of punishment, but also for 
the sake of conscience. 13, 5. 1 Petr. 2, 13. f., and the 
emperor would not sin if he used some laws from the 
judicial laws of Moses, yes, he could use them freely. 
That is why the sophists are mistaken who say that the 
worldly laws of Moses are fatal according to Christ. 

(315) Nor are we bound to the ceremonies of Moses, 
much less to those of the pope. But because this bodily 
life cannot be entirely without ceremonies or customs, 
for there must be a certain outward discipline 
(paedagogia), the gospel permits that ordinances be 
made in the church about feasts, about times, about 
places 2c., so that the people may know on what day, at 
what hour, in what place they are to come together to 
hear God's word 2c. It allows that 





The lessons are arranged as in a school, primarily for 
the sake of children and the simple, so that they can be 
taught all the better. 

But it [the gospel] allows this for the purpose that 
everything in the church may be done honorably and 
properly, 1 Cor. 14, 40, not that those who keep such 
ordinances may thereby earn forgiveness of sins 2c. 
Above this, they can also be omitted without sin, if only 
this is done without the annoyance of the weak. 
Therefore it is an error to say that the Mosaic 
ceremonies are fatal after Christ is revealed; otherwise 
the Christians would have sinned by keeping the Feast 
of the Feast of the Feast and the Feast of Pentecost, 
which the ancient church ordered to be celebrated 
according to the model of the Mosaic law (although in a 
completely different way and for a different purpose). 

But Paul is speaking here primarily of the abhorrence 
of the moral law, to which one must pay attention. For 
he acts against the righteousness of the law in order to 
justify the righteousness of faith, and thus concludes: If 
grace alone, or faith in Christ alone, justifies, it follows 
that the whole law is utterly done away; and this he 
confirms with the testimony of Isaiah, in which he 
exhorts the barren and forsaken church to be joyful. For 
she seems to have no children born of her, nor any hope 
of having children, that is, she has no disciples, she is 
not applauded for preaching the word of the cross of 
Christ crucified, 2c. against all wisdom of the flesh. 

(318) But this, says the prophet, should not move and 
grieve you who are barren, but rather rejoice and be 
glad, because the lonely one has many more children 
than the one who has a husband. That is, she who has 
a husband and is multiplied by numerous offspring will 
decrease, but you, barren and lonely, will have children 
in abundance. 

319 But he calls the church barren, because her 
children are born, not by the law, works, or any human 
effort or power, but in the Holy Spirit through the word of 
faith. Since 


586 Art- 6ai. II, 268-271. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 28S4-2SS7. 


587 





is nothing else than a mere birth (pascentia), 
(operativ). The fertile, on the other hand, exert 
themselves and toil too much with the labor o 
childbearing (parturiendo), and there is only labor, not 
birth. But because they strive to attain the right of 


ria work He had to do with the first speech, to which he added the 


saying of the prophet Isaiah as an interpretation. Now he 


f [uses the story of Ishmael and Isaac as an example and 


for comfort. 


V. 29. But as at that time he who was born 


children and heirs through the righteousness of the law |according to the flesh persecuted him who was born 


or through their own righteousness, they are servants 
who never attain the inheritance, although they tire 
themselves to death with too much work, because they 
want to attain with their works, against the will of God, 
what God wants to give to the believers out of mere 
grace for the sake of Christ. The believers also do truly 
good works, but they do not become children and heirs 
through them, for this is granted to them by birth, but so 
that they, having already become children through 
Christ, may praise God and help their neighbor through 
their good works. 


But we, brethren, are the children of the promise 
according to Isaac. 


That is, we are not children according to the flesh like 
Ishmael and all Israel according to the flesh, who 
boasted that they were the seed of Abraham and the 
people of God, but had to hear about Christ, John 8:39 
ff: "If you were Abraham's children, you would not seek 
to kill me who told you the truth"; likewise, "If God were 
your Father, you would love me and know my language", 
as if he wanted to say: Brethren born and raised in One 
House, knowing one another's language, "ye are of the 
Father the devil" 2c. Such children, he adds, we are not, 
like them, who remain servants, and are finally cast out 
of the house, but we are children of the promise, like 
Isaac, that is, of grace and faith, born of the promise 
alone. About this matter, see above Cap. 3, 8. in the 
words: "In your seed shall all the Gentiles be blessed". 
So it is not by the law, works or our own righteousness 
that we are declared righteous, but by pure grace. Paul 
insists on this promise, which can only be grasped 
through faith, and often emphasizes it, because he sees 
that it is highly necessary. 

321 He has made it this far with the figurative 


according to the Spirit, so it is now also. 


This passage contains a very important consolation. 
All those who are born of Christ and live in Christ, and 
who boast of this birth and that they are God's heirs, have 
Ishmael as their persecutor. This is what we learn from 
experience nowadays, because we see that everything 
is full of turmoil, persecution, mobs and_ uproar. 
Therefore, we would not be able to endure the power and 
cunning plots of Satan if we did not fortify our hearts with 
this comfort of Paul and the like, and hold fast the article 
of justification without wavering. 

For who should not be offended by the cruel 
persecutions of the adversaries, and by the mobs and 
innumerable uproars which the zealots are stirring up 
today? It truly grieves us to hear that before the gospel 
began, everything was calm and at peace, but now that 
it has been proclaimed, everything is confused, the whole 
world is moved, and it collapses in on itself. When a man 
who does not have the Spirit hears this, he immediately 
becomes angry and judges that the disobedience of the 
subjects to the authorities, uprisings, wars, pestilence, 
famine, upheavals in the state, countries and kingdoms, 
mobs, upheavals and such like evils are without number 
and originate from the teaching of the Gospel. 

324 Against this exceedingly great trouble we must 
align ourselves and strengthen ourselves by this 
exceedingly sweet consolation that the godly must bear 
this name and title in the world, that they are rebellious, 


cause division (schismatici) and cause innumerable 
misfortunes. Hence it is that the adversaries think they 
have quite just cause, indeed, they are doing God a 
service by hating, persecuting and killing us. Ishmael 
therefore cannot do otherwise, he must persecute Isaac; 
but Isaac does not repay Ishmael like with like. He who 
persecutes 


588 Lri. Kai. Il, 271-273. Explanation of Galatians 4, 29. W. 


If you don't want to suffer the punishment of Ishmael, 
don't pretend to be a Christian. 

But, | beg you, let the adversaries, who exaggerate 
and exaggerate these evils today, tell us what good has 
followed the preaching of Christ and the apostles? Was 
it not followed by the destruction of the Jewish Empire, 
the disruption of the Roman Empire and disorder in the 
whole world? Not through the fault of the. Not through 
the fault of the Gospel, which Christ and the apostles 
taught for the salvation, not for the destruction of men, 
but, as the second Psalm says, through the fault of the 
Gentiles, the nations, the kings and the lords, who, 
because they were possessed by the devil, did not want 
to hear the word of grace, peace, life and eternal bliss, 
but abhorred and condemned it as a doctrine harmful to 
religion and the state. And that this would happen, the 
Holy Spirit, who was in David, prophesied long before, 
when he speaks [Ps. 2, 1. ff.]: "Why do the Gentiles 
rage" 2c. 

326 Such unrest and disruption of things is also seen 
and heard today. The adversaries put the blame on our 
teaching. But the doctrine of grace and peace does not 
stir up these disorders, but the heathen, the nations, the 
kings of the land, and the lords, as the second Psalm 
says, rage, speak in vain, rebel, and counsel, not against 
us, as they think, and 1) against our doctrine, which they 
accuse of being erroneous and seditious, but against the 
Lord and his anointed, and therefore all their counsels 
and undertakings are in vain, and shall be so henceforth. 
"He that dwelleth in heaven laugheth at them, and the 
Lord mocketh at them. 

327 Therefore, they may cry out as long as they want 
those movements to be stirred up by us, but the psalm 
comforts us and says that they themselves are the 
originators of such movements. They do not believe this, 
much less do they believe that they are raging, rebelling 
and counseling against the Lord and his anointed, but 
rather they make themselves believe that they are 
standing up for the Lord, defending his honor and 
rendering him a service by

pursue. But the psalm does not lie, and the outcome of 
the matter will prove this. We do nothing here, but suffer 
only because our conscience bears witness to us in the 
Holy Spirit. Then the doctrine for the sake of which such 
disturbances and upsets are caused is not our doctrine, 
but Christ's. We cannot deny this doctrine. We cannot 


deny it nor refrain from protecting it (patrocinium ejus 


deserere), since Christ says [Marc. 8, 38.]: "But whoever 
is ashamed of me and my words among this adulterous 
and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be 
ashamed of him" 2c. 

328 Therefore he that will teach Christ, and confess 
that he is our righteousness, must straightway hear that 
he is a pernicious man, which destroyeth all things. 
"These, who have stirred up the whole world (said the 
Jews about Paul and Silas Apost. 17, 6. 7.), have also 
come here, and act contrary to Caesar's 
commandment"; and Cap. 24, 5: "We have found this 
man harmful, and the sedition aroused all the Jews on 
the face of the whole earth, and a chief of the sect of the 
Nazarenes" 2c. In the same way the Gentiles complain 
Apost. 16, 20: "These people are making our city go 
astray" 2c. 

In this way they accuse Luther today of being a 
disturber of the papacy and the Roman Empire. If | were 
to keep silent, everything that that strong-armed man 
possesses would be at peace, and the pope would no 
longer persecute me. But in such a way the gospel of 
Christ would be obscured. But if | speak, the pope will 
be disgraced and fall away. | must lose either the pope, 
who is a mortal man, or the Lord Christ, who is eternal, 
and with him eternal life. But of two evils one must 
choose the least. Let the earthly and mortal pope fall 
rather than the heavenly and eternal Christ. 

Since Christ saw in the spirit beforehand that a very 
great change of conditions and a shaking of the world 
would follow from his preaching, he comforted himself in 
this way [Luc. 12:49]: "I have come to light a fire on the 
earth; what would | rather, for it was burning already! 
Thus we see that today the preaching of the gospel will 
be followed by many evils, because of the persecution

591 





We are so afraid of the blasphemy of the adversaries 
and the contempt and ingratitude of our people. This 
frightens us so much that we often think, according to 
the flesh, that it would have been better not to preach the 
doctrine of godliness, because then peace would have 
remained, than that now, when it has gone out, the public 
peace is disturbed. But according to the spirit we speak 
fearlessly with Christ: "| have come to light a fire on 
earth; what would | rather, for it was already burning!" 

331 But out of this kindled fire immediately arise 
exceedingly great movements, because not any king or 
emperor is challenged, but the God of this world, who is 
the most powerful spirit and the Lord of the whole world. 
This great opponent is attacked by this weak word that 
preaches Christ, the crucified. The Behemoth feels his 
divine power, stirs all his limbs, moves his tail and makes 
the deep sea boil like a pot, Job 41:23. This is where the 
raging and fury of the world comes from. 

332 Therefore, we must not allow ourselves to be 
challenged by the fact that the adversaries are angry and 
cry out that nothing good comes from the preaching of 
the gospel. They are unbelieving, blind and obdurate, so 
it is impossible for them to see any fruit of the gospel. On 
the other hand, we who believe (even though for a time 
we are oppressed by innumerable evils: we are 
despised, we are robbed, we are blasphemed, we are 
condemned, we are the sacrifice of all people, we are 
killed; and inwardly we are troubled by the [evil] 
conscience about sin and are tormented by the devils) 
see the immense and innumerable benefits and fruits of 
the gospel. For we live in Christ, in whom and through 
whom we are kings and lords over sin, death, the flesh, 
the world, hell and all evil, through whom we finally 
trample underfoot that dragon and basilisk who is the 
king of sin and death. In what way? By faith, because 


our treasure (bonum) is not yet revealed, which in the 
meantime we await in patience, and yet we already 
possess it with certainty through faith. 

333. that is why you have to change the article from 
the 





Learn justification carefully. He alone can raise us up 
against those innumerable vexations and comfort us in 
all temptations and persecutions. For we see that it 
cannot be otherwise than that the world is vexed by the 
doctrine of godliness and constantly cries out that 
nothing good comes from it, for "the natural man hears 
nothing of the Spirit of God, for it is foolishness to him," 
1 Cor. 2:14. He sees only outward evil, the overthrow of 
things, riots, murder, mobs 2c. He is angered by these 


Spectres, becomes blind, and comes to despise and 
blaspheme the word. 

We, on the other hand, must fortify ourselves, 
because the adversaries do not accuse and condemn us 
because of obvious shameful deeds, such as adultery, 
murder, robbery, 2c., but because of our teaching. What 
do we teach? That Christ, the Son of God, redeemed us 
from our sins and from eternal death by dying on the 
cross. So it is not life, but our doctrine, yes, not our 
doctrine, but Christ's doctrine that they contest. So it is 
Christ's fault that they dispute us, and the sin for which 
the adversaries persecute us was not committed by us, 
but by Christ. But whether they will cast Christ out of 
heaven because of this sin (yes, that would please 
God!), that he alone is our justifier and redeemer, and 
condemn him as a heretic and rebel, let them see for 
themselves. We command him this cause of his, and in 
the meantime we will cheerfully and safely watch which 
of the two will retain the victory, whether Christ or they. 

Though it grieves us in the flesh that our Ishmaelites 
hate and persecute us so fiercely, yet in the spirit we 
glory in our tribulations, both because we know that we 
suffer them, not because of our sins, but for the sake of 
Christ, whose benefits and glory we praise, and also 
because Paul has here previously armed us against this, 
saying that Ishmael must mock Isaac and persecute him. 

The Jews explain the passage of Ishmael, which Paul 
cites from the 21st chapter [v. 9] of the first book of 
Moses, that he was a mocker and persecuted Isaac. 


592 


Li-1. 6 "I. Il, 275-278. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 4, 29. W. VIII, 2554-2567. 


593 





in this way, namely, that Ishmael forced Isaac to idolatry. 
| do not reject this interpretation of theirs, but | do not 
believe that it was such a gross idolatry as the Jews 
dream, namely that Ishmael, after the manner of the 
pagans, made images of clay and forced Isaac to 
worship them; this Abraham would not have suffered in 
any way. 

Rather, | believe that Ishmael was a holy man on the 
surface, like Cain, who also persecuted and finally killed 
his brother, not because of any physical matter, but 
because he saw that he was preferred to him by God. 
Thus Ishmael also diligently embraced religion, offered 
sacrifices and practiced good works, and therefore 
mocked his brother Isaac, and wanted to be better than 
him in two ways; first, in religion and worship, secondly, 
also in civil rule and inheritance. And he thought he had 
a right to these two things, because he thought that he, 
as the firstborn, was entitled to the priesthood and the 


temporal rule (fegnum) according to divine right. 
Therefore, he persecuted Isaac spiritually, for the sake 
of religion, and physically, for the inheritance. 

This evil is always found in the church, especially 
when the doctrine of the gospel is in progress, namely, 
that the children of the flesh mock and persecute the 
children of the promise. The papists and the fanatics 
persecute us today for no other reason than because we 
teach that righteousness is given to us through the 
promise. For it grieves the papists that we do not worship 
their idols, that is, that we do not preach that the man- 


made means of acquiring righteousness (justitias), 
works and worship, do not serve to obtain grace and 
forgiveness of sins, and therefore they seek to cast us 
out of the house, that is, they boast that they are the 
church, children and people of God, to whom belongs 
the inheritance. 2c. They banish us as heretics and 
rebels, and if they can, they kill us in order to serve God 
2c. As much as there is in them, they reject us badly. 





However, from this life and the life to come. The 
enthusiasts hate us in the most hostile way, because we 
dispute and detest their errors and heresies, of which 
they continue to sow new ones in the church, and for this 
reason they judge that we are far worse than the papists, 
and therefore hate us more bitterly than the latter. 2c. 

Therefore, as soon as the word of God comes to light, 
the devil is enraged, and in his wrath he uses all power 
and deceit to persecute and completely eradicate it. 
Therefore, it cannot be otherwise, he must cause 
countless hordes and aggravations, also persecutions 
and murder. For he is a father of lies and a murderer. He 
spreads the lie in the world by godless teachers, by 
tyrants he kills the people. Thus he occupies both 
kingdoms, the spiritual and the corporal; the former by 
the lie of ungodly teachers (not to speak of the fact that 
he constantly incites each one in particular to heresies 
and ungodly opinions by his fiery darts), the latter by the 
sword of tyrants, and thus the father of lies and murder 
stirs up persecution on both sides, spiritual and corporal, 
against the children of the free. 

The spiritual persecution that we have to suffer today 
from the enthusiasts is very burdensome and quite 
unbearable for us because of the aversions with which 
the devil defaces our doctrine. For we have to hear that 
the sects of the Anabaptists and the Sacramentarians 
and all evil has arisen from this teaching of ours. The 
bodily persecution, in which the tyrants stand against us 


according to good and life (corporibus), is more bearable, 
because it does not happen because of our misdeeds 


(peccata), but because we confess God's word. 

We should learn from the title of the devil, "father of 
lies and murder", which Christ gives him Joh. 8, 44, that 
when the gospel is in progress and Christ reigns, corrupt 
sects inevitably arise and everything is full of the rage of 
murderers who persecute the truth. And Paul says [1 Cor. 
11, 19.), "There must be sects." Whoever does not know 
this is very easily angered and falls to 


594 


6-n. II' 278-286. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2567-2571. 


595 





The people leave their old God and faith, but they leave 
the true God and right faith. 

342 So Paul prepares the godly beforehand, so that 
they will not also be offended by these persecutions, 
sects, and aversions, by saying: "Just as at that time he 
was born according to the flesh," 2c. as if he wanted to 
say: "If we are children of the promise, born according to 
the Spirit, then we must in all certainty expect 
persecution from our brother who was born according to 
the flesh: If we are children of promise, born after the 
Spirit, then we must most certainly expect persecution 
from our brother who was born after the flesh, that is, not 
only the enemies who are openly ungodly will persecute 
us, but also those who were first our dear friends, with 
whom we were on intimate terms and lived in the same 
house, who received the teaching of the gospel from us, 
will later become our bitterest enemies, persecuting us 
most fiercely because they are brothers according to the 
flesh, who must persecute the brothers who are born 
according to the spirit. Thus Christ Ps. 41, 10. complains 
of Judas: "My friend in whom | trusted, who ate my bread, 
tramples me underfoot." But this is our comfort, that we 
have given no occasion to our Ishmaelites to persecute 
us. For the sake of the doctrine of godliness, the papists 
persecute us; if we recanted it, they would soon cease 
to persecute us. Likewise, if we approved the pernicious 
errors of the swarm spirits, they would praise us. But 
because we abhor the ungodly nature of both, they 
cannot help but hostilely attack and persecute us. 

343 But against this persecution and these vexations 
not only Paul, as | have said, prepared us beforehand, 
but also Christ himself, John 15:19 ff, comforts us most 
sweetly: "If ye were of the world," he says, "the world 
would have loved its own; but because ye are not of the 
world, but | have chosen you out of the world, therefore 
the world hateth you," 2c. as if he wanted to say, "Il am 
the cause of all the persecutions which ye suffer: | am 
the cause of all the persecutions which you suffer, and if 
you are killed, | am to blame for your loss of life, for if you 
did not preach my word and confess me, the world would 
not persecute you. But this is how it is with you: "The 
servant is not greater than his master. 





If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you 
for my name's sake" 2c. With these words, Christ lays all 
blame on Himself and frees us from all fear, as if to say: 
Not you, but my name, which you have preached and 
confessed, is the cause why the world persecutes you 
with violence and guile. "But be of good cheer, | have 
overcome the world" [Jn 16:33]. 

344 By this confidence we are sustained, not 
doubting that Christ is strong enough not only to endure 
all the violence of tyrants and all the wiles of heretics, but 
also to overcome them; and this he proved sufficiently in 
the case of the Jews and the Romans, whose tyranny 
and persecutions he endured for a time, and also 
endured the wiles of the heretics, but in his own time he 
overthrew and exterminated them all, and remained king 
and victor. Therefore, no matter how much the papists 
may rage nowadays, no matter how much the heretics 
may falsify and pervert the gospel of Christ, Christ will 
remain King forever, and the word of the Lord will endure 
forever, after all his enemies have been destroyed. 
Then, which is very comforting, the persecution of 
Ishmael against Isaac will not last forever, but only fora 
little while; when it is over, the verdict will be given as 
follows: 


V. 30. But what does the Scripture say? Cast out 
the maid with her son; for the son of the maid shall 
not inherit with the son of the free woman. 


345. This word of Sarah was very painful to Abraham, 
and when he heard this judgment, no doubt the fatherly 
love he had for his son Ishmael was very much opposed 
to it, because he was born of his flesh; and this is clearly 
testified by the Scripture Gen 21:11, when it says: "The 
word pleased Abraham very much, because of his son. 
But God confirmed the judgment that Sarah had made, 
and said to Abraham, "Do not let it displease you 
because of the boy and the maid. Obey all that Sarah 
has said to you. For in Isaac shall the seed be called 
unto thee." 

346 Here the Ishmaelites hear the verdict, 


596 Li. kai. 11, 280-283. Explanation of Galatians 4, 30. w. vill, 2571-2874. 


597 





This judgment has destroyed the Jews, Greeks, Romans 
2c. who persecuted the Church of Christ. It will also 
destroy the papists and all the works saints, whoever 
they may be, who today boast that they are God's people 
and the Church, and hope that they will certainly receive 
the inheritance, and consider us, who base ourselves on 
the promise of God, not only barren and lonely, but also 
heretical people who have been cast out of the Church, 
who could not possibly be children and heirs. But this 
judgment of theirs God reverses and passes judgment 
against them, that because they are children of the 
handmaidens and persecute the children of the free, 
they should be cast out of the house and have no 
inheritance with the children of the promise, to whom 
alone belongs the inheritance as children of the free. 

This judgment is firm 1) and irrevocable, because the 
Scriptures cannot be annulled. Therefore it will certainly 
happen that our Ishmaelites will not only lose the worldly 
and ecclesiastical dominion they have, but also eternal 
life, because the Scripture has foretold that the children 
of the handmaid shall be cast out of the house, that is, 
out of the kingdom of grace, because they cannot be 
heirs with the children of the free. 

348. But it is to be noted that the Holy Spirit, as it 
were, to shame, calls the people of the law and the doers 
of works "the son of the handmaid," as if to say: Why do 
you boast of the righteousness of the law and of works, 
and for this reason make yourselves out to be God's 
people and children? If you do not know from whom you 
were born, | will tell you: you were born of a slave girl as 
servants. What kind of servants? Servants of the law, 
therefore also servants of sin, death and eternal 
damnation. But a servant is not an heir, but is cast out of 
the house. 

Therefore, the pope with his entire kingdom and all 
other saints of works, however holy they may appear to 
be, who have the confidence that they are governed by 
laws, whether they be human or divine, 


1) rata - having become final. 


Grace and blessedness obtain, children of the 
handmaid, who do not obtain the inheritance with the 
children of the free, but are cast out of the house. And 
now | am not talking about the godless popes, cardinals, 
bishops and monks who have worshipped the belly as 
their god and committed terrible sins, which | do not like 
to name, but about the best ones, such as | have been, 
and many others who have lived holy lives and strived 
with the greatest work and effort to appease the wrath of 
God by keeping their order and to earn forgiveness of 
sins and eternal life. These hear here the verdict that 
they are children of the handmaid and are to be cast out 
of the house with their mother, the handmaid. 

(350) If we carefully consider such sayings, they 
make us certain of the doctrine and righteousness of 
faith and confirm us in it against the doctrine and 
righteousness of works, which the world accepts and 
esteems, while it despises and condemns the other 
[doctrine of faith]. This certainly moves and angers the 
faint of heart. Although they publicly see the impiety and 
unspeakable shameful deeds of the papists, they cannot 
easily be persuaded that so great a multitude, bearing 
the name and title of the church, should err, and only a 
few should stand right in the doctrine of the faith. 

351. And if the papacy still had the holiness and 
severity of life that it had in the time of the fathers, 
Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine and others, when the 


clergy (clerici) were not yet notorious for their trade in 


ecclesiastical offices (simoniam), for their splendor, their 
wealth, their treasures, their fornication, their sodomy 
and other sins without number, but lived according to the 


rules and regulations (canones et decreta) of the fathers, 


outwardly in a spiritual state (religiose) and holy, then 
also in a celibate state. Dear, what could we then do 
against the papacy? 

The celibate state, which the clergy strictly observed 
in the times of the Fathers, is something exceedingly 
glorious in the eyes of the world, for it makes a man an 
angel. 


598 All- (Zai. Il, 283-285. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2574-2578. 


599 





Therefore, Paul calls it Col. 2, 18. "spirituality of the 
angels" and the papists sing about the virgins: She led a 
life in the flesh like the angels, since she lived without 
flesh. 1) Then also the life, which they called a 
contemplative one, to which at that time the clergy gave 
themselves before all things, and did not take care of all 
worldly and domestic affairs, has a great appearance of 
holiness. Therefore, if the papacy today still had the 


same outward form (facies) as the old papacy, we would 
perhaps accomplish very little against it with our doctrine 
of faith, especially since we accomplish little now, when 
the old apparent godliness and strict discipline has long 
since vanished and one can see nothing in the papacy 
but a veritable cesspool and dung puddle of all vices. 


But even in the case that the old spiritual life (religio) 
and the discipline of the papacy still existed, we would 
still have to fight and speak against the works saints of 
the papal realm according to the example of Paul, who 
attacks the false apostles, who seem to be the holiest 
and best people: Even though you may lead a life of 
celibacy, and afflict your bodies with frequent 
mortifications, and even walk in the humility and 
spirituality of angels, you are still servants of the law, of 
sin, and of the devil, who must be cast out of the house, 
because you seek to attain righteousness and salvation 
through your works and not through Christ. 

For this reason, we must not turn our eyes both to the 
shameful life of the papists and to their ungodly doctrine 
and hypocrisy, which we also primarily condemn. We 


want to shred altogether that the spiritual life (religionem) 
and discipline of the old papacy would still be going on, 
and would be kept with the strictness with which the 
hermits, Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, Bernard, 
Franciscus, Dominic and many others observed it, we 
must nevertheless say: If you have nothing else to 
oppose the wrath and judgment of God, but holiness and 
chastity, then you must not be afraid of the wrath and 
judgment of God. 


1) Angelicam vitam duxerat in came, dum praeter carnem vixerat. 
As Menius indicates, sung "in sequence". On Sequenz, compare 
Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, 657. 





If you do not live a life of peace, you are clearly only 
children of the handmaid, who must be cast out of the 
kingdom of heaven and condemned. 

Even they themselves do not now defend their 
shameful life, which those who are the more intelligent 
among them abhor, but they fight to defend and preserve 
the doctrine of the devils, hypocrisy and righteousness 
from works. Here they claim the prestige of the concilia 
and the examples of the holy fathers, of whom they claim 
to have been the founders of the holy orders and rules 


(statutorum) 2c. 

Therefore, we do not fight against the papacy, which 
today is publicly ungodly and shameful, but against its 
most brilliant saints, who think that they lead a life like 
the angels, dreaming that they can not only keep the 
commandments of God, but also the counsels of Christ, 
and perform the works that they are not obliged to do, or 


superfluous good works (supererogationis). Of these we 
say that they lose effort and work if they do not take hold 
of the one thing that Christ says is necessary alone, and 
choose with Mary the good part that cannot be taken 
from them [Luc. 10, 42]. 

This was done by Bernard, a very godly, holy and 
chaste man, so that | think he is rightly preferable to all 
monks. Once, when he was seriously ill and had already 
despaired of his life, he did not put his trust in his celibate 
state, which he had led in complete chastity, or in his 
good works and godly deeds, of which he had done 
many, but put these far out of sight, took hold of Christ's 
good deeds in faith, and said: | have lived condemned, 
but thou, O Lord Jesus Christ, hast the kingdom of 
heaven by a twofold right; first, because thou art the Son 
of God, and secondly, because thou hast obtained it by 
thy suffering and death. This you keep for yourself 
according to the right of birth; this you give to me, not 
according to the right of works, but by grace. 

He [St. Bernard's] did not oppose the wrath and 
judgment of God with his monasticism and his angelic 
life, but rather he 


600 Oai. II, 285-287. Explanation of Galatians 4, 30. 31. W. 


VIII, 2578-2586. 601 





He took hold of the one thing that is necessary, and thus 
became blessed. | believe that Jerome, Gregory and 
other fathers and hermits were saved in the same way, 
and there is no doubt that also in the Old Testament 
many kings of Israel and other idolaters were saved in 
such a way, namely, they threw away their vain trust in 
idols at the hour of death and took hold of the promise of 
God in Christ, the future seed of Abraham, who would 
bless all nations. And if today some of the papists are to 
be saved, they must base themselves absolutely, not on 
their good works and merits, but solely on the mercy of 
God, which is offered to us in Christ, and say with Paul 
[Phil. 3, 9.]: "| have not my righteousness which comes 
from the law, but which comes through faith in Christ." 


V. 31 So then, brethren, we are not the 
children of the handmaid, but of the free. 


Here Paul concludes the figurative speech of the 
unfruitful church and the fruitful people of the law. He 
says: "We are not children of the bondwoman," that is, 
we are not under the law, which gives birth to bondage, 
that is, which terrifies, accuses and drives to despair, but 
we are free from it through Christ, so it cannot terrify and 
condemn us, 2c. of which enough has been said above 
[§ 31 ff]. Then, as much as the children of the handmaid 
persecute us for a time, this is our consolation, that they 
are finally thrust out into the utter darkness and leave us 
the inheritance. 


which is due to us as children of the free. 

Thus, as we have heard, Paul took the opportunity 
from the words "maidservant" and "free" to refute the 
righteousness of the law and to strengthen the article of 
justification. And with special diligence he took this word 
"the free" before himself, which he also still drives and 
makes great in the beginning of the following chapter, 
and thereby gets the opportunity to deal with Christian 
freedom, the right knowledge of which is very necessary. 
For the pope has completely eradicated it, and subjected 
the church to the most miserable and shameful bondage 
through human statutes and ceremonies. 

This freedom, which Christ has acquired for us, is 


today our strongest bulwark (praesidium), by which we 
defend ourselves against the tyranny of the pope. 


Therefore, the doctrine (locus) of Christian liberty must 
be carefully considered, both to fortify the doctrine of 
justification, and to raise and comfort consciences 


against so many turbationes and aversions, which, as 
the adversaries say, derive from the Gospel. But 
Christian liberty belongs to a great extent to spiritual 


things (est valde spiritualis res), which the natural man 
does not hear; indeed, those who have the firstfruits of 
the Spirit, and can teach about them in many words, 
hardly keep them in their hearts. Reason seems not to 
care much about it; therefore, unless the Holy Spirit 
makes it great and important, it is despised. 


The fifth chapter. 


Since Paul wants to close the letter soon, he speaks 
violently and fervently to defend the doctrine of faith and 
Christian freedom against its enemies and destroyers, 
the false apostles, against whom he hurls loud words of 
thunder to throw them to the ground. 


At the same time he exhorts the Galatians that they 
should avoid the harmful teaching of the same as a 
pestilence, and in exhorting them he lets threats and 
promises flow in, leaving no stone unturned to preserve 
them in the liberty which Christ has purchased for them, 
saying: 


602 Lri. 6-u. Il, 287-288. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2586-2S8S. 


603 





V. i. Stand therefore in liberty, that 
Christ may set us free. 

2 That is, be firm. Thus Peter says [1 Ep. 5:8], "Be 
sober and watchful, for your adversary the devil walketh 
about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 
Resist him firmly in the faith." He says, Be not sure, but 
firm; lie not down, or sleep, but stand, as if he would say: 
To this end watchfulness and constancy are necessary, 
that ye may keep the liberty wherewith Christ hath set us 
free; secure and snoring men cannot keep it. For Satan 
has a mighty hatred against the light of the gospel, that 
is, the doctrine of grace, liberty, comfort, and life. 
Therefore, when he sees it rising, he immediately 
opposes it with all winds and storms to dampen it. 
Therefore, Paul reminds us that the godly must not snore 
nor be secure, but must be well equipped to fight 
valiantly against Satan, lest he take away the freedom 
that Christ has purchased for them 2c. 

But there is a special emphasis on every single word. 
"Stand firm," he says, as if to say: Vigilance is necessary 
here. "In freedom." In what? Not in the freedom by which 
the emperor, but Christ, has set us free. The emperor 
has given the Roman Pontiff the city of Rome and other 
lands freely, likewise freedom from — services 


(immunitates), privileges (privilegia), freedom from 
taxes (indulta) 2c. This is also a freedom, but a civil one, 


by which the Roman pope with his clerics (clericis) is 
made free from public burdens. 

4 Then there is also a freedom of the flesh, or rather 
of the devil, by which he rules primarily in the whole 
world. For those who have this freedom obey neither 
God nor the laws, but do as they please. This freedom is 
pursued nowadays by the rabble, and also by the 
enthusiasts, who want to be free in their opinions and in 


their actions, so that they may teach and do with impunity 


what they dream is right. These exist in the freedom with 
which the devil has freed them. 








(5) We do not deal with this, although the whole world 
seeks it alone and chases after it. Nor do we speak of 


freedom in the worldly sense (politica,) but of another, 
which the devil hates and disputes beyond measure. It is 
that "that Christ might deliver us," not from any human 
servitude, or from Babylonian or Turkish captivity, but 
from eternal wrath. Where? In the conscience. Here our 
freedom stops and goes no further. For Christ has not 
made us civilly, not carnally free, but theologically or 
spiritually free, that is, he has made us so free that our 
conscience is free and joyful, and does not fear the wrath 
to come. This is the very real and inestimable freedom, 
against whose greatness and glory the other freedoms 
(the secular and the carnal), when compared to it, are 


hardly a droplet (stilla) or a stick (guttula). 

(6) For who can say in words how great it is that 
someone can be sure that God will neither be angry nor 
ever be angry, but that He will be His gracious and kind 
Father forever for the sake of Christ? This is truly a great 
and incomprehensible freedom, that we have this 
supreme majesty for ourselves, that it graciously 
celebrates, protects and helps, and that it will finally also 
free us after the body in such a way that our body, which 
is sown in corruption, in shame and in weakness, will rise 
again in incorruption, in glory and power. Therefore it is 
an unspeakable freedom that we are free from God's 
wrath in eternity, which is greater than heaven and earth 
and all creatures. 

(7) From this freedom follows another, in which 
through Christ we are made safe and free from the law, 
from sin, from death, from the power of the devil, from 
hell 2c. For just as the wrath of God cannot terrify us, 
since Christ has freed us from it, so the law, sin 2c. 
cannot accuse and condemn us; and although the law 
accuses us, and sin terrifies us, yet they cannot drive us 
into despair, because faith, which overcomes the world, 
immediately says, "These things are none of my 
business, for Christ has set me free. 


604 ait. kai. 11, 289-292. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 5, 1. W. VIII, 2889-2591. 


605 





freed from the same. Thus, even death, the most 
powerful and terrifying [tyrant] in the whole world, lies 
down as a conquered one in the conscience, through 
this freedom of the spirit. 

Therefore, this majesty of Christian freedom must be 
carefully considered and pondered. It is indeed easy to 
speak these words: Freedom from God's wrath, from the 
law, from sin, from death 2c., but to feel the greatness 
of this freedom and in the struggle, in the highest 
distress of the conscience, to put it into action so that 
one may appropriate the fruit of it, that is more difficult 
than one can say. 

Therefore the heart must be accustomed, when it 
feels the accusation of the law, the terrors of sin, the 
horror of death, the wrath of God, to put these sad 
images out of its sight and to put in their place the 
freedom of Christ, the forgiveness of _ sins, 
righteousness, life and the eternal mercy of God, and 
although the feeling of the opposite is present in a strong 
measure, it should nevertheless certainly think that this 
will not last long, as the prophet [Isa. 54, 7. 8.] says: "I 
have left thee a little while, but with everlasting mercy 
will | have mercy upon thee." But this is very difficult to 
do. Therefore this freedom, which Christ has brought 
about for us, cannot be believed as soon as it can be 
called by name. If it could be grasped with certain, firm 
faith, no rage or terror of the world, of the law, of sin, of 
death, of the devil 2c. could be so great that it should not 
be swallowed up by it at once, like a little spark from the 
sea. Certainly this freedom of Christ takes away the 
entire burden of all evil and lifts it out: the law, sin, death, 
the wrath of God and finally even the serpent with its 
head, and puts in its place righteousness, peace, life 2c. 
But blessed is he who understands and believes this. 

(10) Let us therefore learn to esteem this freedom of 
ours, which was not purchased for us by an emperor, 
nor by a prophet, nor by an archangel, nor by an angel 
from heaven, but by Christ, the Son of God, through 
whom all things in heaven and on earth were created, 
by his death, not that he might free us from a bodily and 
temporal bondage. 


We are not freed from the spiritual and eternal dominion 
of the cruelest and most insurmountable tyrants, the law, 
sin, death, the devil, 2c., and thus reconciled to God the 
Father. Now that these enemies have been completely 
defeated and we have been reconciled to God through 
the death of His Son, it is certain that we are righteous 
before God, and all our deeds are pleasing to Him, and 
even though there is still some sin left in us, it is not 
imputed to us, but is forgiven for the sake of Christ. 


(11) Paul uses weighty (significantibus) and 
emphatic words here, which must be carefully 
considered. "Stand," he says, "in liberty, that Christ may 
set us free." So this liberty is not given to us for the sake 
of the law or our righteousness, but freely, for the sake 
of Christ, which Paul here testifies and expatiates upon 
throughout the epistle. Christ also [pronounces it] John 
8:36: "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be justly 
free." He alone is placed between us and all evil that 
oppresses us; he overcomes it and removes it so that it 
can no longer oppress and condemn us. For sin and 
death he gives us righteousness and eternal life, and 
thus he changes the bondage and terrors of the law into 
freedom of conscience and consolation of the gospel, 
which says [Matt. 9:2], "Be of good cheer, my son, thy 
sins be forgiven thee." Therefore, whoever believes in 
Christ has this freedom. 

(12) Reason does not see what a great thing this is, 
which, when seen in the spirit, is exceedingly great and 
inestimable. For no one can grasp with his mind how 
great a gift this is, that instead of the law, sin, death, and 
the wrath of God, one has forgiveness of sins, 
righteousness, and eternal life, and an ever-gracious 
and favorable God. The papists and all hypocrites,’ who 
pursue the righteousness of the law or their own 
righteousness, also boast that they have forgiveness of 
sins, righteousness, a gracious God 2c.; they also boast 
of freedom and promise it to others, but this is all without 


reason (€gena) and uncertain. For 


606 Dri. "Li. II, 292-294. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2591-2596. 


In fact, they are servants of destruction [2 Petr. 2, 19], to 
whom all their futile trust vanishes in a moment during 
the challenge, because they base themselves on works 
and human satisfactions, not on God's word nor on 
Christ, and therefore it is impossible that they should 
know what freedom from sins is 2c. 

(13) On the other hand, our freedom is based on 
Christ, who is the eternal High Priest, sitting at the right 
hand of God and representing us. Therefore, the 
forgiveness of sins, righteousness, life and freedom that 
we have through Him are certain, unchangeable (rata) 
and eternal, if only we believe it. Therefore, if we cling 
firmly to Christ in faith and stand firm in the freedom with 
which he has set us free, we will have these 
unspeakable goods. But if we will be secure and sleepy, 
we will lose them. 

14 Not for nothing does Paul urge us to watch and 
stand firm, because he knows that the devil is working 
unceasingly to snatch from us that freedom which was 
so dear to Christ, so that he might again bring us under 
the yoke of bondage through his servants, as follows: 


And do not let yourselves be caught 
again in the servile yoke. 


(15) Paul spoke very strongly (gravissime) about 
grace and Christian liberty, exhorting the Galatians with 
the most glorious words that they should persevere in it, 
for it is easily lost. Therefore he urges them to stand firm, 
lest through their drowsiness or assurance they fall away 
again from grace and faith to law and works. But 
because reason, which prefers the righteousness of the 
law to the righteousness of faith, thinks that there is no 
danger in it, Paul indignantly attacks the law of God, 
calling it a "yoke" and a "servile yoke" with great 
contempt and disparagement. So also Peter says Apost. 
15, 10: "What do you tempt GOD with putting on a yoke" 
2c. And so in everything he sets the opposite [of what 
reason teaches]. For the false 


607 


The apostles diminished the promise and exalted the law 
and its works in this way: If you want to be free from sin 
and death and to attain righteousness and life, do the 
law, be circumcised, keep days, months, times and 
years, bring sacrifices 2c., then this obedience to the law 
will make you righteous and blessed. Paul says just the 
opposite. Those, he says, who teach the law in this way 
do not free the consciences, but entangle them, and put 
them under a yoke, and that under a bondage yoke. 

(16) Thus he speaks of the law in an exceedingly 
contemptuous and disgraceful manner, calling it a rope 
of the hardest servitude and of the servile yoke. And he 
does not do this in vain. For the harmful delusion that the 
law makes righteous clings very tenaciously to reason, 
and the whole human race is so strongly taken up by it 
and entangled in it that it is very difficult to get rid of it. 
And Paul, as can be seen, compares those who seek to 
attain righteousness through the law to oxen forced 
under the yoke, so that he denies the law its honor, as if 
it made them righteous. For as the oxen, which with 
great difficulty draw the yoke, have nothing of it but their 
fodder, and when they are no longer able to draw the 
yoke, are slain, so those who seek to attain 
righteousness by the law are captives, and are pressed 
by the yoke of bondage, that is, the law. And when they 
have labored long with great toil and sorrow in the works 
of the law, they finally bear this reward, that they are 
wretched servants forever. Whose servants? Of sin, of 
death, of the wrath of God, of the devil 2c. Therefore 
there is no greater and harder bondage than that of the 
law. Not in vain, therefore, does Paul call it a bondage 
yoke, because the law, as we have often said above 
[Cap. 3, § 447 ff.], only indicates sin and makes it 
greater, accuses, terrifies, condemns, inflicts wrath, and 
finally, which is the most miserable and hardest 
bondage, drives consciences to despair. Rom. 3, 20. 4, 
15. 7, 7. 

17 So Paul uses very heated words. 


608 Lri. 6ai. II, 294-296. Explanation of Galatians 5, 1. 2. W. VIII, 2596-2599. 609

610 Lr. 6ai. Il, 296-298. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2599-2693. 


Those who teach that, in order to attain salvation, 
something is necessary apart from faith in Christ, or who 
establish some kind of work or worship, or who keep 
some kind of rule, statute, or ceremony, thinking that 
they will thereby attain forgiveness of _ sins, 
righteousness, and eternal life: they hear here that the 
Holy Spirit, through the apostle, passes judgment 
against them, that Christ is of no use to them at all. And 
Paul, which is very surprising, dares to pass this 
judgment against the law and the circumcision that God 
has ordained, what should he not dare to do against the 
chaff of human statutes? 

Therefore, this passage is a terrible thunderclap 
against the whole realm of the pope. For all priests, monks, 
hermits 2c. (1 am speaking of the best) have not trusted 
Christ, whom they have made an angry judge, accuser, and 
condemner with the greatest injustice and blasphemy, but 
their own works, righteousness, vows, and merits, and 
therefore here they hear their judgment that Christ is of no 
use to them. For if by their own righteousness and severity 
of life they can put away sins and merit forgiveness of sins 
and eternal life, of what use is it to them that Christ was 
born, suffered, shed his blood, rose again, overcame sin, 
death and the devil, since they themselves can overcome 
these monsters by their own efforts? But it cannot be said 
how great a disgrace (indignitas) it is to make Christ 
useless, and that is why Paul, out of great indignation of 
mind and movement of spirit, speaks these words: "If you 
allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ is of no use to 
you," that is, of all his benefits no benefit at all will flow over 
to you, but for you he has done it all in vain. 

23 From this it is sufficiently evident that there is nothing 
more harmful in the whole world than the teachings of 
human statutes and works, because they all at once pervert 
and nullify the truth of the gospel, faith, the right worship of 
God, Christ Himself, in whom God has decided everything, 
Col. 2:3: "In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom. 


611 


The whole fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily. 
Therefore, whoever establishes or deals with works 
doctrines suppresses the gospel, makes the death and 
victory of Christ useless, obscures His sacraments and 
abrogates their true use, and is a denier, enemy and 
blasphemer of God with all His fine promises and 
benefits. 

24. Whom Paul calls the law of God a servile yoke, 
that those who claim that keeping circumcision is 
necessary for salvation make Christ useless, is not 
deterred from the law and circumcision, but rather from 
human statutes, from trusting in one's own righteousness 
and works, and is not provoked to long for freedom in 
Christ, is harder than stone and iron. 

(25) Now this is a very clear judgment: Christ is 
useless, that is, was born in vain, suffered in vain, 2c. for 
him who allows himself to be circumcised, that is, who 
puts his trust in circumcision. For Paul, as | said above, 
is not speaking of the work in and of itself, which does no 
harm if one does not trust in it and does not cherish the 
delusion that one will be justified by it, but of the custom 
of the work, that is, of the trust placed in the work and of 
the righteousness that is attached to it. For we must 
understand Paul's words according to the main subject 


with which he is dealing (secundum materiam 


subjectam), or according to the proof which he gives, 
which consists in this, that men are not justified by the 
law, works, circumcision 2c. He does not say that works 
in themselves are nothing, but that reliance on works and 
righteousness from works, for this makes Christ useless. 
Therefore, whoever receives circumcision thinking that it 
is necessary for justification, Christ is of no use to him. 

(26) We should be mindful of this in the trials that 
each one of us must endure when the devil accuses and 
terrifies our conscience in order to bring it to despair. For 
he is the father of lies and an enemy of Christian 
freedom. That is why he plagues us with false terror 
every moment, in order to make the conscience reject 
this 


612 Arr Oai. n, 2S8-301. Explanation of Galatians 5, 2. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 5, 2. 3. W. VIII, 2603-2606. | 





| will let go of my freedom, | will always be in fear, and | 
will feel guilt and terror. When, | say, the great dragon, 
the old serpent, the devil (who deceives the whole world 
and accuses our brothers day and night before God's 
face, Revelation 12:10) comes and reproaches you that 
you have not only done no good, but have also 
transgressed the law of God, then say: "You make it 
difficult for me by reminding me of my past sins, then 
you reproach me that | have done no good. | do not 
accept this. For if | either trust in the good works | have 
done or despair because of the works | have not done, 
Christ would be of no use to me on either side. So if you 
hold my sins against me or my good works, | will not turn 
to them, but put both out of sight and base myself solely 
on the freedom with which Christ has set me free. | know 
that he is useful to me, and therefore | do not want to 
make him useless to me, which would happen if | either 
failed to obtain grace and eternal life because of my 
good works, or despaired of my salvation because of my 
sins. 

(27) Therefore we must learn diligently to distinguish 
Christ as far as possible from all works, whether good or 
evil, from all laws, whether divine or human, from all 
sorrowful consciences, for that is not where Christ 
belongs. He does belong to the sorrowful consciences, 
but not to frighten them more, but to raise and comfort 
the already troubled consciences. Therefore, if Christ 
appears under the guise of an angry judge or a lawgiver 
who demands an account of how we have spent our 
lives, we should know for certain that it is not Christ but 
the raging devil. For the Scriptures do not describe 
Christ in such a way that he is our reconciler, advocate 
and comforter. He is and always will be such and cannot 
become unlike himself. 

(28) Therefore, if the devil accepts Christ's 
permission and disputes with us in this way, "You should 
have done this, as you were reminded by my word, and 
you failed to do it; you should have refrained from doing 
that. 





and have done it: therefore thou shalt know that | will 
punish thee 2c., this shall not move us, but we should 
immediately remember: Christ does not speak in such a 
way to the despairing consciences; to those who are 
distressed [about their sins] he does not add new 
tribulation, [for] "he breaketh not the bruised reed, 
neither quencheth he the smoldering wick" [Matth. 12, 
20.]. He speaks harshly to the hard, but he beckons the 
frightened to him in a most loving way, saying [Matth. 11, 
28]: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened" 
2c. [Matth. 9, 13.:] "| have come, not to call the righteous 
to repentance, but sinners." [Matth. 9, 2.:] "Be of good 
cheer, my son, your sins are forgiven you." [Jn. 16, 33. 
"Be of good cheer, | have overcome the odds." [Luc. 19, 
10.:] "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that 
which was lost" 2c. 

Therefore we must take care that we do not, 
deceived by the marvelous art and the innumerable 
wiles of Satan, take the accuser and destroyer for a 
comforter and savior, and so, under the guise of the 
false Christ, that is, of the devil, lose the true Christ, and 
we ourselves make him useless. Let this be said of the 
temptations that each one has for his own person, as we 
should have ourselves in them. 


V. 3. Again, I testify to everyone who is 
circumcised that he still owes to do the whole law. 


(30) The first harm is certainly immense, that Paul 
says Christ is of no use to those who are circumcised. 
This following harm is not less, that he says that those 
who are circumcised are guilty of keeping the whole law. 
These words he speaks with such earnestness that he 
also affirms them with an oath. "I testify" 2c., that is, | 
swear by all that is holy. 

These words can be interpreted in two ways, 
negatively and affirmatively. In a negative way like this: 
| testify to every man who is circumcised that he is guilty 
of having the whole law, that is, that he has nothing of 
the law; even by the work of circumcision he is not 


614 Lri. 6ai. II, 301-S03. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2606-2609. 


615 





circumcised, even though he fulfills the law, he does not 
fulfill it, but transgresses it. And this seems to me to be 
the simple and correct opinion of Paul at this point. For 
afterwards, Cap. 6, 13. he interprets himself, saying, 
"For even they themselves, who are circumcised, do not 
keep the law"; and so he said above, Cap. 3, 10. said, 
"They that deal with the works of the law are under the 
curse." As if he meant to say: If ye also be circumcised, 
ye are not therefore righteous and free from the law, but 
by that very fact ye have become only the more debtors 
and servants of the law. Precisely by striving to do 
enough for the law and to become free from it, you bring 
yourselves more and more under its yoke, so that it has 
all the more right to accuse and condemn you. This 
means going forward like a crab and washing dirt with 
dirt. 

(32) And this, which | take from the words of Paul and 
speak, | have also learned from experience in the 
monastery, in myself and in others. | have seen many 
who, with the greatest zeal and in the best opinion 


(conscientia), did their utmost to satisfy their 
consciences; they wore hard shirts, fasted, prayed, 
tortured and afflicted their bodies with all kinds of pains, 
with which they would have had to destroy them in the 
end, even if they had been iron, and yet the more they 
struggled, the more despondent they became. And 
especially when the hour of death came, they were so 
full of terror that | have seen several murderers, who 
were sentenced to the death penalty, die much more 
confidently than these people, who had lived extremely 
holy lives. 1) 

Therefore, it is absolutely true that those who do the 
law do not do it. For the more men strive to do the law 
enough, the more they transgress it. The same is true of 
human statutes. The more a man strives to quiet his 
conscience by them, the more he makes it restless. 
When | was a monk, | took the greatest care to live 
according to the prescribed rule; | used to do so, 
however, only after | had first seriously repented, 


1) Cf. Tischreden, Cap. 30, s 32. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. 
XXII, 907. 





| often repeated my confession, 2) and_ faithfully 
performed the penance imposed on me. And yet my 
conscience could never become certain, but always 
doubted and said: You did not do that right, you were not 
penitent enough, you left that out in confession 2c. The 
longer | sought to heal my uncertain, weak and shattered 
conscience with human statutes, the more uncertain, 
weak and anxious | made it. And in this way, the more | 
sought to keep human statutes, the more | transgressed 
them, and as | pursued the righteousness of my order, | 
could never grasp it, because it is impossible, as Paul 
says, for the conscience to be pacified by works of the 
law, much less by human statutes without the promise 
and gospel of Christ. 

(34) Therefore, those who want to be justified and 
alive by the law are further from righteousness and life 
than tax collectors, sinners and harlots. For these cannot 
base their confidence on their works, since these are 
such that they cannot have confidence that they will 
obtain grace and forgiveness of sins because of them. 
For if righteousness and works done under the law do 
not justify, much less can sins committed against the law 
justify. In this respect, therefore, they are better off than 
the saints of works, because they do not have confidence 
in their own works, which, if it does not entirely remove 
faith in Christ, nevertheless hinders it very much 


(maxime). 
(35) On the other hand, saints of works, who 
outwardly abstain from sins and appear to live 


blamelessly and conscientiously (religiously), cannot 
avoid the delusion that they trust in themselves and their 
own righteousness, in which faith in Christ cannot stand, 
and therefore they are worse off than tax collectors and 
harlots, who do not hold their good works up to God in 
his wrath, so that he may give them the benefit of the 
doubt. 


2) Namely, to make up for what had been forgotten. Cf. 
Tischreden, Cap. 18, § I., Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXII, 556. 


616 Li-I. Oru. II, 303-305. Explanation of Galatians 5, 3, W. VIII, 2609-2612. 617 


give them eternal life in return (as the works saints do), 
because they have no good works, but desire to have 
their sins forgiven for Christ's sake 2c. 

(36) Therefore, he who does the law, thinking that he 
will be justified by it, is still guilty of doing the whole law, 
that is, he has not yet fulfilled even one letter of the law. 
Nor was the law given for the purpose of making 
righteous, but for the purpose of denouncing, deterring, 
accusing, and condemning sin. 

Therefore, the more one tries to counsel the 
conscience through laws and works, the more uncertain 
and restless he makes it. Ask all monks who earnestly 
strive to attain peace of conscience through their 
statutes whether they can be sure that their status is 
pleasing to God and that they are in God's grace for it? 
If they want to confess the truth, they will answer: | live 
blamelessly and keep my order with the greatest care, 
but | cannot say with certainty whether this obedience of 
mine pleases God or not. 

38 In the biographies of the Fathers, one reads of 
Arsenius (whom | have also considered above): 
Although he had lived for a long time in the greatest 
holiness and abstinence, he nevertheless began, when 
he felt that death was no longer very far from him, to be 
very afraid and to become sad. When he was asked why 
he feared death, since he had lived his whole life in 
holiness and had served God without ceasing, he 
answered that he had lived blamelessly according to the 
judgment of men, but that God's judgment was quite 
different from that of men. This man, with the holiness 
and austerity of a fine life, has attained nothing other 
than that he feared and was terrified of death. When he 
was preserved, he had to abandon all his righteousness 
and base himself solely on God's mercy and say: | 
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Lord, who 
suffered, was crucified and died for my sins 2c. 

(39) The other understanding [see §31], the 
affirmative one, is that he who is circumcised is guilty of 
keeping the whole law. For he who accepts Moses in 
one piece, 





He must also accept it in all respects. He who considers 
one part of the law necessary [to salvation] must also 
consider all the other parts of it, and it does not help to 
say that circumcision is necessary, but not the other 
laws of Moses in the same way. By the same reason that 
urges you to circumcision, you are also urged to the 
whole law. 

(40) But to keep the whole law is nothing else than to 
indicate by the deed that Christ has not yet come. If this 
is true, then all Jewish ceremonies and laws of food, 
places and times must be kept, and Christ must still be 
expected, who, after the kingdom and priesthood of the 
Jews has been taken away, will establish a new 
kingdom on the whole earth. But all Scripture testifies, 
and fact proves it, that Christ has already come, that he 
has redeemed the human race by his death, has 
abolished the law, and has fulfilled all that all the 
prophets foretold about him. So he abolished the law 
and gave grace and truth. Therefore, neither the law nor 
its works justify, but faith in Christ, who has already 
come. 

(41) Nowadays, some people have tried to bind us to 
some of the laws of Moses in the same way as the false 
apostles did at that time, which they liked. We must not 
suffer this at all. For if we allowed Moses to rule over us 
in any way, we would have to bear his whole rule. 
Therefore we do not tolerate being burdened with any of 
the laws of Moses. We allow that we must read and 
listen to Moses as a preacher and witness of Christ, and 
that we may learn from him examples of the best laws 
and customs, but in no other way do we allow him to rule 
over the conscience. Then he shall be dead and buried 
fine, and no one shall know where his grave is. 

42. The first mind, namely, the negating one, seems 
to me to be most in accordance with the opinion of the 


Holy Spirit (spiritualior) and most fitting. But either of 


these two interpretations is good and condemns the 
righteousness of the law; first, it lacks so much 


618 Li. kai. 1, 3v5-307. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vu, 2612-2615. 


Secondly, whoever wants to do a part of the law is guilty 
of doing the whole law; in short, Christ is of no use to 
those who want to be justified by the law. From this it 
follows that Paul indicates by all this that the law is a 
denial of Christ. But it is a strange thing that Paul dares 
to claim that the Law of Moses, which was given by God 
to the people of Israel, is a denial of Christ. Why then did 
God give the law? Before the coming of Christ, when it 
was still expected that he would come into the flesh, it 
was necessary. For the law is our disciplinarian for 
Christ. But now that Christ has appeared, we, if we 
believe in him, are no longer under the disciplinarian. 
We have spoken about this in sufficient detail at the end 
of the third chapter. Whoever therefore teaches that the 
law is necessary for righteousness, teaches the denial 
of Christ and all his benefits, makes God a liar, and even 
makes the law itself a liar. For the law is a witness of the 
promises of Christ and has proclaimed beforehand that 
Christ will be a king, not of the law, but of grace. 


V. 4. Ye have lost Christ, who would be justified 
by the law, and have fallen away from grace. 


(43) Here Paul explains himself that he is not 
speaking of the law or the work of circumcision as such, 
but of the confidence and delusion that justification is 
obtained through it, as if to say: | do not condemn 
circumcision or the law par excellence. For | may eat, 
drink, live with the Jews under the law, | may circumcise 
Timothy 2c. But to want to be justified by the law, as if 
Christ had not yet come, or, since he is already present, 
could not alone justify, that | condemn, for that is to lose 


Christ. Therefore he says, "Ye are stripped" (evacuati 
estis), that is, ye are pharaohs, 1) that is, free from 
Christ, Chri- 


1) Luther derives the name Pharaoh from denude. Cf. Walch, old 
edition, Vol. Ill, 1042, s 70. 


619 


stus has ceased to be and to work in you. You no longer 
have anything of the knowledge, the spirit, the mind, the 
favor, the freedom, the life, the action of Christ, but are 
completely separated from him, so that he no longer has 
anything to do with you, nor you with him. 

(44) Let this be well observed and_ firmly 
remembered, that Paul says that to be justified by the 
law is nothing else than to be separated from Christ, and 
that he becomes completely useless to us. What can be 
said against the law that is more powerful? What can be 
said against this thunderbolt? 2) Therefore it is 
impossible for Christ and the law to dwell in the heart at 
the same time; for either the law or Christ must depart. 

45 But if you think that Christ and trust in the law can 
dwell together in your heart, then you must surely know 
that it is not Christ but the devil who dwells in your heart, 
accusing and terrifying you under the form of Christ, and 
requiring the law and the works of the law for 
righteousness. But the right Christ, as | also said shortly 
before, does not confront you about your sins, nor does 
he make you trust in your good works. And the right 
knowledge of Christ, or faith, does not dispute whether 
you have done good works for righteousness or evil 
works for condemnation, but simply holds that if you 
have done good works, you will not be justified; if you 
have done evil works, you will not be condemned. 

(46) | do not take away the honor of good works, nor 
do | praise evil works, but | say that in the matter of 
justification | must see to it that | keep Christ, lest he 
become useless to me when | seek to be justified by the 
law. For Christ alone justifies me against my evil works, 
and without my good works. If | thus think of Christ, | 
take hold of the right Christ. But if | think that he will put 
away from me the law and works, then | will not be 
justified. 


2) The following up to the end of § 45 has been used by Aurifaber 
(in the translation of Menius) for § 124 of the 7th chapter of the Table 
Talks. In our edition of the Table Talks, this section is omitted.

621 





If | require him for righteousness, he has become 
useless to me and | have lost him. 

These sayings and threats against the righteousness 
of the law and one's own righteousness are terrifying. 


Then there are also certain fundamentals (principia) that 
support the article of justification. So this is the final 
conclusion: Either you must lose Christ or the 
righteousness of the law. If you keep Christ, you are 
righteous before God. If you keep the law, Christ is of no 
use to you and you are guilty of keeping the whole law 
and have your verdict [Gal. 3:10]: "Cursed be everyone 
who does not abide" 2c. 

(48) In the same way we say of human statutes, as 
we have already said of the law: Either the pope and his 
clergy abandon all that he has trusted in until now, or 
Christ will be of no use to him. 

From this it is easy to judge how harmful and 
pernicious the papist doctrine has been. For it has led 
us far away from Christ and made him completely 
useless to us. For God complains in the prophet 
Jeremiah, Cap. 23, 26. f., that the prophets prophesy 
falsely and prophesy deceitfully of their hearts, and this 
because they want His people to forget His name 2c. 
Just as the false prophets left the right interpretation of 
the law and the doctrine of the seed of Abraham, the 
giver of blessings to all nations, standing by and 
preaching their dreams, so that the people would forget 
their God, so the papists have obscured and suppressed 
the gospel of Christ, so that there is no longer any use 
for it, and have insisted only on the doctrine of works, by 
which they have led the whole race as far as possible 
from Christ. Whoever seriously considers this must be 
appalled by it. 


And have fallen from grace. 


(50) That is, you are no longer in the kingdom of 
grace. For just as he who falls from a ship into the sea 
must drown, no matter from what part of the ship he has 
fallen, so he who falls from grace must also perish. 
Therefore, whoever wants to be justified by the law, 
suffers ship. 





and plunges into the certain danger that he will have to 
suffer eternal death. But what greater nonsense and 
godlessness can there be than to throw away the grace 
and favor of God and want to keep the Law of Moses? If 
you keep it, you will inevitably incur wrath and all evil. 

(51) But if those who want to be justified by the moral 
law fall from grace, dear one, where will the works saints 
fall who want to be justified by statutes and by their 
vows? Into the deepest abyss of hell. [Rather, they say, 
they will be lifted up to heaven. For thus they have 
taught: All those who walk in the rule of Franciscus 2c., 
upon them be peace and mercy of God; likewise: He 
who keeps chastity, obedience 2c. will have eternal life. 
But do not turn away from this vain and ungodly talk, and 
pay attention to what Paul teaches here, and also to 
what Christ says [John 3:36]: "He who believes in the 
Son of God has eternal life. He that believeth not the Son 
shall not see life, but the wrath of GOD abideth on him." 
Likewise [v. 18.], "He that believeth not is judged 
already." 

As the doctrine of the papists, to mention this in 
passing, which has to do with human statutes, works, 
vows, merits, etc., was the most widespread in the world, 
it was also thought to be the best and most certain. 
Through it the devil also established his kingdom 
through the pope and fortified it in the most powerful 
way. Therefore, it is no wonder that today, through the 
power of the Word of God, we challenge it and scatter it 
like chaff before the wind, that Satan rages so horribly, 
fills everything with unrest and agitation, and arouses the 
whole world against us. Now someone might say: It 
would have been better to keep silent, then none of 
these great evils would have occurred. We must esteem 
the favor of God, whose glory we preach, higher than the 
rage of the world that persecutes us. For what is the 
pope and

622 Lri. Okli. II, 316-312. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2618-2621. 


623 





the whole world against God, whom we must certainly 
esteem and prefer to all creatures? Then the wicked 
exaggerate the riots and uproars that Satan arouses in 
order to suppress or at least desecrate our teachings. 
We, on the other hand, praise the immeasurable benefit 
and fruit of this teaching, which we esteem far higher 
than all the pieties, sects and uproars. We are indeed 
small and weak and carry the heavenly treasure in 
earthen vessels. But however weak the vessels may be, 
the treasure is infinite and incomprehensible. 

These words: "You have fallen from grace" must not 
be looked upon coldly and sleepily, for they are very 
emphatic. Whoever falls from grace loses reconciliation, 
forgiveness of sins, righteousness, freedom, life, which 
Christ earned for us through his death and resurrection, 
and again, instead of these goods, he receives God's 
wrath and judgment, sin, death, bondage to the devil, 
and eternal damnation. And this passage powerfully 
fortifies and strengthens our doctrine of faith or the 
article of justification, and wonderfully comforts us 
against the ravings of the papists, who persecute and 
condemn us as if we were heretics for teaching this 
article. This saying should reasonably frighten all 
enemies of faith and grace, that is, all those who deal in 
works, to stop persecuting and blaspheming the word of 
grace, life and eternal blessedness. But they are so 
hardened and obdurate that they do not see with their 
eyes, and even though they hear with their ears that the 
apostle passes this terrible sentence against them, they 
still do not hear. Therefore let us let them go, for they 
are blind men and leaders of the blind. 


V. 5. But we wait in the Spirit through the faith of 
righteousness, which must be hoped for. 

54 Paul concludes here with a beautiful summa 
(epiphonemate), saying: You want to be justified by the 
law, circumcision and works. In this way we do not seek 


righteousness, lest Christ become useless to us, lest we 
become guilty of keeping the whole law, and lest we 


not fall from grace, but "we wait in the Spirit through the 
faith of righteousness that must be hoped for." 

(55) Each word must be carefully considered, for the 
words are very weighty. He did not merely mean to say, 
as he usually does, "We are justified by faith," or, "in the 
Spirit by faith," but he added: "We wait for the 
righteousness that must be hoped for," at the same time 
including hope, so that he summed up everything 
concerning the matter of faith. 

(56) Since he says, "We wait in the Spirit by faith," 
2c., note the contrast that is in the word "Spirit," as if he 
meant to say: We do not seek to be justified in the flesh, 
but deal with it that we may be justified in the Spirit, and 
that in the Spirit in such a way that it may not be a 
swarming spirit and a master grown out of itself, as the 
heretics boast of the Spirit, but our spirit is by faith. Of 
the spirit and faith has been abundantly said above. But 
here he does not say only: We are justified by the Spirit 
through faith, but adds: "We wait for the righteousness 
that must be hoped for," which is a new addition. 

(57) The word "hope", according to the Scriptures, 
can be taken in two ways: for the thing that is hoped for 
and for the heart that hopes. Of the thing hoped for, Col. 
1:5: "For the hope that is set before you in heaven," that 
is, for the thing hoped for; of the heart that hopes, Rom. 
8:24, 25: "But the hope that is seen is not hope; for how 
can we hope for that which is seen? But if we hope for 
that which we do not see, we wait for it through 
patience." 

(58) So also in this passage "hope" can be taken in 
a twofold way, and accordingly a twofold mind arises. 
The first is: We expect in the Spirit through faith the hope 
of our righteousness, that is, the hoped-for 
righteousness, which must certainly be revealed in its 
time. The other: We expect in the spirit by faith in hope 
and desire the righteousness, that is, we are righteous, 
and yet our righteousness is not yet revealed, 


624 i. kai. 1, 312-314. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 5, 5. W. Vill, 2621-2623. 


625 





but is still suspended in hope, Rom. 8:24: "We are 
blessed in hope." For as long as we live, sin clings to our 
flesh; the law remains in the flesh and in the members, 
which is contrary to the law in my mind, and takes us 


captive into the service of sin. Now when the affections 


(affectibus) of the flesh rage and we resist them in the 
spirit, there remains room for hope. We have indeed 
begun to be justified by faith, through which we have also 
received the firstfruits of the Spirit, and the slaying of the 
flesh has begun, but we are not yet perfectly justified. It 
still remains that we become perfectly righteous, and this 
we hope. So our righteousness is not yet in fact, but still 
in hope. 

(59) This is a very weighty and exceedingly sweet 
consolation, by which the sorrowful and troubled hearts, 
which feel their sins and are terrified by every fiery dart 
of the devil, can be wonderfully uplifted. For in this battle 
of conscience, as we know from experience, the feeling 
of sin, of the wrath of God, of death, of hell and of all 
terrors prevails tremendously. Then one must say to the 
one who is challenged: Dear brother, you want to have a 
righteousness that is felt, that is, you wish to feel 
righteousness as you feel sin; this will not happen. But 
your righteousness must reach beyond the feeling of sin, 
and you must hope that you will be righteous before God, 
that is, your righteousness is not visible, is not tangible, 
but it is hoped that it will be revealed in its time. 
Therefore, you must not judge according to the feeling of 
sin, which frightens and worries you, but according to the 
promise and the teaching of faith, through which Christ is 
promised to you, who is your perfect and eternal 
righteousness. 


(60) Thus, in my hopeful heart (affectu), in the midst 
of fear and the feeling of sin, my hope is stirred and raised 
up by faith, so that it can hope that | am righteous. Then 
hope, which is directed to the thing hoped for (pro re 
sperata), hopes that what it does not yet see will be 
accomplished and open in its time. 





beard. Both understanding is good, but the former, from 
the heart that hopes, brings richer comfort. For my 
righteousness is not yet perfect, nor can it be felt, yet | do 
not despair because of it, but faith shows me Christ in 
whom | trust. 

(61) When | have taken hold of Christ in faith, | fight 
with the fiery darts of the devil, and am strengthened by 
hope against the feeling of sin, holding fast that 
righteousness is prepared for me in heaven. So both are 
true, that | am justified here by the incipient 
righteousness, and in this hope am established against 
sin, and await the consummation of perfect 
righteousness in heaven. This is then rightly understood 
when it is brought into custom. 


What a difference there is between faith and 
hope. 


(62) Here the question arises, what is the difference 
between faith and hope? In this the sophists have 
labored much, but have not been able to indicate 
anything certain. For us, who are most diligent in dealing 
with the Scriptures, and who (without glory) treat them 
with a far higher spirit and understanding, it is difficult to 
find a [significant] difference. For faith and hope have 
such a close relationship with each other that they cannot 
be torn from each other. And yet there is some difference 
between them, which is to be derived from the work 


which they have to accomplish (ab officiis), from the 
opposites with which they have to contend (contrariis), 


and the goal toward which they are directed (finibus). 
1(63) First. Faith and hope are distinguished 
according to the source from which they proceed 


(subjecto); for faith is in the understanding (in intellectu), 
hope in the will. But in substance they cannot be 
separated, for they look at each other like the two 
cherubim of the mercy seat. 


1) The following five paragraphs are used by Aurifaber (this time 
not in the translation of Menius) for K 36 of the 13th chapter of the 
Tischreden. In our edition of the Table Talks, this section is omitted. 


626 Lri. "Li. Il, 314-316. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2623-2627. 


627 





Secondly, according to its work (officio), because 


faith prescribes, guides and teaches, and is notitia. 
Hope is an exhortation, for it provokes the heart to be 
strong and not to waver; to dare, to endure, to persevere 
in adversity, and in all this to expect things to get better. 

(65) Thirdly, according to the object [with which they 
are concerned]; for faith has for its object the truth, to 
which, as it teaches, one must certainly and firmly 
adhere, and is directed to the word that proclaims the 
thing (verbum rei) or to the promises of things. Hope has 
for its object the goodness [of God] (bonitatem) and is 
directed to the thing which the word indicates (rem 


verbi), that is, to the promised thing or to the things which 
one should hope for, of which faith has prescribed 


(dictavit) that one should receive them. 

Fourthly, according to their order, for faith is earlier 
than all tribulation; it is the beginning of life, Heb. 11:1, 
3; hope is the later; it arises out of tribulations. [Rom. 8, 
3.] 

Fifth, according to the contraries against which they 
are judged (a contrariis); for faith is a teacher and a judge 
who fights against error and heresies and judges the 
spirits and doctrines. Hope is a commander or leader in 
war, fighting against tribulation, cross, impatience, 
sadness, faintheartedness, despair, blasphemy, and 
expecting good in the midst of calamity. 

(68) Therefore, if I, informed by faith in God's word, 
take hold of Christ and believe in him with all the 
confidence of my heart (which, however, cannot happen 
without the will), | am justified by this knowledge. When 
| have thus become righteous by faith or by this 
knowledge, the devil, the father of lies, immediately 
comes and tries to extinguish faith by his cunning, that 
is, by lies, errors and heresies. Then, because he is a 
murderer, he also subordinates himself to suppress it by 
force. Then hope stands in battle and seizes the cause 
held out by faith, becomes stout-hearted and overcomes 
the devil, who looks at faith; when the 





is defeated, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit follow. So in 
the matter itself faith and hope can hardly be 
distinguished, and yet there is some difference between 
them. To make it easier to see this, | will explain the 
matter with a parable. 

In the world regiment, prudence and fortitude are 
different from each other, but these virtues are so 
closely connected that they cannot be easily separated. 


But fortitude is a steadfastness of heart that does not 
despair in adversity, but endures with confidence 


(fortiter) and expects a better turn (meliora). But if 
fortitude is not guided by prudence, it is temerity; and 
again, if fortitude is not added to prudence, prudence is 
void and useless. 1) Therefore, just as prudence without 
fortitude is useless in the worldly regime, so in theology 
faith without hope is nothing, for hope endures and 
perseveres in adversity and overcomes it. And again, 
just as bravery without prudence is foolhardiness, so 
hope without faith is presumption in spirit and a 
temptation of God. For it lacks the knowledge of the truth 
or of Christ that faith teaches; therefore, fortitude is blind 
and presumptuous. Therefore, a godly person must first 
of all have a right mind and an understanding that is 
instructed by faith, according to which in tribulation the 
heart is directed, so that in adversity it hopes for the best 
that faith has prescribed and taught. 

(70) Faith, then, is dialectic, which conceives 


(concipit) all that is to be believed; hope is rhetoric, 
which magnifies it, urges it, exhorts it, and encourages 
it to endure, so that faith may not succumb to temptation, 
but may retain the word and hold fast to it. Just as 
dialectics and rhetoric are two different arts, and yet so 
related to each other that they cannot be separated from 
each other (for an orator is not a speaker, but a teacher). 


1) The following in this paragraph and the beginning of the next 
paragraph are used by Aurifaber for § 36 of the 13th chapter of the 
Table Talks, in a very arbitrary revision. In our edition of the Table 
Talks, this section is omitted. 


628 Lri. Ssi. Il, 316-318. Explanation of Galatians 5, 5. W. VIII, 2627-2630. 


629 





Without dialectic, a dialectician cannot teach anything 
certain, and again, a dialectician without oratory makes 
no impression on the listeners; but if he combines both, 
he can teach and persuade), so faith and hope are 
different states of heart (affectus). For faith is something 
different from hope, and hope something different from 
faith, and yet they cannot be separated because of the 
great affinity they have to each other. Therefore, as 
dialectics and rhetoric serve each other, so do faith and 
hope. Therefore, there is such a difference between faith 
and hope in theology, as between reason and will in 
philosophy, between prudence and valor in the world 
regiment, between dialectics and rhetoric in a speech. 

(71) In short, faith is obtained by being taught 
(docendo), for then the heart is taught what is truth, but 
hope comes from exhortation, because through 
exhortation hope is awakened in tribulations, which 
strengthens the one who has already been justified by 
faith, so that he does not give way to evil, but only 
opposes it all the more boldly. But if the torch of faith did 
not shine on the will, hope could not be persuaded. So 
we have faith, by which we are instructed in heavenly 
wisdom, understand and recognize it, take hold of Christ 
and abide in his grace. If then we through faith believe 
in Christ and confess Him, enemies will immediately rise 
up against us, the world, the flesh, the devil, who will 
most bitterly hate and persecute us in body and spirit. 
Therefore we who have been justified in such faith wait 
in the spirit through the faith of our righteousness, which 
must be hoped for. But we wait in patience, because we 
see and feel the opposite. For the world with its prince, 
the devil, attacks us inwardly and outwardly with every 
kind of evil. In addition, we are also afflicted by sin, which 
makes us sad again and again. Nevertheless, we do not 
grow weary in all this, nor do we fall away, but bravely 
uphold the will through faith, which is the 





Will enlightens, instructs and governs us, and so we 
remain steadfast, overcoming all evil through Him who 
loved us, until our righteousness is revealed, which we 
believe and hope for. 

Thus by faith we have begun, by hope we endure, by 
revelation we shall attain the whole. In the meantime, as 
long as we live, we teach the word because we believe, 
and bring the knowledge of Christ to others as well. If we 
do this, we must suffer persecution (according to the 
words [Ps. 116, 10.]: "I believe, therefore | speak. But | 
am greatly afflicted"); when we suffer, we are powerfully 
lifted up by hope, as the Scriptures admonish us with the 
sweetest and most comforting promises that faith has 
taught. And so hope arises and grows in us, Rom. 15:4: 
"That we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures 
might have hope." Therefore Paul connects not without 
cause patience with hope in the tribulations, Rom. 5, 3. 
8, 25. and elsewhere, because by the same hope is 
awakened. 

(73) Faith, on the other hand, as we have reminded 
you above, is earlier than hope, for it is the beginning of 
life and begins before all tribulations. For it learns and 


grasps Christ without suffering (cruce); but the 
knowledge of Christ is immediately followed by the cross 
and the struggle. Then the heart must be exhorted to be 
strong in spirit (for hope is nothing other than theological 
courage, and faith, on the other hand, is theological 
prudence), which proves itself in suffering, according to 
the words (Rom. 15:4): "That we through patience and 
comfort of the Scriptures might have hope." "But now 
these three remain" [1 Cor. 13:13.); faith teaches the 
truth and defends it against error and heresies; hope 
endures and overcomes all evil, bodily and spiritual; 
love, as follows in the text, does all good. Thus it is with 


man inwardly and outwardly right (est integer), and he is 
perfect in this life until the righteousness is revealed, 
whose expectation is. This will be completely perfect 
(consummata) and eternal. 

Furthermore, this passage contains a very important 
lesson and great comfort. The teaching is, 


630 ari. kai. 11, 318-320. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vili, 2630-2633. 


631 





that we are not justified by works, outward customs, 
sacrifices, and the whole service of the Mosaic law, 
much less by human works and statutes, but by Christ 
alone. All that is in us without him, whether it be law, 
works and suffering, or understanding, will 2c., is flesh, 
not spirit. For all that the world has apart from Christ as 
the best and holiest is sin, error, and the flesh. Therefore 
circumcision, the keeping of the law, likewise works, 
spiritual states, the vows of the monks and all works 
saints are carnal. But we, says Paul, walk in a much 
higher nature than all this, in the spirit, because we have 
Christ through faith, and in tribulation we wait for the 
righteousness that is to be hoped for, which we already 
possess in faith. 

75 But the consolation is this: that in serious terror (in 
which the feeling of sin, sadness, despair 2c. is 
exceedingly great and strong, for this terror penetrates 
and takes hold of the innermost heart) you do not follow 
your feeling, for otherwise you would say: | feel very 
strongly the terrors of the law and the tyranny of sin, 
which not only fights against me, but takes me 
completely captive; | feel no comfort or righteousness, 
therefore | am a sinner, not righteous; but if | am a sinner, 
it follows that | am guilty of eternal death. Against this 
feeling strive and say: Although | feel that | am 
oppressed by sin and completely devoured, and the 
heart tells me that God is against me and is angry with 
me, this is not true in fact, only my feeling judges so. 
God's word, which | must follow in this terror, does not 
teach me to follow my feelings, but something 
completely different, namely [Ps. 34:19] that God is near 
to those who are brokenhearted and helps those who 
have a broken spirit; likewise [Ps. 51:19] that He does 
not despise a troubled and broken heart. Then Paul 
teaches here that those who are justified in spirit by faith 
do not yet feel the righteousness they hope for, but are 
still waiting for it. 

76. therefore, ifthe law accuses you and 








sin terrifies you, and you feel nothing but the wrath and 
judgment of God, you should not therefore despair, but 
take hold of the armor of God, the shield of faith, the 
helmet of hope, and the sword of the Spirit, and try to be 
a good and valiant warrior. By faith, take hold of Christ 
the Lord over the law and sin and all things that 
accompany them. If you believe in Him, you are 
righteous (this is what the Word of God, not reason or 
the feelings of your heart, tells you when you are 
challenged); then, in these struggles and terrors that 
keep returning and plaguing you, patiently await, through 
hope, the righteousness that you now have in faith, but 
only as a righteousness that has begun and is imperfect, 
until it is perfectly and eternally revealed in its time. 

(77) But | do not feel that | have righteousness, or at 
least | feel it very dimly. Thou shalt not feel, but believe 
that thou hast righteousness; and if thou believe not that 
thou art righteous, thou doest great dishonor and 
blasphemy unto Christ, who hath cleansed thee by the 
washing of water in the word, yea, who died upon the 
cross, having condemned and slain sin and death, that 
thou mightest obtain eternal righteousness and life by 
him. This you cannot deny (unless you want to be a 
publicly godless and blasphemous man and completely 
despise God, all divine promises, Christ and all his 
benefits), and therefore you cannot deny that you are 
righteous. 

Therefore, in great and terrible troubles, when the 
conscience feels nothing but sin, and judges that God is 
angry and Christ is turned away from us, we should learn 
not to consult the feelings of our heart, but to listen to the 
word of God, which says that God is not angry, but looks 
at the miserable, and the brokenhearted, and those who 
fear His word [Isa. 66, 2.]; that Christ does not turn away 
from the weary and the burdened, but restores them 2c. 
[For this passage clearly teaches that the law and works 
do not bring righteousness and comfort, 


632 


L7-I. Kai. Il, 320-322. Explanation of Galatians 5, 5. 6. w. vill, 2633-2638. 


633 





But this is done by the Spirit through faith in Christ, which 
awakens the hope that bears and overcomes evil, 
especially in terror and affliction. 

Very few people know how weak and small faith and 
hope are in the cross and struggle. For then they seem 
to be a smoldering wick, which the strong wind will 
extinguish immediately. But those who believe in hope 
in these struggles and terrors, since there is nothing to 
hope for, that is, who fight in faith in the promise of Christ 
against the feeling of sin and the wrath of God, 
experience afterwards that this very small spark of faith, 
as it seems to reason because it hardly feels it, 
becomes, as it were, a world fire (elementarem ignem [2 
Petr. 3:10, 12]), which fills the whole heaven and 
consumes all terrors and sins. 

(80) Truly godly people in the whole world have 
nothing dearer and more delicious than this doctrine, 
because, holding it, they know what the whole world 
does not know, namely, that sin and death and other 
misfortunes and evils, bodily and spiritual, serve the 
elect for the best. Likewise, they know that God is 
closest when He seems to be farthest away, that He is 
most merciful and a Savior when He seems to be most 
angry, to destroy and to ruin. They know then that they 
have eternal righteousness, which they wait for in hope 
as their very certain possession, which is apportioned to 
them in heaven, when they most feel the terrors of sin 
and death; that they are then lords over all things, when 
they are most destitute, according to the saying [2 Cor. 
6:10.], "As having nothing in themselves, and yet having 
all things." This is what Scripture calls receiving comfort 
through hope. But this art cannot be learned without 
frequent and great trials. 


V. 6 For in Christ neither circumcision nor 
foreskin counts for anything, but faith working 
through love. 

(81) The sophists apply this saying to their opinion, 


since they teach that we must be justified by love or by 
works. 





For they say that faith, even though it is infused by God 
(lam silent about faith obtained by one's own ability [de 


acquisita]), does not make one righteous if it has not 
received its proper form through love, because they call 
love the grace that makes man pleasing before God 


(gratiam gratum facientem), that justifies 


(justificantem) (to speak with our word, or rather that of 
Paul); then (they say) that love is obtained through our 
merit, which God must reward according to equity 


(nostro merito congrul) 2c. Yes, they also claim this, that 
the admitted faith can exist in the case of mortal sin. 
Thus they take justification completely away from faith 
and attribute it (in this way) to love alone, and this they 
want to have proven with this passage by St. Paul: 
"Faith that works through love", as if Paul wanted to say: 
Behold, faith does not make righteous, yes, it is nothing, 


if love is not added, which does the works (operatrix), 
which gives faith its right form. 

But all these are strange and horrible things, 
invented by spiritless men. For who could suffer it to be 
taught that faith, God's gift poured into the heart by the 
Holy Spirit, could exist in mortal sin? If they were talking 


about the acquisita or historical faith, and about the 
natural opinion drawn from history, they could be 
tolerated; indeed, they were right in talking about the 
historical faith. But since they teach about the infused 
faith in this way, they clearly confess that they do not 
understand anything at all about faith. 

Then they read this saying of Paul (as they say) 
through a colored glass and turn the text upside down 
and interpret it to their dreams. For Paul does not say: 
Faith that justifies by love; nor does he say: Faith that 
makes pleasant by love. They invent such a text and 
force it into this passage. Much less does he say: Love 
makes pleasant. Paul does not speak like this, but he 
says: "The faith that works through love. He does not 
say that the works of faith are done through love, 


is, 


634 Lri. Gai. Il, 322-324. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2636-2639. 635 





that man is justified by love. But who is such an 
unlearned grammarian that should not understand from 
the meaning of the words that to be justified is something 
different from doing works? For Paul's words are plain 
and clear: "Faith worketh by love." Therefore it is an 
obvious theft that those take away the true and right 
understanding of Paul and instead of "doing works" 
understand "being justified" and that works are 
righteousness, while they must also admit in moral 
philosophy that works are not righteousness, but that 
works come from righteousness. 

84. Furthermore, Paul does not make here a shapeless 


(informem) faith and as it were a desolate chaos, which 
neither is nor can do anything, but he ascribes just to 
faith the activity in works, and not to love, in that he does 


not invent a crude and shapeless nature (informem 
qualitatem) [of faith], but asserts that it is something 
active and effective (efficacem et operosam quidditatem) 
and, as it were, a being (substantiam) or (as they call it) 


a substantial being (formam substantialem). For he does 
not say, "Love is active," but, "Faith is active"; he does 
not say, "Love does works," but, "Faith does works." But 
he makes love, as it were, an instrument of faith, through 
which he performs his works. But everyone knows that 
an instrument does not derive its power, motion, and 
action from itself, but from the craftsman, worker, or 
wielder of it. For who would say: The axe gives the 
carpenter the power and movement to hew? The ship 
gives power and movement to the skipper to ship? Or to 
take the example of Isaiah [Isa. 10, 15.], who would say: 
The saw draws the carpenter, and the stick lifts up the 
hand? It is no different when these people say that love 


is the very essence of faith (formam fidei), or that it 
imparts power and activity to faith, or that it makes one 
righteous. Since Paul does not even concede works to 
love, how should he concede justification to it? 
Therefore it is certain that with great injustice, not only 
Paul, but also 


against faith and love itself has perverted this passage 
for love against faith. 

(85) But so it is with those who read carelessly, and 
who put forth their own thoughts in reading the sacred 
Scriptures, whereas they should be added as such 


people who know nothing (vacul) and should take their 
thoughts from the sacred Scriptures, then carefully 
ponder the words, compare the preceding with the 
following, and be anxious that they may attain the right 


(integrum) understanding of some passage, but not 
invent their dreams by mutilating the words or by tearing 
out the words. 

In this passage, Paul is not talking about what faith is 
or what it can do before God. He does not discuss (I say) 
justification. For this he has done in detail above in the 


whole epistle (per totum). But he concludes, as it were, 


with a short summary (epiphonemate) 1) of what a right 
Christian life is, by saying: "In Christ Jesus neither 
circumcision nor foreskin counts for anything, but the 
faith that is active through love," that is, the faith, not a 
fictitious nor a hypocritical one, but the true and living 
faith, that is, which practices good works through love 
and presses for the same. This is nothing else than 
saying: Whoever wants to be a Christian in truth or in 
Christ's kingdom must be a believer in truth. But he does 
not have a true faith, in whom the works of love do not 
follow faith. 

87. And so, on both sides, on the right and on the left, 
he excludes the hypocrites from the kingdom of Christ; 
on the left, the Jews and operarios, saying: In Christ 
neither circumcision, that is, no works, no worship, 
certainly no standing (vitae genus), but faith alone, 
without all reliance on works, is valid; on the right, the 
lazy and idle and idle, for they say, If faith without works 
justifies, let us do no works, but only believe and do what 
we will. Not so, ye ungodly, saith Paul. It is true, 


1) For Dreser's translation, cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. VII, 
2350, § 356; cf. § 54 of this chapter. 


636 Lri. Ski. Il, 324-326. Explanation of Galatians 5, 6. 7. W. VIII, 2639-2642. 


that faith alone justifies without works, but | am talking 
about true faith, which, after it has justified, does not 
snore idly, but is active through love. 

For this reason, as | have said, Paul depicts the 
entire Christian life in this passage, namely, that faith 
toward God is internal, and love or works toward one's 
neighbor is external, so that in this way a man is 


completely (absolutely) a Christian, internal through faith 
before God, who has no need of our works, external 
before men, to whom faith is of no use, but works or love 
are. Therefore, when one hears or knows of this essence 
of the Christian life, namely, that it is faith and love, as | 
have said, this does not yet say what faith is and what 


love is, for that is another trade (disputatio). For of faith, 


or the inward nature (natura), power, and usefulness of 
faith, he has dealt above, where he taught that it is 
righteousness, or rather justification before God. Here 
he connects it with love and works, that is, he speaks of 
its outward office. Here he says that it is the stimulus to 
good works or to love for one's neighbor and the cause 
of the same. 

Therefore, no one who has a right mind can 
understand this passage about trade, how to become 
righteous before God, since Paul is talking about the 
whole life of Christians, and it is quite a false art of 


conclusion, or rather a deception in composition and 


division (fallacia compositionis et divisionis), if one 
understands from a part what is said of the whole. For 
dialectics should not suffer from figurative speeches, 
synecdoches, and hyperboles, as rhetoric does, since it 
is the master of teaching, describing, dividing, 1) and 
summarizing as actually as is possible. For what kind of 
an art of deduction (dialectica) would this be: Man is soul 
and body and cannot be without soul and body; 
therefore the body has understanding, the soul alone 
has no understanding? It is exactly the same art of 
deduction: The Christian life is faith and love, or 


1) aividendl is missing in the Wittenberger. 


637 


faith, which is active through love; therefore, love 
justifies, not faith alone. But away with the human 
dreams. 

90 At the same time we can learn from this passage 
how terrible darkness is in these Egyptians, who not only 
despise faith but also love in Christianity and instead toil 
away with works of their own choosing, with plates, 
clothes, food and other innumerable masquerades 


(personatibus) and larvae, for the sake of which they 
want to be considered Christians. But here Paul stands 
extremely free and says with clear and distinct words: A 
Christian is made by faith which is active through love. 
He does not say: A Christian is made by the cap, the 
fasting, the clothing, the customs (rite), but by the true 
faith towards God, which loves the neighbor and does 
good to him, may he be servant or lord, king or bishop, 
man or woman, may he be clothed in purple or in rags, 
may he eat meat food or fish. Nothing, nothing of these 
things makes a Christian, but faith and love. Everything 
else is a lie and nothing but idolatry. 

And yet, nothing is more despised than faith and love 
among those who want to be the most Christian and in 


fact (plan) an even holier church than the holy church of 
God Himself. Again, they admire and praise their larvae 
and the fictitious nature of their self-chosen works, but 
underneath they cherish and cover their terrible 
idolatries, impieties, avarice, impurity, hatred, murder 
and the whole kingdom of hell and the devil. So powerful 
is the power of hypocrisy and superstition at all times 
from the beginning to the end of the world. 


V. 7. You were running fine. Who stopped you 
from disobeying the truth? 2c. 


This is clear. Paul assures that he teaches rightly now 
and teaches the same as he taught before, but that they 
would have run before, since they obeyed the truth, that 
is, they would have believed and lived rightly, but not 
now, after they were deceived by the false apostles. 
Furthermore, here he uses a new way of speaking 


(phrasi), since he calls the Christian life a race. 


638 Ari. Kai. II, 327-328. Interpretations on the epist 


e to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2642-2645. 639 





is called. For among the Hebrews, to run or walk is as 
much as to live and walk. Teachers and disciples walk 
when the former teach purely, but the latter receive the 
word with joy, and the fruits of the Spirit follow on both 
sides. This happened when Paul was present, as he 
testified above in the third and fourth chapters, and here: 
"You were doing well," that is, everything was going well 
with you: you were living in the best way, you were 
striving on the right path toward eternal life, which the 
Word promised you 2c. 

These words: "You walked well" contain a great 
consolation. The godly are tormented by this challenge, 
that their life seems to be lazy and more a kind of 
crawling than a running. But if they remain steadfast in 
the wholesome teaching and walk in the spirit, they 
should not be troubled that their activity seems to 
progress slowly, or rather to crawl. God judges much 
differently. For what seems to be slow to us, or hardly 
creeping, runs swiftly for him. Likewise, what in our eyes 
is sadness, suffering, death, with God is joy, laughter 
and bliss. Therefore Christ says: Blessed are you who 
mourn, weep 2c. for you shall be comforted, laugh 2c. 
[Matth. 5, 4. Luc. 6, 21.] To those who believe in the Son 
of God, everything is for the best, be it sadness or death. 
So they are real runners, and everything they do runs 
and has happy progress, because the spirit of Christ 
promotes it, who does not know slow success of his 
efforts. 


Who stopped you from disobeying the truth? 


94. in this course are stopped those who fall away 
from grace and faith to the law and works, as happened 
to the Galatians, who were persuaded and deceived by 
the false apostles, whom he covertly heckled with these 
words, "Who stopped you?" 2c. Similarly, he said above 
Cap. 3, 1. "Who hath bewitched you, that ye obey not 
the truth?" 

95 In passing, Paul also indicates here that people 
are so powerfully deceived by false doctrine that they 
believe lies and heresies. 





for the truth and spiritual doctrine, and again swear that 
the wholesome doctrine which they first loved is 
erroneous, and that their error is the wholesome 
doctrine, and that they will defend it with all their 
strength. 

96 Since the Galatians first walked in the best way, 
the false apostles led them to believe that before they 
had Paul as their teacher, they were in error and walked 
slowly. But later, when they were seduced by the false 
apostles and strayed far from the truth, they were so 
charmed by their false persuasion that they thought that 
all their things were going well and were in full swing. 
The same happens today to those who have deceived 
the spirits of the imagination 2c. That is why | often say 
that a fall in doctrine is not a human but a devilish fall, 
namely from the highest heaven into the deepest abyss 
of hell. For people who persist in their error lack so much 
that they should recognize their sin, that they even 
defend it as the highest righteousness. Therefore, it is 
impossible for them to obtain forgiveness. 


V. 8 Such persuasion is not from him who called 
you. 


97 This is an excellent comfort and teaching by which 
Paul teaches how to make false persuasion ineffective 
in those who are deceived by ungodly teachers. For the 
false apostles were great men who, as far as outward 
appearance was concerned, far surpassed Paul in 
doctrine and godliness. Since the Galatians, deceived 
by this appearance, heard them, they thought they heard 
Christ and therefore judged that their persuasion was 
from Christ. On the other hand, Paul indicates, though 
somewhat obscurely and with some _ reserve 


(verecunde), that this persuasion and teaching was not 
from Christ, who had called them to grace, but from the 
devil; and so he has removed this false persuasion from 
the hearts of many. So today we bring many who have 
been seduced by heretics out of their error again, when 
we show them that their opinions are fanatical and 
ungodly. 


640 Lri. Kai. Il, 32S-331. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 5, 8, W. VIII, 2646-2649. 


641 





This consolation also applies to all the afflicted who, 
in the midst of their temptation, have a false opinion of 
Christ. For the devil is astonishingly good at persuasion, 
since he knows how to make the smallest and almost 
ridiculous sin so great that the challenged person thinks 
it is the most horrible crime, worthy of eternal 
punishment. Here a heart that is challenged in such a 
way must be set straight, just as Paul set straight the 
Galatians, namely, that such a thought or such a 
persuasion is not from Christ, since it goes against the 
word of the Gospel, which does not portray Christ as an 
accuser, as a hard driver, but as a gentle, heartily 
humble, merciful Savior and Comforter. But if Satan 
turns this around (for he is a thousand-fold artist) and 
holds the word and example of Christ against you in this 
way: Christ is indeed meek, kind 2c., but against the 
righteous and the saints; against sinners he threatens 
wrath and destruction, Luc. 13, 5.; likewise he proclaims 
that unbelievers are already condemned, Joh. 3, 18.; 
further, Christ has done much good, endured much evil, 
and commands us to follow his example; but your life 
corresponds neither to the word nor to the example of 
Christ, because you are a sinner and an unbelieving 
man; in short, you have done nothing good 2c. 
Therefore, the sayings that portray Christ as a judge 2c. 
belong to you, but not the comforting ones of Christ the 
Savior 2c. This is the way in which the afflicted should 
comfort themselves: 

The Scriptures present Christ to us in two ways; first, 
as a gift. If | take hold of him in this way, | can lack 
nothing at all. For in Christ are hidden all the treasures 
of wisdom and knowledge (Col. 2, 3). As immeasurably 
great as he is, he was made for me by God for wisdom, 
righteousness, sanctification and redemption (1 Cor. 1, 
30). Therefore, even though | have committed many and 
great sins, if | believe in him, all will be swallowed up by 
his righteousness 2c. Secondly, Scripture also holds 
Christ up to us as an example to follow. But this Christ, 


who is to serve as an example (exemplarem Christum), 
| will not let him hold up to me, except on a happy day. 


| want to have a mirror in which | can look at how much 
| still lack, so that | do not become secure. But in the time 
of tribulation | will only hear and accept Christ, who is my 
gift, who died for my sins and shared his righteousness 
with me, and who has done and fulfilled for me what | 
lack in life. For "he is the end of the law, he who believes 
in him is righteous" (Rom. 10:4). 

It is useful to know this, not only so that we, each one 
of us, may have a reliable means in time of temptation 
by which to avoid that poison of despair by which Satan 
intends to poison us, but also so that we may resist the 
raging mobs of our time. For the Anabaptists have 
nothing in their whole teaching that has a more beautiful 
appearance than that they insist so much on the 
example of Christ and the cross, especially since the 
sayings are clear in which Christ praises the cross to his 
disciples. Therefore, we must learn how to resist this 
Satan who disguises himself in the form of an angel, 
namely in this way, that we make a distinction between 
Christ, who is sometimes preached as a gift, sometimes 
as an example. Each of these two sermons has its 
appropriate time; if it is not kept, the sermon to 
blessedness becomes a ruin. 

Therefore, to the people who are fearful and already 
terrified by the burden of their sins, Christ must be held 
up as a savior and a gift, not as an example and a 
lawgiver. But to the secure and hardened, the example 
of Christ and his harsh sayings and the terrifying 
examples of the wrath of God, as the flood, the 
destruction of Sodom 2c. should be held up, so that they 
will repent. 

Therefore let every Christian learn that when he is 
frightened and distressed, he can put out of his mind the 
false persuasion that has come to him about Christ, 
which Satan puts into him, and say, "Satan, what are you 
disputing with me about what | should do? Since | am 
already sufficiently frightened and troubled beforehand 


642 Lr-I. OLi. Il, 331-334. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2649-2652. 643 


because of my doings and my sins, yes, since | am 
already weary and burdened, | will not hear you, who are 
an accuser and a corrupter, but Christ, the Savior of the 
human race, who says that he came into the world to 
make sinners blessed, to comfort the despairing, to 
preach salvation to the captives 2c. This is the true and 
rightly so called Christ, and besides him no other. 

| can find the example of a holy life in Abraham, 
Isaiah, John the Baptist, Paul and other saints, but they 
cannot forgive my sins, free me from your power, O devil, 
and from death, make me blessed and give me life, for 
this belongs to Christ alone, whom the Father has 
sealed. Therefore | will not hear you as a teacher, but 
Christ, of whom the Father said, "This is my beloved Son, 
in whom | am well pleased; him shall you hear" [Matt. 
3:17, 17:5]. In this way, we should learn to be faithful in 
the face of temptation and the persuasion of false 
teaching, otherwise the devil will either seduce us with 
his servants or kill us with his fiery arrows. 


V. 9. A little leaven leavened the whole dough. 


Jerome and those who follow him blame St. Paul for 
converting many sayings of the Scriptures to another 
opinion that is not in them. Therefore, they say that what 
is contrary to one another in St. Paul is not contrary to 
one another in his original passage. But they unjustly 
accuse the apostle, who in a correct manner and with 
good forethought (prudenter) either makes general 
sayings into special ones, as he does above in the 3rd 
chapter [v. 13.He makes the general sentence: "Cursed 
is everyone who hangs on the wood" into a special one, 
because he applies it in the most appropriate way to 
Christ, or he makes special sayings into general ones, as 
he takes this special sentence: "A little leaven" 2c. ina 
general way, because he uses it to refer to doctrine, as 
in this passage where he speaks of justification, as well 
as to life and evil customs, as in 1 Cor. 5, 6. 





The whole letter testifies sufficiently how painful the 
fall of the Galatians had been for Paul, and how often he 
had impressed upon them, sometimes by scolding, 
sometimes by pleading, how great and immeasurable 
evils would follow their fall if they did not turn back. This 
fatherly and right 1) and apostolic concern and reminder 
did not move some at all, for many already no longer 
recognized Paul as their teacher, but preferred him far 
above the false apostles, from whom, as they dreamed, 
they had received the right teaching, not from Paul. 

Furthermore, the false apostles undoubtedly 
disparaged Paul among the Galatians in this way: that 
he was a stiff-necked and quarrelsome man who 
separated the unity of the churches for the sake of an 
exceedingly trivial matter, for no other reason than 
because he alone wanted to be wise, alone to be highly 
respected 2c. By this false accusation they made Paul 
hateful to many. Others, who had not yet entirely fallen 
away from Paul's teaching, thought there was no danger 
in departing a little from him in the doctrine of justification 
-and of faith; and therefore, hearing that Paul was 
making so tremendously great a thing of so little 
importance as it seemed to them, they wondered and 
thought: It may be, after all, that we have departed a little 
from Paul's teaching, and that something has been 
missed by us, but it is only a very little thing. Therefore, 
he should reasonably close his eyes to it, or at least not 
make it so great, so that the unity of the churches would 
not be torn apart by this small occasion. He answers 
them with this very beautiful proverbial saying: "A little 
leaven leaveneth the whole dough", and this is a 
warning which Paul respects greatly. 

(107) We too must pay great attention to this warning 
in this day and age. For the Sacramentarians, who deny 
the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, 
nowadays also accuse us of being quarrelsome, harsh 


and intractable, because we disrupt Christian love and 
the harmony of the churches because of the one article 
of the Sacrament. We are supposed to be

645 





We do not attach so much importance to this minor 
article, which, moreover, is uncertain and has not been 
sufficiently explained by the apostles (especially since 
they otherwise agree with us on the other articles of 
Christian doctrine, which are more necessary and more 
important), that for the sake of this article alone we do 
not take into consideration either the whole Christian 
doctrine or the general unity of all churches. 


(108) With this very apparent (plausible) reason, 
they not only make us hated by their own, but also 
mislead many good people, who judge that we deviate 
from them out of mere obstinacy or for some selfish 
(privato) motive. But these are the devil's ploys, by 
which he tries to overthrow not only this article, but the 
whole Christian doctrine. 

To this reason of theirs we answer with Paul: "A little 
leaven leaveneth the whole dough. In philosophy, if a 
small error is made at the beginning, a very great error 
comes out at the end. So in theology, a small error 
overturns the whole doctrine. Therefore, doctrine and 
life are to be separated from each other as far as 
possible. Doctrine is not ours, but God's, whose 
appointed servants we are only. That is why we cannot 
let up or change even one tittle of it. Life is ours, 
therefore, as far as it is concerned, the sacramentarians 
cannot demand anything from us that we do not want to 
and should not gladly take upon ourselves, take credit 
for and suffer, if only doctrine and faith remain 
unharmed; with regard to this, we always have this word 
of Paul in our mouths: "A little leaven" 2c. In this piece 
we cannot give way even a hair's breadth. For doctrine 
is like the mathematical point, and therefore cannot be 
divided, that is, it cannot suffer anything to be taken 
away or added. On the other hand, life, which is like the 
physical point, can always be divided, can always yield 
something. 

110. the smallest splinter in the eye damages the 
eye. Therefore the Germans say of the eye medicine: 
Nothing is good in the eyes, and Christ says [Matth. 6, 
22.]: "The eye is 


of the body light. If thine eye be single, thy whole body 
shall be light" 2c. [Luc. 11, 34.], and after that [v. 36.]: "If 
your body has no bit of darkness, it will be completely 
light" 2c. With this figurative speech Christ indicates that 
the eye, that is the doctrine, must be pure, clear and 
pure, so that it has absolutely no piece of darkness, no 
little cloud 2c., and Jacobus, not from his own spirit, but 
no doubt because he heard it from the apostles, said 
very beautifully [Jac. 2, 10.): "Whoever sins against 
One, is wholly guilty." Therefore the doctrine must be an 


uninterrupted (perpetuus) and round golden circle, in 
which there must be no crack. For as soon as even the 
smallest crack enters, the circle is no longer whole 2c. 
What does it profit the Jews that they believe in One 
God, namely the Creator of all things, that they also 
believe in other articles and accept the whole holy 
scripture, while they deny Christ? Therefore, whoever 
sins in One is entirely guilty. 

Therefore, this passage must be well noted against 


this argumentum, with which they slander us, that we 
violate love to the greatest harm of the church. We are 
certainly willing to keep peace with all and show them 
love, if only they will let us keep the doctrine of faith 
whole and unharmed. If we cannot obtain this, they 
demand love from us in vain. Cursed be the love which 
is kept to the detriment of the doctrine of faith, to which 
everything must give way, love, apostles, angels from 
heaven 2c. 

(112) Therefore, they sufficiently show how great 
they consider the glory of the word, since they 
slanderously belittle this matter. If they believed that it 
was the word of God, they would not play with it in this 
way, but would hold it in the highest esteem and ascribe 
faith to it without all disputation and doubt, 1) and would 
know that one word of God is all, and all words of God 
are one; likewise they would know that one article is all, 
and all articles are one, and that when one is lost, all are 
lost. For they hang

together and are embraced by a common bond. 
Therefore, let us let them glory in concord and 
Christian love, but let us exalt the glory of the word and 


faith. Love can be neglected at times (in loco) without 
danger, but not in the same way the word and faith. The 
task of love is to tolerate everything, to yield to all. On 
the other hand, it is the duty of faith to suffer nothing, to 
yield to no one. Love, which gladly yields, believes, 
accepts, and suffers all things, is often deceived; but 
when it is deceived, it does not receive such harm as 
might in truth be called harm, that is, it does not lose 
Christ, and is not angry because of it, but retains its way 
of always doing good, even to the ungrateful and 
unworthy. On the other hand, where blessedness is 
concerned, when false teachers teach lies and error 
under the appearance of truth and deceive many, one 
must certainly not let love prevail, nor approve of error. 
For here not a benefit is lost, which was done to an 
ungrateful person, but one loses the word, faith, Christ, 
eternal life 2c. 

Therefore, if you deny God in one article, you have 
denied Him in all, because God is not divided into many 
articles, but all is in each article, and One is in all articles. 
Therefore, we constantly answer the sacramentarians 
who accuse us of not respecting love with this saying of 
Paul: "A little leaven leavens the whole dough"; likewise: 
Discipline and honor, faith and eye suffer no jest. 1) 

(115) | have said this in many words in order to 
strengthen our people and to instruct others who may be 
annoyed by our constancy and think that we have no 


valid (certas) and important causes for this constancy. 
Therefore, let us not be moved by their boasting so 
much about their efforts for love and unity. For who*GOtt 


1) Cf. the note Col. 139, Cap. 2, s 78. 





and does not love his word, with him there is nothing in 
what or how much he loves. 

With this saying, Paul reminds both teachers and 
listeners not to think that the doctrine of faith is 
something small or trivial that we can play with as we 
please. It is the ray of sunshine that comes from heaven 
and enlightens, ignites and guides us. But just as the 
whole world, with all its wisdom and power, cannot bend 
the rays of the sun that descend straight from heaven to 
earth, so also nothing can be taken away from the 
doctrine of faith, nor can anything be added to it, or it will 
be completely perverted 2c. 


V. 10. I promise myself to you in the Lord. 


117 As if to say: | have reminded, fortified and chided 
you enough, if only you would listen. But | have good 
confidence in you in the Lord. 

118 Here the question arises whether Paul was right 
in saying that he had good confidence in the Galatians, 
especially since the Scriptures forbid trusting in men. 

Both faith and love believe, but they are different 
objects to which they are directed. Faith believes God, 
therefore it cannot be deceived; love believes man, 
therefore it is often deceived. But the confidence that 
love has is so necessary for the present life that life in 
the world could not exist without it. For if a man did not 
believe and trust another, what kind of life would we 
have on earth? Christians, because they have love, 
believe more easily than the children of this world. For 
good confidence in people is a fruit of the Spirit or 
Christian faith in the godly. Therefore Paul also has 
good confidence in the fallen Galatians, but in the Lord, 
as if he wanted to say: As far as | trust you, as the Lord 
is in you and you in him, that is, as far as you remain in 
the truth. If you fall away from it, deceived by the 
servants of Satan, | will no longer trust you either. In this 
way, the godly may believe and trust men.

649 








You will not be of a different mind. 
(120) Namely, as to the doctrine and faith as you 
have heard and learned from me, that is, | promise 
myself to you that you will not accept any other doctrine 
that differs from mine. 


But he that deceiveth you shall bear his judgment, 
whosoever he be. 

121 With this statement Paul condemns the false 
apostles like a judge sitting on the judgment seat and 
calls them by a very hateful name people who confuse 
the Galatians, who they thought were exceedingly godly 
people and much better teachers than Paul. 

122 At the same time, by this terrible judgment, with 
which he condemns the false apostles with such 
certainty, he wants to persuade the Galatians to avoid 
them as the most harmful pestilence, as if he wanted to 
say: What do you hear those harmful men who do not 
teach but only mislead you? The doctrine they teach you 
is nothing else than misleading the conscience. 
Therefore, however great they may be, they will receive 
their condemnation. 

But from these words: "Let him be who he will" it can 
be understood sufficiently that the false apostles were 
very good and extremely holy people according to the 
outward appearance, and perhaps there was among 
them some outstanding disciple of the apostles who was 
a man of great name and important reputation. For it is 
not in vain that he uses such great and significant words. 
In the same way he speaks Cap. 1, 8: "But if we, or an 
angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than 
that which we have preached to you, let him be 
accursed: Why does Paul violate love? Why is he so 
obstinate in so trifling a matter? Why is he so hasty in 
pronouncing the sentence of eternal damnation against 
those who are as much servants of Christ as he is? He 
cares nothing about all this, but curses and condemns in 
the most certain and certain way those who violate the 
doctrine of the faith, such as holy, learned and high 





respected people they may be in terms of outward 
appearance. 

In the same way, today we also consider as banished 
and condemned those who say that the article of the 
Sacrament of the Body and Blood of the Lord is 
uncertain, or who do violence to the words of Christ in 
the Lord's Supper. We want to have all articles of 
Christian doctrine, large and small (although for us none 
is small), pure and certain with the greatest rigor, and this 
is most necessary. For doctrine is our only light, which 
enlightens and guides us and shows us the way to 
heaven, if it has been made unstable in one piece, it must 
necessarily become completely unstable. Where this 
happens, love can help us nothing. We can be blessed 
without love and harmony with the sacramentans, but not 
without pure doctrine and faith. Otherwise, we will gladly 
show love to those who agree with us in all the articles 


of Christian doctrine (pie sentiunt), and we will keep unity 
with them. Even, as much as is in us, we want to keep 
peace with our enemies and pray for them who, out of 
ignorance, blaspheme our doctrine and persecute us. 
But let us not do the same to those who knowingly and 
against their conscience violate one or more articles of 
Christian doctrine. 

(125) And Paul teaches us here by his example to be 
so persistent, since he predicts with the utmost certainty 
that they will bear their judgment, because of a matter 
which, as it seemed to the false apostles and their 
disciples (for both thought, the former, that they taught 
rightly and godly, the latter, that they believed rightly and 
godly), was not only quite trivial, but also exceedingly 
unreasonable. Therefore, as | often remind you, doctrine 
must be carefully distinguished from life. Doctrine is 
heaven, life is earth. In life, sin, error, impurity and 
misery, as they say, are in vinegar. There, love should 
be able to endure, to suffer, to be deceived, to believe, 
to hope, to endure everything; there, the forgiveness of 
sins should be at its greatest, if only sin and error are not 
denied. But in the 


650 ar. vii. 1, 341-343. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2661-2664. 


651 





Doctrine, as there is no error in it, does not require 
forgiveness of sins. 

That is why doctrine and life cannot be compared to 
each other. A bag of doctrine is worth more than heaven 
and earth, so we do not suffer it to be violated in the 
slightest. But with the errors of life we can overlook a 
great deal (egregie). For we too are daily lacking in life| 
and conduct (moribus), all the saints are also lacking, and 
they earnestly confess this in the Lord's Prayer and in the 
holy Christian faith. But our doctrine is pure by God's 
grace; we have all articles of faith firmly and well founded 
in the holy Scriptures. The devil would like to defile and 
pervert them. That is why he attacks us so cunningly with 
this apparent reason of love and unity of the churches, 
which must not be violated 2c. 


But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why 
do I suffer persecution? Then the anguish of the cross 
would have ceased. 


In order to leave no stone unturned to bring the 
Galatians back into line, Paul now brings a proof taken 
from his own example. He says that by denying the 
righteousness of circumcision, | have incurred the 
bitterest hatred and persecution of the chief priests, the’ 
elders of the people, and all my fellow-citizens. If | were 
to attribute righteousness to circumcision, the Jews would 
not only not persecute me, but would also praise and love 
me. But now, because | preach the gospel of Christ and 
the righteousness of faith, since the law and circumcision 
have been done away, | suffer persecution. 

On the other hand, the false apostles, in order not to 
suffer the cross and this bitter hatred of the Jewish 
people, preach circumcision, and so they put themselves 
in favor with the Jews and keep them as friends. Thus he 
says below, Cap. 6, 12: "They compel you to be 
circumcised" 2c. Moreover, they would have liked to bring 
about that there would be no discord at all, but the highest 
peace and unity between Gentiles and Jews. But it is 
impossible 





It is essential that this be done without harming the 
doctrine of faith, which is a doctrine of the cross and full 
of anguish. 

Therefore, when he says, "If I still preach 
circumcision, why do | suffer persecution? If | still preach 
circumcision, why do | suffer persecution?" he means to 
indicate that it would be a great inconsistency and 


something quite wrong (indignitatem) if the persecution 
of the cross had ceased. In the same way he speaks 1 
Cor. 1, 17: "Christ sent me to preach the gospel, not with 
wise words, lest the cross of Christ should come to 
nothing", as if he wanted to say: | would not like the 
trouble and the cross of Christ to be taken away. 

Here someone would like to say: According to this, 
the Christians are extremely nonsensical that they 
expose themselves to dangers of their own free will. For 
by their preaching they accomplish nothing but to invite 
the wrath and hatred of the world upon themselves and 
to arouse vexation. That is, as he says, to labor in vain 
and to strive for nothing but hatred. This, says Paul, is 
not offensive to us and gives us nothing to strive for, but 
only makes us stout-hearted and urges us to have good 
hope for the prosperity and growth of the church, which 
flourishes and grows under the cross. For Christ, the 
head and bridegroom of the church, must reign in the 
midst of his enemies, Ps. 110:2. On the other hand, 
when the cross is taken down, and the rage of the tyrants 
and heretics, as well as the arousal, has ceased, and the 
devil keeps his palace, and all is at peace, it is a sure 
sign that the pure doctrine of the Word is gone. 

This was also noted by Bernard, who said that the 
church is at its best when it is attacked on all sides by 
Satan with violence and cunning, and at its worst when 
it lives in the highest peace. And in a beautiful way he 


draws by a somewhat hard trope (per catachresin) this 
word from the song of Hezekiah [Is. 38, 17. according to 
the Vulgate]: "Behold, in peace my bitterness is most 
bitter", which [Hezekiah] lives in the person of the church 
in security and peace. 

132. that is why Paul considers this to be a very 


652 Lri. Oai. Il, 343-343. Explanation of Galatians 5, 11. W. 


VIII, 2664-2368. 653 





This is a sure sign that the gospel is not one in which 
peace remains when it is preached. On the other hand, 
the world takes this for a certain sign that the gospel is a 
heretical and seditious doctrine, because it sees that the 
preaching of it is followed by great unrest, disruption, 
uproar, sectarianism. Thus God puts on the larva of the 
devil, and the devil the larva of God, and God wants to 
be recognized under the larva of the devil and wants the 
devil to be rejected under the larva of God. 

The agony of the cross" can be understood in an 


active and in a passive way'. The cross immediately 
follows the teaching of the word, according to the saying 
Ps. 116, 10: "I believe, therefore | speak. But | am greatly 
afflicted." 

But the cross of the Christians is their persecution, 
because they suffer shame, and yet no one has 
compassion on them, and therefore it is very annoying. 
First, they suffer as if they were the most wicked of 
evildoers, and this is what the prophet Isaiah himself 
foretold of Christ, Cap. 53:12: "He is numbered with the 
transgressors. Then the punishments of murderers, 
thieves, 2c. are lightened, and men are moved by 
compassion toward them; there is no anger connected 
with the punishment. On the other hand, the world 
thinks, as it judges, that Christians are harmful people, 
that no punishment severe enough can be inflicted on 
them for their misdeeds, and is not moved by pity, but 
inflicts on them the most disgraceful death penalty, and 
thinks that it derives a twofold advantage from it, first, 
that it does God a service by killing them, and second, 
that it hopes that public peace will be restored when 
these harmful people are done with. Therefore, the cross 
and the death of the blessed are full of aversions. 

135 But, says Paul, let not this shameful treatment 


(indignitas) and the long duration of the cross of Christ 
and the aversion move you, but rather let this move you 


1) "The aggravation of the cross" in an active way is the 
aggravation which the preaching of the cross causes to the 
unbelievers; in a suffering way the annoying suffering which the 
believers, the confessors of the gospel, have to endure. 





For as long as this lasts, Christianity (res christiana) is 
very well off. In this way, Christ also comforts his 
followers, Matth. 5, 11. 12: "Blessed are you," he says, 
"when men revile and persecute you because of me, and 
speak all kinds of evil against you, if they lie about it. Be 
glad and of good cheer, for you will be well rewarded in 
heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets that were 
before you." The Church will not let this joy be snatched 
away from her. That is why | would not like the pope, 
bishops, princes, and gushers to be united with us. 
Because such unity would be a certain sign that we have 
lost the right doctrine. 

In short, as long as the church teaches the gospel 
purely, it must suffer persecution. For the gospel praises 
the mercy and glory of God and exposes the wickedness 
and wiles of the devil and paints him with his proper 
colors, stripping him of the robe of divine majesty with 
which he deceives the whole world, that is, it shows that 
all worship, religiones, orders, devised by men, likewise 
the statutes of celibacy, of food, 2c., by which men think 
they can earn forgiveness of sins and eternal life, are 
ungodly things and doctrines of the devils. Therefore, the 
devil is tempted by nothing more than by the preaching 
of the gospel. For it takes away the guise of God and 
reveals him for who he really is, namely the devil, not 
God. Therefore, it is impossible that the anger of the 
cross does not follow when the gospel blossoms, or 
surely the devil is not really hit, but only gently stroked. 
When he is struck, he does not rest, but begins to rage 
terribly and to shatter everything. 

137 Therefore, Christians (if they want to keep the 
word otherwise) should not be angry or frightened when 


they see the devil loose and raging (ruptis habenis 


furere), that the whole world is stirred up, that tyrants 
show their cruelty, that sects arise, but should certainly 
know that these are signs of which one should not be 
frightened, but of which one should rejoice, as Christ 
interprets it [Matth. 5, 12.] 


654 i. kai. 1, 345-347. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2668-2675. 


655 





joyful and confident" 2c. Far be it, therefore, that the 
vexation of the cross be lifted, which would happen if we 
preached what the prince of this world and his members 
gladly heard, namely, the righteousness of works, and 
then we would have a gracious devil, a favorable world, 
an inclined pope and prince. . But because we praise the 
benefits and glory of Christ, they persecute us and take 
away our goods and our bodies. 


V. 12. Would to God that they also were cut off 
who disturb you. 


Is this apostolic, then, that he not only declares that 
the false apostles are destroyers, that he condemns 
them and hands them over to the devil, but also wishes 
them to be completely cut off and perish, which is clearly 
cursing? But | think that Paul alludes to circumcision, as 
if he wanted to say: They force you to be circumcised, 
but God wanted them to be cut out from the roots. 

Here the question arises whether a Christian may 
curse. He may, but not always and for any reason. If it 
has come to the point that the word is to be cursed or the 
teaching blasohemed, and consequently God Himself, 
then reverse the judgment and say: Praise be to God and 
His word, and cursed be everything that is besides the 
word and God, be it an apostle or an angel from heaven. 
Thus he said above, Cap. 1, 8. "So also we or an angel 
from heaven," 2c., "let him be accursed." There you can 
see that Paul respects "a little leaven" so great, that he 
also presumes to curse the false apostles, who according 
to outward appearance were men of great renown and 
great holiness. Therefore, we should not disregard the 
leaven of doctrine, for however little it may be, if it is 
despised, it is the cause that one gradually loses truth 
and blessedness, and denies God. For if the word is 
falsified and (what must necessarily follow) God is denied 
and blasphemed, there remains no hope of salvation. But 
if we are blaspohemed, cursed and killed, nevertheless He 
is still present who 


can resurrect us, free us from the curse, death and hell. 

Therefore, we should learn to make the majesty and 
prestige of the Word great and glorious. For it is not 
something small, as the enthusiasts think nowadays, but 
a tittle is greater than heaven and earth. Therefore, we 
do not take love or Christian unity into consideration, but 
use the judgment seat, that is, we curse and condemn 
all who in the slightest way pervert or violate the majesty 
of the divine Word, for a little leaven leaveneth the whole 
dough. But if they leave us the word whole and 
unharmed, we are ready not only to maintain love and 
unity with them, but also to offer to be their servants and 
to do everything. But if they do not want this, they may 
perish and be cast into hell, not only they, but also the 
whole world with the pious and the ungodly, only that 
God may remain. If he remains, life and blessedness 
also remain, and the godly will also remain. 

Therefore Paul is right in cursing these destroyers 
and pronouncing the sentence that they are cursed with 
all that they are, teach and do, and that he wishes them 
to be cut off from this life and especially from the church, 
that is, that God will not give prosperity and happiness 
to their teachings and all their activities, and this curse 
came from the Holy Spirit. Thus Peter curses Apost. 8, 
20 to Simon. He says: "That you be damned with your 
money" 2c. And in the Holy Scriptures there are many 
curses against such destroyers of consciences, 
especially in the Psalms, such as Ps. 55:16: "Death 
overtakes them, and they must go to hell alive"; likewise 
[Ps. 9:18]: "Oh, that the wicked should be turned to hell." 

Up to this point, Paul has fortified the article of 
justification with the strongest grounds of proof. Then, in 
order to leave nothing to be desired, he has added here 
and there to this discussion (disputation!) words of 
reproach, praise, exhortations, threats 2c. At the end he 
has also cited his own example that he suffers 
persecution

657 





because of this doctrine, and thereby admonishes all the} The first part of the doctrine, which they have presented 
godly not to be angry and frightened if they should see} to the faith and taught to the consciences, also adds 
that in the time of the gospel turmoil, agitations, sects 2c.| commandments concerning conduct, by which they 


arise, but rather to rejoice and be confident. For the more! exhort the faithful to perform the Christian duties (officia 


the world rages against the gospel, the better is the 


cause (negotium) of the gospel. 

This should be the most pleasant comfort for us 
today. For it is certain that the world hates and 
persecutes us for no other cause than because we 
confess the truth of the gospel. It does not accuse us of 
being thieves, adulterers, murderers, etc., but abhors 
only this one thing about us, that we teach Christ in a 
godly and pure way and do not want to stop protecting 
the truth. Therefore we can already see from the fact that 
our teaching is holy and divine that the world hates it so 
bitterly. For otherwise there is no doctrine so ungodly, 
foolish, ridiculous, corrupt, which the world does not 


gladly accept, admire (exosculatur) and defend, then also 
treat reverently, favor, flatter and do everything [to will] to 
the professors of it. But the doctrine, which serves for 
godliness, life and blessedness, and the servants of the 
same it detests to the highest degree, does it all dishonor’ 
2c. This, then, is a striking proof that the world is so to us 
only because it hates the Word. 

(144) Therefore, when the adversaries reproach us 
that nothing else arises from this teaching but wars, riots, 
agitations, mobs, and innumerable other evils, we should 
answer: Blessed be the day when we may see this. But 
[they say] the whole world will be aroused. Quite so; if it 
were not agitated and the devil did not rage so and put 
everything into unrest, we would not have the pure 
doctrine, which must be followed by this unrest and 
raging. Therefore we take this as a very great good, 
which you believe to be something evil. 


Doctrine of good works. 


145 Now follow exhortations and commandments 


concerning right conduct (de bonis moribus). For the 
apostles have this habit, that after they have taught the 
doctrine of the 


pietatis) on one another, and this part of the doctrine is 
also understood and taught to some extent by reason, 
but of the doctrine of faith it knows nothing at all. 

So that it does not appear as if the Christian doctrine 
abolishes a good conduct and disputes against the 
orders of the world regime, the apostle also exhorts to 
good works 1) and honorable outward conduct, to 
observe love, harmony 2c. Therefore the world cannot 
justly accuse Christians of abolishing right conduct, of 
destroying public peace, respectability 2c., because they 
teach [right] conduct and all virtues better than anyone 
else, whether philosophers or persons in authority, 
because they accept faith [in doing so]. 2) 


But you, brethren, are called to freedom. But see 
to it that through freedom you do not give place to 
the flesh, but through love serve one another. 


147 As if he wanted to say: You have already attained 
freedom through Christ, that is, you are above all laws 
according to conscience and before God, you are happy 


(beati) and blessed (salvi), Christ is your life. Therefore, 
although the law, sin and death terrify you, they can 
neither harm you nor plunge you into despair. This is 
your glorious and inestimable freedom. Now it behooves 
you to be careful that you do not give place to the flesh 
through freedom. 

This evil is extremely widespread, and it is the worst 
thing that Satan instigates in the doctrine of faith, 
namely, that he immediately draws this freedom, with 
which Christ has set us free, in many to give place to the 
flesh. This is what Jude complains about in his epistle, 
saying [v. 4]: "Some people have crept in next to us who 
are ungodly and deprive the grace of our God.

659 





tes on the will of God." For the flesh understands nothing 
at all of the doctrine of grace, namely, that we are not 
justified by works but by faith alone, that the law has no 
right over us. Therefore, as soon as it hears this 
doctrine, it draws it upon itself, and immediately makes 
this conclusion: "If we are without law, let us live as we 
please; let us do nothing good, let us give nothing to the 
poor, much less let us suffer anything evil. For there is 
no law to compel or bind us. 

Therefore there is danger on both sides, but one is 
more bearable than the other. If grace or faith is not 
preached, no one is saved, for faith alone makes one 
righteous and saved. On the other hand, when faith is 
preached, as it must necessarily be preached, the 
greater part of men understand the doctrine of faith 
carnally, and prefer the freedom of the spirit to the 
freedom of the flesh. This can be seen today in all 
classes, high and low. All boast that they are 
evangelical, boast of Christian freedom, and yet follow 
their lusts, turn to avarice, pleasure, pride, envy 2c. No 
one does his duty faithfully, no one serves others 


through love 2c. This shameful behavior (indignitas) 
sometimes makes me so impatient that | often wish that 
such sows, who trample the pearls with their feet, were 
still under the tyranny of the pope. For it is impossible 
that this people of Gomorrah should be governed by the 
gospel of peace. 

150 Then we ourselves, who teach the word, do not 
do our duty in the light of truth with such diligence and 
zeal as we did before in the darkness of ignorance. For 
the more certain we are of this liberty which Christ has 
acquired for us, the colder and more indolent we are in 
dealing with the word, in praying, in doing good works, 
in suffering evil, 2c., and if Satan did not afflict us 
inwardly with spiritual temptations, and outwardly with 
persecutions of the adversaries, and likewise with 
contempt and ingratitude from our own people, we 
would become quite sure, lazy, and unskilled in every 
good work, and thus in time lose the knowledge of the 
truth. 





Those who do not believe in Christ and faith in him would 
leave the ministry of the word and seek a way of life that 
is more comfortable for the flesh. Many of our people are 
already beginning to do this, moved by the fact that, 
while working in the Word, they not only cannot earn their 
living from it, but are also treated most shamefully by 
those who, through the preaching of the Gospel, have 
freed them from the most miserable bondage of the 
pope. They leave the poor and annoying Christ, involve 
themselves in the affairs of this life and serve their belly, 


not Christ, but what they will gain from it (quo fructu), 
they will learn in time. 

151. Since we know that the devil is after us, who 
have the word, in the strongest way (for he holds the 
others captive according to his will) and is eager to take 
this freedom of the spirit from us, or at least to cause us 
to take it by force, Therefore, following the example of 
Paul, we teach and admonish our people with the 
greatest diligence and care, that they should not believe 
that this freedom of the Spirit, which Christ acquired 
through his death, was given to them for the purpose of 
giving place to the flesh, or, as Peter says [1 Pet. 2:16], 
that they might have it to cover wickedness, but that they 
might serve one another through love. 

So that, as we have said, Christians do not abuse 
this freedom, the apostle imposes a bondage on their 
flesh through the law of love among one another; 
therefore let the godly remember that for Christ's sake 
they are free in conscience before God from the curse of 
the law, from sin, and from death, but that they are 
servants in body. Here, according to this commandment 
of Paul, one should serve the other through love. 
Therefore, let each one strive to do his duty carefully in 
his profession and to help his neighbor in whatever way 
he can. This is what Paul demands of us in these words: 
"By love serve one another," which do not let the saints 
be free according to the flesh, but subject them to 
bondage 2c. 

But this doctrine, that we should show love to one 
another, cannot be applied in any way.

|, 2682-2685. 





The Christians are happy to obey them in this. Christians 
are happy to obey this. But others, when this freedom is 
preached, immediately conclude: "If | am free, | may do 
what | want. This thing is mine, why should | not sell it as 
dear as | can? Likewise: Since we are not blessed 
because of our good works, why should we give to the 
poor? 2c. These surely shake off this yoke and bondage 
of the flesh, and draw the freedom of the spirit upon 
licentiousness and wantonness of the flesh. To these 
sure despisers we proclaim for certain (although they do 
not believe us, but ridicule us) that if they use their bodies 
and goods according to their will (as they certainly do, 
because they do not help the needy, do not give right 
goods in trade [non mutuum dant], but defraud the 
brethren, usurp them with right and wrong 2c.) that they, 
| say, are not free, however much they may boast of it, 
but that they have lost Christ and freedom and are 
servants of the devil, and that they are now seven times 
worse under the name of Christian freedom than before 
under the tyranny of the pope. For the devil, who had 
been cast out, has again entered into them, having taken 
with him seven other spirits more wicked than he 2c. 
Therefore it became worse with them afterwards than it 
was before [Matth. 12, 45]. 

We have the divine command to preach the gospel, 
which proclaims to all men that they are free from the 
law, from sin, from death, from the wrath of God by grace 
for Christ's sake, if only they believe. 2c. It is not in our 
will or power to hide this freedom, which has already 
been made known through the gospel, from men or to 
revoke it, because Christ gave it to us and brought it 
about through his death, and we cannot force even those 
sows who fall by force into the unbridled nature of the 
flesh to serve others with their bodies and goods. 
Therefore, we do what we can, that is, we diligently 
exhort them to do so. If we do not achieve anything with 
our exhortations, then we order the matter to be settled. 





GOtte; who in his time will inflict the deserved 
punishments on these despisers. 

In the meantime, we are comforted by the fact that 
our work and diligence on the blessed is not in vain, 
many of whom have undoubtedly been torn out of the 
bondage of the devil through our service and brought 
into this freedom of the spirit. These few, who recognize 
the glory of this freedom of the spirit and are again ready 
to serve others through love, and know that they are 
debtors of the brethren according to the flesh, please us 
more than the countless multitude of those who abuse 
this freedom can grieve us. 

156 Paul speaks with quite proper and clear words 
when he says: "But you, dear brethren, are called to 
freedom. Now lest anyone dream that he is speaking of 
the freedom of the flesh, he himself explains what kind 
of freedom he means by saying, "Only see to it that 
through freedom you do not give place to the flesh, but 
through love serve one another." Therefore let every 
Christian know that through Christ he has been made 
Lord in his conscience over the law, sin, death 2c. so 
that these have no right over him 2c. On the other hand, 
he should also know that this outward bondage is laid 
upon his body, that he should serve his neighbor through 
love. But he who understands Christian liberty differently 
uses the goods of the gospel to his own destruction, and 
is a worse idolater under the name of a Christian than he 
was before under the pope. Now Paul goes on to make 
clear from the holy ten commandments what it means to 
"serve through love". 


For all the laws are fulfilled in one word: Love 
your neighbor as yourself. 


After Paul laid the foundation of the Christian 
doctrine, he used to build gold, silver and precious 
stones on it. But the foundation is none other, as he says 
in the first letter to the Corinthians [Cap. 3, 11], than 
Jesus Christ himself or the righteousness of Christ. On 
this foundation he builds good works, and indeed truly 
good works, which he summarizes in this short 
commandment: "Love your neighbor as your neighbor. 


662 avi. 6ai. 1, 355-357. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2685-2688. 


663 








yourself," as if to say: When | say that you shall serve 
one another by love, | mean the same thing that the law 
says elsewhere [Deut. 19:18.], "You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself." This means to interpret the 
Scriptures and the commandments of God correctly. 
The thought that the Sophists have of the word "love" 
is quite cold and null. For they say that to love is nothing 
other than to grant good to someone, or that love is a 


quality (qualitatem) inherent in the mind (inhaerentem 
animo) by which man produces (elicit) a movement of 
the heart or an action that is called "granting good" (bene 


velle). This is a quite naked, meager and mathematical 
1) love, which, that | say so, has not taken on flesh and 


blood (non est incarnata), nor does it come to action. On 
the other hand, Paul says that love must be a servant, 
and if it is not in the exercise of service, it is not love. 
159) But by citing the commandment of love, he 
attacks in passing (oblique) at the same time the useless 


(vanos) teachers, against whom he directs his arrows, in 
order also to defend and fortify his doctrine of works 
against them, as if to say: Hitherto | have taught you, 
dear Galatians, the right and spiritual life; now | will also 
teach you truly good works, and that for this reason, that 
ye may know that those ridiculous and raving works of 
ceremonies, which the false apostles alone insist upon, 
are far inferior to the works of love. For this is the folly 
and the rage of all godless teachers and enthusiasts, 
that they not only leave the right ground and the pure 
and well-founded doctrine, but also, because they cling 
to their superstition, do not touch the right good works, 
and therefore, as Paul says [1 Cor. 3:12], build on the 
ground only wood, hay and stubble. Thus the false 
apostles, who were the most vehement defenders of 
works, did not teach or insist that works of love should 
be done, that Christians should love one another, that 
they should be ready to help their neighbor in any way. 


1) mathematica, that is, that exists only in the imagination, like the 
mathematical point. 





They insisted only on the need to keep circumcision, to 
observe days, months, etc. They could not teach other 
good works, because if Christ is destroyed and the 
doctrine of faith is darkened, it is impossible that the right 
custom, the right practice, the right understanding of 
good works should be kept. Nor could they teach other 
good works, for when the foundation, Christ, is 
destroyed, and the doctrine of faith is darkened, it is 
impossible for the right custom, the right practice, the 
right understanding of good works to remain. For when 
the tree is taken away, the fruit must necessarily be 
taken away also. 

(160) In the same way, nowadays, the spirits of the 
pagans talk about the doctrine of good deeds. Therefore, 
it is necessary for them to teach only fanatical and 
superstitious works. They have taken away Christ, they 
have cut down the tree, they have overturned the 
foundation, therefore they build on the sand and can 
build on nothing but wood, hay and stubble. They 
pretend to love masterfully, humility 2c., but in reality 
they do not love with action and with truth, as John says 
[1 Ep. 3, 18], but only with words and with the tongue 2c. 
They feign great holiness, and by this feigned holiness 
they deceive men into thinking that their works are 
delicious and pleasing to God. But if you look at this in 
the light of the Word, you will find that they are only 
juggleries with ridiculous and trivial things that only 
concern place, time, clothes, reputation of the person 2c. 

For this reason, it is just as necessary for godly 
teachers to insist as diligently on the doctrine of works 
as on the doctrine of faith. For Satan is opposed to both 
doctrines and resists them most fiercely. But faith must 
be planted first, for without it it is impossible to 
understand what is a good work that pleases God. 

162) That Satan also hates the doctrine of true good 
works is evident from this. For although all men have a 
certain natural knowledge implanted in their hearts, by 
which they are naturally convinced that one must do to 
another as he would have him do to him, that he must 
not be made to feel that he is being made a fool. 


664 Il, 357-389. 


Explanation of Galatians 5, 14. 





Epistle to the Galatians 5, 14, W. VIII, 2688-269T. 
(this sentence and similar ones, which we call the 


natural law, are the basis of human law and all good 
works), but human reason is so corrupted and blind by 


the devil's guilt (Vitio) that it does not understand this 
innate knowledge, or even if it understands it, reminded 
by God's word, it still knowingly neglects and despises it 
(so great is the power of Satan). 

163) Then there is the evil that the devil so listens to 
all those who deal with their own righteousness 


(justitiarios) and to all heretics that they leave the 
doctrine of truly good works undone and only insist on 


childish ceremonies or whimsical (portentosa) works 
that they themselves have devised. Reason, which does 
not understand anything about faith, regards these as 
great and delights in them extraordinarily. Thus, the 
people in the papacy did many such foolish and futile 
works, which God neither commands nor demands, with 
great pleasure, diligence, zeal, and at great cost. 

164 We see the same zeal for futile things today 
among the "Rottirer" and their disciples, but especially 
among the Anabaptists. But in our churches, where the 
right doctrine of good works is most diligently practiced, 
one cannot be too surprised to see that there is a great 
deal of sluggishness and sleepiness. The more we 
exhort and incite people to do good works, to show love 
for one another, to lay aside their belly care, etc., the 
more sluggish and cold they become to all exercises of 
godliness. Therefore Satan with all his might hates and 
hinders not only the doctrine of faith, but also of good 
works; here, that our people should not learn them, or, 
if they know them, do not put them into practice; there, 
the hypocrites and heretics neglect them altogether, and 
in the meantime teach foolish ceremonies, or ridiculous 
and fanciful works, instead of them, by which people are 
taken in and delight in them. For the world is not ruled 
by the gospel and faith, but by the law and superstition. 

The apostle therefore earnestly exhorts Christians 
that after they have heard and accepted the pure 
doctrine of faith, 


665 


should also perform righteous works. For even in the 
justified there remain remnants of sin, which strive 
against faith as well as against right good works, and 
draw away from them. Then human reason and the 
flesh, which in the saints is opposed to the Spirit (but in 
the ungodly it reigns with all its might), is naturally 


moved (afficitur) by Pharisaic superstition, that is, it 
takes more pleasure in God being measured according 
to the thoughts of reason and the flesh than according 
to fine words, and does with much greater zeal the 
works that it has chosen for itself than those that God 
has commanded. Therefore, godly teachers must take 
as much trouble to teach and inculcate love that is not 
feigned, or to insist on truly good works, as they take 
trouble to teach faith. 

Therefore, let no one think that he knows this 
commandment perfectly: "Love your neighbor" 2c. It is 
indeed very short and quite easy, as far as the words 
are concerned, but where are teachers and listeners 
who "practiced" and performed this rightly with teaching, 
learning and living? Therefore these words: "By love 
serve one another,” are the same: "Love thy neighbor as 
thyself," are eternal words, which no godly person 
sufficiently considers, insists upon, and practices, and, 
what is to be wondered at, the godly have this challenge, 
that their conscience immediately afflicts them, if they 
omit even a very slight thing, which they should have 
done, but not also if they neglect love (which happens 
daily), and their heart is not pure and brotherly-minded 
toward their neighbor. For they do not regard the 
commandment of love as great as their superstition, 
from which they are not completely free in this life 2c. 

Therefore Paul accuses the Galatians with these 
words: "For all the laws are fulfilled in one word", as if he 
wanted to say: You are lovely people, drowned in 
superstition and your ceremonies of place, time, food 1) 
which benefit neither you nor others, and meanwhile you 
neglect love, which should have been practiced alone.

What folly this is! Jerome also says: "We hurt our bodies 
with vigilance, fasting, work 2c., and we neglect love, 
which alone is the mistress and master of works. And 


this is seen in a particularly conspicuous way (egregie) 
in the monks, who most strictly observe their statutes of 
ceremonies, food, clothing 2c.. If they omit anything, 
even the slightest thing, they commit a mortal sin. But if 
they not only neglect love, but also hate each other most 
bitterly, they do not sin or transgress against God. 

Therefore, with this commandment, Paul not only 
teaches good works, but also condemns foolish and 
superstitious works. For he not only builds gold, silver 
and precious stones on the ground, but also destroys 
the wood, burns the hay and the stubble. 

God did well to give the Jews many ceremonies, for 
by doing so He wanted to show that the naturally 
superstitious heart of man does not ask anything about 
love, but is inclined to ceremonies and takes pleasure in 
carnal righteousness. But in the meantime, God also 
testified by example in the Old Testament how highly He 
had always esteemed love and wanted even the law 
with its ceremonies to give way to it. Since David was 
hungry and those with him had nothing to eat, they ate 
the holy bread, which according to the law only the 
priests were allowed to eat, but not the laity 2c. The 
disciples broke the Sabbath by plucking ears of corn. 
Christ himself also broke the Sabbath, as the Jews 
interpreted it, by healing the sick on the Sabbath. All this 
indicates that love must be given priority over all laws 
and ceremonies, and that God requires nothing from us 
so much as love for our neighbor. Christ also testifies to 
the same when he says [Matth. 22, 39]: "The other is 
equal to it" [2c.]. 


V. 14. For all the laws are fulfilled in One Word, 
in which: Love your neighbor as yourself. 


170 As if to say: Why do you burden yourselves with 
the law? Why do you bother 


you anxiously and torment yourselves with the 
ceremonies of the law of meals, days, places 2c. ? that 
lone must eat, drink, keep holidays, sacrifice 2c. in such 


la way? Leave off these useless things (ineptiis) and hear 
what | say. All laws are fully comprehended in this One 
Word: "Love your neighbor as yourself." God certainly 
lhas no pleasure nor need of this observation of legal 
customs, but now requires this of you, that you believe in 
Christ, whom He Himself sent; then you are perfect in 
Him and have everything. But if you want to add laws to 
faith, which is the most pleasing service of God, then you 
should know that all laws are included in this very short 
commandment: "Love your neighbor as yourself. Strive 
to keep this commandment, and if it is kept, you will be 
lable to 
If you have done this, you will have fulfilled all the laws. 
And Paul is the best interpreter of the commandments 
lof God, for he sums up the whole of Moses in a very short 
lsum, and shows that in all his laws, which are almost 
innumerable, nothing else is contained in a short epitome 
than this exceedingly short word: "Love thy neighbor as 
thyself. Reason is annoyed by these small and few 
words, because it says so briefly: "Believe in Christ", and 
likewise: "Love your neighbor as yourself". Therefore it 
despises both, the doctrine of faith and of truly good 
works. But in the meantime, this very small and 
lexceedingly short 1) word of faith: "Faith in Christ" is for 
tthe believers a power of God, by which they overcome 
isin, death, devil 2c., by which they attain blessedness. 
172 Thus, as reason judges, the works of serving one 
lanother through love are of no consequence, namely, 
that one teaches the erring, comforts the afflicted. The 
works, as one serves others through love, are of no 
importance, namely, that one teaches the erring, 
comforts the afflicted, straightens out the weak, helps 
lone's neighbor, with which one can only always, that one 
credits him for his coarse nature (agrestes mores) and his 
unmannerliness, that one in the church and in the world 
regiment bears with equanimity complaints, labors, the 
ingratitude and contempt of the people, obeys the 
authorities, honors one's parents, and is at home.

669 





Be patient with a quarrelsome wife, with troublesome 
servants 2c. But believe me, they are such glorious and 
delicious works that the whole world cannot comprehend 
their usefulness and dignity (for it does not measure the 
works or any other things by God's word, but by the 
judgment of the godless, blind and foolish reason), yes, 
it cannot even duly appreciate the value of a single, even 
the smallest truly good work. 

Men are therefore far wrong if they dream that they 
understand the commandment of love. They have it 
written in their hearts, because they judge by nature that 
one should do to another what he wishes to be done to 
him, but from this it does not follow that they understand 
it, otherwise they would also prove it by deed and prefer 
love to all works, and would not esteem their water 
bubbles so highly and make so much fuss about them, 
that is, their antics and superstitions, as there are: 
Walking with a sad face and head hanging, being 
celibate, living on water and bread, living in the desert, 
using little clothing, and the like. These strange 


(prodigiosa) and superstitious works, which they choose 
themselves, while God neither commands nor approves 
them, they consider so glorious and holy that they far 
surpass and obscure love, which is the sun of all works. 
The blindness of human reason is so incomprehensible 
and boundless that it cannot judge correctly not only 
about the doctrine of faith, but also about life and works. 

174. Therefore, we must fight with all our might, not 
only against the opinions of our heart, on which we 
would naturally rather base ourselves in matters of 
salvation than on the word of God, but also against the 
shell and the holy appearance of self-chosen works, and 
thus learn to esteem the works that each one does in his 
profession as great, even though they seem small and 
contemptible when they have only God's command, to 
esteem great the works that each one does in his 
profession, even though they seem small and 
contemptible in appearance, if they have only God's 
command, and on the other hand to despise the works 
that reason chooses without God's command, no matter 
how glorious, important, great and holy they may seem. 

175. this commandment | have elsewhere diligently 





and abundantly covered, so | will just run through it 
briefly now. It is a short word and beautifully and 
powerfully spoken: "Love your neighbor as yourself." No 
one can give a better, more certain and more real 
example than himself. And there can be no nobler and 


more highly esteemed virtuous conduct (profundior 


habitus) than love, and no more excellent object to which 
love is directed than one's neighbor. Therefore, the 


example, the behavior and the object (objectum) are the 
noblest. 

Therefore, if you wish to know how to love your 
neighbor and have a clear example of it, pay careful 
attention to how you love yourself. Surely, in distress 
and danger, you would most heartily desire to be loved 
and to be helped with all the counsel, goods and 
strength of all men and creatures. Therefore, you do not 
need a book to instruct and admonish you on how to love 
your neighbor, for you have the most beautiful and best 
book, which contains all laws, in your heart. You do not 
need a teacher in this matter, but only consult your own 
heart, which will teach you abundantly that your 
neighbor should be loved as you love yourself. 

Furthermore, love is the highest virtue, which is not 
only ready to serve with tongue, hand, money and 
goods, but also with the body and even the life, and is 
not induced to do so by merit or anything else, nor is it 
hindered by any indebtedness, ingratitude 2c. [of the 
neighbor]. A mother nurtures, cares for 2c. her child 
because she loves it 2c. 

Finally, no living creature toward which you should 
practice love is more noble than your neighbor. He is not 
a devil, not a lion, bear, wolf, not stone, wood, etc., but 
a being that is quite like you, and there is none living on 
earth that is more lovely, more amiable, more useful, 
more kind, more comforting, and more necessary, and 
that is created by nature for friendly intercourse and 
social life. Therefore, in the whole wide world, nothing 
could be presented to us that would be more worthy of 
our love than our neighbor. 

179 But that is the wonderful art of the 


670 Lri. 6*1. 11, 364-368. ill, 1. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2698-2761. 


671 





Devil, that he can not only darken this noblest object [of 
our love] most strongly and tear it out of the heart, but 
also persuade the heart of the completely opposite 
opinion, so that it thinks that the neighbor is not worthy 
of love, but of the bitterest hatred, and this he can do 
very easily. He only reproaches you: Behold, this man 
has such a fault in himself, he has reviled you, he has 
harmed you 2c. Then this lovable object immediately 
becomes contemptible, so that he is no longer 
recognized as the neighbor whom one should love, but 
is taken for an enemy who is worthy of the greatest 
hatred. In this way, Satan can wonderfully change the 


habitum of love in our hearts, so that we turn from lovers 
of our neighbor into people who belittle, hate and 
persecute him, and from this commandment: "Love your 
neighbor as yourself," nothing remains in us but the mere 
and empty letters and syllables. 

But our neighbor is every human being, especially 
the one who needs our help, as Christ interprets Luc. 
10:30 ff. Even if he has offended me or harmed me in 
some way, he has not taken off his human nature 


(humanitatem) or ceased to be flesh, blood and a 
creature of God that is completely equal to me; in short, 
he does not cease to be my neighbor. As long as the 
human being remains in him, so long does the 
commandment of love remain, which demands of me 
that | do not despise my flesh, that | do not repay evil 
with evil, but overcome evil with good, otherwise love will 
never tolerate everything, endure everything 2c., 1 Cor. 
13, 7. 

181 One does not cut off a sick limb, but nurses and 
heals it, and Paul says that the most dishonest members 
should be given the most honor [1 Cor. 13:23]. But 
nature is so blinded and corrupted by the poison of the 
devil, that even if the children of this world know that 
someone is gifted with many excellent gifts and virtues, 
still, when they perceive even one spot or blemish in him, 
they look at it alone, forgetting all his gifts and the good 
he has in himself. You will also find many such inhuman, 
bitter scoffers, 


who do not call those whom they wish ill by their proper 
name, but identify them by a vituperative paraphrase, 
like the one in Terence: He with the squinting eyes, he 
with the hawk nose, he with the face full of freckles 2c. 
In short, the world is the devil's kingdom, which most 
certainly despises faith and love and everything that God 
says and does. 

So Paul commends love to the Galatians and to all 
the godly (for these alone love), and exhorts them that 
by it they may serve one another, as if to say, "There is 
no need to burden yourselves with circumcision and the 
Mosaic customs (ritibus), but first of all persevere in the 
doctrine of faith which you have received from me. After 
this, if ye will do good works, | will show you in one word 
the highest and greatest works, and how ye may fulfill all 
the laws: Love one another with right love (per 


caritatem). You will not lack people whom you can help, 
for the world is full of people who need the help of others. 

This is the perfect doctrine of faith and love and the 
shortest and longest theology. The shortest in terms of 


words and sentences (sententias), but in terms of custom 
and the thing itself, it is broader, longer, deeper and 
higher than the whole world. 


V. 15 But if you bite and devour one another, see 
to it that you are not consumed one by one. 


With these words Paul testifies that peace and 
harmony cannot exist in the churches, neither in doctrine 
nor in life, if the foundation is overthrown by ungodly 
teachers, that is, the faith in Christ, but that other and 
again other opinions and divisions arise concerning 
doctrine and life. But once the unity of a congregation is 
disturbed, there is no end to discord. For since the 
authors of the divisions (schismatum) disagree among 
themselves, one teaches this work and the other that it 
is necessary for salvation. Each holds his own opinion 
and superstition to be good and wrong. 


672 Li. ttai. Ill, 1-4. Explanation of Galatians 5, 15, W. VIII, 


throws those of the other. Inevitably, then, discord and 
mobs must arise. That is why they bite and devour each 
other, that is, judge and condemn each other, until they 
finally perish. 

This is attested not only by the Scriptures, but also 
by the examples of all times. When Africa was turned by 
the Manichaeans, they were soon followed by the 
Donatists, who, also divided among themselves, were 
divided into three sects 2c. In our time, first the 
Sacramentarians fell away, then the Anabaptists, both of 
whom are not united among themselves. Thus one sect 
always gives birth to another, and one condemns the 


other. When the unity (unitate) ceases, the number, as 
the mathematicians say, goes to infinity. In the same 
way, when the unity of the spirit has been violated or 
destroyed, it is not possible for unity to remain in doctrine 
and in life, but errors continue to arise on both sides ad 
infinitum. 

We have seen this also in the papacy, in which, since 
the doctrine of faith lay neglected, it was impossible for 
unity of spirit to remain. When this was gone, the doctrine 
of works gave rise to almost innumerable sects of 
monks. Those who disagreed among themselves 
measured holiness according to the hardness of the 
orders and the difficulty of the superstitious works they 
themselves had devised. Therefore, some wanted to be 
considered holier than others. Similarly, not only the 
monks of different orders, but also those who belonged 


to the same order (professionis) were at odds among 
themselves; as one potter hated another, so one 


barefoot (Minorita) hated another 2c. Finally, in each 
monastery there were as many different opinions as 
there were monks. So long they had envy, discord, strife, 
poisonous behavior, biting and eating among 
themselves, until, as Paul says here, they have now 
been consumed 2c. 

But those who hold to the doctrine of faith and love 
one another according to this commandment of Paul do 
not blame one another's status and works, but each 
approves of the other's status and the service he 
performs in his profession. No godly person prefers 
before God the office of the 





2701-2704. 673 


He does not distinguish between the position (officio) of 
a subordinate, because he knows that both are God's 
order and have God's command. He makes no 
distinction between the position or work of a father and 
a son, a schoolteacher and a pupil, a master and a 
servant, but confesses that both are pleasing to God if 
they are done in faith and obedience to God. It is true 
that in the eyes of the world these ranks and their offices 
are unequal, but this outward inequality does not hinder 
the unity of the Spirit, by which all have the same opinion 
and the same faith in Christ, namely, that through him 
alone we are granted forgiveness of sins and 
righteousness. Then, as regards outward conduct and 
ministry, one does not judge another, nor reprove his 
works, nor praise his own, though they far surpass them, 
but they confess with one mouth and in one spirit that 
they have the same Christ as Savior, in whom is no 
respect of person or works 2c. 

It is impossible for those who neglect the doctrine of 
faith and charity and teach superstitious works to do so. 
A monk does not admit to a layman that the works he 
does in his profession are as good and as pleasing to 
God as his own. A nun prefers her status and works to 
the status and works of a respectable woman who has a 
husband. She judges that her works are meritorious and 
serve to obtain grace and eternal life, but a wife does not 
perform such works. And hence it is that these unholy 


people, as avarice is wont to adorn itself (ut auri fames), 
have fiercely insisted and also persuaded the whole 
world that their status and works are far greater and 
holier than the status and works of the laity, and if they 
did not still have and defend this delusion of the holiness 
of their works among some people today, they would not 
long retain their prestige (dignitatem) and their wealth. 
Therefore, you will not be able to persuade any monk or 
any other saint of works, whoever he may be, that the 
works of a husband, a wife, a servant, a 


674 Li. kai. 1, 4-6. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2704-2707. 


675 





Maid 2c. that are done in faith and obedience to God are 
better and more pleasing to God than those superstitious 
and strange works of their own choosing that they do. 
For if the cornerstone Christ is rejected, the builders 
cannot judge otherwise than that they alone are pleasing 
to God, especially since they do such excellent and great 
works. So today the Anabaptists dream that they who 
suffer poverty, hunger, cold and wear little clothing 2c. 
are holy, but others who have property 2c. are not 
equally. Therefore, it is impossible for the works saints 
and the originators of sects to be at peace with those who 
do not agree with their opinion, but bite and devour them. 
Paul, on the other hand, teaches that such occasions 
of discord must be avoided and shows how they can be 
avoided. This, he says, is the way to harmony. Let each 
one do his duty in the position to which God has called 
him. He does not exalt himself above others, does not 
reproach the works of others, and does not praise his 
own as if they were better, but through love one serves 
the other. This is the right and simple doctrine of good 
works. 
(190) This is not done by those who have been 
shipwrecked in the faith, and have imbibed enthusiastic 
opinions about faith and life or good works, but 
immediately disagree among themselves about the 
doctrine of faith and good works, and bite and devour 
one another, that is, they make accusations and 
condemn, as Paul says here of the Galatians: "But if you 
bite one another," 2c. as if he wanted to say: Do not 
accuse and condemn one another for circumcision, for 
keeping holidays, or for other ceremonies, but rather 
judge that you serve one another through love. 
Otherwise, if you continue to bite and devour one 
another, see to it that you are not consumed, that is, that 
you perish completely in body. This almost always 
happens, especially with the founders of sects, as with 
Arius and others, and in our time with some. For he who 
lays the foundation on the sand and builds wood, hay 
and stubble on it must inevitably perish and be burned. 
For 


All this is ready for the fire, not to mention that such bites 
and devours are also followed by devastation, not only of 
a city but of whole countries and kingdoms 2c. Now he 
explains what it means to serve one's neighbor through 
love. 

It is difficult and dangerous to teach that we are 
justified by faith without works, and yet to require works 
at the same time. If here the servants of Christ and 
stewards of God's mysteries, who rightly divide the word 
of truth, are not faithful and wise, then faith and works are 
immediately mixed together. Each of these two articles, 
both of faith and of works, must be carefully taught and 
inculcated, but in such a way that each remains within its 
proper limits. Otherwise, if works alone are taught, as 
happens in the papacy, faith is lost. When faith alone is 
taught, carnal men soon dream that works are not 
necessary 2c. 

192 The apostle had begun above [v. 14] to exhort to 
good works and to say that all laws are fulfilled in one 
word, namely in this: "Love your neighbor as yourself. 
Here it might occur to someone: Paul in the whole epistle 
denies righteousness to the law, because he says: "By 
the works of the law no flesh is justified" [Cap. 2, 16.]; 
likewise [Cap. 3, 10.]: "Those who deal in the works of the 
law are under the curse" 2c. But now, since he says that 
all the laws are fulfilled in One Word, he seems to have 
forgotten the matter which he treated in this whole epistle, 
and to have come to an entirely different opinion, namely, 
this, that those who do the works of love fulfill the law and 
are righteous. To this objection he answers with these 
words: 


V. 16 But I say, walk in the Spirit. 


193 As if to say: | have not forgotten my previous 


discussion (disputationis) of faith, nor do | now revoke it, 
since | exhort you to love one another and say that all laws 
are fulfilled through love, but am completely of the same 
opinion as before. Therefore | add, so that you may 
understand me correctly: "Walk in the Spirit" 2c.

677 








Refutation of the Sophists' reason for proof: 
Love is the fulfillment of the law, therefore the 
law justifies. 


194 Although Paul has spoken here actually and 
clearly, it has not been of any use. For the sophists drew 
this conclusion from Paul's saying [Rom. 13:10]: "Love 
is the fulfillment of the law," which they did not 
understand correctly: If love is the fulfillment of the law, 
then love is righteousness, so we are righteous when 
we love. These lovely people infer from the word to the 
work, from the teaching or the commandments to the life 
in this way: The law commands love, so it immediately 
follows that it is also put into practice. It is an extremely 
inconsistent conclusion if someone wants to prove the 
works from commandments and conclude the works. 

We should fulfill the law and be justified by its 
fulfillment, but sin stands in the way. The Law prescribes 
and commands that we should love GOD with all our 
heart 2c. and our neighbor as ourselves, but therefore it 
does not follow: This is written, therefore it is done; the 
Law commands love, therefore we love. You cannot 
muster a man in all the earth who will love GOtt and 
neighbor as the Law demands. In the life to come, when 
we will be completely cleansed from all infirmities and 
sins and be pure as the sun, we will love perfectly and 
be righteous through perfect love. In this life, however, 
the flesh prevents this purity, since as long as we live, 
sin still clings to it. Therefore, sinful self-love is so 
powerful that it is far stronger than love against GOD 
and against the neighbor. But in the meantime, so that 
we may be righteous even in this life, we have the mercy 
seat and throne of grace, Christ; if we believe in Him, sin 
will not be imputed to us. So faith is our righteousness 
in this life. But in the life to come, when we will be 
thoroughly pure and completely free from all sins and 
evil lusts, we will no longer need faith and hope, but will 
love perfectly. 

196. that is why it is a great mistake that 





Justification is attributed to love, which is nothing, or if it 
is something, it is not so great as to reconcile God, 
because even the saints, as | have said, love imperfectly 
and not purely in this life. However, nothing impure will 
enter the Kingdom of Heaven. But in the meantime we 
are kept upright by this confidence that Christ, who alone 
has done no sin, and in whose mouth no deceit has been 
found, overshadows us with his righteousness. By this 
screen, the heaven of forgiveness of sins and throne of 
grace, covered and protected, we begin to love and fulfill 
the law. But because of this fulfillment we are not 
justified, nor are we therefore pleasing before God, as 
long as we live here. But when Christ shall have 
delivered the kingdom to the Father, and all dominion 2c. 
shall be done, and GOD shall be all in all, then faith and 
hope shall cease, and love shall be perfect and 
everlasting, 1 Cor. 13, 8. This the sophists do not 
understand. Therefore, when they hear that love is the 
summa of the law, they immediately conclude: Therefore 
love justifies. Or again, when they read in Paul's writings 
that faith justifies, they add: namely, faith that has 
received its right form through love. This is not the 
opinion of Paul, as has been said above in detail. 

If we were pure from all sins and completely on fire 
with love for God and neighbor, then we would surely be 
righteous and holy through love, and there would be 
nothing else that God could require of us. This does not 
happen in the present life, but is postponed until the 
future. We do receive the gift and the firstfruits of the 
Spirit here, that we begin to love, but very weakly. But if 
we loved God rightly and completely, as the law [Deut. 
6, 5] demands: "You shall love the Lord your God with 
all your heart" 2c., then lack would be as pleasant to us 
as riches, pain as pleasure, death as life 2c. Yes, one 
who loved God rightly and perfectly could not live long, 
but would soon be consumed by love.

679 





But now human nature is so corrupt and drowned in 
sins that it can think nothing right of God or have a right 
opinion of Him; it does not love God, but hates Him very 
much. 2c. Therefore, "we," as John [1 Ep. 4, 10.] says, 
"have not loved GOD, but He has loved us, and sent His 
Son to be the propitiation for our sins"; and above Cap. 
2, 20. [Paul says], "Christ loved me, and gave himself for 
me"; and Cap. 4, 4. 5. "God sent His Son, put under the 
law, that He might redeem the" 2c. Redeemed and 
justified by this Son, we begin to love, as Paul says in 
Rom. 8, 3, 4: "That which was impossible for the law" 2c., 
"that righteousness, required by the law, might be 
fulfilled in us," that is, begin to be fulfilled. Therefore, 
what the Sophists taught about the fulfillment of the law 
is nothing but dreams. 

For this reason Paul indicates with these words: 
"Walk in the Spirit" 2c. how he wants his statement to be 
understood, since he had said: "Through love serve one 
another"; likewise: love is the fulfillment of the law 2c. as 
if he wanted to say: Since | command you to love one 
another, | require this of you, that ye walk in the Spirit. 
For | know that you will not fulfill the law. Because sin 
clings to you as long as you live, it is impossible for you 
to fulfill the law. But in the meantime, be diligent to walk 
in the spirit, that is, to fight in the spirit against the flesh, 
and to follow what the spirit impels you to do 2c. 

200 So he has not forgotten the matter of justification. 
For since he calls them walking in the Spirit, he evidently 
denies that works justify, as if to say: When | speak of 
the fulfillment of the law, it is not my opinion that you are 
justified by the law, but | say this, that there are two 
different guides in you, which are contrary to one 
another, the spirit and the flesh. God has stirred up strife 
and battle in your body, for the spirit fights with the flesh, 
and again, the flesh with the spirit. Here | ask nothing 
more of you, for you can do no more than follow the spirit 
as your leader and resist the other leader, the flesh. 
Follow the one, against 





fight against this. Therefore, when | teach the law and 
exhort you to love one another, do not think that | am 
revoking the doctrine of faith and now ascribing 
justification to the law or to love, but this | want you to do, 
that you may walk in the spirit, so that you may not carry 
out the lusts of the flesh. 

But Paul actually uses taken words as if he wanted 
to say: We have not yet come to fulfill the law, therefore 
we must walk in the Spirit and exercise ourselves to 
think, speak and do the things of the Spirit, and to resist 
the things of the flesh. Therefore he adds: 


Thus you will not accomplish the lusts of the flesh. 


As if he wanted to say: The desires of the flesh are 
not yet dead, but sprout up again and again, grumbling 
and fighting against the spirit. The flesh of no saint is so 
good that, when it has been offended, it would not gladly 
bite and devour, or at least let something of the 
commandment of love stand in the way. Indeed, in the 
first impetuosity it cannot refrain from turning away from 
its neighbor, desiring revenge and hating him as an 
enemy, or at least loving him less than it should 
according to this commandment. This happens to the 
saints. 

This is why the apostle established this rule for the 
saints, that they should serve one another through love, 
that they should bear one another's weakness and 
burden, that they should forgive one another's faults, and 
without this gentleness it is impossible for peace and 
harmony to exist among Christians. For it is impossible 
that you should not often be offended, and in turn, offend 
others. You see in me many things that annoy you, and | 
in turn see in you many things that displease me. If here 
one does not give way to the other through love, there 


will be no end to strife, discord, envy (aemulationum), 
enmity 2c. 

204. Therefore Paul wants us to walk in the Spirit, so 
that we do not carry out the lusts of the flesh, as if to say: 
Although you should be moved by anger, envy 2c. 


680 2ri. 6ai. Ill, 11-13. Explanation of Galatians 5, 16, W. VIII, 2713-2716. 


681 





against a brother who should offend you or do something 
in a hostile way against you, nevertheless resist through 
the spirit and do not leave room for these impulses; bear 
his weakness and love him, as this word prescribes: 
"Love your neighbor as yourself. For the brother does 
not cease to be your neighbor because he falls into a 
trap or offends you, but then he has the greatest need of 
you to love him. And this commandment, "Love thy 
neighbor," 2c. demands the same thing, namely, that 
thou obey not the flesh, which, when it has been 
offended, hates, bites, devours, 2c., but fight against it in 
the spirit, and persevere through the spirit in love toward 
thy neighbor, even if thou shouldest find nothing in him 
worthy of love. 

The Sophists interpret "the lusts of the flesh" as 
unchastity. It is true that even the godly, especially young 
people, are challenged by unchastity; indeed, married 
couples (so corrupt and poisoned is the flesh) are not 
without unchastity. Now let each one (I am speaking now 
to godly husbands and wives of both sexes) carefully 
examine himself, then he will undoubtedly find that he 
likes the attitudes or manners of another's wife more 
than his own (and again). The woman to whom he has a 
right he is weary of, the woman who is denied him he 
loves. Yes, this tends to happen in all things: what 
someone has, he despises; what he does not have, he 
loves. We love what is forbidden and always desire what 
is denied 2c. 

Therefore | do not deny that the lusts of the flesh also 
include unchastity, but not only because they include all 
the sinful inclinations with which the godly are 
challenged, some more, others less, as there are pride, 
hatred, avarice, impatience, unchastity 2c. Yes, Paul 
then includes among the works of the flesh not only 
those gross sins, but also idolatry, heresy 2c. It is 
therefore evident that he is speaking of all the lusts of 
the flesh and of the whole realm of sin, which is in the 
godly, who are the first to be sinned against. 


1) We have adopted lohnor with the Wittenberg edition and Menius 
instead of lo“iiur in the Jena and in the Erlangen. 





The one who has received the spirit is fighting against 
the kingdom of the spirit. So he does not only speak of 
unchastity, hopefulness 2c., but also of unbelief, distrust, 
despair, hatred, contempt of God, idolatry, heresies 2c., 
because he says: "Thus you will not fulfill the lusts of the 
flesh. As if to say, | write unto you to love one another; 
which ye do not, neither can ye do, because ye have the 
flesh, and that which is corrupted by the evil lust, which 
not only maketh sin in you, but is the very chief sin. 
Otherwise, if you had perfect love, no sadness, no 
misfortune could be so great that it could disturb this 
love, because it would be spread through the whole 
body. No wife would be so ugly that her husband should 
not love her fiercely and spurn all other wives, however 
beautiful they might be 2c. This does not happen. 
Therefore, it is impossible that you should be justified by 
love. 

(207) Therefore, do not think that | am revoking the 
doctrine of faith. For faith and hope must remain, so that 
through faith we may be justified, and through hope we 
may be raised up in adversity and remain steadfast. 
Then we serve one another through love, because faith 
is not idle, but love is small and weak. Therefore, when | 
tell you to walk in the Spirit, | am making it sufficiently 
clear that you will not be justified by love. 

208. And in saying that you should walk in the spirit, 
so that you do not obey the flesh, or so that you do not 
carry out the lusts of the flesh, | do not require of you that 
you completely strip off or kill the flesh, but that you keep 
it in check. For God wants the human race to last until 
the last day. This cannot happen without parents who 
beget and raise children. Where these means remain, 
the flesh must also remain and consequently sin, 
because the flesh is not without sin. 

Therefore, if we look to the flesh, we are sinners; if to 
the Spirit, we are righteous, and so we are partly sinners, 


682 ar: 6ai. , 13.18. Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vu, 2716-2719. 


righteousness in part. But our righteousness is greater 
than sin, because the holiness and righteousness of 
Christ our Reconciler is far greater than the sin of the 
whole world, and the forgiveness of sins that we have 
through Him is so great, rich and infinite that it easily 
consumes all sins if we only walk in the Spirit 2c. 

It should also be noted that Paul does not write this 
only to the hermits and monks who live celibate, but to 
all Christians. This | say, lest we be deceived with the 
papists, who have dreamed that this commandment 


concerns only the clerics, whom the apostle exhorts to 
walk in the spirit, that is, to tame and subdue the flesh 
by watching, fasting, working, 2c.., and live chastely, 
then they would not accomplish the lusts of the flesh, 
that is, unchastity; as if all lust of the flesh were thereby 
overcome, if unchastity were subdued and suppressed, 
which alone they could not suppress by any subjugation 
of the flesh. 

This is what Jerome freely confesses, not to mention 
others, who was an extraordinary lover and defender of 
chastity. O how often, he says, when | was in the desert 
and in that vast wasteland, which, burned by the heat of 
the sun, gives the monks an uncanny dwelling, | thought 
that | was with the Roman delights 2c. Likewise: |, who 
for fear of hell had condemned myself to such a prison, 
who was only in the company of scorpions and wild 
animals, was often present [in my dreams] 1) at the 
round dances of the young girls. The face was pale from 
fasting and the mind burned with lusts in a cold body, 
and while the flesh alone had died sooner than the man 
to whom it belonged, the conflagrations of the pleasure 
2c. If Jerome felt such great ardor of unchastity, feeding 
on water and bread in the desert, what do you think our 


clergy will feel, the servants (cultores) of the holy belly, 
who so fill and expand themselves with delicious 
morsels, 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. VII, 1838 f., § 126. 


683 


that it is surprising that they do not burst in two in the 
middle. 

Therefore, this is written not only to the monks, nor 
to the sinners of the world, but to the whole Christian 
Church and to all the godly, whom Paul exhorts to walk 
in the spirit, so that they do not carry out the lusts of the 
flesh, that is, that they not only restrain the gross 
impulses of the flesh, unchastity, anger, impatience 2c. 
but also the spiritual ones, such as doubt, blasphemy, 
idolatry, contempt and hatred of God 2c. 

Also, as | have said, Paul does not require the godly 
to completely cut off and destroy their flesh, but to keep 
it in check so that it may be subject to the spirit. Rom. 
13, 14. He commands us to wait for the body. For just 
as we must not be cruel to the bodies of others, nor 
afflict them with excessive labor, so also we must not be 
cruel to our own bodies. Therefore, according to Paul's 
commandment, we must care for our bodies, that they 
may bear the labors of the spirit and of the body; but only 
for necessity; not for the nourishment of evil desire, he 
would have us care for his. Therefore, when the flesh 
begins to get horny, restrain it by the spirit. If it persists, 
go into matrimony, for it is better to be free than to suffer 
heat. When you do this, you are walking in the spirit, that 
is, you are following the word of God and doing His will. 

By the way, as | have said, this commandment to 
walk in the spirit 2c. concerns not only the hermits and 
monks, but all the godly, even though they do not live in 
unchastity. A prince does not commit the lusts of the 
flesh when he carefully executes his office, when he 
presides well over his subjects, punishes the guilty and 
protects the innocent. Against this the flesh and the devil 
argue and provoke him to start an unjust war, to obey 
fine lusts 2c. If he does not follow the spirit as a fine 
guide and the word of God, which reminds him of his 
duty in a right and Christian way, then he fulfills the lusts 
of the flesh. So let each one walk in a fine profession in 
the spirit, and not only not perform unchastity, but also 
other works of the flesh. 


684 ii. kai. 1, 16-18. Explanation of Galatians 5, 17, w. vn, 2719-2722. 


V. 17 For the flesh lusts against the 
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. 


When Paul says that the flesh lusts against the Spirit, 
and the Spirit against the flesh, he reminds us that we 
would feel the lusts of the flesh, that is, not only 
unchastity, but also hopefulness, anger, sadness, 
impatience, unbelief. 2c. But he wants us to feel them in 
such a way that we do not give our consent to them or 
carry them out, that is, that we should not think, speak 
and do what the flesh puts us up to and what it provokes 
us to do, but if it moves us to anger, we should still be 
angry, as the 4th Psalm, v. 5, teaches, so that we do not 
sin, as if Paul wanted to say this: | know that ye shall be 
provoked of the flesh to anger, envy, doubt, unbelief 2c. 
but resist it in the spirit, that ye sin not. But if you leave 
the Spirit as your guide and follow the flesh, you will fulfill 
the lusts of the flesh and die, Rom. 8:13. So this saying 
is not to be understood of unchastity alone, but of the 
whole realm of sin 2c. 


These are against each other, that you do not do 
what you want. 


These two leaders, he says, in your body, the flesh 
and the spirit, are against each other, so that you do not 
do what you want. These words | understand to be said 


of the faculty (potentialiter), that is, that you cannot do 
what you will. And this passage clearly testifies that Paul 
writes this for the saints, that is, for the church that 
believes in Christ, that is baptized, justified, 
regenerated, and has perfect forgiveness of sins, and 
yet he says that it has flesh that contends against the 
Spirit. In the same way he speaks of himself Rom. 7, 14: 
"lam carnal, sold under sin"; and then v. 23: "I see 
another law in my members, which is contrary to the law 
in my mind" 2c.; likewise v. 24: "| wretched man" 2c. 
217 Here not only the sophists are anxiously struggling, 
but also some of the fathers, how they would excuse 
Paul. For they consider it shameful that 





685 


It is said that this chosen armor of Christ should have 
sin. We believe the words of Paul, in which he openly 
confesses that he is sold under sin, that he is taken 
captive by sin, that he has a law that contends against 
him, that he serves the law of sin according to the flesh. 
Here again they answer that the apostle speaks this in 
the person of the ungodly. The ungodly do not complain 


about the opposition (rebellione), the struggle and the 
captivity of sin, because sin reigns powerfully in them. 
Therefore, this complaint is quite actually that of Paul 
and all the saints 2c. 

Therefore, those who excused Paul and other saints 
and said that they had no sin, not only acted unwise but 


also ungodly. For with this pretense (persuasione), which 
arose from ignorance of the doctrine of faith, they 
deprived the church of the greatest comfort, eliminated 
the forgiveness of sins, and made Christ superfluous 
(otiosum). 

Therefore Paul does not deny that he has flesh and 
the infirmities of the flesh, since he says: "| see another 
law in my members" 2c. Therefore, it is believable that 
at times he felt heat, but | believe that it was well 
suppressed by the heavy and great spiritual and bodily 
temptations with which, as his letters indicate, he was 
almost constantly afflicted and plagued, or even if at 
times, when he was joyful and strong, he felt heat, 
anger, impatience 2c., he nevertheless resisted in spirit 
and did not allow those impulses to rule over him. 
Therefore we do not have to suffer in any way that such 
passages, which are very full of consolation, in which 
Paul describes the struggle of the flesh against the spirit 
in his own body, are perverted with such inconsistent 
glosses. The Sophists and the monks did not experience 
spiritual trials, therefore they only made war with 
unchastity in order to suppress and overcome it, and 
puffed up by this victory, which, however, they never 
achieved, they thought that they were far better and 
holier than married couples, not to say, however, that 
under this pretense, which is a beautiful

They have committed and confirmed all kinds of 


abominable sins (confirmaverint), disunity, arrogance, 
hatred, contempt for their neighbor, trust in their own 
righteousness, presumption, neglect of godliness and 
the word of God, unbelief, blasphemy 2c. They did not 
fight against these sins, they did not even consider them 
sins, but thought that only that was righteousness if they 
kept their foolish and ungodly vows, but sin if they did 
not keep them. 

But we must certainly believe that our primary, 


complete (rotundam) and perfect righteousness is 
Christ. If there is nothing on which we can base 
ourselves, there remain, as Paul says, these three: faith, 
hope and love. So one must always believe and hope, 
always take hold of Christ as the head and source of our 
righteousness. Whoever believes in him will not be put 
to shame. Then we must make every effort to be 
outwardly righteous, that is, not to give in to the flesh, 
which always brings evil, but to resist it through the spirit, 
not to grow weary because of the ingratitude and 
contempt of the great multitude who abuse Christian 
liberty, but to overcome in the spirit these and all other 
temptations. Thus, as far as we fight against the flesh in 
the spirit, we are also outwardly righteous, although this 
righteousness does not make us pleasing before God. 

Let no one therefore despair when he feels that the 
flesh is continually stirring up new warfare against the 
spirit, or when he cannot immediately force the flesh to 
be subject to the spirit. |, too, wish that | had a firmer and 
more constant courage, which could not only freshly 
despise the threats of tyrants, the heresies that the 
spirits sow, and the agitations and turmoil that they 
arouse, but which could also immediately shake off the 
fear and anguish of the heart, which finally would not 
shun even bitter death, but would receive it as the most 
pleasant guest. But | find another law in my members, 
which contradicts the law in my heart. 





Mind 2c. Others have to struggle with lesser 
temptations, such as poverty, shame, impatience 2c. 
Therefore, let no one be surprised or frightened when he 
feels in his body this struggle of the flesh against the 
spirit, but let him be uplifted by these words of Paul: "The 
flesh lusts against the spirit," and likewise: "These are 
contrary to one another, that ye do not do according to 
your will. For with these sayings he comforts the 
challenged, as if to say, "It is impossible that you should 
follow the Spirit as your guide in all things without feeling 
the flesh and being hindered by it. Yes, the flesh will 
resist, and resist in such a way that you will not be able 
to do what you would like to do. Here it is enough that 
you resist the flesh, that you do not carry out its lusts, 
that is, that you follow the spirit, not the flesh, which 
easily becomes impatient, desires revenge, bites, 
doubts, grumbles, hates God, is angry with Him, 
despairs 2c. Therefore, when someone feels this 
struggle of the flesh, he should not lose heart, but resist 
in spirit and say: | am a sinner and feel sin, because | 
have not yet been stripped of the flesh, to which sin 
clings as long as it lives. But | will obey the spirit, not the 
flesh, that is, | will take hold of Christ by faith and hope, 
and | will build myself up by his word, and when | am 
thus built up, | will not accomplish the lusts of the flesh. 

It is of great benefit to the godly to know and consider 
this teaching of Paul, for it is of great comfort to those 
who are troubled. As | was a monk, | thought that if | felt 
any lust of the flesh, that is, any evil impulse, unchastity, 
anger, hatred, envy, 2c. against any brother, it would 
immediately destroy my blessedness. | tried many 
things, | confessed daily 2c., but | achieved nothing. For 
the lust of the flesh always returned, so | could not be 
satisfied, but was constantly tormented by these 
thoughts: You have committed this and that sin, likewise, 
you have been guilty of envy, impatience 2c. Therefore 


688 Li. Kai. ll, 20-23. Explanation of the Epistle to the Galatians 5, 17, w. vill, 2724-2727. 


689 





you have entered the holy order in vain and all your good 
works are useless. If | had rightly understood Paul's 
sayings at that time: "The flesh lusts against the Spirit" 
2c. "The same are contrary to one another" 2c., | would 
not have martyred myself in this way, but would have 
thought, as | am wont to do nowadays: Martin, you 
cannot be entirely without sin, because you still have the 
flesh in you, you will therefore feel its struggle, as Paul 
says: "The flesh strives against the Spirit." Therefore, do 
not despair, but fight against it so that you do not fulfill its 
lusts, and then you will not be under the law. 

'l remember that Staupitz used to say: | have vowed 
to God more than a thousand times that | want to 
become more righteous, but | have never carried out 
what | vowed. Furthermore, | do not want to vow such 
things anymore, because | have now learned from 
experience that | cannot do it. Therefore, if God is not 
reconciled and merciful to me for Christ's sake, and will 
grant me a desired and blessed hour when | must depart 
from this miserable life, | will not be able to stand with my 
vows and what | have done well. 

This was not only a true, but also a Christian and holy 
despair, which all those who want to be saved must 
confess with heart and mouth. For the saints do not base 
themselves on their righteousness, but cry out with 
David [Ps. 143:2], "O Lord, enter not into judgment with 
thy servant, for before thee no living man is righteous"; 
likewise [Ps. 130:3], "If thou wilt, O Lord, impute sin, O 
Lord, who shall stand?" But they look upon Christ their 
propitiator, who gave his life for their sins. Then, what sin 
is left in the flesh, they know that it will not be imputed to 
them, but forgiven them through the forgiveness of sins. 
But in the meantime they fight in the spirit against the 
flesh, not that they should not feel its pleasure at all, but 
that they should not accomplish it. Therefore, although 
they feel that 


1) The same narrative is found in § 5 of the 18th chapter of the Table 
Talks and in § 42 of the 14th chapter. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. 
XXII, 560 f. and Col. 507. 


If the flesh rages and rebels against the Spirit, and if they 
sometimes fall into sin through weakness, they do not 
lose heart because of this, nor do they immediately think 
that their position and office and the works they do in 
their profession are displeasing to God, but they 
straighten themselves up through faith. 

(225) So believers have great comfort from this 
teaching of Paul, that they know that they are partly of 
the flesh and partly of the Spirit, but in such a way that 
the Spirit rules, the flesh is subdued, righteousness 
rules, and sin serves. Therefore, whoever does not know 
this doctrine, and thinks that the godly must be 
completely without all lack, and yet feels the opposite, is 
finally consumed by the spirit of sadness and despairs. 
But whoever knows this teaching and uses it rightly, 
even evil will serve him for the best. For if the flesh 
tempts him to sin, he is provoked and urged by this 
occasion to seek forgiveness of sins through Christ, to 
take hold of the righteousness of faith, which otherwise 
he would not esteem so highly, nor long for with so great 
a desire. 

Therefore it is very useful that we sometimes feel the 
wickedness of our nature and our flesh, so that we may 
be encouraged and provoked to faith and to call upon 
Christ, and on that occasion the Christian becomes a 
mighty artist and a wonderful creator, who can turn 
sorrow into joy, terror into consolation, sin into 
righteousness, death into life, thus keeping the flesh in 
check, subduing it and subjecting it to the spirit. 

Therefore, those who feel the lusts of the flesh should 
not immediately despair of their blessedness. They may 
still feel them, but they must not consent to them; they 
may still be moved by anger, unchastity, 2c., but they 
must not be governed by them; they may be provoked 
by sin, but they must not accomplish it. Yes, the more 
godly someone is, the more he feels this struggle. Hence 
the great lamentations of the saints in the Psalms and in 
all the Scriptures. The hermits, the monks, the sophists 
and all the saints of works know nothing at all about this 
struggle. 


690 1. “Li. 1, 23-25. interpretations On the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2727-2730. 


But here someone would say that it is dangerous to 
teach this, that someone would not be condemned if he 
does not immediately overcome the temptations of the 
flesh, which he feels, because if this teaching were to 
be spread among the people, they would become safe, 
lazy and inactive 2c. This is what | said above, if we 
teach faith, carnal people neglect works; if works are 
taught, faith and the consolation of consciences are lost. 
Here no one can be forced, nor can a certain rule be 
prescribed, but let each one carefully examine himself 
to see by what temptation of the flesh he is chiefly 
afflicted, and where he finds it out, do not be sure, do 
not flatter yourself, but be watchful and fight against it 
by the spirit, so that, even if he cannot completely 
suppress it, at least he will not accomplish it. 

229 All the saints have had and felt this struggle of 
the flesh with the spirit, and we also experience it. 
Whoever examines his conscience, if he is not a 
hypocrite, will surely find that it is as Paul describes 
here, namely, that the flesh lusts against the spirit. 
Therefore, every saint feels and confesses that his flesh 
is opposed to the spirit, and that these two are fighting 
against each other in him in such a way that he cannot 
do what he wants, no matter how hard he tries and 
exerts himself. Therefore, the flesh prevents us from 
keeping the commandments of God, from loving our 
neighbor as ourselves, much less from loving God with 
all our heart. 2c. Therefore, it is impossible for us to be 
justified by the works of the law. The good will is there, 
which must be there (for it is the spirit that contends 
against the flesh), which would like to do good, to fulfill 
the law, to love God and one's neighbor, but the flesh 
does not obey this will, but resists it. But God does not 
impute this sin, for He is gracious to believers for 
Christ's sake. 

However, it does not follow that you should disregard 
or despise sin because God does not impute it. He does 
not impute it, but to what people and why? Not the 
stubborn and secure, but 





691 


Those who repent and accept Christ, their reconciler, in 
faith, have all their sins forgiven and the remnants of sin 
not imputed to them. These do not make their sin small, 
but rather great, because they know that it cannot be 
blotted out by any atonement, by any works, or by any 
righteousness, except through the death of Christ. 
Nevertheless, they do not despair because of the 
greatness of their sin, but believe that it will be forgiven 
them for Christ's sake. 

| say this so that no one may think that sin, after one 
has come to faith, is not to be regarded as great. Sin is 
truly sin, whether it is committed before Christ is known 
or afterwards, and God always hates sin; indeed, every 
sin is a mortal sin as far as the essence of the act is 


concerned (quoad ad substantiam facti). But that it is not 
a mortal sin for the believer is because of the Atonement 
of Christ, who atoned for sin by His death. For the one 
who does not believe in Christ, not only are all sins mortal 
sins, but also his good works are sins, as it is written 
[Rom. 14:23.j: "Whatever does not come from faith is 
sin." 

232 Therefore this is a pernicious error of the 
sophists, who make a distinction between sins according 


to the essence of the act (penes substantiam facti), not 
according to the person. He who believes has the same 
sin and just as great a sin as an unbeliever, but it is 
forgiven and not imputed to the believer. But to the 
unbeliever it is retained and imputed. For the latter it is a 


sin that can be forgiven (venial), for the former it is a 
mortal sin, not because of the difference of sins, that the 
sin of the believer is less, that of the unbeliever greater, 
but because of the difference of persons. For the 
believer, through faith, certainly believes that his sin is 
forgiven him for Christ's sake, since he gave himself up 
for it. Therefore he remains godly even though he has sin 
and sins, whereas the unbeliever remains godless. And 
this is the wisdom and comfort of the true believer, that 
though they have and commit sins, yet they know that 
they are forgiven.

not be imputed to them because of their faith in Christ. 

| say this for the comfort of the godly. For these alone 
truly feel that they have and commit sins, that is, that 
they do not love God fervently enough, that they do not 
trust in Him from the heart, yes, that they continually 
doubt that He will take care of them, that they are 
impatient in their misfortune and are angry with God 2c. 
Hence come the great lamentations of the saints in 
Scripture, especially in the Psalms, and Paul complains 
that he is sold under sin, and here he says that the flesh 
resists the Spirit. But because (as he says elsewhere 
[Rom. 8, 13]) they kill business through the spirit of the 
flesh and (at the end of this chapter [v. 24]) crucify the 
flesh together with the lusts and desires, these sins do 
not harm them, nor do they condemn them. 

234 But if they obey the flesh to fulfill its lusts, they 
lose the faith and the Holy Spirit, and if they do not abhor 
sin and return to Christ, who gave the keys to the church 
to receive and restore fallen ones, and thus regain the 
faith and the Holy Spirit, they die in their sins. Therefore 
he does not speak of those who dream that they have 
faith, and yet live in sins. These have their judgment 
[Rom. 8:13], "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die," 
likewise [Gal. 5:19, 21], "manifest are the works of the 
flesh, fornication," 2c., "of which | have foretold you, and 
say yet before, that they which do these things shall not 
inherit the kingdom of God." 

From this it can also be understood which are the 
true saints. They are not lumps and stones, as the 
sophists and the monks dream, who are not moved by 
any thing at all, or never feel the lust of the flesh, but, as 
Paul says, "their flesh lusteth against the Spirit. 
Therefore they have sin and can sin, and the 32nd 
Psalm, v. 5. 6. testifies that the saints confess their 
unrighteousness and ask forgiveness for the iniquity of 
their sin, since it says: "I said: | will confess my 
transgression unto the Lord. Then you forgave 





me the iniquity of my sin. For this all the saints will ask 
you" 2c. Further, the whole Church, which is certainly 
holy, prays that her sins may be forgiven, and believes 
the forgiveness of sins, and in the 143rd Psalm, v. 2. 
David prays, "Go not into judgment with thy servant, for 
before thee no living man is righteous"; and Ps. 130:3, 
4. "If thou wilt, O Lord, impute sin, O Lord, who shall 
stand? For with thee is forgiveness" 2c. 

This is how the greatest saints speak and pray, 
David, Paul 2c. Thus all the saints speak and pray in the 
same spirit. The sophists do not read the Scriptures, or 
if they do read them, they read with a cover hung over 
their eyes; therefore they cannot judge rightly of any 
thing, neither of sin nor of holiness. 


V. 18 But if the Spirit governs you, you are not 
under the law. 


237 Paul cannot forget his doctrine of faith, but 
always repeats it and also inculcates it when he speaks 
of good works. Here someone would like to object: How 
can it be that we are not to be under the law? You, Paul, 
teach that we have flesh that lusts against the Spirit, 
which strives, afflicts and captivates us, 2c., and indeed 
we feel sin and cannot be free from this feeling, however 
much we may want to. That is certainly being under the 
law! Why then, dear Paul, do you say that we are not 
under the law? 

This, he says, should not move you, but only seek to 
be led by the Spirit, that is, to hold fast that will which is 
set against the flesh and does not carry out its lusts (for 
this is to be governed or drawn by the Spirit), then you 
are not under the law. Thus Paul speaks of himself Rom. 
7, 25: "With the mind | serve the law of God," that is, 
according to the spirit | am not subject to sin, "but with 
the flesh | serve the law of sin." Therefore, the godly are 
not under the law, that is, according to the spirit, 
because the law cannot accuse them and pronounce the 
sentence of death against them, 


694 [ri kai. u, 28-3". Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2733-2736. 


695 








although they themselves feel the sin and confess that 
they are sinners, because the law was deprived of its 
right by Christ, who was put under the law, so that he 
redeemed those who were under the law. Therefore, the 
law cannot accuse as sin what is in truth sin against the 
law in the case of the godly. So great, then, is the power 
of the rule of the Spirit that the law cannot accuse what 
is truly sin. For our righteousness, Christ, whom we take 
hold of in faith, is blameless, therefore the law cannot 
accuse him. As long as we cling to him, we are governed 
by the Spirit and are free from the law. So the apostle, 
even when he teaches good works, does not forget the 
trade of justification, but always indicates that it is 
impossible for us to be justified by works. For the 
remnants of sin still cling to the flesh, so as long as it 
lives it does not cease to lust against the Spirit. However, 
we run no danger, because we are free from the law, if 
we only walk in the spirit. 

239 And with these words, "But if the Spirit governs 
you, you are not under the law," you can gloriously 
comfort yourself and others who are suffering from 
severe temptations. For it often happens that a person is 
so strongly challenged by anger, hatred, impatience, 
unchastity, the spirit of sadness, or other lusts of the 
flesh that he cannot get rid of them completely, no matter 
how much he wishes to do so. What should he do here? 
Should he therefore deny? No, but he should say: Your 
flesh is now fighting and raging against the spirit. Let it 
rage as long as it wants. Only do not agree with it, but 
walk in the spirit and let it rule you, so that you do not 
carry out its lusts. If you do this, you are free from the 
law. It accuses and terrifies you, but in vain 2c. 
Therefore, in such a battle of the flesh against the spirit, 
nothing is better than to have the Word before thee, and 
from it to get comfort of the spirit. 

240 Neither should he who suffers this temptation be 
moved by the fact that the devil can make the sin so 
great that it seems to him that he must immediately, 
when this temptation comes upon him 


(in paroxysmo), completely succumb, and feel nothing 
but pure anger of God and despair. Here, however, let 
him not follow his feelings, but take this word of Paul: 
"But if the Spirit governs you," that is, if you align 
yourselves through faith in Christ, 2c., "you are not 
under the law." Thus he will have the most powerful 
protection with which to quench all the fiery darts with 
which that wicked one shoots at him. So, as much as the 
flesh may flare up and rage, all its impulses and rages 
cannot harm it nor condemn it, because, following the 
spirit as its guide, it does not give its consent to the flesh, 
nor does it carry out its lusts. 

Therefore, the only remedy is that when the impulses 
of the flesh rage within us, we take up the sword of the 
spirit, that is, the word of salvation, namely, that God 
does not want the death of the wicked, and fight against 
them, then we will undoubtedly be victorious, although 
as long as the battle lasts, we will feel completely the 
opposite. But if the word is put out of sight, then neither 
counsel nor help is 2c. | speak this as one who has 
experienced it. | have suffered many and many trials, 
and very severe ones at that. But as soon as | took hold 
of any word of Scripture and relied on it as a sacred 
anchor, the temptations soon lost their fierceness, which 
| could not possibly have endured for even a short time, 
much less overcome, without the Word. 

242 So this is the brief epitome of what Paul teaches 
in this discussion of the battle of the flesh and the Spirit, 
that the saints or believers cannot accomplish what the 
Spirit wants. For the Spirit would like to be completely 
pure, but the flesh, which is connected with it, does not 
allow it. Nevertheless, they are blessed through the 
forgiveness of sins that is in Christ. Then, because they 
also walk in the spirit and are governed by it, they are 
not under the law, that is, the law cannot accuse them 
and frighten them, or even if it does so, it cannot drive 
them into despair.

697 





V. 19. But the works of the flesh are evident, as 
they are 2c. 


This passage is not unlike the saying of Christ [Matth. 
7, 16. 17.]: "By their fruits you shall know them. Can you 
also gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? So 
every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt 
tree bringeth forth evil fruit. "2c. Paul teaches in this 
passage quite the same thing that Christ teaches there, 
namely, that the works and fruits sufficiently testify 
whether the trees feast well or evil, whether men follow 
the flesh or the Spirit as their guide, as if to say: Lest 
some of you pretend not to understand what | am about 
to say about the warfare of the flesh and of the Spirit, | 
will set before you first the works of the flesh, most of 
which are known even to the ungodly; then the fruits of 
the Spirit. 

244 And Paul does this because there were many 
hypocrites among the Galatians, as there are among us 
today, who claimed to be godly, boasted of the Spirit, 
and, as far as words were concerned, knew the doctrine 
of godliness well. Yet they did not walk in the Spirit, but 
in the flesh, performing the works of the same. And just 
by this Paul obviously convicts them that they were not 
the people they claimed to be, and so that they would 
not also despise this admonition of his, he passes a 
terrible judgment against them that they will not inherit 
the kingdom of God, so that they, reminded by this, 
would improve themselves. 

People of all ages, even among the godly, have their 
particular temptations; youthful age is mainly tempted by 
unchastity, male age by ambition and vain honor, and 
old age by avarice. Therefore | have said above that 
there never was a saint whom the flesh did not often 
provoke to impatience, anger 2c. in his life. Therefore 
Paul, speaking of the saints, says that in them the flesh 
lusted against the Spirit 2c. 

246 Therefore, the lusts and struggles of the flesh will 
not be lacking, but they do not immediately harm those 
who feel them. 





If one is tempted by the flesh and does not give room to 
the lusts of the flesh, but walks in the spirit and opposes 
it 2c., and something else if one agrees with the flesh 
and performs his works safely, continues in them, and 
yet pretends to be godly and boasts of the spirit 2c. The 
former he comforts by saying that they are governed by 
the spirit and are not under the law; the latter he 
threatens with eternal destruction. 

Yes, it sometimes happens that the saints fall and 
commit the lusts of the flesh, as David did a great and 
terrible fall, committing adultery, and also causing the 
murder of many, because he wanted Uriah to perish in 
battle, and thereby also gave the enemies an 
opportunity to boast against the people of God, to 
worship their idol, and to blaspheme the God of Israel. 
Peter also fell horribly by denying Christ. But however 
great these sins may be, they were not committed out of 
contempt for God or deliberate wickedness, but out of 
weakness. Then, too, when they were admonished, they 
did not stubbornly persist in their sins, but repented 2c. 
Of such he commands later, Cap. 6, 1, that they should 
be received, instructed and restored, saying: "If a man 
is overtaken by error" 2c. 

Therefore, grace is not denied to those who sin and 
fall out of weakness, if they only get up again and do not 
persist in their sins. But persisting in them is exceedingly 
evil 2c. 1) But if they do not repent, but continue to 
persist in the lusts of the flesh, it is a sure sign that their 
minds are full of falsehood. Therefore no one will be 
without lusts as long as he lives in the flesh, therefore 
no one will be without temptations. But one is 
challenged differently from the other, according to the 
difference of the persons. One is challenged by more 
important emotions, such as sadness of the spirit, 
blasphemy, misconduct, and the like.

698

another with greater sins, as unchastity, anger, hatred 
2c. But there Paul demands of us to walk in the spirit and 
resist the flesh. But he that obeys the flesh, and safely 
continues to perform his lusts, let him know that he is not 
Christ's, and however much he may adorn himself with 
the name of a Christian, yet he deceives himself. For 
"those who belong to Christ crucify their flesh along with 
their lusts and desires" (Gal. 5:24). 


What people are truly called and are holy. 


This passage, as | have also mentioned above, 
contains an extremely important consolation, because it 
reminds us that the saints cannot live without lusts and 
temptations of the flesh, and even without sins. It exhorts 
us, then, not to do as some of those of whom Gerson 
writes, who relied on the fact that they felt nothing at all 
of temptations and sins, that is, that they were entirely 
stones. The sophists and the monks had such a conceit 
of the saints, as if they were all sticks and blocks and 
completely without any emotions. Certainly, Mary felt 
great pain in her soul when she lost her son, Luc. 2, 35. 
David complains in the Psalms that he was almost 
consumed by the great sorrow that came over him 
because of the greatness of his temptations and sins. 
Paul also complains that he feels strife outwardly, fear 
inwardly [2 Cor. 7:5], that he serves the law of sin with 
the flesh [Rom. 7:25]; he says [2 Cor. 11:28] that he 
cares for all the churches, and [Phil. 2:27] that God had 
mercy on him, that he brought Epaphroditus, who was 
near death, back to life, so that he would not have one 
sorrow over another. Therefore, the saints of the 
Sophists are equal to the wives of the Stoics, who have 
invented such ways that have never existed in the whole 
world, and with this foolish and godless opinion, which 
arose from ignorance of this teaching of Paul, the 
Sophists have brought themselves and countless others 
to despair.

Since | was a monk, | often wished with all my heart 
that | would be fortunate enough to see the life of some 
holy man. But | dreamed of such a saint, who lived in the 
desert, abstained from food and drink, and lived only on 
the roots of herbs and cold water, and this delusion of 
such strange saints | had not only drawn from the books 
of the Sophists, but also from those of the Fathers. For 
somewhere St. Jerome writes: "But of food and drink | 
am silent, because it is more than enough that even the 
sick use cold water and take some cooked food 2c. 

But now that the sun of truth shines, we see clearly 
that Christ and the apostles call saints, not those who 
lead an unmarried life, abstain from wine, or do other 
seemingly conspicuous works, as one reads of many in 
the descriptions of the lives of the fathers, but those who 
are called and baptized by the gospel, and believe that 
they are sanctified and cleansed by Christ's death and 
blood. Thus, wherever Paul writes to Christians, he calls 
them saints, children and heirs of God 2c. Saints, then, 
are all who believe in Christ, however many they may 
be, whether men or women, servants or free 2c., not by 
their works, but by the works of God, which they receive 
through faith, such as: the Word, the sacraments, 
Christ's suffering, death, resurrection and victory, the 
sending of the Holy Spirit 2c. In short, they are saints by 


suffering, not by active holiness (sanctitate passiva, non 


activa). 

The ministers of the word, the worldly authorities, 
parents, children, masters, servants, 2c. are truly holy, if 
they first of all certainly believe that Christ is their 
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and salvation; 
then if each one does his duty in his profession 
according to the precepts of the word of God, not 
obeying the flesh, but subduing its desires and lusts 
through the Spirit. Now that not all are equally strong 1) 
but in most there are still many weaknesses

The fact that they are seen as evil and evil-doers does 
not hinder their holiness, if they sin not out of deliberate 
wickedness but out of weakness. For, as | have said 
several times, the godly feel the lusts of the flesh, but 
fight against them, so that they do not carry them out. 
Likewise, though they fall into sin unawares, they obtain 
forgiveness when they are raised up again through faith 
in Christ, who does not want us to cast them away, but 
to seek the lost sheep 2c. Far be it, therefore, that | 
should immediately judge those who are weak in faith or 
life to be godless people, when | see that they love and 
honor the Word and partake of the Lord's Supper 2c. 
For God has accepted these and counts them righteous 
through the forgiveness of sins. To Him they stand and 
fall 2c. 

Therefore, | thank God with joy that He has given me 
abundantly what | once asked for as a monk, that | have 
seen not one saint, but many, yes, countless true saints, 
not such as the sophists invent, but such as Christ 
Himself and the apostles paint and describe, of which | 
am also one by God's grace. For | have been baptized 
and believe that Christ, my Lord, has redeemed me from 
sins by his death and has given me _ eternal 
righteousness and holiness. And cursed be he that 
giveth not this glory to Christ, that he believeth that he 
is justified and sanctified by his death, word, sacraments 
2c. 

Let us therefore cast off this foolish and impious 
delusion concerning the name "saints" (which we 
thought belonged only to the saints in heaven and on 
earth to the hermits and monks who performed certain 
strange works), and let us now learn from sacred 
Scripture that all who believe in Christ are saints. The 
world admires the holiness of Benedictus, Gregory, 
Bernard, Franciscus, and their like, because it hears 
that they did glorious and unusual works. Certainly, 
Hilarius, Cyril, Athanasius, Ambrose, Augustine and 
others were also holy, who lived such a hard and 





They did not lead an austere life like those, but lived 
among people, ate common food, drank wine, and wore 
dainty and appropriate clothing. And as far as the 
ordinary way of life is concerned, there was almost no 
difference between them and other respectable men, 
and yet they are far preferable to the above-mentioned. 
For they taught the faith in Christ purely without any 
superstition, resisted the heretics and purified the 
church from countless errors. The intimate contact with 
them was very pleasant for many people and especially 
for the sad and afflicted (for they did not avoid contact 
with people, but judged their ministry publicly among the 
whole crowd), whom they lifted up and comforted with 
their words. They, on the other hand, not only taught 
many things against the faith, but were also the 
originators of many superstitions, errors and false 
worship. Therefore, if they did not take hold of Christ in 
their last hour and trust in his death and victory alone, 
their strict life was of no use to them. 

This shows sufficiently who the true saints are, and 
what should be called a holy life, namely, not those who 
hide in nooks and caves, weaken their bodies by fasting, 
wear hard shirts, 2c., in the opinion that they want to 
have a special reward in heaven before the other 
Christians, but those who are baptized and believe in 
Christ, 2c, who do not take off the old man and his 
doings at once; but as long as they live, the evil desire 
remains in them, and it does them no harm to feel it, if 
only they do not let it reign, but submit it to the Spirit. 

This teaching gives comfort to godly hearts, so that 
they do not despair when they feel these spears of the 
flesh with which Satan fights against the spirit, as has 
happened to many in the papacy who thought that they 
should not feel any lust of the flesh at all, while neither 
Jerome, nor Gregory, nor Benedictus, nor Bernard and 
others (whom the monks consider perfect examples of 
chastity and of all Christianity) have been able to do so. 


702 Lri. 6ai. Ill, 37-40. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2744-2747. 


The first two books of the Bible, the first two books of the 
Bible and the second book of the Bible, were written in 
the same style as the first book. Rather, they felt it, and 
they felt it intensely, which they openly confess in more 
than one place in their books. Therefore, God has not 
only not imputed these slight transgressions to them, but 
also not the harmful errors that some of them have 
introduced into the Church. Gregory was the originator 
of the private mass, which was the greatest abomination 
that ever entered the Church of the New Testament. 
Others have devised monasticism, godless worship and 


self-chosen clergy (voluntarias religiones). Cyprian 


insisted (disputabat) that those baptized by heretics must 
be rebaptized. 

Therefore, in the holy Christian faith, we rightly 
confess that we believe in a holy church. For she is 
invisible, dwelling in spirit in a place where no one can 
approach, therefore her holiness cannot be seen. For 
God has so hidden it and showered it with infirmities, sins 
and errors, with various forms of the cross and 
aversions, that it never comes to light as far as feeling is 
concerned. When those who do not know this see the 
infirmities, sins, and errors in those who have been 
baptized, have the word, and believe, they immediately 
become angry and judge that they do not belong to the 
church, and meanwhile dream that the hermits and 
monks are the church, who honor God only with their lips 
and serve him in vain, because they do not follow the 
word of God, but the teachings and commandments of 
men, and teach others such things. But because they do 
superstitious and strange works, which reason holds in 
high esteem and admiration, they judge that they are 
holy and the church. They reverse the article of faith: "I 
believe a holy church," and substitute for "I believe": | 
see. Such human righteousness and _ self-chosen 
holiness is in truth spiritual sorcery, by which the eyes 
and minds of men are blinded and led away from the 
knowledge of true holiness. 

But we teach that the church has neither spot nor 
wrinkle, but is holy. 








703 


but by faith in Jesus Christ; then in life by abstaining from 
the lusts of the flesh and practicing spiritual fruits; but it 
is not yet holy because all evil desires are taken away 
from it and it is freed from them, nor because it is 
cleansed from all ungodly opinions and errors. For the 
church always confesses its sin and asks that its guilt be 
forgiven. Likewise, she believes in forgiveness of sins. 
Therefore, the saints sin, fall and also err, but out of 
ignorance, because they did not like to deny Christ, lose 
the gospel, revoke baptism 2c. They therefore have 
forgiveness of sins, and even if they err in doctrine out of 
ignorance, this is forgiven them, because they finally 
recognize their error and base themselves solely on the 
truth and grace of God in Christ, as Jerome, Gregory, 
Bernard and others have done. Therefore, Christians 
should strive to avoid the works of the flesh, to 
completely abstain from lusts; they are not able to do 
this. 

The fact that the godly feel the impurity of their flesh 
is therefore useful to them, so that they are not puffed up 
by the vain and godless delusion of the righteousness of 
works, as if they were in grace with God because of 
them. Inflated by this delusion, the monks thought that 
they were so holy because of their self-chosen way of 
life that they sold their righteousness and holiness to 
others, even though they had the conviction in their own 
hearts that they were impure. Such a harmful corruption 
is the confidence in one's own righteousness, and that 
one lets oneself dream that one is pure. 

But because the godly feel the impurity of their heart, 
they cannot trust in their righteousness. This feeling 


humbles them so that they abandon pride (ut demittant 


cristas) and cannot trust in their good works, and it drives 
them to run to Christ, their reconciler, who does not have 
a corrupt or frail flesh, but a completely pure and 
completely holy one, which he gave for the life of the 
world. In him they find a reliable and fully 


704 oai.t, 40-42. Explanation of Galatians 5, 19. 20. w. vill, 2747-2750. 


705 





righteousness that has come. Thus they remain in 
humility, not a fictitious or monkish humility, but a true 
humility, because of the impurity and the infirmities of 
their flesh, for which they would be guilty of eternal death 
if God were to judge them severely. But because they are 
not proud of God, but humble and brokenhearted, they 
recognize their sins and desire forgiveness, and trusting 
in the beneficence of the mediator Christ, they come 
before the face of God and ask that their sins be forgiven 
for His sake, so God extends His immense heaven of 
grace over them and does not impute their sins to them 
for Christ's sake. 

| say this so that we may beware of the harmful errors 
of the sophists concerning the sanctity of life, by which 
our minds have been so taken that we have not been 
able to shake them off without great difficulty. Therefore, 
take great care to distinguish between true righteousness 
or holiness and hypocrisy. Then you will be able to look 
at the kingdom of Christ with eyes other than reason, that 
is, with spiritual eyes, and will certainly judge that he who 
is baptized and believes in Christ is holy; and then in this 
faith, by which he is justified and forgiven his past and 
present sins, he abstains from fleshly lusts. But he is not 
entirely cleansed from them, for the flesh lusts against 
the Spirit. But this uncleanness remains in him, so that 
he may be humbled, and the grace and good deeds of 
Christ may become sweet to him who is thus humbled. 
So this impurity, and what is left of sin, does not harm the 
godly, but is very useful to them. For the more they feel 
their weakness and their sins, the more they take refuge 
in the throne of grace, Christ, and call upon him for help, 
that he may adorn them with his righteousness, that he 
may increase their faith, give them the Holy Spirit, under 
whose guidance they may overcome the lusts of the 
flesh, that they may not reign but be servants. Thus, a 
Christian constantly struggles with sin, and yet he does 
not succumb in the battle, but gains the victory. 





| have said this so that you may understand, not from 
human dreams, but from the word of God, which people 
are truly holy. We see, then, that Christian doctrine is 
exceedingly useful for edifying consciences; then, that it 
is a doctrine that does not deal with caps, plates, 
rosaries, and such trifling things, but with important and 
exceedingly great things, namely, how we are to 
overcome the flesh, sin, death, and the devil. As this 
doctrine is unknown to the saints of works, it is 
impossible for them to instruct even an erring conscience 
or to comfort and satisfy a frightened and despairing one. 


Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, fornication 2c. 


Paul does not list all the works of the flesh, but uses 
a definite number instead of an indefinite number. First, 
he lists the kinds of unchastity, namely adultery, 
fornication, uncleanness, fornication 2c. But not only is 
unchastity a work of the flesh, as the papists dreamed 
(who also called marriage - so chaste are these people - 
which God Himself instituted, and which they themselves 
count among the sacraments, a work of the flesh), but 
among the works of the flesh he also includes idolatry 
2c., aS we have already said several times above. 
Therefore, this passage already shows sufficiently what 
"flesh" means for Paul. But these words are too well 
known to need any explanation. Whoever wishes to 
know what each individual word means, should read, if 
he wishes, the old interpretation, 1) which we published 
in the year 19. There, to the best of our ability, we have 
sufficiently indicated the meaning of each individual word 
of the entire register of the works of the flesh and the 
fruits of the Spirit. For this was primarily our intention, in 
interpreting the Epistle to the Galatians, to set forth the 
article of justification as clearly as possible 2c. 


V. 20. Idolatry. 


264. the highest spirituality (religiones), sanctity and 
the most fervent worship. 


1) This "shorter interpretation of the Epistle to the Galatians" is 
found in the eighth volume of our edition, Col. 1352. 


706 Lri. Ssi. II, 42-44. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2750-2784. 


707 





Devotiones of those who serve God with the exclusion 
of the mediator, Christ, and without the word and 
command of God, are idolatry, as it was considered the 
most spiritual act in the papacy, when the monks, sitting 
in their cells, And his works, when, inflamed with the 
most fervent devotion, they bent their knees, prayed and 
contemplated heavenly things with such delight that they 
wept with exceeding joy. There was no thought of 
women or any other creature, but only of the Creator and 
his wonderful works, and yet what reason considers the 
most spiritual work is, according to the words of Paul, a 
work of the flesh. Therefore, all such worship by which 
one serves God without His word and command is 
idolatry, and the more holy and spiritual it is in 
appearance, the more harmful and corrupt it is. For it 
turns people away from faith in Christ and causes them 
to base themselves on their own strength, works and 
righteousness, as is also the case today with the 
Anabaptists, although they are making it more evident 
every day that they are possessed by the devil and are 
rebellious and bloodthirsty people. 

Therefore, the fasting, the hard shirt, the most holy 
actions, the rule and the whole life of the Carthusians, 
whose order is the strictest, are works of the flesh, yes, 
idolatry, because they imagine that they are holy and 
become blessed, not through Christ, whom they fear as 
a strict judge, but if they keep their rule. They do indeed 
think about God, Christ and divine things, but not 
according to the word of God, but according to their 
reason, namely that their clothing, food and their whole 
conduct is holy and pleasing to Christ, whom they hope 
not only to reconcile through this their strict life, but that 
he will also be a retributor for their good works and their 
righteousness 2c. Therefore their (as they dream) most 
spiritual thoughts are not only completely carnal, but also 
exceedingly ungodly, because with exclusion and 
contempt of the word, of faith, of Christ 2c. by trusting in 
their own righteousness they blot out sins and attain 
grace and eternal life. 





want. Thus all worship and all spiritual being apart from 
Christ is idolatry. Only in Christ is the Father well 
pleased; he who hears him and does what he commands 
is loved for the sake of the Beloved [Eph. 1:6]. But he 
himself commands us to believe his word, to be baptized 
2c., not to choose new worship 2c. 

| have said above that the works of the flesh are 
manifest, as surely adultery, fornication, and the like are 
known to all. But idolatry has such a_ beautiful 
appearance and is so spiritual that it is known only to a 
few, namely those who believe in Christ. For if a 
Carthusian lives chastely, fasts, prays, reads his seven 


times of prayer (horas canonicas), says mass, etc., there 
is so much lacking in his believing that he is an idolater, 
or that he performs the works of the flesh, that he is 
rather certainly convinced that he is driven and governed 
by the spirit, that he walks in the spirit, that he thinks, 
speaks, and does nothing but spiritual things, and that 
he renders God the most pleasant service. No one will 
be able to persuade the papists today that the corner 
mass is the highest blasphemy and idolatry, as it has 
never been more frightening in the Church since the time 
of the apostles. For they are blinded and stiff-necked, 
therefore they judge wrongly of God and divine things, 
thinking that their idolatry is the right and highest worship 
of God, whereas faith is idolatry 2c. But we, who believe 
in Christ and have his mind, judge everything, and can 
be judged with truth and before God by no one. 

From this it is sufficiently evident that Paul calls all 
that is in man the flesh, in that he groups together all 
three powers of the soul, namely, the will inclined to evil 


desire (concupiscibilem), the will inclined to anger 


(irascibilem), and the mind. The works of the will inclined 
to evil lust are adultery, fornication 2c.; the works of the 
will inclined to anger are quarreling, strife, murder 2c.; 
those of reason or understanding: Error, false clergy or 
worship, superstition, idolatry, heresies, that is, 
rottenness 2c. 

268 It is very useful to know this, because the word 
"flesh" is used throughout the papacy in such a 


708 All- Oai. Ill, 44-47. Explanation of Galatians 5, 20, W. VIII, 2754-2757. 


709 





The fact that a work of the flesh meant nothing to them 


but the work (concubitum) or performance of unchastity 
is obscured. From this it necessarily followed that they 
could not understand Paul. But here we see clearly that 
Paul includes among the works of the flesh idolatry and 
heresy, which, as we have said, reason considers to be 
the highest virtues, wisdom, godliness, holiness and 
righteousness. Paul calls it Col. 2, 18. the "spirituality of 
angels". But no matter how holy and spiritual idolatry 
may seem to be, it is nothing but a work of the flesh, an 
abomination and idolatry against the gospel, faith and 
right worship. This is seen by the godly and the faithful 
who have spiritual eyes, but the saints of works judge 
differently. Just as a monk cannot be persuaded that his 
vows are works of the flesh, so a Turk believes nothing 
less than that his keeping of the Alkoran, the ablutions 
and the other customs he observes are works of the 
flesh. It is truly a great thing to count idolatry among the 
works of the flesh 2c. 
Magic. 

| have spoken of sorcery in the third chapter above. 
This was a common sin in our time before the gospel 
came forth. When | was a child, there were many 
sorceresses who bewitched cattle and _ people, 
especially children. They also damaged the crops by 
storms and hailstorms, which they caused by their 
sorceries. Now that the gospel has come to light, such 
things are not heard, because the gospel pushes the 
devil from his throne with his dazzling work. But he now 
charms people with more frightening, namely spiritual 
sorceries. 

270 Paul lists sorcery among the works of the flesh, 
which, as everyone knows, is not a work of unchastity, 


but an abuse or imitation (aemulatio) of idolatry. For 


sorcery (magia) makes a covenant with devils, 
superstition or idolatry with gods, but not with the right 
god, but with a made god. Therefore 


idolatry is in truth spiritual sorcery. For as enchantresses 
enchant cattle and men, so the idolaters, that is, all 
works saints, want to enchant God that he is such as 
they invent him in their thoughts. But they invent him as 
one who does not justify them by grace and faith in 
Christ, but who should look upon their self-chosen 
worship and works and give them righteousness and 
eternal life for their sake. But they charm themselves, 
not God, because if they persist in this ungodly opinion 
of God, they will die in idolatry and be condemned. Most 
of the works of the flesh are sufficiently known, therefore 
they do not need any interpretation. 


Rotten. 


Here he does not call the divisions that arise in the 
household or in the worldly government because of 
bodily and worldly things, but which arise in the church 
for the sake of doctrine, faith and works. Heresies, that 
is, rottenness, have always existed in the church, as has 
been said above in several places, but the pope is the 


supreme arch-heretic (generalis haeresiarcha) and the 
head of all heretics. For he has filled the whole world, as 
it were, with a flood of sin with innumerable mobs. No 
monk agrees with the other, because they measure 
holiness according to the difficulty of the orders. 
Therefore, a Carthusian wants to be considered holier 
than a Franciscan 2c. Therefore, in the papist church 
there is no unity of spirit, no harmony of minds, but the 
greatest discord. It is not one and the same doctrine, 
faith, religion, worship and attitude, but everything is 
completely different. 

In contrast, among Christians everything is the same 
and common, the Word, faith, worship, religion, the 
sacraments, Christ, God; the same heart, mind, soul, 
will, and this spiritual unity is not hindered by the 
difference of status and position in outward conduct, as 
has been shown above a few times. And those who 
have this unity of spirit possess

711 





also a certain judgment on all the rotten ones, which no 
one else quite recognizes, as certainly no theologian in 
the papacy has understood that Paul in this passage 


condemns all worship and spiritual states (religiones), 


false chastity (continentiam) and the seemingly 
honorable conduct and holy life of all papists and rotten 
spirits, but meant that he is talking about the gross 
idolatry and heresies of the pagans and the Turks, who 
obviously blaspheme the name of Christ 2c. 


v. 21. Drinking and eating. 


Paul does not say that eating and drinking are works 
of the flesh, but drinking and eating, which is very 
common in our country. Those who indulge in this more 
than animalistic indulgence should know that they are 
not spiritual people, however much they may boast of it, 
but that they follow the flesh and do its works; therefore 
they must hear the terrible judgment that they will not 
inherit the kingdom of God. 

So Paul wants Christians to avoid drinking and 


gluttony (crapulam) and to live soberly and moderately, 
so that they are not provoked to lust by the well-fed 
meat, since after gluttony, and when one fills the 
stomach too much, the meat tends to rage violently. But 
it is not enough to curb only this raging lust, which 
gluttony entails, but also, when one is sober, one should 
keep the flesh in check, so that it does not carry out its 
lusts. For it often happens that those who are 
exceedingly sober are the most challenged, as Jerome 
writes of himself. The face, he says, was pale from 
fasting, and the mind burned with lusts in a cold body, 
and while the flesh alone had died sooner than the man 
to whom it belonged, the fires of lust were kindled 2c. 1) 
| have also experienced this myself, since | was a monk. 
Therefore, fasting alone will not extinguish the fires of 
unchastity, but the spirit must be added, that is, the 
diligent handling of the word, faith and the 


1) Cf. § 211 of Chapter 5. 





Prayer. While fasting overcomes the grosser beginnings 
of unchastity, the lusts of the flesh themselves are not 
overcome by partaking of food and drink, but by 
earnestly attending to the word and calling upon Christ. 


And the like. 


275 For it is impossible to enumerate all the works of 
the flesh. 


Of whom I have told you before, and still say 
before, that those who do these things will not inherit 
the kingdom of God. 


This is a very harsh judgment, and yet extremely 
necessary against the false Christians and sure 
hypocrites, who boast of the Gospel, faith and the Spirit, 
and yet quite surely perform the works of the flesh. But 
especially the heretics, puffed up by their false delusion 
(as they dream themselves to be) of exceedingly spiritual 
things, are people possessed by the devil and wholly 
carnal, and therefore they perform the lusts of the flesh 
with all the powers of their souls. Therefore, it was most 
necessary that the apostle passed such a frightening and 
fearful sentence against such sure despisers and stiff- 
necked hypocrites, that those who perform such works 
of the flesh, which Paul listed, do not attain the kingdom 
of God, so that some of them, frightened by this severe 
sentence, might begin to fight against the works of the 
flesh through the Spirit, so that they do not perform them. 


v. 22. But the fruit of the Spirit is. 


277. He does not say: The works of the spirit, as he 
said: "Works of the flesh", but adorns these Christian 
virtues with a more dignified name, calling them "the fruit 
of the spirit". For they have exceedingly great benefit and 
fruit, for those who are adorned with them give glory to 
GOD, and with these virtues they attract others to the 
teaching of Christ and to faith in Him. 


Love. 


It would have been enough if he had mentioned love 
alone. For love extends to all the fruits of the spirit, and 


712 Lit. ai. Il, 49-52. Explanation of Galatians 5, 22, W. VIll, 2760-2763. 


Paul attributes to it all the fruits of the spirit in 1 Cor. 13:4 
when he says: "Love is longsuffering and kind" 2c. But 
here he has especially included it among the fruits of the 
Spirit and placed it in the first place, in order to remind 
Christians that they should love one another above all 
things, that through love one should precede the other 
with reverence, and that each should esteem the other 
more highly than himself, for the sake of Christ and the 
Holy Spirit who dwells in them, for the sake of the word, 
baptism, and other divine gifts that Christians have. 
Joy. 

This is a word of the bridegroom and the bride, that 
is, sweet thoughts of Christ, wholesome exhortations, 
joyful songs, hymns, thanksgivings, by which the godly 
admonish, exercise and cheer up one another. For God 
has no pleasure in sadness of spirit, He hates sad 
teaching, sad thoughts and words, and delights in 
gladness. For he did not send his Son to make us sad, 
but to make us glad. Therefore the prophets, the 
apostles, and Christ Himself everywhere enjoin, yea, 
command, that we should rejoice and be glad. 
Zechariah Cap. 9, 9. says, "Be glad, O daughter of Zion, 
and rejoice, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King 
cometh unto thee," and in the Psalms we often read [Ps. 
32, 11. 33, 1.], "Be glad in the Lord." Paul says [Phil. 4, 
4.], "Rejoice in the Lord always," 2c., and Christ [Luc. 
10, 20.], "Rejoice that your names are written in 
heaven." Where there is this joy of the Spirit, the heart 
is inwardly joyful through faith in Christ, believing that he 
is our Savior and High Priest, and shows this joy by 
heart in words and gestures. Likewise, the godly rejoice 
when the gospel is spread far and wide and many come 
to faith, and thus the kingdom of Christ is increased. 

Peace. 
280. peace with God and with men, so that Christians 
may be quiet and peaceful and not persecute one 
another with hatred, but 





713 


Bear one another's burdens with patience, for without 
patience peace cannot stand. That is why Paul puts it 
immediately after peace. 


Patience. 
| believe that "patience" (uaypoivuia) here is the 


persevering patience (assiduitatem patientiae) with 
which one not only suffers adversities, misfortunes, 
insults 2c. but also long-sufferingly expects that those 
who have done him harm will mend their ways. For the 
devil cannot overcome the afflicted by force, but he 
overcomes them by perseverance; for he knows that we 
are earthen vessels, which cannot bear frequent and 
long-continued blows and attacks. Therefore, he 
overcomes many by long perseverance. To overcome 
his perseverance, longsuffering is necessary. This 
patiently awaits both the improvement of those who use 
violence and the end of the temptations that the devil 
arouses. 


Friendliness. 


282. kindness (ypyatotys) is a ge 
The Christian must be gentle and pleasant in manners 


and in all of life. For the Christians must not be rough 
and sullen, but mild, affable, accessible, friendly, who 
like to deal with others, who overlook the errors of others 
or at least interpret them for the best, who like to yield to 
others, who bear the miraculous 2c., as also the pagans 


said: The infirmities (mores) of a friend you may know, 
but do not hate him. Such a man was Christ, as can be 
seen everywhere in the Gospel. Of St. Peter it is read 
that he wept as often as he remembered the kindness of 
Christ, which he showed in his daily intercourse. This is 
a very great virtue and necessary in every state. 
Kindness. 
That is, to gladly supply the want of others, to be 


munificent (largiri), to lend 2c. 
Faith. 


Since Paul lists faith among the fruits of the spirit, it 
is obvious that he does not mean faith in Christ, but 
honesty or sincerity. Therefore he says in 1 Cor. 13:7 
that love believes everything. Whoever therefore has this 
faith 


714 1. 6ai. 1, 52-54. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2763-2766. 


715 





He is not a suspicious man, but a man of one-stringed 
and sincere heart, who, although he is deceived and 
learns something other than what he believes, is so 
gentle that he gladly gives credit for it; in short, he 
believes everyone, but puts his trust in no one. 

On the other hand, people who do not have this 
virtue are suspicious, it is difficult to get along with them, 
they are grumpy and poisonous. They yield to no one, 
believe no one, cannot bear anything that others say and 
do good, slander and misrepresent them, and hate those 
by whom they are not praised and held in high esteem. 
Therefore it is impossible for them to show love and 
friendship, to keep unity and peace with people. But 
when they are gone, this present life is nothing but biting 
and eating. "Faith" in this place, then, is one keeping 
faith with the other in the things that belong to the 
present life. For what would this life of ours be if one did 
not believe the other? 


Sanftmuth. 


This is the virtue that one is not easily moved to 
anger. In this life, however, there are countless incidents 
that provoke anger, but the godly overcome them 
through meekness. 


Chastity. 


This is sobriety, temperance or moderation in the 
whole life, which Paul contrasts with the works of the 
flesh. So he wants Christians to live chastely and 
soberly, so that they are not adulterers, fornicators or 
lewd people. If they cannot live chastely, they are to 
become conjugal. Likewise, they are not to be 
quarrelsome and vicious, 2c. not to get drunk, not to give 
in to gluttony, but to abstain from all these things. All this 
includes chastity or abstinence. Jerome interprets it to 
refer to virginity alone, as if husbands and wives could 
not be chaste, or the apostle wrote this to virgins alone. 
It is certain that he admonishes the bishops and the 
young women, both of whom were married, to be chaste 
and pure. 





V. 23. The law is not against such. 


288. It is indeed a law, but not against such. Thus he 
says elsewhere [1 Tim. 1, 9.]: "No law is given to the 
righteous." For the righteous lives in such a way that he 
has no need of a law to admonish, urge and compel him, 
but without all compulsion of the law he does voluntarily 
what the law demands. Therefore the law cannot accuse 
those who believe in Christ and convict them of their 
guilt, 1) nor can it frighten their consciences. It does 
indeed frighten and accuse, but Christ, taken in faith, 
drives it away with his terrors and threats. That is why 
the law is absolutely abolished for them. Therefore, it 
has no right to accuse them, because they voluntarily do 
what the law demands. For through faith they have 
received the Holy Spirit, who will not let them be idle. If 
the flesh resists, they walk in the spirit 2c. Thus a 
Christian fulfills the law inwardly by faith, for Christ is the 
end of the law; he who believes in him is justified 
outwardly by works and by the forgiveness of sins. But 
those who perform the works and lusts of the flesh, the 
law accuses and condemns, civilly and theologically. 


V. 24 But those who belong to Christ crucify their 
flesh along with their lusts and desires. 


This whole passage about works shows that true 
believers are not hypocrites, so let no one deceive 
himself. All those, he says, who belong to Christ crucify 
their flesh together with infirmities and sins. For the 
saints, who have not yet completely taken off the corrupt 
flesh, are inclined to sin, do not fear and love God 
enough 2c., likewise they are provoked to anger, envy, 
impatience, unchastity and other evil impulses, which, 
however, they do not accomplish, for, as Paul says here, 
they crucify their flesh with its lusts and sins, which 
happens not only by suppressing the will of the flesh with 
fasting or other exercises, but, as Paul said above [v. 
16], because they walk in the spirit, that is, 


1) 6t reos AA6r6 is missing in the Wittenberg. 


716 Iri. OL>. Ill, 54-56. Explanation of Galatians 5, 24. 25. W. VIII, 2766-2772. 


717 





since, reminded by the divine threats by which God 
threatens that He will punish sin severely, they are 
deterred from sinning, likewise, being equipped by the 
Word, faith and prayer, they do not obey the lusts of the 
flesh. 

By resisting the flesh in this way, they nail it to the 
cross with its lusts and desires, so that the flesh, though 
still alive and stirring, cannot accomplish what it wants, 
since it is bound to the cross with hands and feet. Thus, 
the godly crucify their 


Flesh, as long as they live here, that is, they feel its lusts, 
but they do not obey them. For clothed with the armor of 
God, faith, hope and the sword of the spirit, they fight 
against the flesh, and with these spiritual weapons they 
fasten it to the cross as with nails, so that it is forced to 
be subject to the spirit even against its will. After that, 
when they die, they strip it completely, and when they 
are raised again, they will have a pure flesh, without 
lusts and desires. 





The sixth chapter. 


Cap. 5, 25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk 
in the Spirit. 

(1) Paul has expressly included heresy and hatred 
among the works of the flesh, and has judged those who 
stir up hatred and sectarianism that they will not inherit 
the kingdom of God. Now, as if he had forgotten what 
he had done just before, he again, in a new speech, 
singles out those who are indignant and hateful among 
themselves. Why does he do this? Was it not enough 
that he did this once? Paul does this on purpose, 
because he wants to attack the most abominable vice, 
which is called "vain glory", because it was the cause of 
the disruption of all the churches in Galatia, and has 
always been harmful and corrupting to the Christian 
church. Therefore, as he writes to Titus [Cap. 1, 7.], he 
does not want a haughty bishop to be appointed. For 
arrogance, as Augustine rightly says, is the mother of all 
heresies, indeed, the source of all sins and all ruin 


(ruinae), as the sacred and secular histories testify. 

But vain honor is at all times an extremely 
widespread corruption in the world, which even the 
pagan poets and historians have severely rebuked. 
There is no village in which one or the other does not 
want to be respected as clever and great above all 
others. 





(3) But it is mainly gifted people who suffer from this 
vice, who quarrel because of their learning and wisdom. 
Here no one wants to give way to the other, and it goes 
according to this word: He who would give way to a wise 


head would be nothing (Qui volet ingenio cedere, nullus 


erit). It does people good to point fingers at them and 
say: That is the man. Nowadays Italy suffers from vain 
honor in a very special way, as Greece once did. But with 
private people, yes, even with those who hold a 
magisterial office, it is not so harmful as with those who 
preside over the church, although it also becomes in the 
world regime, especially when it affects the highest- 
ranking people, not only a cause of disruption and 


overthrow of the commonwealth (rerum publicarum), but 
also of disruption and change of kingdoms and empires, 
which all histories of the holy Scriptures and the pagans 
testify. 

(4) But when this pestilence creeps into the church or 
the spiritual kingdom, it cannot be said how harmful it is. 
For there is no dispute about learning, intellect, beauty, 
treasures, kingdoms, empires, etc., but either about 
salvation and life, or about damnation and eternal death. 

5 Therefore Paul most earnestly exhorts those who 
are in the ministry of the Word from this vice, saying, "If 
we live in the Spirit," 2c. as if to say: If 


718 ozi.ai. in, 56-59. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vin, 2772-2774. 


719 





it is true that we live in the spirit, let us also remain in 
order and walk in the spirit. For where the spirit is, it 
renews people, produces new emotions in them, that is, 
from people who are stingy for vain honor, angry, spiteful 
2c., it makes humble, gentle, patient people 2c. Such do 
not seek their own honor, but God's; they do not 
indignantly hate one another, but yield to one another, 
and one precedes the other with reverence. On the other 
hand, those who are avaricious of vain honor, who are 
indignant and hateful toward one another, may boast that 
they have the spirit, that they live in the spirit, but they 
deceive themselves; they follow the flesh and do its 
works, and have their judgment that they will not inherit 
the kingdom of God. 

(6) As there is nothing more pernicious, so there is 
nothing more common in the church than this 
abominable vice. For where God sends laborers into His 
harvest, Satan soon awakens his servants, who do not 
want to be considered inferior in any respect to those 
who are duly called. Here the quarrel soon arises. The 
wicked do not want to give way to the godly even by a 
hair's breadth, for they dream that they far surpass them 
in intellect, in doctrine, in godliness and in spirit (much 
less must the godly give way to the wicked, lest the 
doctrine of faith be endangered). In addition, this is the 
way of Satan's servants, that they do not only know how 
to pretend love, unity, humility and other fruits of the spirit 
to their own, but also praise each other, give preference 
to one over the other and say that others are better than 
they are. Therefore, they do not want to be regarded as 
anything less than people who are avaricious of vain 
honor; indeed, they swear that they seek nothing but the 
honor of God and the salvation of souls, and yet they are 
exceedingly eager for vain honor, and do everything to 
attain high esteem and praise among men before others. 
In short, they think that godliness is a trade, and that the 
ministry of the word is given to them so that they can 
become famous through it, and therefore it cannot be 
lacking that they cause trouble and mobs. 

7 Therefore, because the vain glory of the false 
apostles had been the cause of the churches 





In Galatia, when the people were disturbed and fell away 
from Paul, he wanted to attack this pernicious vice in a 
special speech and a chapter of his own. Yes, this vice 
caused Paul to write this whole epistle, and if he had not 
written it, all the effort he had put into preaching the 
gospel to the Galatians would have been in vain. For 
since he was absent, the false apostles held sway in 
Galatia, people who, it seemed, held great prestige, 
who, besides claiming that they sought the glory of Christ 
and the salvation of the Galatians, also kept company 
with the apostles, boasting that they followed in their 
footsteps in teaching. Then, because Paul had not seen 
Christ in the flesh, nor had he had intercourse with the 
apostles, they despised him in comparison with 
themselves, rejected his teaching, and boasted that their 
teaching was the true and genuine one. And so they 
misled the Galatians and stirred up divisions among 
them, so that they were indignant and hated one 
another, which was a sure sign that neither teachers nor 
disciples lived and walked in the Spirit, but followed the 
flesh and performed its works, and consequently that 
they had lost the right doctrine, faith, Christ, all the gifts 
of the Spirit, and were now worse than the Gentiles. 2c. 

(8) Not only does he attack the false apostles who 
confused the churches in his time, but he foresaw in the 
spirit that until the end of the world there would be 
countless such people who, tainted with this extremely 
harmful vice, would break into the church without a 
profession, boast of the Spirit and heavenly doctrine, 
and under this pretext overthrow the right doctrine and 
faith. In our time, too, we have seen many such people 
who have forced their way into the realm of the spirit, that 
is, into the ministry of the word, without a profession, and 
wanted to be respected for a time for teaching the same 
as we do, and by this pretense they have made a name 
for themselves and the reputation that they were 
teachers of the gospel who lived in the spirit and walked 
according to the order. But as soon as they had attracted 
the great multitude to themselves by their flattering 
speeches, they departed from the 


720 tri. oni. m1, (p-61]. Explanation of Galatians 5, 25, W. vill, 2774-2777. 


721 





They began to teach something new, so that they would 
become famous in this way and be praised by the 
people, that they had been the first to denounce the 
errors in the church, had stopped and improved the 
abuses, had overthrown the papacy, and had found a 
new, glorious doctrine, and therefore they would rightly 
have the first place 1) among the evangelical teachers. 
But because their fame was not based on God, but on 
the talk of men, it could not be firm and lasting, but, as 
Paul prophesied, it has come to shame, and their end is 
damnation. For the wicked do not stand in judgment, but 
like chaff they are carried away and scattered by the 
wind. The same judgment awaits all who seek their own 
with the teaching of the gospel, not that which is of 
Christ. 

(9) For the gospel was not given for us to seek our 
own praise and glory, or for the people to revere and 
magnify us as ministers of the gospel, but that through it 
Christ's good deeds and glory might be glorified, that the 
Father might be glorified in his mercy, which he showed 
us in Christ his Son, whom he gave up for us all, and 
with him gave us all things. Therefore, the gospel is such 
a doctrine in which we must seek nothing less than our 
glory. It holds out heavenly and eternal things which are 
not ours, which we have neither made nor earned, but it 
offers them to us, who are not worthy of them, out of the 
pure goodness of God. Why, then, should we arrogate 
honor to ourselves for their sake? Therefore, he who 
seeks honor in the Gospel speaks of himself. But he who 
speaks of himself is a liar, and there is unrighteousness 
in him. On the other hand, "he who seeks the glory of 
Him who sent Him is true, and there is no 
unrighteousness in him," John 7:18. 

10 Paul therefore very earnestly exhorts all ministers 
of the Word, saying, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also 
walk in the Spirit," that is, let us abide in the right order, 
that is, in the doctrine of the 


1) In Latin: primas; this should be woyl prinaatuin. Menius did not 
translate this; about half of this paragraph is missing in his translation. 


Truth, as it is once preached, in brotherly love and unity 
of spirit. Let us preach Christ and the glory of God with 
a simple heart and ascribe everything to him; let us not 
want to be better than the other, let us not create mobs. 
For this does not mean to walk rightly, but to leave the 
right order and to establish something new and wrong. 

From this it can be understood that God, by special 
grace, subjects the teachers of the Gospel to the cross 
and to all kinds of tribulations for their own good and for 
the good of the people, for otherwise He could not in any 
way suppress and destroy this beast, which is called 
vain glory. For if the doctrine of the Gospel had nothing 
but praise, admiration and honor among men, and by all 
means no persecution, cross, disgrace 2c. followed, 
then surely all its confessors would be infected by the 
plague of vain honor and perish. Jerome says 
somewhere on this opinion that he had seen many who 
could endure many accidents to body and goods, but 
none who had been able to despise his praise. For it is 
impossible that any should not be puffed up by the 
praise of him. Paul, who has the Spirit of Christ, says [2 
Cor. 12:7] that Satan's angel, who beat him with fists, 
was given to him for this reason, that he might not exalt 
himself to high revelation. Therefore Augustine rightly 
says: If a minister of the word is praised, he is in danger; 
if a brother despises him and does not praise him, the 
brother is in danger. He who hears that | teach God's 
word is guilty of honoring me for the word's sake; if he 
honors me, he does well; but if | become arrogant 
thereby, | am in danger; on the other hand, if he 
despises me, | am without danger, but he is not. 

(12) Therefore we are to put this into practice in every 
possible way, that we honor our treasure, that is, the 
ministry of preaching, the sacraments, 2c. likewise, that 
we give honor one to another, the hearers to the 
teachers, and again, according to the saying [Rom. 
12:10.], "One come before the other with reverence." 
But where this happens, the flesh is immediately tickled 
by these praises and becomes hopeful. For there is no 
one.

not even among the godly who would not rather desire 
to be praised than rebuked, unless someone is so well 
fortified in this respect that he is not moved by either 
praise or reproach, as that woman said of David, 2 Sam. 
14, 17. "My lord the king is like an angel of God, that he 
may hear good and evil"; likewise Paul [2 Cor. 6, 8.]: "By 
honor and dishonor, by evil rumors and good rumors" 2c. 
Such people, who are neither proud by praise nor 
depressed by reproach, but simple-mindedly strive to 
preach the benefits and glory of Christ and to seek the 
salvation of souls, walk in the right order. On the other 
hand, those who become proud by the price of their 
glory, seeking their own honor rather than Christ's, or 
those who are moved by reviling and shame, may give 
up the preaching ministry; both are not walking 
according to the order 2c. 

013 Therefore let every one that glorieth in the Spirit 
take heed that he abide in the right order. When you are 
praised, know that it is not you who are praised, but 
Christ, to whom all praise and glory is due. For that you 
teach godly, live holy, these are not your gifts, but God's 
gifts, so you are not praised, but God in you. If you 
recognize this, you will remain in the right order, will not 
become proud through glory (for "what do you have that 
you have not received?" [1 Cor. 4, 7.]), but will bring it 
home to God again, will not be moved to give up your 
profession even through revilings, disgraces and 
persecutions 2c. 

So, God, out of special grace, is today showering our 
honor with shame, the most bitter hatred, persecutions 
and blasphemies of the whole world, then with contempt 
and ingratitude on the part of our own, the peasants, 
burghers and nobility (whose enmity and persecution 
against the Gospel is hidden and internal, but more 
harmful than that of the enemies who persecute it 
publicly), so that we do not become proud because of 


our gifts. This ass's burden (molam asinariam) must be 


hung on our necks, lest we be infected by this plague of 
vain glory. 





(15) Though there are some of our own who honor 
us for the preaching ministry, where is one who honors 
us? But there are a hundred who hate, despise and 
persecute us 2c. Now these blasphemies and 
persecutions of the adversaries, and the exceedingly 
great contempt, ingratitude, and very bitter secret hatred 
of those among whom we live, is, of course, such a lovely 


sight (Spectra), which so exhilarates us that we easily 
forget the vain honor. Therefore we are joyful in the Lord 
and remain in the right order. We surpass others in 
spiritual gifts, but because we recognize that they are 
gifts of God, not our own, given to us for the edification of 
the body of Christ, we are not arrogant because of them, 
for we know that more is demanded of those who are 
commanded much than of those who are commanded 
little; moreover, we know that before God there is no 
respect for the person. Therefore, a doorkeeper 


(aedituus) who is faithful in what he is given is no less 
pleasing to God than a teacher of the Word, because he 
serves God in the same faith and spirit. Therefore we 
should honor the least Christians no less than they honor 
us, and in this way we remain free from the plague of vain 
honor, and walk in the spirit. 1) 

(16) On the other hand, because the enthusiasts 
seek their own honor, the favor and applause of men, 
peace with the world and rest of the flesh, not the honor 
of Christ and the salvation of souls (although they 
constantly swear that they do so), they cannot refrain 
from breaking forth and praising their doctrine and work, 
blaming and perverting that of others, having only this 
one thing in mind, that they may gain a great name and 
praise before others. No one, they say, has known this 
before me, | am the first who has seen and taught this 2c. 
Such people, who are stingy of vain honor, do not boast 
themselves in glory, but they boast themselves, are 
courageous and bold, when the great crowd applauds 
them, which they attract with wonderful art. For they know 
how to pretend with words, gestures and writings. 


1) In this and the preceding paragraph, Menius' translation offers 
only a few words of the Latin original, but other explanations. 


724 Li-1. vsi. Ill, 64-66. Explanation of Galatians 5, 26. 6, 1. 


W. VIII, 2780-2783. 725 





and hide everything. Without the applause of the mob, 
they are exceedingly fearful, for they hate and flee the 
cross of Christ and persecution. On the other hand, 
where they have the great crowd to themselves, who 
applaud them, there can be nothing more proud and 
daring: no Hector, no Achilles is as brave and bold as 
they are. 

(17) So deceitful is the flesh, that for no other cause 
doth it forsake the right order, pervert and corrupt the 
right doctrine, and divide the concord of the churches, 
than because of this accursed vain glory. That is why 
Paul attacks them so sharply here and elsewhere. Above 
in the fourth chapter [v. 17.] he says: "They do not 
jealousy for you fine, but they want to make you 
disparaging of me, that you should jealous for them", that 
is, they want to obscure me, so that they themselves 
become famous. They seek not the glory of Christ and 
your blessedness, but their own glory, my dishonor, and 
your bondage. 


Cap. 5,26. Let us not be stingy with vain honor. 


That is, let us not become ambitious people, which, 
as | have said, is done by boasting, not in goodness and 
in truth, but in lies, by the opinion, speech and applause 
of the mob. There is not a firm foundation for fame, but 
a lying one, therefore it is impossible for it to last long. 
He who praises a man as a man lies, because there is 
nothing in him worthy of praise, but everything is 
condemned. Therefore, as far as our person is 
concerned, our glory is this: All have sinned and are 
guilty of eternal death before God. But it is something 
else when our ministry is praised. Therefore, we must 
not only desire, but also strive with all our might to bring 
about that men will esteem it highly and hold it in all 
honor, for this will be their blessedness. Paul exhorts the 
Romans that they give no one offense, saying, "See to it 
that your treasure is not blasohemed" [Rom. 14:16], and 
elsewhere [2 Cor. 6:3], "That our ministry be not 
blasphemed." So when our ministry is commended, we 
are not commended for our person 





praised, but we are praised, as the Psalm says, in GOD 
and His holy name. 1) 


To outrage and hate among themselves. 


Here he describes the effects of vain honor. The 
teacher of an error and the founder of a new doctrine 
cannot help being indignant to others. If they do not 
approve and accept his teaching, he immediately begins 
to hate them bitterly. 

20 We have seen in our time how irreconcilable 
hatred was kindled against us by the enthusiasts, 
because we did not want to give way to them and did not 
want to approve of their errors. We certainly did not 
outrage them first, nor did we spread ungodly doctrine in 
the world, but since we punished the abuses in the 
church and faithfully taught the article of justification, we 
remained in the right order. Those left the same and 
taught in an ungodly way many things that are against 
God's word, about the sacraments, about original sin, 
about the oral word 2c. Then we stood against them, lest 
we should lose the truth of the gospel, and condemned 
their pernicious errors. Since they did not want to suffer 
this, they not only outraged us at first, through no fault of 
our own, but are still hostile to us and hate us bitterly, 
incited to this by nothing other than vain honor. For they 
would have liked to put us in the shade and have the 
kingdom alone. For they dreamed that it was a great 
honor to confess the gospel, when in fact there is no 
greater shame before the world 2c. 


Chapter 6,i. Dear brethren, if a man be overtaken in 
any fault, restore him with a gentle spirit, ye that are 
spiritual. 

This is another beautiful commandment concerning 


life (morale), and very necessary at this time. The 
Sacramentarians interpret this passage for themselves 
and draw from it this conclusion, that we have to give to 
fallen brothers 


1) Of this paragraph Menius brings less than half; the following 
paragraph is brought to double. 


726

727 





The reason for this is that the Christians have to be 
patient and cover their error with love, which believes 
everything, hopes everything, bears everything, 
especially since Paul teaches here in clear words that 
those who are spiritual help the erring again with a gentle 
spirit. The matter is not of such great importance that one 
should tear apart Christian unity because of this one 
article, which is the most beautiful and useful thing that 
the Christian church has 2c. In this way they admonish 


us very strongly that we should forgive sins (amplificant 


nobis remissionem peccatorum), and accuse us of being 
obstinate, since we do not yield to them even a hair's 
breadth, nor do we want to bear their error (although they 
do not want to confess it openly), much less punish and 
restore them with a gentle spirit. Thus the lovely people 
adorn themselves and their cause, and make us very 
hated by many 2c. 

No matter [Christ is my witness] has tormented me 
now for a number of years as much as this disagreement 
in doctrine, which | did not cause, which the 
Sacramentarians also know very well, if they only want to 
confess the truth. For the same things that | have 
believed and taught from the beginning of this matter, 
concerning justification, the sacraments and all other 
articles of Christian doctrine, | still believe and confess 
today, and with even greater certainty (for this has 
become greater through study, practice and experience, 
then also through great and frequent temptations), and 
daily | pray Christ to keep and strengthen me in this faith 
and confession until the day of his glorious future, amen. 

Furthermore, it is well known throughout Germany 
that the doctrine of the Gospel was first challenged by no 
one but the papists alone. But among those who 
accepted it there was the greatest unanimity in all the 
articles of Christian doctrine, which lasted until the 
sectarians came forth with their new opinions, not only of 
the sacraments, but also of other articles. From that time 
on, as it could not be otherwise, more and more 





The result of this is that we have become the subject of 
a great unrighteousness. Therefore, they do us this 
great injustice against their conscience, and without our 
having deserved it, they impose this unbearable 
disgrace on us before the whole world. It is very painful 
when an innocent person has to bear the punishment 
that another deserves, especially in such an important 
matter. 

(24) But we could easily forget this wrong and receive 
them and help them with a gentle spirit, if they would 
only return to the right course and walk with us in the 
right order, that is, if they would godly keep and teach 
the Lord's Supper and other articles of Christian 
doctrine, and be of the same mind with us, preaching not 
their opinions but Christ, so that the Son of God might 
be glorified through us, and through him the Father. But 
that they only exalt love and unity, and belittle the matter 
of the sacrament, as if it were something quite 
insignificant, as much as we think of the Holy 
Communion, which our Lord Christ instituted, is not ours 
to suffer. But as highly as they praise the unity of life, so 
much must we praise the unity in doctrine and faith. If 
they leave us these unharmed, let us also at the same 
time exalt with them the unity of love, which is far from 
being equal to unity in faith or in spirit. For if you have 
lost this, you have lost Christ; but if he is lost, love can 
profit you nothing. 

(25) On the other hand, if you keep the unity of the 
Spirit and of Christ, there is no harm in not being of one 
mind with those who corrupt the word and thereby 
separate the unity of the Spirit. Therefore | would rather 
that they and the whole world should depart from me and 
be with them, than that | should depart from Christ and 
have him for an enemy, which would happen if | were to 
leave his clear and manifest word and adhere to their 
vain dreams, with which they pervert Christ's words to 
their opinion. The One Christ is greater to me than 
innumerable unities in love. 


728 oii. ttai. 11, 69-71. Explanation of Galatians 6, 1. w. vill, 2786 #. 729 





(26) Moreover, we beseech ourselves that we will not 
only keep peace and unity with those who love Christ, 
and teach and believe his word godly, but also bear their 
infirmities and sins, and, if they have fallen, restore them 
with a gentle spirit, according to this commandment of 
Paul. Thus Paul bore the weakness and fall of the 
Galatians and others who had perverted the false 
apostles, because they repented from the heart. Thus 
he again accepts the incestuous man at Corinth with 
grace [2 Cor. 2:5 ff]. Likewise Onesimus, the runaway 
slave, whom he had begotten to Christ in his bonds at 
Rome [Philem. v. 10.], he reconciled again to his Lord. 
Therefore he proved by deed what he teaches here and 
elsewhere, that one should receive the weak and restore 
the fallen, but only against those who could be helped, 
that is, those who from the heart recognized their sin, 
their fall and error and repented. In contrast, he dealt 
very harshly with the stubborn false apostles who 
defended their doctrine and said that it was not 
erroneous but true. He says [Cap. 5, 12]: "Would to God 
that they also were cut off who disturb you", further [Cap. 
5, 10]: "But whoever causes you to err, he shall bear his 
judgment, whoever he will"; likewise [Cap. 1, 8]: "But if 
we also, or an angel from heaven" 2c., "let him be 
accursed." 

27 And there is no doubt that many have defended 
the false apostles against Paul, saying that they also had 
the Spirit, were also servants of Christ, and taught the 
gospel, as Paul did. Even though they did not agree with 
Paul in all respects, he did not have to pass such a 
terrible judgment against them; with such obstinacy he 
was doing nothing but confusing the congregations and 
disrupting their beautiful unity. Paul was not moved by 
such speeches, but confidently cursed and condemned 
the false apostles, calling them destroyers of the 
churches and perverters of the gospel of Christ. On the 
other hand, he exalts his teaching so high that he wants 
everything to give way to it, the unity of love, the 
apostles, an angel from heaven 2c. 


1(28) We also do not allow this thing to be made 
small, because he to whom this thing belongs is great. 
Once, of course, he was small when he lay in the 
manger, and yet at that time he was so great that he was 
worshipped by the angels and praised as the Lord of all 
things. Therefore, we will not suffer his word to be 
violated in any article. In the articles of faith nothing must 
seem small or slight to us, which we should or could 
slacken. For the forgiveness of sins belongs to those 
who are weak in faith or life, who recognize their sins 
and desire mercy, not to those who pervert the doctrine, 
who do not recognize their error and sin, but hostilely 
argue that these are truth and righteousness, and by this 
they cause us to lose the forgiveness of sins, for they 
pervert and deny the word that preaches and brings 
forgiveness of sins. Therefore they must first be in 
harmony with us in Christ, that is, they must recognize 
their sins and renounce their error. If we then lack the 
gentleness of the Spirit, they may justly accuse us. 

(29) And he who carefully considers the words of the 
apostle sees clearly that he is not speaking of heresies 
or sins against doctrine, but of far lesser sins, into which 
aman falls not out of deliberate malice or willfulness, but 
out of weakness. Hence he uses such kind and fatherly 
words, calling it not an error or a sin, but a fault. Then, 
in order to make the sin small and, as it were, to excuse 
it, and to shift all the blame from man, he adds: "If aman 
were hasty," that is, deceived by the devil or by the flesh; 
and the word "man" also serves to make the matter 
small, as if he wanted to say: Surely what is so near to 
aman as that he should fall, be deceived, and err? Thus 
Moses says in the third book [Cap. 5, 3. according to the 
Vulgate], "As men are wont to sin." This, then, is an 
exceedingly comforting saying, which makes me

Interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. vin, 2786 fs. 731 





once in the highest emergency (certamine) from death. 

30 Because the saints in this life not only live in the 
flesh, but also sometimes, under the impulse of the devil, 
perform the lusts of the flesh, that is, fall into impatience, 
hatred, anger, error, doubt, distrust 2c. (For Satan 
constantly challenges both the purity of doctrine, which 
he seeks to abolish by mobs and discord, and the 
blameless walk of life, which he sullies by daily offenses 
and distractions), Paul teaches how to deal with those 
who have fallen, namely, that those who stand firm 
should restore them with a gentle spirit. 

It is very useful that those who are in charge of the 
churches know this, so that they do not forget this 
fatherly and motherly affection, which Paul demands 
from those who are responsible for the care of the souls, 
while they are trying to cut out everything completely 


purely (ad vivum resecare). And of this commandment of 
his he has given an example in the second letter to the 
Corinthians, Cap. 2, 6-8, where he says that it is enough 
that the banished man has been punished by many, now 
they must forgive him and comfort him, so that he does 
not fall into too much sadness, and says: "Therefore | 
admonish you that you show love to him" 2c. Therefore, 
the pastors are to punish harshly those who have fallen, 
but when they see that they have fallen into sadness, 
they are to begin to raise them up and comfort them, and 
to minimize their sins as much as they are able, but only 
by the mercy [of God] which they must oppose to the 
sins, so that the fallen may not be consumed by 
excessive sadness. As persistent as the Holy Spirit is 
when it comes to holding on to and defending the faith, 
as willing and kind is he to bear the sins and to make 
them small, if only those who have committed them 
suffer over them. 

(32) But here, as in all other things, the synagogue of 
the pope taught and did something quite different from 
what Paul commanded and showed by his example. The 
Roman pope and the bishops have been real tyrants and 
torturers of consciences, for they have continued to 
teach the same things. 


They have loaded the consciences with new statutes, 
and for the most trifling causes have cast them into 


perdition (perdiderunt), and in order that the consciences 
might the more easily obey their vain and unjust threats, 
they have cited these sayings of Pope Gregory: Pious 
hearts should fear guilt, even where there is no guilt; 
likewise: Our judgments are to be feared, even if they 
are unjust. By these sayings, which the devil brought into 
the church, they have strengthened the ban and the 
majesty of the papacy, which is terrible for the whole 
world. 

Such kindness is not necessary, but it is enough to 
acknowledge guilt where there is guilt. Who has given 
you, you Roman Satan, the power to frighten and 
condemn with unjust judgments the hearts that were 
frightened before, which should rather have been raised 
up, freed from false terrors, and led back from the lie to 
the truth? This you neglect and (as your title says: The 
man of sin and the child of perdition) invent guilt where 
there is no guilt. This is actually the cunning and deceit 
of the Antichrist, with which the pope has most 
powerfully strengthened the ban and his tyranny. For no 
one could despise his unjust judgments, unless he had 
been obdurate and particularly wicked, as some princes 
despised them, but against the testimony of their 
conscience, because in the darkness of that time they 
did not understand that the curses of the pope were void. 

(34) Therefore, those who are charged with the care 
of governing consciences may learn from this 
commandment of Paul how to treat the fallen. He says: 
"Dear brothers, if a man is overtaken by a fault," do not 
grieve or afflict him any more, do not reject or condemn 
him, but correct him, refresh him, or "restore him" (for 
this is what the Greek word means), and what is corrupt 
in him through the deceit of the devil or the weakness of 
the flesh, heal it by your gentleness. For the kingdom to 
which you have been called is not a kingdom of fear and 
sorrow, but of good confidence and joyfulness. 


732 Lri. "Al. Ill, 73-76. elabor. Explanation d. Galatians 6, 1. W. VIII, 2787-2798. 733 


lity. Therefore, if you see any brother who is frightened 
because of a sin he has committed, run and reach out 
to him who has fallen, comfort him with kind words and 
welcome him with motherly arms. But the hard and 
hardened, who without fear remain secure in their sins 
and continue, punish severely. On the other hand, those 
who are precipitated by error and grieve because of their 
fall must be raised up and instructed by you who are 
spiritual, with a gentle spirit, not with a spirit of zeal, 
justice or severity, as some confessors have done, who, 
when they should have refreshed thirsty hearts with 
sweet consolation, watered them with gall and vinegar, 
as the Jews did with Christ on the cross. 

(35) From this we understand sufficiently that the 
forgiveness of sins should not take place in doctrine, as 
the Sacramentans claim, but in that which concerns life 
and our works. Let no one condemn another, let no one 
rebuke with anger and severity, as Ezekiel says of the 
shepherds of Israel, that they ruled harshly and severely 
over the host of God, but let a brother comfort his fallen 
brother with a gentle spirit, and again, let the fallen one 
hear the word of the one who is delivering him, and 
believe him. For God does not want us to reject the 
brokenhearted, but to raise them up, as the Psalm [Ps. 
146:8] says, for he has offered more for them than we 
have, namely his life and his blood. Therefore, we too 
should receive such people with the utmost gentleness, 
heal them and help them. Therefore we do not deny 
grace to the Sacramentarians or to the founders of other 
godless sects, but will heartily forgive them their 
revilings and blasphemies against Christ, and never 
remember the insults with which they have heaped upon 
us, if they will only repent, give up the godless doctrine 
with which they have confused the churches of Christ, 
and thereafter walk with us in the right order. But if they 
persist in error and destroy the order, it is in vain that 
they demand forgiveness of sins from us. 





And look to yourself, lest you also be tempted. 

(36) This is a very serious admonition, to restrain the 
severity and hardness of those who do not lift up and 
help the fallen. St. Augustine says: "There is no sin that 
one man has committed that another could not commit. 
We are still walking on a slippery slope, therefore 
nothing happens more easily than that we fall, if we are 
arrogant and leave the right order. That is why he, in the 
biographies of the fathers, when he was told that one of 
the brethren had fallen into fornication, said correctly: 
"Yesterday that one, today |". 

37. So Paul adds this serious admonition, so that the 
pastors may not be harsh and rough with the fallen, nor, 
as the Pharisee does, measure their holiness by the sins 
of those people, but be moved by motherly affection 
toward them and think: This one has fallen, it can easily 
happen that you also do a much more dangerous and 
shameful fall than he; and if those who are so inclined 
to judge and condemn others would look at their sins 
rightly, they would realize that the sins of the fallen are 
splinters, but their sins are exceedingly great beams. 

38 "Therefore he that standeth may take heed that 
he fall not" [1 Cor. 10:12]. When David, such a holy man, 
full of faith and of the Spirit of God, and who had such 
glorious promises, and had led the greatest things for 
the Lord, falls so shamefully, and, since he was already 
quite advanced in years, is carried away by the heat of 
youth, after he had suffered so many and so manifold 
temptations, through which God exercised him, what 
would we be presumptuous about our steadfastness? 
But by such examples God shows us first of all our 
weakness, so that we do not rise up but stand in fear, 
secondly His judgment, which nothing can suffer less 
than hopefulness, whether against Him or against a 
brother. Paul therefore says not in vain, "And look to 
thyself, lest thou also be tempted." 

39. those who are exercised through temptations 
know, 


734 Li. Kai. il, 76-78. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. vill, 2795-2798. 


735 





how necessary this commandment is. On the other 
hand, those who are not tested by it do not understand 
Paul and are therefore not moved by compassion for the 
fallen, as could be seen in the papacy, where nothing 
but tyranny and cruelty prevailed. 


V. 2: Bear one another's burdens, and you will 
fulfill the law of Christ. 


40. a very kind (humanissimum) commandment, to 
which he added the highest praise, as it were, as a 


summa (epiphonema). The law of Christ is the law of 
love. After Christ redeemed us, renewed us and made 
us his church, he gave us no law except that we should 
love one another. John 13:34 says, "A new 
commandment | give unto you, that ye love one another, 
as | have loved you." Likewise [v. 35], "By this shall every 
man know that ye are my disciples. "2c. "To love," 
however, is not, as the sophists fool, to grant good to 
another, but to bear another's burden, that is, to bear 
that which is burdensome to you, and you do not like to 
bear. 

41 A Christian must therefore have strong shoulders 
and strong bones, which can bear the flesh, that is, the 
weakness of the brethren, for Paul says that they have 
burdens and burdensome things. Therefore love is kind, 
gracious, patient, not in taking but in giving. For it must 
overlook and bear with many things. In the church, godly 
teachers see many errors and sins that they must bear. 
In the worldly regime, the obedience of the subjects 
never corresponds to the laws of the authorities. If, 
therefore, a person in authority cannot overlook, he will 
not be competent to govern a community. In the 
household, many things happen that are displeasing to 
the head of the household. But if we can bear our 
infirmities and sins, of which we commit many daily, and 
overlook them very easily (egregie), let us also bear 
those of others, according to the word: "Bear one 
another's burdens" 2c.; likewise: "Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself." 

(42) Therefore, since there are infirmities in every 
state and in all men, Paul holds up to the Christians the 
law of Christ, by which 





He exhorts them to bear one another's burdens. Those 
who do not do this testify sufficiently that they do not 
understand even a shred of the law of Christ, which is 
the law of love, which, as Paul says in 1 Cor. 13:7, 
believes all things, hopes all things, bears all the burdens 
of the brethren, but always without prejudice to the first 
order. 1) Those who sin in this do not transgress the law 
of Christ, that is, love, do not violate their neighbor, but 
Christ and his kingdom, which he established by his own 
blood. This kingdom is not maintained by the law of love, 
but by the Word, faith and the Spirit. 

(43) Therefore, this commandment that we bear their 
burdens does not apply to those who deny Christ and not 
only do not recognize their sin, but also deny it; nor does 
it apply to those who persist in their sins (who also 
partially deny Christ), but they are to be let go, so that 
they will not be made partakers of their evil works. On 
the other hand, those who believe and gladly hear the 
word, and yet fall into sin against their will, and when they 
are admonished, not only hear, but abhor their sin, and 
strive to amend themselves, have been hurried, and 
have a burden which Paul commands us to bear. Here 
we are not to be unkind and severe, but after the 
example of Christ, who tolerates and bears such people, 
we also are to tolerate and bear them. If he does not 
punish such people, which he could justly do, much less 
should we do so 2c. 


V. 3 But if anyone lets himself think that he is 
something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 


44 Here he aims again at the authors of the mobs and 
paints them with their right colors, that they are hard and 
without any movement of mercy, because they despise 
the weak, do not bear their burdens, but (like some 
strange husbands and strict teachers) want to have 
everything according to the string. Nothing pleases them 
but what they themselves have done, and you will always 
make them your most bitter 


1) The "first order" is not to depart from the word of God and the 
faith, not to let up on it, and not to allow a deviation from it. 


736 ".N. Ill, 78--81. Executed. Explanation of Galatians 6, 3. 4. W. VIII, 2798-2800. 737 


You will have enemies if you do not approve of 
everything they say and do, and if you do not submit to 
their ways (moribus) in all things. So these are very 
hopeful people who dare to presume everything, that is, 
what Paul says here, they make themselves believe that 
they are something, that is, that they have the Spirit, that 
they understand all the mysteries of Scripture, that they 
cannot err and fall, that they do not need forgiveness of 
sins. 

45 Therefore Paul rightly adds that they do not 
celebrate anything, but deceive themselves with their 
foolish imaginations of their wisdom and _ holiness. 
Therefore they understand nothing of Christ nor of the 
law of Christ. Otherwise they would say: Dear brother, 
you suffer from this infirmity, | suffer from another. God 


has forgiven me ten thousand pounds (talentorum), | will 
also forgive you a hundred pennies 2c. But since they 
demand everything most severely and do not want to 
suffer and bear the burden of the weak, they annoy 
many by this harshness of theirs, who begin to despise 
them, to scorn and flee, not desiring advice and comfort 
from them, not caring about them, what they teach or 
how they teach it, whereas, on the contrary, pastors 
should behave toward the people over whom they 
preside in such a way as to honor and admire them, not 
for the sake of their person, but because of their office 
and their Christian virtues, which should shine forth most 
in them. Therefore, in this passage, Paul has beautifully 
painted such stern and unmerciful saints, saying, "They 
make themselves believe that they are something, that 
is, puffed up by their foolish delusions and vain dreams, 
they have a wonderfully high opinion of themselves 
about their knowledge and holiness, and yet in truth they 
are nothing, but only deceive themselves. For it is a 
manifest deception when someone is convinced that he 
is something, and yet he is nothing. Such people are 
described in the Revelation of John Cap. 3, 17. with 
these words: "You say, 'l am rich, and have plenty, and 
have no need,’ and do not know that you are wretched, 
miserable, poor, blind, and naked. 

But let every man examine his own work, and then 
he shall have glory in himself, and not in another. 





He continues to punish the despicable people called 
ambitious people. For covetousness for vain honor is a 
hateful and cursed vice, which gives rise to all evil, and 
at the same time confuses the government of the world 
and the conscience, and in spiritual matters it is a 
completely incurable evil. Although this passage could 
be understood in terms of works in life or walk, the 
apostle mainly emphasizes the work of preaching and 
attacks those who are ambitious. 
who confuse the rightly informed consciences with their 
enthusiastic opinions. 

(47) It is characteristic of those who suffer from vain 
honor that they do not care whether the work, that is, the 


direction of the ministry, is pure or not, but have only 
one thing in mind, that they may win the applause of the 
people. This is what the false apostles did. When they 
saw that Paul had preached the gospel purely to the 
Galatians, and that they could come up with nothing 
better, they began to slander what he had taught rightly 
and godly, preferring their teaching to Paul's, and by this 
art they put themselves in favor with the Galatians and 
made Paul hateful to them. 

(48) Therefore, those who are avaricious of vain 
honor have these three vices combined: first, they are 
extremely eager for vain honor; second, they are 
wonderfully skilled in slandering what others speak and 
do rightly in order to gain popular acclaim; third, when 
they have become famous among the great multitude, 
but at other people's expense and risk, they become so 
brave and courageous that there is nothing they should 
not dare to do. So they are harmful and curse-worthy 


people, whom | hate in the strongest possible way (cane 


pejus et angue). For they seek what is theirs, not what is 
Christ's. 

49 Against such people Paul acts here as if he 
wanted to say: Such ambitious people direct their work 
for the purpose, that is, to teach the gospel, so that they 
may gain honor and acclaim among men, that is, that 
they may be praised by them as excellent and splendid 
teachers, with whom Paul and others may compare 


738 Lyi. 6si. Ill, 81-83. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2800-2804. 


739 





could not endure. As soon as they have gained this 
reputation, they begin to slander what others have 
worked, said and done, and to praise their own 
gloriously; And by this cunning they beguile the hearts of 
the mob, who, because their ears itch, not only delight in 
new doctrines, but also take pleasure in seeing those 
whom they had before for teachers eclipsed and 
oppressed by these new delicious (as they dream) 
teachers, because they are weary of the word and 
disgusted with it. 

50 This, he says, should not be, but let each one be 
faithful in his office, not seeking his own honor, nor 


trusting in the great multitude, which carelessly (temere) 
gives applause, but only let it be his concern that he may 
carry out his office honestly, that is, teach the gospel 
purely. If his work is done rightly, he should know that he 
will not lack honor with God, nor with the godly. The fact 
that in the meantime he cannot earn praise from the 
ungrateful world should not move him. For he knows that 
this is the purpose of his ministry, not that he, but that 
Christ may be glorified through it. Therefore, armed with 
weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left, he 
should speak with a steady mind: | did not begin to teach 
the gospel in order that the world should show me honor, 
therefore | will not desist from it because of the shame it 
does to me. Such a one teaches the word and directs his 
ministry without any regard for men, without caring in any 
way for praise, honor, power, wisdom 2c. He does not 
rely on the praise of others, but has it with himself. 

51 Therefore, he who administers his ministry rightly 
and faithfully does not care what the world says about 
him, he does not care if it praises or blames him, but has 
his glory in himself, which is the testimony of his 
conscience and the glory before God, and therefore he 
can speak with Paul [2 Cor. 1, 12]: "Our glory is this, that 
is, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and 
godly integrity, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of 
God, we are built up in the faith of God. 





of this world" 2c. This glory is pure and lasting, because 
it does not depend on the judgment of others, but on our 
own conscience, which gives us the testimony that we 
have taught rightly, administered the sacraments rightly, 
and done everything rightly, therefore it cannot be 
stained or taken away. 

The other honor that the ambitious have is an 
uncertain and extremely dangerous honor, for they do 
not have it in themselves, but it depends on the speech 
and opinions of the great crowd, and therefore they 
cannot have the testimony of their own conscience that 
they have done everything out of a simple and pure 
heart, only to praise the glory of God and to promote the 
blessedness of souls. For they seek only that they 
themselves may become famous and praised by men 
through the work or labor of preaching. Thus they have 
an honor, a confidence, and a testimony, but with men, 
not with themselves nor with God. In this way, the godly 
do not desire to have honor. If Paul had had praise and 
honor with men and not with himself, he would have 
despaired when he saw that many cities, countries and 
all of Asia were falling away from him, when he saw that 
so many arouses and mobs followed his preaching. 
Since Christ was alone, that is, since the Jews were not 
the only ones who sought to put him to death, since he 
was abandoned by his disciples, he was not alone, but 
the Father was with him, because he had his glory in 
himself. 

Likewise, if today our confidence and honor 
depended on the judgment and favor of men, we would 
soon perish with sadness of heart. For there is so much 
lacking that the papists, the enthusiasts and the whole 
world should consider us worthy of any honor and 
praise, that they even hate and persecute us most 
bitterly, yes, they would like to blaspheme our ministry 
and our doctrine to the utmost and exterminate them 
completely. So we have nothing among men but pure 
shame. But we are joyful and glory in the Lord. 
Therefore, with the greatest faithfulness and care, we 
safely and cheerfully administer the ministry in which 
God has placed us, which we know is good for Him.

be pleasing. Since we do this, we do not care whether 
the devil likes or dislikes our work, whether the world is 


favorable to us or hates us. For since we know that our 


work is honestly directed, and we have a good 
conscience before God, we walk in righteousness, 
through honor and dishonor, through shame and praise 
2c. This is what Paul calls "having glory in oneself". 

(54) And this is a very necessary admonition against 
this very harmful vice, because the gospel is such a 
doctrine, which by its nature, and then also by the 
wickedness of Satan, brings with it the cross. Therefore 
Paul used to call it a word of the cross and of offense [1 


Cor. 1:18, 23]. It has not constant steadfast disciples, but 
also those 1) who today come and confess it, but 


tomorrow, vexed by the cross, again fall away and deny 
it. Therefore, those who teach the gospel in order to gain 


(56) Therefore, says Paul, if you are eager for glory, 
seek it in a right way and in such a way that it endures, 
not that it is based on the speech of others, but that it is 
in your heart. This will happen if you do your work 
honestly. In this way it will also be found that the honor 
you have with yourselves will finally be followed by honor 
with others. But if you have glory only in others and not 
in yourselves, then the shame and dishonor that you 
have inwardly in your heart will also be followed by 
outward dishonor in others. We have seen this in our time 
in the case of some fanatics who did not check their work, 
that is, did not take care that they taught the gospel 
purely, but misused it so that they received the applause 
of the great crowd, contrary to the second 
commandment, and therefore their inward disgrace was 
also followed by outward disgrace, according to the 


applause and praise from the people must necessarily words [2 Mos. 20:7], "The Lord will not leave him 
perish and their honor be disgraced if the people cease|unpunished who takes His name in vain," and likewise [1

not have his glory in the mouth of others, but in himself. 


If we first seek the honor of God through the service 


If there are some who praise him, as the truly godly are jof the Word, our honor will surely follow, according to the 


wont to do ("by honor and dishonor" says Paul [2 Cor. 
6:8]), let him accept this honor, but as something 
incidental to the right honor (accidens). But for the right, 


essential honor (Substantiam gloriae) he should hol 
the testimony of his conscience. He then examines hi 
own work, that is, he is not concerned about his hono 
and has only one thing in mind, that he may conduct hi 
ministry honestly, that is, that he may teach the Gospel 
purely and show the right use of the sacraments to th 
people 2c. Since he thus examines his work, he has glo’ 
in himself, which no one can snatch from him, becaus 
he has planted it well in his heart, fixed it and kept it, no 
by the speech of others, which Satan can easily tur 
away, and make of their mouth and tongue, which shortl 
before spoke well of him, such a one as reviles him mos 
grievously.

saying: "Whoever honors me, | will also honor. In short, 
let every one examine, that is, let it be diligently applied 
to him that his service may be faithful, for this is required 
above all things of the ministers of the word, 1 Cor. 4:2, 
as if to say: Everyone seeks to accomplish this one thing, 
that he teach the word purely and faithfully, looking to 
nothing but the glory of God and the salvation of souls, 
then his work is faithful and well founded, and he has 
honor in his conscience, namely, that he can confidently 
say: This teaching and my ministry is pleasing to God, 
which is truly an excellent and delicious glory 2c. 

58. But this saying can also be applied appropriately 
to the works that the godly do in any profession, as if he 
who is a person in authority, a householder, a servant, a 
schoolteacher, a pupil, 2c., were to remain in his 
profession and carry out his office in it honestly and 
faithfully, and not worry about the works that are not in 
his profession. He who does this has glory in himself. For 
he can say, 


742 


Li-1. 6ai. Ill, 86-88. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. viii, 2807-2810. 


743 





| have carried out the work of the profession that God 
commanded me to do as faithfully and diligently as | 
could, so | know that this work, which is done in faith and 
obedience to God, is pleasing to God. If others slander 
it, it is of little consequence. For there are always people 
who despise and slander the teaching and life of the 
godly. But God has seriously threatened that He will put 
the slanderers to shame. Therefore, since such people 
anxiously pursue vain honor for a long time, and seek to 
put the truly godly in the shade by their slander, what 
Paul said [Phil. 3, 19.] befalls them:. "Whose honor will 
be put to shame," and in another place [2 Tun. 3, 9.]: 
"Their foolishness will be revealed to everyone." By 
whom? Through GOD, the righteous judge, who, as He 
will put the slander of those people in the pillory, so will 
bring forth the righteousness of the godly as the 
noonday, Ps. 37, 6. 

The word "in itself," in order to mention this in 
passing, must be taken in such a way that one does not 
exclude God, namely, that each one should know that 
his work, in whatever godly state he may be, is a divine 
work, because it is a work of a divine profession, which 
has God's command. 


V. 5 For every man shall bear his own burden. 


(60) This is, as it were, the reason (ratio) for the 
previous saying, that no one should base himself on the 
judgment of others about him, as if to say, "It is utter folly 
that you seek glory in others and not in yourself. For in 
the battle of death and in the last judgment it will be of 
no use to you that others have praised you, for others 
will not bear your burden, but you will stand before the 
judgment seat of Christ and bear your burden alone. 
There your praisers will not be able to help you. For 
when we die, these voices of praise will cease, and on 
that day when the Lord will judge the hidden things of 
men, 2) the testimony of the Lord will not be heard. 


1) Instead of the following to the end of the paragraph, Menius 
has introduced other thoughts,

according to Rom. 2, 16. 





knowledge either for you or against you. Against you, if 
you have glory in others; for you, if you have glory in 
yourself, that is, if your conscience gives you testimony 
that you have administered the ministry of the word 
honestly and faithfully, looking only to the glory of God 
and the salvation of souls, or have directed your ministry 
rightly, as your profession requires. 

61 And those words [v. 2], "Bear one another's 
burdens," are mighty words, so that they should certainly 
frighten us, lest we be stingy with vain honor. 

(62) It should also be noted that we are not dealing 
here with the article of justification, where nothing is valid 
but pure grace and forgiveness of sins, which is taken 
by faith alone, where all works, even those that are the 
best and done according to the divine calling, need 
forgiveness of sins because we do not do them fully; but 
here we are dealing with a different matter. For Paul 
does not speak here of the forgiveness of sins, but holds 
up right and hypocritical works against one another. 
Therefore this is to be understood in such a way that, 
although the work or ministry of a godly pastor is not so 
perfect that it should not need the forgiveness of sins, it 
is nevertheless righteous and perfect in itself, if it is held 
against the work of those who are stingy with vain honor. 

Thus, our preaching ministry is righteous and 
endures because we seek the glory of God and the 
salvation of souls. On the other hand, that of the spirits 
is not such, because they seek their own glory. 
Therefore, although no work can satisfy the conscience 
before God, it is necessary that we can be certain that 
we have done our work in purity, truth and in a godly 
profession, that is, that we have not corrupted God's 
word, but have taught it purely. 2c. This testimony of 
conscience, that we have administered our preaching 
ministry correctly and have led a Christian life, is 
necessary for us. So far we may boast of our works, as 
far as we know that they are approved by God and 
pleasing to Him. For each one will bear his burden in the 
last judgment, therefore others who praise us will be of 
no use to us there.

745 





Up to this point he has attacked the extremely 
harmful vice of vain honor; no one is so capable of 
rejecting it that he does not need constant prayer to do 
so. For what man, even if he is godly, does not delight 
in the praise that is bestowed upon him? Only the Holy 
Spirit can protect us from being infected by this plague. 


V. 6 But he that is instructed in the word divideth 
all good things to him that instructeth him. 


Here he preaches to the disciples or hearers of the 
word that they should give all kinds of good things to 
their teachers. In the past, | often wondered why the 


apostle so diligently commanded the churches to feed 
their teachers. For | saw in the papacy that all gave 
everything with wonderful generosity to build 
magnificent churches, to make the salaries large and to 
increase the income of those who were in the spiritual 


state (qui sacra tractabant). Therefore the dignity and the 
wealth of the bishops and other clergymen grew in such 
a way that they possessed everywhere the most 


beautiful (cultissimas) and best lands. | therefore 
thought that Paul had commanded this in vain, since all 
kinds of good things were not only given to the clergy 
superfluously, but also flowed abundantly, and therefore 
| thought that people should rather be admonished so 
that they do not give more, than admonished so that they 
should give. For | saw that through this excessive 
generosity of the people the stinginess of the clergy 
grew 2c. But now we see the reason why they used to 
have an abundance of all goods, but now the pastors 
and ministers of the word are starving 2c. 

In the past, when false and ungodly things were taught, 
everything flowed so superfluously that from the 
patrimony (patrimonio) of Peter (who says that he has 
neither silver nor gold) and from the so-called spiritual 
goods the pope became an emperor, cardinals and 
bishops 2c. Kings and princes of the world have 
become. But now that they have begun to teach the 
Gospel, its preachers (professores) are as rich as once 
Christ and the apostles were. So we learn how well this 
commandment has been fulfilled. 





that one should feed the teachers of the Word, which 
Paul so diligently urges and inculcates in the hearers 
here and elsewhere. 

67. Now there is no city, at least as far as we know, 
which feeds its teachers itself, but all have their 
sustenance from the goods, not which Christ, for to him 
no one gives anything (for at his birth he uses the 
manger instead of a bed, since he has no room in the 
inn; When he walks on earth, he has no place to lay his 
head; finally, he is stripped of his clothes and dies in the 
most miserable way, hanging naked on the cross 
between two murderers), but which were given to the 
pope for fine abominations, because, after the gospel 
was suppressed, he taught human statutes and 
established ungodly services. 

68 And as often as | read Paul's exhortations, in 
which he preaches to the churches both that they should 
feed their teachers and that they should contribute 
something to the lack of the saints in Judea, | tend to be 
very surprised and filled with shame that such a great 
apostle had to use so many words to obtain this benefit 
from the churches. In the second letter to the Corinthians 
he deals with this matter in two whole chapters [Cap. 8 
and | would not like to bring Wittenberg, which is nothing 
at all against Corinth, into such a bad reputation as he 


did to the Corinthians by such urgent (anxia) and 
distressed begging for the livelihood of the poor. But this 
is the fate of the Gospel when it is taught, not only does 
no one want to give anything to feed the servants of it 
and to maintain schools, but all begin to rob, steal, cheat 
each other with various artifices, in short, people 
suddenly seem to degenerate into abominable beasts. 
On the other hand, when the doctrines of the devils are 
preached, people become very extravagant and willingly 
offer everything to their seducers. The prophets also 
accuse the Jews of the same sin, that they hardly gave 
the godly priests and Levites a living, but gave everything 
in abundance to the godless ones.

747 





69 Therefore, only now do we understand how 
necessary Paul's commandment is that the servants of 
the churches should be fed. For Satan can suffer nothing 
less than the light of the gospel. Therefore, when it 
shines, he flares up and tries to extinguish it with all his 
might, and tries to do so in two ways: first, by lies of the 
heretics and force of arms of the tyrants, then by lack 
and hunger. But since, by the grace of God, he has not 
been able to suppress the gospel in our lands through 
heretics and tyrants, he seeks to do so in another way, 
namely, by depriving the ministers of the word of food, 
so that they, forced by lack and hunger, may leave the 
ministry of preaching, and thus, in time, the wretched 
people, deprived of the word, will become completely 
cattle. And in order that this most terrible evil may come 


all the more swiftly, Satan hastens (urget) it greatly 
through godless authorities in the cities and the nobles 
in the countryside, who steal the church goods, on which 
the ministers of the Gospel should live, and use them for 
an evil custom. The prophet Micah says [Cap. 1, 7.], "Of 
whoredoms they are gathered, and shall become 
whoredoms again." 

Then Satan leads men away from the gospel, even 

the good ones, individually (privately) through excessive 
satiety. For the diligent and daily practice of the Word 
produces in many a disgust and contempt for it, who 
then gradually become negligent in the practice of all the 
duties of godliness. Likewise, no one now gives his 
children to the study of good sciences, much less the 
Scriptures, but only to profitable arts. All this the devil 
does for the purpose of suppressing the gospel in our 
lands, even without the violence of tyrants and the wiles 
of heretics. 
So it is not for nothing that Paul exhorts the hearers of 
the Word to share all kinds of good things with their 
teachers. In the first letter to the Corinthians [Cap. 9, 11] 
he says: "If we sow spiritual things to you, is it a great 
thing if we reap your bodily things?" So the hearers must 
serve those with their bodily goods from whom they have 
received the spiritual. But farmers, citizens 





and noblemen today abuse our teachings only to 
accumulate wealth. 

Before, when the pope reigned, there was no one 
who did not pay the priests annually for the so-called 


anniversariis, likewise for masses, vigils 2c. The 
mendicant monks also received their share. Thus the 
Roman fair [with the indulgence] and the daily sacrifices 
also took away something considerable 2c. From these 
and other innumerable extortions our people are freed 
by the gospel. But so much is lacking in them that they 
should be thankful for this freedom, that they have 
become outright thieves and robbers from profligate 
people, who give neither to the Gospel, nor to its 
servants, nor to the poor saints even a farthing. This is a 
sure sign that they have already lost the Word and the 
faith, and in short, have nothing of spiritual goods, 
because it is impossible for truly godly people to admit 
that their ministers are lacking. But because nowadays 
they rejoice and laugh when their ministers suffer 
adversities, and deny them their sustenance, or do not 
give as faithfully as they should, it is certain that they are 
worse than heathens. 

But what misfortune will follow this ingratitude, they 
will experience in a short time. For they will lose both the 
physical and the spiritual. For this sin must necessarily 
be followed by the most severe punishments, and | truly 
believe that the churches in Galatia, Corinth 2c. have 
been so destroyed by the false apostles for no other 
reason than because they neglected their true teachers. 
It is quite right that he who denies a penny to God, who 
offers him all good things and eternal life, should give a 
gold florin to the devil, from whom all evil and death 
come. He who does not want to serve God in a small 
matter 1) to his greatest benefit, let him serve the devil 
in the greatest matter to his greatest harm. Now that the 
word shines, we see what the devil and the world are.

749 








But that he says: "All kinds of good things" (in 


omnibus bonis), this is not to be understood in such a 
way that everyone should share all his goods with his 
teachers, but that they should feed them abundantly 


(liberaliter), as much as is enough to maintain life in a 


sufficient way (commode). The word KATHYOVILEVOG is 
used to those 
known, who understand the Greek. 


V. 7. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. 


The apostle is so serious about this doctrine of 
feeding the teachers that he adds a threat to his rebuke 


(increpationi) and admonition, saying: "God is not 
mocked. But he has exactly met the manner of ours, who 
certainly despise our preaching ministry. For they think it 
is a joke or a game, and therefore they (especially the 
nobles) deal with it by subjugating their parish lords as if 
they were lowly slaves, and if we did not have such a 
godly prince who loves the truth, they would have driven 
us out of these lands long ago. They cry out (when the 
parish priests demand their pay or complain that they are 
in want): The priests are stingy; they want to have an 
abundance of all goods; no one can satisfy their 
insatiable avarice. If they were truly evangelical, they 
should have nothing of their own, but as poor follow the 
poor Christ and suffer every hardship 2c. 

To such tyrants and mockers of God, who with the 
greatest certainty ridicule the poor pastors, and yet want 
to be considered evangelical, and that they do not mock 
God, but serve Him with the greatest reverence, Paul 
threatens here in a frightening manner. He says: "Do not 
be mistaken, God does not allow Himself to be mocked", 
that is, He does not suffer Him to be mocked in His 
servants. Christ says [Luc. 10, 16.]: "Whoever despises 
you despises me", and to Samuel [1 Sam. 8, 7.] God 
says: "They have not rejected you, but me" 2c. 
Therefore, even though He may postpone vengeance for 
a time, in His time He will find you and punish the 
contempt of His word and your exceedingly bitter hatred 
of His servants. Therefore, you are not deceiving God, 
but 





yourselves. You will not laugh at God, but God will laugh 
at you [Ps. 2:4]. And the verse: Non me doctorem, sed te 


deluseris ipsum [If you deceive the teacher, you have 
deceived yourself] is well known. 

But the defiant nobility, burghers and peasants are 
not moved at all by this terrifying threat, but they will 
realize, when the need for death is present, whether they 
have mocked us (yes, not us, but as Paul says here, God 
Himself) or themselves. Meanwhile we say this, because 
they arrogantly despise our admonitions, for our comfort, 
that we should know it is better to suffer wrong than to 


do wrong. For he who suffers (patientia) is always 
innocent. Furthermore, God will not let us, his servants, 
die of hunger, but when the rich are starving and hungry, 
he will feed us, and in the days of famine he will satisfy 
us. 


For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 


78 All this belongs to the doctrine (locum) of the 
maintenance of preachers. | do not like to interpret such 
sayings. For they seem to boast us, as indeed they boast 
us. Then it has an appearance of avarice when one tries 
to impress this on the listeners with great diligence. But 
people must be taught about this too, so that they know 
that they owe reverence and sustenance to their 
teachers. Christ teaches the same, Luc. 10, 7. by saying, 
"Eat and drink what they have, for a laborer is worth his 
wages." And Paul in another place [1 Cor. 9:13, 14], 
"Know ye not that they which sacrifice eat of the 
sacrifice? And they that minister of the altar, enjoy of the 
altar? So also the LORD commanded that they which 
preach the gospel should feed of the gospel." 

It is also useful for us, who are in the ministry of 
preaching, to know this, so that we do not take the wages 
for our work, which are paid to us from the goods of the 
pope, with an evil conscience. Although these are 
gathered together by pure fraud, God, by depriving the 
Egyptians, that is, the papists, of their goods, 
nevertheless sets them up in our countries for my godly 
and good use, not when the nobles steal and abuse 
them, but when they are used by the pope. 


, 750 Ari. 6ai. Ill, 95-97. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIil, 2822-2825. 


if those who proclaim God's glory and teach the youth 
godly are fed by it. For it is impossible for a person to 
have time for domestic work day and night in order to 
earn a living, and at the same time to study the Holy 
Scriptures diligently, as the office of a teacher requires. 
Therefore we should know that we can enjoy with a good 
conscience the goods (for God has commanded and 
ordained this) which are presented to us from the church 


goods in order to maintain our life sufficiently (commode), 
so that we have time for our ministry. Therefore, no one 
should make a conscience about it, as if he were not 
allowed to use these goods. 


V. 8 He who sows to the flesh will reap corruption 
from the flesh. But he that soweth to the Spirit shall 
of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 


80 He adds a simile and a figurative speech. But he 
applies this general saying about sowing to the particular 
matter of feeding the preachers, saying, "He who sows 
to the Spirit," that is, who gives the teachers of the Word 
their sustenance, is doing a spiritual work, and "will reap 
eternal life." Here one would like to ask whether we earn 
eternal life by good works, for it seems that Paul is 
asserting this here. Of the sayings that speak of works 
and reward, we have dealt diligently and abundantly 
enough above in the fifth 1) chapter. But it is highly 
necessary that, following Paul's example, believers be 
exhorted to do good, that is, to exercise their faith in good 
works. For if these do not follow faith, it is a sure sign that 
faith is not true faith. 

The apostle says: "Whoever sows to the flesh" (some 
read: "to his flesh"), that is, whoever does not share 
anything with the servants of the Word, but only feeds 
and provides for himself (to which the flesh drives), "will 
reap destruction from the flesh", not only in the life to 
come, but also in the present. For the goods of the 
wicked perish, and at last they themselves come to a 
shameful end.

751 


Wise at 2c. The apostle wanted to admonish his listeners 
to be generous and charitable to their teachers. But it is 
a very unfortunate thing that the "wickedness and 
ingratitude" of men is so great that it is necessary to do 
this in the churches. 

The Encratites have misused this saying to confirm 
their enthusiastic opinion against marriage and have 
interpreted it in this way: He who sows to the flesh shall 
reap corruption, that is, he who takes a wife shall be 
damned. So a woman is something damnable and 
marriage is evil because in it sowing to the flesh takes 
place. Those shameful beasts had so little judgment that 
they did not see what the apostle was talking about. | 
mention this for this reason, so that you may see that the 
devil can very easily turn simple hearts away from the 
truth through his servants. Germany will have 
innumerable such people in a short time, yes, it already 
has many, because in some places it persecutes and 
kills the godly, in other places it neglects them and lets 
them live in the greatest lack. Against these and similar 
errors we want to fortify ourselves and learn to grasp the 
right understanding of the Scriptures. But Paul, as every 
man of sound mind can see, speaks not of marriage, but 
of the entertainment of the ministers of the church, and 
though this entertainment is a bodily thing, yet he calls it 
"sowing to the spirit, On the other hand, he calls 
gathering together and seeking one's own: "sowing to 
the flesh". Of those he proclaims that they will be blessed 
in this life and in the life to come, of these, on the other 
hand, that they will be cursed in this life and in the life to 
come. 


V. 9 But let us do good and not grow weary, for in 
his time we will also reap without ceasing. 


When he concludes the letter, he moves from the 
specific to the general, exhorting to all good works in 
general, as if to say: Not only toward the ministers of the 
word, but also toward all men, let us be generous and 
charitable, and that without weariness.

W. VIIl, 2825-2829. 





For it is easy to do good once or twice, but to persevere 
and not be overcome by the ingratitude or malice of 
those to whom one has done good, that is trouble, that 
is need. Therefore he not only exhorts us to do good, but 
also not to grow weary in doing good, and in order to 
persuade us all the more easily, he adds: "For in his time 


we will also reap without growing weary" (non defatigati), 
as if he wanted to say: "Look on and expect a harvest 
without ceasing, which will come, then no ingratitude or 
malice of men will be able to keep you from doing good, 
for in the time of harvest you will obtain abundant fruit 
from your sowing. Thus he exhorts the faithful with the 
sweetest words to do good. 


V. 10: Now that we have time, let us do good to 
everyone, but most of all to our fellow believers. 


- This is the end of the exhortation to give generously to 
the church servants for their sustenance, and to give 
abundantly to all who are in need, as if to say: Let us do 
good while it is day, for when night comes we can work 
no more. When the light of truth is gone, people do many 
things, but in vain, because they walk in darkness and 
do not know where they are going. Therefore, their whole 
life, works, suffering and death is in vain. But covertly he 
aims these words at the Galatians, as if to say: If ye 
abide not in the wholesome doctrine which ye have 
received of me, it profiteth you nothing that ye do many 
good works, suffer many things 2c. Thus he says above 
Cap. 3, 4: "Have ye then suffered so much in vain?" 
But "comrades in the faith" he calls with a new 


expression (phrasi) those who are in our faith 
community, among whom are first the ministers of the 
Word, then also all other believers. 

V. 11. Behold, with how many words have I 
written to you with my own hand! 


86 He closes the epistle with an exhortation to his own 
and with a severe rebuke. 





Or an attack on the false apostles. "Behold," he says, 
"with how many words have | written unto you with mine 
own hand!" This he says to move them, and to show 
them his motherly affection which he has toward them, 
as if to say: Never have | written to another church with 
my own hand a letter containing so many words as | have 
written to you. For he dictated the others and only signed 
the greeting and his name with his own hand, as can be 
seen at the end of his epistles. In these words, however, 
he has the length of this epistle in mind, as | believe; but 
others interpret it differently. 


V. 12. Those who want to make themselves 
pleasing according to the flesh force you to 
circumcise, only that they may not be persecuted with 
the cross of Christ. 


Above he had cursed the false apostles and declared 


them to be banished people (anathema fecerat). Now, 
repeating the same thing, as it were, but in different 
words, he again accuses them severely in order to deter 
and draw the Galatians away from their teaching, 
however much they had the reputation of being people 
of great importance. He says, "You have such teachers 
who, first, do not care for the glory of Christ and the 
blessedness of your souls, but seek only their glory; 
second, flee the cross; third, do not understand, much 
less do, what they teach. 

If someone, especially an apostle, praised a teacher 
for these three virtues, he should be shunned by all; but 
not all Galatians obeyed Paul's admonition. Also, Paul 
does not disgrace the false apostles by attacking them 
so harshly, but he pronounces their sentence by 
apostolic authority. Thus, when we call the pope the 
antichrist and say that the bishops and the spirits are 


cursed people (anathema), we do not revile them, but 
judge by divine authority that they are cursed, according 
to this word [Gal. 1:8]: "So are we, or an angel from 
heaven," 2c. because they follow the teaching of Christ, 
but these overthrow it.

give by "well-doers, to put themselves in fine taste". 
Their first virtue, he says, is that they flatter the nobles 


(magnatibus) and the high priests. In order that they may 
make themselves agreeable to them, and that they 
themselves may preserve their honor unharmed, they 
compel you to be circumcised. For the nobles among the 
Jews stubbornly resist the gospel and defend Moses. 
They strive to submit to the will of these people and to 
live outwardly in such a way and to arrange the behavior 


(gestus) in such a way that they please them. Therefore, 
in order to remain in grace with them and not to suffer 
the persecution of the cross, they teach that 
circumcision is necessary for salvation. 


90 There are also some such sycophants today, who 
cry out against us to please the pope, the bishops, and 
the princes, and maliciously slander our writings, not for 
the love of the truth, to protect it, which they dispute and 
blaspheme against their conscience, but to please their 
idols, the pope, the bishops, the kings and princes of the 
world, and also not to suffer the persecution of the cross 
of Christ. But if they would have those carnal benefits 
from the gospel that they have from their idols, likewise, 
if the confession of the gospel would bring wealth, 
pleasure, peace, and carnal rest, they would 
immediately come to us. 

(91) Paul says that your teachers are utterly 


worthless (vallissimi) people who care nothing for the 
glory of Christ and your salvation, but seek only their 
own glory. Then, because they fear the cross, they 
preach circumcision and the righteousness of the flesh, 
lest they incur the hatred and persecution of the Jews. 
Therefore, even though you hear them with great zeal 
for a long time, you still hear only such people who serve 
the belly, seek their honor and flee the cross. 

(92) But there is an emphasis on the word "compel. 
For circumcision is nothing, but if circumcision is 
compelled and righteousness and satisfaction [for sin] 
are made from receiving it, on the other hand, if it is 
neglected, sin is made, that is, dishonor to Christ. 
Enough has been said about this above. 





V.13. For even they themselves, who are 
circumcised, do not keep the law; but they desire that 
ye should be circumcised, that they may glory in your 
flesh. 

Here Paul is a heretic because he says that the false 
apostles and all the people of the Jews, who were 
circumcised, do not keep the law, even that the 
circumcised, when they fulfill the law, do not fulfill it. This 
is contrary to Moses, who says: if one is circumcised, he 
keeps the law; if one is not circumcised, he forsakes the 
covenant of God, Gen. 17:10, 14, and the Jews were 
circumcised for no other reason than to keep the law, 
which commanded that everything male should be 
circumcised on the eighth day 2c. This has been 
abundantly covered above, so there is no need to repeat 
it here. 

94 This is why he condemns the false apostles, so 
that he may deter the Galatians and they may not hear 
them, as if to say, "Behold, | paint before your eyes and 
show you what kind of teachers you have, first, people 
who are greedy for vain honor, who seek only their own 
and provide for their bellies; second, who flee from the 
cross; finally, who teach nothing that is true or certain, 
but all their speaking and doing is hypocritical. 
Therefore, even if they outwardly keep the law with 
gestures and ceremonies, they do not keep it by keeping 
it. For the law cannot be fulfilled without the Holy Spirit. 
Without Christ, however, one cannot receive the Holy 
Spirit; where this is not received, there remains an 
unclean spirit, that is, one who despises God and seeks 
his own glory. Therefore, everything he does from the 
law is hypocritical and a twofold sin. For an unclean heart 
does not fulfill the law, but only pretends outwardly that 
it fulfills the law, and is thus strengthened even more in 
its ungodliness and hypocrisy. 

95 This saying is well to be remembered, "They that 
are circumcised keep not the law," that is, the 
circumcised are not circumcised 2c. and it may be 
applied to other works also. Whoever does works apart 
from Christ, prays, suffers, does works in vain, prays and 
suffers in vain 2c., for "whatsoever is not of faith is sin". 


756 Drl- Oai. Ill, 102-105. Exec. Explanation d. Galatians 6, 13. 14. w. vm, 2833-2836. 


757 





[It is therefore of no use that someone is circumcised by 
heart, fasts, prays 2c., if he nevertheless inwardly 
remains a despiser of grace, of the forgiveness of sins, 
of faith, of Christ 2c., and is proud in trusting in himself, 
and is presumptuous because of his own righteousness, 
which are terrible sins against the first table. In addition 
to this, sins against the second table also arise, such as 
disobedience, lust, anger, wrath, hatred 2c. So he says 
rightly: The circumcised do not keep the law, but only 
pretend and give themselves the appearance of keeping 
it. But hypocrisy is a twofold sin before God. 

(96) What do the false apostles mean by wanting you 
to be circumcised? They want you to be circumcised, not 
so that you will be righteous, although they pretend to be, 
but "so that they may boast of your flesh. But who should 
not utterly abhor that exceedingly injurious vice, 
ambition, or the seeking of glory, which is sought after 
with so great danger of souls? They are, he says, quite 
worthless people who serve the belly and hate the cross. 
Then, what is most serious, they force you to be 
circumcised according to the law, so that they can abuse 
your flesh for their glory, to the eternal harm of your 
souls. For the benefit that you receive from this is your 
condemnation before God, before the world, so that the 
false apostles can boast that they are your teachers, but 
you are their disciples; but they teach you what they 
themselves do not do. In this way he makes the false 
apostles odious and hateful enough [to the Galatians]. 

97 These words, "That they may boast of your flesh," 
are to be read emphatically, as if to say, "They have not 
the word of the Spirit, therefore it is impossible for you to 
receive the Spirit from their preaching. They only 
exercise your flesh, making carnal works saints of you, 
who outwardly, without the Spirit, had days, times, 
sacrifices 2c. according to the law. These are purely 
carnal things, from which you have nothing but useless 
toil and condemnation. They, on the other hand, have 
this, that they can boast that they are teachers of the 
Galatians, whom they have removed from the doctrine of 
the heretic 


They would have brought St. Paul back to the mother, 
the synagogue. Thus the flatterers of the papists boast 
today that they bring back into the fold of the church 
those whom they traffic in. We, on the other hand, do not 
boast of your flesh, but of your spirit, because you have 
received the spirit from our preaching, as was said above 
Cap. 3, 2. 


V. 14. But let it be far from me to boast, but only 
of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. 


The apostle is now quite indignant and breaks out of 
an agitated mind into these words: "But let it be far from 
me to boast," 2c. as if he wanted to say: "The carnal 
boasting of the false apostles is such a harmful 
pestilence that | would like it to be buried in hell, because 
it brings ruin to many. But let him of the flesh boast who 
will, and perish with his accursed glory. But let this be my 
only glory, which is to glory in the cross of Christ. In the 
same way he also speaks Rom. 5, 3: "We boast of 
tribulations" 2c.; likewise 2 Cor. 12, 9: "I will most gladly 
boast of my weakness" 2c. So Paul shows here which is 
the right glory of Christians, namely that they boast, 
rejoice and are proud in tribulations, shame, weakness 
2c. 

The betting world judges that Christians are not only 
the most despicable people, but also hates them bitterly, 
as it should, out of a just zeal; it persecutes, condemns, 
and kills them as if they were the most harmful ruin for 
the spiritual and temporal kingdoms, that is, as heretics 
and rebels. But because they suffer these things, not for 
murder, theft and other such crimes, but for the sake of 
Christ, whose glory and honor they proclaim, they boast 
in the tribulation and cross of Christ and rejoice with the 
apostles that they are counted worthy to suffer reproach 
1) for the name of Christ [Acts 5:41]. 

100 So too, today, when the pope and the whole race 
are persecuting us, we should be gray. 


1) In the Jena and Erlangen "Christi" is repeated here. 


758 Ari. Kai. Ill, 103-107. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2836-2839. 


We should boast and rejoice because we suffer these 
things, not for our own iniquities, as thieves, murderers, 
etc., but for the sake of Christ, our Savior and Lord, 
whose gospel we teach purely. But by these two things 
our boasting is especially great and firm: first, that we are 
sure that we have the pure and divine doctrine; secondly, 
that our cross or suffering is Christ's suffering. Therefore 
we have no cause to lament and weep when the world 
persecutes and kills us, but to rejoice and be glad in the 
highest. The world judges us to be wretched and 
accursed people, but Christ, who is greater than the 
world, for whose sake we suffer, declares us blessed and 
calls us to rejoice 2c. He says [Matt. 5:11, 12], "Blessed 
are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, 
and shall say all manner of evil against you, because they 
lie against you. Be glad and of good cheer" 2c. Therefore 
our boasting is quite different from that of the world, which 
does not boast in tribulation, shame, persecution, death 
2c., but of its power, riches, peace, honor, wisdom and 
righteousness. But the end of their glory and joy is 
mourning and shame. 

101 Furthermore, the cross of Christ does not mean 
the wood that Christ carried on his shoulders and on 
which he was nailed afterwards, but it generally means 
all the tribulations of all the blessed, whose sufferings are 
Christ's sufferings. 2 Cor. 1, 5: "We have much of the 
suffering of Christ," and Col. 1, 24: "I rejoice in my 
suffering for you, and in my flesh | make up for the lack of 
afflictions in Christ for his body, which is the church" 2c. 
Thus the cross of Christ is called in general all the 
tribulations of the church, which it suffers for Christ's 
sake, to which Christ himself testifies, in the Acts of the 
Apostles, Cap. 9, 4, where he says, "Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou me?" Saul did not do violence to Christ, 
but to his church. But he that toucheth them toucheth the 
apple of his eye [Zech. 2:8]. There is a more tender and 


sensitive (velocior) feeling in the head than in the other 


members of the body; this we see in experience. For 
when a toe of the foot is wounded, or another even so 





759 


If a small part of the body is affected, the head 
immediately shows in the face that it feels this. For the 
nose is wrinkled, the eyes are used 2c. Thus Christ, our 
head, makes our afflictions his own, and suffers when 
we, his body, suffer. 

It is useful to know this, so that we do not grieve too 
much or despair completely when we see our 
adversaries persecuting us, condemning us, and killing 
us, and also that the heretics hate us with such a hostile 
spirit, but remember after the example of Paul that we 
must then, in the cross, boast most of all that we have 
taken upon ourselves not because of our sins but for the 
sake of Christ. If we consider the sufferings we endure 
only in themselves, they are not only burdensome to us, 
but also unbearable. But when the pronoun of the 
second person "thine" is added, that we may say: 1) Thy 
sufferings, O Christ, are many upon us; likewise, as it is 
said in the 44th Psalm [v. 23.], "For thy sake we are daily 
strangled," then the sufferings become not only light, but 
also sweet, as [Matt. 11:30.) it is written, "My yoke is 
easy, and my burden is light." 

It is obvious that today we suffer the hatred and 
persecution of the adversaries for no other reason than 
because we preach Christ purely. If we denied this 2) and 


approved of their harmful errors and unchristian (impios) 
worship, they would not only cease to hate and 
persecute us, but also offer us positions of honor, riches 
2c. Because we suffer these things for the sake of Christ, 
we can boast with full truth with Paul of the cross of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, that is, not of power, favor, riches 2c., 
but of tribulations, weakness, sorrow, afflictions (pugnis) 
of the body, terrors of the spirit, persecutions, and all 
kinds of evils. Therefore we hope that it will also happen 
in a short time that Christ will say to us (what David said 
to the priest Abiathar, 1 Sam. 22, 22.): "I am guilty of all 
of your

Souls"; likewise Zech. 2, 8: "Whoever touches you 
touches the apple of my eye", as if he wanted to say: 
Whoever wounds you wounds me, for if you did not 
preach my word and confess me, you would not have to 
endure this 2c. So it [is] said John 15:19, "If ye were of 
the world, the world would love its own: because | have 
chosen you of the world, therefore the world hateth you." 
This is also discussed above. 


Through whom the world is crossed to me, and I 
to the world. 


This is a Pauline way of speaking: "The world is 
crucified to me," that is, | pronounce the judgment that 
the world is damned, and "I! am crucified to the world," 
that is, the world again judges that | am damned. Thus 
we crucify and condemn each other. | curse all the 
doctrine, righteousness and works of the world as the 
poison of the devil. Again the world curses my teaching 
and my deeds, judges that | am a harmful man, a heretic, 
a rebel 2c. 

Today the world is crucified to us, and we to the 
world. We curse and condemn the human statutes of 
masses, orders, vows, services, works and all the 
abominations of the pope and heretics as the devil's filth. 
They, on the other hand, persecute and kill us as 
religion's trafficers and disturbers of the public peace. 
The monks dreamed that the world would be crucified to 
them when they entered the monastery. But in this way 
not the world, but Christ is crucified; indeed, the world is 
freed from crucifixion and made more alive by the 
delusion of its own holiness and the confidence in its 
own righteousness, which those have had who have 


entered a spiritual order (religionem), and therefore this 
saying of the apostle has been drawn in quite an 
inconsistent way to the entering of an order. But he 
speaks of a far higher matter, namely that Paul and 
every saint or Christian considers as divine wisdom, 
righteousness and power what the world considers as 
the greatest tyority, godlessness and weakness and 
condemns, and again what the world considers as the 
highest religion and godliness, of which 


761 


Christians know with certainty that it is the highest 
blasphemy. 

Thus the godly judge the world, and again, the world 
judges the godly. But with the godly is the right judgment, 
because a_ spiritual man judges everything 2c. 
[Therefore, the world's judgment of religion or 
righteousness before God disputes with the judgment of 
the godly, as the devil and God dispute with each other. 

108. but as God is crucified to the devil, and again, 
the devil is crucified, that is, as God condemns the 
doctrine and works of the devil ("for the Son of God," 
says John [1 Ep. 3, 8.], "has appeared to destroy the 
works of the devil"), and again, as the devil condemns 
and reverses the word and works of God (for he is a 
murderer and a father of lies [Joh. 8, 44]), so the world 
condemns the doctrine and life of the godly, calling them 
the most harmful heretics and disturbers of the public 
peace, whereas the godly call the world a child of the 
devil, who follows the footsteps of his father most 


faithfully (egregie), that is, who is as much a murderer 
and a liar as his father. This is what Paul means when 
he says, "By whom the world is crucified to me, and | to 
the world." But "world" in the holy scripture means not 
only the publicly ungodly and wicked people, but also the 
best, wisest, holiest 2c. 

1'09. But at the same time he aims covertly at the 
false apostles, as if he wanted to say: | utterly hate and 
abhor all glory that is apart from the cross of Christ, as 
an utterly accursed thing, and not only hold it to be dead, 
but hold that it died most ignominiously, as he dies most 
ignominiously who is nailed to the cross. For the world 
with all its glory is crucified to me, and | to the world. 
Therefore let all those be accursed who boast of your 
flesh and not of the cross of Christ. So Paul testifies with 
these words that he hates the world with the whole 


(perfecto) hatred of the Holy Spirit, and again, the world 
hates him with the whole hatred of the evil spirit, as if he 
wanted to say: It is impossible that any unity can come 
about between me and the world. What shall | do now? 
Should 


762 Lri.vs. 1. ill, 110-112. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2842-2845. 


763 





| give way, and teach what pleases the world? No, but 
unbowed spirit | will only appear bolder against them and 


despise and crucify them as thoroughly (egregie) as they 
despise and crucify me 2c. 

110. Finally, St. Paul also teaches here how to fight 
against Satan, who plagues us continually with ever 
different bodily evils, and inwardly strikes our hearts with 
his fiery darts without ceasing, so that by this stopping, if 
he cannot do it in any other way, he may overthrow our 
faith and turn us away from the truth and Christ: That in 
the same way as we see that St. Paul proudly despised 
the world, we also despise the devil, its prince, with all 
his violence, cunning and infernal raging, and in this way, 
trusting in the assistance of Christ, offer him defiance: 
The more you harm and desire to harm, Satan, the more 
proud | am and ridicule you. The more you terrify and 
seek to throw me into despair, the greater my confidence 
becomes, and | boast in the midst of your raging and 
wickedness, not by my power, but by Christ my Lord, 
whose power is mighty in my weakness [2 Cor. 12:9.]. 
Therefore, when | am weak, | am strong 2c. On the other] 
hand, when he sees that his threats and terrors are 
magnified, he rejoices and terrifies more and more those} 
who have already become fearful 2c. 


V. 15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor 
foreskin counts for anything, but a new creature. 

Paul speaks strangely when he says that in Christ 
Jesus neither circumcision nor foreskin counts for 
anything 2c. He should rather have said: Either 
circumcision or foreskin counts for something, since 
these two things are opposed to each other. Now he says 
that neither counts for anything, as if to say: We must 
come higher, for circumcision and foreskin are far too 
minor things to serve to attain righteousness before} 
GOD. They are indeed opposed to each other, but this 
has nothing to do with Christian righteousness, which is 
not earthly but heavenly. Therefore it does not exist 





in bodily things. Therefore, whether you are circumcised 
or have foreskin, it is all the same, for both are of no 
value in Christ. 

The Jews were very angry when they heard that 
circumcision was not valid. They easily admitted that the 
foreskin was not valid, but when the same was said of 
the Law and of circumcision, it was unbearable for them 
to hear it. For, in order to defend the law and 
circumcision, they fought to the death. The papists today 
also fight fiercely to maintain their human statutes of 
meat-eating, celibacy, holidays, etc., and they banish 
and curse us, who teach that these are not valid in Christ 
Jesus. Likewise, some of ours are no less tasteless than 
the papists, for they consider freedom from the statutes 
of the pope to be something so necessary that they fear 
to sin if they do not immediately violate and abolish them 
all with one another. But Paul says that we must have 
something far greater and more delicious to attain 
righteousness before God than law or circumcision, than 
keeping or transgressing the papal statutes. In Christ 
JEsu he says- neither circumcision nor foreskin, neither 
celibacy nor marriage, neither food nor fasting applies 
2c. "Food does not promote us before GOD. If we eat, 
we shall not be better because of it; if we do not eat, we 
shall be nothing less because of it" [1 Cor. 8:8]. These 
things are far too subordinate; indeed, the whole world 
with all its laws and righteousnesses is far too small to 
be included in the doctrine of justification. 

Reason and carnal wisdom does not understand this, 
because it does not hear anything from the Spirit of God 
[1 Cor. 2:14]. Therefore it claims that righteousness is in 
external things. But we are so informed by God's Word 
that we can declare as certain that in the whole world 
there is absolutely nothing that can serve for 
righteousness before God, but the one and only Christ, 
or, as he says here: "a new creature". But worldly laws, 
human statutes, church ceremonies, even the law of 
Moses are things that are apart from Christ. They do not 
serve for righteousness before 


764 Lr. sai. m, 111-118. Executed. Explanation d. Galatians 6, 15. w. vill, 2845-2647. 


765 





God. They may well be used as good and necessary 
things, but in their place and time. But if they are used in 
the business of justification, they are of no value at all, 
but do much harm, because in Christ Jesus neither 
circumcision nor foreskin is of any value, but a new 
creature. 

114 And Paul excludes by these two parts, 
circumcision and foreskin, everything that exists in the 
whole world, and says that it is not valid in Christ Jesus, 
that is, in matters of faith and salvation. For by the 
figurative speech of the synecdoche he takes the part 
for the whole, that is, by "foreskin" he understands all 
Gentiles, by "circumcision" all Jews, with all their powers 
and all their glory, as if he wanted to say: All that the 
Gentiles can accomplish with all their wisdom, 
righteousness, laws, power, kingdoms, empires, counts 
for nothing in Christ JEsu. Likewise, everything that the 
Jews are and can do with all their Moses, law, 
circumcision, worship, temple, kingdom, priesthood, 
counts for nothing. Therefore, in Christ Jesus or in the 
matter of justification, one should not argue about the 
laws of the Gentiles or the Jews, whether the ceremonial 
law or the moral law makes righteous, but one must 
simply make the negative statement: "In Christ Jesus 
neither circumcision nor foreskin counts for anything. 
So the laws are evil? No, rather they are good and 
useful, but in their order and in the right place, that is, in 
physical and civil matters, which cannot be administered 
without laws. Then also in the churches we observe 
certain ceremonies and laws, not because their 
observance is for righteousness, but for good order, 
example, tranquility, and unity, according to the saying 
[1 Cor. 14:40.], "Let all things be done honestly and 
orderly." But if the laws are so laid down, and their 
keeping so required, that the keeping of them shall make 
righteous, and the not keeping of them shall condemn, 
then they must be utterly done away with and abolished, 
because then Christ loses his office and glory, who 
alone makes righteous, who alone gives the Spirit 2c. 
Paul therefore says with these words most clearly 


that neither circumcision nor foreskin is valid, but a new 
creation 2c. But since in Christ neither the laws of the 
Gentiles nor of the Jews are valid for anything, the pope 
has acted exceedingly ungodly by forcing us to keep his 
laws as if we would thereby become righteous 2c. 

But "a new creature", by which the image of God is 
restored, does not come into being through the 
appearance or hypocrisy of any outward works ("for in 
Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor foreskin counts for 
anything"), but through Christ it is created in the image 
of God in righteousness and holiness. When works are 
done, they produce a new appearance by which the 


world and the flesh can be bribed (capiuntur), but nota 
new creature. For the heart remains godless as before, 
full of contempt for God, unbelief 2c. Therefore a new 
creature is the work of the Holy Spirit, who purifies the 
heart through faith, and works godliness, love, chastity 
2c. and gives the power to keep the flesh in check and 
to flee the righteousness and wisdom of the world 2c. 
Here is not an appearance or only a new outward form, 
but the thing itself is carried out. In fact, there arises 
another sense and another judgment, namely, a spiritual 
one, which thereafter abhors what it formerly held in high 
esteem. Formerly our hearts were so taken up with the 
monastic life that we considered it the only way to 
blessedness; now we judge it far differently. What we 
worshipped as extremely holy things before we became 
this new creature, we are ashamed of now when we 
think of it. 

Therefore, a change in clothing and other outward 
things is not a new creature, as the monks dream, but 
the renewal of the mind by the Holy Spirit, which is 
followed by a change in the members and senses of the 
body. For where the heart receives new light, a new 
judgment, and new impulses through the gospel, it 
happens that the outward senses are also renewed. For 
the ears delight in hearing God's word, no longer human 
statutes and dreams. The mouth 


766 Li-I. Oai. Ill, 115-117. Interpretations on the epist 


e to the Galatians. W. VIII, 2847-2850. 767 





and the tongue does not praise their works, 
righteousness and rule, but with joy only praises the 
mercy of God, which has been shown to us in Christ 2c. 
These are changes, which, | say, are not in words 
(verbales), but in deeds (reales), which bring with them a 
new mind, will, sensations, and actions, even of the 
flesh; so that the eyes, ears, mouth, and tongue not only 
see, hear, and speak differently than before, but also that 
the mind itself approves and follows another. 

For formerly, when our heart was blinded by papist 
error and darkness, it dreamed that God was a merchant 
who sold His grace to us for our works and merits. But 
now that the light of the Gospel has dawned, it certainly 
believes that we are counted righteous by faith in Christ 
alone, and therefore now casts away all works of its own 
choosing, and does the works of its calling and love that 
God has commanded, praising and extolling God, and 
boasting and being joyful in trusting in the mercy of God 
in Christ alone. If there is any misfortune or danger to 
suffer, it suffers it gladly and with joy (even though the 
flesh grumbles against it). This is what Paul calls a new 
creature. 


V.16. And as many as walk according to this rule, 
upon them be peace and mercy. 


This he added as a summa (epiphonema). This is 
the only and right rule according to which we must walk, 
namely the new creature. The Franciscans interpret this 
saying in the most godless way to their rule. That is why 
these blasphemous and robber people have boasted 
that their rule is much more holy than others, because it 
is founded and confirmed by the apostolic testimony and 
reputation. Surely Paul is not talking here about the 
caps, plates on the head, rope, wooden shoes, whistling 
in the church, and similar quite trivial antics, which are 
included in their rule, but about the new creature, which 
is neither circumcision nor foreskin, but a new man, 
created in the image of God in righteousness and 
holiness. 


Righteousness and holiness, who is inwardly righteous 
in spirit, and outwardly holy and pure according to the 
flesh. The Franciscans and all monks have a 
righteousness and holiness, but a hypocritical and 
godless one, because they do not hope to become 
righteous by faith in Christ alone, but by keeping their 
rule. Then, although they pretend to holiness outwardly, 
keeping their eyes, hands, tongue and other limbs in 
check, they nevertheless have an unrighteous heart, 
which is full of evil air, hatred, anger, unchastity, idolatry, 
contempt and hatred of God, blasphemy against Christ 
2c. For they are exceedingly bitter enemies of the truth. 

Cursed be the rule of Franciscus, Dominic and other 
monks, because by it, first of all, Christ's good deeds and 
glory have been obscured and buried, and the gospel of 
grace and life has been completely suppressed, and 
secondly, the world has been filled by it with innumerable 
idolatries, false worship of God, godless false spirituality 


(religionibus), self-chosen works 2c. But this rule, of 
which Paul speaks here, is the only one given, since by 
it we live in faith in Christ and become a new creature, 
that is, truly righteous and holy through the Holy Spirit, 
not through an empty pretense or hypocrisy. To those 
who walk according to this rule belongs peace, that is, 
God's pleasure, forgiveness of sins and a quiet 
conscience, and mercy, that is, help in tribulations and 
forgiveness of the sin that is still left in the flesh. Yes, 
even if those who walk according to this rule are 
overtaken by a fault or a fall, mercy comes to their aid 
because they are children of grace and peace, so that 
their sin and fall is not imputed to them 2c. 


And about the Israel of GOD. 


121 Here he aims at the false apostles and the Jews, 
who boasted of the fathers, of being the chosen people, 
of the law 2c., Rom. 9, 3-5. as if he wanted to say: "The 
Israel of God" are not those who are begotten according 
to the flesh of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, but those who, 
with the believing Abraham, follow the promises.

Jews or Gentiles. This subject is abundantly dealt with 
above in the third chapter. 


V. 17. From now on, no one will give me any more 
trouble. 


With displeasure (stomacho) and indignation he 
closes the epistle, as if to say: | have faithfully taught the 
gospel as | received it from Christ by revelation. 
Whoever does not want to follow, may follow whom he 
likes, but may he not trouble me any more. In short, this 
is my opinion in a few words: that Christ, whom | have 
preached, is the only High Priest and Savior of the world. 
Let the world therefore walk according to this rule, of 
which | have spoken here in the whole epistle, or be 
eternally lost. 


V.18. For I bear the marks of the Lord JEsu on 
my body. 


(123) As the Minorites [Franciscans] interpret the 
above saying, "As many walk according to this rule," to 
mean that it is said of their rule, so they invent that it is 
to be understood of the marks of their Franciscus. | 
consider it a mere fiction and mockery what they said 
about this. But it may be that Franciscus had the marks 
on his body, as he is painted, but they were not given to 
him for the sake of Christ, but he had them himself out 
of foolish devotion, or rather out of vain honor, with 
which he could tickle himself that he loved Christ so 
much that he also marked his wounds on his body. 

The correct understanding of this passage is this: 


The scars (notae@) that | bear on my body show 
sufficiently whose servant | am. If | sought to please men 
and insisted that circumcision and the keeping of the law 
were necessary for salvation, and boasted of your flesh, 
as the false apostles do, it would not have been 
necessary for me to bear these marks on my body. But 
because | am the servant of Jesus Christ and walk 
according to the right rule, that is, publicly. 


righteousness and salvation apart from Christ, therefore 


| must also bear Christ's marks (insignia), which are not 
marks that | have acquired of my own free will, but which 
are inflicted on me against my will by the world and by 
Satan for no other reason than because | preach that 
Jesus is the Christ. 

So he calls the marks of the wounds that are marked 
on his body and his suffering, then also the fiery darts of 
the devil, the sorrow and terror of the heart. These 
sufferings he commemorates everywhere in his epistles, 
and Lucas in the Acts of the Apostles. In the first letter 
to the Corinthians, cap. 4, 9, 11-13, he says: "But | think 
that God has presented us apostles as the very least, as 
given over to death. For we have become a spectacle to 
the world, and to angels, and to men"; likewise: "Until 
this hour we suffer hunger and thirst, and are naked, and 
are beaten, and have no certain place, and work and 
labor with our own hands. We are scolded, we are 
persecuted, we are blasphemed. We are always as a 
curse of the world, and a sweep offering of all men." 
Likewise 2 Cor. 6, 4. 5.: "In great patience, in 
tribulations, in distresses, in beatings, in prisons, in riots, 
in labor, in watchings, in fastings" 2c., and Cap. 11, 23- 
26. and Cap. 12, 10. 11.:"I| have suffered more beatings, 
| have been imprisoned more often, often in mortal 
distresses. From the Jews | have received five times 
forty strokes less one. | have been beaten three times, 
stoned once, shipwrecked three times, spent day and 
night in the depths of the sea. | have traveled often; | 
have been in peril on the sea, in peril among murderers, 
in peril among the Jews, in peril among the Gentiles, in 
peril in cities, in peril in deserts, in peril on the sea, in 
peril among false brethren" 2c. 


(126) These are the right marks, that is, the notae 


impressae, of which the apostle speaks here, which we 
also have today by the grace of God on our bodies.

We must bear them in our bodies for the sake of Christ. 
For the world persecutes and kills us, false brethren hate 
us bitterly, Satan terrifies us inwardly in our hearts with 
his fiery darts for no other reason than because we teach 
that Christ is our righteousness and our life. These 
marks we do not choose for ourselves out of sweet 
devotion, nor do we suffer them gladly; but because the 
world and Satan bring them upon us for Christ's sake, 
we must suffer them, and boast with Paulo in spirit (who 
is always willing, boasting, and rejoicing) that we bear 
them in our bodies. For they are the seal and most 
certain testimony of right doctrine and true faith. Paul 
said this, as | reminded you above, with a certain 
indignation. 


The grace of our Lord JEsu Christ: be with your 
spirit, dear brothers, Amen. 


This is the last farewell. Concludes the letter with the 
same words with which he 





started him, as if he wanted to say: | have taught you 
Christ purely, | have pleaded with you, | have scolded 
you, 2c. and | have omitted nothing which, in my opinion, 
would be useful to you. There is nothing more that | 
could add, except that | pray from the bottom of my heart 
that our Lord Jesus Christ may bless and prosper my 
work, and govern you with his Spirit forever. 


Now | am finished (hactenus) with the interpretation 
of the epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians. The Lord Jesus 
Christ, our Justifier and Savior, who has given me grace 
and ability to interpret this epistle, and you to hear it, 
sustain and strengthen me and you (this | implore from 
the bottom of my heart), so that we may grow more and 
more every day in the knowledge of his grace, and be 
found blameless and blameless in an unfeigned faith on 
the day of our redemption. To Him be glory forever with 
the Father and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

775 





C. D. Martin Luther's explanation of the saying St. Paul Gal. 1, 4. 5. 


Christ gave himself for our sins 2c.*) 
Preached Anno 1538. 


Gal.1, 4.5. Christ gave Himself for our sins. 


There is not a single word in the entire epistle of St. 
Paul to the Galatians, especially in the first three 
chapters, in which the apostle does not deal with the 
main point of Christian doctrine, namely, how we are to 
be redeemed from sin and death and come to grace, 
eternal life and salvation before God. He freely says that 
it is not by the works of the law, much less by works or 
worship services devised and chosen by men, but that 
Christ alone must and can accomplish this. Therefore 
nothing else comes out of his mouth, except always for 
and for: Christ, Christ; that all his words are full of the 
spirit, everything burns and lives especially when he 
speaks. 

2 But notice, dear one, and pay attention to how 
clearly and precisely he uses all the words. He does not 
say: Christ was pleased with our righteousness and 
good works. No, no! Nor does he say, "He has accepted 
from lins the sacrifices commanded in the law of Moses, 
much less our chosen services, masses, vows, 
pilgrimages," but rather, "He himself has given. Dear, 
what has he given? No gold nor silver, no ox nor paschal 
lamb, no kingdom, empire or world, yes, not even an 
angel. What then! Something much higher and more 
precious than anything created in heaven and earth. 
Dear, what is it? "Himself." For what? 





Certainly not for a crown or a kingdom, certainly not for 
our righteousness or holiness, but "for our sin". 

(3) Are not all these words like mighty thunderbolts 
from heaven, against all men's righteousness, hardness, 
and holiness, that it may have appearance and name, 
as great and glorious as it may be? As then such mighty 
thunderbolts, against all men's holiness and wisdom, are 
also in all the words of this saying Joh. 1, 29: "Behold, 
this is the Lamb of God, which bareth the sin of the 
world." Therefore, all the words in this and similar 
sayings, each one in particular, should be considered 
most diligently, and not be fluttered over so carelessly 
and badly 1). For it is exceedingly rich comfort to the 
poor, frightened and stupid consciences, when they 
grasp them by faith. 

(4) If then thou art grieved for thy sin, and wouldest 
be rid of it, and have a gracious God in heaven, take not 
this or any other thing to gain such treasure by it, for it is 
in vain; but hear what St. Paul saith unto thee 
concerning God. He says that there is a man called 
Jesus Christ who gave himself for all our sins. These are 
rich, important, glorious and comforting words. 


1) Thus the Wittenbergers and the Jenaers; Erlanger: carelessly 
badly and overhin fladdern. 





*This sermon was first published in a single edition by Hans Weif® in Wittenberg in 1538 under the title: "The saying of St. Paul 
Gal. 1. 'Christ gave himself for our sin, that he might save us from this present evil world’ 2c. Salvific and comforting to all afflicted and 
anxious consciences. By D. Mart. Luther." After that, together with the sermon, which is found in the St. Louis edition vol. X, 1088 ff., it was 
published in 1551 by D. Bernhard Ziegler in Leipzig, provided with a preface, and printed in Leipzig by Georg Hantzsch. The latter edition 
had D. Rambach had the latter edition reprinted in 1721 under the title: "Des Mannes Gottes M. Lutheri lauteres und apostolisches Zeugni3 
von Christo fiir uns. In the collective editions: in the Wittenberg (1553), vol. IV, p. 328d; in the Jena (1568), vol. VII, p. 22; in the Altenburg,

the Erlanger, which brings the first pressure, under comparison of the Wittenberger and the Jenaer edition, however without noting each 


time, where we do not follow the Erlanger. 


776 En1.(2,)s0a,i48-iso. Explanation of Gal. 1, 4. 5. w. 1x. 381-384. 


(5) Both Moses in the Law and the prophets in their 
writings prophesied of such redemption and atonement 
for our sins; and all who were godly before the future of 
Christ 1) had the understanding and faith that they could 
not be saved by circumcision, nor by the works 
commanded in the Law, but by Christ, who was 
promised to Abraham. 

Therefore, this is one of the most noble and 
comforting sayings in St. Paul, and a true carthorse, 
emergency snake and main piece, so that the unholy 
papacy with all its supposed religion, holiness, self- 
chosen ecclesiastical statuses and services, may be 
turned to ruin and ground. For where our sins could be 
redeemed by our own works, merits, satisfaction: Dear, 
what would have been necessary for God's Son to give 
Himself for this? But because He gave Himself for this 
purpose, we will certainly leave them unredeemed by 
our works. 

(7) Furthermore, we should learn from these words, 
"Who gave Himself for our sins," that our sins are so 
great, inordinate, and insurmountable that it is 
impossible that even the whole world, gathered into one 
heap, could do enough for them. For since it cost God 
such a precious, unspeakable treasure, namely His only 
Son, who had to give Himself for it, it is good to assume 
that we cannot atone for it nor overcome it with all our 
piety and righteousness, even if we had the merit of all 
the saints. Therefore, with these words: "He who gave 
Himself for our sins", truly the power and authority of 
sins is made very great. 

(8) Most of the people on earth are good fellows, they 
go along in the safest way, and they put sin to the wind 
as a bad, little thing that has little meaning; indeed, when 
it comes to the point that sin begins to bite the 
conscience, one does not consider it great, but thinks: 
"There is no need, | will counsel the matter well, | will do 
this or that to atone for the sin, and thus please God. We 
should 


1) Erlanger: godly. 





777 


But if we consider the magnitude of the great, inordinate 
treasure that is given for it, we would realize that the 
burden of sins is so exceedingly great and heavy that it 
is inestimable to all the world: how then could they pay 
for it with their strength and works and be able to do 
enough for it? Dear one, take these words: "He Himself" 
2c. to heart, and consider them with seriousness and 
diligence, then you will learn to understand that the word 
"sin" contains the eternal wrath of God, together with all 
the power and might of the sorrowful infernal Satan. For 
the fact that he causes so much misery and heartache 
on earth, that 2) we are not safe from him for a single 
moment of our lives, and have to be constantly aware of 
all misfortune, is all the fault of sins. Therefore it is not 
such an easy and small thing, as the blind, sure reason 
lets it dream and think. 

(9) Therefore, this saying is most powerful: that all 
men are prisoners of sin, even (as St. Paul says 
elsewhere) sold under sin as bond servants, Rom. 7:14, 
and further: that sin is a mighty, cruel lord and tyrant 
over all men on the whole face of the earth, whom no 
one can resist, no matter how high, wise, learned, 
powerful he may be. Even if all people under the wide 
sky were united, they would still not be able to overcome 
this tyrant with all their power, but all would have to hold 
out and let themselves be strangled and devoured by 
him. Jesus Christ alone is the hero who can control the 
cruel, insurmountable enemy. But it costs him a lot, the 
dear Lord, because he has to give his life for it. 

(10) Again, this saying gives a very great, rich 
comfort to all those who have a stupid, despondent 
conscience because of their sin. For although sin, as | 
said, is a cruel and insurmountable tyrant, but because 
Christ takes our place, takes all our sin upon Himself, 
sacrifices Himself for it on the cross, and lets the 
judgment pass over Him as if He were accursed before 
God, and the greatest sinner that ever came on earth, 
sin loses all its right, strength and power to 


2) Erlanger: "and that". 


778 En. (S.) so," 156-152. interpretations on the epistle to the Galatians. w. 1x, 384-387. 


and must now lie under his feet. But all these things he 
has done for us, for he would not have been able to do 
them for himself, because he has not committed any sin, 
and no deceit was found in his mouth, Isa. 53, 9. 1 Petr. 
2, 22. Therefore, whoever believes these things and 
accepts them with joy and thanksgiving, sin cannot harm 
him, much less condemn him. For Christ paid a high 
enough price, gave himself for it, and in its place gave 
him his innocence and righteousness. It is true that sin 
does much harm to the pious, because they still live in 
the flesh; it frightens and grieves them heartily, but it can 
do no more. For when they regain their composure and 
grasp with faith this sentence: "Christ gave himself for 
our sins," sin is no longer terrible to them, for it is now 
bound and imprisoned, and indeed already condemned. 
What can it do? The wild, raw, great crowd knows 
nothing of this; Christians know something of it, if sin 
presses, and yet resist it with faith and comfort of such 
sayings. 

(11) When you thus learn Christ from this and similar 
sayings in St. Paul, that he alone is the subjugator of sin, 
you can freely judge and pass sentence on all kinds of 
doctrine and life, and say: If sin is such an abominable 
tyrant that it is superior to the whole world with its power, 
then the teaching of the pope and of all works saints 
must be false and forged, who pretends that we can 
overcome sin by our ability and powers. Item, you can 
also pass judgment on the life of all works saints, and 
say: If one cannot get rid of sin in any other way, Christ 
gives himself for it, then it is all in vain and for nothing 
what all papists and religious boast of their spiritual 
state, service, hard and sour life, as if they should 
thereby atone for sin, acquire grace and blessedness. 
Yes, it is an abominable blasphemy, so that they 
obscure and cover up Christ's highest love and good 
deeds towards us, and preach, honor and worship their 
filth and filthiness, that is, humanity and doctrines of the 
devil, instead of them. 

12. whoever now wants to be a Christian in earnest, 
and remembers this saying of St. Paul, will benefit from 
it. 





779 


Let him see to it that he makes it right in his mind, and 
that he moves every word with all diligence, and that he 
pays special attention to the little word "for ours. For in 
this all power lies, that we may well perceive everything 
that is said of us in the holy Scriptures by such words, 
for me, for us, for our sin, and the like, and that we may 
actually know how to interpret it to ourselves, and to hold 
fast to it with faith, and to live and die on it. For there is 
never a lack of something great and excellent hidden 
underneath, to which one should pay special attention 
and take good note. You have easily and quickly put it 
into your heart that you say yes to the fact that Christ, 
the Son of God, was given for the sins of St. Peter, St. 
Paul and other saints who were worthy of such grace. 
On the other hand, it is extremely difficult for you, as a 
poor, unworthy, condemned sinner, to believe with all 
your heart, to hold, and to say without any doubt: Christ, 
the Son of God, was given for your sins, many of which 
are also great and grave, and yet you have never been 
worthy of such grace. This, | say, is certainly difficult, 
and great toil and labor 2c. 

(13) Therefore it is a bad thing to praise and extol the 
kindness and good deeds of Christ in general, as if he 
had given himself for sin, but for those who were worthy 
of it, and deserved it by their holy lives. But if one should 
direct the tongue and say that he died for all our sins, for 
mine and yours and for the sins of the whole wager, then 
the human being recoils and recoils and is not allowed 
to come face to face with God. For he cannot bring 
himself to believe that such a treasure is given to him 
out of pure grace, through Christ, without his own merit 
and worthiness. That is why he does not want to have 
anything to do or to send with God, unless he is 
completely pure and sinless beforehand. And even if he 
reads or hears this saying: "Christ, the Son of God, gave 
Himself for our sins," or other such things, he still does 
not understand and interpret the word "our" to mean his 
own person, but thinks that it is said of others who are 
holy and worthy of such graces: for this reason, he 
thinks that he can have such graces. 


780 Eri. (2.) 2OA, 152-154. explanation of the saying Gal. 1, 4. 5. W. IX, 387-389. 


He cannot be granted mercy until he has 1) first earned 
it through his good works and made himself worthy of it. 
This is a foolish and harmful attitude, and stems from the 
fact that man neither understands nor recognizes the 
greatness and power of both sin and God's mercy. 
Therefore, he would like sin not to be as great and 
terrible as the Scriptures make it out to be and speak of 
it, but rather a badly minor harm that could easily be 
dealt with without Christ's help; just as in truth people do 
not have different thoughts about sin. This is evident 
from the fact that they sin so grievously without any fear 
or hesitation, and live and persist in sins so surely. And 
if at times their conscience is stirred, they turn a deaf ear 
to it, thinking it will have no need. Because they neither 
know nor feel what and how great, heavy, even 
unmistakable a burden it is for sin, it is impossible that 
they should understand what is said: "Christ gave 
himself for our sins"; and if they repeat it at once, it is no 
real earnestness to them, but an outright joke, or, if it 
comes to the top, a hypocrisy and false humility, so that 
they let themselves be heard outwardly with words, as if 
they were sinners in need of Christ's help. But basically 
our blind reason is so minded that it would like to present 
such a sinner to our Lord God, who would say with his 
mouth: | am a sinner; and yet in his heart he would think 
that he was pious and righteous; who also felt no sin, 
nor the terror of death, but who was healthy, pure and 
fresh in all things, and had no need of a physician. And 
if such were to be the case, then it would gladly be 
believed that Christ, the Son of God, was given for our 
sins. 

(14) All men are like this, especially those who want 
to be the best and holiest in the world. For all monks and 
saints of works confess with their mouths that they are 
sinners and commit sin every day, but not so great and 
so much that they cannot redeem and pay for it with their 
holy lives and good works. 2) They do not confess that 
they have sinned so much. 


1) Thus the Wittenbergers; the other editions: themselves. 2) 
Erlangers: shall. 





781 


Indeed, they still intend to bring the other merits of their 
hard order before the judgment seat of Christ, and to 
expect a special reward from him before other common 
Christians. But lest they whiten and purify themselves of 
all things, they speak with their mouths, but with unequal 
hearts, with the publican Luc. 18:13: "God be merciful to 
me a poor sinner!" All this comes from this ignorance 
and error, that they think that sin is such a bad and small 
thing that it can be atoned for and reconciled by human 
laws and works, or, if it comes to it, by works of God's 
commandments. Therefore, it is impossible for such 
hypocrites to understand these or similar words of St. 
Paul or Christ, much less that they should console 
themselves with them when they feel their sin rightly in 
mortal distress or otherwise in terrible temptations, but 
must despair terribly. 

(15) For this reason, of course, it is the highest art 
and right wisdom of Christians that these and similar 
words of St. Paul, or of the Scriptures, should be taken 
seriously and believed to be true, namely, that Christ 
was given into death, not for our righteousness or 
holiness, but rather for our sins, which are real, great, 
great, many, even innumerable and insurmountable 
sins. Therefore let no man dream, as the hypocrites do, 
that our sins are so small and trifling, that we can blot 
them out with our own works. And again, let no one 
despair whether, as has been said, they are so great and 
grievous, but let every one understand here from St. 
Paul, and only firmly believe that Christ gave himself, not 
for sins dreamed of or painted, but for sins that are true, 
not for sins that are small and little, but for sins that are 
exceedingly great and gross, not for one or two, but for 
all, not for sins that have been overcome and blotted out, 
but for sins that are unconquered, great and mighty. For 
indeed no man, yea, no angel, can overcome a few, 
even the very least sin. And where thou art not found in 
the number that say, "For our sin," that is, among those 
who follow the doctrine of the

If you have faith, hear, learn, do, love and believe, you 
may well freely consider that your salvation is over and 
all things are finished.

diligently, that thou mayest be skillful, not only when thou 
art well satisfied with thy conscience out of temptation, 
but when thou hast to fight with sin and death in the 
highest distresses and perils, when thy conscience is 
mindful of the sins thou hast committed 1), and is 
frightened, and Satan comes under your eyes with real 
earnestness, and with all his power subdues you with the 
great burden of your sins, as with a flood of sin, to assail 
you, to frighten you away from Christ and to chase you 
away, and finally to bring you to despair. Then think (I 
say) that with a courageous heart and strong faith you 
may say, "Christ, God's Son, is given," not for the saints' 
righteousness, nor for the angels' innocence, but for the 
poor sinners' unrighteousness. If | were righteous and 
had no sin, | should have nothing of Christ, the Mediator, 
who reconciled me to God. Why then do you want to 
make me a saint in such a wrong way, you unholy Satan, 
and demand vain righteousness from me, who have 
nothing but vain sin. Not imaginary sins, but real, true 
ones; not bad and small ones, but great, gross and 
exceedingly grave ones, such as not fearing God, not 
believing in him, doubting his goodness, not praising and 
glorifying him for all his unspeakable goods and benefits, 
which he has shown me both in soul and body; not 
calling on his name in times of need, even though he has 
commanded such, and promised that he would hear and 
help; but | do just the opposite: | grumble against him, 
become impatient, even angry and curse when things do 
not go my way; | do not hear, read and study his holy, 
precious word with earnestness and diligence, but 
neglect it without need, soon become weary and tired of 
it, and despise it 2c. Which of course are great, gross, 
grave sins against the first tablet. 

017 Wherefore also | sin daily against the other table, 
namely, that | do not honor 


1) In the old editions: "to think in". 





my dear parents, do not raise my children to godliness 
and respectability, am not obedient to the authorities, 
covet my neighbor's goods and wife 2c. And let it be so, 
that | have not murdered, have not broken marriage, 
have not stolen, and have not done such other gross 
things against the other table by deed, nevertheless | 
have done it with the heart and thought. | am therefore a 
transgressor of all God's commandments, and my sins, 
alas, are so many that they could not all be written on a 
large cowhide; indeed, it is impossible that they should 
be counted, for they are more than the sand of the sea. 
Therefore cease, thou wicked false spirit, and tell me not 
much of my piety and good works, as if thereby | could 
and should obtain forgiveness of sins; there is nothing 
gained: For to obtain forgiveness of sins is not man's 
work, nor angel's; but thou art such an excellent artist 
and master, that thou canst make even my very best 
works and righteousness the very greatest sins. 

(18) Therefore, because my sins are so serious, 
namely, that they are real, true, great, horrible, 
innumerable and insurmountable sins, and my own 
righteousness is of no use to me at all, but rather can be 
harmful, | follow the words of St. Paul, the dear and 
faithful apostle of Christ, who teaches me: Christ gave 
himself for this according to the will of God the Father, 
so that he might do enough for it, and thus save me and 
all who believe it from it 2) and make them blessed. To 
Him be praise and glory for such His unspeakable love, 
amen. 

(19) Therefore, all the power and might of 
blessedness is involved in these words being considered 
serious and true. | do not say this in vain, for | have 
experienced it many times, and still experience it every 
day, the longer the more it becomes difficult, especially 
when the conscience feels the burden of sins, the terror 
of death and God's wrath, that he should then certainly 
believe that Christ was given, not for those who are holy, 
righteous, worthy and worthy of God.

but for those who are ungodly, sinners, unworthy and|You, too, can thank me for the overwhelmingly great 


enemies of God, who rightly deserve God's wrath, 
eternal death and damnation. Therefore we should 
prepare our hearts with these and similar sayings, of 
which the Scriptures are full, so that when the devil 
comes and accuses us (as he is wont to do to all the 
godly) and says, "You are a sinner, therefore you are my 
own and a child of eternal damnation," we may then, | 
say, be able to meet him and answer him: Yes, dear 
devil, for this very reason that you accuse me of being a 
sinner and therefore want to condemn me, | will believe 
all the more confidently that | am holy and righteous and 
will certainly be saved. 

20 And whether he will stop yet, as indeed he is wont 
to do; for he walketh about as a roaring lion, 1 Peter 5:8, 
saying, In short, thou art lost; that thou knowest how to 
stop thyself, and to stand fast, and to say, Not so; for | 
cleave unto Christ, who gave himself for my sin. 
Therefore you, wretched Satan, will not succeed at all in 
reproaching me with the greatness of my sins, and thus 
frighten me, distress me and lead me into despair, and 
make me forget God's unspeakable grace and mercy, 
shown to me and all sinners through Christ, and look 
upon him as a severe, wrathful judge who wants to 
condemn me eternally, and thus not only be like him, but 
also blaspheme and disgrace him. But just by telling me 
that | am a poor, great sinner, you give me sword and 
weapons in my hand, so that | can overcome you 
mightily, yes, strangle you with your own weapons and 
put you down. For if you can tell me that | am a poor 
sinner, | can tell you again that Christ died for sinners 
and is their advocate. Then you yourself proclaim to me 
God's glory and honor by reminding me of God's fatherly 
love and faithfulness toward me, namely, that he so 
loved me, a poor, great and condemned sinner, that he

Jesus Christ, who willingly took upon his shoulder the 
burden of my sins and all the sorrow and misery that 
should have pressed upon me forever, and for this 
suffered the bitter death on the cross. To this | direct you; 
you may therefore accuse and condemn him. But me you 
shall leave satisfied; for on his shoulders, not on mine, 
are all my sins and the sins of the whole world. For God 
the Father has laid on him all our sins and iniquities, says 
Isaiah, Cap. 53, 6. Item v. 8: "For the iniquity of his people 
he hath smitten him." Therefore you do not frighten me 
by calling me a sinner, but rather comfort me. 

(21) Dear God, whoever could do this art, it would be 
easy for him to show the devil the cowards, with all his 
terrors and fears, with all his wiles and wiles, who 
otherwise, by holding up their sin to people, makes them 
grieve to death and go to hell in despair, unless they are 
well equipped with this divine art and wisdom, which is to 
hold fast through faith in Christ, and resist him. For with 
this alone sin, death and the devil are overcome. But he 
who cannot put sin out of his mind, but keeps it in his 
memory, torments and afflicts himself with it, and thinks 
how he may counsel and help himself with his own 
powers and works, or wants to wait so long that his 
conscience may be satisfied for itself and have rest: he 
first of all comes right into the devil's snares, torments 
himself miserably, and in time, when the temptation 
becomes greater, falls into despair. For the devil does 
not cease to accuse and terrify the conscience until he 
has accomplished his work, that is, brought man to 
despair. 

(22) Therefore, there is nothing better than for a man, 
to whom the devil puts such sad and poisonous thoughts 
into his heart, to imagine this or such sayings of St. Paul, 
in which Christ is rightly and actually depicted as who and 
what he is, namely, the Son of God and of the Virgin 


did not spare his only begotten Son, but gave him for my |Mary, for our sake.

Sin given and died. If then the devil puts it into your heart 
that Christ is a different man than St. Paul paints him 
here, just say freely alfo: he did not hit it right, but lied in 
all his words and letters, therefore you would not accept 
them either. 

(23) | do not speak so many words in vain and 
without cause, for | know very well what cause | have for 
urging so strongly that Christ be rightly and truly 
recognized from St. Paul's words. For Christ is not such 
aman who demands or wants something from us, but is 
rather a reconciler who has reconciled all people in the 
whole world to God. Therefore, if you are a sinner (as we 
all are in truth, and greater than we think and 
understand), do not make of him, in body and in life, a 
severe judge, sitting on the rainbow, angry with sinners 
and wanting to condemn them, as Christ was not viewed 
and recognized in any other way in the papacy, 
otherwise you will have to be frightened and despair 
before him, but grasp him in his right and own image, 
namely, that you view and recognize him as the Son of 
God and of the Virgin Mary, who gave himself for the sins 
of all the world: Not to frighten the sorrowful and 
despairing consciences, much less to cast them out and 
condemn them, but to save them from sin and death, to 
strengthen and comfort them in all anguish and distress, 
and to make them righteous and blessed, 

(24) In this way, learn to know who and what Christ 
is. And especially take heed that you make good use of 
this little word: ours, and be most certain that Christ has 
borne and atoned not only for the sins of some, but for 
all of us, that is, for the whole world. For he certainly and 
truly gave himself up to die for the sins of the whole 
world, even though the whole world does not believe it. 
Therefore you must not only consider your sins to be 
real, grave, great 2c. sins. sins, but also that they are 
your own and no one else's sins; that is, you must know 
and believe that Christ is not only responsible for other 
people's sins, but also for yours. 





be given. Hold fast to this, and do not let yourself be 
turned away from this most lovely image of comfort, in 
which even the dear angels in heaven delight, 1 Pet. 1, 
12, namely, that Christ, according to his right counterfeit 
and image, is ever no Moses, no cane-master nor 
executioner, but such a mediator, who gave himself, not 
for our merits, holiness, righteousness, honor and good 
life 2c., but for our sin, and thereby reconciled us poor 
sinners to God, earning grace, righteousness, eternal 
life and blessedness. Although Christ sometimes 
interprets the law, it is not his own and proper office to 
do so, for which the Father sent him 2c. 

(25) These words, "Christ gave himself for our sins," 
are soon grasped and learned, so that we can repeat 
them, and some people are serious enough to hold fast 
to them; but when it comes to the point where the devil, 
in his temptation, hides Christ from us and takes him 
away from our eyes, and tears the word of grace from 
our hearts, then we find out that we are still far short of 
it, and have not yet learned it properly, or even know 
anything about it. But whoever could then know Christ 
rightly and truly, make Him great, and not regard Him as 
a severe judge, but as our most kind and loving Savior 
and High Priest, would have already overcome all fear, 
distress and death, and would already be in eternal life, 
John 17:24. But there is nothing more difficult on earth 
than to be able to do this in the midst of temptation. 

26. What | say, | have experienced in part, for | know 
very well the devil's cunning and nimble tricks, that he 
not only holds the law against us and inflates it to frighten 
us, and from small splinters makes many large beams, 
that is, from what is probably no sin at all, or even a small 
minor sin, a real hell, so that the wide world becomes too 
narrow; But he also uses the person of Christ, our most 
faithful high priest and savior, as if he were angry with 
sinners and wanted to push them into the abyss of hell. 
For he takes hold of 


788 En. (2) Lia, 161-183. Explanation of the saying Gal. 1, 4. 5. 


A saying from the holy scriptures, or a preaching word 
of Christ, does such a hard blow to our hearts in a flash, 
before we are aware of it, that not only do we lose all 
faith and confidence in Christ, but we are also heartily 
frightened of him, and think that it is the right Christ who 
gives us such thoughts, when in fact it is the wretched 
devil himself. And with such a disguise he can endure us 
for a long time, frighten us with it, and make us stay in 
our minds and delusions, so that our conscience may 
swear on it a thousand oaths that it is the right Christ 
himself, whose words he says. 

27. Finally, this is also one of the right handles of this 
evil-doer's cunning and trickery, that he holds up to us 
only a piece of Christ, not the whole of Christ, namely, 
that he admits that he is the Son of God, born of the 
Virgin Mary, but that he gave himself for our sin, so that 
he does not let one come to him, breaks it off, and tears 
it out of one's heart, mends and adds something strange 
that does not rhyme with the matter at all, namely: Holds 
up for us some threatening word of Christ, that he may 
terrify the wicked; as dangerous this, Luc. 13:3: "Except 
ye repent, ye shall all perish and perish." So this 
poisoning of the pure and certain knowledge of Christ 
makes us believe that Christ is our mediator and savior, 
but he still remains in our hearts a terrible and cruel 
tyrant and master of the rod. We are thus deceived by 
the evil one, so that we lose and abandon the most 
friendly and lovely comforting image of our high priest 
and sin-bearer, Jesus Christ, of all things, and become 
as fearful and timid before him as before the wretched 
devil himself. 

(28) This alone would be cause enough for diligent 
and earnest exhortation and urging, that from these 
words of St. Paul, "Who gave himself for our sin," Christ 
should be rightly and truly learned. For since He gave 
Himself to be put to death for our sins (as is certainly 
true), He is never a tyrant or a judge who condemns us 
for sins, and those who do so are never condemned. 





789 


W. Ix, 397-400. 


1) but who rather helps those who have fallen, comforts 
those who are frightened and takes them into grace, 
reconciles them to God 2c.; otherwise St. Paul would 
have to lie when he says that he gave himself for our sin. 
If | thus imagine Christ, | paint him rightly and actually, 
grasp and have the real Christ as he paints himself, and 


then leave all thoughts and speculations of the divine 
majesty and glory of all things, cling and cling to the 
humanity of Christ; since there is no terror at all, but only 
friendliness and joy, and thus learn to know the Father 
through him. Thus such light and knowledge dawns 
upon me that | know for certain what God is and how he 
is minded, what | myself am, what all creatures are, what 
wickedness and malice there is in the devil's kingdom. 

(29) What | teach here is nothing new, but just what 
the dear apostles and their successors, the holy fathers, 
taught before us. But we are so diligent in our 
perseverance that we would like to see people take it 
seriously and always practice learning such Christian art 
and wisdom, for it can never be learned sufficiently. For 
this purpose, the devil is exceedingly hostile to it; 
therefore, he hinders as much as he can that it should 
not remain pure for long, or that it should snatch us away 
from it through weariness and laziness. Therefore, God 
wanted us to be able to present the doctrine of faith to 
the people, so that they would not only be able to wash 
their mouths of it, but would also hold on to it firmly in 
their hearts, especially in times of death. 


That he saved us from this present evil world. 


30 St. Paul also acts in these words the main part of 
this epistle, calling this whole world, which has been, still 
is, and hereafter will be, a "present world". First he calls 
it "present", against the world that is to come and will be 
eternal. Then he also calls it "bad," because everything 
that is in this present world is of the evil one.

It is called the devil's kingdom because it does not 
recognize God, even despises him, hates him, 
blasphemes him and disobeys his words and works. 
Therefore it is also called the devil's kingdom, because it 
does not recognize God, even despises, hates, 
blasphemes and disgraces him, and acts disobediently 
against all his words and works 2c. In such a kingdom all 
Adam's children are subject to his lord and king, that is, 
the devil. 

(31) Here you see once again that no one can erase 
sin by his own work or powers. For "this present world", 
says St. Paul, "is in trouble". And 1 John 5:19, 1) it is 
written: "it is in trouble. Now as many as are in the world, 
they are all of the sins and members of the devil, yes, 
bond servants; because as he speaks 2 Tim. 2, 26. he 
has captured all men under his tyranny and power, 
according to all his will. What good has it been, then, that 
so many orders have been established and founded, so 
many great and difficult works have been invented, to 
destroy sin with them, and to escape the devil's power? 
Such as: wearing hard shirts, flogging the body with 
scourges so that the blood is gone afterwards, walking in 
full armor to St. Jacob 2c. For, let it be that you do all 
these things and more, nevertheless it remains true that 
you are still in this present evil world and not in Christ's 
kingdom. But if you are not in Christ's kingdom, it is 
certain that you are still in the devil's kingdom, which St. 
Paul here calls "the evil world. As long as you are not 
saved from it through faith in Christ, "who gave himself 
for your sin," you must always remain in it, and in short 
no one can save you from it. Moreover, all the gifts you 
have, whether spiritual or bodily, such as wisdom, 
outward righteousness and holiness, skill of speech, 
power, beauty, riches, and the like, are nothing else but 
a proper instrument of diabolical and infernal tyranny, so 
that you must serve Satan and promote and increase his 
kingdom. 


1) Here the Erlangen edition, first and second edition, reprinted 
from Walch: 1 John 5:20. 
2) Thus the Wittenbergers. In the other editions: hypocritical. 





32. For the first: The wiser and more pious you are, 
without the knowledge and faith of Christ, the more 
vehemently you persecute the right doctrine, blasoheme 
and condemn it for heresy and lies of the devil; on the 
other hand, you accept error and lies for God's word, and 
defend them for truth, hate and will be heartily against 
all those who teach, hear and confess God's word 
purely, yes, condemn them as deceivers and heretics, 
and think you are doing right and well. After that, you 
dare to darken and obscure divine truth and knowledge 
with your lies and deceitfulness, seduce people with 
false teachings so that they cannot come to the 
knowledge of Christ. Item, you praise and extol your own 
holiness and righteousness, but the holiness of Christ, 
by which alone we become holy and righteous, you 
curse and condemn 3) in the worst way, as if it were a 
completely ungodly and devilish thing. Finally, by thy 
power thou destroyest the kingdom of Christ, abusing it 
to cut off and destroy the gospel with it, to persecute and 
murder Christ's servants with it, together with all those 
who hear and love it 2c. Therefore thy wisdom, if thou 
be apart from Christ, is twofold foolishness; thy holiness 
and righteousness twofold sin and blasphemy. Not only 
do you know nothing about God's wisdom and 
righteousness, but you also obscure, hinder, 
blaspheme, and persecute them in a most glorious way. 

For this reason St. Paul may well call the world a bad 
world, for where it wants to be most pious and best, there 
it is most evil. In the saints of works, sensible and 
learned people it wants to be most pious and best, and 
yet there it is doubly evil. | will not now think of the gross

The first thing is that all the sins that we want to atone 
for and escape from the devil's power are nothing but filth 
and dung, so that even if we melt them all together in one 
pile, we still won't be able to bend a single hair on the 
devil's head. Let all such powers of free will, all 
hypocritical righteousness, all monasticism, masses, 
services, vows, hard shirts 2c. and other abominations 
of the antichristian empire, by which the pure doctrine is 
suppressed, should only be freely trampled underfoot 
and spat upon as the most poisonous pestilence of the 
devil, but on the other hand exalt and magnify the glory 
and unspeakable good deed of our dear Lord Jesus 
Christ, who saved us by his death, not from a silly, bad 
and good, but from the wicked and damned world. 

38 By this title St. Paul indicates that the world is a 
kingdom of unrighteousness, blindness, error, sin, death, 
blasphemy, despair, and eternal damnation; in sum, that 
it is the kingdom of the devil. And on the other hand, that 
the kingdom of Christ is a kingdom of righteousness, 
light, grace, forgiveness of sins, peace, comfort, eternal 
life and blessedness, into which we have been translated 
from this evil world through our dear Lord Jesus Christ, 
to whom be praise and glory together with the Father and 
the Holy Spirit forever and ever, amen. 


According to the will of God and our Father. 


(39) St. Paul sets forth and arranges all his words 
with great and special diligence, so that he may defend 
the doctrine of his gospel, and especially the main part 
of justification, against the false, deceiving teachers. 
Christ, he says, has saved us from the wicked kingdom 
of the devil and this world; and that he has done this has 
pleased the Father, who has so willed and ordained it. 
From this it must ever follow that we are not saved by 
our own will or running, not by our own counsel, will or 
ability, work or merit, but by God's mercy and gracious 
will 2c. There you can see how powerfully and 
abundantly St. Paul explains the teaching of the 





He knows how to sharpen all his words finely and to 
direct them at the false apostles, that he would like to 
keep the Galatians and all Christians in the truth and 
pure doctrine, and to beat the lies of his opponents to the 
ground. But it did not help, and still does not help, 
because the world is and remains the world. 

40 We should take this teaching and comfort from 
these words: "According to the will of God" 2c. that God's 
gracious will is that no one should be lost, but that 
everyone should be saved, as He also teaches in 1 
Timothy 2:4, and Christ Himself says, John 6:39: "This is 
the will of the Father who sent me, that | should not lose 
anything" 2c. But because our misery and sorrow could 
not be helped by our works, merits, sacrifices, law- 
keeping, as the Scriptures testify from time to time, as 
Psalm 40, 7: "Sacrifice and meal offering are not 
pleasing to thee"; Psalm 51, 18: "Thou hast no pleasure 
in sacrifice"; Psalm 143, 2: "Before thee no living man is 
righteous"; Gal. 2, 16: "By the work of the law no flesh is 
justified": God, who is rich in mercy, so loved this 
present, evil and damned world, that He gave His only 
begotten Son, that He might take their sin upon Himself, 
die on the cross, and thus do enough for it. Whoever 
then believes in him shall not only be saved from sin and 
death, but also have grace, righteousness and eternal 
life. 

41. If the devil now creeps in unawares, and puts 
these words out of your sight, and tells you that you 
should worry whether you have been provided by God 
for eternal blessedness or not; holds before you the 
terrible examples of God's wrath and judgment, and that 
the number of the elect is small, the number of the 
damned is great: Be wise then, and by all means do not 
let yourself be led into such perilous thoughts and 
disputations, or you will surely get lost and break your 
neck; but resist, and say: | am not commanded to be 
concerned about such things, which are too high and 
incomprehensible for me to investigate; | stick to the 
words of St. Paul, who says: Christ is the only one who 
knows the truth. Pauli, who says: that Christ gave himself 
for our sin, that he might save us 2c., and has done this 
according to the will of God, and 


796 Ex. (S.) SSL, 169-171. explanation of the saying Gal. 1, 4. 5. 


of our Father. From this | can certainly conclude that 
before God would allow us to be lost, Christ, His only 
Son, our Lord, must become the servant of us all, take 
upon Himself and bear all our sin and shame, suffer the 
temptation of the devil, be forsaken by God for a little 
while, Ps. 8:6, wrestle with death, sweat blood over it, 
and finally die the most humiliating death on the cross. | 
can neither see nor recognize anything else in God, but 
only grace, mercy, patience, compassion 2c. with us 
miserable, afflicted sinners. The Scriptures testify to 
this, that God does not respect the reputation of man, 
but that all, no one excluded, who call upon His name 
shall be saved. If many are lost, it is the fault of the devil 
and our evil will, for God the Father's will, says St. Paul, 
is a good, gracious will; and John 6:40, Christ Himself 
says: "This is the will of Him who sent Me, that whoever 
sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life. 


God and our Father. 


The little word "Our" should be interpreted to both 
words "God" and "Father", so that this is the opinion: By 
the will of our God and our Father. For it is He who is 
our Father, who is Christ's Father, as Christ says John 
20:17 to Magdalene: "Go to my brothers and tell them: | 
ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my GOD, 
and to your GOD." Of it further in the Easter sermon.

W. IX, 408f. 


To whom be glory forever and ever, Amen. 

(43) The Jews, according to their peculiar custom, 
commonly include much praise and thanksgiving in their 
writings; which custom and manner the apostles, being 
Jews themselves, also observe, as may be seen in 
many instances in St. Paul's writings. For one should 
ever honor the name of the Lord, and never mention it 
without praise and thanksgiving. And this way is a fine 
reverence and service to our Lord God. Just as in the 
regiment of the world, when great kings or princes are 
called by their names, it is customary to show reverence 
to them by bowing the head and bending the knees 2c. 
Now rather, when we speak of God, we should bow our 
hearts to him with reverence, and call his name with 
gratitude and all reverence; especially because we hear 
here that he is our God and Father through Christ, who 
not only will not be angry with us from now on, nor 
punish and condemn us eternally because of our sin, as 
he might justly do: But also counts us righteous and just, 
because of faith in Christ, who is our adornment, whom 
we put on in baptism, and also wants to give us the 
heavenly inheritance, namely eternal life, joy and 
blessedness. He does all this out of pure grace and 
mercy: therefore we can do or give him nothing in return, 


but sing an alleluia or Te Deum laudamus, and say with 


St. Paul: To him be praise, honor and glory, from 
everlasting to everlasting, Amen.

D. D. Martin Luther's Sermon on the Difference between the Law and 
the Gospel on Gal. 3, 23. 24. *) 


Held the 1st of January 1532. 


Gal. 3, 23. 24 But before faith came, we were kept 
under the law and closed to the faith that was to be 
revealed. So the law was our disciplinarian unto 
Christ, that we might be justified by faith 2c. 


1 St. Paul's opinion is this: That in Christianity both 
preachers and hearers should teach and grasp a certain 
distinction between the law and the gospel, between 
works and faith; as he also commands Timothy to do, 
when he exhorts him, 2 Ep. 2, 15, to rightly divide the 
word of truth 2c. For this distinction between the law and 
the gospel is the highest art in Christianity, which all and 
every one who boast or accept the Christian name 
should be able and know. For where this part is lacking, 
a Christian cannot be recognized before a Gentile or a 
Jew; so much so is it due to this difference. 

2 For this reason, St. Paul insists that these two 
teachings, namely the Law and the Gospel, be well and 
truly separated from one another among Christians. 
Both are the Word of God, the Law or the Ten 
Commandments, and the Gospel; the former initially in 
Paradise, the latter on Mount Sinai, given by God. But in 
this lies the power to distinguish the two words correctly, 
and not to mix them together, otherwise one will neither 
know nor be able to keep the right understanding of this 
nor of that; indeed, if one thinks that one has both of 
them, one will have neither. 


*This sermon was first published in 1532 in Wittenberg by Hans 


3) Under the papacy it has happened 1) that neither 
the pope nor all his scholars, cardinals, bishops and 
high schools have never known what gospel or law is; 
indeed, they have never tasted it or reported in all their 
books how one is to be distinguished from the other, 
how the teaching of the law should or could be 
separated from the gospel. Therefore their faith, though 
they come to the highest, is a mere Turkish faith, which 
stands only on the mere letter of the law and outward 
doings, as: Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal 2c.; 
thus they think that the law has been done enough, if 
one only does not kill with the fist, nor steal someone's 
own, and so on. Yes, they think that such outward piety 
is a righteousness that is valid before God 2c. But such 
teaching and faith, even though the works are good and 
commanded by God, is wrong and unjust. For the law 
demands much higher righteousness than that which is 
based on outward virtues and piety. In addition, the 
gospel of grace and the forgiveness of sins is even 
thereby defeated. For though not stealing, not killing, is 
right, and is required by the law, yet it is no more than a 
heathen piety, which does not attain to the 
righteousness of the law; much less is it forgiveness of 
sins, of which the gospel teaches and preaches. 

4 Itis therefore highly necessary that these two words 
be properly and well distinguished;

edition"), because the text of both the Nuremberg printing and the Wittenberg collective edition, almost word for word, is completely contained 
in that of the Jena edition. To us, the triple reproduction of this sermon would seem to be an unnecessary? burden on our edition.

that where this does not happen, neither the law nor the 
gospel can be understood, and consciences must perish 
in blindness and error. For the law has its purpose, how 
far it is to go and what it is to accomplish, namely, up to 
Christ, to frighten the impenitent with God's wrath and 
displeasure. Likewise, the gospel has its special office 
and work, to preach forgiveness of sins to the afflicted 
conscience. Therefore, let these two not be mixed 
together without distorting the doctrine, nor let one be 
taken for the other. For the Law and the Gospel are both 
the Word of God, but not the same doctrine. Just as this 
is God's word, Ex. 28, 12: "You shall honor your father 
and your mother." And again Eph. 6, 2. 3. 4.: "Fathers, 
bring up your children in the fear of God" 2c. But because 
it is not spoken of one office and person, what disorder 
would result if it were to be thrown together with the 
appearance that it was all God's word? Then the son 
would want to be father, the father would want to be son; 
the mother daughter, the daughter mother. But this 
rhymes badly and is not to be suffered. Therefore, the 
father should do what he is commanded by God to do; 
likewise, the son should keep to his profession. So also 
it behooves a housemother to bear, nurse and rear 
children; a husband to care for his house and servants, 
and to be faithful to them; not to bear children, 1) clean, 
wipe and wait 2c. Now if one wanted to take hold of the 
other's commanded office, or if one of them wanted to 
be both, what kind of wild, desolate being would this 
become? Therefore the word must be _ rightly 
distinguished, so that each one may preside over his 
profession and office, 2) stay with it, and not go further, 
so that he will not err. 

(5) What else did Thomas Muenzer bring to the 
terrible lamentation, except that he read in the books of 
the kings how David slew the wicked with the sword, how 
Joshua slew the Canaanites, the Hittites and other 
wicked nations in the land of Canaan? 

1) The Wittenberg offers here: "Zeugen" for which 


"sengen" (to suckle) should be read. 
2) Jenaer: | see. 


2c. He found the word and concluded from it: We must 
do the same to him, suppress the kings and princes in 
the regiment, for here we have an example of this. What 
else was lacking here in Muenzer, but that he did not 
distinguish the word correctly, and made his calculation 
thus: David has indeed received. But am | also David? 
The word that David has received is not my business; if 
he is commanded to receive, to slay the kings, then | am 
commanded to preach. If Muenzer had left it at that, and 
taught the gospel purely in the pulpit, according to 
Christ's command: "Go into all the world and preach the 
gospel to every creature," 2c., then he would not have 
gotten into such terrible teaching and turmoil. For to 
David, and not to Muenzer, it is said: You shall protect 
the pious, punish the wicked with the sword and keep 
peace 2c. But if David were to leave such a thing, and 
subvert himself to the priestly office, and | were to leave 
off preaching, and wield the sword, and so mix all things 
together: what a praiseworthy rule and great art would 
that be? which even sows and cows could well do! 

(6) Therefore | say again, that it is a very great art to 
separate the law and the gospel rightly from one 
another, because it is necessary to do so also in the 
commandments (which are all comprehended under the 
one word "law"), and to separate one from the other, 
where one does not want everything to go through one 
another, yes, over and over, because it still has defects 
and deficiencies, since everything is distinguished rightly 
and well. 

Therefore, it is great foolishness to pretend that it is 
God's word, God's word, therefore it is right 2c. Yes, 
God's word is not one, but distinct. The law is another 
word than the gospel; so the laws or commandments are 
also not one. For this word of God: Protect the pious, 
punish the wicked, does not concern me, just as this 
word: You shall bear children, suckle, wipe, wait 2c., 
concerns women alone. Again: You shall preach, 
administer the sacraments, belongs not to women, but 
to men, who are called to do so. 

8. our people know about this difference.

The same is true of the law and the gospel, but if it is 
necessary in laws to distinguish them from one another 
and to look at the persons to whom they are directed, 
how much more is there a distinction between the law 
and the gospel? But if it is necessary in laws to 
distinguish them from one another, and to look rightly at 
the persons to whom they are directed, how much more 
is the distinction to be made between the law and the 
gospel! Therefore, let him who is well able in this art of 
separating the Law from the Gospel, set him first, and 
call him a Doctor of the Holy Scriptures. For without the 
Holy Spirit it is impossible to make this distinction. | 
experience it in myself, and see it daily in others, how 
difficult it is to distinguish between the teaching of the 
Law and the Gospel. The Holy Spirit must be master and 
teacher here, or no man on earth will be able to 
understand or teach 1). Therefore, no pope, no false 
Christian, no fanatic will be able to separate these two, 


especially in causa materiali et in objecto. 

2) By the law nothing is to be understood other than 
God's word and commandment, in which he gives us 
what we are to do and not to do, and demands our 
obedience or work from us. This is easy to understand 


in causa formali, but very difficult in causa finali. The 
laws or commandments that speak of works that God 
requires of each one in particular, according to nature, 
status, office, time, and other circumstances, are many 
and varied. Therefore, they also tell every man what God 
has commanded and requires of him according to his 
nature and office; as, the wife shall keep the children, 
the householder shall rule 2c. This is her commandment. 
Aservant shall be obedient to his master, and what more 
belongs to a servant's office. Similarly, a maid also has 
her command. The common law that applies to all of us 
is this, Matth. 22, 39: "You shall love your neighbor as 
yourself," advise and help him in his need as it arises: if 
he is hungry, feed him; if he is naked, clothe him, and 
what is more. That is to say, to circumscribe the law 
properly, and to measure it out from the Gospel, namely- 


1) Wittenberger: learn. 
2) The following two paragraphs were erroneously given the numbers 
7 and 8 in Walch's old edition, so we have omitted them. 


The law is called and is that which presses upon our 
works. 

On the other hand, the gospel or faith is such a 
teaching or word of God that does not demand our 
works, nor does it command us to do anything, but tells 
us to badly accept the offered grace of forgiveness of 
sins and eternal blessedness and to let it be given to us. 
We do nothing, but only receive and let ourselves be 
given what is given and offered to us through the word 
that God promises and lets you say: | give you this and 
that 2c. When, in baptism, which is not my making, nor 
my work, but God's word and work, he saith unto me, 
Hold, | baptize thee, and wash thee from all thy sins; 
receive it, it shall be thine. If then you are baptized in this 
way, what more do you do than to receive and accept 
such a gift of grace? Now the difference between the 
Law and the Gospel is this: by the Law we are required 
to do what we want to do, urging our work against God 
and our neighbor; but in the Gospel we are required to 
make a donation or rich alms, since we are to receive 
God's grace and eternal blessedness. 

9 This difference is easy to notice from this: The 
gospel gives us God's gift, help or salvation, and only 
tells us to hold out our sackcloth and let God give us 
something; the law, however, gives nothing, but takes 
and demands something from us. Now the two, giving 
and taking, are very far apart. For if something is given 
to me, | do nothing to it, but take and receive it, and let it 
be given to me. Again, when | do in my profession what 
| am commanded to do, item, counsel and help my 
neighbor, | receive nothing, but give to another whom | 


serve. Thus the law and gospel are distinguished formali 


causa; the one promises, the other gives. Gospel gives 
and means to take; law demands and says: You shall do 
this. Just as when a prince or feudal lord gives or lends 
his property to a nobleman, the nobleman does nothing, 
it is not his work, but the prince's gift; but when he rides 
to serve his lord or to court, 3) then he does something.

| have not done this and that, | am unjust and a sinner 
written in God's register of guilt, | must confess that it is 
all true. But | must not concede the implication: Therefore 
you are condemned, but | must defend myself with strong 
faith and say: According to the law, which reckons my 
guilt to me, | am indeed a poor, condemned sinner, but | 
appeal from the law to the gospel, for God has given 
another word above the law, that is, the gospel, which 
gives us His grace, forgiveness of sins, eternal 
righteousness and life, and also sets you free from your 
terror and condemnation, and comforts me that all guilt 
has been paid by the Son of God, Jesus Christ Himself. 
Therefore, it is highly necessary to know how to direct 
and act both words, and to diligently see that they are not 
mixed up with each other. 

For God has given these two words, law and gospel, 

one as well as the other, and each with its command: the 
law, which demands perfect righteousness from 
everyone; the gospel, which gives the righteousness 
required by the law to those who do not have it (that is, 
to all men) by grace. Whoever, then, has not done 
enough for the law, and lies imprisoned in sin and death, 
let him turn from the law to the gospel, believing the 
preaching of Christ, that he is truly the little lamb of God, 
who bears the sin of the world, reconciles his heavenly 
Father, and gives eternal righteousness, life and 
blessedness to all who believe him, purely free of charge 
and by grace. To this sermon alone he adheres, calls on 
Christ, asks for grace and forgiveness of sins, believes 
firmly (because only with faith this great gift is grasped), 
then he has, as he believes. 
(17) This is the right distinction, and the whole power lies 
in making it right. It can be preached or separated with 
words, but to bring it into practice is a high art and difficult 
to achieve. The papists and enthusiasts do not know it at 
all; so | see it also in myself and others who know best 
how to talk about how difficult this difference is. The art 
is common: soon it is spoken how the law is another word 
and doctrine than the gospel; 





but to distinguish practice and to put the art into work is 
effort and work. St. Jerome also wrote much of this, but 
like a blind man of color. They call the law that one must 
circumcise, sacrifice, not eat this and that 2c. Then they 
make a new law out of the Gospel, which teaches how 
to pray and fast, how to become a monk or a nun, or to 
go to church 2c. And this is called distinguishing them. 
Yes, it rather means thrown into each other. For they 
themselves know not what they wash. Therefore hear 
St. Paulum, who teaches thee that thou must come 
higher than how to be circumcised or not to be 
circumcised 2c. (for that is all, to be kept and shut up 
under the law), namely, to faith in Christ, by which we 
become the children of God and eternally blessed; or 
remain under the prison and wrath of God. 

(18) It is true that the law or the ten commandments 
have not been abolished in such a way that we are now 
free from them in all things, and may not have them. (For 
Christ has delivered us from the curse, not from the 
obedience of the law.) No, he does not mean that, but 
that we should keep them with all earnestness and 
diligence; but, where we have done so, not to trust in 
them, nor, where we have not done so, to despair. 
Therefore see to it that you discern the two words aright, 
not giving more to the law than is due to it, or you will 
lose the gospel. Neither should you regard the gospel 
and think about it in such a way that the law perishes, 
but let each remain in its circle and circle. Just as one 
must not preach that there should be no authority or no 
preaching chair, but should distinguish between the two 
persons and offices, so that each remains in its office 
and provides for it: the authority according to its land law, 
as far as that extends; the preacher according to his 
teaching office. In the mayor's office | do not take part, 
but separate myself from him, as winter and summer. 
For my office is to preach, to baptize, to bring souls to 
heaven, and to comfort poor, afflicted hearts 2c. But it is 
the duty of the authorities to keep the peace, so that the 
dear youth may be brought up in the fear and discipline 
of God.

study, or comfort people with God's word. 

19 So it is necessary to distinguish rightly. Not as the 
pope does, who is neither dog nor dog, neither prince nor 
bishop, and yet wants to have both under him, wears 
caps and plates 1) for his own cover of shame; likewise 
do his bishops/ who are also neither bishops nor princes. 
But thus shalt thou do unto him: If thou find thyself in the 
meeting that the law would condemn thee, know that not 
only the law is given of God, but also, which is much 
higher word, the dear gospel of Christ. Now if both, law 
and gospel, come up against each other, and the law 
finds me a sinner, accuses and condemns me; but the 
gospel says, Matth. 9, 2: "Be of good cheer, your sins are 
forgiven you", you shall be blessed; both are God's word; 
but which one should | follow here? This is what St. Paul 
teaches you: "When faith comes (he says), we are no 
longer under the disciplinarian", then the law ceases. For 
it should and must, as the lesser word, give place and 
room to the Gospel. Both are 2) God's word, the law and 
the gospel; but they are not both equal. One is lower, the 
other higher; one weaker, the other stronger; one lesser, 
the other greater. Now when they wrestle with each 
other, | follow the gospel, and say, Good-bye, law! It is 
better not to know the law than to forsake the gospel. 

20. for as it is in the law, when GOD commands Ex 
20:7: "You shall not take my name in vain," 2c. and your 
ruler or your parents command you: You shall deny GOD 
or his gospel. Here GOD says: Honor my name; and the 
law: You shall love GOD more than your neighbor. Here 
| am to leave the least commandment (obedience to 
men) and let it perish, and keep the highest 
commandment of the first tablet (which is to be the other 
of all masters), and be obedient to that alone. Rather, 
these things must be kept when the law urges me to keep 
Christ,

| will rather leave the law and say, "Dear law, if | have 
not done the works, you do them; | will not be tortured to 
death, imprisoned or held under you for your sake, and 
so forget the gospel. If | have sinned, done wrong, or not 
done wrong, | will let you, the law, take care of it. Roll 
thou over, and let my heart be content; | will not know 
thee therein. But if you demand and want me to be 
righteous here on earth, | will gladly do it; but if you want 
to climb in and break my heart, so that | lose what has 
been given to me, | would much rather not know you at 
all than let the gift go. 

21 Paul wants to teach us this difference when he 
says: The law has served to imprison us 2c. For it must 
also have it to imprison and compel the children and 
brute people with it, as it is, Thou shalt honor thy father 
and thy mother; thou shalt not commit adultery, thou 
shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill 2c. For the old man must 
be bound and imprisoned under the law, so that it keeps 
us inside, drives us and demands of us, so that we do 
not live wantonly. But such constraint and imprisonment 
shall not last long, 3) until the gospel is made manifest 
and known, how we are to believe in Christ. Then | say: 
Law, lift yourself up, | do not want to be captivated by 
you in my heart any longer, that | should trust that | have 
done this and that, or despair that | have not done it. 
Faith gives me here a heavenly sermon, which is the 
gospel, that the law may no more hurt the afflicted and 
bruised heart; it hath martyred and staggered enough. 
Therefore, you should now give room to the gospel, 
which gives us the grace and mercy of God. 

(22) St. Paul intends this in Christianity, and it can 
soon be distinguished by the words and their nature, and 
also by the fruits (what each of these two works or 
accomplishes). For it is twofold, to take and to give, to 
terrify and to make glad. The law requires of us and 
terrifies; the

But the gospel gives us and comforts us. But to separate 
these things in USU, or to bring them to work, when these 
two words, law and gospel, come together in the 
conscience, so that you can then rightly separate them 
and say: | want to have the two words unmixed, but each 
assigned to its place, in sua materia, the law for the old 
Adam, the gospel for my stupid, frightened conscience 
(for | now have no need of a driver to good works, much 
less can | suffer its accusation, after | have been all too 
harshly accused by my own conscience, not only 
accused, but convicted, but need comfort and help from 
the gospel of Jesus Christ); 1) Now to do this is very 
difficult, especially when the law wants to take over the 
conscience. See then that you take hold of the promise, 
and do not let the law gain the upper hand, nor rule in 
your conscience, and thereby come into judgment, for 
then the gospel would be denied. But you must cast 
yourself about, and take hold of the word of grace or 
gospel of the forgiveness of sins,

the Jena edition alone.

that God has also commanded to preach the gospel to 
the poor, in which He will not play by the rules with you, 
but will act according to His grace as a kind father toward 
His poor child, that He will forgive by grace all that you 
have not done, and what you cannot do, He will give all 
to you. 

023 So the law alone is to press for outward 
discipline, and to leave the chamber wherein the gospel 
is to dwell satisfied; as he saith, "Before faith came, we 
were determined under the law." Therefore, in addition 
to the law, and above the law, another word must come, 
namely, the gospel, which sets us in a strange godliness, 
which is apart from us in Christ alone. For this reason it 
is impossible that we should be justified by the law, for it 
has been tried before more than it can do. Therefore it is 
undeniable that no man shall be justified by the work of 
the law. For if it were possible, it would have happened 
long ago. Therefore another and higher word belongs to 
this, which is the gospel and faith in Christ, as has been 
said. God grant us grace and strengthen our faith, amen!

the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the 
armor of God, that you may be able to stand against 
the crafty attempts of the devil. For we have not with 


the lords of the world who rule in the darkness of this 
world, with the evil spirits under heaven. For this 
reason, take hold of the armor of God, so that 


*The old editions place this sermon on the epistle of the twenty-first Sunday after Trinity in the year 1532, but the first single print of it 
was published only in 1533 by Georg Rau (Rhaw) at Wittenberg under the title: "The sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, about 
the Christians' armor and weapons, preached by D. Mart. Mart. Luther." In the collective editions: in the Wittenberg (1556), vol. |, p. 4131";

W. ix, 430-433. 





You may resist in the evil day, and do all things well, 
and keep the field. Stand therefore, having your loins 
girded with truth, and clothed with the cancer of 
righteousness, and your legs booted, as ready to 
advance the gospel of peace, that ye may be prepared. 
Above all, take hold of the shield of faith, with which 
you can quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. 
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the 
Spirit, which is the word of God. 


(1) This is the last part of Paul's epistle to the 
Ephesians, and not a doctrine how they should believe 
and live (which he did before through the whole epistle), 
but an exhortation that they take heed, because they 
have the doctrine of faith, and know what every man 
ought to do in his state as a Christian, that they abide in 
the same, and not turn from it to any other thing. And do 
as a pious, righteous captain of the field who serves his 
people in battle order. He preaches a sermon to his 
people in battle order, exhorting them to stand firm and 
defend themselves boldly and confidently, so that it may 
well be called a sermon to the Christians. For he shows 
that those who have been baptized into Christ and want 
to cling to him must and should be warriors, always 
armed with their weapons and armor, and that the 
Christian state is not an idle state, nor a state of peace 
and security, but that it is a matter of always being in the 
field and fighting, and stretching the man to it. For we do 
not sit here in peace, like a farmer, citizen or craftsman 
in a city, where he lives in peace and may fear nothing, 
but lie in a yearly place, in the midst of enemies and 
murderers, who mean us seriously, and want to take our 
treasure wherever we can, and are not safe from them 
for a moment. Therefore, whoever wants to be a 
Christian must think that he should join his Lord's ensign 
and, because he lives here, be at the forefront without 
ceasing, and be aware of the enemies on all sides. 

2 Because we are and live in such a journey every 
day, it is necessary that we be awakened by the Word of 
God, as by our kettledrums and trumpets, and that we be 
urged and encouraged that 


We do not snore, nor become lazy and sluggish, but are 
and remain always watchful and prepared. For it is not 
enough that we have the word and knowledge of faith 
and life, but it requires constant care and diligence how 
we keep both, so that the devil does not snatch away the 
doctrine, nor pervert and counterfeit it, nor lead you away 
from your position, nor incite and entice you away from 
it by wicked mouths and examples of the competition, 
yes, even by your own flesh. For it is a great art (as the 
wise say), and requires no less effort and diligence, how 
one keeps the good gained, than that one first gains it. 
Just as a good householder must not only acquire money 
and goods and bring them home, but must also be able 
to keep them and keep them in safe custody, if he is able 
to do so. These two virtues must be in harmony, 
otherwise everything is lost, effort, food and work, if one 
tries to acquire it. 

3 In this text St. Paul wants to say as a summary: 
"Since you have become Christians, have been beaten 
off by the devil, and have been brought back to your right 
Lord, and know and have received everything that 
belongs to a Christian being, see and let this be your only 
concern from now on, how you stay with it, and do not let 
yourselves be taken away from it again, neither by force 
nor by trickery, nor make yourselves tired and lazy about 
it. For you have an evil, mischievous enemy against you, 
who neither sleeps nor celebrates for a moment, who 
tries every trick and art, as he hinders you from your faith 
and ministry, and prevents you from being caught again 
and brought under himself: so he has for help the evil 
world, and your own flesh, which you carry by the neck, 
and always draws you back, so that you may become 
safe and careless, and refrain from watching and 
fighting. Therefore he began with such vain words as are 
used to address and exhort men of war, that they stand 
and fight chivalrously, saying: 


V. 10. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of 
his might. 
004 This much is said, Think ye to hold fast, and 


abide in that which ye have received, and every man of 
fine faith.

and do his office well, and do not follow or give in to the 
devil's promptings, or to his own flesh, or to the world's, 
irritation, and beware that you do not let yourselves be 
hindered, or made weary and faint, or become lazy and 
sluggish. For there it is necessary to be strong and to 
fight, because we have such an enemy (as we shall 
hear), who attacks and assails us at every turn with all 
his power and strength, and stirs us up without ceasing, 
with evil thoughts and poisonous, harmful tongues, filling 
both our ears and our hearts, that we should not heed the 
good word, nor pursue it with earnestness, and in our| 
position or office become careless, heedless, 


says as he usually speaks, and as we are wont to speak 
when we deliver the doctrine: Let every man take heed 
that he believe aright, and do that which he is 
commanded. But here he speaks with diligence and for 
a reason such powerful words: Strengthen yourselves or 
be strong. Namely, as has been said, that he who is to 
abide by this teaching and his ministry must equip 
himself and need strength for it. For it is not a thing that 
comes so easily, and does itself without hindrance and 
resistance, but does not go without challenge. Therefore 
it is necessary to wake up and be courageous, not to 
hear anything else, nor to be misled by what lies in the

you no longer stand firm, but sway loosely and unsteadily, 
to and fro, and fall from one to the other, both in doctrine 
and life. 

5 For "to be strong in the Lord" means to stand firm 
and steadfast in the doctrine received from the Lord, 
which teaches us how to believe in Christ, and to live 
according to it, so that each one may serve his neighbor] 
in his position and profession, and wait for him faithfully 
and diligently. So, whoever wants to be a pious preacher 
or pastor, he has his hands full, so that he conducts his, 
office rightly, preaches purely and loudly, exhorts, prays 
and watches, so that the devil does not secretly cause 
sectarianism and hinder him in his office, or let himself be 
made disgruntled and impatient by the ingratitude of the| 


continuing. For he does not want such loose Christians, 
who bring nothing more from it than knowledge and 
washing, and do not think how they bring it into life; but 
that they think that it must be lived and done. Therefore 
a strength belongs to it, and such strength that is of God, 
not of the world, nor of flesh and blood; namely, as | have 
now said, that each one (who is instructed by God's 
word, so that he knows how he should stand before God 
and live rightly) think to himself: | will remain in this, and 
know no other, nor hear and follow any other; so that he 
may be able to stand, if some spirit of the wicked should 
come, and want to dislodge from him the doctrine and 
understanding of Christ, or to draw and provoke a 
useless mouth from his commanded office and works.

(8) But it is a strange strength and nothing at all in the 
sight of the world, because it has no more and can do no 
more than to be founded on the word and to hold it. | 
wept, if it were to be such a great strength, it would have 
to have another foundation, be built on a strong rock, or 
lie in a solid castle, where no one could take it away, and 
put on a good suit of armor, armed and guarded with 
military strength, spears and rifles; that is what the world 
would call it: strengthened. But all this is and holds 
nothing against this enemy, the devil, but must be a 
spiritual, eternal strength, which is the Lord Christ, 
grasped in his word through faith. And even though it is 
not seen and does not appear before the eyes how 
strong he is, yet he is man enough for the devil, so that 
whoever clings to him can well resist all his power and 
authority and offer defiance, as he has remained with his 
own until now, and still remains. 

(9) Therefore he says: If you want to be strong and 
unconquerable, let the Lord Christ be your strength; take 
hold of him and exercise yourselves well in him, that he 
may be well known to you, and that you may keep his 
word pure, and learn it with all diligence, handle it daily, 
and put it into the heart, so that the word of God and your 
hearts may become one thing, and you may be as sure 
of it and much more certain of it than you are of your own 
life. When you have this, you are quite strong and firm, 
so that you can remain undisturbed and secure, even if 
the devil or his messengers, enthusiasts or pabstrotts 
come to teach and lead you differently, or to raise 
something new and different. 

(10) But such strength is strange in the world. For 
how many are they now, who so take up the cause, that 
they are so sure of their faith and life in their hearts, that 
they can hold fast to it, and despise all other things? Yes, 
the whole world does not come to think that it has God's 
word and to live according to it, and does not desire it 
anywhere, but despises it in the highest and most certain 
way, lives according to all its will, against God's word, 
and only strengthens itself in its wickedness and devilish 
nature, not caring how it becomes strong in the Lord. But 
we are now talking about those who 





Those who want to be Christians and take the word 
seriously have trouble and work with it, and must defend 
themselves with all their might, lest they also fall into 
such a nature, that they do not respect the word, nor 
faithfully wait for their profession. 

(11) For as the devil cannot leave faith unchallenged, 
that he may pluck us from the word; so also he cannot 
leave life in peace, and hath no rest till he make thee 
stagger: then he putteth such thoughts into the heart, 
that thou shalt be weary of thy estate, and shalt be 
displeased and impatient. He who is not equipped to 
stand firm, nor to defend himself with the word, is soon 
overthrown, as he does to others, whom he rules with 
displeasure and weariness of their position, so that no 
one pleases him with his position and work. The pagans 
themselves complain about this, as they have seen and 
felt it everywhere, how it is a harmful plague that no one 
is content with his position and office, but always looks 
for another, and considers it better; and as they say: An 
ox would like to be a horse, and again, the horse would 
like to be an ox; a peasant or citizen would like to be a 
nobleman, the nobleman a prince, the prince an emperor 
2c. From unwillingness follows disloyalty, that no one 
diligently attends to his commanded office and work, but 
despises it, and undertakes another, or deceives his 
neighbor therein, and does wrong. 

(12) Therefore, just as by the word we must make 
ourselves firm and sure in the Lord against the 
temptation of unbelief, or contempt of it; so we also have 
to manage here to fortify ourselves with the same word 
of the Lord, which is our own strength and armor (as we 
shall hear), so that we remain firm in our profession, 
knowing that God is heartily pleased with such our state 
and work as is set forth in His commandment, and can 
do no better. 

(13) So every servant or maidservant in the house 
should regard their estate and work as appointed by God 
to serve their masters faithfully, saying, "| know that my 
estate and work are pleasing to God, and that there is no 
good work on earth; for God has commanded me no 
other: therefore 


818 en. (s.) 18, s2s-130. Interpretation on the epistle to the Ephesians. w.1x, 438-441. 


819 








| also want to stay with it, and not let myself be torn away 
from it by another, nor let myself be moved to impatience 
or infidelity. Likewise, a pious wife, if she is a Christian, 
and knows and believes God's word, and waits for it in 
her station, does the most delicious works on earth, so 
that she may not seek anything else, nor go into a 
convent or a cloister; but only remain firm in this, and say: 
My Lord Christ has suffered for me, and by his death has 
saved me, and redeemed me from sins, and made me 
righteous and saved, and asks no more of me than that | 
believe these things, and bids me diligently wait for my 
ministry; and | will abide in it. Behold, if each one should 
strengthen himself in his position or office and make 
himself firm on God's word, then it would go right and well 
everywhere, and we would have a paradise, yes, a 
kingdom of heaven here on earth, and each one could do 
his work with pleasure and joy, without all effort and 
worry. On the other hand, where such a certain and firm 
mind is not there, it does evil and with unwillingness, and 
gets pranks or misfortune for wages, and makes him both 
an ungracious God, and a sour life in addition. 


And in the power of his strength 2c. 


(14) This is spoken obscurely, and neither well i 
German, Latin, nor Greek, but even in Hebrew. But w 
must keep the words, for he had cause to speak as h 
who sees and thinks further than we are wont to speak 
We spoke it with more words in our own way: "Stand fir 
and hold fast, so that you do not become slothful an 
lazy, nor default in what you are about to do, and tha 
each one of you should do it, and think that such teachin 
is the word of God, who has commanded it in this way 
and it is pleasing to Him as a right service of God 2c. Bu 
this is spoken much higher and stronger, that he says, | 
ye do these things, ye are strong in the Lord; and adds t 
this, "In the power of his might"; that is, in our language 
in his mighty strength, or in his great power. 

(15) But he puts the two things, "to be strong,” and, 
"in the power of his might," to show that there are tw 
kinds of strength which we must have. One, that we stan 
fast in that which we ought to believe and do, and not 





that is, to be strong for ourselves. The other is not only 
to keep the things we have safe and secure, and to 
protect ourselves, but also to defend ourselves so that 
they are not taken from us, and to beat back our enemies 
who come after us. As for a captain in a city, it is not only 
that he keep the city safe and keep everything in good 
custody, so that it may not be conquered and taken, but 
also that he may defend himself against the enemies and 
fall out and put them to flight. The first is so that | will not 
be overcome. The other, that | may overcome the enemy 
and be victorious. The former is a protective power, but 
the latter is called a defensive or victorious power, which 
not only stands firm and strong in itself, but can also 
advance and strike out among the enemy; more and 
greater armor is needed for this than for the first. 

16 Therefore he calls it "a power of divine strength", 
or a mighty strength of God. For we also have mighty and 
powerful enemies against us, namely the spirits in the air 
(as he will say), which are above us, and we among 
them, and their One is stronger than all men, and for this 
purpose he means us with such earnestness, and 
assails us with all his strength, when he sees that we 
have faith, and want to strengthen us in it, and directs all 
his power, guns and arrows against us, so that he 
overthrows such a fortress. For he is not pleased to let 
us begin to grasp the word and believe, but much less to 
let us continue to do so, and to arm ourselves against 
him and keep ourselves safe, lest he should win us away. 
And there are very few such people who endure such 
blows against him to the end, and conquer chivalrously, 
though they begin well; but in the battle, when it is so 
hard upon them, and continues without ceasing, they are 
wearied, and do not stand still. Just as it is not possible 
for a man to finally stand against it, unless such mighty 
strength of God is added, so that one can withstand such 
incessant storms of the enemy and always beat him 
back. 

(17) Now you may lead these things and show 
examples by all kinds of stands. As a pastor and 
preacher, it is not enough that 


820 Eri. (2.) 18, L30-S32. Sermon on Eph. 6, 10-17. 


W. IX, 441-443. 821 





that he be sure of his doctrine and faithfully carry out the 
same office, regardless of what tries to hinder him, 
poverty, contempt, ingratitude and all kinds of 
opposition; but also that he be able to counter the devil, 
to put away error and false doctrine, as St. Paul requires 
Titus 1:9. The two things are required: that a bishop 
should not only be so skillful as to keep the word, which 
is sure, both to teach and to exhort, but also be able, by 
the same wholesome doctrine, to punish the gainsayers 
and to shut the mouths of the useless washers. For this 
is never lacking, where the word or the doctrine is acted 
upon purely and loudly, the devil sends his messengers 
as soon as possible, and sows his weeds; then it must 
be resisted that they be put down, and the error rooted 
out. Although it is not possible to shut the mouth of the 
devil and his spirits in such a way that they stop and 
keep quiet, it is enough that they are driven in and their 
business is shifted in such a way that they cannot 
maintain it with any semblance of success, and quite a 
few souls are cut off from them and brought out of error 
again. For Christ himself was not able to silence or 
convert his Pharisees and Sadducees, but he remitted 
them and brought them in in such a way that they could 
not raise anything against it, Matth. 22, 34. 46. 

18 Christianity must also have such people, who can 
strike down their adversaries and opponents, and take 
away the devil's armor and harness, so that he is put to 
shame; but they must have strong warriors, who have 
full control of the Scriptures, and who can put away the 
false interpretation, and take away their own sword, that 
is, the same sayings that they use, and strike them on 
the head, so that they bounce back. For they cannot all 
be so skillful as to defend the doctrine and articles of 
faith. Therefore, they must have preachers and teachers 
who study the Scriptures daily and deal with them all by 
fighting for the others. But every Christian should be so 
equipped that he is sure of his faith and doctrine for 
himself, and so ground himself with sayings from God's 
word that he can stand against the devil and also defend 
himself when he is led to another, and thus help to 
preserve and defend the doctrine. 





(19) Now this belongs to all Christians in general, that 
they maintain the doctrine and their faith, but especially 
those who hold the office of preaching; after that, in 
particular, each one for his standing, that he may defend 
the same, and thus answer the useless mouths: Do you 
not hear that God has laid this standing upon me, and 
commanded me to wait faithfully for it, and forbears by 
his wrath, if | should want to leave this standing and do 
another? This would also mean not only remaining in 
one's position, unhindered and unconquered, but also 
being defeated, rejected and refuted by God's word, 
which wants to hinder and pull us back, as St. Paul 
teaches, just before this text, chapters 5 and 6, through 
all positions, man, woman, young, old, masters, 
servants, maids 2c. For it is determined that every 
Christian, of whatever station he may be, must always 
be in the battle, since 1) the devil attacks and storms 
him with the introduction of false, evil thoughts, or by 
wicked, useless mouths, which hurry him away, without 
what our own flesh does. Therefore, it is not enough for 
us to have our castle well guarded, and to be able to 
dispose of the devil, but also to drive him away and 
strike him back by God's word than by our sword, as we 
shall hear. 


V. 11. Put on the armor of God 2c. 


20 Because he has said that we should be strong and 
have such strength with us that we can defeat the 
enemy, he now wants to explain himself and explain 
how and by what means we must do this, or what our 
armor and defense should be. First of all, he tells us to 
"put on our armor" as men of war who are to be prepared 
for battle and stand against the enemy. But he shows 
such armor, not that which is worn here on earth to 
protect the body, but which is called "God's armor". This 
may well be a strange suit of armor. Where shall we get 
it from, or where is the plater who can make such armor? 
Well, he will call it what it is and count one after the other 
what belongs to it. But here he still says in general that 
it must be a suit of armor, not a man's.

823 





For here on earth you will not find a plater who can make 
such a suit of armor to serve against the devil. For here 
there is no human strength, power, wisdom or reason 
against this enemy; he can turn it all to powder and 
ashes when he blows with his breath. Therefore, 
because you are other warriors and have other enemies 
against you, you must also have other armor than the 
world has or can make. 

(21) But he also calls it "God's armor," to show what 
cause we must fight, namely, that the war is God's own, 
and we are his warriors, fighting for him and his cause; 
therefore we must also wear his armor, that he may have 
it. As if he were to say, "You have a Lord who is the devil, 
and is after his crown and divinity; therefore, if you want 
to have him as your Lord, and keep company with him, 
and be partakers of his goods, you must also have his 
enemy against you, and set yourselves against him in 
battle and in defense. For whoever wants to be under a 
lord must also step under his ensign and have his 
enemies for enemies. Since the devil is God's enemy 
and wants to destroy his kingdom, do not think that you 
will be safe from him, but arm yourselves for war and 
with the armor, so that he himself may wage war through 
his Christianity. 

22. So he wants to give us courage herewith, whether 
we have to stand in battle and strife in the world and in 
our whole life, and suffer that everything rages and 
storms against us, so that we know that this is not for our 
sake, but for God's, and that our battle is not ours, but 
God's himself, Our struggle is not ours, but God's, and 
we are in His service, and we must comfort ourselves all 
the more that He will not abandon us, but will most 
faithfully assist and help us, so that we will not work in 
vain, but will be victorious through us. 

(23) For though he is man enough for the devil 
himself, and could with one finger, even with one word, 
ward off and control all his raging and fury, yet he wants 
to use us for this purpose, and to do a mischievous thing 
to the proud, angry spirit, to set against him and 
reproach him with being such a poor, weak man. 





He wants to strike him through such a weak vessel, and 
through us he wants to bring honor to such a proud, 
mighty enemy, so that he may prove his divine power in 
our weakness. The devil is also annoyed by this, that 
God reproaches him with such frail, loose stuff, and 
attacks us angrily and grimly, as if he wanted to smash 
us in an instant like a pile of pots. Therefore we must be 
armed against it, and also have a suit of armor to defend 
ourselves, which is not ours, but God's power and might, 
so that we do not boast or rely on ourselves as if we 
would stand against this enemy by our own might. 


That you may stand against the cunning attempts 
of the devil. 


(24) Then he begins to paint and show what kind of 
enemy we have, and how he is wont to war and attack 
us, revealing to us his plots and arts, that he may pursue 
us, that we may beware of it, and be well armed with the 
armor of God, of which he has said, and will say further. 
But he calls his warfare and art of warfare a "cunning 
attempt" to show that he is such an enemy, who is not 
only more powerful than we are (as he will say soon 
after), but also excellently mischievous and wicked, and 
directs all his warfare with cunning § and 
mischievousness, He does not attack us openly and 
freely under our eyes, as an enemy from whom we could 
beware and see where he wants to break in to us, but 
creeps around us and sees where he may secretly and 
maliciously hurry us and take us by surprise, where we 
are least careful. 

25 For you must not let him attack you when he sees 
you armed, when you have taken hold of the sword, but 
when he sees you in a state of disrepair and 
unprotected, when he can find a gap, he will sneak up 
and catch you suddenly and unawares and cut you 
down. For he is so wise and well experienced, 1) that he 
knows when we have done the

W. IX, 446-449. 825 





We are sure that he can neither create nor win anything, 
even if he attacks us with all his power, and even if he 
persecutes the whole of Christendom with tyranny, with 
raging and fury, sword, fire, water, 2c., this is not his right 
grip, nor the strongest or most powerful armor. For he 
has now learned that he cannot dampen God's kingdom 
with it, nor destroy Christianity, even if he takes life and 
limb from it; but that it only grows and becomes stronger 
through it, as it is nourished and moistened by such 
blood, so that it grows all the more beautifully and 
happily; as some of the old fathers said: that the church 
was planted by the dear apostles, but watered by the 
martyrs. Therefore he goes on, and turns to the other 
side, how he may come to us with cunning, and bring of 
the word. There he devises all kinds of cunning and 
tricks, and comes, adorned with a beautiful appearance, 
not as an enemy, but as a friend, giving us the very words 
and scriptures we have, and disguising himself of all 
things into an angel of light (as St. Paul 2 Corinthians 
2:5). Paul 2 Cor. 11, 14) and becomes a bright, snow- 
white devil, wanting to blind us so that we should not see 
his mischievousness nor notice how he deceived Evam 
through the serpent, 2 Cor. 11, 3. 

26. Now it is terrible, difficult and dangerous to fight 
and contend with such an enemy, who attacks us with 
vain wiles and wiles, and is such a clever, mischievous 
spirit that all the world's reason, wisdom and cleverness 
are nothing against him, and we should take care of him 
and perceive him on all sides, as he lurks everywhere for 
us, and seeks one gap over the other, where he catches 
us secretly, before we become aware of it; And does not 
cease, whether he has already run once or twice in vain, 
and has been beaten away, but comes again and again, 
and brings other plots, that he may charm us, and make 
a noise before our eyes, with beautiful pretence and 
appearance, that we may not see his deceitfulness and 
mischievousness. So that it would soon be lost with us, 
and we would not be able to stand an hour before his 
mischievousness, if we did not have to take comfort in 
this, and were certain that we would not be able to see 
God's armor, that is, his word, loud and clear. 


He cannot overthrow it, as long as we keep to it, and 
always stand bravely armed with it, and watch out for his 
mischievousness. For this is part of it, that we are not 
safe, nor lazy and sleepy, but always watch and look out 
for him, and with God's word be alert on all sides, as he 
prowls around us (as St. Peter says 1 Ep. 5, 8), seeking 
like a lion where he can catch us. That is why St. Paul 
paints him so horribly, that we should not take it so 
lightly, but let it be serious, and always keep our journey 
in mind, as it is important for our salvation and eternal 
life 2c. 

(27) But what and how manifold his cunning attempts 
are, we shall not be able to tell nor to conceive, without 
what we must experience with ourselves. For here he is 
master over master, and of a thousand arts, with so 
many thoughts and submissions, which he offers for 
God's word, by which he has deceived all the world from 
the beginning, and brought all kinds of heresy by force 
into Christendom. For (as | have said) he does not come 
trolling along in his hideous black color, saying: | am 
Satan, beware of me, but creeps along like a serpent, 
and adorns himself most beautifully with God's word and 
name, bringing the very Scriptures and sayings that we 
lead, love, and base ourselves on, and pretending to be 
perfectly serious and devout, as a faithful, pious 
preacher, who seeks nothing but God's glory and the 
salvation of souls. 

(28) As he is doing now through our sacramental 
rituals and others, who also lead vain writings against 
us, and want to base their thing on them, hold our own 
sayings and articles against us, and lead high, excellent 
words, Christ's honor and name, in addition to great 
earnestness to the truth, excellent love and care for 
souls. Behold, dear Christian (they say), there you have 
God's word, so your own faith holds that Christ, gone to 
heaven, sits above at the right hand of the Father, there 
you shall seek him 2c. How then comest thou that he 
should be in bread and wine, and be brought down by 
the hissing of a man over the altar 2c. O that would be 
far too close to the glory of Christ! and what more such 
words belong to it. Behold, this is a right 


826 En. (s.) 18, p37-238. Interpretation On the epistle to the Ephesians. w. ix, 449-451. 


Starting and knocking, not as of Satan, but adorned as 
of the Lord Christ's word and truth, so that he may win 
the ccrme, unintelligent and secure souls and suddenly 
snatch them away. 

(29) In the same way he did in the past through the 
Arians (who denied the article of Christ's divinity) and 
other heretics, who did not want to fight against the 
Scriptures, but led the same for themselves, and 
interpreted the Christians' opinion as against the 
Scriptures, as those who divided the divinity, and grew 
more than one God, adorned this with such a splendid 
appearance and delicious words that they attracted 
emperors and all the world to themselves with it, until 
hardly one bishop or two remained, through whom God 
received Christianity. 

(30) But after these came another attempt of the 
mischievous devil, through the works doctrine of the 
pope, against the righteousness of faith through Christ, 
so that he also so cunningly broke through the 
Scriptures, drawing from good works and outward 
righteousness, introducing great appearances of 
holiness and spiritual life. This first did the damage, and 
violently broke in like a flood, and flooded the whole 
world, and set up such a regime of the papacy, with all 
kinds of worship, masses, orders, pilgrimages, vows, 
saintly service, 2c., which were also confirmed with 
miracles (but still false) by the devil; as Christ and the 
apostles prophesied before, that even the elect would 
be led astray about this. Matth. 24, 24. 

For so it goes; where the devil first finds a gap open, 
and there are not brave preachers to defend it, he soon 
breaks through, and always tears away, until he gets the 
upper hand, and takes everything again. For he always 
comes with such beautiful pretenses, which are in 
accordance with reason and human wisdom, and which 
she can understand and comprehend, and which 
naturally please her, so that she gladly gives herself up, 
and then he takes everything with his breath, as if it were 
a delicious thing, so that no one can resist. For it 
requires a higher, spiritual mind, which has and keeps 
God's word pure and clear, so that it can recognize and 
refute it. Therefore, in Christianity there should and must 
be intelligent and 


827 


faithful preachers and bishops who watch over all places 
and see to it that no devilish creatures creep in secretly 
and gain a breach. That is why they are called bishops, 


episcopi, that is, watchmen and overseers, who should 
be on the lookout for where the enemy wants to come in 
and chase him back; otherwise he would easily break 
through and ruin everything. 

32 For if he can bring himself to be granted articles in 
one, he has won, and is just as much as if he had them 
all, and Christ had already lost them, and after that he 
can also break up and take all the others; for they are all 
wound and closed into one another, like a golden chain, 
so that where one link is broken up, the whole chain is 
broken up, and everything goes from one to the other. 
And there is no article that he cannot overturn when he 
causes reason to fall in and want to cleverly twist and 
stretch the writing so that it rhymes with it; this then goes 
in like a sweet poison. That is why we see now, because 
the devil has once gained space, that he always 
introduces one heresy and one mob over the other, 
today attacking this article, tomorrow another; as he is 
already now on the way, by his advances, 1) by which 
he wants to contest Christ's divinity, item, the 
resurrection of the dead, again 2c. These are now such 
attempts, so that he attacks the whole of Christianity. 

33. above this he also attacks each one specially, first 
with the high spiritual temptations of faith 2c., and above 
the high article of Christ; there he can pretend all kinds 
of thoughts, so that he will take away or reverse the word 
from you, and put Christ out of your sight, so that you will 
look at yourself, what you have done or not done 2c. For 
he shall paint and model himself to thee as if he were 
Christ himself in majesty, and shall terrify thee as a judge 
demanding thy works of thee 2c., yea, even deceiving 
thine own thoughts of Christ and faith, that thou mayest 
think thyself right in them, and yet nothing.

should be read. The word "Anlaufe" is found there often in the form: 
"Anleufft", as in the following lines.

W. IX, 451-454. 829 





is then your conceit or devotion. If you follow such 
things, and cannot defend yourself with God's word, and 
let yourself be lured out of your defense, so that you 
dispute with him, he finally drives you in, and makes you 
so mad that you do not know where Christ or his word 
and your faith remain. But few people know about this, 
who fight and struggle with him. The other rough crowd 
never comes to it, whom the devil rides with certainty 
that they do not respect God's word, or let themselves 
think that they can do it all too well. 

For this reason it is necessary that each one of us be 
careful and diligent, and look around everywhere, and 
know that the devil is not far from us, but is always 
around us, lurking to catch us, lest he give us his 
thoughts or appearances for the word of God. We have 
established the articles of our faith sufficiently in 
Scripture, so stop there, and do not let it be twisted with 
glosses and interpreted according to reason, as it 
rhymes or not 2c., but if anyone tries to smear something 
else on you from your reason and your thoughts, then 
say, "Here | have the dry word of God and my faith, and 
| will stay with it; | will not think any further, ask any more 
questions, or listen any more, nor puzzle out how this or 
that rhymes, nor listen to you, even if you bring in a 
different text or saying than is contrary to what you have 
drawn from your head and smeared your slobber on it. 
For the Scripture shall not be contrary to itself, nor to 
some articles of faith, though it be contrary in thy mind, 
and rhyme not. But enough of this has often been said 
elsewhere. 


V. 12. For we do not have flesh and blood to 
contend with. 


35 Here he goes on to describe the enemy under 
which we lie here, and makes it truly terrible enough, so 
that we do not throw it to the wind so safely and freely, 
but know what kind of a fight we have to endure and 
what kind of a journey we have to wait for. For it is 
necessary for anyone who is to fight and contend, and 
who intends to win, to know beforehand what kind of 
enemy he has against him, what his attacks are, and 
how strong and powerful he is, and what worries and 
dangers he has to face. 





(36) Now that he says, "We do not have to contend 
with flesh and blood," these words "flesh and blood" 
must not be understood here to mean the evil lusts or 
provocations of the flesh, as to fornication, anger, 
hatred, pride, avarice, etc., as if one should not contend 
against them, as if one should not argue against them, 
but "flesh and blood" is what St. Paul calls, according to 
his way, the state and nature of the world, or of the 
people on earth, who live in the flesh and blood 
(although the latter is finely and nobly ordered, and God 
wants to keep it), because it is not spirit, or the business 
and work of the Holy Spirit. Just as he also speaks in 
Gal. 1, 16, when he says of the apostles: When | came 
up to Jerusalem, "I did not discuss it with flesh and 
blood," 2c., that is, | did not inquire what kind of people 
they were, like great apostles, or the same disciples. So 
that in this place it is not called something evil in man, 
but something separate, and distinguished between our 
army and wars and the world. In the world nothing but 
flesh and blood wars against one another, one prince, 
city, nation against another; but all this is none of our 
business. For it is not a thing of the Holy Spirit, preached 
from heaven, or revealed and given, but first established 
with the creation, Genesis 1:28, when we became flesh 
and blood, and God gave authority to man over all 
creatures, confirming that they should walk in his nature. 
There is no need of the Holy Spirit, but what is ordered 
according to reason and the order of men, let it remain 
so that every man may have and protect his house, yard, 
wife, child and servants; which also the heathen and the 
ungodly have, who persecute the gospel, and know not 
of any spirit. 

(37) And herewith he teaches us that we Christians 
should not accept such warfare, which the world wages 
and drives, anywhere, and not do as our devilish 
prophets, coining men and fine rascals did, who wanted 
to attack the regiment and fight with the sword, and 
exterminate the wicked, which belongs to flesh and 
blood among themselves, that is, to human power, 
forces and wisdom, dominion and rule on earth. But we 
are to be armed against other enemies than earthly 
ones, who fight with us for another life, 


830 Erl. (S.) 18, Z41-L43. Interpretation on the epistle to the Ephesians. W. IX, 454-456. 


Kingdom, country and dominion, since 1) it applies 
eternally life or death, heavenly kingdom or hellish fire. 
There is something more to it than what flesh and blood 
is and is able to do; for the same only affects vain 
temporal and transient good and being, but to us it is 
eternally good or harm. Therefore we do not have such 
an enemy, whom we can kill and strangle, as is done in 
the world, because he is a spirit that does not have flesh 
and blood; so we are also not flesh and blood, as far as 
we are Christians, although we are flesh and blood for 
the body and this life. 

038 But sayest thou, Must we fight against our herds, 
and against our rebels, and against our heretics, which 
are flesh and blood? But we do not fight against them as 
against flesh and blood, but against the wicked devil, 
who fights against us through them, and attacks us not 
in a fleshly or bodily way, but our faith, the dear Word, 
baptism, sacrament, and all the articles of faith; which 
neither flesh and blood gave, nor instituted, nor belongs 
to this earthly regime, but is begotten from heaven, 2) 
and belongs to eternal life. Therefore we do not fight 
against them to take away their body, goods or anything 
else, or to save what is ours against them; but to keep 
our doctrine and faith, Christ and God, and for this 
purpose to strike them off the devil and win them, and to 
conquer eternal life; of which the world knows nothing. 

39. With these words he shows what our state is, and 
how it is done for us, namely, that we must stand here in 
battle, and a Christian who wants to believe must 
prepare himself, that he must fight and struggle, if not 
outwardly with mobs and false tongues, but inwardly in 
his heart against unbelief, false thoughts and giving in, 
and wait all hours for punishment, both from others and 
from himself, so that the devil may strike his heart, make 
him afraid, grieved and despairing; there is no other way 
out. For this spirit cannot celebrate, he is God's enemy 
and the enemy of eternal life; therefore he also thinks to 
strike you away, and wants to have everyone dead. 


1) Thus the Erlangen. Wittenberg and Jena: that.

831 


Do not seek our money or any other corruptible thing, but 
how he may deprive us of eternal life. If he has this, he 
has taken all things, and they are his own. But if he take 
the word, which bringeth eternal life, he hath taken it. 

Now it is a yearly trade, and it is terrible that one 
would be afraid to wait for it without interruption, that it is 
not a matter of losing the shabby neck, but the one, 
irretrievable treasure, namely, eternally lived or died. 
This good is so great that no man's heart can 
comprehend it (therefore a great, hard struggle is also 
necessary for it, and is nevertheless quite easily done, if 
one does not hold to the dear word with all one's 
strength, so that one loses it eternally), and is not to be 
held in such low esteem, as the world does, and some 
unintelligent spirits pretend, deceived by the devil, about 
the sacrament, or other error: one should not argue 
about one article so hard 2c., and over it break up 
Christian love, nor give one another over it to the devil; 
but, though one be mistaken in one little thing, as 
otherwise one is in others, let one give way and let go a 
little, and yet keep brotherly and Christian unity or 
fellowship. No, dear man, not to me of peace and unity, 
about which one loses God's word; for with that already 
eternal life and everything would be lost. It is not a matter 
of giving way, nor of conceding anything, to you or to 
some man for love, but to the word all things shall give 
way, whether it be enemy or friend. For it is not given for 
the sake of outward or worldly unity and peace, but for 
the sake of eternal life. The word and the doctrine are to 
make Christian unity or fellowship; where the one is 
equal and united, the other will well follow; where not, 
there remains no unity. Therefore tell me of no love nor 
friendship where one wants to break off from the word or 
faith; for it is not called love, but the word brings eternal 
life, God's grace and all heavenly treasures. 

(41) This we will gladly do, that we may keep outward 
peace with them, as we must do in the world with 
everyone, even with the worst of enemies; let it go its 
way. 


832 Erl. (s.) 18, p43-S4S. Sermon on Eph. 6, 10-17. 


But for the sake of doctrine and Christian fellowship, we 
do not want to have anything to do with them, nor do we 
consider them brothers, but enemies, because they 
knowingly persist in their error and fight against them 
through our spiritual struggle. Therefore it is only a 
devilish and deceitful, cunning attempt, which pretends 
such things, and demands that one should give way a 
little, and hold an error to be true, for the sake of unity, 
so that he seeks to lead us thus cunningly from the word. 
For if we accept such a thing and become one, he has 
already gained space, and soon he has taken a whole 
cubit when a finger's breadth would have given way to 
him, and so soon he has even torn it down. 

(42) It does not seem that there is such a great fate 
and power in it, but St. Paul makes it truly great, that it 
does not count for money, nor goods, nor the love and 
favor of men, nor worldly peace and comfort, nor what 
flesh and blood is and is able to give and take, nor what 
the world can give and take, but the loss of God and 
eternal life. Therefore let that remain or go where it 
remains or goes, for he has not yet gained anything by 
it. But if you understand that he takes away this part, 
namely the word, then you have lost everything, and 
there is no more help or advice. For the main thing is 
gone, without which no good life, nor what you are able 
to do, is still valid before God, and yet the devil stands 
after it with such beautiful pretenses and appearances, 
and seeks how he may take it from you; for he has it in 
mind that he wants to take it all from you. Therefore, do 
not joke nor be sure. 

(43) If thou shouldst fight for thy house, and for thy 
court, and for thy wife, and for thy child, and at last for 
thy own life and limb, thou wouldst not be slothful, but 
wouldst seek thine enemy, and not leave him peace, nor 
accept from him, nor yield to him, but see how thou canst 
get the better of him, and become his mighty. Now you 
have other enemies here, who mean you differently, and 
have sworn eternal death to you, and do not stop until 
they are able to overpower you, and yet attack you with 
such cunning, as said above [§27 ff], as if they were 
seeking love.

"W. IX, 486459. 833 


and friendship to you 2c. Behold, this is the reason why 
St. Paul so highly exhorts us to be strong in the Lord and 
in his mighty strength, that is, not to be moved to depart 
a hair's breadth from the word, but to confidently resist 
such crafty attempts of the devil. 


But with princes and mighty men, namely with the 
lords of the world, who rule in the darkness of this 
world. 


44 Then you see what kind of man a Christian is, and 
what kind of enemies he has with whom he fights, that 
they are called princes and mighty lords. This is a very 
unequal thing: a single, poor, miserable man (as we 
Christians are), despised in the world and forsaken by 
everyone, to sit and stand alone and fight against 
princes and lords, who are not only mighty, but also very 
many. For because he calls them princes and lords, they 
must fight not alone, nor 2) singly, but with a great 
people and army, and certainly stronger than any prince 
on earth can do. 

(45) This would still frighten someone who would 
become a Christian and go into battle if such a 
newspaper were announced to him, saying: "If you want 
to be baptized and be in the fellowship of the sacrament, 
the gospel and the Lord Christ in Christendom, then 
prepare yourself to go to the front and lie in battle, not 
against an enemy like yourself, but against many princes 
and mighty men with a great and powerful army. How 
could you be safe and of good cheer if, as a single man, 
you had as your enemy a mighty sovereign, who armed 
himself against you with all seriousness and power? And 
we go along as safely and without worry as the good 
fellows, and so carelessly throw it to the wind, as if the 
devil were a faint, dull fly, or had died long ago, and as 
if it were a bad, little thing at all for the Christians’ fight; 
as the sophists think with their dream doctrine, and 
slobber that a little drop of grace is enough to earn 
eternal life, and faith is nothing but a dormant, idle thing, 
in the

835 





Sitting in the heart 2c. Just as the other spirits of the mob 
dream, who care nothing for the high chief article of 
Christ, how they do the same, and fence with it against 
the devil, meanwhile they have to cause heartache with 
their own deeds 2c. 

46 Now notice here how the Scriptures paint and 
describe the devil, so that you may know him, what kind 
of power, authority, dominion and rule he 1) has. For 
Christ also calls him a "prince of the world," and shows 
that he also has a kingdom (as kings and emperors have 
on earth); which is done in such a way that the supreme 
rule, as Roman emperor, has under him other lords and 
members or estates, through which he spreads out and 
leads his regiment, so that it is all orderly, and goes as it 
should go in the regiment, emperor over princes, princes 
over counts, knights, nobles, and these over peasants 
and citizens 2c. For where there is no such order, there 
is no empire nor regiment, but a wild, desolate mixture, 
since everything runs among each other without 
distinction, like cows in the pasture or wild animals in the 
forest. So the devil, as a mighty lord, also has an empire 
and regiment, and under him great, powerful princes and 
potentates (as he calls them here), and each of them 
under him his bunch of devils, as his court servants and 
army. Just as the holy angels have a regiment among 
themselves, since some of them are called archangels 
and great princes, and have a large number of heavenly 
hosts with them, as Luc. 2, 13. 2) is written, and the 
Scriptures show elsewhere that they also fight with their 
host against the devils. Therefore, there must be an 
innumerable multitude, for he has a far, great regiment 
and dominion, namely over the whole world; therefore he 
must have many servants and people, through whom he 
orders and directs his regiment everywhere. 

(47) Now what his rule is, the Scriptures show in many 
places, and Paul himself in the following words; and it is 
well to be seen, looking at the world, namely, that he is

2) Here also the second edition of the Erlanger has reprinted 
Walch's wrong citation, "Luc. 2, 3.". 
3) Jenaer: the. 





He is a liar and a murderer, Joh. 8, 44, and does nothing 
else, but takes the souls of God, and eternally corrupts 
them, destroys Christ's kingdom together with his gospel, 
and fills hell without ceasing; in addition, he corrupts this 
temporal being and regime, which God has ordered and 
established on earth, so that no good nor peace remains: 
this he does without ceasing with all seriousness and 
power, through himself and his spirits everywhere. For 
he is a busy, restless spirit, who cannot celebrate nor be 
satisfied with lies and murder, and does the same with 
such power that God must be there with all his angels 
and his kingdom's power and might to defend and control 
him. This means that the enemy is painted terribly 
enough. 

(48) But he makes it still more terrible with the 
following words: First, that he calls them "lords of the 


world," in Greek yoouoxpdtopal, not, as we call our 
princes, world princes or worldly lords, but such lords as 
are mighty in the world and have the whole world under 
them; and calls not one, but many of them, each of which 
is mightier and stronger than all the emperors and kings 
of the earth. And not only this, but these same emperors 
and kings with their power have under them. This is a 
great and powerful title, conceived in a single word. Thus 
no prince or lord can be called on earth, even though the 
Roman or Turkish emperor had ten times as many titles. 
For he is not called a king of France or Hispania, nor over 
three or four kingdoms, which none of the world is, nor 
can become, powerful, yes, not even of his own country, 
where God does not exist; but his kingdom or 
emperorship extends as far as the world is: there he is a 
lord, has all things mightily under him, and is his all that 
does not believe in Christ, and in addition earth, water 
and air, as will follow, so that against him the Turkish 
emperor together with all the lords in the world are to be 
counted as beggars. Indeed, St. Paul elsewhere calls 
him "a god of the world," 2 Corinthians 4:4, as he also 
has hearts in his power and drives them to do what he 
wills. 

But here he names all his courtiers, who rule with him 
and serve him, as his princes, councillors and estates of 
the kingdom 2c. that he needs for his regiment,

According to which each one is skilful and achieves 
much. For they are not all alike among themselves, 
though they be all mighty and strong spirits, but one is 
more cunning and crafty than another. Just as in the 
world a bad man comes to great power and rule because 
of his skill, whether he is of lowly blood or birth. He also 
knows how to order it in every place, and how to attack 
any one, where he should send foolish or clever devils. 
For he has had great experience and tried many things, 
as he has ruled in the world for so long, persecuting and 
afflicting Christendom, and sees well what we are and 
are able to do. 

50. Now we are also here on earth in the middle of 
his country or empire, and lie in his own court for lodging, 
since he has ordered fine court servants everywhere 
against us, and sends here a bunch of devils, there also 
a bunch, here a prince devil, there a noble devil, who are 
all mighty lords; and we poor, miserable people shall lie 
in our enemy's dominion and inn as in a murderer's pit, 
and fight against him from his own castle, who otherwise 
cannot resist an angry prince or squire. Nor must we 
here submit and boast that we do not fight with a great, 
mighty king on earth, but with the infernal emperor, as if 
those earthly lords were far too small for us to lay 
ourselves against them; but because we are God's 
warriors, we must have other, greater lords against us, 
and so fight with them that we strike them down, and 
retain the victory, not only against a single one, but 
against all his princes and whole army, that they shall 
not be able to do anything against us. 

51 This is now unbelievable and ridiculous. Just as if 
| were to stand up and boast that | wanted to defeat the 
Turkish emperor alone, all the world would laugh at me 
as a foolish man, especially if | had not been armed 
differently, as one can see now; it must still have been 
held here and attacked, and thus decided that we will 
certainly retain the victory. But this battle and victory are 
much different, 





than in the worldly war. For here | must thus war with the 
devil, the Turks, and all the world that is against me, that 
| set both head and stocking, neck and belly (which the 
world does not call conquered, but lost and corrupted), 
and let go of everything | have here, alone, that | may 
keep the word, and thereby gain eternal life and eternal 
victory, so that here is no army, armor or weapons, no 
power nor strength in ourselves, but only weakness, and 
loss of all worldly, temporal things, without the eternal 
word, which is a spiritual; eternal power of God, and our 
all-embracing armor. 

52 See, St. Paul also wants to praise our knighthood 
and the great power of our Lord Christ. Paul also hereby 
praises our knighthood, and the mighty power of our 
Lord Christ, that through the word he has so great a 
victory: Not against the beggars, Turkish or other lords 
and kings, who in a moment are dead and to be 
strangled, but against one who is called an emperor or 
prince of the world, above in the air, who has vain 
princes under him, that he may go forth to battle; and yet 
in the midst of them he gathers and builds his church or 
Christianity, as a castle founded on a strong rock, which 
is not called, In spite of Caesar! but: So strong and firm 
that the gates of hell shall not break down nor be able to 
prevail against it; and yet by nothing else, but by fighting 
for the dear word in which we have promised eternal life, 
and have already begun the victory, that we only stick to 
it, and neither take it nor let it go. For by this we have 
become Christians and warriors of God, fighting not for 
the good of the world, but for heaven. 

(53) To this end we must now direct ourselves, so 
that we may confidently strike out among the enemy, 
and not become slothful or snoring. For the enemy 
neither feasts nor lacks us, as we well see and 
experience daily; lest we lose God's word by our 
security, or be dissuaded with guile. For where he wins 
the castle, he has taken it all, and eternal life with it. For 
by this he does the greatest harm, that by his lies and 
mischievousness he leads hearts away from the word, 
and brings a great multitude from eternal life; otherwise 
he could not do so much harm by murder and outright 
violence.

54. But even though he is such a mighty lord, and has 
so many cunning, evil spirits, that he is equipped to 
defend on all sides, and attacks us at every turn, we still 
have the advantage that our Lord is also mighty, wise 
and prudent enough, and has also often countered and 
defeated him, and knows how to attack him and put him 
down through his weak Christians, so that we have no 
other defense than his word, which he gives us in his 
mouth; And also in all places appointed against him by 
his ministers and preachers. This is beyond all his power 
and wisdom, so that even through a child born today, 
who was brought into Christianity through the Word and 
called to his army, he can defeat and overcome the devil 
for ten or twenty years. As he proved in the past through 
his martyrs, also young virgins and maidens, as St. 
Agnes and Agatha, who fought chivalrously against him 
and won, just by holding fast to the word and giving their 
life and limb over it. Therefore the Scripture gives him 


the title and name, that he is called: Dominus vir 


pugnator, the Lord is a right prince of war; and yet he 
wars with no worldly armor nor power, but by his Spirit 
with and with the word. This is our consolation, that 1) 
we may stand firm and endure; otherwise we must soon 
despair of the devil's power, and confess ourselves lost. 


Who rule in the darkness of this world. 


55 Then thou shalt hear where and how they reign, 
and why he calleth them lords or emperors of the world, 
that they mightily reign over all the earth. Therefore you 
must not be sure, nor think that the devil with his angels 
is far away in India or in Moorland, but know that he is 
not far away from you, yes, daily and every moment with 
you and around you, in your closet, around your bed, 
over the table, in the street, where you are, walk, stand, 
and what you do 2c. But they reign (he says) "in 
darkness." Not only because the devil rules in the hearts 
of men in such a way that he is not seen, but also 


because where he rules there is darkness, 
1) Jenaer: "that". 





839 


that is, no Knowledge of God or his word. For where the 
Word of God is not pure, there are hardened and blinded 
hearts that know nothing of God and Christ, as St. Paul 
says elsewhere, 2 Cor. 4:3, 4: "If our gospel is hidden or 
covered, it is hidden in those who are lost, in whom the 
god of this world blinds the minds of unbelievers, so that 
they do not see the bright light of the gospel, the clarity 
of Christ." 

(56) Through such darkness he holds the whole 
world and maintains his rule, so that no knowledge of 
God and his will shines into its heart; and through such 
hearts he speaks and works, and instigates all kinds of 
error, false doctrine and heresy, discord and strife in the 
faith, as well as hatred and envy, war and rebellion 
among men; so that in short his rule is nothing else, but 
both vain lies and murder. That is why St. Paul and 
Christ Himself used to call the world a "kingdom of 
darkness", or "children of darkness", and its nature 
"works and dominion of darkness", because it does not 
know God's word, 2) nor wants to hear it, and does not 
even see how it is under the devil's power and rule. That 
is to say, a real inner darkness in the heart, which is 
without faith, which is the devil's dwelling and lodging 
place: this is what he occupies, and makes it so that one 
does not recognize God's word (even though one sees 
and hears it), nor can accept and suffer it, but despises 
and persecutes the same, and instead casts out his lies 
for truth and light, and thus holds the world captive in his 
obedience, against God and his word. 

Because he calls them "lords of the world" and says 
that they "rule" over it, he gives enough to understand 
that they have captured the hearts of men violently, that 
they must think, speak and do what he wants. And here 
no one can boast of his free will and of the light of human 
reason, as if one could serve God and do his will, but 
here it says that everything goes and remains in 
darkness, according to the will of the devil, even though 
there are many fine, wise, learned, honorable and pious 
people among them. For the devil must

have such people to his regiment, and not be all things 
hideous and black through public wickedness and 
iniquity, but also seem beautiful and handsome white, 
otherwise his regiment could not exist on earth; so he 
also desires to be beautiful, and wants only the best and 
cutest on earth and the most beautiful dwelling. 

Therefore, although some live in the world in the most 
beautiful way, have high reason and many precious gifts 
of God, to rule skillfully and to instruct other people, 2c. 
yet it is vain darkness with them, and are subject to the 
devil for his service with the same they have. As we can 
see in all the world, he has captured lords and princes, 
the wisest and most learned people, so that they must 
believe, speak and do what he wants. And though the 
word of God is preached so brightly and clearly that it 
shines in the eyes, yet they must not understand it; yea, 
though they know it, and confess without their thanks 
that it is the truth: yet they must despise it, or persecute 
it, and defend their darkness and the devil's lies, and 
afflict the Christians about it, that they may perform the 
devil's obedience and will, and make true this and the 
like text of the Scriptures. 


With the evil spirits under heaven. 


59. Then he calls the child what they are called, and 
what they are; they are not flesh and blood, but spirits, 
and such spirits as rule over the world, and reign above 
in the air, and are called by their right name, "Evil spirits"; 
that is, not only clever, shrewd, and cunning, high and 
far above men's reason and wisdom, but also 
poisonous, wicked, and bitter, that all their thoughts and 
minds stand day and night only how they do harm, both 
(as [§ 47] said) by murder and lying. For this is all their 
delight and joy, where they can only cause evil, strife and 
unhappiness, and take from us wife, child, body, life, 
health and all that we have, and ruin the world with war 
and blood among themselves; but most of all do harm 
and suffering to the pious and poor, innocent Christians. 

60. after that they are even worse and harmful 





He is more careful with their lies and seduction. For he 
is not satisfied with it, if he sees the whole world thrown 
into one another and everything swimming in blood, but 
he deals with it, how he hinders and prevents that no 
man becomes blessed nor keeps the word, but brings 
from God's kingdom to eternal death. When he does 
this, he laughs and is happy. In short, it is such 
wickedness that no man can comprehend, and it is not 
possible for a man to be so wicked by his nature. For 
when he is very 1) wicked and highly enraged, and does 
most grievously, he freshly avenges himself, and pours 
out his wrath and fury all at once, and then ceases. But 
to be so wicked that one seeks his pleasure and joy in 
making people miserable, stuck in hunger, thirst, misery 
and distress, and in addition to this, to shed blood and 
commit treacherous acts, especially against those who 
have done him no harm nor can do him any harm, that 
is actually a hellish and unsated fury and rage of the 
wicked devil, which no human nature is capable of. For 
no man of himself could be so desperately wicked as to 
take pleasure in it and tickle himself with it when he sees 
a young, innocent child stabbed to death before his eyes 
without any cause, or a whole city, both young and old, 
innocently murdered. 

61. Therefore, this must not be human malice, as is 
now seen in our tyrants and papists, who so fiercely 
persecute and hate the gospel without any cause, and 
are so bitter against us and other Christians (who, after 
all, have never done them any harm, but all good), but 
have done them all good, and would still gladly do so), 
both with ravishing, blaspheming, and plaguing and 
murdering poor people, that they cannot pour out their 
poisonous anger and hatred enough, and are so hungry 
and thirsty for innocent people's blood that they cannot 
get enough. There one sees actually the devil as bodily 
reigning in them, and they ride and drive. 

62) Likewise, we see in some of the spirits of the 
wicked, who are also possessed by the devil, that they 
despise, blaspoheme, and speak evil of no one so 
shamefully as of us, of whom they are 


1) Wittenberg and Jena: so much. 


842 Erl. (2.) 18, 854-856. Interpretation on the epist 
yet have all that is good, freedom and security. These 
are the vain works and fruits of the infernal regiment, 
which so embittered the hearts with its malice against the 
gospel and word of God. For he is sorry that a man on 
earth still believes and comes to God, even that a God 
and Christ lives and reigns; and that the stars, sun and 
moon still shine; and of course, if he could, he would 
gladly throw everything into one heap at a moment's 
notice; he has also set it to destroy God's kingdom and 
what he has made, as much as there is in it, even if he 
himself has to go to ruins over it. 

Now you see why he said, "We do not have to fight 
with flesh and blood. For if we had to do with men alone 
(whether they were emperors, kings, and princes), we 
would soon overcome them with our gospel, and in one 
year convert the whole world, because it is such a bright 
and irrefutable truth, and no one would be so wicked as 
to set himself against the known truth and such a 
wholesome doctrine, which brings and brings all good 
and happiness to everyone, and does no harm or harm 
to anyone; but all the world would have to say: Well, this 
is the right truth, and a fine and delicious doctrine; as we 
see that many of our enemies must confess it, decided 
by the truth, which is so strong in itself that no one can 
oppose it, and men's minds must soon be taken captive. 

(64) But here the devil himself reigns, and stifles 
reason, so that it shall not see nor accept it, though it be 
driven in and overcome, but rather emboldens the heart, 
so that it shall be contrary even to the known truth, and 
shall set itself against it. Just as the Jewish saints and 
scribes knowingly blasphemed Christ and his manifest 
signs and wonders and gave them to the devil. For this 
purpose the devil is able to devise and introduce such 
shrewd plots and swift measures, poisonous practices 
against the gospel, that it is beyond measure; as we 
have often and much seen and experienced in our 
enemies, that one must wonder and grasp that it is the 
devil's rule, and that no man's understanding could do 
such things. Therefore St. Pau 





e to the Ephesians. W. IX, 469-472. 843 


lus so diligently warned here and painted the enemy that 
we know we are not dealing with men of reason, whom 
we would soon like to win over, but with one who is an 
evil, mischievous enemy, and in one finger wiser and 
more cunning than the whole world. 

He also expresses where they dwell and have their 
being, when he says: "With the evil spirits under 
heaven", that is, up in the air, there they hover, like the 
clouds above us, fluttering and flying everywhere 
around us like bumblebees, with a large, innumerable 
cluster, also often let themselves be captured with bodily 
form, like the flames in the sky, in dragon form or other 
figures. Item, in forests and by the water, where they are 
seen leaping like bucks, or puffing like mops, 1) creeping 
into swamps and ponds, so that they drown people and 
break their necks, and are gladly in desolate places and 
corners, as in desolate houses 2c., so that they have the 
air and everything that is around and above us, as far as 
the sky is, in their possession; there they sit and look 
and lie in wait for us, as they can only do us harm. 

For they are not yet cast into hell and damnation, as 
St. Peter says, but are only bound with chains to enter 
it; that is, they have their judgment, which has already 
been decided, and the judgment has come upon them, 
that is, their chains and bonds. That is why they rage 
against us, because they know that they will lose their 
castle and beautiful dwelling and will have to leave us, 
that we will be exalted from this weak, earthly life to 
eternal glory at the last day, and will have the air and the 
whole heaven in their place, and they will be cast into 
the abyss to eternal torment. Therefore they fight with 
us, whether they want to bring us with them from God's 
face and promised glory. 

Now all this applies especially to us who cling to 
Christ, that we must stand here and forever, as under 
vain guns and spears, since 2) they all aim at us and 
rush at us from all sides with all their force, 


1) i.e. burn like the boggarts. 
2) Jenaer: that.

Cunning and wickedness, how they want to become 
powerful. For what is of the world, unbelievers, 
despisers of God, thieves and scoundrels, there are not 
many devils among them, for they are such that one 
devil could lead away ten thousand wicked peasants 
and squires. But against us, who have renounced them, 
marked by baptism, and separated from them by the 
gospel, and set against them, there go not one, but a 
thousand against one; and though these are too few and 
small, they strengthen themselves, and take to 
themselves many more and worse, needing moreover 
their subjects, the ungodly and wicked world, also for 
this. 

68 Here we must see how God shows His almighty 
power, according to His creation, to preserve us against 
the fierce wrath of the devil, so that he does not have to 
do or create what he wants, even though he is so 
powerful, and we are like a dull fly against him. Fly 
against an angry bear or lion: nor does he give him 
power to take away our lives and all God's goods, which 
otherwise he would not let us have for a moment; unless 
God lets it happen for terror and an example. As when 
he breaks a man's neck, hangs or drowns him, and kills 
not only men but also cattle, and what more harm is 
done in the world, the air is poisoned, grain and fruit in 
the fields are spoiled by weather and hail, and all kinds 
of plague and pestilence reign; all this is his work and 
business. But all this is not yet as he would like; for 
where he now strangles or murders one, he would rather 
strangle ten thousand. So that one nevertheless sees 
what power he has, and learns to fear God and pray that 
he will protect us through his power and the service of 
the dear angels and protect us from their violence and 
malice. This is what he does in the worldly realm, but he 
must resist it much more strongly in the spiritual realm, 
since it also does much more harm, holds the whole 
world captive in error and unbelief, and daily brings up 
new lies and false teachings. However, God sustains us 
through His Spirit and Word, and sets us against His 
mighty kingdom and dominion, so that it must finally be 
destroyed. 

; ‘ 13. For this reason, take hold of the armor of 
od. 


(69) Hitherto he has painted the devil with his proper 
color; not as the painters paint him, black and hideous, 
with sharp claws and teeth and fiery eyes, 2c., but as he 
attacks the Christians, especially with his cunning 
approach and spiritual roguishness, since he can adorn 
himself above all wisdom, and in addition with our own 
gospel, and pretends to be a brother, or Christ himself. 
Since you know these things, that you have such an 
enemy against you, and should and must be in constant 
battle with him, and yet are so weak against him 
because of your own strength and wisdom, see to it that 
you are not left alone, nor rely on it, as if you had God's 
word and faith, and now be sure that he will not attack 
and overthrow you unprotected, but think, and take up 
the right armor, not the straw armor of your reason. For 
if you should fight with him, and be no better armed than 
with your wisdom and strength, he will soon blow you 
away as the wind blows away a tree leaf. Therefore you 
must be differently armed, that he may see, not human 
armor and weapons, but "God's armor," which he has 
not seen before; which is not our strength, but God's 
strength and mighty power; as he said above, v. 11. 

70 For | have said that with these words he 
distinguishes the bodily and spiritual armor or weapons. 
Physical armor belongs to this regiment on earth, 
princes and lords, to lead against evil men and enemies; 
this does not concern us. For we must not fight for gold 
or silver, or for land and people, castles and cities, or for 
temporal peace and outward righteousness, that each 
may keep what is his. For this purpose other people are 
appointed, lawyers, and whatever persons and offices 
belong to them, who know what is right and how they 
should preserve it. But we Christians are different 
people, and stand in a different battle, since we fight for 
another life, land, property, treasure and kingdom, which 
shall last forever; so we also have such enemies, whom 
we could not beat away with iron or steel, sword or guns, 
or execute, therefore we must also be armed with other 
armor, i.e., with other weapons.

847 





The first one is the one that has been begotten and given 
from heaven by God Himself. 


That you may withstand in the evil day, and stand 
firm in all your doings. 


He calls the time an evil day, because here we have 
to fight with the devil, who is so hard on us and does not 
let us rest, so that he takes away our eternal, heavenly 
treasure. For he speaks here even of the spiritual regime, 
which concerns that life, which is the real main battle, as 
enough has been said, so that the worldly one also gets 
involved in it. For this is why he also attacks this life with 
plagues, murders, blood, 2c., so that he takes away our’ 
word and brings us from eternal life. These are the days 
of battle, when we have nothing but eternal warfare 
against this enemy, from every side, since he sends 
troops among us everywhere, and attacks us with his lies, 
both inwardly and outwardly, as with his right harmful 
weapons, just as he does in that regiment with sword and 
tyranny; then we must stand and defend ourselves 
against both. 

But our weapons and armor are much stronger, for 
they are called "God's armor," who wants to strike him 
through us, and thus show his great strength and power 
through this poor, weak flesh and blood, which he 
previously broke and trampled under his feet: to him he 
wants to put on his armor, and overthrow the emperor and 
ruler above all rulers from his throne and regiment, and 
through them preserve what he has given us, his name 
and kingdom, gospel, baptism, sacrament 2c. Only that 
we take care and stand firm, and defend ourselves with 
it, and not be found without the armor, nor let ourselves 
be chased out, that is, out of the gospel, faith and our 
profession, so that it does not happen to us as it did before 
under the papacy, when none remained, and the devil 
took over and won everything, with terrible damage t 
Christendom. And how now our red spirits, and those wh 
follow them, have lost both their armor and everything 
and have instead put on the armor of the Strah, their ow 
conceit.

with § 38: "begotten from heaven". 





and dreams, and be chased and driven by every wind of 
doctrine, from one error to another. 


V. 14. Stand therefore, girding up your loins with 
truth. 


He now begins to name our armor and weapons, and 
shows how we are to arm ourselves and send ourselves, 
so that we may be protected in all places, so that we may 
be able to resist the devil wherever he attacks us; and he 
sets six kinds of armor, but it is all in the Pauline manner, 
and not well spoken in German. First, let the loins be 
girded with truth, that is, that they lead a righteous life, 
that there be no hypocrisy but earnestness. For "truth" is 
called in the Scriptures righteousness, which is not false, 
nor lying. Therefore he says: "First of all, see to it that you 
are righteous Christians for your own part, and that you 
take the word and the faith seriously. For whoever wants 
to be in Christianity, and does not take up the cause with 
earnestness, but only lets himself be counted among the 
crowd, wants to enjoy, and yet does not want to fight, he 
will soon be given to the devil; for he is not "girded up," 
that is, unlaced, and armed with truth and _ right 
earnestness, as a man of war should be. 

74 For to gird up one's loins is what we say in the 
Scriptures, to gird up and make ready, that one may be 
ready and able to run or to fight, that nothing may hinder 
him when he is about to strike or to spring from the 
enemy. Just as in German it is customary to say: You 
should lift yourself up high, so that you can escape from 
a mischievous man. Thus Christ says to his disciples, 
Luc. 12, 35: "Let your loins be girded, and your lights be 
burning", that is, be always prepared and ready, as 
servants waiting for their master, to go out to meet him 
when he comes home at night. Item 2 Kings 4:29, the 
prophet Elisha said to his servant, "Gird up your loins and 
take my staff"; that is, gird yourself up and set out: so that 
by this speech it is indicated that whoever is in a position 
where he has something to do, to run and to do, that he 
should prepare himself for it as if he were in earnest and 
wanted to attack it.

W. IX, 477-480. 





(75) Therefore the first thing that belongs to this fight 
is that we be girded and girded, that is, that we think that 
it must be fought and contested, and surrender and send 
ourselves to it with earnestness, and do it righteously. 
For the other, false Christians, who do not take it 
seriously and truthfully, go along safely and without 
worry, and seek good days, or their own honor and 
enjoyment, as if they should not fight, they do murderous 
harm to Christianity; as the devil always includes those 
who may well carry the appearance and name, but there 
is neither heart nor seriousness, through whom he does 
more harm than otherwise through those who are 
outside of us; as St. Paul complains everywhere about 
such false Christians and false workers. So the devil 
also attacks us through our flesh, whether we are 
righteous, that we become lazy and slothful, and do not 
take and do our work as earnestly as we ought. 
Therefore we must be prepared and fight against this, 1) 
and always arouse and stop ourselves, so that we do 
not also fall into such sloth and security, and finally into 
vain hypocrisy. 


And dressed with the cancer of justice. 


76. if the first thing is that the Christian state is without 
hypocrisy, then this must also follow, that one should 
keep the breast "with the cancer of righteousness"; 
which is a good conscience, that a Christian may so live 
that he offend no man, and that no man may complain 
of him, as the apostle Paul everywhere boasts, as, 2 
Cor. 1, 12. he says, "Our glory is this, namely, the 
testimony of our conscience, which we have walked in 
simplicity and godly integrity 2c. in the world." And also 
Moses and the prophets defy anyone, that they have not 
taken a donkey, nor anything else, nor been too near, 
nor done any harm. This is called the "cancer of 
righteousness," an innocent, righteous life and outward 
conduct toward all men, that no one should do harm or 
hurt, but should be diligent to serve everyone and to do 
good, so that no one should accuse our consciences, 
nor the devil, nor the angels. 


1) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "we must also fence against this. 





We cannot accuse ourselves, nor move up, that we have 
not lived rightly. 

For where there is no defiance, and a man lives so 
crudely and wickedly as the great multitude in the world, 
the devil has soon won against him that he cannot stand, 
and gives him a blow before the breast, that his heart 
and courage fail him, and his conscience is frightened 
and despondent. This hinders and weakens very much, 
when a person has to stand against his own heart and 
conscience at the same time and fight with the devil, who 
also challenges righteous life and work and would like to 
turn them into sins. 

For this reason the apostles everywhere exhort 
believers to lead a life that is blameless in the sight of 
the world and everyone. This should serve to make our 
hearts all the more joyful, and to hold on to the faith all 
the more firmly and strongly, and to become certain of 
it; as St. Peter 2 Ep. 1, 10 says of it: "Dear brethren, be 
all the more diligent to make your profession and 
election firm. 2c. For by living outwardly godly in the 
sight of the world, and boasting and defying all men, | 
am made sure of my faith, as by the right good fruits of 
a good tree, and so increase that it may become firm 
and strong. Which cannot be done by those who openly 
walk in sin and evil living, for the same hinders and 
weakens, yes, hinders faith, so that his heart cannot 
grasp that certain comforting confidence that he has a 
gracious God and that his sins are forgiven him, 
because he is still in them and will not let go. Hence also 
St. John, 1 Ep. 4, 17, when he exhorts to love: 
"Therefore love is complete in us, that we may have joy 
in the day of judgment." As if to say: This is a righteous, 
perfect love, which can defiantly boast of this, even 
before God's judgment, against the devil and the world, 
that it has done good to everyone, and has proven itself, 
so that all the world must bear witness to it, and no one 
has to complain against it, so that the heart does not 
despair before God's judgment, nor must its faith sink for 
the sake of its evil life 2c. 


V.15. And booted on feet with the gospel of peace, 
that ye might be ready. 


850 Er. (L.) 18, L6L-S64. Interpretation on the epistle to the Ephesians. W. IX, 480-482. 


851 





(79) This is the third thing, that a Christian should not 
only be pious, do good, and not turn away from the way 
the world lives and does, but also have peace toward 
everyone (as he also says in Romans 12:18). both for 
ourselves and toward others, with help, counsel, and 
encouragement through the gospel, so that we can walk 
in readiness and skill, and get through the evil world 
unhindered, even though the world causes strife, strife, 
and quarrels among one another, and people's malice 
also provokes us to anger, impatience, and revenge 2c. 
Summa, it is said: If you want to be a Christian and live 
rightly in the world, send yourself to patience. 

80 For where one takes the gospel seriously and 
wants to live rightly, the cross will not remain outside; as 
all Scripture everywhere testifies, that one must wait for 
all kinds of opposition, violence, wickedness, contempt, 
ingratitude, scorn and shame, even though we do all 
good to everyone. But if thou wilt avenge thyself, and 
suffer no wrong, peace shall never come of it, and hinder 
thyself, that thou canst not advance with thy gospel, nor 
make any fruitful thing. Therefore we must be so skillful 
that we can suffer the wicked, and bear and endure 
those with whom and by whom we live, and so break 


and on our conscience drives God's judgment, and 
accuses it in such a way that everything cannot apply nor 
help, even though we have stood well before the world, 
acted faithfully with everyone and lived peacefully. Then 
he shall turn and destroy before God what you have done 
in the best of ways, and frighten you with it, torment your 
conscience, and make you so afraid and anxious that you 
do not know how to stay, so that he chases and drives 
you into disbelief and despair, so that your apron and 
belt, crab and leg armor are destroyed; as those know 
well who have tried such things.and have experienced 
the high spiritual temptations, although there are few of 
them, and the rest of the common people neither 
understand nor care about them. 

Now it comes to pass that we must take up arms, and 
to this (he says) belongs first of all a good, strong 
"shield"; if he wants to tear into your conscience, strike 
your heart, and ruin your life, that you are too loosely 
girded, or have not been serious enough, or have not 
done to everyone at all times as you should, that you may 
present yourself to him, and reproach the shield, that he 
cannot harm you 1) or break through with his arrows. 

83 Such a "shield" is faith, as he himself interprets it, 


through patience as through a thorny path. These are |which holds to the word of Christ, and takes hold of it and

with fiery fury.

W. IX, 482-485. 





Therefore he says: "By such a shield you can 
extinguish all the fiery arrows of the evil one. This 1) he 
speaks as a well-tried man, who has often been there, 
indeed, has daily fought with the devil, and has 
experienced that nothing else holds nor exists in such 
battles when the devil attacks one; and it is not enough 
to have all kinds of belt, crab and shoe, and to have all 
things equipped and skillfully standing, if one does not 
have another, by which one catches the poisonous 
arrows and strikes them away. For they go and 
penetrate through all armor, and what is ours, yes, 
through the heart to it. 

85, And calls both the devil and his weapons by his 
right name, that he may call him an "evil one," who can 
make it so evil and poisonous, so bitterly accuse and 
blaspheme, and so plague the heart that [it] no one 
believes. And his arrows are called "fiery arrows," so that 
he burns and pierces, and so shoots into the heart that 
all our lives and good consciences should shatter before 
it like wax before the fire. Even if it is lived and done in 
the best way and with the utmost earnestness, he can 
still burn a hole through it, and make it so with his 
poisonous thoughts and suggestions that you do not 
know how or from where, that it all goes away from you, 
and you wish you had never done it, and you lose 
Scripture, baptism, sacrament and everything from your 
heart. For this purpose he drives such arrows through 
his mobs and false teachers, who lead us away from 
Christ, and want to overthrow the faith and take away 
the shield; by which he makes people astray, and puts 
such arrows into the heart that no man can quench. 

86. Therefore you must be wise here and be careful 
when he aims and shoots his arrows at your heart, so 
that he may take away your confidence and trust, so that 
you may always have the shield and set it against him, 
namely, take hold of the Lord Christ in faith 2) and say: 
God grant that my life and all my doings remain where 
they may, whether they be right and established before 
all the world; for | have earnestly and faithfully taught, 
lived and conducted my profession; but because thou 
wilt strike at my heart, that all this shall not be 


1) Wittenberger: da. 
2) Wittenberg and Erlanger: gefasset. 





and plague my conscience with it: Well then, | will let all 
this go, and seize my shield, which can cover and 
protect me along with all my life 2c. Behold, then, all his 
arrows, however poisonous and wicked, must go out 
and die before him, that they may not hurt me in any 
way. For Christ stands before me and takes care of me, 
saying, "| have given my flesh and blood to this man, | 
have given my life and holiness for him, therefore let him 
go in peace. Then he must let go, and you can defy him 
through Christ, so that he will bore a hole through your 
shield. For he has burned himself in 3) Christ, that he 
can no longer do anything against him; and thus also in 
us, who are Christ's 4) and He ours (through faith), he 
has lost all his right. Even though he aims and shoots 
with his arrows, they cannot stick, but must go out before 
him in the air and become ashes. 

(87) Behold, therefore we have always so diligently 
exhorted, that every man, above all things, may well 
receive the chief article of Christ, which we preach and 
practice always, and keep it always in his heart, and see 
that he suffer it not to be taken from him, nor to be taken 
out of his sight; that, when the devil striketh the 
conscience, it may be quickly cast up, and held before 
his face. For if he seizes you alone, without this shield, 
he has wounded you with his arrows and set your heart 
on fire, and has ruined both your life and your deeds, if 
he so desires. Therefore he alone seeks, with all his 
cunning and craftiness, how he may put this article out 
of your sight, so that he may bring you into battle with 
him apart from Christ. 5) For he knows well that he will 
wound you with his arrows, and set your heart on fire, if 
he wills it. For he knows well that he can do nothing 
against this shield; therefore also St. Peter 1 Ep. 5, 8. 9. 
admonishes: "Be sober and watch, for your adversary 
the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom 
he may devour; resist him firmly in faith" 2c. Behold, he 
shows this very shield of faith, that we cannot be secure 
from the devil, lest he choke us and devour us where we 
are

not always have Christ in their hearts and hold fast to 
Him. 


V. 17. And take the helmet of salvation. 


The "helmet of salvation" is nothing other than the 
hope and expectation of another life, which is in heaven, 
for the sake of which we believe in Christ and suffer 
everything, without which we could not bear all the blows 
that are struck at our heads and inflicted on our bodies 
and lives. For we see and feel the misery that the devil 
inflicts on us in the world, tormenting and afflicting us 
without ceasing, and judging everything against us, so 
that we must bear all the hatred, anger and rage of the 
world, and take everything upon ourselves and atone for 
it where it is evil. If we should suffer such things for the 
sake of temporal things, we would much rather be dead; 
as St. Paul 1 Cor. 15:19 says: "If in this life alone we 
hope in Christ, we are the most miserable people on 
earth. And | myself would not come to the preaching 
chair for one hour in my life, if one wanted to give me 
three kingdoms. 

(89) Therefore we must know another consolation, 
because we, both of the world and the devil, are so 
miserably afflicted, both bodily and spiritually, and so 
challenged, as if it were all lost and done and suffered in 
vain, that we can take such courage against it: If the 
world does not want us to serve it in vain, to suffer and 
fight, and to put our sour sweat and blood into it, then let 
it be; we did not begin for its sake. If they do not want to 
be friends, let them be enemies, and bite and devour 
themselves with their anger and rage. But this is our 
defiance, that we believe in Jesus Christ, who is Lord 
over 1) the world, the devil, and all things, through whom 
we must surely wait for another life, that he will deliver 
us out of all this misfortune, and put under our feet what 
now oppresses and presses us. 

90 Therefore this is also a necessary armor for the 
Christians; otherwise we could not stand it the long way 
and be overcome. 


1) Wittenberger: about all. 





the shameful, evil wickedness and willfulness which the 
devil drives through the world, so that we must 
everywhere be held up to be beaten over the head, and 
all ingratitude, contempt, scorn, shame and ridicule be 
put on as a reward for our gospel and Christian life, so 
that we may serve everyone. 


And the sword of the spirit, which is the word of 
God. 


This is the last, but the strongest, and the right 
weapons of war, by which we must strike the devil and 
win. For it is not enough (as | said above) to have a good 
guard against the enemy, and to be able to put ourselves 
in front of him when he attacks us, so that we will not be 
defeated, which is called a protective power; but the 
defensive power also belongs to it, so that we may 
pursue the enemy and put him to flight. So it is not 
enough here to defend ourselves against the devil with 
faith and hope, as a shield and helmet, but also "the 
sword" must twitch, and strike at him again, and thus 
press on, so that he must fall back and flee, and thus 
retain the victory in him. Such "sword" is now (he says) 
"the word of God". For it must not be physical steel and 
iron, but a spiritual sword, so that one should strike the 
devil. 

This is done primarily by preaching the word publicly 
on the preaching platform, and then by every Christian, 
whether with himself or with others, by listening, reading, 
singing, speaking, and contemplating. For it has power 
where it is preached and acted upon loudly and purely, 
where it is learned with diligence, and where it is thought 
of with earnestness, then Satan cannot yet remain a 
devil. For it reveals his lies and mischievousness, so that 
he wants to deceive people, to trust falsely, or to drive 
them into disbelief, sadness, or despair, 2c., and shows 
the Lord Christ, whom he crucified, but ran up against 
him and burned himself, to bruise his head; therefore he 
fears and flees from it. 

It does him great harm that many souls are taken 
from him, and his kingdom is weakened and destroyed, 
and neither lies nor error can arise where it is going on, 
so that if we could see it with our eyes, you should see 
many a devil beaten, and 


856 Erl. (p.) 18, ps9 f. Sermon on Eph. 6, 10-17. 


857 


W. ix, 488f. 





Here one lies down, and there one lies down, where it is 
done right and with seriousness. For though we are 
weak in our reason and strength against this spirit, yet 
we are too strong for all devils, if we are armed with 
these weapons and weapons; which means, not our, but 
God's power and strength. 

He calls it a "sword" because it shows how one must 
use the word if one wants to beat the devil, namely that 
one must practice it with preaching, listening, learning 
2c. Not to leave it under the bench or alone in books (as 
if one leaves the sword stuck in the scabbard and rusty), 
for thus it can prove no strength, nor do harm to the 
devil, but that one draws from leather, twitches and 
grasps the sword, and always strikes about with it, that 
is, through the ministry of preaching, and otherwise 
drives it with mouth and heart, so that it always remains 
finely sharp and smooth 1). 

95 Therefore, we should see to it above all things that 
we keep it pure and true, learn it with diligence and care, 
and call upon God to keep it going through right, valiant 
preachers and faithful workers. For, where these are 
not, there follows also the murderous harm, that the 
devil breaks in, and his lies instead of the truth (yet also 
under the same appearance 


1) In the old editions: "glw" (glu), i.e. glowing, shining, bright, 
polished. Cf. Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. VIII, 1776. 1798. 


and names) to the preaching chair, and makes 
everything full of redness, so that he divides and 
corrupts the church, as we have well experienced so far 
in the whole papacy, since he has ruled so completely 
that there has not been a preaching chair where he 
would have been resisted, although the Scriptures have 
been in the book, read and sung in all the churches, but 
without heart and mind at all, and let it rust as a sword 
in the scabbard; for there has been no one who would 
have twitched and sharpened it. 

Unfortunately, we are already seeing again how God 
is punishing the contempt of the Word and the 
ingratitude of the overweening spirits, who have so soon 
been overly taught that everything becomes full of sects 
and cults, so that they lose it again, and the devil rules 
both the church and the preaching chair. We should 
leave such damage and driving a joke to ourselves, to 
have the good word dear and valuable, and do it without 
interruption where we can, because we can beat and 
overcome the devil thereby, and be safe from his lies 
and seduction. For even if we could learn nothing from 
it (Since it can never be unlearned), we may always use 
it to defend ourselves in this hard, constant battle in 
which we must fight with the devil, since it is not a matter 
of life and limb, but of eternal life, or eternal death, and 
the loss of God and all his goods.

VIII. Interpretations on the first epistle to Timothy. 


D. Martin Luther's Sermon on the Main Summa of God's 
Commandment, 


on the abuse and right use of the law, from the epistle of Paul 1 Tim. 1, 3-11.*) 
Anno 1524. 


1(1) | have often and much taught and said, and still 
say, that two main parts of the Christian doctrine are 
faith and love (as also St. Paul writes and attracts 
everywhere), that | also know nothing else to preach. 
But many careless people learn to repeat these words, 
who also want to be seen and praised, as if they could 
talk about it, but in fact know nothing about it. The same 
happens to them that they fall about on something new, 
which people like to hear, and they become only useless 
talkers. This is how it was in the beginning in the time of 
the apostles, whose teaching was based on faith in God 
and love for one's neighbor, and how one should tame 
and force the flesh with its lusts; this alone they did, and 
had nothing more to teach. 

(2) But this preaching was hindered, first, by God's 
law and the Scriptures of the Old Testament, which the 
apostles themselves led and had to confess. Then also 
that it was seen that the works or deeds of their 
preaching did not follow as it should, as is also now 
lamented. Therefore the new disciples went to, wanted 
it 


1) In the editions, the whole text is printed here, but we have 
omitted the same (as Walch) because the same is repeated in the 
following interpretation. 


To make things better, and to advise things, the two 
were mixed together, works and faith. This trouble has 
hindered the pure doctrine of faith from the beginning to 
this day. If one preaches works, one overthrows faith. 
Again, if one teaches faith, one must overthrow works. 

3 It is very difficult for people to judge this, and no 
one understands it, unless the Holy Spirit writes it into 
the heart. Many holy fathers have also stumbled in this. 
For we are always confronted with the fact that we see 
in the lives of the saints how they have been outwardly 
well tamed 2) and reared, and have proved themselves 
with great, beautiful works, from which we have called 
them holy, but have not seen them according to their 
faith. And again, we see in others some infirmities and 
weaknesses, which we have in sight, but see not 
according to faith. So we have judged according to 
works, and have not perceived faith, indeed, we have 
completely missed it, and everyone has fallen into error, 
and everyone has thought it good and delicious, so that

without the apostles, who were chosen to teach it purely, 
and to give a foundation to the doctrine. What

*This sermon is attributed in the old editions to the year 1524. Probably Luther preached in the winter of 1524 to 1525 not only on 
Genesis 1 and 2, but also on the First Epistle to Timothy in continuous sermons, of which, however, only a few have been preserved (K6stlin, 
Martin Luther, Vol. |, p. 614). However, there is no print older than the year 1526, in which year our sermon was published in Wittenberg by 
Hans WeiB under the title we gave it (Dietz, Wérterbuch zu Luthers Schriften, Quellenverzeichnif,, p. I,II). In the collective editions: in the

Erlangen, vol. 51, p. 276. We give the text after the Jena, comparing the Wittenberg.

The other books are not to be found in it, so that it is no 
wonder that it has perished and died out in our time. For 
this reason, St. Paul does as much as he can to Timothy, 
his disciple, and in all places, with words, 
commandments, entreaties, and urgings, so that they do 
not fall from the pure mind, and always look diligently 
that the doctrine and preaching remain pure and 
unadulterated, for it all lies in this. Speak then: 


V. 3.4. As I reminded thee, that thou stayedest at 
Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, and 
commandedst some that they should not teach 
otherwise, neither take heed to the fables, and to the 
genealogies, which have no end, and bring up 
questions, more than correction, unto God in faith. 

(4) These "some," as the apostle means here, were 
certainly not bad men, but of the high apostles, Peter and 
the other disciples. They saw how the apostles dealt 
according to the law of Moses, as did the other Jews, 
and boasted of it when they came among the Gentiles, 
reproaching them and saying, "This is what Peter and 
the other chief apostles do. What about Paul? He did not 
walk with Christ, nor did he hear him; we have seen that 
the others live and do so, therefore you also must live 
and do so. That was almost the main thing; they were 
driven to make the law necessary, not for the sake of 
Mosiah, but rather for the sake of the apostles, who thus 
kept it. These were the disciples of the great apostles, 
who so often saw their miraculous signs and heard many 
a beautiful sermon and doctrine, in addition to which the 
judgment at Jerusalem was passed by the apostles, Acts 
15:1 ff. 15, 1. ff. They have not yet attained the right 
understanding. 

(5) Because these are blinded by such light, since the 
gospel was preached so purely and brightly, and 
penetrated and departed by force, as never happened 
again, and have lain in this mud, to which they forced 
themselves and other people: what wonder if such things 
happen to us? although we are so equipped by God's 
grace, because we have such light, that we can easily 
judge such error; shall also have no need, because we 
are still with each other, and the word so diligently. 











Otherwise, if we did not continue in this way, a false 
preacher would soon arise who could do more harm in 
an hour than could be done in a year, so that he would 
take a saying or two from Scripture and press them into 
works, so that the doctrine of faith and love would fall 
away. 

(6) That is why | have so often urged that works and 
faith should be well separated from one another. For 
although this has been said and practiced so much that 
everyone knows it, it is still lacking everywhere, when it 
comes to a meeting, that one should judge and judge 
from it, so that one may go right. Faith (I say) is to be 
held against God in conscience, and no law is to be laid 
upon it, whether it be man's law or God's law. Therefore, 
if you hear anyone saying, "You must do such and such 
a thing,” and he wants to put the same thing or work on 
your conscience and set it against God, know that it is 
certainly the devil's teaching, and separate the two as far 
apart as heaven and earth, day and night, so that faith 
alone remains in the heart or conscience, but works are 
drawn outside the conscience to the body. Faith belongs 
above to heaven; works are to be drawn down to earth. 
Faith is directed against God; works against the 
neighbor. Faith is above all laws, and is without law; 
works are under the law, and are servants of all laws. 

(7) Now if anyone comes and reverses these things, 
or mixes them together and becomes one, the pure 
doctrine is already falsified. So we say of works, that they 
should be done to compel and tame the body, that it 
become not too wanton, lustful, and slothful. They say: If 
you do this, you will become pious, and come into the 
state of blessedness, earning eternal life. We are not to 
suffer this addition, which they add, that one must do it if 
he is to be saved in some other way, and that the law 
should be laid upon the conscience, so that the doctrine 
of faith may perish. Likewise also say with other works, 
which one doeth against his neighbor. As when I, being 
with the Jews, eat with them what they eat, likewise also 
with the Gentiles, keeping the manner and law of the 
people, and judging me in their works, | had all manner 
of laws, and have 


862 Erl. S1, 380-283. interpretations on the 1st epistle to the Timothyiis. W. IX, 496-498. 863 


but in conscience no law; for | do not do the works in the 
opinion that | am forced to do them, or that | thereby 
become pious before God, but that | am guilty of sending 
myself to the will and benefit of my neighbor, even 
though it helps me nothing before God, because | 
already have the treasure through faith. 

8 The apostles also did this, keeping the law of 
Moses with the others, but keeping it freely; not that they 
thereby made a conscience neither good nor evil, or that 
they had to do it, but teaching and concluding thus, as 
Peter says Acts 15:10, 11: "We will not put a yoke upon 
the necks of our disciples, which neither our fathers nor 
we have been able to bear; but we believe through the 
grace of Jesus Christ. 15:10, 11: "We will not put a yoke 
upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our 
fathers nor we have to bear: but we believe that through 
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, 
even as they also are saved." With this judgment he 
abolishes and purely takes away all works and laws. 
Therefore, it is clear that the apostles do not raise the 
law, but only grace, that the conscience alone hangs on 
Christ; but law and works they teach by their example, 
by keeping, for the sake of the people, not for the sake 
of the conscience. Those disciples still fell on it, added 
to it, left the doctrine and judgment of mere grace, and 
took up the works which the apostles did, and urged 
them on the conscience, saying, Thus and thus must 
thou do, or not do. 

(9) Thus the false teachers broke down and 
dampened the faith, struck down grace, and cast out 
Christ. For whoever comes to help the conscience and 
reconcile God with works has already lost grace with 
Christ and all the treasure. We will also see, when some 
are taken away, through whom God receives the 
gospel, how soon the false teachers will invade again, 
and what a flood of sins of works will swarm in; how 
many have already torn down the spirits of the red, and 
attached the rabble to themselves! Therefore, it is 
necessary to watch and instruct without ceasing, 
especially the preachers, to keep the faith pure and not 
to add anything to the doctrine. For as soon as you mix 
faith and works and do not separate them, it is already 
lost, and no matter how much it is taught and preserved, 
it is much more easily obscured and destroyed. 





changed. | am not saying that one should not do works, 
but that one should not bring them before God and put 
them on. 

010 Therefore saith St. Paul, that his disciple 
Timothy should take heed, first, that they teach not 
otherwise; and secondly, that they take no heed to the 
fables and genealogies. These are two hindrances to 
the gospel: one, if one teaches otherwise, that is, as has 
been said, that one drives the law and works into the 
consciences; the other, if the devil, when he sees that 
he cannot overthrow the faith straightway, drives with 
cunning, and creeps in from behind, and throws out 
useless questions, that one may be troubled, and 
meanwhile the main thing remains behind; as there are, 
of dead saints and departed souls: where do they 
remain? whether they sleep? and the like. There is 
always one question after another, so that there is no 
end to them. There, the tiresome presumption worries 
about unnecessary and useless things, which are 
neither commanded, nor do they serve the cause. Thus 
the devil comes behind the people, opens their mouths, 
so that they gape at it and lose it. And when a fool 
appears, who also wants to be seen, throws up 
something new and strange, so that it should be said 
that he is more learned than others, the mob bursts into 
a mob, opens its eyes, ears and mouth. So they keep 
silent about faith and love, because they think it is daily 
bread, which they have heard and know enough, and it 
is annoying to hear one thing all the time. 

011 And it came to pass in those days, that the Jews 
also forsook the right doctrine, and fell into divers fables, 
of which they have many, concerning the fathers, and 
concerning genealogies, and were pleased to number 
almost every male among them, and every city had a 
genealogy, wherein the Levites numbered their tribes 
and generations by the year. And especially they took 
care of the births of the fathers, which are told in the 
book of Chronicles, according to their tribes and 
members, that they calculated which of the others had 
been father, brother, son, cousin and friend, as the line 
went on one after the other from one member to the 
other, through each lineage; which is a far-flung, 
confused thing that cannot be figured out. Likewise 
fables and 


864 


Erl. 51, SS3-28S. 


Our teachers have also asked us questions about the 
lineage of Christ and Mary, and much more about the 
work of fools. There has been no one to say: What are 
we doing? or: What is the use of our knowing? Such 
hostile, ugly forwardness is the heart of man, which can 
never stop doing such useless things. 

(12) Therefore St. Paul says, "You must fight tooth 
and nail to prevent such useless fables and babblings 
from arising, for they do not improve anyone, but only 
hinder faith and cause quarrels and disputes, because 
each one wants to be right. As, of the different souls, one 
says otherwise, the other so, and each thinks that his 
opinion should be valid. But we say thus: that we should 
not know nor want to know what God does not want to 
reveal to us; let it pass and let Him take care of it. But 
we have other, necessary things to do, since we spend 
our lives with them: how faith and love may stand and 
walk rightly, that the conscience may be well with God, 
and the body may be kept rightly in restraint, wife and 
child, and to serve anyone who may be ours, since we 
live on earth. They leave this to be done as if they had 
done it, when they have never really come to it, boasting 
and puffing themselves up with great art, so that they will 
be praised. For this reason it was necessary that St. 
Paul commanded the two obstacles to be warded off; 
although his faithful counsel and warning, unfortunately, 
did not help much. Therefore, beware of all other 
teachings, 1) and remain only on that which follows: 


V. 5. For the main sum of the commandment is 
love from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, 
and from undimmed faith. 


This is the summa summarum of the righteous 
Christian doctrine, in which everything lies. What is the 
use of many useless questions and fables? All that God 
gives and wants is love, and such love that comes from 
a pure heart, a good conscience and uncolored faith. Let 
us see this one after the other. 

14: So we have been given a "pure heart".

teaches to make one cast out the impure thoughts. This 
is well said and done, but it is not enough to get rid of 
them; as experience shows that if you knock out one, 
you knock in ten; if you knock out ten, you knock in a 
hundred, so that it is not possible to get a pure heart by 
our own sweeping. 2) The more we try to stop, the more 
blood and flesh flow. Blood and flesh flow without 
ceasing, the more one wants to stop and fight. That is 
why St. Paul urges that the heart should first become so 
pure that it does not become conscience-stricken. 
Likewise he also says to Titus 1:15: "All things are pure 
to the pure"; and Christ says Matt. 5:8: "Blessed are the 
pure in heart, for they shall see God. Thus, "to have a 
pure heart" does not mean merely to remember nothing 
impure, but rather, when through God's word the 
conscience is enlightened and assured that it is not 
defiled by the law: thus, that a Christian may know that it 
does him no harm whether he keeps it or not; yes, do 
well that which is otherwise forbidden, or omit that which 
is otherwise commanded; it is no sin to him, for he can 
do none, because the heart is pure. But again, an 
unclean heart defiles and sins in all things, because it is 
full of laws. But after that, when the heart becomes clean 
from laws, which is not by the word of God, it is also clean 
in 3) thoughts, that it thinks purely of flesh and blood, is 
not stingy, angry, nor unchaste. But this is still the lowest 
purity; but that is the highest, from which this flows and 
follows. 

(15) Whoever then is of such a pure heart sees God, 
says Christ Matt. 5:8. "Seeing God" is not what the 
sophists dream, but recognizing God, namely, when the 
heart sees His goodness and grace, and does not doubt 
that He is its Father, recognizes His good will and natural 
way, there is then neither sin nor wrath. No conscience 
can come to this, if it is driven by the law. For where the 
law is, there is sin; where sin is, there is an evil, unclean 
conscience. 


2) In the old editions: one. 

3) We have put "an" instead of "on" (i.e. without) in the old editions. 
Here a confusion of "an" and "on" must have occurred during printing. 
At the end of §17, instead of "an sein", "on sein" could be put; but here 
it is our: an. 


866 en. 51, pss-2e7. interpretations on the ist epistle to Timothy. w. ix, sor-sos. 


867 





As long as you sin and look at the law, you do not see 
God, because you consider Him to be a wrathful judge. 
But that is not seeing God, but seeing an executioner and 
a cane-master. So now no one can see him as he is, 
except he who is rid of the law. 

(16) If this first purity, which God sees, remains, the 
other purity is also there, so that the evil desire is 
subdued and becomes less, and pure thoughts follow. 
So here you get rid of works, as there in the conscience 
of the law; for from this everything follows that the law is 
kept, and sin is taken away. But because the law 
remains, neither heart nor work can be pure, but remains 
vain unbelief and evil thoughts against God, Titus 1:15: 
"Nothing is pure to the unclean, but both their mind and 
conscience are unclean." So that it may be understood 
by a rough example of our nature: The pope has 
burdened the consciences with laws, imposed so many 
ordinances, consecrations, masses, prayers, fasts, that 
whoever clings to them, thinking, "So and so you must 
do," can have no rest nor good conscience, and cannot 
regard God otherwise than as angry. For if they do not 
pray, they have no peace; but if they pray, there is just 
as little peace, that they have not prayed with devotion, 
or ever so purely as they should. There the conscience 
always remains captive, and they cannot do any work 
with a pure heart. Recently, there is nothing but vain sin 
and fear caused by the law, which one can never get rid 
of, because the law lies there; therefore one can also 
never see God. 

(17) But if the law depart from me, and | be not 
troubled with it, sin and disquietness of conscience are 
also gone: then mayest thou behold God aright, and see 
his good pleasure, that he is not displeased, but is 
pleased with what thou doest. Thus the heart is pure, and 
the conscience good. In the same way | speak of all other 
laws, creatures and states. If you think you must do it, 
there is already a conscience from the law, plus sin and 
an unclean heart. You always do either too much or too 
little, and the longer and more you struggle with it, the 
more you defile yourself, making sin and an evil 
conscience. 





Whoever then wants to be free from sin, 1) to have a 
good conscience and a pure heart, must not be bound 
by any law on earth. 

018 And if thou sayest, Yea, all these things are yet 
spoken of men's laws; but how sayest thou of God's law? 
For those are easy to deal with, which, as they are made 
by men, may also be taken away by men, and none of 
them shall be smitten upon the conscience, nor bind it, 
nor make it sin before God. But these, namely God's 
laws, he wants to keep strictly, so that neither a letter nor 
a tittle of them perishes, as Christ says (Matth. 5, 18), so 
that one cannot transgress them with a good 
conscience. But if there is an evil conscience, there is 
also sin, and the heart cannot be pure, nor see God, for 
the conscience tells you that he is of sin and wants to 
punish it, and sees nothing but unmercy. How can one 
escape from the law here, have a pure heart and a good 
conscience? 

19 Answer: Divide the people into two parts, and 
separate those who are in the spirit from those who are 
without the spirit. To those who are not in the Spirit this 
doctrine does not enter in, nor is it preached to them; for 
they cannot be pure in heart, or have a good conscience. 
But those who have the Holy Spirit, of whom we speak 
now, though they have sinned and feel sin, yet they have 
something higher and better than the law. So the law 
ceases, not that it should be taken away and no longer 
apply or be kept, as the law of the pope and of men 
ceases; but (as | said) that a higher thing should be 
given, so that it may be subdued, and that enough may 
be done for it. 

20 So that it may be seen in an example: If | have 
fallen into sin, and have done contrary to God's 
commandment, the law is soon there, wanting to make 
my conscience evil and God angry. But faith, on the other 
hand, holds up God's Word and Christ, my Savior, who 
was given to me by God with all that is in him. Thus | 
speak by the same faith. It is true that | have sin in me, 
and the law says that | should be pure in heart, have no 
evil thoughts, and be a good man.

W. IX, 503-506. 869 





nor desire; but | find it otherwise in the flesh, which is evil 
through and through. 

(21) | also divide myself into two parts, namely, the 
flesh and the old Adam, and the spirit or new man; in my 
heart | have Christ through faith, so | contend in two 
ways. First. If | should deal with the law, | have already 
lost, because | can never do enough for it, yes, only fall 
deeper into sin; so the evil conscience and unclean heart 
remains, cannot escape the law. Secondly. But if | take 
hold of Christ and cling to him, the law cannot take hold 
of me. For Christ is ever no sinner, having done so much 
as the whole law would have, that it can neither forbid 
nor command him, nor require him to do anything that he 
has not done. He is so full of good that he can neither 
want nor do anything but good. Summa, he has no law, 
and is above all law, yes, it is completely dead in him. 
Since Christ is mine through faith, and | am his in turn, 
no law can accuse me, as little as Christ. And even if it 
comes here and wants to attack me, | reproach it for this 
and say, "If | have done everything and more than you 
want, and even if | still have an evil desire in the flesh, | 
turn my eyes upward to Christ, who is mine and gives 
me all that he has; so his purity is also mine; so it can do 
nothing to me. But when | look down, | still find much that 
is unclean, for which the law has right over me. 

(22) This is the main thing we have to learn, the art 
and all the power of how to be right in it: that even if we 
feel the lust of the flesh, or even if we have fallen into sin, 
we may still say 2) | will be free from the law; | have 
neither law nor sin, but am righteous: | still want to be 
free from the law; | have neither law nor sin, but am pious 
and righteous. If | cannot say this, | must despair and 
perish. The law says: You have sin. If | say yes, | am lost; 
if | say no, | must have a strong foundation on which to 
stand, so that | can refute it, and receive the no. How can 


1) In the old editions: "zwo". 
2) Jenaer: still. 








But if | say it, itis true, 2c., and the Scripture also testifies 
that | was born in sins; where then will | take the no? Of 
course | will not find it in my bosom, but in Christ, there | 
must get it, reproach it to the law, and say: Behold, he 
can say no against all laws, has also his reason, because 
he is ever pure and without sin. He also gives me the no, 
so that even though | should say yes, when | look at 
myself and see that | am a sinner, and cannot be right 
with you, but feel that there is nothing pure about me and 
see God's wrath, | still have this next to it, that his 
righteousness is mine; so | am no longer in sin. We must 
come to this point so that we can say that we are 
righteous and pure as consistently as Christ himself can 
say it; all of which is done through faith. 

(23) These are the things which are to be preached, 
and the sum of the whole law, saith St. Paul; which will, 
and hath no rest, that thou come to have love from a pure 
heart, knowing neither law nor sin, and seeing God 
righteously "of a good conscience. After that (as follows) 
"of undimmed faith", that is, that it is not preached with 
words alone, and played with thoughts in the heart, but 
that the faith is fundamental, undoubted, and certain, so 
that it is all there. That is so much as to say that there is 
no law, neither of God nor of man. Man's law falls in such 
a way that it is completely abolished and left behind; you 
may not yet add anything to Christ's law; it has not come 
about because of this; it can certainly be abolished by 
men, because it is set by them. But to abolish God's law, 
Christ alone must do it. The latter must come to an end 
in death, or before; but the former is eternal; therefore 
one must have him to whom it has no right, who has done 
enough for us. The Holy Spirit must create such a 
fundamentally good, uncolored faith, which grasps such 
things; he aligns these three things, makes us holy, pious 
and full of God, does not let us sink, does not frighten the 
good conscience, does not let the pure heart err. This 
alone is necessary to know; and although not all feel it, 
some do. 

24 But diligence is to be taken, that one does not 
teach otherwise. This happens then (like 


870 Eri. si, 2W-S9S. Interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. ix, sos-svs. 871 





If one wants to make people pious with laws and rule 
their consciences, as the papists have done up to now, 
and all the red spirits are still doing, so that people are 
led to act with their thoughts and dreams with God, they 
will never learn correctly what a pure heart, a good 
conscience and untainted faith are, and they will not 
understand anything about it, even today the pope with 
all the high schools, what the three words mean. For 
they dream that a pure heart is one that thinks no evil 
and is not attached to any creature, so that creature and 
thought are separated from one another. Now if a man 
has a wife and does his work with a cheerful heart, or if 
a woman looks after her child and waits for him, this is 
not called a pure heart, because all this cannot happen 
without thoughts clinging to it. One must think daily of 
food, money, work, and other things; there are creatures 
which (as they say) one must get rid of, so that one's 
thoughts are nothing else than to sit and speculate in 
heaven, and think nothing else but after God. It follows, 
then, that Christ did not have a perfectly pure heart when 
he made the blind see and the sick heal. He raised the 
dead, and in all other works; for he had to take care of 
the creature: meanwhile, where did his heart and 
thoughts remain only for God? 

(25) Thus the ladders of the blind have led us, and 
innumerable books have been written full of such 
speculations, how to get rid of creatures; but they are 
nothing else, but only dreams and the devil's seduction. 
It is not possible to purify the heart with thoughts; 
otherwise no one would be so impure as God Himself, 
who sees all wickedness, remembers it, and is angry 
about it; indeed, He takes care of all creatures, creates 
and works everything Himself. But purity is found in this 
(as enough has been said), that the conscience is good, 
that man does for works what he wants, that the heart is 
not bound to it; and does it not because he wants to do 
a meritorious work, or that he has to do it, but with all 
love and desire, only because it pleases God. So then it 
is pure, and yet deals with all creatures, doing 
everything freely, as 


When he puts it into his hands, he does not let any law 
or sin make him unclean from any thing, but all things 
are clean to him. For he sees God rightly, and has an 
untainted faith, without which such a work cannot be 
done. Then all the commandments are fulfilled, so that 
both the heart is right toward God and the works toward 
the neighbor. Now whatever is not preached according 
to the measure and rule is already lacking in the right 
way; therefore it follows: 


V. 6, 7: Whereof some have erred, and turned to 
useless babblings, desiring to be masters of the 
Scriptures, and understanding not what they say, or 
what they set forth. 


(26) They have missed the main sum (he says), they 
do not know what the three pieces are, they only play 
with thoughts, and after that they go out; as they err and 
miss, so they teach other people also. Nor do you ever 
hear anyone preaching how to have a pure heart and a 
good conscience; only others are engaged in useless 
talk, saying, "You must do and stand like this," 2c. and 
fall into vain works and commandments. 

27 But is not this a bold apostle, that he should call 
the disciples of the high apostles, and their successors, 
the pope and his company, idle talkers, and say that 
none of them know what they say and do, and freely 
conclude that where faith and love are not preached, it 
is all idle talk, and neither they that preach, nor other 
men, know what they do, though it have appearance and 
name, as excellent as it may be? They want to be 
praised as if they were masters of the Scriptures, which 
they alone can and should interpret, thus opening 
people's mouths; yet they themselves do not understand 
the sayings they use, nor do they know what they 
contain. This happens because they lack the three 
pieces mentioned above, in which the summa of 
Scripture is summarized; but they lead the sayings that 
have such things in them, but do not see them; and must 
let themselves be interpreted by them in their dreams, 
contrary to the right doctrine. 

28 From this it follows that they do not know what 
they set, order and want to take for doctrine. As when 
one preaches God's commandment, everything is to be 
interpreted (as St. Paul has said before) that it calls for 
love 


872 


Erl. 51, LOL-L95. 


Sermon on 1 Tim, 1, 3-11. 


873 


W. IX, 509-511. 





of a pure heart, a good conscience, and undimmed faith, 
it is rightly conducted and used. They know nothing of 
this; therefore they do other things contrary to that which 
the law requires, saying, Keep this and that, and thou 
shalt be pious; deceiving themselves and other people 
thereby, and making only evil consciences, entangled 
with laws, and impure hearts without faith and love. 

29 Then you have a common judgment of all who do 
not teach the faith, that they all must lack and err. They 
cannot teach, they will not hold their peace: so they go 
forth, lacking this, not meeting that; nor will they alone 
have right and power to establish and _ order, 
understanding neither Scripture, as much as they have it, 
nor their own zeal; lacking on all sides the right 
understanding of the spirit and their deeds. That is to say, 
the high, learned and holy people vaunted and painted. 
Now follow on: 


Vv. 8. 9. But we know that the law is good, if any 
man needs it aright, and know this, that no law is 
given to the righteous, but to the unrighteous and 
disobedient, to the wicked and sinners, to the unholy 
and unspiritual, to murderers of fathers and 
murderers of mothers, to slayers, to whoremongers 
2c. 


(30) So far it has been said how those who preach 
the law do not preach it rightly, so that they catch the 
consciences with it and drive them to such works that one 
should be counted worthy before God. After this, the 
summa is deleted, that no one can come before God or 
to God by works, but must first be righteous before God, 
and be born of God, who should do a work that is good. 
And that finally this is the opinion that the law wants so 
much that a person has a pure heart, a good conscience 
and untainted faith in God, from which love flows; in this 
one should remain and seek nothing more; and whoever 
preaches and lives in this way, that he preaches and lives 
rightly. 

Now St. Paul answers a question that he also raises 
in other epistles. For someone might say, "If the law is 
not useful for promoting us against God, why did he give 
it and not keep it more? 








but that one should have it and do it; of which sayings 
there are many everywhere in Scripture. To this St. Paul 
answers thus: Yes, | confess that the law is good; but it 
is not So good: many people are found who misuse it and 
lead it unjustly. Therefore it is good, where one needs its 
right. But again, it is not good, but harmful, where it is not 
rightly needed. 

Therein also is the reason of our doctrine to answer 
for what the law is given, 1) and how it is to be used. For 
this must remain in brief, as it has been said, that no one 
can become righteous by having any law laid upon his 
conscience, but rather by driving it away. If you force it to 
do so, you only make it worse. 

(33) Therefore the right custom of the law is not to 
lead in where it belongs out. To understand this custom 
correctly, you must divide man into two parts and 
separate them well, namely into the old and the new, as 
St. Paul divided him. Leave the new man completely free 
of laws. Drive the old man without ceasing with laws, and 
only let him not rest from them, then you have used it 
rightly and well. The new man cannot be helped at all by 
works, he must have something higher, namely Christ; 
he is neither law nor work, but a gift and present, pure 
grace and goodness of God. When this comes into the 
heart through faith, we become righteous before God. 
But if you think that you are doing a work, leading an 
order or profession, in order to become pious before God, 
you have already missed the right use of the law and 
denied Christ. If you want Him to help you without any 
works, then you want to help yourself with works; then 
the law is carried too high and too far. For then thou 
castest Christ out of the heart, where he alone should sit 
and reign, and puttest the law and thy works in his place; 
as all false teachers do, and cannot do otherwise. So now 
(I say) the new man has his humble portion, Christ with 
all his goods in his heart; by which he has all that he 
ought to have, may no more have any thing, either in

34 But the old man, who is without glory, and not pure 
in heart, and does not have Christ, must have the law, 
and be always made void with works. For where Christ 
is not, you must not trust any man with anything good, 
for he must be under the devil. Therefore no wickedness 
is too much or too great for him, and no one may do 
anything else to him, except to commit all sin, vice and 
shame wherever he finds room and place; nor can he be 
inclined to any good, much less do any good, but only 
evil and wickedness. For this reason it is necessary that 
the law should come and prevent evil; it serves this 
purpose alone, and is nothing other than a deterrent to 
stop the wicked from doing what they would like to do. 
Then God comes and scares with the law, commands 
that it be driven into people violently, so that they must 
fear death, disgrace and hell; not because he means to 
make them better, but so that the wickedness they are 
full of may be controlled, so that they may not break out 
and do according to their will. So it is not given for the 
sake of the pious, but for the sake of the wicked, as St. 
Paul, Rom. 13, 4. 5. teaches about the worldly 
authorities 1). If the world were not evil, no authority, 2) 
rights, swords, princes, judges, fire, gallows and wheels 
would be allowed. Those who are not Christians are all 
to be kept under restraint and fear, or, if they break out, 
to be punished and choked. Summa, all authorities and 
laws are ordered by God to ward off the wicked 2c. 

(85) Just as the secular sword and outward rule are 
neither necessary nor useful for the pious, but only for 
the wicked, so it is also with God's law. The judge has 
nothing to do with a pious citizen who harms no one, but 
only with thieves and murderers; so one must not keep 
dogs for the sake of a sheep, so that no one bites it, for 
no one can harm or be harmed by it, but for the sake of 
wolves one must keep them. If it were not for the wolf, 
there would be no need for guard or watch. So here is

the law, not to the pious, but only to the wicked. This is 
the custom and benefit of the law, that it scares and 
punishes people with all misfortune of body and soul, to 
control wickedness and to ward it off from within; it is 
good for this purpose, not that it makes one pious. 4) It 
only makes an outward appearance that one abstains 
from works; inwardly, however, it remains unresisted. It 
only makes an outward appearance to people that one 
abstains from works; yet inwardly it remains unresisted. 
It serves only that people may have peace, and that each 
one may not exercise his will as he pleases. So it is rightly 
preached and conducted. 

(36) You have already gone too far in adding that it is 
worth something before God and necessary for the 
pious. It should only ring out before the people on earth 
and in the outer being. Another treasure belongs to the 
inner being, this one is not able to do it; the office and the 
honor belong to the Holy Spirit alone; if he is not there, 
all is lost. The Holy Spirit must enlighten the heart and 
set it on fire, so that it may delight in all that is good. If 
you give such to the law, you have misused it, for you 
make it the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit is not the law, 
nor again. If law is there, the Holy Spirit is not there; if it 
is not there, there is no godliness; but if it is there, there 
must be no law. The law should not and cannot make 
one pious, but the Holy Spirit makes one pious in the 
sight of God; if you do not have the Holy Spirit, do not 
think that you can be pious. It is not a work that is in our 
power; it is God's gift, yes, it is the living God, whom we 
cannot overcome with any being, but only by God's 
preaching how Christ has drowned all our sin through his 
blood and death, and has purchased his spirit for us. 

37 When these things sound in the ears, the Holy 
Spirit goes with the word into the hearts wherever he 
wills; for he does not blow on them all, therefore they do 
not all grasp it. But the word does not go out without fruit, 
so it must always be preached, heard, acted upon, and 
practiced, until the Holy Spirit once 


4) So in all editions. Later, in s 39, on the other hand, we find: "that 
it may stand against wickedness.

come; otherwise there is no other way. That you sit in 
the corner, gazing at heaven, and wait when you see 
him coming, is vain deceit; the word is the only bridge 
and way by which the Holy Spirit comes to us. Thus we 
read Apost. 10:44, when Peter preached of Christ, how 
he died and rose again, that the Holy Ghost fell upon all 
them that heard the word. There was no work at all, but 
only the hearing, which brings the Holy Spirit with it. Now 
this is an abuse of the law, that one gives to his works 
that which belongs to the Holy Spirit; whereas the right 
custom is to ward off the wicked and to punish them. 

Now there is another custom, which St. Paul 
emphasizes in other places, which is somewhat more 
subtle, that the law teaches to recognize sin, namely, 
when it is preached that what we are and do is vain sin, 
that a man can also think nothing, desire nothing and 
speak nothing, it is all against God and condemned. So 
that by this custom of the law all the great, beautiful 
works of the saints of works, who want to do enough for 
the law before God, are put down; just as by the previous 
custom the gross, public sins are prevented, which do 
not lead a good appearance at all, but live completely 
unclean and disgraceful 1) so that all the world must say 
that it is condemnable. 

39. Here we find some pious peelers and hypocrites 
who do not murder, steal, commit adultery, or live 
shamefully, but lead an honorable life and conduct 
themselves with gray skirts and hats, put ropes around 
their bodies, pray, fast, and chastise themselves, and 
keep their order most strictly; As has been thought of the 
monks up to now, there are still many fine, honorable 
people on earth, of whom the world cannot say 
otherwise than that they are pious, holy people. Since 2) 
the law has to do with it, and again to resist, it does not 
want to let these be pious, as it did not want to let those 
be evil. Here it rejects good works, there it rejects evil 
works; here it cannot carry out its former office, so that it 
can stand against wickedness, because it has already 
been aligned and carried out, because these people 


1) Wittenberg and Erlanger: shameful. 
2) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "Da, da". 


are beautiful and pious, and blameless before the world. 
But if it has resisted there, they fall on this side again too 
far, that they think, the works, forced by the law, should 
be valid before God. And they want to turn worldly, 
transient righteousness into heavenly, _ eternal 
righteousness. That is why they have to fight on both 
ropes. This is what happens when one says: "Behold, all 
the works that you do in the opinion that you are worth 
something before God are lost and condemned, for there 
is no man on earth who can do a work that pleases God, 
because we are all false and liars, as Ps. 116:11 says. 
The law pronounces judgment on such life, strikes it 
down, and makes it sinful and disgraceful. 

40 This is also a high and very necessary custom. 
That is why the law is such a delightful thing; when it is 
in accordance with the right custom, it defends both 
sides: those from doing evil, and those from not being 
pious. Why is that? Because it is false (as now said), and 
they deceive the people with the appearance and the 
cover. If they want to make it up to God with their works 
and beautiful gestures, what good is the Holy Spirit? Or 
why did Christ come and let it cost Him His blood, so that 
He might obtain for them what they seek with their 
works? But if they can obtain it by the work of the law, 
then Christ ever died in vain; so also Moses, with his law, 
interferes with the Holy Spirit in his office, blasphemes 
and denies Christ. 

Where the doctrine enters and strikes the heart, a 
man, outwardly as pious as he can be, must put down 
his peacock feathers and let his pride fall, so that, if he 
looks at himself rightly, he must confess that he is full of 
mud, poison, envy, anger, fornication, unbelief, more 
than anyone else, even if he can hide the mischief for a 
while out of compulsion and fear, for the sake of 
appearance and honor. Therefore it is not possible to 
become pious by works; indeed, the more one wants to 
make it good, the worse it becomes. Whoever is subject 
to this, the law must prevent him from casting out the 
Holy Spirit, taking his office and putting himself in his 
place. If it is used in such a way as to ward off here and 
there, it is right, and good, and delicious. Thus 


878 Erl. 81, 300-302. interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. IX, 816-519. 


The last thing that remains is that one must have 
something more and better, because the law does not 
help piety, namely, as | said, the Holy Spirit, which St. 
Paul calls a gift of God, which he gives us for free, but 
earned through Christ, and brought in and with the Word. 
1) 

042 But askest thou, How then shall not men do good 
works, and keep the law? Answer: Yes, indeed. The law 
is good, and is well done by all who keep it, preach it, 
practice it, and do it. Why then should one do it? For the 
sake of becoming godly? Answer: No; let it be said, then, 
that by so doing one becomes pious in the sight of the 
world; but in the sight of God it must be something else. 
What is it good for, or why is it given? To prevent one 
from doing evil, and to enforce an outward piety before 
the world. And again, that it may hinder the same worldly 
piety, so that man may not measure himself to be pious 
before God by it, but bring him to confess himself a 
sinner before God, and be condemned. In short, so that 
one knows that keeping the work of the law outwardly is 
of no value before him. 

But if thou wilt be godly, and do righteous good works 
afterward, behold, thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, 
which bringeth Christ unto thee, and planteth him in thee, 
and thee in him, that thou mayest be a new man: which 
shall establish in thee a clean heart, and a good 
conscience, and a sound faith. There you have the right 
custom of the law; where it works (says St. Paul), and it 
is Known that no law is given to the righteous, but to the 
unrighteous, it is good and useful. How this happens is 
sufficiently explained from the foregoing. 

44 The apostle therefore says that it is not given to 
the righteous, but to the unrighteous 2c. Why? Just look 
at the custom. He that is righteous, and hath the Holy 
Ghost, and is pure in heart, and of a good conscience, 
and of an unfeigned faith; what canst thou hinder him 
from doing evil? If he does not, or if he recognizes 
himself as a sinner and does not try to become righteous 
by works, he has waited too long. It is already far 
beyond, has more than the law can give. For he who 


1) Wittenberger: used. 





879 


who has faith knows well that he is a sinner, does not 
think to go to heaven by works, knows that he has 
everything through Christ, therefore no commandment 
can be laid upon him. But the law must be laid down for 
the unrighteous. For what purpose? That they may be 
prevented, or that they may be taught to know what they 
are. 

(45) Thus | have said above that the law of God is not 
abolished, that it is never, which is not possible, but that 
it is understood spiritually, according to the conscience. 
This much is said: The law remains, but the righteous 
has so much, namely, the Holy Spirit and a pure heart, 
so that he does everything the law wants. Take a 
similitude: If a thing goeth as it ought, no man may do it; 
if it doeth whatsoever is wanted, no man may command, 
command, or forbid it. No law may be given to the sun to 
shine and move in the sky, nor to water to flow, nor to 
fire to burn, nor to a tree to grow green and bear fruit, if 
it is otherwise good. And there would have to be a fool 
here who would presume to command such things. If it 
is already there, no one may call it to be there; but if you 
call it to be there, either it must not be there, or if it is 
there, you must be a fool. Augustine gives such a simile: 
Two and three are not guilty of making five together, nor 
may anyone demand it; it is already made thing, that it 
cannot be nor become otherwise. But the law must be 
given only to that which is not yet there, or does not work 
as it should. But when it comes and is present, it must 
cease and fall away. So it is also here with God's law 
and the ten commandments. 

46 Therefore, when the law says, Thou shalt not have 
other gods, thou shalt not use God's name in vain, thou 
shalt keep holy the feast day, thou shalt honor parents, 
thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not 
commit adultery, thou shalt not bear false witness, 2c., it 
is just as much speaking as if it said, Thou art already 
idolatrous, blasphemers, unholy, disobedient, a 
murderer, adulterer, thief and liar. And though thou goest 
not forth with the work, yet art thou in heart full of all 
unrighteousness and lust of evil. For as ours is none 
other, because we are the children of Adam; neither ass 
shall call another sackbearer; as one is, so are they. 


880 Erl. si, 302-304. sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 3-11. 


W. ix, sis-[2i. . 881 





all of them. But the fact that we do not do what we would 
like to do makes us fearful of punishment, disgrace, and 
hardship; if this were not the case, there would be no one 
who did not rob, steal, and murder like the others. So you 
see that the law closes so much everywhere that what it 
demands is not there, but the contradiction. 

47. But since a Christian, as has been said, does all 
that the law would have him do, has a pure heart toward 
God, does good to everyone and does good to no one, 
is already made as he should be, so that he cannot will 
or do otherwise, because he has the Holy Spirit, by 
whom the heart is inflamed with desire for all good; 
Therefore you can no more command him to be pious 
than you can require a man to be a man, or a woman to 
be a woman, because he was made that way before any 
law was given, and nature does not bear otherwise. But 
if you approach and want to command such a man, | may 
say that you are a fool and nonsensical, in that you 
demand what he 1) has already paid for and given, and 
forbid what he 1) cannot do. Therefore it is clear enough 
that the law has nothing to do with the pious; but if it has 
to do with someone, he does not have to be pious or 
righteous. Think God is not a fool to do what is already 
done. Because he demands from all the world: Do this 
and that, he will have decided that it is all full of sins, and 
will force it to confess such things. So then, as St. Paul 
says, the law remains on the unrighteous, to hinder them 
and frighten them, until they know that they must have 
something different and better, so that the law may be 
done enough, and so be rid of it. 

48 Thus you say: If it be so, is there none righteous 
on earth? For St. Paul himself commands Timothy hard 
before, and says, v. 3: "As | have reminded," 2c. And 
soon after, v. 18: "This commandment | command thee." 
There is a commandment that he also further says 
"command" and "command". Yes, how full is all 
Scripture, Old and New Testament, of such 
commandments? Are not Paul and Timothy or the 
Christians pious? Or, what 


1) Wittenberger: es. 





may he say, "No law is given to the righteous," and go to 
and give it himself? 

49. according to the spirit the believer is 2) righteous, 
without all sin, without any law; according to the flesh he 
still has sin 2c. Therefore, take before you a devout 
Christian who has a pure heart, a good conscience and 
an untainted faith, who will have to say thus: Even 
though | have a pure heart, a good conscience, righteous 
faith, yet the flesh, the tongue, the fist is not pure, that is, 
the old scold that | have by the neck is still unclean. The 
faith that leads us up to heaven to God does not want to 
suffer any law, there the heart has as much as one can 
always demand, a cheerful courage, desire for good, 
friendly and submissive heart that submits to everyone; 
there everything is pure and righteous. But the flesh does 
not yet want to follow this by heart; all kinds of filth are 
still clinging to it and evil desire, care for food, fear of 
death, avarice, anger and hatred; the filth always 
remains next to faith, so that it can beat and fight itself 
out with it. Because these things are still there, the 
Scriptures count us in this respect as unrighteous and 
sinners, that we have to follow the law of the flesh just as 
much as they have to resist the lust of the flesh and to 
curb it. But even this is done with the air of the Spirit, not 
with vexation and displeasure. For herein is the 
difference between the two: both are restrained by the 
law; but they that are in the spirit have a willing, cheerful 
heart, but they have not. Therefore it is given to these 3) 
and not imputed, even though there is still sin; but those 
are condemned, because they have no desire and love 
for it. 

50 Therefore the righteous man has all that he should 
have, but must do no good work to be righteous; for he 
must do nothing for godliness, but receive and receive 
the gospel, and come under the shadow of Christ. When 
therefore he hath received it, he doeth good works. 
According to that which he has received, he may do no 
law, and is clean. But after that which he is yet to receive, 
he may yet of the law. So divide a Christian into two 
parts, that he may be both righteous and unrighteous.

The Holy Spirit dwells in the heart, but not in the flesh; 
there the devil dwells with his seed. This is how a man 
must live on earth, so that he is forced and compelled 
by the law, so that he does not do evil, but remains 
uncoerced by the spirit, because he does good by 
himself. This lasts until he dies. On the last day we will 
be pure in body and soul, without all evil desire, yes, 
heaven and earth will become full of good. But now, 
because flesh and blood lives, [it] is not possible, it must 
stir; what it sees, it notices that it either has love for it, or 
turns away from it. This remains in one more and 
stronger, in the other less, until death. That's why you 
have to work at it from day to day, so that you can fight 
it out.

St. Paul, and commands the others to stick to the pure 
doctrine and not to teach anything else. For it is also a 
part of the ministry not to let false doctrine come in, lest 
the heart again be defiled with carnal conceit and 
doctrine; there one should guard as one can, lest the 
conscience be defiled thereby, as must happen where it 
falls to it. This is the most important thing; for if the 
doctrine remains right, and the conscience is not 
corrupted with other doctrines, then life and works can 
be well advised and helped. Summa Summarum: 
According to the spirit there is no law; according to the 
flesh there is law, for it does not do what it should do, 
but the spirit does it all. Understand therefore the saying 
which teaches why the law is given, and the two usages 
of the law. 


B. D. Martin Luther's sermon from the Summa of the Christian Life on 
1 Tim. 1, 5. 6. 7. *) 


Held at W6rlitz on November 24, 1532. 


So St. Paul fasted in short words the summa of 
the whole Christian life, 
1 Tim. 1,5. 6. 7..: 


The main sum of the commandment is: love from 
a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and from 
undyed faith, which some have lacked, and have 
turned to idle talk. They want to be masters of the 
Scriptures, and do not understand what they say or 
what they say. 





Preface. 


Dear friends, you know how God has earnestly 
commanded everyone to hear and learn His dear Word, 
for He has cost Himself much and set about bringing it 
into the world, setting all the prophets to it, even sending 
His own Son into the world for it, having Him crucified 
and put to death, persecuting all the apostles over it and 
all the Christians. 


*Luther preached this sermon in W6rlitz, a small town between Dessau and Wittenberg in Anhalt-Dessau, before the three princes of 
Anhalt, Johann, Joachim and Georg, and the younger margrave of Brandenburg, together with their court servants and about "ten peasants". 
(Cf. Tischreden, Cap. 22, § 13. St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, 637 f.) On November 23, 1532, Luther, accompanied by Melanchthon and Cruciger, 
had come to Worlitz for a parley with the princes, and already on November 24 he went back to Wittenberg, as we learn from a letter of 
Luther to Hausmann of that date (Walch, old edition, vol. XXI, 1402). On the latter day, a Sunday, the sermon will probably have been 
preached. Cruciger transcribed the same. Already on January 2, 1533, Luther sent a printed copy to Hausmann (Walch, 1. 6. Col. 1403, § 
2.). The first printing was done by Joseph Klug in Wittenberg. In the collective editions: Wittenberger (1556), vol. |, p. 456; Jenaer (1568), 
vol. VI, p. 32b; Altenburger, vol. VI, p. 33; Leipziger, vol. XI, p. 449; Erlanger, 1st edition, vol. 19, p. 206 and 2nd edition, vol. 18, p. 270. In 
1723, Pastor |. u. Schwenizel at Halle procured a new reprint of this sermon from the Jenaer edition. We give the text according to the second 
edition of the Erlangen edition, which brings the first printing, comparing the Wittenberg and the Jena, also the Latin translation of this sermon, 


which is in the Latin Wittenberg edition, lom. VII, toi. 311b.

and order the one to act faithfully, and the other to listen 
diligently. And if there were no other reason for doing 
this, except that it is God's good pleasure and will and 
strict commandment, it would be reason enough for all 
things. For we, as creatures, owe it to our Lord and 
Creator to be obedient and to do this with all our will, 
since He has given us so much good and still does it daily 
that we can never thank Him enough for it. 

2 Now he does not leave it at that, and will not only 
have it laid up for us as a commandment, or require it as 
an owing service, but also promises great fruits and 
benefits, which we shall have of it, and lets it be 
proclaimed, that the greatest and most beautiful service 
of God shall be done to him by it. For he also is a great 
Lord, whom we serve, having many and various 
ministries, and can serve him in many things; but this 
some outweighs the others all. For where any pious 
peasant or citizen and subject serves his lord, he also 
serves God; likewise a child or servant and maid in the 
house, if they are obedient, and faithfully do what they 
owe. So also, when princes and lords, father and mother, 
rule well and attend to their office, all this is called serving 
God, for it is His will and command that He requires of 
us. Now, the whole world is full of such service, if only it 
would do it, for each one in his state has his work laid out 
for him by God, so that he should and can serve Him 
daily and always. For we are His own people, and He 
has decreed that His service should be everywhere, and 
that no one should be excused for not knowing how or 
with what he should serve God, or for pursuing other 
things, and seeking his own way of serving God, which 
He has not decreed and commanded, and for leaving in 
place that which is commanded him, as we have done 
until now in our blindness. 

(3) But far above and before all these, he hath 
specially magnified and magnified this ministry, both of 
them that hear his word, and preach it; and hath so 
chosen this portion above all things in the earth, that it 
shall be called specially ministered unto him; for the 
other portions are done unto them. 





people. For this reason he has also appointed a special 
day in the week, on which alone one waits, although one 
otherwise serves God the whole week with other work, 
which he has not bound to any time or special days; but 
this he has specially designed and strictly commanded 
to keep, so that one has time and leisure for it, so that 
no one may complain that he cannot wait before his 
work, nor come to it. He has also arranged special 
places for this purpose, such as churches or houses 
where we meet. Yes, he has endowed and preserved 
the whole priesthood for this purpose, and has provided 
and given all that is necessary for such a ministry, such 
as all kinds of arts and languages, and all kinds of gifts; 
and in short, he has given a special commandment to all 
the world, that they should keep it holy and honorable, 
and in such a way that one must take hold of it, as he 
holds it up very well, and that it should be a precious, 
pleasant service for him, where and when his word is 
acted upon. 

(4) And it would be fine if it could be made customary 
to call going to preaching as going to God's service, and 
preaching as serving God, and to call all who are with 
one another gathered in the right, high service of God. 
Just as the dear apostles and ancient fathers spoke 
before, and came from them, and have remained until 
now, the word is to say: to go to mass and to hear mass 
(as the Pope himself has strictly commanded in his 
decree that everyone should hear mass every Sunday), 
and no one is wont to say: | want to see mass, but: | want 
to hear mass, and actually means as much as: to go to 
God's service, and to hear the sermon or God's word, 
which is the best and most necessary part of the mass. 
Not as the pope does with his secret sacrificial masses, 
where one neither preaches nor hears God's word, 
especially in the part that they consider the greatest, and 
which is called the silent mass. 

For the little word "mass," which seems to have been 
taken from the apostles, means in Hebrew as much as a 
service of interest or joy, 


1) In all editions, "Gottesdienst" is written here in one word, but it 
is clear from § 5 that it is better separated here. 


886 Er. (2.) 18, 274-276. interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. IX, 528-S3V. 


as a peasant or feudal lord brings his lord his fair, that is, 
his due interest or service, or indulges his lord, that he 
may recognize him for his lord, and render his 
obedience. So they also said here: | will go to mass, or 
hear mass, as if to say: | will give God his interest or 
indulge, and render and perform his service in the 
highest and most pleasant service; so that to hear mass 
means nothing else than to hear God's word and serve 
God with it. 

(6) | say this now to admonish us why we should 
gladly hear God's word and go to the sermon, because 
it is not only a strict commandment of God, but also has 
the highest promise that it is pleasing to God, and the 
highest, dearest service that we can do for Him, and 
shines as far above all other services as the sun above 
all stars, and the Sabbath or holiday surpasses all other 
common days, and summa, as much as God's kingdom 
surpasses the world's rule. For here everything is 
consecrated and specially chosen, time, person, place 
and church, everything for the sake of the word, which 
makes all things holy for us, so that we may be careful 
and not become so lazy and lax about it, like the 
shameful, full spirits, wno make themselves believe that 
they now have it and can do it all too well, and better than 
it can be preached to them, or like the others also, who 
soon get tired of it and think: O | have often heard this; 
what should 1) | always hear the same? They do not 
know and do not think what a great, excellent thing it is, 
and how high a service of God it is, which they so 
shamefully despise, or so foully forsake and neglect, and 
thereby greatly anger God, that they so surely throw his 
serious commandment to the wind, and let his promise 
be in vain for them, and, as much as is in them, destroy 
such praiseworthy service of God with their example, or 
even hinder it. 

7 For if it were true (as it is not, praise God!), that thou 
couldst do all things well, and as well as the Lord Christ 
himself; neither seest thou how he himself doth so 
minister and do this work,

which he was able to do beyond all measure and was 
not allowed to do anywhere, as we are allowed to do. So 
also St. Paul, the high apostle, though he was learned 
and a great and excellent doctor, still went about 
preaching day and night, and was neither tired nor weary 
of it, as if he knew it all too well. And God Himself, who 
gave it, is so fond of hearing it and standing by it that He 
cannot grow weary of it, and in addition puts so much 
into it and so earnestly orders and commands that it 
should be done and practiced in all the world until the 
last day. Therefore you should be much less weary of it, 
because without it you can do it so heartily, against the 
devil and all temptation. 

(8) And even though you should not be allowed to go 
anywhere, you should not get tired or weary of going to 
God's service for an hour every day or every week, just 
as you did not get tired of the false service before, lying 
in church every day, even walking from one church and 
altar to another, and yet not saying, as now, "Oh, it is 
nothing new, | have seen it every day,” but thinking: | 
went to mass yesterday and today and every day, but 
tomorrow | will go. Now you should do much more, 
because you know that this is the only true mass and 
service, and say: Even though | could do it exceedingly 
well, when it is not, | still want to serve God in honor and 
obedience, and hear the sermon for His love and praise, 
so that He may see, my dear Lord, that | would gladly 
serve Him in this high service, of which He thinks so 
much, and so much on it, that | could comfort myself and 
boast of it (whether | would have no other benefit from 
it), that | have done him the most holy work and the 
dearest service, so that all other services are small, and 
are to be counted as a common workday against this 
high feast. 

(9) Whoever does not respect this, nor is moved to 
honor and value God's word, to listen gladly and learn 
where he can, | do not know how to advise him. For | will 
not nor can | drag anyone to it by the hair. Let him who 
despises it despise it anyway, and let him remain a pig 
and a sow, as he is, until the day when God will make 
him a roast for the devil in the eternal, hellish, and 
unbearable world.

fire. For it does not have to be a good man, nor a human 
sin, but the devil's hardening, who can despise it so 
much that God himself has appointed a place and 
space, person, time and days for it, exhorts and entices 
him to it by his commandment and promise so highly and 
expensively, and lays it all at the door for nothing, After 
that you should run to the end of the world and not pay 
with gold 1) or silver, because it is such an easy service 
that it costs you no effort nor work, money nor goods, 
without only that you present your ears to hear or your 
mouth to speak and read, that there is no easier work to 
do. For though the danger follows that you must bear the 
cross and suffer over it, yet the work of it is itself as easy 
as no other easy work. If you can sit day and night in the 
alehouse, or otherwise wash and chat with good fellows, 
sing and shout, and not get tired, nor feel the work, then 
you can also sit for an hour in church and listen, serving 
and pleasing God. What would you do if he made you 
carry stones, or walk in a cage, or do other hard work? 
as we have been made to do until now, since we have 
gladly done everything we have been told, and have 
been made to do it with vain lies and deceit, for money 
and goods and our bodies. 

(10) Now it is the wicked devil that blinds men so, and 
makes them so full and weary, that we regard not the 
treasure we have in the dear word, and go about so 
roughly, and become like wild beasts. Therefore let us 
take it to heart, and think, as often as we preach, read 
or hear God's word, whether in church or at home, from 
father, mother, masters, wives 2c., and gladly accept, 
where we can have it, that we are in the right, high, holy 
service of God, which is well pleasing to him out of 
measure. With this you could warm up and stimulate 
yourself to hear the same all the more gladly, and God 
would give that it also produces fruit, more than anyone 
would want to talk about. For it never comes to pass 
without great fruit, where it is meant in earnest, that thou 
shouldest not

You may not see it now, but in time it will be found and 
revealed. But the same would be too long to tell now, 
and may not all be told. 


This is the preface to the sermon of St. Paul, to 
awaken us to hear God's word more diligently, as it 
would be necessary to remember daily and in every 
sermon. And St. Paul's text also serves this purpose. For 
in it he punishes the shameful spirits who, with their 
cleverness, fall into God's word, and soon make 
themselves believe that they can no longer hear it, nor 
learn it from anyone, turning to useless chatter, which is 
something new or strange that the rabble likes to hear, 
wanting to be the master of the Scriptures and of 
everyone, and to teach all the world, and yet not knowing 
what they say or do. For this is the very plague that 
follows: Where God's word is not pursued with 
earnestness and diligence, and the disciples become 
disgruntled, the preachers become lazy, the craft must 
soon fall, and the churches become desolate; Then must 
follow such false spirits, who pretend something new to 
draw the rabble to themselves again, and boast of the 
Scripture masters, and yet are always such people, who 
themselves do not know, nor have ever experienced, 
what it is that they teach; as it is already everywhere on 
the way, and God's wrath and punishment of surfeit and 
ingratitude is upon us. 

12. Therefore he begins the epistle to his disciple 
Timothy, that he should see to it that such teachers do 
not arise, who can wash and talk much of the law, bring 
many new questions and teachings, what to do and how 
to be pious, so that they are seen and praised as being 
more learned than others, and yet they never get around 
to teaching anything certain and righteous, meeting 
neither means, beginning nor end, leading only these 
words, one should be pious, do good works, serve God, 
2c., but they themselves do not understand what it 
means. And if one asks them how one should do it, they

W. IX, 533-S3S. 





Work, there a work; here, let yourself be circumcised; 
there, sacrifice so much on the altar; there run to the 
‘monastery, here to the pilgrimage; there, consecrate 
mass 2c. And if this is taught and done, but after that 
another, and always something new, that they still no one 
can consistently and certainly teach nor say: This is it, or 
in it it stands 2c. And yet it is called a delicious thing; they 
can praise and promise so much, as if they alone were 
the right teachers, and reprove and master all others. 

(13) But this would be a right master (he says), who 
could attack the main part, and grasp and hit the whole 
summa rightly, how the heart and conscience and the 
whole man should stand. They know nothing of this; they 
may speak the words, but they lack the sum and final 
opinion of the law; meanwhile they preach and wash out 
of the church window and in through the door, so that no 
one knows where to stop or begin, nor what it is for, or 
what he should improve and comfort himself with. As we 
have seen and experienced so far from our dream 
preachers under the papacy. What then is the summa of 
what one should preach? St. Paul answers: 


V. 5. The main sum of the commandment is love 
from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and 
from unstained faith. 


(14) There it is, there you have grasped it, what 
belongs to it, in the very finest and most complete way; 
and yet it is briefly and quickly said, and well to be 
remembered. So you must do to him: If you want to get 
the law right and take it by the head (so that you know 
what you should do and what you should not do, and how 
you should conduct yourself, and not seek anything 
further, nor beg back and forth), so that you have the love 
that flows from it and goes out of a pure heart and a good 
conscience and uncolored faith. Stay with it. From it all 
right sermons should go and remain in it; which those 
rotten spirits and the weary spirits of none cannot do. It 
does not do (he means to say) with the doctrine of 
various works, since all of it is pieced together and 
begged for, but what the law wants must be there. This 
is called "love"; and such love, flowing as a little water or 
stream, and springing up out of the heart, being pure, 
and having a good conscience, and being right, must be 
the law. 





| have a clear, unadulterated faith. If it goes like this, it 
goes right, or is the whole law opinion and mind absent. 

Now these are deep and true words of Paul, and very 
rich; therefore we must strike them out a little, that we 
may understand them a little, and be accustomed to his 
speech. First, the summa of the whole law, in which it is, 
and all things are contained, he gives it to be love. But 
"love" in German (as everyone knows) means nothing 
else than to be favorable and kind to one from the heart, 
and to offer and show all kindness and friendship 2c. 

(16) Now those also speak such words, preach and 
boast much of love; but they draw it only to their own 
end, and bring it to their own share. Just as the heretics, 
the wicked, and the evil men also have love, but only 
among themselves and what is theirs; meanwhile they 
hate and persecute all pious Christians, that they would 
gladly bring murder upon them where they could 2c. But 
this does not mean love, that | choose one or two people 
who please me and do what | want, and | am friendly 
and favorable to them, and to no one else. It is called a 
party love, which does not go from the pure heart, but is 
a pure flubbery. For "from the pure in heart" it goes like 
this: God has commanded me to let my love go toward 
my neighbor, and to be favorable to everyone, be it my 
friend or my enemy, just as our heavenly Father does, 
letting his sun rise and shine both on the evil and the 
good, and doing the most good to those who defile him 
day and night and abuse his goods with disobedience, 
vices, sins and shame. Item: He rains both on the 
thankful and the unthankful, giving all kinds of things out 
of the earth, money and goods, to the most wicked 
wicked of the earth. From where does he do this? Out of 
pure love, of which his heart is full and overflowing, and 
so freely pours out on everyone, no one excepted, 
whether good or bad, worthy or unworthy. 

(17) That is, a righteous, godly, whole, and complete 
love, which no one paints, nor divides, but goes freely 
over all. The other is a love that is false, if | am a good 
friend of his, who serves me and 


892 Erl. (2.) 18, S81-S83. Sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 5. 6. 7. 


and hold me in honor, and hate him who despises me 
and does not stand with me. For it does not come from 
the heart, which is good and pure, equal to one and 
another, but which seeks only its own, and is full of its 
own love for itself, not for others. For he loves no one 
except for his own sake; looks only to what serves him, 
and seeks his benefit from everyone, not from his 
neighbor. If one praises and honors him, he laughs; 
again, if one looks at him sourly or speaks a word he 
does not like to hear, he is angry and scolds and curses, 
and all friendship is over. On the other hand, "a pure 
heart" is to be so skilled, according to God's word and 
His example, that it may grant and do to each one the 
dearest and best that God grants him and His divine love 
gives him. Now if God can give Judah all good things to 
the traitor or Caipha, as well as to his pious children, why 
should | not also grant it to him? For what can we give 
him that he has not given much more abundantly? 

(18) Yes, you say, he is my enemy and does me 
nothing but harm. Yes, beloved, he is God's enemy also, 
and does him much more harm than he can do to thee 
or to me; but therefore my love shall not be extinguished, 
nor cease from his wickedness. If he is wicked, he will 
certainly find it; but his wickedness shall not overcome 
me, but where | can punish him through love, admonish 
him, or pray for him that he may become better and 
escape punishment, that | shall and will gladly do. But 
that | still want to go to him, and in addition become him 
and do evil, that is not valid; for what is helped me by 
that? | will not become more pious thereby, and only 
make him worse. But this helps me, that | grant him 
everything good, prove and 1) show (where he can 
suffer and accept it differently), pray for him 2c., fo | have 
peace, and may neither bite nor eat myself with anyone, 
and perhaps also help him with it, that he improves 
himself. Otherwise, if | so specialize and express love, | 
will probably get as much displeasure from the one | 
hate as joy and benefit from the others to whom | am 
favorable. That is to say, the well or the water clouded 
and made unclean, 


1) "prove and” is missing in the Erlanger. 





W. IX, 535-538. 893 
That love does not remain pure. Just as the Jews also 
did (against whom St. Paul is speaking here) in that they 
chose and selected those they loved, and made an 
impure, false love; therefore their heart also could not be 
pure. 

(19) By what does the heart become pure? Answer: 
It cannot be purified any better than by the highest purity, 
which is God's word; take this into your heart and act on 
it, and it will be pure. As here, take the word before thee, 
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," Matt. 22:39, 
and judge thyself according to it, and thou shalt see 
whether it will not wash clean and bite out that which is 
of selfishness and self-love. For because he calls you to 
love your neighbor, he excludes no one, whether friend 
or foe, righteous or wicked. For though he be a wicked 
man, and do thee evil, yet for that cause he loseth not 
the name, that he be not called thy neighbor; but 
nevertheless he remaineth thy flesh and blood, and is 
included in the saying, Love thy neighbor. Therefore, if 
you regard him as the word teaches and instructs you, 
your heart will be pure and your love righteous, so that 
you will not make a special, false distinction of person, 
nor regard him differently from another who is righteous 
and does you good. 

(20) It is true that the pious is more loving, and 
naturally everyone likes to be with him, and again shuns 
wild, evil people; but this is still flesh and blood, and not 
yet true Christian love. For a Christian should not draw 
his love from the person, as the love of the world does, 
as a young man from a beautiful mead, a miser from 
money and goods, a lord or prince from honor and power 
2c. That is all a created or borrowed love, which sticks 
by heart to the good it sees in a person, and lasts no 
longer than as long as that person is there and can enjoy 
it. But this love should be a springing love, flowing from 
within the heart, like a fresh brook or water that flows 
continually, and cannot be stopped, nor dried up or dried 
up. So this is what it means: | love you not because you 
are pious or wicked, for | draw my love not from your 
piety, but from 


894 Eni.

895 








from a foreign well, but from my own little fountain, 
namely from the word which is grafted into my heart, that 
is, "Love your neighbor." There it goes forth abundantly, 
and [is] open to every one that hath need of it, and 
meeteth both. Good and evil, friend and foe, yes, to the 
enemies most willingly, as they need it more that | help 
them from their sorrow and their sins; and especially in 
the highest good, that | pray for them, and do all that | 
can, that they also may be redeemed from sins and 
devils. Behold, this means a love poured out of the heart, 
not carried in; for he finds nothing in those 2) from which 
he drew it. But because he is a Christian and grasps the 
word, which is completely pure in himself, the same also 
makes his heart so pure and full of righteous love that 
he lets his love flow out toward everyone and does not 
let himself be hindered, the person be who or how he 
wants. 

(21) Behold, this is how one should preach, if one 
wanted to teach rightly about love (required in the law), 
of which they know nothing, nor do they pay attention, 
although they talk much about the law and discuss love; 
they do not see and do not even think that it must be 
loved in such a way that it springs from within, that man 
has a pure heart. This never falls into their hearts, even 
though they hear and read much about it, and preach it 
themselves; they go about with vain and useless 
thoughts, even with vain dead dreams. Wherefore let all 
other things go in their dignities, whatsoever they preach 
of works and good living, be it circumcision, sacrifice, 
fasting 2c. But so it goes right, if it goes from God's word, 
from a pure heart and righteous faith; that must be the 
source and spring, so before 3) all such things should 
be there. 

22. You can see these things through all the ranks, 
how each one should carry out his commanded office 
and practice works of love. A servant, when he worketh, 
and seeth not farther, nor thinketh, because thus, My 
lord giveth me. 


1) "their" is missing in the Erlanger. ¥ .

my wages, therefore | serve him, otherwise | do not look 
at him 2c., he has not a pure heart or mind, for he does 
not serve except for a morsel of bread; when that 
ceases, he also ceases. But if he is pious and a 
Christian, he is so minded: | will not serve because my 
lord gives me or does not give me, is pious or wicked 
2c., but because God's word stands there, saying to me, 
"Servants, be obedient to your masters, as to Christ 
himself" 2c, Eph. 6, 5. Col. 3, 22. Then it wells up of itself 
out of the heart that has grasped such a word and has 
value, that he says: "Well, | will serve my Lord and take 
my reward; but this shall be my highest, therefore | do it, 
that | may serve my dear God and Lord Christ in it, who 
has commanded me, and knows that it is pleasing to 
Him 2c. There you see a right work out of a pure heart. 
23. So a lord or prince, and he who has to rule, who 
thus thinks: God has commanded me to tule, that | 
should be lord, but if | only see that | have my honor, 
property and power, then my heart is not pure, and yet 
do the works that a prince does, so that the world cannot 
complain about me, nor the emperor and lawyers 
reprove me according to their right, nor punish me, as 
little as a servant who serves for wages, God gives, he 
seeks his own or not: Nor is the heart unclean in the 
sight of God, that the works of none please him; for there 
is not the word of God in it, but his own idol, honor, 
money, and dominion 2c. But if his heart stands thus: 
Because | am in the office where God has placed me, 
and the word has been said, Rom. 12:8, "He who rules,” 
or has an office, "let him be diligent," 2c, then | will 
preside over the same with all faithfulness, for God's 
service and pleasure, since his rule goes and springs 
from a fine, pure, clean heart, hating God and the world's 
pleasure; and is also a love that does not cling externally 
to person or goods and honor, but grows in the heart, 
which has God's word before its eyes, which, because it 
is pure and clean, makes the heart so also. Thus, his 
rule and works are all vain service and pleasant 
sacrifices, because they are according to the word and 
only for the sake of God. Those rag-washers can neither 
teach nor show this, they know nothing more than to 


896 Erl. (2.) 18, 285-287. sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 5. 6. 7. 


shouting: one should be pious when they teach in the 
best way; and only make a legal sermon out of worldly 
law, as the emperor and his scholars preach. But from 
where the heart becomes pure, they have never tasted 
nor thought anything about how it should be led from 
God's word to all kinds of states and beings. 

(24) Therefore say ye further, in spiritual state and 
offices: If | or another preach for the sake of a good, fat 
ministry, otherwise | might well leave it standing, | might 
well preach the gospel; but my heart is not pure, but a 
filthy thing. Therefore, even if | preach for a long time, 
and say that it is a good work and a good ministry, 2c. | 
do not understand it myself, because it does not come 
from the heart. But the heart is righteous when it stands 
thus: | may have food for it, but | do not remain in it, but 
because God has called me to the ministry and 
commanded me to carry it out faithfully and diligently for 
His praise and the salvation of souls, | do it gladly from 
the heart for the sake of the word; | do not seek love, 
friendship, honor, or thanksgiving from men, but let it 
come out of my heart, and perform it before it receives 
honor, money, or favor, though | may have and take it 
without sin when it comes and follows. 

(25) Behold, the word is the cause, foundation, 
ground, spring, and fountain of the love of the heart, and 
of all good works, if they are to please God: for he may 
not be, if the heart be not first pure; for neither is it 
acceptable in the sight of men, if a man do a work without 
the heart, out of pure hypocrisy. Since now also Caesar 
and men demand the heart, even though they cannot see 
it, how much more must such a heart be before God, 
which does everything for the sake of the word? For this 
reason he also preaches that we are to be guided by it in 
all our life and deeds, and that we are not to let any thing 
hinder or challenge us, make us soft or weary, even if we 
suffer harm, ingratitude, contempt, etc. because of it, but 
that we go through it fresh and speak: | have not begun 
it for man's sake, neither have | left it, but for God's sake 
| will do it; let the other remain where it may. Then fine 





897 


W. IX, 540-543. 


People out, lords, princes, subjects, preachers 2c., sent 
to all good works, serving and pleasing GOD with 
pleasure and love; for the spring and fountain is good, 
not drawn from without, nor brought in. 

26 Let this be said briefly of the first part, how the 
heart becomes pure through the word alone, and not, as 
the monks dream, that one beats oneself with evil or 
impure thoughts, and makes other thoughts. For, 
thoughts be it, thoughts be it, the heart remains unclean 
where God's word is not in it, even if they pretend to have 
a great appearance of godly life, as St. Paul himself says 
of them. But this purity, of which he speaks, goes further 
than that outward, bodily purity, as the Jewish saints led, 
with much washing, bathing, food and drink, and our 
clergy with their fasting, clothing, orders 2c., but is called 
a purity of the spirit, that one may know from God's word 
how one should serve Him in all states. 


And of good conscience. 


27) Now follows the other part: "Of a good 
conscience", that love should go out of such a heart that 
has a happy, sure conscience, both towards men and 
God, towards people, as St. Paul praises 1 Cor. 9, 2. 27. 
that he lived in such a way that he neither offended nor 
grieved anyone, nor gave evil examples, but all who saw 
and heard him must testify that he served, helped, 
counseled and did good to everyone. Moses also boasts 
of such a conscience against his rebellious mobs, Deut. 
16:15: "I have never taken an ass from them, nor have | 
ever harmed any of them"; item Jer. 18:20: "Remember, 
O Lord, that | have always prayed for them, and have 
spoken their good before thee, and have turned thy wrath 
from them" 2c. Likewise also Samuel 1 Sam. 12, 2. 3:"l 
have gone before you from my youth even unto this day. 
Behold, here | am, answer against me before the LORD, 
whether | have taken any man's ox or ass, whether | have 
done any man violence and wrong, whether | have 
oppressed any man, whether | have taken any man's gift 
secretly" 2c. Behold, such glory and defiance shall every 
Christian also have, that he may so live against every- 


898 Erl. (2.) 18, 287-289. interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. |X, 543-546. 


899 





and practice and prove his love, so that no one may bring 
a charge against him to frighten his conscience or make 
him despondent, but that everyone must say, if he wants 
to confess rightly, that he has kept himself in such a way 
that vain improvement has resulted from it, who has 
wanted to accept it, and can boast of this before God 
against everyone. This means "a good conscience" 
before the people, or against the people. 

28. Although such a conscience does not stand 
before God's judgment, nor does that purity of heart in 
outward life or works of love (because we still remain 
sinners before God), yet we should have such a heart 
that we can comfort ourselves before Him and say: "God 
has commanded and commanded this, therefore | do it 
out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and would 
not gladly do otherwise, nor be too close to anyone and 
offend; but what | speak and do is ordered and 
commanded to me by God. A Christian must not allow 
himself to be deprived of such defiance, so that he can 
boast and refer to God's word against all the world. For 
anyone who does not respect this, how he leads his life, 
so that he can shut everyone up, and answer for it before 
people and prove that it is well lived, spoken or done, is 
not yet a Christian and has neither a pure heart nor love 
in him. For to rely on the doctrine of faith in such a way 
that, if one has it, 1) he may do according to it what 
anyone desires and loves, giving it to God, be it the 
neighbor's harm or piety, is not suitable in any way; 
otherwise the doctrine would have the name that it gives 
leave to any man's willfulness and evil; but it is said, 
"Love from a pure heart and a good conscience," 1 Tim. 
1:5, so that no one can reproach him, nor accuse him of 
anything evil and move him up. 

29 Whether this is still preached of our life and deeds, 
and a Christian is a different man before God, as we 
shall hear; but he must also take care that he is 
blameless before the world, and if he does not do 
enough in this, that he put the Lord's Prayer between 
them, and say both to God. 


1) Thus the Wittenbergers. Jenaer and Erlanger: the same. 





and people: "Forgive us our trespasses, as we also 
forgive" 2c. And so let life remain blameless before men, 
and keep a good conscience; if not by perfect love and 
purity of heart, yet by humility, that he may desire and 
ask forgiveness of any where he has not done, or cannot 
do, pure and perfect enough; that thy neighbor may say: 
Well, whether thou hast offended me, or hast not served 
me sufficiently, as thou oughtest: yet, because thou art 
so humble before me, | will gladly forgive thee, and give 
thee credit for it, as | am guilty, and would have thee do 
it to me again; for the sake of humility | must say that 
thou art a pious man, because thou standest not on thy 
head, that thou wouldest wantonly do against me, but 
turnest to love. That is why it is called blameless, 
because it is covered up by humility, and what was 
blameworthy is made right again, so that one cannot 
complain about it. Thus the law is to be interpreted and 
preached, so that both love goes right toward everyone 
out of a pure heart for the sake of God, and the 
conscience stands before the world. This is what those 
useless launderers should do for their loose, lazy and 
cold talk. But that all this should be valid and stand 
before God, there is still another part to it, namely that 
which follows: 


And of uncolored faith. 


30 For as | have said, even though | have a good 
conscience before men and practice love from a pure 
heart, yet the old Adam, the sinful flesh and blood, is and 
remains in me, so that | am not entirely holy and pure, 
and as St. Paul says in Gal. 5:17: "The flesh lusts against 
the Spirit" 2c. And he himself Rom. 7, 23. says of him 
that he must lie in the field and fight with himself without 
ceasing, so that he cannot do the good that he would like 
to do. The spirit would gladly live pure and perfect 
according to God's word; but the flesh is there and 
resists and challenges us, so that we still seek our honor, 
avarice, good days, and become lazy, weary or tired in 
our position or service. 

(31) So there remains an eternal struggle and 
resistance in us, that always many impure things come 
along for the sake of the same half piece. 


900 en. (2.) i8, 289-291.Sermon on | Tim. 1, 5. 6. 7. 


W. ix, 546-548. 901 





of our person, and cannot be vain purity nor good 
conscience and full love, without what may be before 
men; but before God there is still much deficiency and 
faultiness in us, though it would be perfect before men 
of all things. As, although David can defy before men 
that no one may punish him, Ps. 26, and the holy 
prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah 2c. boast and are certain 
what they have done according to their divine office, that 
it is right and well done, because it is God's word and 
command, and they have practiced it with a pure heart 
and conscience, Jer. 18:20, nor can they defy God's 
judgment, but must say, "If it is right in your sight, no one 
has such a good conscience or a pure heart; he must be 
terrified by your judgment and repudiate it. For God has 
reserved for him the advantage that he has a cause and 
a claim to every saint, that no one is too holy for him 
whom he cannot justly condemn, worthy of 
condemnation. Therefore, even though both heart and 
conscience are pure and good before men, you must 
think that a pure heart and a good conscience are also 
pure before God, that he does not punish them, and that 
they are as safe before his judgment as before men. 

Now the third part must come, namely "faith"; this is 
the right main part and the highest commandment, 
which includes all the others: that we know, where love 
is not perfect, the heart is not pure enough, and the 
conscience is not satisfied, since he still finds to punish, 
since the world cannot punish, that faith must come, and 
such faith, which is not hypocrisy and mixed with 
confidence of its own holiness. For where this is not, the 
heart will not be pure before God, nor will the conscience 
stand when the sharp judgment and reckoning begins. 
Then the people will leave me in peace, so that | can 
defy them. | have served, preached, helped, governed 
and presided over them with all faithfulness; and 
whether | have done too much or too little, | am sorry, for 
| would gladly have done all that | should. With this | am 
safe and excused, that they have nothing more to 
demand and must erase the register. But here it is said: 
| shall, in short, be a pure 


have a good heart and a good conscience, so that he 
cannot blame me or condemn me. We do not find that 
with us, even though we have something to boast about 
before the world. Therefore | must have something else 
here to hold on to when it comes to the trains, and my 
stupid and frightened conscience must say: | have done 
what | could, but who knows how much and sometimes 
| have done too little; because | cannot see and notice 
everything, as also Ps. 19:13, 1) says: "Who can notice 
how often he fails? | have the word, Thou shalt live, love, 
and have a good conscience, which is pure and holy; but 
| cannot conclude that it is so in my heart, nor that | have 
such a pure and good conscience as the word requires. 

(33) For there is no one on earth who can say, "I Know 
that | have done everything and owe nothing to God," 
but even the most holy must say, "| have done what | 
could, but | have failed much more than | know. And so 
our own conscience stands against us all, accusing us 
and making us unclean, even though we have existed or 
still exist in the best possible way before the world. For 
it must judge and pass judgment according to the word, 
which saith, Thou oughtest to have done this, or not to 
have done this. It cannot pass by it, nor answer it, and 
must at least be in doubt. But if it doubts, it is already 
unclean, for it does not stand before God, but wriggles 
and flees. Therefore, the main point of our doctrine must 
come to our aid, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ, sent 
into the world by the Father, suffered and died for us, 
and thereby reconciled the Father and brought him to 
grace, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, and 
takes care of us as our Savior, and as our constant 
mediator and intercessor speaks the best for us, as 
those who cannot have nor bring about such perfect 
purity and good conscience, so that through him we may 
say before God, "Whether | am not pure.

nor have a good conscience, | cling to him who has 
perfect purity and a good conscience, and who sets 
them up for me, even gives them to me. For he alone of 
whom it is written (as St. Peter [1 Ep. 2, 22.] draws from 
Isaiah Cap. 53, 9.): "He has done no sin, nor spoken a 
false word," and performs the rhyme with all honor, so 
that he has no need of the piece in the Lord's Prayer: 
"Forgive us our trespasses," nor of the article in faith: "I 
believe forgiveness of sins," 2c., but is free and secure, 
in eternal, pure, full righteousness and purity, whom no 
one can accuse, nor blame his conscience, neither man 
nor devil, nor God Himself; for He is also God Himself, 
who cannot blame Himself. 

34 This is called "the faith that is not colored” nor 
hypocrisy, but may stand before God in such a struggle 
and wriggling of the conscience and say: Dear Lord, 
before the world | am innocent and safe, that it cannot 
punish me nor bring me before the judge. For though | 
have not done all things, yet | desire of every man that 
he forgive me for God's sake, as | also forgive every 
man. With this | have satisfied her that she has no more 
right against me. But before thee | must, verily, put down 
my feathers, and confess myself guilty of all things, and 
say, as David himself Psalm 143:2: "O Lord, enter not 
into judgment with thy servant, for before thee there is 
no man righteous upon the earth." Therefore | cannot 
deal with you if it is to be right, but will appeal straightway 
and call me from your judgment seat to your mercy seat. 
Before the judgment seat of the world | let it happen 1) 
that one deals with me about the right, there | want to 
answer and do what | should; but before you | do not 
want to know the right, but crawl to the cross and ask for 
mercy, and take what | can. 

35 For thus the Scripture teaches me that God has 
placed two seats for man: a judgment seat for those who 
are still secure and proud, and do not want to recognize 
or confess their sin; and a mercy seat for the poor stupid 
consciences who feel and confess their sin, despair 
before His judgment, and gladly confess their sin. 


1) Erlanger: me. 


grace. This mercy seat is Christ Himself, says St. Paul 
in Romans 3:25, whom God has provided for us so that 
we may have recourse to it when we cannot stand before 
God by ourselves. | will also take refuge where | have 
done too little or am still doing too little, and much more 
in sin according to the law, both before my holiness and 
righteousness and afterward. 2) Let my heart and 
conscience, God grant, be as pure and good as it is or 
can be before men, all nothing, and briefly covered, and 
over it a vault, yes, a beautiful heaven, that mightily 
protects and defends it, which is called grace and 
forgiveness of sins; under it my heart and conscience 
shall creep, and remain safe. 

For thus he himself by his apostles preached and 
cried out, Acts 10:43, that in his name every one should 
have remission of sins. 10, 43, that in His name 
everyone who believes should have forgiveness of sins; 
item Marc. 16, 16: "Whoever believes and is baptized 
will be saved"; and He Himself, Joh. 3, 16, says: "God 
so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that 
whoever believes in Him should not perish but have 
eternal life" 2c. Thus, God Himself has set the mercy 
seat, and directs us from the judgment seat to it. Let the 
others come before the judgment seat as the trustworthy 
saints, despisers and persecutors of God's word, and 
they will hear their judgment. Let them remain in their 
circle until they also humble themselves. We, however, 
do not want to remain in the circle, but step out, as far 
as we can, into the free circle and place where the chair 
of grace stands, and appeal to it with every right, 
because we did not think it up out of our own heads, but 
it is His own word, and a strictly terrible judgment is in 
store for those who come with their holiness, as if to 
stand before God, and do not respect the chair of grace 
of Christ. For the judgment is already decided that they 
must come before the judgment seat; as Christ says Jn 
3:18: "He who does not believe is already judged, 
because he does not believe in the name of God. 


2) Instead of this reading, which is confirmed by the Latin 
translation, the Wittenberg and Jena translations offer: "or still do, and 
on earth do not let me drive away at all, be it sin, death, hell or the 
devil's terror. 

3) "a" is missing in the Erlanger.

of the only begotten Son of God. But he that believeth on 
him shall not be judged," that is, he shall not come before 
the judgment seat, but before the mercy seat, where 
there shall be no wrath, but shall be called the dear child, 
and all things forgiven that are not clean in him; yea, all 
things blotted out, as a drop of water from the hot sun. 
For where the mercy seat reigns, there is nothing but 
forgiveness and remission of all sins. 

37 Therefore we must learn to distinguish between 
the two things called the law and the gospel, which we 
teach at all times. The law brings us before the judgment 
seat, for it requires us to be godly and to love with a pure 
heart and a good conscience. This is what it is for, that 
we practice it; it should go so far and turn around. But 
when it comes and tells you to calculate and give what it 
wants, then it will be lifted up. For though thou hast done 
it, yet it shall not stand before God: for there shall be 
many things lacking and wanting before him, which thou 
hast not done, neither knowest thyself. Where do you 
want to go? The law drives you out and accuses you 
through your own conscience, which testifies against 
you, and demands a bad judgment against you. Then 
you must despair, and there is no help nor counsel for 
you, if you do not know how to flee from the judgment 
seat to the mercy seat. As when a bishop (who has been 
pious and lived well) dies in his holiness, and knows 
Christ no other than a severe judge, as he has been 
preached and modeled until now; as he is such, not 
because of him (for he is truly nothing but vain grace and 
consolation), but because they have not had or felt him 
otherwise in their hearts: Behold, he hindereth and 
hindereth himself, that he cannot come to any grace, and 
there is none to help him, because of his subtle 
ignorance, that he knoweth no difference between the 
judgment seat and the mercy seat, yea, knoweth not the 
mercy seat at all, and therefore must be without and 
abide under the judgment seat. 

038 But we teach that he is to be known and regarded 
as the one who sits for the poor, stupid consciences that 
believe in him, not as a judge who will condemn and 
punish, but as a gracious, kind, and comforting mediator 
between my Lord and my Son. 





905 


and God, 1 Tim. 2:5, saying to me, "If you are a sinner 
and afraid, and the devil wants to drag you before the 
judgment seat by the law, come and have yourself 
before me, and do not be afraid of wrath. Why? For | sit 
here, if thou believest in me, to stand between thee and 
God, that neither wrath nor displeasure may befall thee. 
For if wrath and punishment is to come upon you, it must 
first come upon myself; but that is impossible. For he is 
the dear child in whom all grace dwells, so that when the 
Father looks at him, everything must be love and favor 
in heaven and earth, and all wrath must be extinguished 
and gone; and what he desires and wants only from the 
Father, that must all be yes, without any doubt or 
contradiction. 

(39) So by faith we become completely blessed and 
sure that we shall remain uncondemned, not for the sake 
of our holiness or purity, but for the sake of Christ, 
because by such faith we hold on to Him as our mercy 
seat, certain that in Him and with Him no wrath can 
abide, but only love, mercy and forgiveness (2c). Thus 
in the sight of God the heart becomes pure, and the 
conscience good and sure; not considering my own 
purity or life before the world, but considering the dear 
treasure which my heart grasps, which is my pledge and 
fullness, where | cannot pay God, and have lack. 

(40) Now here is the power to see that faith is not 
false, or, as Paul says, dyed, but righteous in heart. For 
where this is lacking or deceptive, everything is lacking. 
For there have always been many, both now and in the 
past, who have much to say about faith, and who want 
to be masters not only of the law but also of the gospel, 
and who also say, as we do: Faith does it well, but the 
law and good works must also be added, otherwise faith 
is not valid; and so they mix our lives and deeds and 
Christ among themselves. This does not mean that faith 
is taught purely and unadulterated, but that faith is 
colored, distorted and counterfeited, so that it is not faith, 
but a false appearance and color of faith, because the 
confidence of the heart does not stand purely on Christ 
as the one and only seat of grace, but rather on Christ. 


906 Erl. (2.) 18, 2S5-2S8. Interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. 


W. IX, SS3-SS6. 907 





The faith is not placed on our holiness, but to stand 
before the judgment seat, so that it is also condemned 
before God and rejected where it belongs. For if faith is 
to be pure, unadulterated and uncolored, then the two 
must be separated, Christ and my work. For everyone 
must understand that Christ and his work is not my work 
and life, but something separate from the law and the 
life of all men, and much more than one man from 
another. For | cannot say that | and the emperor, or the 
pope of Rome, are one thing: nor am | much nearer and 
more equal to him (than one mortal, sinful man to 
another), 2) than to the Lord Christ, who is not only a 
pure, holy man, without all sin, but is also the one God 
Himself. 

(41) Therefore leave only the law, and thy pure heart, 
and good conscience, against men here on earth; but 
when the mercy seat is at the right hand of the Father, 
and is the mediator between thee and God, there shall 
no man's work or merit come to pass, neither shall it 
count for anything. For what have | or any man done to 
make him sit at the right hand of the Father? He is 
seated there without all my works and thoughts, and 
without all the 3) work of the law, for there is not a letter 
of it in the law. Therefore he must be purely separated 
from all my being, life and deeds, and decided that he is 
something else, because our life is led out of a pure 
heart and a good conscience before men, as well as we 
always can. For if it comes before God, and | meet with 
it the judgment seat where the law points me, | am 
damned and lost. But Christ, as the mercy seat, and he 
who abides in him cannot be condemned nor 
condemned. 

42) So here is the judgment seat 4) together with the 
law and all my life on one side; there | remain and all the 
saints, and let it all be condemned and condemned in 
God's name; but my faith shall flee and be condemned 
in God's name.

jump far over to the other side, as a poor condemned 
man who confesses his sin, to the dear mercy seat, and 
hold on to him who is pure and has no sin, of which the 
Scripture says Rom. 9:33.He who believes in him shall 
not be put to shame," because he stands there and 
speaks the best for me, and in addition gives me all his 
purity and holiness, so that | may stand before God 
covered and adorned with it, and all wrath shall be taken 
away, and instead love and grace abound over me. See, 
so faith remains pure and unpainted, for it is not based 
and founded on myself or my deeds, so that God should 
be gracious to me; as false hypocritical faith does, which 
mixes together God's grace and my merit, even though 
it keeps the words of Christ, but still sets the heart's 
confidence on itself, so that it is only a painted color that 
cannot last. For in the end, when you believe that God 
will be merciful to you because you have lived this way, 
you must doubt and say, "Who knows how you did it? 
How can you be sure that nothing has been missed or 
lacking? So then the foundation falls, and goes away 
from under you like quicksand, and then faith lies low. 

43 Therefore it is called a colored or painted faith, by 
which the heart sees as through a painted glass, through 
which a thing appears red or blue (as the glass is), and 
yet is not so. So they believe that God is so minded that 
He looks at our work and merit, and paint Him according 
to their own thoughts and dream, which is false in itself, 
and so look at both God and everything they judge by it 
through a painted glass. But so you see him with pure 
and clear eyes, if you distinguish these two chairs well, 
that heaven (of grace and forgiveness, through the 
Mediator) may remain pure with its stars, where Christ 
reigns with his works, and the earth also with its trees 
and grass, where we belong and everything that is ours. 
Thither (I say) we must bring it, if we want to stand before 
God differently, with right, uncolored faith, so that we 
learn to peel and separate purely between ourselves or 
our life, and Christ or the mercy seat. But he who does 
not want this, but

908 Eri. (so i8, 2S8-3V0. sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 5. 6. 7. W. ix, 


If aman runs straight to the judgment seat with his head, 
he will also find it and crush his head. | have also been 
there, and have burned myself, that | may be glad to 
come to the mercy seat, and now | must say: | may have 
lived in the best possible way in the eyes of the people, 
but all that | have done or left behind remains there under 
the judgment seat, and go to it as God wills; But | know 
no other comfort, help or counsel for my salvation, 
except that Christ is my mercy seat, who has done no 
sin nor evil, and has both died for me and risen from the 
dead, sitting at the right hand of the Father, and takes 
me to himself under his shadow and protection, so that | 
have no doubt that through him | am safe from all wrath 
and terror in the sight of God. So faith remains pure and 
pure, because it does not model anything, does not seek 
defiance or comfort, without the Lord Christ alone. 

(44) Now he that can do these things is a true man. 
For all the others go about with vainly colored faith, 
boasting much of faith, but mixing it among themselves, 
as cretins mix water with wine, so that they say, "If you 
live like this, God will be gracious to you," and make the 
mercy seat into the judgment seat; and again, as the 
judgment seat should become a mercy seat. But nothing 
will come of it, because it will remain a chair of justice 2c. 
Therefore only set the two far apart, as far as you always 
can, so that neither comes to the other: your life and 
holiness and chair of justice in a place that urges you 
and drives you to have a good conscience and to live 
rightly toward men; but your sin before the chair of grace 
on the other side, where God wants to receive you kindly 
and take you in his arms as a dear child, with your sins 
and stupid conscience, and no longer wants to know of 
any wrath. 

(45) Behold, if one thus preached of faith, man would 
be right in it, and do all these things afterwards, pure in 
heart and good in conscience, through right perfect love. 
For he who by faith is sure in his heart that he has a 
gracious God who is not angry with him, even if he 
deserves wrath, goes there and does everything 
cheerfully, and can also live like this toward people, 
loving everyone and doing good, even if they do not 
know the truth. 





are worthy of love. He stands before God in such a way 
that he is sure for the sake of Christ, the mediator, that 
he will not cast him into hell, but will smile kindly upon 
him and open heaven to him. 1) This is the highest 
security, the head and ground of our blessedness. Then 
| go out to my neighbor with my life, and do him the best 
| can, which my office or position demands and means; 
and if | do too little, | come first, and ask that he forgive 
me. 2) This is the highest security, the chief and ground 
of our blessedness. So | have a clear conscience, both 
before God and men, that neither he nor the world can 
punish me hereafter, nor hell devour me, nor the devil 
devour me. Thus man is called perfect in all things 
toward men through love, but before God, not through 
law, but through Christ, whom he grasps in his faith as 
the mercy seat, who sets up his holiness for me and 
gives me that in him | may have what is necessary for 
my salvation. 

46 This is the right, pure doctrine that should be 
practiced, and people should be taught in such a 
different way that they both stand before God and 
people, so that they do not throw one another and mix 
faith and love, or life against God and against people. 
This is what those glorified preachers should do, 
because they want to be reproached as masters of the 
law, so that such things would be well known and 
preserved in Christendom. 

For though it be carried to the utmost, it is hard 
enough to learn it well, especially we, who are so 
accustomed and educated in the doctrine of works, and 
who are directed only to the law and to ourselves. And 
without this our nature, which is of itself inclined to it, and 
is ingrained and strengthened by habit, and the heart so 
strongly set in pregnancy, beats us, that we cannot leave 
it, nor think otherwise than: If | had lived so holy, done 
so great and many works, God would be gracious to me. 
So that we both have to fight against our nature and 
strong habit, so that it is difficult for us to change our 
mind.

But the dung always clings and sticks to us, whether we 
are already in the faith, so that the heart always wants 
to boast before God and say: | have nevertheless 
preached so long, lived so well, done so much, he will 
see that; and we would like to make a bargain with him 
that he should see our life and make his chair of justice 
a chair of grace for our sake. But nothing comes of it. 
You may boast about this to the people: | have done the 
best for everyone, and where something is lacking, | will 
gladly do it. But if you want to come before God, just 
leave such boasting at home, and think that you are 
appealing to grace by right. 

If anyone wants to try this, he will see and experience 
how exquisitely difficult and sour it is for a man who has 
spent his life in his own work to come out and rise up 
with all his heart through faith in this one mediator. | have 
now preached and practiced it myself for almost twenty 
years, with reading and writing, so that | should be able 
to come out of it; yet | still feel the old anklebian 
nonsense, that | would like to deal with God in such a 
way, and bring something with me, so that he would 
have to give me his grace for my holiness,’ and | do not 
want to think that | should surrender so completely to the 
mere grace; and yet it should and must not be otherwise: 
the 1) mercy seat must apply and remain alone, because 
he has set it himself, or no man shall come before God. 

49 Therefore it is no wonder that it is difficult for others 
to grasp the faith so purely, especially when the same 
devil preachers, of whom St. Paul says, cry out against 
it and push on the law by such sayings, Luc. 10, 28: "Do 
this and you will live", item Matth. 19, 17: "If you want to 
enter into life, keep the commandments" 2c. Which is 
right and true, if thou understand it aright; the right 
understanding thou shalt tell me, or else | should know 
beforehand that | ought to be godly, and to keep the 
commandments: but how come |? Or what does it mean 
to be righteous? Do you say: It is to have a good 
conscience, a pure heart, and to do all that God 
commands.

has offered. Is right; but give me the same, or show me 
one who can say such. You will not be able to muster 
the heart or conscience for me for a long time, so that 
God cannot punish or condemn. Now the law demands 
(as has been said enough) such a heart that has a good 
conscience before God. Where does one get this? That 
is the question and the matter we are dealing with. Not, 
of course, from preaching the judgment seat, but from 
having pure, untainted faith that takes hold of Christ, and 
in Him has and gets everything that the law demands. 
Then everything is pure, and has a good conscience, 
and is called pious and righteous before God. For 
though | lack, he stands for me, and has so much piety 
that he can meet my lack and that of all men. 

(50) Thus we show how one comes to be pious 
before God, but they alone before men, where they do 
otherwise so well; and yet want to draw up the same, as 
if it should be before God. Brew it so into a pulp, as they 
know nothing of it, nor have experienced what they say 
or put. For what is it that you cry much: Whoever wants 
to go to heaven must keep the commandments 2c.? 
Thou wilt not be able to do it. For behold thyself, and 
search thine own bosom, and thou shalt find that thou 
art born and livest in sins, and art not able to give that 
which the law requireth. Why do you open people's 
mouths with such words: "You shall be pious, and you 
will be saved," from which nothing follows, and you do 
not show anyone how he should get there? | hear the 
words of what the law requires, but how do | make it so? 
Then you point me out again and say, "You must do 
good works. But how can | stand before God, when | 
have long done good works, and am pious before men, 
as thou teachest me, that | may be sure that God will 
count me so? For my own heart and conscience are 
against me, and say no to this. 

(51) But you should teach me, as St. Paul does here 
and everywhere, that it must spring from mere unfeigned 
faith to obtain the mercy seat first of all, and to take and 
add to it what we lack, so the saying is, "Keep the faith. 


912 En. (2) 18, 302-304. Sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 5. 6.7. W. IX, 561-563. 


913 





understood correctly. For this is what the law wants, that 
you be completely pious, both before God and before 
people. If you have this, then go out among the people 
and practice love and do good works; in this way you will 
get to the point and fulfill all such sayings. For by this a 
man gives and does what the law requires. First of all 
before God, not by himself, but through Christ, without 
whom we can do nothing before God; then also by 
himself before men. And now he is completely pious, 
inwardly through faith or Christ, then outwardly through 
his deeds. But that in addition to this, forgiveness of sin 
also goes among themselves. So that the righteousness 
of Christians is much more in forgiveness than in their 
own deeds; which those loose washers turn back, and 
without forgiveness alone do to our deeds. 

52 Thus St. Paul punishes the error and lack of 
understanding of those who praise and practice the law, 
and yet do not themselves understand or show how it 
should be done, nor how it should be accomplished; they 
can do no more than speak the words: Laws, keep 
commandments, be saved, do good works 2c. Just as 
they now smear all the books and spout all the churches 
with such useless rubbish, which they themselves do not 
understand, but never say a word about the fact that St. 
Paul teaches here as the main thing, how love should 
proceed from a pure heart, a good conscience and 
uncolored faith, they say no more than: "Keep the 
commandments", but never meet the same opinion. 

(53) Therefore they make it all unrighteous and false, 
both love, heart and conscience; for the main source is 
not there, that is, uncolored faith. But where this is not 
righteous, everything that is to grow out of it must be 
false, and what they pretend to be, a mere ghost and 
whispering before the eyes, seen through a painted 
glass, which seems to be of the same color, and yet is 
not; thinking that God should also look at it, because 
they lived like this before the people. 


1) Erlanger: "den Christum" instead of: durch Christum. 





as they consider it according to their blind conceit. If this 
were his opinion, he would have kept Christ and the 
whole preaching of the gospel with him; what was he 
concerned about, 2) that he created such a being, sent 
his Son down from heaven, and had his precious blood 
shed to earn and give that which we ourselves have with 
us before? He would have to be a fool to spend such 
treasure on it, which no one needs. 

So you see how they teach only their own dreams, of 
which they themselves neither know nor have 
experienced, and thus only mislead the people, because 
they cannot show how one must come to that, which they 
pretend, but only point to ourselves, and thus are 
strengthened in their old nature and habit, since they 
should lead the people out. These are indeed morose, 
hostile people, that St. Paul does not scold and rebuke 
them without cause. They must not have been bad 
people, because he himself says of them that they are 
called "masters of the law", and they want to be praised, 
and probably more and better than the apostles 
themselves. 

(55) Therefore let us keep this text, for it is quite fine 
and a pure, perfect teaching, how we both are to be 
pious before God and the world, as the law requires that 
these three things be brought together: namely, a pure 
heart, a good conscience, and untainted faith, and from 
which all our life flows and always goes in it. This is how 
we have met and aligned the opinion of the law. But first 
of all, that we look and bring Christ into it, who is the end 
of the law, and all things with one another, and all our 
godliness before God, which we do not find in ourselves, 
and without faith will never find, how long and how much 
one blows and practices the doctrine of the law, yet 
without understanding and knowledge. Let this be said 
of this text for the time being, so that we may have 
served God and paid a thank offering to the praise and 
glory of His grace, amen.

C. D. Martin Luther's Lection Wider die Rottengeister, und wie sich weltliche 
Obrigkeit halten soll. 


From the first epistle of St. Paul to Timothy Cap. 1, 18. 19. 20. and Cap. 2, 1. 2. *) 
Held Friday after Oculi, March 24, 1525. 


1 Tim. 1, 18. 19. 20. This commandment I 
command thee, my son Timothy, according to the 
foregoing prophecies concerning thee, that thou in the 
same exercise good chivalry through faith and a good 
conscience, which some have cast off, and have been 
shipwrecked in the faith; among whom are 
Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given to the 
devil, that they may be chastened to blaspheme no 
more. 

So far we have heard, 1) that St. Paul had to do 
everything to exhort Timothy to fight against the false 
teachers, so that he always had it on, that the people 
remain firm in the true, pure doctrine, and drive them on 
all the time. For the devil does not sleep, and makes 
every effort to deceive us; so the flesh is slippery, and 
does not remain steady and firm. Therefore it is 
necessary for the word to go forth continually, that the 
people may remain under the banner of the gospel in the 
controversy, and that they also may be raised up who fall 
and are challenged with false doctrine. 


According to the previous prophecies about you. 


2 | do not know what he means by this text; | do not 
understand it, because it is not almost clear. But it reads 
as if the Spirit had testified about Timotheum, as about 
Paulum, Apost. 13, 2. since he says, "Separate unto me 
Paulum and Barnabam." So the text reads as if he had 
been prophesied about. 


1) From these words "So far we have heard" Késtlin ("Martin 
Luther", Vol. I, p. 809 ali. p. 614, note 2) rightly concludes that Luther 
went through the First Epistle to Timothy coherently. 








that he should convert many and bring great benefit. But 
since there is nothing of this in the Scriptures, we cannot 
rely on it with certainty; therefore we let it go. For we must 
hold fast to that which is clearly expressed in the 
Scriptures. Or | hold thus, "According to the former 
prophecy," that is, according to the Scripture which Paul 
taught him. For the apostles have proved all things from 
the Scriptures, and so | will drive him into the Scriptures, 
that he may practice them, and that they may be a guide 
to him in all things. 


That you practice a good knighthood in it. 


(3) This is that thou be not slothful and desolate, and 
desist not, though many be displeased, and many false 
teachers dispute with thee. For a true preacher must be 
aman of valor, and a man of good courage, and a man 
that traveleth: he that will preside over others shall not 
sleep, because of the false prophets. The devil also does 
not sleep, he wakes him up; therefore he must watch, 
and stand as a man of war in armor, always waiting for 
the attacks. 

4 Here a Christian life is pictured, that it should be a 
war, Job 7:1, and those who have the word should go 
beforehand in the forefront of the army, have the sword 
in their fist, and draw the troops behind them, be 
prepared, and wait all the way for the blows, as in a real 
battle; otherwise we will soon be defeated. 

5. in a battle, one may not defend that no one perishes 
or is maimed, for the nature of war does not give it to-

handwritten collection of unprinted sermons by D. Martin Luther, first volume, first half, p. XXI. From the same index we see that Luther had 
already preached two sermons on Chapter | of the First Epistle to Timothy on March 17 and 18.

He who lies lies, if only the heap remains and keeps the 
field. So also, we have to dare a lot; and even though we 
have the word pure, their stings do not go off without 
damage. There never arose a false teacher who did not 
deceive people. The devil does not want to miss, he 
strikes down some with false teaching, which he mixes 
with pure teaching; he strikes some, that is certain, so 
well it cannot be kept. Now when flesh and blood fill it, 
and the poisonous doctrine enters the heart, the man is 
already slain and dead. Again, if | convert one with pure 
doctrine, | beat him from the devil and win him to Christ. 
Therefore we must strike into it, and pluck out some of 
the devil; we have a captain who triumphs in us, and 
keeps the field. 

This spiritual dispute must remain. For that the church 
should be governed without strife, without battle, in 
peace, as the pope thinks, that is not possible. But 
though the false prophets have the following, yet we are 
not under; because we have the word pure, we are 
undestroyed. Even if they deceive a lot, there is no power 
in it; the truth is still above, and beats the lie down, no 
matter how big it is; the truth is too powerful, and the lie 
is too weak and feeble. 

7 But that sects arise is right and must be so, Luc. 17, 
1. 1 Cor. 11, 19, otherwise | would not know that | had to 
be in conflict; we would also never come to the 
foundation of the Scriptures if we were not contested. 
Therefore he is also called a God of hosts, that is, a duke 
of hosts; he is everywhere in the field. Here, and in 
another place also, is all knighthood, strife, and contest 
with him, against the flesh and against the devil; 
therefore let us be good knights, valiant, waiting for the 
blows of the mobs. 


By faith and good conscience. 


(8) What faith and a good conscience are, you have now 
heard enough. God cannot suffer, even if you were 
Solomon and had all the art, that you should brave it. 
Paul does not want us to rely on our spiritual armor in 
battle, that is, on our art, which we have in the Scriptures, 





but on faith and a good conscience. For where it is not 
done in faith, it is lost. If the devil leads me into 
presumption, so that | think | am more learned than the 
other, and rely on my art, God is never there. And if the 
devil sees this, he proposes a vine, that a loose knave 
and a bad layman, who hardly knows two sayings in the 
Scriptures, may give thee. For you do it without faith, in 
presumption, thinking you know, and do not want to let 
God be Lord. You must despair of all art, must let God 
argue, and thus say: Lord, help; if you do not help, 
nothing helps; it is due to you, | am only the fist, the 
matter is yours; if you do not stop, | am soon overcome, 
if | had eaten all the Scriptures. 

9 So God is wonderful; he wants me to know the 
Scriptures and be mighty in them, otherwise | should not 
preach and yet not want to rely on them. Paul exhorts 
Timothy, 1 Ep. 4, 16, to study without ceasing; likewise 
Christ, that we should abound in the word, that we may 
smite the multitudes. He wants scholars to preach who 
are equipped in the Scriptures and can practice this 
knighthood, and yet they should not rely on their art and 
wisdom, but the Holy Spirit should drive them in faith: so 
the devil will be weakened. God will direct it, he will give 
us a mouth and wisdom, which not all the unrighteous 
shall contradict nor resist; therefore | shall also put it to 
God, and not to myself. There is also a great example of 
this in the Old Testament about Gideon, in the book of 
Judges Cap. 7, 2. ff., where God says to Gideon: "The 
people are too many that are with you; Israel wants to 
boast against me and say that they have done it. 
Therefore let the foolish and the timid return. Twenty-two 
thousand men went away, leaving only ten thousand to 
fight. Then said the LORD, The people are yet too many: 
them that fall on their knees to drink, let them go; but 
them that lick with the tongue like a dog, by them will | 
deliver you. 1) And of them 


1) Here in the text of the previous editions is erroneous: "those 
who lick with their tongue like a dog, let them go, but through them | 
will redeem you who fall on their knees to drink." 


918 en. 51, 310-31}. Interpretations on the | Epistle to Timothy. 


were only three hundred men; lest they should boast as 
if it had been done by their hand. 

010 But why doth he call them to have armor, 
because he would fight for them? It is a strange God; he 
will not do it without armor, nor by the armor; he wills that 
we bear swords, and yet will not rely upon them. So he 
also wants me to work, that | may feed myself, and yet 
he says he will feed me like the birds, without my work, 
Matth. 6, 26. Therefore we must send ourselves into it: 
He wants to have external things, and yet trust nothing 
in them. In this way we must also do to him here. He 
wants us to read the Bible carefully, and yet he wants us 
to work by his help. David says Psalm 44:7: "I will not 
trust in my bow, neither will my sword help me"; itemPs. 
147:10: "He delighteth not in the strength of the horse, 
neither taketh pleasure in any man's legs." Why do you 
deny, David? Do you say that you have no confidence in 
your armor? Why don't you hang it on the wall at home? 
Although David did not trust in it, he did not want to be 
without armor, for that would be tempting to GOD. God 
wants us to need and use it, so that we may keep the 
faith pure, and the world thinks it is natural, and by 
outward armor. 

(11) Therefore, whoever begins to argue, let him 
beware that he does not think he is the man who argues, 
but let God rule and stay under the captain Christ, who 
is too clever for the devil. But if you want to do it with your 
own art, and bring the Bible with you, the devil will blow 
it away, because he also knows the Bible. And if you are 
clever in the best possible way, God can take away your’ 
speech. Again, when the time comes, and God wants to 
use you for this, you will understand it very well, and God 
will give you mouth and wisdom. God takes you as a 
larva and fights in you in the same way as in a mummery. 
So it is not the larva that works, but he who is under it, 
and yet he must have the larva if he wants to make a 
mummery. Therefore, what | have is only a larva; Christ 
must work, and we desert idols and larvae with our art. 


919 


W. IX, 569-572. 


fine. If he does not fight through it, | am lost; and if | have 
Paul's and Mosi's art, the devil gives nothing to your 
larva. But if | have a cheerful heart toward Christ, faith 
and good conscience, let the devil trot here, he will not 
devour Christ. 


Which some have pushed away from themselves, 
and suffered shipwreck in the faith. 


(12) Now when the devil brings men to lead them into 
the presumption of their state, it is already lost; they 
stand in their defiance and cheat themselves in their 
prudence; they do not strike well, and are finely caught 
and slain with their own sword. Now we see the mad 
spirits fighting foolishly; in presumption they step up, 
have no good conscience, suffer shipwreck in the faith, 
and do nothing, because they want to do the thing alone 
with their intellect. 

(13) Now if presumption is dangerous in outward 
things, how much more in spiritual things? Pray to God 
that you do not presume on the Scriptures. God wants to 
have a humble, bruised spirit, and strong-minded on 
Christ, Isa. 66, 2. Ps. 51, 19. so they think they must 
deliver it, or it is lost. They should hand it over to God 
and command Him, throwing the keys at His feet and 
saying: "Lord, if you do not do it, it is not done; Lord, if 
you do not want to help, | will gladly be put to shame; the 
matter is not mine, therefore | will have no honor in it; | 
will gladly be your larva, only that you fight. The mobs 
cannot do that, they want to go straight through with their 
heads according to their reason, no one has told them to 
do so, they force their way in as if they are mad, as if 
God needs them and must have them, Jer. 23, 21. Ezek. 
13, 1. ff, therefore they have lost faith, Ezech. 22, 22. ff. 
Learn to recognize God and give everything to Him, and 
see that you hang on the head. 


Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander. 


14 There will have been many heretics; here he 
names only two of them. But what heresies they have 
had, | will leave undecided. If the devil seizes such a man 
who has been among us, and has the 


920 Erl. 5i, 312-315. sermon on 1 Tim. 1, 18. 19. 20. and 2, 


1. 2. W. ix, 572-574. 921 





Bible also, he is worse and more harmful than all the 
pagans who do not know the Scriptures. The Turk is not 
so to us as the pope and emperor; they are poisonous to 
us, their mouths are full of blasphemy, that they would 
have us fall to the ground with all shame. So too, the red 
spirits are more hostile to us than the pope; they 
blaspheme so much that it is beyond measure; the closer 
they are to us as friends, the worse they are to us as 
enemies. 

(15) These two were Christians; Paul might have 
taught them, and now they thought they had the 
Scriptures, and opposed Paul and his disciples. They 
were not bad fools, because they opposed Paul, but 
highly learned men, who must do it; they were not fools, 
who resisted such a great apostle, who preached so 
much, and did such great miraculous signs. It is a great 
presumption: they had in mind to put down what Paul had 
set up; that will have hurt him. He calls the Alexandrum 
afterwards in the 2nd epistle to Timothy Cap. 4, 14, a 
coppersmith, and says that he caused him much pain 
and resisted his words very much. It was not enough that 
he denied the gospel, but also caused him all other 
misfortunes. 

16 Now this is comforting in the fight against the 
hordes. What are we compared to Paul? Although we 
have the same spirit, we are not so rich in faith; we are 
weak and still far from it; and the excellent man should 
suffer from a coppersmith's resistance? These boys 
have always torn apart for him what he has built for a 
long time. 


Which I have delivered to the devil, that they may 
be chastened to blaspheme no more. 


(17) These two did battle in Saint Paul's army, slayed 
him and turned him away, and overthrew many a strong 
sermon, so that it hurt him mightily. It was also a great 
thing that he had to give up the apostolic office and hand 
it over to the devil. 1) Thus 


1) "surrendered" put by us instead of: "surrendered"; the latter may 
have come in here because this word is repeated immediately. That 
the reading given by us is correct is shown by the conclusion of s 18. 





we must now freshly surrender to it, so that it will also 
happen to us; it cannot be bad people who do such 
damage in Christianity. The devil does not arm himself 
with bad people, but with the most learned who have 
courage and a head, because he would like to prevail. 
He also does not attack the conflict in the strongest 
place, but invades where the loose people are. That is 
why God must preserve it. If God does not keep it, it is 
already over. But those who presume are already of the 
devil; he deals with them as he pleases. But Christ has 
a proud courage, is also presumptuous; he presses on 
and triumphs over the devil. 

18 When Paul saw that these two had thus corrupted 
Christianity, he was forced to punish them physically and 
gave them to the devil. But how he did it to him is not 
sufficiently expressed. Some think that he banished 
them; but it was too little and too bad, they would not 
have given anything to it. | think the devil will have 
possessed them and tortured them, that is where he 
gave them. But it did not help; the devil does not ask for 
such signs, which Paul did here. | did not want to have 
the grace to do miraculous signs, because those who do 
not turn to the word, against whom all the world cannot 
rebel, will not be moved by the signs. God does not give 
power to everyone, but only to the high spirits who know 
how to use it. For if anyone should have it, one would 
devour the other; you would give me to the devil, and | 
to you again. | do not mean that Paul condemned them; 
therefore | would like to understand that he let the devil 
torment them for a while, but not all the time, as he did 
in 1 Corinthians 5:5. But since it did not help, he let them 
go; that is then all the more given over to the devil. 


The other chapter. 


1Tim.2:1,2.1 exhort therefore that before all things we 
first make supplication, prayer, intercession, and 
thanksgiving for all men, for kings, and for all 
authorities, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life 
in all godliness and honorableness. 


922 Erl. Sl, 31S-317. Interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. IX, 574-576. 


923 





19 Now Paul, after admonishing Timothy to be 
diligent in his office, sets forth the order of how a right 
bishop should conduct himself. First, ask for secular 
authority. For this is the most necessary thing in the 
world, to have a strictly secular government. The world 
cannot be governed according to the gospel, for the 
word is too few and too narrow, it takes hold of few; the 
thousandth man does not accept it; therefore no outward 
government can be established. The Holy Spirit has a 
small group; the others are all harlots and knaves, who 
must have a worldly sword. Where the worldly regiment 
does not use its office strictly, then everyone tears to him 
in his sack; then follows riot, murder, wars, wife and 
children ravish, that no one wants to live safely. Mr. 
Omnes is not a Christian. King, princes and lords must 
use the sword, take away the heads. The punishment 
must remain, that the others may be kept in fear, and the 
pious may hear the gospel, and wait for their work, that 
everyone may be quiet and at rest. The apostles had 
great concern for the secular sword. 

20. it is also now very necessary that 





one would do a strong common prayer for the 
authorities, for we have neither king nor emperor who 
would be so diligent: the authorities are now lax and lazy, 
the superiors do not punish the subordinate lords, no 
rule, no prince is one with the other. From this arise so 
many outrages, and it is to be feared that God will one 
day mix us together and make a cake of us, so that we 
will swim in blood. Therefore we should ask that peace 
be preserved, that God would give the emperor so much 
mercy that he would keep the princes in check, the 
princes ruled the nobility and the cities, and immediately 
the overlords grabbed the heads of the underlords and 
visited them so that their rinds cracked. So with the 
Officials 2c., so peace would be maintained everywhere. 
It is a pitiful state of affairs that so much internal turmoil 
has now arisen everywhere. It belongs to us, who are 
Christians, that we earnestly beseech God that worldly 
authorities may rightly execute their offices. Prayer is 
great, but our God is also great, and He also wants to 
hear us. If the sword were severe and the government 
was right, it would be good to preach the gospel, but it 
will not help. Amen.

*This sermon was first printed in the first volume of Luther's writings published in Wittenberg in 1539, without indication of the time. In 
the Jena edition the year 1524 is given, likewise in the Altenburg edition. In the Leipzig edition, by an oversight (as stated in the preface to 
the 11th volume, p. 30), the year 1533 is set, which also happened in Walch, who (see his preface to the 9th volume, p. 16) followed the 
Leipzig edition. But because Luther preached on the First Epistle to Timothy continuously (compare the note to H 1 of the previous sermon), 
fo is to be assumed that he preached this sermon later than the previous one. This is confirmed by the second index to Luther's sermons 
found in Zwickau. Cf. Buchwald, Andreas Poach's handwritten collection of unprinted sermons by D. Martin Luther, first volume, first half, p.

against us, as they think, in the strongest possible way. 
Therefore, let us answer them and consider this saying 
rightly. 

(2) First, some say, "If it is true that God wills this, why 
does it not happen that everyone may be saved? If our 
will prevents it, then it must be stronger than God's will, 
so that what he wants does not have to happen if we do 
not want it to. Now he has ever said, Isa. 46, 10: "My 
counsel shall stand, and all my will shall be done"; item 
Rom. 9, 19: "Who can resist his will?" Thus he also 
proves manifoldly that he may awaken the whole world 
to set itself against his will, that one may see how his will 
must be done. How then does it rhyme that | should 
resist and prevent myself from being saved, since it is 
God's will? Therefore, it cannot ever follow from this that 
those say; otherwise it would have to conclude 1) 
without means that our will would be stronger than God's 
will. That is the first thing that strikes those back, that 
they cannot maintain their opinion with it, because he 
just with it fights hard against them, as strong as they 
want to lead him 2). 

(3) Secondly, the preceding text and the one that 
follows should give us the right understanding of these 
words. For it is not valid to take some words out of the 
Scriptures and make a waxen nose of them, according 
to our head, and not see what is attached to them, and 
what they urge. So we say, This is a common saying, 
such as is found more than Psalm 36:7: "O Lord, thou 
helpest both man and beast"; that is to say, Therefore 
thy goodness is precious and valuable, rich and 
excellent, that thou helpest not only thy dear saints, but 
also all men, yea, all beasts. If a bird escapes from a 
rope, a sheep from a wolf, an ox from drowning in water, 
you have done all these things. Yea, saith he, still more, 
When the beasts call, God heareth their cry, Ps. 147:9: 
"Who giveth his food to the cattle, to the young ravens 
that call upon him." The young ravens have this way, 
when a man comes to them and attacks them, the old 
raven flies away from them and comes no more; then 
they must open their mouths.

2) "him", namely free will. 


Sermon on 1 Tim. 3, 4. 





W. IX, $78-S80. 925 


Heaven, so that God proves that he feeds and nourishes 
everything that lives there. Item, this also teaches Ps. 
107 through and through. There are some (v. 5) who 
hunger and thirst, who cry out to you, and you satisfy 
them; some [v. 4] in the wilderness, who know nowhere; 
some [v. 10] caught in bonds; some [v. 26, 28] in the 
water, and he helps them out of all distresses. Therefore 
he says continually [v. 8], "They shall give thanks unto 
the Lord for his goodness, and for the wonderful 
wonders which he doeth for the children of men." There 
he does not speak of the elect, but of all men, whom 
God helps out of all distress. 

4 Thus this saying is also spoken in the common, that 
God does not only help the saints, but everyone. That is 


why | have translated the words: Qui vult omnes 


homines salvos fieri: He who wants everyone to recover, 
or: "That all men may be helped. The same is often 


written in the Gospel: Salvum facere, that is, to recover 
or to be helped, not to be saved. So that it is not to be 
interpreted of that life alone or of eternal life, but is to 
spread around and embrace all kinds of help, both 
temporal and eternal, that he is the only Savior, through 
whom all are helped. Pious and wicked, men and 
animals. He wants them all to recover where they need 
help. 

5 In the same way he says in the 4th chapter, v. 10, 
of this epistle: "He is the Savior of all men, but especially 
of the faithful. There he interprets himself in the most 
inexplicable way. First, he speaks to the common: "He 
is a Savior of all men." Then he separates the faithful 
and the pious from all others. He helps all people, even 
the unbelievers and unchristians, but mostly the 
believers. Here you see clearly what his opinion is, that 
he speaks of the help, not only which God needs for 
salvation, but which concerns everyone, that is, of the 
common help, which holds in itself all the mercy and 
goodness of God, over the pious and the impious, 
temporally and eternally. That it is so much said: No one 
will be saved nor redeemed from some distress, 
sickness, poverty, hunger and sorrow, God help him. 3) 
That this saying is therefore an honor and praise. 


3) In the old editions: for God help him. 


926 Erl. Z1, 3is-3ZI. Interpretations on the 1st epistle to Timothy. W. IX, S80-S82. 


God, and to show how he is minded and mannered, 
namely, that he gladly helps everyone, even if he is evil 
and does not serve God. Such understanding is also 
enforced by the preceding text, when it says 1 Tim. 2, 1. 
ff. "| therefore exhort that before all things we make 
supplication, prayer, intercession and thanksgiving 2c., 
that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life, in all 
godliness and respectability (and gives this cause:), for 
such is good, and also acceptable in the sight of God 
our Savior, who desires that everyone should be saved", 
or "all men be helped” 2c. Leads thus the saying evenly 
on the quiet and calm being. So you see, if you hold it 
against the previous and following text, what he is 
talking about. 

(6) So it is rightly composed and rhymed, otherwise 
it would not be appropriate at all; and he concludes 
against them himself, because he thus says that God 
wants to have helped everyone by a fine government 
and a quiet life, especially the faithful, so that they may 
lead a godly life, and faith may increase and be 
strengthened through persecution. For where there is a 
disorderly, quiet regime, that one only wars and storms, 
there can be no good, nor can anyone come to preach 
or hear God's word. But in a quiet, calm regime, one can 
have room to preach and to confess and practice the 
faith. Then follows the cross and suffering, through 
which faith becomes strong and vigorous. For because 
human reason, prudence and power are opposed to the 
word of God, they are punished and rejected by Him as 
unfit to act in divine matters; in addition, because the 
devil is the prince of the world, they cannot suffer or hear 
the word of God, and they begin to persecute and torture 
those who preach or confess it, as happened in the 
Roman Empire under the emperors, when it was at its 
highest. Thus, God wants to help both the secular 
regime and its believers at the same time. 

7 Therefore it does not follow that God will make all 
men blessed, but that he wills as much as has been said. 
For when he commands to ask for peace, it is a sure 
sign that he wants to have peace; without where his 
wrath is, that he plagues the world; otherwise it is his will 
that he keeps everything as he has ordered and directed 
it. 


927 


power. How would it be possible, if God did not preserve 
it, to rule so many heads and wild people in one city? 
How soon would a mob be gathered against the 
authorities and they would be murdered. What are two 
or three against a whole city? Reason is far too weak 
here to sustain it, as he also lets us see at times. So it is 
rightly said: "God wants to help everyone", and so it 
goes. For he preserves the temporal government, even 
if one rebels and opposes it with his head. But especially 
he upholds the spiritual against all the world and the 
devil's power and raging, even if the Christians are 
strangled. Therefore, you must not make any distinction 
of God's will, but remains an eternal will to help the 
faithful and others with his gifts; which will also no one 
can hinder. Therefore, one should adhere to it and 
comply with it, 'as Paul teaches here, when he calls 
asking and giving thanks. 

So he wants to have both straight away: No one can 
resist his will; nor should one ask for it. As he also says 
in the Lord's Prayer, Matth. 6, 10: "Thy will be done"; 
otherwise his will must be done. But we ask that we 
submit ourselves to his will. For if we do not surrender 
to it and resist it, he will turn his will back and afflict us 
with war, rebellion and other calamities. So now his will 
is done when we break ours and give him home to rule 
and reign. Nothing will help if he does not help; he must 
and will do it alone. We are still going, and fall in with 
reason, do not see how he alone helps, think that if the 
blacksmith were not there, no horse would be helped. 
But tell me, who gives the blacksmith the art, luck and 
skill to do this? For that the same heals is his gift; 
otherwise no art would help. And to prove this, he often 
lacks all art and wisdom. Summa Summarum: The same 
God, by whose will all things are done, also wants all 
men to be helped, these otherwise, and the others 
likewise; as he takes care of everything that lives and 
sustains it by his help, one thanks him or does not thank 
him, pours out and scatters his goodness over the pious 
and the wicked. 


928 


Erl. 51, 321-325. 


And come to the knowledge of the truth. 


(9) The other part, however, which he attaches to the 
preceding common saying, namely, "And come to the 
knowledge of the truth," concerns only believers. So also, 
when he speaks, afterwards Cap. 4, 10: "He is the Savior 
of all men," he adds: "But especially of the faithful. In this 
way he means that he gives to all so that they may 
recover or be helped, but especially to some so that they 
may come to the knowledge of the truth; this is a special 
and the greatest part of his goodness. He helps all 
people, but the best help is when he lets someone come 
to the knowledge of the truth. Thus, in the common will of 
God, this is also understood and especially expressed as 
the most noble thing, for this help also serves and is 
directed to the end that some may come to the knowledge 
of the truth or of the Gospel; which would not happen if 
God did not help in worldly matters, so that the 
government and all things would be right and orderly and 
would prevail. 

Now this text is clear and easy, so that no obstacle 
remains. So answer those who want to confirm free will 
from this, when they themselves do not see what they are 
deceiving. That is why those who have interpreted it in 
this way have spoken of it most sharply: If anyone is 
helped, he alone helps; that is, he alone is the only helper, 
and no one else. Whoever gets something good, gets it 
from him. | do not dislike this kind of understanding, 
because it agrees with what | have said, and it goes 
straight against free will, so that it is not able to help it at 
all. And that it may be seen that the understanding which 
we have given is right, St. Paul himself draws it out in the 
following words and says: 


V. 5. For there is One God, and One Mediator 
between God and man, the man Jesus Christ. 


11. he wants all people to be healed or helped (he 
says). Why this? 


1) "mcht" is missing in the Wittenberg. The Jena one has thd 
marginal gloss: "Scheinet als Mangel hie das wértlin nicht". 





Sermon on 1 Tim. 2, 4. 


W. IX, 582-888. 929 


Therefore, "For there is One God" 2c. How does this 
follow or rhyme? Thus: He must help, for there is no one 
else who can help; because he alone is God, and no God 
but One, therefore, whoever is helped, be it what it may, 
in general, must be helped by and through him, or must 
perish. 

There is only one mediator between God and man, 
namely the man Jesus Christ. This is of special concern 
to the believers. As the foregoing is also common to One 
God, so He mixes together common goodness and the 
greatest part of goodness, as above. The common 
goodness affects all people, believers or unbelievers. 
The other only affects those 2) who believe. So he first of 
all draws it into God's goodness, and yet draws the piece 
especially on it, so that he helps the believers, above and 
apart from the common help. There is only One God, 
here is only One Mediator; where God is not, there is no 
help; where the Mediator is not, there is no knowledge of 
truth and godliness, for the Father will not see or hear 
anyone except through Christ His Son. 


V. 6. who gave himself for salvation for all. 


(13) There he expresses the part about how he is a 
mediator, that it is not about the common help, but the 
special part, so: that one is helped to come to God, so it 
happens to no one, but through the mediator. So it 
extends first to the general, where he calls no mediator; 
then to the particular, where the mediator is. And the fact 
that he says, "For all," is meant to be referred to the 
mediator alone, that is, that all who are saved and come 
to God are to be saved through the mediator alone, not 
that all people are saved because of him. As one is wont 
to speak in a common way in many examples. As when 
one says of a schoolmaster in a city, "He teaches them 
all in the city," that is, he alone is a teacher; whoever 
learns anything learns it from him. There are many such 
sayings in the Old and New Testaments 2c.

IX. Interpretation on the Epistle to Titus. 


D. Martin Luther's sermon on our blessed hope, 


about the saying of St. Paul Tit. 2, 13. *) 


Held at Kemberg, August 19, 1531. 


(1) We Christians are obligated to pay homage to our 
dear Lord God every day and to make our sacrifice, that 
is, to perform His holy word, publicly in church and at 
home in houses. Such worship is signified in the Old 
Testament by the morning sacrifice and the evening 
sacrifice. So that we also do our sacrifice today, let us 
take before us a saying from St. Paul, and hear what our 
dear Lord God teaches us through His apostle. 


Tit. 2, 13. We should wait for the blessed hope and 
appearance of the glory of the great God and our 


Savior Jesus Christ. 

So much is enough on this time. 

2 Shortly before this text, v. 12, Saint Paul taught, as 
your love has heard, what the preaching of the Gospel 
should create and work in us, namely, that it should 
instruct us and "discipline us to renounce ungodliness 
and worldly lusts, and to live chastely, righteously and 
godly in this world. For in the three pieces he grasps the 
Christian life and understands everything that a man 
should do and how he should behave towards himself, 
towards his neighbor and towards God. Towards 
himself, a Christian should conduct himself in such a 
way that he draws his own body well, is "chaste", 
moderate and sober, and 





not to lead a free, impudent, wild, unclean and disorderly 
life in eating, drinking, words, gestures and deeds. 
Towards his neighbor he shall behave in such a way that 
he lives "justly", does neither harm nor hurt anyone in 
body, goods, honor and everything that is his, but gives 
and does to everyone what is due to him. He is to 
conduct himself toward God in such a way that he lives 
"godly," that is, fears, loves, trusts, praises, honors and 
obeys God. These are all righteous, delicious, good 
works, commanded by God Himself in the first and 
second tablets of the Ten Commandments. And this is 
how our whole life should be as long as we are here. 

(3) After the apostle has thus defined the Christian 
life and indicated how a Christian's character and 
conduct should be, he adds a special part and 
admonishes us that in such a chaste, righteous and 
godly life (since we have renounced the world, its 
ungodly character and evil lusts) we should "wait for the 
blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great 
God". 2c. This means that the life of Christians should 
be directed so that they do not think about living on earth 
alone and remaining in this world (as sows and 
unreasonable animals do, who do not care or think 
about anything else than how they may live here on 
earth and fill their bellies), but should hope and wait for 
another, better life. A sow 


*This sermon, which Luther delivered on the occasion of a visit to N. Bartholomaus Bernhardt von Feldkirch, prepositus and pastor 
in Kemberg, on August 19, 1531, was prepared for printing by Andreas Poach, pastor of the Augustinians in Erfurt, "from [I. Georgen Roérers, 
blessed, written books" for printing, and had them printed in 1561 in Erfurt by Georg Naumann, "zu dem bunten Leuen, bei St. Paul". This 
edition is provided with an inscription to the "honorable, virtuous virgin Engel vom Hagen". "Datum Erfurt in Vigilia Martini 1560." In the 
collections it is found: in the Eisleben one, vol. Il, p. 136; in the Altenburg one, vol. V, p. 603; in the Leipzig one, vol. XI, p. 468 and in the 
Erlangen one, first edition, vol. 19, p. 328 and 2nd edition, vol. 18, p. 31. We give the text according to the second edition of the Erlanger, 
which brings the first printing; the same differs only by a few insignificant variants from that of the Eisleben edition.

and unreasonable animal has no hope of improvement; 
when the belly and this life cease, its comfort and hope 
are also over. But a Christian has one better hope, when 
this temporal, perishable life ends, that he will enter into 
an eternal, imperishable life and heavenly being, in 
which is joy and bliss. 

(4) For Christ did not come from heaven and become 
man for this reason, nor did he die for us on the cross for 
this reason, nor did he rise again from death and ascend 
to heaven for this reason, so that he would let us remain 
here on earth in misery and sorrow, much less under the 
earth in the grave and death, stink and worms, forever, 
but so that he would deliver us from all this and take us 
to his eternal kingdom in heaven. Neither were we 
baptized and made Christians for this reason, nor do we 
hear the gospel for this reason, that we should fill our 
faint, stinking belly and remain in this evil, sorrowful 
world forever, but that we should come into another life 
and being, where we are no longer allowed to eat, drink, 
have toil and labor, suffer, be sad, die and decay 2c. 
Since we have been bought by the precious blood of 
Christ, born again in holy baptism through His joyful 
resurrection from the dead, and called through the 
gospel to a living hope, to an inheritance that is 
imperishable, undefiled and unfading (as St. Peter says 
1 Peter 1:3, 4), which will be preserved for us in heaven, 
we should also hope and wait for this blessed hope with 
joy and confidence. 

(5) This Christian art and masterpiece is taught to us 
here by St. Paul, and he exhorts us Christians to learn 
to distinguish between this present, perishable life and 
that future, imperishable life, and to turn our backs on 
this present life, which is passing away and which we 
must finally leave behind, and to always set our eyes on 
that future life, hoping for it firmly and surely, as it 
remains forever, and into which we belong. We should 
wait in good works, in discipline, righteousness and 
godliness, he says, for the blessed hope; that is, we 
Christians should send ourselves to a better life than this 
life on earth is. We are to build on it much more firmly 
and hope for it more surely, whether we have already 
attained it. 


Sermon on Tit. 2, 13. 





933 


W. IX, 588-591. 


not yet see and feel, because we build and hope on this 
present life that we see and feel now. 

(6) Such things are rightly taught, but not soon 
learned; rightly preached, but not soon believed; well 
exhorted, but not easily followed; well said, but evil done. 
For there are very few people on earth who wait for the 
blessed hope, for the future, imperishable inheritance 
and kingdom, and wait for it as surely as it should be that 
they do not possess this present life so surely. Few are 
those who look at this temporal life only through a 
painted glass, and at once blinkingly, 1) but at that 
eternal life with clear, open eyes. The blessed hope and 
the heavenly inheritance are, alas, all too often 
forgotten; but the temporal life and the transitory 
kingdom on earth are all too often thought of. The 
transitory is always in sight, thought of, cared for, and 
rejoiced in, but the imperishable is turned away; the 
latter is pursued day and night, and the latter is cast to 
the winds. Now, truly, it should not be so with Christians, 
but the antithesis should be. A Christian should look at 
this temporal life only with closed eyes and blinkingly, 
but the future eternal life he should look at with 
completely open eyes, and with clear, bright light, and 
should be only with the left hand in this life, on earth, but 
with the right hand, and with the soul and whole heart, 
he should be in that life, in heaven, and wait for it in 
certain hope always cheerfully. 

For this is what St. Paul teaches in 1 Cor. 7:29, 30, 
31, when he explains what this means, "waiting for the 
blessed hope," and says: "Further, this is the opinion of 
those who have wives, that they are as though they had 
none; and those who weep, as though they wept not; 
and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and 
those who buy, as though they possessed not; and 
those who have need of this world, that they abuse not 
it; for the things of this world pass away." With these 
words, the dear apostle wanted us to understand this life 
on earth, which we now see with our physical eyes. 


1) Otherwise in Luther also (St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 1008): 
"blinzling", that is, blindlings, with closed eyes. In the Cisleben edition 
it is written "blindstich".

W. IX, 591-593. 





He would like to darken and obscure the life we see in 
heaven, so that we might learn to look at it only in the 
twinkling of an eye, as if it were not our true life. But that 
life in heaven, for which Christ has redeemed us, for 
which we have been baptized and have received the 
gospel, he would gladly draw out and bring into the light, 
so that we may learn to send our eyes, heart and soul to 
it, and await it with joy in fresh hope. For if we want to be 
Christians, our final request should not be to be free, to 
let ourselves be free, to buy, to sell, to plant, to build, as 
Christ says, Matth. 24, 37. ff. Luc. 17, 26. ff., that the 
ungodly will do, especially before the last day (although 
we also need it for the need of the body), but our final 
request should be something better and higher, namely 
the blessed inheritance in heaven, which does not pass 
away. Likewise he does 2 Cor. 5, 1. 2. and says: "We 
know, if our earthly house of this tabernacle is broken 
down, that we have a building constructed by God, a 
house not made with hands, which is eternal, in heaven. 
And above the same we also long for our habitation, 
which is from heaven." And soon after, v. 6, 7, 8: "We are 
always confident, and know that while we dwell in the 
body, we are not at home with the Lord;' for we walk by’ 
faith, and not by scraping. But we are confident, and 
rather desire to walk apart from the body, and to be at 
home with the Lord." There he also makes a distinction 
between this perishable and that imperishable life, and 
says that this life on earth is not our home and right life, 
on which we have to set our date 1) but should long for 
the right fatherland and have a desire for the eternal 
dwelling in heaven. And Phil. 3, 20. 21. he says: "Our 
citizenship is in heaven, from whence we also wait for the 
Savior Jesus Christ, the Lord, who will transfigure our vile’ 
body to be like His transfigured body, according to the 
working, that He may also make all things subject to Him. 
As if he wanted to say: It is not in this world that we 
Christians live, walk and dwell, but in heaven is our 


1) Date -- confidence, hope. 


Citizenship, walk and dwelling. We are indeed citizens 
and farmers on earth for a time, according to the outward 
worldly nature, but this is not our true, hereditary, lasting 
citizenship; but our true citizenship is with Christ in 
heaven, where we will remain citizens forever, when he 
comes from heaven and takes us up. Therefore we also 
ought to judge ourselves as not being of this world, nor 
belonging to it, but belonging elsewhere, to another 
citizenship and kingdom, where we have an abiding 
nature. 

8 St. Peter does the same when he says 1 Ep. 2, 11: 
"Dear brethren, | exhort you, as strangers and pilgrims, 
2) abstain from carnal pleasures. He calls us strangers 
and pilgrims, 2) indicating what our life is on earth and 
what we should keep it for. A "stranger" is called an arrival 
or alien, who is not a citizen of the place where he dwells, 
by arrival and birth, but has his arrival elsewhere. 
SumMa, a stranger is called, who is not native, as the 
children of Israel were strangers and not native in Egypt, 
where they had come from the land of Canaan, by the 
Theurung; as Moses often reproaches them and says, 2 
Mos. 22, 21. 3 Mos. 19, 34.: "You were strangers in the 
land of Egypt." A "pilgrim" is a wanderer who travels 
through a country, and is not in his city nor in his place, 
where he belongs, but only lodges in a foreign place, as 
if in transit; who is not only an arrival, like a stranger, but 
is also a guest, and has nothing of his own, nor intends 
to have anything in the place of his pilgrimage, but passes 
through badly. As the children of Israel were pilgrims in 
the wilderness, so the Christians are strangers and 
pilgrims in this world, 1 Petr. 2, 11. Hebr. 11, 13. They are 
"strangers" because they come from God into this world 
after the fleshly birth, created from nothing, and do not 
remain in this world, but have to leave this world, like all 
other people on earth, as Job Cap. 1, 21. says: "| came 
naked from my mother's womb, naked, naked and naked. 


2) Erlanger: "pilgrim". This form is derived from the Latin pers“rinus. 
Otherwise also "Bikgerin" and "Bilgram" are found.

Erl. (2.) 18, 38-40. 


Sermon On Tit. 2, 13.

| will go there again." They are "pilgrims" because after 
the spiritual birth, when they are born again of the Holy 
Spirit through the water bath in the Word, they are on 
earth as guests, and their life is only a pilgrimage, as the 
patriarch Jacob calls it, Gen. 47, 9. Now St. Peter wants 
to indicate that we should not look at this life differently, 
but as a stranger and pilgrim looks at the country, in 
which he is a foreigner and guest. A stranger must not 
say: Here is my fatherland, because he is not a native 
there. A pilgrim does not intend to stay in the land where 
he wanders and in the inn where he lies overnight, but 
his heart and thoughts are elsewhere. In the inn he takes 
only his food, meal and lodging, and always wanders 
away to the place where he is at home. So you 
Christians, he says, are only strangers and sojourners 
in this world, and belong to another country and 
kingdom, where you have a permanent home and 
abiding place forever. Therefore present yourselves as 
strangers and sojourners in this foreign land and inn, 
from which you take no more than food, drink, clothing, 
shoes, and whatever you need for this night's lodging, 
and think only of going away to your homeland, where 
you are citizens. 

(9) We should take good note of this, so that we may 
rightly know the Lord Jesus Christ, and rightly learn to 
enjoy his gospel and holy baptism. Not that we build an 
eternal life for ourselves here in this world, pursue it and 
Cling to it as if it were our main treasure and kingdom of 
heaven, and as if we wanted to enjoy the Lord Christ, 
the gospel and baptism for this life, and become rich and 
mighty in it, but because we must live on earth as long 
as God wills that we thus eat, drink, free, plant, build and 
house, and what God has provided, as strangers and 
sojourners in a foreign land and in an inn, who will 
remember all these things and set up their staff again, 
out of the foreign land and out of the evil, uncertain inn 
into the right fatherland, where there will be security, 
peace, tranquility and joy for eternity. And so we enjoy 
the Lord Christ, the gospel and baptism to that life in 
heaven and the kingdom of God. 





10. For our Lord Jesus Christ is not such a Messiah, 
as the Jews have desired and still desire and hope for a 
Messiah, who is a worldly king and establishes an 
earthly kingdom on earth, in which he makes his children 
great lords in this world, distributes gold, silver and 
goods, gives worldly joy and pleasure, but leaves them 
in death, and finally dies himself, together with them, like 
other kings on earth; but is an eternal king, and his 
kingdom is an eternal kingdom, in which he is Lord over 
sin and righteousness, over death and life, and gives 
and gives to his children heavenly goods, eternal 
righteousness, life and blessedness. So we are not 
baptized to stay here on earth and build a paradise and 
kingdom of heaven for ourselves here; nor is the gospel 
preached to us for the sake of this worldly being and life, 
but that heaven may be opened to us and we may be 
helped to eternal life. 

(11) As for this temporal life, how to attain and 
maintain it, this is taught by the temporal government, 
which God has subjected to man's reason by His Word, 
saying Genesis 1:28: "Rule over fish of the sea, and 
over fowl of the air, and over every living thing that 
creeps upon the earth. The emperor in the empire with 
his rulers and lawyers teaches how to govern land and 
people, maintain worldly peace 2c. Father and mother, 
master and wife in the house teach the children and the 
servants how they should build the field, plow, sow, 
plant, harvest, spin, sew, milk the cows, wash in the 
kitchen, cook, work, keep house 2c. For such human 
beings and things concerning this temporal life, there is 
no need of Christ, baptism, or the gospel, for all these 
things are planted in human reason, so that it 
understands and knows how to govern and judge such 
things. But Christ in his kingdom teaches us through the 
gospel of higher things, which belong to that life, and 
which human reason cannot comprehend nor grasp, 
namely, where we may remain when this bodily, 
perishable government and being cease, and we leave 
the world, and what is in the world, together with this life. 


938 Eli. (s.) i8, 40-42. interpretation on the Epistle to Titus. 


and have to step into another being and life. 

(12) He who does not direct and send his heart to that 
everlasting life, and only clings to this temporal, 
perishable life, does not understand what baptism, the 
gospel, Christ and faith are. For Christ calls us to eternal 
life through the gospel, and through baptism places us in 
his eternal kingdom, and thus assures us through Word 
and Sacrament that if we believe the word and sign, we 
are much more certain of the same life and kingdom than 
of this life and kingdom on earth. Whoever thinks that 
everything is only to do with living, eating and drinking, 
scratching and scratching, being stingy and collecting a 
lot of money, seeking pleasure and having good 
courage: what can he know or understand about 
baptism, the gospel, Christ and faith? 

(13) But, as | said, this is soon preached, but not 
easily believed. For even we Christians, who have been 
baptized, hear the gospel and have begun to believe, still 
feel that the spirit in us is weak, but flesh and blood and 
reason in particular are strong, and always draw us back, 
that we hold that life in low esteem, and sometimes even 
doubt it, so that where we want to confess otherwise, we 
must confess ourselves, we seldom think of the fact that 
we must finally leave it and this life, and thus send 
ourselves to know where we want to stay. On top of this 
comes the stupidity that we are always afraid of death, 
mourning and trembling when things go badly for us. 
This is a sign that we do not wait for the blessed hope, 
as we should. This is what happens to us Christians; but 
the rest of the great multitude in the world goes safely 
along, seeking peace and good days, seeking pleasure 
and joy on earth, drowned in avarice, and so engrossed 
in the world as if they wanted to stay here forever and 
leave heaven to God. 

(14) Now we are not baptized for this life, nor are we 
called Christians for this reason, that we may be citizens, 
peasants, masters, servants, wives, maids, govern and 
be governed, work and keep house; but for this purpose 
we were baptized, and for this purpose we hear the 
gospel and believe in Christ, that we may have the same 
status (whether we are here on earth already, as long as 
God wills), 


W- ix, S96-S99. 939 


and must serve God, each one as he is called by God) 
leave all, and depart from this world into another being 
and life, where there is neither servant nor master, 
neither maidservant nor wife, neither woman nor man, 
but where we are all alike and one in Christ Jesus, Gal. 
3:28, just as such equality begins here in faith, but is 
accomplished there in sight, 1 Cor. 15:53 ff, where there 
is no death, but eternal and incorruptible life; no sin, but 
righteousness and innocence; no fear nor sorrow, but 
security and joy; no dominion, nor authority, nor power, 
but only God will be all in all; summa, where God and 
Christ Himself is, together with all His elect and saints. 
To this eternal life we were baptized, to this Christ 
redeemed us by his death and blood, and to this we 
received the gospel. As soon as a child is lifted out of 
baptism and the vestment is put on it, it is from that 
moment on dedicated to eternal life, so that for the rest 
of its life it will only be a pilgrim and sojourner in this 
world, and so it will be prepared to leave this temporal 
life behind and hope and wait for that everlasting life. 

(15) Now St. Paul teaches us here that we should not 
sink too deeply into this temporal life, like sows and 
unreasonable animals, which care nothing about the life 
to come. A sow lies on her bed or on the dung heap, 
rests and snores, and thinks only where the miserable 
and the small are, knows of no death, fears no hell, 
rejoices in no heaven, hopes for no future life, but the 
miserable and the small are her heavenly kingdom. So 
are the people who think no further than how they may 
live here on earth. Such certainly do not believe that 
there is a resurrection of the dead and eternal life; even 
though they speak with their mouths in childlike faith, "I 
believe in a resurrection of the flesh and eternal life," 
they do not believe it from the heart. Such people have 
been baptized in vain, have heard the gospel in vain, and 
still hear it in vain and in vain, because they do not 
believe that it is true that after this life there is another 
life. 


940 Erl. (2.) 18, 42-44. 
to hope. Therefore the apostle says: "We should wait for 
the blessed hope", as if he wanted to say: We have come 
through the gospel to the treasure, which is called, not 
money and goods, not power and honor, not pleasure 
and joy of this world, not even this life on earth, but a 
hope, and a living "blessed hope", which will make us 
alive and blessed in body and soul, completely and 
forever. We are called to the treasure through the 
gospel, and we are baptized into the treasure; therefore 
let us deal with this temporal life in such a way that we 
think of leaving it behind us, and strive for the same 
blessed hope as "the goal and jewel set before us by the 
heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus", Phil. 3, 13, that 
we should chase after it and always wait for it. 

How long shall we wait for the blessed hope? Will it 
remain a hope forever, and nothing more come of it? No, 
he says, our blessed hope will not remain like this 
forever, but will finally appear, so that we will no longer 
be allowed to hope and wait, but it will be revealed to us 
what we now believe and hope for, and we will be fully 
granted 1) and possessed of what we are now waiting 
for. In the meantime, we must wait for the blessed hope 
until it comes to manifestation. But when it has come to 
the appearance, then the hope and the waiting will 
cease. For he puts these two together: "hope" and 
"appearance"; but in this order, that the hope precedes, 
and the appearance follows the hope. And thus he 
makes a distinction between this life of hope and that life 
of appearance; or as he calls it in the saying (as we 
introduced above [§7] from 2 Cor. 5, 6. ff.), between this 
life of faith and that life of seeing. As if he wanted to say: 
Here it must be believed, hoped for and waited for, but 
there it will appear. He who does not wait for the blessed 
hope will not come to the appearance; but he who is firm 
and undoubting

Sermon on Tit. 2, 13. 


941 


W.IX.S99-60I. 


who waits for it, must not take care of the appearance. 
He also makes such a distinction in Col. 3, 3. 4: "Your 
life is hidden with Christ in God. But when Christ, your 
life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also be 
manifested with him in glory." St. John also makes such 
a distinction, 1 Ep. 3, 2: "We are God's children, and it 
has not yet appeared that we are; but we know when it 
shall appear that we shall be like Him." Because we live 
here in this world, that future life is covered and hidden, 
and must be recognized and grasped with the eyes of 
faith alone. This present life is manifest to the five 
senses and to human reason, for it is visible, but that life 
is invisible; therefore it cannot be seen with the eyes of 
the flesh, nor measured by reason. 

But he says that it will be "a manifestation of the glory 
of the great God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ. There 
he does not only speak of the glory in which Jesus Christ 
will appear for his person and for himself, which will be 
an excellent glory, as he himself says Matth. 25, 31: 
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the 
holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his 
glory, and all nations will be gathered before him" 2c., 
but also to understand the glory that Jesus Christ will 
work in all creatures, and especially in His elect and 
believers, as He Himself interprets such glory in 2 
Thess. 1:10, when He says: "The Lord Jesus will come 
to appear glorious with His saints, and marvelous with 
all believers." 

This glory is so deeply hidden that no human reason 
can enter into it. It is far too high for reason to 
understand and comprehend that this mortal body 
should rot and stink so that no filth and carrion on earth 
stinks like it, and become powder and ashes, and be 
eaten by worms, and yet come forth again from the stink, 
dust and worms, and rise again, that it should be the 
same body, but brighter and clearer than the sun, so that 
no creature on earth will be more beautiful. What, 


942 Eni. (2.) 18, 44-46. interpretation on the Epistle to Titus. W. IX, 601-604. 


943 





says reason, should there be glory to wait for, when | 
see vile, abominable beings? | see that a man, if he is 
already baptized, has the gospel, believes in Christ, just 
as well dies and, if he has died, rots, stinks, as one who 
is not baptized nor believes, yes, becomes such an 
abominable carrion that no one can stay around him: 
what do you tell me much about glory? Yes, wait for it, 
and do not bake! So does reason, and cannot do 
otherwise. 

(19) Now it is not necessary to listen to reason, nor 
to follow what it says, but to listen to what baptism, the 
gospel and faith teach. Baptism teaches that we are not 
baptized for this life, but that we should wait for another 
life. The Gospel says 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, "that Christ died for 
our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was 
buried, and that he rose again the third day according to 
the Scriptures." V. 16, 17. "If therefore the dead rise not, 
neither would Christ be risen, and our faith be vain and 
false." Faith bases itself on this, saying, "Well, though a 
man die, and when he is dead, look hideous, and rot, 
and stink, and be eaten of worms, yet do | not turn to it, 
and give me nothing that reason saith concerning it. | 
have a light that goes far beyond all reason, namely 
baptism and the gospel; that same light thus tells me that 
God will make of this foul flesh and shameful, dead 
body, which now rots and stinks, in its time a beautiful, 
glorious flesh and a living, clear body, which is brighter 
than the sun and smells better than all balm. | have no 
doubt of this, although | see it much differently now 
before my eyes; for because God says such things in his 
word, he will also do them. So faith must firmly bind itself 
to the word, fight and contend against all reason. 

(20) And how could we expect reason to be more 
valid than God's word in these very matters concerning 
our salvation, and to judge and judge in God's works 
what it cannot comprehend with its five senses and 
sharp thoughts? God has done more and still does daily 
what reason cannot comprehend. He has created 
heaven 


and earth, sun, moon and all creatures were created 
from nothing. What was the sun, the beautiful, bright 
light that fills the whole world with its brilliance and glow, 
six thousand years ago? Nothing. Now all reason must 
confess that nothing, from which the sun was created, is 
much less than a filth and dead stinking carrion. If God 
created the sun from nothing, which is much less than a 
dead body, should he not have so much power and 
strength that he could raise a dead body and make it 
alive again? 

The grain is thrown into the field before our eyes and 
sown; now therefore ask all reason: What is the grain in 
winter that is sown in the field? Is it not a dead, rotten 
and decayed thing, covered with frost and snow? 
Nevertheless, in its time a fine, beautiful, green stalk 
grows out of the same dead, rotten and decayed grain, 
which therefore blossoms like a forest, and gains a full, 
thick ear, since twenty, thirty, sixty grains are in it, and 
life is found, where before there was only death. If God 
has done this to heaven, earth, sun and moon, and still 
does this yearly to the grain of the field, when he calls 
that which is nothing to be, and does this against all 
reason, should he not also be able to do what is for the 
glory of the children of God, even though it is against all 
reason? 

Therefore, we should not let our reason be misled 
here, for Christ has purchased this treasure for us 
through His blood, and we have been called to this glory 
through the Gospel, and have also been baptized as a 
sign and certain seal of it, and lack nothing but the 
appearance and revelation that God will remove the 
cover that still hangs over it, so that we may see face to 
face what we now see through a mirror (as St. Paul says 
in 1 Cor. 13:12) in the dark word. For this reason we are 
to reject all reason and long for it, and wait for it in firm 
faith and certain, constant hope, and pray to God that 
His kingdom may come soon, so that we may finally 
obtain the treasure to which we were baptized and for 
which we hear the gospel. 


944 Erl. (2.) 18, 46-48. 

2'3 St. Paul says rightly, 1 Cor. 15, 42. 43.: "It is sown 
corruptible, and will rise incorruptible. It is sown in 
dishonor, and will rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, 
and shall rise in power." He proves the glory that Christ 
will work on us through the resurrection with a similitude 
of sowing. When a farmer sows grain in the field, or a 
gardener puts beans or peas in the ground in the 
garden, he does not see the beans or peas decay, but 
looks at the stalks and pods that grow from them. He 
knows that the bean and the pea were also a stem and 
a pod before; therefore he puts it into the ground, so that 
it may again become a stem bearing pods. In the same 
way we should not think that our body, when it is dead 
and buried, will decay in the earth, but we should think 
that it will come out of the earth again and become alive. 
When the dead body is buried, it is sown decayed; not 
that it should lie eternally in the earth under decay, but 
that it should rise again from the earth incorruptible. He 
is sown in dishonor, shame and disgrace; for he stinks 
horribly, the worms eat him, the toads and snakes pierce 
his eyes, ears and nose, so that nothing remains but 
dead men's legs. There is nothing honest, nothing 
lovely, nothing glorious, but vile, stinking, foul creatures. 
But he shall rise in glory, that he may be glorious beyond 
measure, smelling better than any balm, and more 
beautiful than any creature. 

(24) Therefore, when we sit in the garden or walk in 
the field, let us exercise and strengthen ourselves in the 
article of our faith concerning the resurrection of the 
dead. A gardener sets cherry stones, a husbandman 
casts grain into the ground, and does not look at the 
stones he sets, nor at the grain he sows; otherwise he 
would well keep the stones and grain; but looks at the 
tree, and at the grain that shall grow out of it. His heart 
is so minded that he says, "Now | will plant the seeds, 
and in due time there will be a fine young tree that will 
bring forth the most beautiful cherries. Now | sow the 
grain; for half a year a fine, green stalk shall stand there, 
with full, thick 


Sermon on Tit. 





2, 13. W. IX, 604-606. 945 
Ears. So we Christians should not look at the body that 
is laid in the grave, but at the body that will rise again 
from the grave and come forth. Just as we stand against 
the creature, hoping and waiting that out of the seed that 
is cast into the earth will grow a beautiful grain, and that 
out of the seed that is planted will grow a tree, so we 
should also stand against our body, believing without a 
doubt that it will rise again from the dead. A 
husbandman, when he sows the field, does not look so 
keenly at the grain he has in his hand as he looks at the 
grain that will stand in the field for half a year. He turns 
his eyes and heart away from the grain he has in his 
hand and looks much more diligently at the grain that will 
come afterward. 

(25) Therefore we Christians should also look much 
more diligently to the life to come, and wait for it much 
more surely than for this present life in which we now 
live. Through baptism we are sown, and through death 
we must decay. When the hour comes for us to die, we 
should think, "Well, let us die and decay; it must and 
should be so with the human body, as with the grain that 
falls into the earth and decays. But just as the 
husbandman waits for another grain, which he does not 
yet see, and which in its time will be found in the field, so 
certainly, even more certainly, | will wait for another, 
future life, even though | do not yet see it. This is how we 
Christians should be. 

But where are they who wait in such certain hope for 
eternal life? The largest crowd in the world pretends not 
to long for eternal life. A farmer knows the art and has 
the virtue of waiting for his beans and pods in the garden 
and for the fruit in the field, which he does not yet see, 
but we Christians still lack this art by far. This is not at all 
what the nature of reason wants in us when it comes to 
faith and our Christianity. A farmer can say: Now | am 
planting vain young beans and pods, sowing vain young 
grain; but a Christian cannot say: 


946 en. (L) 18, 48-S1. Interpretation on the Epistle to Titus. W. IX, 606-609. 


947 





Now | live, and | do not know how long; but even if | die, 
| am waiting for another life, which is much more certain 
to me than this life, which | see now. Even if my body now 
suffers, dies and decays, the same body will come forth 
again and will no longer be able to suffer, die and decay. 
Of this | am sure, for | have been baptized and have the 
word of God; therefore | am God's bean and grain, who 
planted and sowed me through baptism and the gospel. 
1) 

27. In this way, a farmer could make a fine Bible out 
of his field, and from the seed he sows, study and learn 
the article: "| believe in the resurrection of the dead," and 
say, "This grain, which | sow now, shall lose its essence; 
but there shall grow up out of it a beautiful green stalk, 
as long as | am, yielding thirty, sixty, a hundred grains; 
and out of this bean, which | now put into the ground, 
shall grow a stalk, yielding young fresh beans. This is my 
dear book, from which | study and learn that my body, 
when it is buried in the earth, will become a beautiful, 
living body; for in this work of the field, which | now have 
before my hand, that | sow and plant, God will teach me 
his work, if he will one day work in me. Just as | now sow 
grain and plant beans, so God sows and plants me 
through baptism and the Word; therefore | am His bean 
and grain. Now when | die and rot, this stinking, 
corruptible body will become a fragrant, incorruptible 
body. 

(28) But the wicked devil and our flesh make it so that 
we do not do this, but rather sting, scrape, scratch, and 
begin strangely, as if there were no life left but this 
present life. Thus, with such a nature, we disgrace our 
Christian life. In name we are Christians, but in deed we 
are mere swine: we have no thoughts at all of waiting for 
another life. No husbandman does with the grain what 
we do with our bodies. For no one is so minded that he 
should

torture. Vias Lussd. Uist." 





for this reason, that it may remain in the field forever. But 
we have baptism, the word, and are thereby sown and 
planted by God for another life; nevertheless, we think 
that baptism and the gospel were given to us so that we 
should remain here in this world forever. 

Therefore St. Paul admonishes us here and says: 
"No, dear friends, opinion does not have it; the saving 
grace of God did not appear for us to remain here in this 
world forever. There is something else than this life on 
earth; there straighten yourselves. You may work, feed 
yourselves godly and honestly, eat and drink because 
you are here, but you should know that this is not the 
main thing, nor your eternal treasure, but it is the piece 
of cake that belongs to this life, to maintain the belly, as 
it also ends with the belly. The saving grace of God has 
appeared for this reason, that you should hope and wait 
for another life, for which you were baptized, and of 
which the gospel teaches you; for to this end our Lord 
Jesus Christ will also appear as a great God and true 
Savior, to deliver us from this misery and take us into his 
kingdom. 

(30) Then it will be glorious with the Christians. Now 
it is going on horribly and shamefully with them. A 
Christian, when he dies, stinks just as a Turk and godless 
man; there is no difference between a Christian and an 
un-Christian. Moreover, Christians here on earth are 
subjected to the cross, are persecuted and plagued by 
the devil and men everywhere, must be the footcloth of 
all the world, are driven away from everything they have, 
and in addition are blasphemed, desecrated and 
condemned; therefore Christians are not glorious in this 
world. In contrast, the world is glorious, worshiped and 
celebrated. Christians are trampled underfoot, the world 
is carried on the hands. 

This is the brightness and glory of our Lord Jesus 
Christ on earth, that he is despised and rejected, but he 
will come and appear in glory, bringing with him a 
brightness that will be glorious, so that all creatures will 
be more beautiful than they are now. "The sun's light will 
be seven times brighter than it is now; the moon's light 
will be more beautiful than it is now. 


948 


Erk. (2.) 18, 51-53. 


Sermon on Tit. 


2, 13. W. IX, 609-612. 949 





Trees, foliage, grass, fruits and everything will be seven 
times more beautiful than now. Is. 30, 26. 65, 17. 2 Petr. 
3, 13. Revelation 21, 1. The Christians will then come 
out of the graves and shine as the most beautiful, shining 
stars. A holy martyr, who is now persecuted and burned 
to powder for the sake of Christ and His Gospel, as a 
dark, black star, will then float in the air, be twitched 
towards the Lord in the clouds, and ascend to heaven as 
a bright, shining, glorious star, Dan. 12, 3. Summa, all 
the elect and saints of God will be in the greatest glory. 
He Himself, the Lord Jesus, will sit in the clouds "on the 
throne of His glory, and before Him will be gathered all 
the families of the earth", Matth. 25, 31. f. The whole 
world will be transfigured and will be a hundred thousand 
times more glorious than it is now. Summa, he will 
appear, that it will be called appeared. 

But why does he call it an "appearance of the great 
God"? Are all three persons of the eternal divine majesty 
equally eternal, equally great, as Athanasius says in his 
Symbolo? Answer: He does not speak here of the 
essence of God, or of some person in the Godhead, but 
of the appearance. He does not say that our Lord Jesus 
Christ, according to his nature and divine essence, is 
now small, but now great, but that he will appear on the 
day of his future and show himself as a great God. 
According to his divine nature, he is always equally 
great, but according to his appearance and revelation, 
he is not always equally great. For before the last day he 
has not yet revealed nor shown his greatness, but on the 
day of his future he will show himself and let us see how 
great and glorious God he is. Now he is small, according 
to the appearance and display; he lets pope, emperor, 
kings, lords, princes, citizens, peasants play and do with 
his gospel and with his Christians as they themselves 
want, as if he were a puppet god who does not see, does 
not hear, does not know, nor understand. But then he 
will be great and appear in his majesty, so that they will 
see in whom they have stabbed. 


In the day of his flesh he was small; indeed, he was, 
as he himself says, Matth. 11, 11, "the smallest in the 
kingdom of heaven. "For though he was in divine form 
(says St. Paul Phil. 2, 6-8.), he nevertheless manifested 
himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, and 
was made like another man, and in his ways was found 
to be a man; he humbled himself, and became obedient 
unto death, even death on a cross," and allowed himself 
to be caught, bound, spit upon, scourged, crucified, and 
killed, and in all these things presented himself as if there 
were no greatness, no power, no majesty. As the Gospel 
testifies, his enemies and crucifiers shouted and cried 
out, "Won!" Marc. 15:29 ff: "Fie on you, how finely you 
break down the temple and build it in three days! Help 
yourself now and come down from the cross. He has 
helped others, and cannot help himself. If he is Christ 
and King in Israel, let him now come down from the 
cross, that we may see and believe. 

34 In the realm of faith he still presents himself like 
this today. Even though he has risen from the dead, 
ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of God in 
divine power and glory, he still hides his greatness, 
clarity, majesty and power, has his prophets and 
apostles chased away and murdered, Paul beheaded, 
Peter crucified, his holy martyrs thrown into bands and 
prisons, beaten, stoned, hacked to pieces, stabbed and 
miserably killed; His Christians in the world suffer want, 
affliction and adversity, just as in the day of his flesh. 
John the Baptist had to lose his head for the sake of a 
desperate whore; he, the Savior and Helper, was silent 
about it, "went away on a ship into a desert alone", Matth. 
14, 10. ff. Marc. 6, 27. 32. Is this not a small, childish 
God, who does not save Himself and lets His children 
suffer as if He does not see how badly they are doing? 

(35) And so it is, as the Scriptures of the prophets 
and the Psalms have declared, that the wicked boast, 
mocking the Christians and their God, and say, "Where 
is their God? Ps. 115, 2. If he is God, he will take care of 
himself and his people, so that his name will not be cut 
off like this, and his people will not suffer like this. If he 
sees and knows not these things, he hath not eyes to 
see, neither understanding, 


950 ei. 2.) 18, 53-55. interpretation on the letter to Titus. W. IX. 612-614. 


That he may know it. But if he sees it and knows it and 
lets it happen, he is not a pious, faithful God and has no 
heart for his people. If he sees and knows, and cannot 
help, he does not have hands that can do anything, nor 
power that he can save. Therefore the prophet Isaiah 
says of him, Cap. 45, 15: "Truly thou art a hidden God, 
O God of Israel, the Savior." For he hides his 
omnipotence, wisdom, power and _ strength, and 
presents himself childishly, as if he could do nothing, 
knew nothing, understood nothing, or did not want to do 
it. Now he lets our adversaries handle his word, 
sacraments and Christians as they wish; he lets us call 
and shout, and is silent about it, just as if he were writing, 
or would be busy, or would be over the field, or would be 
asleep and not hear, as Elijah says about Baal, 1 Kings 
18:27. 18, 27. But he will show his greatness, his 
omnipotence and his power, as it is written Ps. 78, 65. 
66.: "The Lord awakens like a sleeping man, like a strong 
man rejoices, who comes from wine. And smiteth his 
enemies in the butt, and hangeth upon them an 
everlasting reproach.” 

(36) Inthe meantime, Christians baptized in his name 
must keep still, let their feet run over them, and be 
patient. For in the realm of faith he will be small, but in 
the realm of sight he will not be small, but great. Then he 
will show that he has seen the misery of his people, and 
heard their cries, and had an inclined will to help them, 
and also had strength enough that he could help. Now 
he hides his good will, his power and strength, but when 
he will appear, then he will reveal his will, his power and 
strength. Now he can also help and save, he has 
strength enough that he can do it; there is no lack of will 
that he wants to do it; but all this is covered in the word 
that we cannot see it, but must grasp it with faith. But on 
the day of his coming he will remove the cover and 
appear as a great God, and do justice to his name, so 
that people will say: This is a Lord and Savior. 

We must wait for such a manifestation of the glory of 
the great God. For 


951 


Before such an appearance he does not show his 
omnipotence, power, strength, will and help, but rules 
and leads his Christianity in weakness under the cross, 
has his gospel and name blasphemed and desecrated, 
his Christians persecuted, reviled, strangled and killed, 
and remains silent about it. He lets himself be called a 
savior and helper, but in reality he does not show himself 
so fully and obviously as a savior and helper. But when 
he will come and appear, then he will prove his 
omnipotence, wisdom, power and help fully and 
obviously, so that the devil together with all his scales will 
have to confess and say: This is a great God. Until now 
we did not know why the Christians believed, confessed, 
worshipped, honored and praised their Christ as a God 
and Savior, but now we learn it by deed, for he truly 
proves that he bore such a name with honor. 

38 This is the reason why St. Paul calls Christ a great 
God, because he wants to give it to understand that he 
will reveal his great majesty and power on the day of his 
appearance before all creatures. He will not lie in a 
manger, nor ride on a donkey, as he did in the first future, 
but will burst forth from the clouds with great power and 
glory. He will not let his Christians be trampled underfoot, 
but will make them beautiful stars and suns, so that they 
will shine and shine before all creatures. Thus he also 
speaks 2 Thess. 1, 7. ff.When therefore the Lord Jesus 
shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his 
power, and with flames of fire, to execute vengeance 
upon them that know not God, and upon them which 
obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall 
suffer punishment, and everlasting destruction from the 
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 
when he shall come to shine gloriously with his saints, 
and marvelously with all them that believe." Summa, he 
will appear and reveal himself in such a way that all 
creatures will recognize and see that he was mighty over 
his enemies and was able and willing to help his people. 
Whether he already before the blessed day of his future 
his 


952 


Erl. (S.) 18, 55-57. 


If he did not show and reveal his omnipotence, wisdom, 
power and will, he never lacked omnipotence, wisdom, 
power and will, but wanted to hide himself so that he 
revealed himself in his own time. 

(39) And this is also the blessed hope, for which, as 
he said, we must wait, that we may hope and wait for the 
appearing and manifestation of his omnipotence, 
wisdom, glory, power and authority. Now there seems to 
be none; indeed, the contradiction seems to be. 
Therefore it is necessary that we hold fast to the word 
and strengthen ourselves in faith, patience and hope until 
the hour of his glory and power and our salvation comes: 
as a husbandman must stand in hope through the winter, 
waiting for his grain, until it breaks forth from the earth in 
the spring, grows and grows green. 

40 But before the hour comes, and we have to wait 
for it, we should spend our lives in good works, so that 
we live godly before God, justly toward our neighbor and 
chastely toward ourselves. "For this cause," says Titus 
2:14, "Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem 
us from all unrighteousness, and purify unto himself a 
people for his own possession, diligent to do good 
works." 

Now we have often heard what good works are, since 
through baptism and the gospel we have come to the 
light and knowledge that we know what good works are, 
which was not known in the papacy. Before the Gospel 
came, they preached that good works were those which 
we ourselves devised and chose out of our own devotion; 
as that one went to St. James, the other to another 
pilgrimage; the former gave the monks into the 
monastery, and had many masses said; the latter put up 
little wax lights, fasted on water and bread, and prayed 
so many rosaries 2c. But now that the Gospel is coming, 
let us preach that good works are not those which we 
choose of our own accord, but those which God has 
commanded; as when each one does what God has 
commanded him to do, and what is required of him in his 
position here on earth. 

A servant does good works when he fears God, 
believes in Christ, and enters into the obedience of his 
master. First 


Sermon On Tit. 





2, 13. W. IX, 614-617. 953 
He is righteous before God through faith in Christ, then 
he walks by faith, leads a godly life, is moderate and 
chaste, serves his neighbor, mucks out the barn, feeds 
the horses 2c. If he goes in in such works, he does better 
works than no Carthusian. For since he is baptized, 
believes in Christ, and waits in certain hope for eternal 
life, he goes forth, is obedient to his Lord, and knows 
what he does in his profession, that it pleases God. 
Therefore, what he does in his profession is all good and 
delicious. It does not seem that they are great, excellent 
works when he rides in the field, drives in the mill, etc., 
but because God's command and order is there, such 
works, however small they may seem, cannot be and are 
called anything else but vain good works and services of 
God. . 43 So also, a maid does good works when she 
does her work in faith, and does what she is called a 
woman when she sweeps the house, washes dishes and 
cooks in the kitchen 2c. Even if such works do not seem 
like the works of a Carthusian, who has a mask around 
him and opens people's mouths, they are still much 
better and more delicious works in the sight of God than 
the works of a Carthusian, who wears a hard shirt, keeps 
his early hours, looks at night, sings for five hours and 
eats no meat 2c. For though these are shining and 
shining works in the sight of the world, yet they have no 
commandment and commandment of God; how then 
can they be good works that please God? Likewise, 
when a citizen, a farmer, helps his neighbor, serves him 
in whatever way he can, warns him when he sees that 
he might suffer harm to his body, wife, child, servants, 
livestock and goods, helps him where he needs his help 
2c., such works do not appear either; but they are 
nevertheless vainly good, delicious works. 

(44) When worldly authorities punish the wicked and 
protect the pious, when the subjects are subject and 
obedient to their authorities, and do so in faith in Christ 
and in hope of eternal life, these are good works, even 
though they do not shine or appear before reason. For 
what God does on earth through His Christians and 
saints is not to shine or shine before the world, but rather 
to be a good deed. 


954 en. (s.) 18, 57-59. Interpretation On the Epistle to Titus. W. IX, 617-620. 


The devil will be black, despised and condemned by the 
devil and the world. Again, what the devil does through 
his hypocrites and false saints should shine and shine, 
so that all the world opens its mouth and nose, and is 
amazed at it, as if it were a good, delicious thing, when 
itis all the devil's deceit and lies. If one consults reason, 
then the works of a servant, a maid, a master, a wife, a 
mayor and a judge are mean, small works compared to 
the fact that a Carthusian watches, fasts, prays and 
does not eat meat. But if one takes God's word into 
consideration, the works of all the houses and monks, 
even if they were all melted down into one heap, are not 
as good as the works of a few poor maidservants who 
are placed in God's kingdom through baptism, who 
believe in Christ, and who wait in faith for the blessed 
hope. 

(45) These two things St. Paul wished to preserve in 
Christendom: the knowledge of our Saviour Jesus 
Christ, and the knowledge of our commanded office; that 
we might know our Christian estate aright; first, that we 
are called through baptism and the gospel to be heirs of 
eternal life; wherefore we also ought to wait for the 
blessed hope and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Secondly, because we have now become Christians 
and heirs of the kingdom of heaven, that everything we 
do by faith in our profession and state is good and 
precious work, therefore we should also be diligent to do 
good works. And these two things we should learn well. 
The first, of blessed hope, we must have for that life, that 
we may know where we are to abide when this life is 
ended. The other, of good works, we must have for this 
life, that we may know how to keep ourselves in our 
state and office. 

46 Therefore, since we have heard what our blessed 
hope is, for which we should wait, we should now also 
learn what good works are, namely, those that are done 
by faith, in our commanded ministry, according to God's 
commandment and word. Although such works do not 
shine in the sight of reason, they are nevertheless 
delicious in the sight of God. 





955 


Monk, that he may see and know them. So, | am a 
preacher, that is my office; if | now believe in Christ, and 
wait for the blessed hope, and thereupon go, wait for my 
preaching, and do my office, although my work has a low 
reputation, yet | would not interpret with all the monks 
and nuns, and with all their works, which they do in the 
monastery. 1) And so, through baptism and faith in 
Christ, | have my knowledge of that life, and through 
God's word, a report for this present life, how | should 
conduct myself in it. 

47 Awife is also a living saint if she believes in Christ, 
waits for the blessed hope and appearing of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and then goes and does what is proper for 
a wife. For our works, which we do in our commanded 
office, even though they are regarded by the world as 
common and small works, will be praiseworthy in the 
sight of God if they are done out of faith in Christ and in 
the hope of eternal life. 

(48) But, as | said, the world is not worthy to see and 
know a good work. For as reason knows nothing of the 
blessed hope of eternal life, so neither does it 
understand what good works are. Thus it thinks: This 
maid milks the cows, this farmer plows the field; these 
are all common, small works, which also the heathen do; 
how then can they be good works? But this one becomes 
a monk, that one becomes a nun, looks sour, puts on a 
cap, wears a hair shirt: these are special works that other 
people do not do, therefore they must be good works. 
This is how reason thinks. Thus one comes from the 
knowledge, both of the blessed hope and of good works. 

(49) Therefore no one can know either this present 
life or that which is to come, nor can he really send 
himself to it, unless he is a Christian. He says, "God has 
given me eternal life through His Son, and | was baptized 
into it and called to it through the gospel, so | will wait for 
it with confidence. But besides this he has given me

956 Erl. (2.) 18, 59-61. 
| am to be a master, a wife, a servant, a maid, a 
schoolmaster, a preacher, 2c. and to serve him in my 
profession; therefore | will also be diligent in good works, 
a fine godly servant, an obedient, disciplined maid, a 
diligent schoolmaster, a faithful preacher, and do what 
is pleasing to God. 

Whoever knows these things and acts accordingly, 
his life will not be difficult or sour, and he will not grumble 
against God, even though he is sometimes in a bad way. 
For because he is sure of eternal life, and waits for the 
blessed hope and appearing of the Savior Jesus Christ, 
he gladly does and suffers all that he should do and 
suffer. Then, because he recognizes his calling and 
knows that he serves God in it, he is undaunted to carry 
out his commanded work. Even though the world is evil 
and wicked, and life in this world is dangerous and 
arduous, and the works he does are of little repute, he 
knows that his position and office are divine, and the 
works he does in such a position are good and pleasing 
in the sight of God. Therefore, lead this life with a good 
conscience and a happy heart, and say: Here | serve 
God as long as | live, and wait for the blessed hope and 
appearance of my Savior Jesus Christ; when He will 
reveal Himself from heaven, | will possess eternal life. 
But whoever does not know this and does not act 
accordingly, his life must become sour and difficult. 
Because he is not sure of eternal life and does not wait 
for the blessed hope, he cannot be satisfied nor have 
patience. As soon as things change and do not go as he 
wants, he becomes impatient and grumbles against 
God. After that, because he is not sure whether his 
deeds will please God 


Heb. 11:13-16. 


All these died in faith, not having received the 
promise, but having seen it afar off, and having been put 
off, and having been well pleased, and having confessed 
that they were sojourners and strangers on the earth. For 
those who say this indicate that they are looking for a 
homeland. And that is, where they would have meant the 
one from which they came. 


Sermon on: Tit. 2, 13. 





957 


W. IX, 620-623. 


If he falls, he can have no joy in his heart nor a good 
conscience in his work, so he brings this life to fear, 
sorrow and a heavy nature, and loses eternal life with it. 
Because he lives on earth, he lives like a sow; when he 
is to die, he has no hope, weeps, laments and says: "My 
life has become sour, now | must leave it and die, and | 
do not know where to go. 

(51) It serves such a man right; why does he not learn 
these two things: first, what his hope is, and what he has 
to wait for in heaven; then also how he should send 
himself into his office, and how he should live here on 
earth? Because he has not learned any of these things, 
it cannot be otherwise; this life must become sour and 
difficult for him, and he must have hell to go with it. But 
a Christian who knows these two things has here a 
sweet life on earth, and there eternal life through Christ 
our Savior. Even though he has much toil and 
unpleasure in his position, he still has joy in his heart and 
a good conscience in his toil and labor, because he 
knows that his work and labor are all good works and 
services to God. If he is a servant, he is happy and in 
good spirits; if he goes into the woods, rides in the field, 
he sings; if his master is strange, scolds him and does 
him wrong, he has patience and waits for another life. 

(52) Therefore we are to learn these two things 
diligently, that we may know what our hope is, not in this 
life, but in another life to come, and how we are to live 
godly in this world, and be diligent in good works. And 
that is enough of this saying for this time; may our dear 
God grant us His grace to live by it, amen. 


they had time to turn back. But now they desire a better 
one, namely a heavenly one, therefore God is not 
ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a 
city for them.

Preached in 1522 and 1523; printed toward the end of 1523. 


[Preface by D. Martin Luther.] 


Before we come to the Epistle of St. Peter, it is 
necessary that we give a brief instruction, so that one 
may know what this Epistle is to be held for and have a 
proper understanding of it. 

2 First of all, it is to be known that all the apostles’ 
teachings are one; and it is not right to count four

and mercy of God, earned and acquired through the

is shouted out publicly, so that it is heard everywhere. 


evangelists and four gospels, for all that the apostles 
have written is one. One gospel. Gospel but 





S) In the course of 1522 and deep into 1523 Luther preached on the first epistle of St. Peter on Sunday afternoons. This is reported to 
us in an index of the Zwickau Luther finding. (Buchwald, Andreas Poach's handwritten collection of unprinted sermons of D. Martin Luther 2c. 
Erster Band, erste Halfte, Seite XVI. Leipzig 1884): "Den Nachmittag s*.nno 1523% hatt er die erste und 2. epistel S. Petri vnd Juda gepredigt." 
Still in 1523, the sermons on the first epistle of St. Peter appeared in print, probably not until the end of the year, under the title: Epistle St. 
Peter preached and interpreted by Mart. Luther." At the end: "Gedruckt zu Wittemberg durch Nickel Schyrlentz ym drey vnd zwentzigsten 
jar." In addition to other individual editions of the first letter in 1523 and 1524, two editions were published in 1524, one by Adam Petri in 
Basel, and one by Silvanus Ottmar in Augsburg, to which the interpretations of the second epistle of St. Peter and Jude were also added. 
Bucer translated the interpretations of the two epistles of Peter and the Epistle of Jude into Latin. This translation was published in July 1524 
in Strasbourg by Johann Herwagen, and in May 1525 another edition was published there. In the "Gesammtausgabe": Jenaer (1585), vol. Il, 
p. 293d; Altenburger, vol. Il, p. 405; Leipziger, vol. XI, p. 479; Walch, vol. IX, col. 624; Erlanger, vol. 51, p. 324 and Weimarsche, vol. XIl, p. 
249. Bucer's Latin translation: Wittenberger (1554), Dom. V, col. 439d. - This interpretation did not come from Luther's own pen, but was 
copied and edited by Caspar Cruciger. Since Luther later preached again on the first epistle of St. Peter, Georg Rérer changed some things 
in the first edition on the basis of these sermons and also added much from the same. The reason that no single edition of this review appeared 
is that Rorer had made this revision for the first volume of Luther's collected works, which came out in 1539. Luther's sermons on the First 
Letter of Peter were still in progress when the publication of this first volume was already in progress. The last sermon, which was used for 
the improvement of the first redaction, about | Petr. 5, 9, Luther held on July 13, 1539. To give this (so far unknown) exact time determination, 
has been made possible by the Zwickau Lutherfund. If one takes into account the "Luther's" writings from the same in this volume sub Xo. X, 
0, the "Five Sermons on | Petri Cap. 4 and 5" with this interpretation, one will recognize the correctness of the information we have given. 
Probably Luther's sermons on the first letter of Peter will extend back into the year 1538. The improved text is found only in the Wittenberg 
edition (1556), vol. I, p. 473 d and in the Erlangen, vol. 52, p. |. Walch had only the text of the first edition. In the next number, however, we 
will bring the improved text according to the Wittenberg edition. Luther's preface, which precedes the second edition in the Wittenberg edition, 
is not a preface to this interpretation, but a preface to the epistle itself, which had already appeared in print in 1522 in the German translation 
of the New Testament. Therefore, we leave it here "nd will place it, as Walch did, in the fourteenth volume of our edition under Luther's 
prefaces to the biblical books. In the Erlangen edition it appears twice, namely vol. 52, p. | and vol. 63, p. 151. The preface to the first 
interpretation is missing in the German Wittenberg edition, but is found in the other editions, also in the Latin translation, which reproduces 
the first redaction. We give the text according to the Weimar edition.

hears. So it is not a book of laws that has much good 
doctrine in it, as it has been held until now. For it does 
not tell us to do works to become godly, but proclaims to 
us the grace of God, freely given and without our merit, 
and tells us how Christ interceded for us, and was 
sufficient for our sin, and blots it out, and makes us godly 
and blessed by his works. 

3 Whoever preaches or describes these things 
teaches the true gospel, as do all the apostles, 
especially St. Paul and Peter in their epistles. Therefore 
all that is preached of Christ is one gospel, even though 
one preaches it in a different way and speaks of it in 
different words than the other. For it may be a short ora 
long speech, and described in a short or a long way. But 
if the point is that Christ is our Savior, and that we are 
justified and saved through faith in him, without our 
works, then it is one word and one gospel; just as there 
is only one faith and one baptism in all Christendom. 

(4) Thus one apostle has written the same things that 
are written in the other; but those who do this most and 
most highly, how faith in Christ alone justifies, are the 
best evangelists. Therefore, St. Paul's epistles are more 
of a gospel than Matthew, Marcus and Lucas. For these 
do not describe much more than the history of the works 
and 





miraculous signs of Christ; but the grace that we have 
through Christ, no one so boldly as St. Paul, especially 
in the epistle to the Romans. Since the word is more 
important than the works and deeds of Christ, and since 
it would be better to lack works and history than words 
and doctrine, those books are to be praised most highly 
which deal most with the doctrine and word of the Lord 
Christ. For even if the miraculous works of Christ were 
not there, and we knew nothing of them, we would still 
have enough of the word, without which we could not 
have life. 

5 So this epistle of St. Peter is also one of the noblest 
books in the New Testament, and the true, righteous 
gospel. For it also does the same thing that St. Paul and 
all the evangelists do, that it teaches righteous faith, as 
Christ is given to us, who takes away our sin and makes 
us blessed, as we shall hear. 

(6) From this you may judge of all books and 
doctrines what is or is not the gospel. For what is not 
preached or written in this way, you may freely judge that 
itis false, however good it may seem. All Christians have 
this power to judge, not the pope or concilia, who boast 
that they alone have the power to judge doctrine. That is 
enough for the introduction and preface. Now let us hear 
the epistle. 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. 2. Peter, an apostle of JEsu Christ, to the 
elect strangers to and fro in Ponto, Galatia, 
Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, according to the 
provision of GOD the Father, in sanctification of the 
Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of 
JEsu Christ. 

1 This is the superscription and signature. Here you 
will soon see that it is the gospel. He says he is an 
apostle; that is, a mouth messenger. That is why it is 
properly Germanized, a messenger, or messenger of 
twelve, because of the twelve. But because it is now 
understood what Apostolus, 





the Greek word, that is why | have not translated it. But 
actually it means a mouth messenger; not one who 
carries letters, but a skillful one who presents and 
advertises a matter orally, which in Latin is called 
oratores. So now he wants to say: | am an apostle of 
Jesus Christ, that is, | have a command from Jesus 
Christ that | should preach about Christ. 

2 Notice how all who preach the doctrine of men are 
soon excluded. For he is a messenger of Jesus Christ, 
who preaches that which Christ commanded. If he 
preaches otherwise 


962 en. 51, 328-330. interpretations on the | Epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 630-633. 


963 





he is not a messenger of Christ; therefore he is not to be 
heard. But if he does, it is just as much as if you hear 
Christ himself present. 


To the chosen strangers back and forth, in Ponto, 
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. 


3 He wrote this epistle in the lands that are here. In 
former times it was Christian, but now the Turk has it 
under him; nevertheless one finds perhaps still 
Christians there. Pontus is a large and wide land by the 
sea. Cappadocia is also close to it, almost touching it. 
Galatia lies behind it. Asia and Bithynia in front on the 
sea, all lie toward the east, and are large countries. Paul 
also preached in Galatia and Asia; whether also in 
Bithynia, | do not know. In the last two 1) he did not 
preach. Foreigners are those whom we call foreigners. 
So he calls them, because they were Gentiles. And it is 
a wonder that St. Peter, because he was an apostle of 
the Jews, nevertheless writes here to the Gentiles. The 


Jews called them proselytos, that is, fellow Jews, who 
came to their law, and were not of the Jewish tribe and 
blood of Abraha. Therefore he writes to those who were 
Gentiles before, but now converted to the faith, and 
joined the believing Jews, and calls them "chosen 
strangers", who are certainly Christians; to them alone 
he writes. This is also a good point, as we will hear. 


V. 2. According to the providence of God the 
Father. 


You are chosen (he says). How? Not by themselves, 
but according to God's order. For we will not be able to 
bring ourselves to heaven, or make faith in us. God will 
not let all people into heaven; He will even count His own 
exactly. The human doctrine of free will and our powers 
is no longer valid. It is not up to our will, but to God's will 
and election. 


In the sanctification of the spirit. 


God has provided for us that we should be holy, and 
thus that we should become spiritually holy. The sacred 
word "holy" and "spiritual" have also been perverted by 
the ventriloquists, 


1) That is, in the first two mentioned, Pontus and Cappadocia. In 
the second adaptation: "in the other two". 





that they have called their status as priests and monks 
holy and spiritual, and have so disgracefully taken away 
the noble, precious name, as well as the name "church," 
that the pope and bishops are the church; they say that 
the church has commanded it, if they do what they want 
according to their will. Holiness is not to be monks, 
priests and nuns, to wear plates and robes. It is a 
spiritual word, that we are holy from the heart in the spirit 
before God. And he actually said this to indicate that 
nothing is holy except the holiness that God works in us. 
For at that time the Jews had much outward holiness, 
but it was not true holiness. This is what Peter wants to 
say: God has provided you to be truly holy; as St. Paul 
also says, Eph. 4:24: "In righteousness and holiness of 
the truth", that is, in a righteous and basic holiness; for 
the outward holiness, as the Jews had, counts for 
nothing before God. 

6 So the Scripture calls us holy, because we still live 
here on earth, if we believe. But the papists have taken 
this name from us and say: We are not to be holy, the 
saints in heaven alone are holy. Therefore we must get 
the noble name again. You must be holy; but you must 
make yourself so that you do not think that you are holy 
of yourself or by your merit, but because you hold the 
word of God, that heaven is yours, that you are 
righteously pious and have become holy through Christ. 
You must confess this if you want to be a Christian. For 
that would be the greatest dishonor and blasphemy of 
the name of Christ, if we would not give glory to the blood 
of Christ, that it might wash away our sins, or believe that 
the blood makes us holy. Therefore you must believe 
and confess that you are holy, but through this blood, not 
through your piety; so that you leave life and what you 
have, and wait for what may come to you because of it. 


To the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of 
JEsu Christ. 


(7) Thus, he says, we become holy when we are 
submissive and believe the Word. 


964 Erl. 51, 330-333. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr, I, 2-9. W. IX, 633-636. 


Christ, and are sprinkled 1) with his blood. And here St. 
Peter speaks in a slightly different way than St. Paul; but 
it is just as much as when Paul says that we are saved 
through faith in 2) Christ. For faith makes us obedient 
and subject to Christ and his word. Therefore, to be 
under the word of God and under Christ, and to be 
sprinkled 1) by His blood, is as much as to believe. For 
it is hard for nature, it fights against it, and breaks itself 
3) very much in that it should give itself so completely 
under Christ, and cease from all its things, and even 
despise its things and consider them sin. But still she 
must give herself up. 

8) The Psalm Miserere [Ps. 51, 9.] also says about 
sprinkling: "Lord, sprinkle me with hyssop and | will be 
cleansed. It runs 4) on the law of Moses, there St. Peter 
has drawn it, and wants to reveal to us the Moses, and 
to lead into the Scriptures. When Moses built the 
tabernacle, he took the blood of the goat and sprinkled 
the tabernacle and all the people, Ex. 24, 6. 8. [Hebr. 9, 
19,] The sprinkling does not sanctify in the spirit, but only 
outwardly; therefore a spiritual cleansing must take 
place [Hebr. 9, 13. 14.] That was an outward and carnal 
holiness, which is not valid in the sight of God; therefore 
God meant by this sprinkling the spiritual sprinkling. 
Therefore Peter says: "The Jews are in the holiness that 
is outward, are pious before men and of an honorable 
life; but you are considered wicked men. But ye have a 
better sprinkling, being sprinkled in the Spirit, that ye 
may be pure from within. The Jews. sprinkled 
themselves outwardly with the blood of goats; but we are 
sprinkled inwardly in the conscience, as the heart 
becomes pure and glad. 

9 So the Gentiles are no longer Gentiles, the pious 
Jews with their sprinkling are no longer pious, but it is 
now reversed. It must be a sprinkling that turns us 
around and makes us spiritual. Sprinkling means 
preaching that Christ has shed his blood.

and comes to his Father on our behalf, saying, "Dear 
Father, do you see my blood that | have shed for this 
sinner? If you believe this, you are sprinkled. So you see 
the right way to preach. If all the popes, monks and 
priests melted all their things into one heap, they could 
not teach and accomplish as much as St. Peter did here 
with few words. 

(10) Now this is the signature of the epistle, wherein 
he signifieth his ministry, which he preacheth; as we 
have heard. Therefore this alone is the gospel; let all the 
rest, which is not of this nature, be trampled under foot, 
and let all other books go, where you find pretty titles of 
works and prayers and indulgences, which do not teach 
such things, and are not publicly founded thereon. All 
papal books have not one letter of this obedience, of this 
blood and sprinkling. Now follows the greeting to those 
to whom he writes. 


Grace and peace multiply among you. 


(11) Then St. Peter of the Apostle Paul's way of 
greeting, though not entirely, is said, "You now have 
peace and grace, but not yet fully; therefore you must 
always increase until the old Adam dies. "Grace" is 
God's grace, which now begins in us, but must work for 
and for and increase until [death]. Whoever recognizes 
this and believes that he has a gracious God, has Him; 
so his heart also gains peace, and fears neither the 
world nor the devil. For he knows that God, who is 
powerful in all things, is his friend, and wants to help him 
out of death, hell, [and] all misfortune, therefore his 
conscience has peace and joy. This is what St. Peter 
wishes the faithful; and this is a proper Christian 
greeting, with which all Christians should greet each 
other. Thus we have the superscription with the greeting. 
Now he starts the epistle and speaks: 


V. 3-9, Glory be to God, and to the Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy 
has given us new birth into a living hope through the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, into an 
incorruptible and undefiled and  unfading 
inheritance, which is to be

is in heaven upon you, who by the power of God are 
kept in faith unto salvation, which is prepared to be 
revealed at the last time, in the which ye shall rejoice, 
who now for a little while (where it shall be) are 
sorrowful in many temptations; That your faith may 
be proved more precious than the gold that perisheth 
(is proved by fire), to the praise and honour of Jesus 
Christ, whom ye have not seen, yet love, in whom ye 
also believe, but see not yet. But for faith's sake ye 
shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, and 
shall bring away the end of your faith, even the 
salvation of your souls. 


In this preface, you see a proper apostolic speech 
and entrance to the matter, and as | also said before 1), 
that this is an example of a beautiful epistle. For there 
he already begins, and explains what Christ is, and what 
we have obtained through him, since he speaks that 
God has born us again to a living hope, through the 
resurrection of Christ. Item, that all goods are given to 
us by the Father, without our merit, out of pure mercy. 
These are true evangelical words that should be 
preached. Help God, how little of this sermon is found in 
all books, even those that are supposed to be the best. 
As St. Jerome and St. Augustine wrote, how it does not 
rhyme with these words at all! It is therefore necessary 
to preach about Jesus Christ, that he died and rose 
again, and why he died and rose again, so that people 
may believe in him through such preaching and be 
saved through faith. This is called preaching the right 
gospel. What is not preached in this way is not the 
gospel, so be it to whomever will. 

This is now Summa Summarum of these words: 
Christ has led us to the Father through his resurrection. 
With this, St. Peter wants to lead us to the Father 
through the Lord Christ, and makes him the mediator 
between God and us. So far we have been preached 
that we should call upon the saints, 


1) In the preface, § 5. 


967 


that they might be our intercessors against God; then we 
ran to Our Lady and made her our mediatrix, leaving 
Christ as an angry judge. This the Scripture does not do; 
it goes and presses closer, and praises the Lord Christ, 
that he is our mediator, through whom we must come to 
the Father. Oh, it is an exceeding great good that is 
given to us through Christ, that we may come before the 
Father and claim the inheritance of which St. Peter 
speaks here. 

(14) And these words show what the apostle meant, 
that he begins to praise the Father with great devotion, 
and wants us to praise and adore him, because of the 
abundant riches he has given us, in that he has given us 
birth again, and thus born, before we ever thought of it 
or had the means to do so. There is nothing to praise 
but mere mercy. Therefore we cannot boast of any 
works, but must confess that we have all we have by 
mercy alone. There is no more law nor wrath as before, 
when he terrified the Jews to flee, and they did not thirst 
at the mountain [Ex. 19:16, 20, 19]. He no longer drives 
us and beats us, but deals with us in the most friendly 
way, makes us new, and does not give us to do one work 
or two, but creates in us a new birth and a new being, 
so that we become something different than before we 
were Adam's children; namely, planted out of Adam's 
inheritance into the inheritance of God, that God is our 
Father, we are His children, and thus also heirs of all the 
goods that He has. 

(15) Behold, so bravely does the Scripture deal with 
this thing, all is alive, not useless theidings, 2) with which 
we deal. Because we are born again, children of God 
and heirs, we are equal to St. Paul, St. Petro, Our Lady 
and all the saints in dignity and honor; for we have the 
treasure and all the goods of God just as abundantly as 
they. For they also had to be born again, like us, so they 
have no more than all Christians.

969 








To a living hope through the 
resurrection of JEsu Christ from the dead. 


(16) The reason we live on earth is not that we should 
also help other people, otherwise it would be best for 
God to strangle us and let us die as soon as we were 
baptized and had begun to believe. But that is why he 
lets us live here, so that we may also bring other people 
to faith, as he has done for us. But because we are on 
earth, we must live in hope. For although we are sure 
that through faith we have all the goods of God (for faith 
certainly brings with it the new birth, childship, and 
inheritance), yet you do not yet see it; therefore it is still 
in hope, set aside a little, so that we cannot see it with 
our eyes. This is what he calls the hope of life; this is a 


Hebrew way of speaking, as when one says: homo 


peccati. We say: "A living hope", that is, in which we may 
certainly hope and be sure of eternal life. But it is hidden, 
and still a cloth is drawn over it, that it may not be seen. 
It can now only be grasped with the heart and through 
faith, as St. John writes in a fine epistle, 1 John 3:2: "We 
are now the children of God, and it has not yet appeared 
to us that we shall be; but we know that when it shall 
appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He 
is." For this life and that life cannot bear one another, nor 
can they stand together, that we may eat, drink, sleep, 
watch, and do other natural works which this life entails, 
and be blessed at the same time. Therefore, we cannot 
come to live forever unless we have died and this life 
passes away. Thus, while we are here, we must stand in 
hope until God wills that we see the goods that we have. 

(17) But by what do we attain to the living hope? 
"Through the resurrection of Christ from the dead," he 
says. | have often said that no one should believe in God 
in such a way that he would do it without means. 
Therefore, we cannot act before God by ourselves, for 
we are all children of wrath [Eph. 2:3], but we must have 
another through whom we come before God. 





who will stand for us and reconcile us to God. There is 
no other mediator than the Lord Christ, who is the Son 
of God. Therefore this is not a true faith, as the Turks and 
Jews believe: | believe that God created heaven and 
earth. So the devil also believes, but does not help him. 
For they dare to come before God without Christ, the 
mediator. Therefore St. Paul says Rom. 5, 1. 2.: "We 
have access to God through faith", not through 
ourselves, but "through Christ". Therefore, we must bring 
Christ, come with Him, pay tribute to God with Him, and 
do everything through Him and in His name that we want 
to do with God. This is also what St. Peter means here, 
and thus wants to say: We are certainly waiting for life, 
even though we are still here on earth. But all this is not 
otherwise than through the resurrection of Christ, 
because he rose from the dead and ascended to 
heaven, and sits at the right hand of God. For this is why 
he ascended, that he might give us his Spirit, that we 
might be born again, and that now through him we might 
come to the Father, saying, Behold, | come before thee, 
and pray; not altogether that | should rely upon my 
prayer, but that my Lord Christ should stand for me, and 
be my Advocate. These are all fiery words where there 
is a heart that believes; where there is not, it is all cold, 
and does not go to the heart. 

18) From this, however, one can judge what a 
righteous Christian doctrine or sermon is. For if one is to 
preach the gospel, it must be, in short, about the 
resurrection of Christ. He who does not preach this is not 
an apostle, for this is the main part of our faith. And these 
are the righteous, noblest books, which teach and 
practice such things most, as is said above [§ 12). 
Therefore it can be felt that the epistle of Jacob is not a 
true apostolic epistle, 2) because there is almost no letter 
in it about these things. The greatest power lies in this 
article of faith. For if it were not for the resurrection, we 
would not have any

comfort nor hope, and the rest all that Christ did and 
suffered would be in vain [1 Cor. 15:17.]. Therefore let it 
be taught: Behold, Christ died for thee, and took upon 
him sin, and death, and hell, and was laid under them; 
but nothing could oppress him, because he was too 
strong; but he rose again under them, and overcame all 
these things, and brought them under himself; and that 
for this cause thou mightest be delivered from them, and 
become a ruler over them. If you believe this, you have 
it. We cannot do all this with our own ability; that is why 
Christ had to do it, otherwise he could not have come 
down from heaven. Therefore it is no different when we 
preach about our works, because this preaching does 
not come to pass and cannot be understood. Oh, how 
we Christians should know this so well, how the epistle 
should be so clear to us! 


To an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and 
unfading. 


19 That is, we do not hope for the good or inheritance 
which is not present, but we live in the hope of an 
inheritance which is present, and which is imperishable, 
and also undefiled and unfading. We have the 
inheritance eternally without end, but we do not see it 
now. These are mighty and excellent words; to whom 
this comes to mind, he will not (I think) ask much about 
temporal goods and pleasures. How can it be possible 
for someone to be attached to temporal goods and 
pleasures, if he certainly believed that? For if one holds 
the worldly good against this, one sees how it all passes 
away and only lasts for a time; but this alone remains 
eternal, is not consumed. In addition, all these things are 
unclean and defile us, for there is no man so pious whom 
temporal goods do not defile; but this inheritance alone 
is pure: he who has it is eternally undefiled. Nor does it 
wither, wither, or rot. All that is on earth, though it be hard 
as iron and stone, yet it is changeable, and endureth not. 
A man, as soon as he 1) grows old, so he is ugly. "But 
that does not change, remains fresh forever and

green. On earth there is no pleasure so great that it does 
not wear out, as we see that one gets tired of everything; 
but this good is not so. We have all this in Christ, through 
God's mercy, if we believe it, and it is given to us freely. 
For how should we poor people by our works be able to 
earn such great good, which no human reason nor 
sense can comprehend? 


Keeping that is in heaven upon you. 


(20) Surely the inheritance, imperishable, undefiled, 
and unfading, is ours; it is only now hidden for a little 
while, until we shut our eyes, and let ourselves be 
embraced; then we shall surely find it, and see it, if we 
believe. 


V. 5: Who through the power of God are kept in 
faith unto salvation. 


(21) We are waiting for the precious inheritance (he 
says) in the hope into which we have come through faith. 
For so it goes one after another: from the word follows 
faith; from faith the new birth; from the birth we enter into 
hope, that we may wait and be sure of the good things. 
That is why Peter spoke in a Christian way, that it must 
be by faith and not by works. 

22) But actually St. Peter says here: "You are 
preserved to salvation by the power of God", because 
many people, when they hear the gospel, how faith 
alone without all works makes them godly, plump down 
and say: Yes, | also believe; thinking that their thought, 
which they themselves make, is faith. Now we have 
been taught from Scripture that we cannot do the least 
3) works without the Spirit of God; how then can we by 
our powers do the highest work, that is, believe? 
Therefore, such thoughts are nothing else but a dream 
and imaginary thing. God's power must be there and 
work in us to make us believe, as Paul also says Eph. 
1, 17. ff, "God give you the spirit of wisdom, that you may 
know which is the

973 








the exceeding greatness of his power in us who have 
believed, according to the effect of his mighty strength" 
2c. Not only is it God's will, but it is also God's power 
that He makes it cost Him much. For when God creates 
faith in man, it is as great a work as if He created heaven 
and earth again. 

(23) Therefore the fools know not what they say, who 
say: Well, how can faith alone do it? Some believe, but 
they do not do good works. For they think that their own 
dream is faith, and that faith may well be without good 
works. But we Say, as Peter says, that faith is the power 
of God. Where God works faith, man must be born again 
and become a new creature; naturally, good works must 
follow from faith. Therefore, one must not say to a 
Christian who believes, "Do this or that work," for he is 
doing good works of his own accord. But this must be 
said to him, that he deceive not himself with false, 
imaginary faith. Therefore let the rag-washers 1) go, 
who can speak much of it, which is nothing but foam and 
useless talk, of whom also Paul says 1 Cor. 4:19, 20: "I 
will come to you, and will not ask for the words of the 
puffed-up, but for the power. For the kingdom of God is 
not in words, but in power." Now where this power of 
God is not, there is neither righteous faith nor good 
works. Therefore, they are vain liars who boast of the 
Christian name and faith, and yet lead an evil life. For if 
it were God's power, they would be different. 

(24) What is this that St. Peter says: You are 
preserved by the power of God unto salvation? This is 
what he means by it: "Such a tender and precious thing 
is faith, which the power of God (which is with us and of 
which we are full) works in us, to give us a right and clear 
understanding of all things that pertain to salvation, that 
we may judge all things that are on earth, and say: This 
doctrine is righteous, this is 


1) In Latin: Istos innnitsr Anrrutos. 


false; this life is right, that is not; this work is good and 
well done, that is evil. And what such a man concludes 
is right and true; for he cannot be deceived, but is 
preserved and kept, and remains a judge over all 
doctrine. 

(25) Again, where faith and this power of God are not, 
there is nothing but error and blindness; reason is led 
back and forth from one work to another, because it 
would gladly go to heaven by its works, and always 
thinks: This work will take you to heaven; do this and you 
will be saved. That is why there are so many 
monasteries, convents, altars, priests, monks and nuns 
in the world. God lets the unbelievers fall into such 
blindness. But for us who believe, he keeps us in a right 
mind, so that we do not fall into condemnation, but come 
to blessedness. 


What bliss is ready to be revealed at the last time. 


(26) That is, the inheritance to which you have been 
assigned has long been acquired and prepared from the 
beginning of the world, but now it lies hidden, still 
covered, closed and sealed. But it is to be done in a little 
while, and in a moment it will be opened and uncovered 
for us to see. 


V. 6 In which you will rejoice, who now for a little 
while (where it is to be) are sorrowful in many a 
temptation. 


(27) If thou art a Christian, and waitest for the 
inheritance or salvation, thou must hold to this alone, 
and despise all that is on earth, and confess that all 
worldly reason, wisdom, and holiness are nothing. The 
world will not be able to bear this; therefore you must 
consider that you will be condemned and persecuted. 
Thus St. Peter sums up faith, hope, and the holy cross; 
for one follows from the other. 

28 And he also gives us comfort when we suffer and 
are persecuted. The mourning will last a little while, but 
after that you will rejoice, for blessedness has already 
been prepared for you.

975 





your sufferings. This is also a true Christian comfort, not 
like the comfort of human teachings, which do not seek 
more than how to find help from outward misfortune. | 
do not add bodily comfort (he says); it does no harm that 
you must have outward misfortune; only go up fresh, 
and hold fast; do not think how you will be rid of 
misfortune, but think thus: My inheritance is already 
prepared and present, is to be done for a short time, the 
suffering must soon cease. So we should set aside 
temporal consolation and set against it the eternal 
consolation that we have in God. 

29 It is also to be noted here that the apostle adds: 
"Where it should be. As he will also say afterwards in 
chapter 3, v. 17: "If it is the will of God". There are many 
people who want to storm heaven and soon enter it; 
therefore they put a cross on themselves at their own 
discretion. For reason always wants to put up only its 
own works. God does not want that, it should not be our 
own works that we choose, but we should wait for what 
God lays out and sends to us, so that we go and follow 
as He leads us; therefore you must not run after it 
yourself. If it should be so, that is, if God sends you to 
do it, accept it and take comfort in the blessedness that 
is not temporal but eternal. 


V. 7.8. that the proving of your faith (or, that your 
proven faith) may be found much more precious 
than the perishable gold that is proved by fire, to 
praise, glory and honor, when Jesus Christ is 
revealed, whom you have not seen, and yet love, in 
whom also you believe, and yet do not see. 


(30) For this purpose the cross and all kinds of 
adversity are to be used, so that the false faith and the 
righteous faith may be separated. God therefore attacks 
us so that our faith may be proven and made manifest 
before the world, so that other people may also be 
provoked to faith, and we may also be praised and 
glorified. For as we praise God, so He will praise, glorify 
and honor us again; then the false hypocrites will be put 
to shame who do not go about it in the right way. 


The whole of Scripture compares temptation to fire; 
so here St. Peter also compares gold, which is proved 
by fire, to the proving of faith through temptation and 
suffering. The fire makes the gold no less; but it makes 
it pure and clean, so that all addition comes from it. God 
has therefore laid the cross on all Christians, so that they 
may be cleansed and swept clean, so that faith may 
remain pure, just as the word is pure, so that people may 
cling to the word alone and not trust in any other thing. 
For we have daily need of such sweeping and such a 
cross, because of the old, coarse Adam. 

(32) Thus it is for a Christian life to increase and 
become more and more pure. When we come to faith 
through the preaching of the gospel, we become godly 
and begin to be clean; but because we are still in the 
flesh, we can never be completely clean. Therefore God 
throws us into the midst of the fire, that is, into suffering, 
shame and misfortune, so that we are swept away more 
and more until we die. To this we cannot come with any 
works. For how can an outward work make the heart 
inwardly pure? When faith is thus proved, all that is 
additional and false must depart and fall away. Glorious 
honor, praise and glory will follow when Christ is 
revealed. Therefore follows: 


V. 8. 9. But for faith's sake you will rejoice with 
joy unspeakable and glorious, and will bring the end 
of your faith, that is, the blessedness of your souls. 


(33) An inexpressible, glorious joy it shall be (says St. 
Peter), of which one has honor and glory. The world has 
such joy, of which one has nothing but shame, and of 
which one must be ashamed. St. Peter spoke clearly 
about the future joy, and there is hardly such a clear 
saying in the Scriptures about the future joy as here, and 
yet he cannot express it. This is a part of the preface, in 
which the apostle indicated what faith in Christ is, and 
how it is to be proven and purified through the adversity 
and suffering that God sends us. Now follows how this 
faith is recorded and promised in Scripture.

W. IX, 649-681. 





V.10-12. For what blessedness the prophets 
prophesied concerning the grace that was to come 
upon you, seeking and searching for what and to 
what time the Spirit of Christ which was in them 
pointed, and testified beforehand of the sufferings 
which are in Christ, and of the glory afterward to 
whom it was revealed. For they presented it not unto 
themselves, but unto us; which is now made known 
unto you by them that preached the gospel unto you, 
sent down from heaven by the Holy Ghost; which 
also the angels longed to behold. 


Here St. Peter refers us back to the holy Scriptures, 
so that we may see how God keeps what He promised 
us for 1) no merit's sake, but by grace alone. For the 
whole of Scripture is designed to tear us from our works 
and bring us to faith. And it is necessary that we study 
the Scriptures carefully, so that we may be sure of faith. 
St. Paul also leads us into the Scriptures, where he says 
Rom. 1, 2, that God promised the gospel beforehand 
through the prophets in the Holy Scriptures; item, Rom. 
3, 21, that the faith by which one is justified is attested 
through the law and the prophets. So we also read 
Apost. 17, 2. f., how Paul preached the faith to the 
Thessalonians, led them into the Scriptures and 
expounded them to them, and how they went back to the 
Scriptures daily and searched whether it was as Paul 
had taught them [Apost. 17, 11.). Therefore we should 
also do so, that we run behind and learn to base the New 
Testament on the Old. Then we will see the promise of 
Christ in it; as Christ Himself says John 5:39: "Search 
the Scriptures, for it is they that testify of Me." Item, v. 
46: "If you believed Mosi, you also believed me, for he 
wrote of me." 

35 For this reason we should abandon the idle talkers 
who despise the Old Testament and say that it is no 
longer necessary, when it is from it alone that we must 
take the foundation of our faith. For God sent the 
prophets to the Jews for this purpose, that they might

were to bear witness to the future Christ. For this reason 
the apostles have also convicted and overcome the 
Jews everywhere from their own Scriptures, that this is 
Christ. Thus the books of Moses and the prophets are 
also the gospel, since they preached and described the 
same things about Christ that the apostles preached or 
wrote afterwards. 

(36) But there is a difference between them. For 
though both are written on paper in the letter, yet the 
gospel or New Testament is not really to be written, but 
put into the living voice, that it may resound, and be 
heard throughout the world. The fact that it is also written 
is due to abundance. But the Old Testament is written 
only in the Scriptures, and therefore it is called a letter. 
And so the apostles call it the Scripture, because it alone 
pointed to the future Christ. But the gospel is a living 
preaching of Christ who is to come. There is also a 
difference among the books of the Old Testament. First 
of all, the five books of Moses are the main part of the 
Scriptures and are actually called the Old Testament. 
After them are also the books of history, in which are 
written all kinds of examples of those who kept or did not 
keep the law of Moses. Third are the prophets, who are 
based on Moses, and what he has written, further and 
with clearer words have struck out and explained. But it 
is one opinion of all prophets and Moses. 

(37) Now that it is said how the Old Testament is 
abolished and thrown back, understand it thus. First, 
there is the difference between the Old and New 
Testaments, as we have now said, that the Old pointed 
to Christ, but the New now gives us that which was 
promised before in the Old, and was signified by the 
figures. Therefore the figures are now abolished, 
because what they served for is now completed and 
fulfilled what was promised in them. Now therefore there 
shall be no more distinction of meat, or of raiment, or of 
place, or of time: for all things are alike in Christ, unto 
whom 2) all things are directed. 


2) In the old editions: in.

was. The Jews were not saved by it, for it was not given 
to them to make them godly, but to model for them the 
Christ who was to come. 

(38) In the Old Testament, God had two kinds of rule, 
an outward and an inward rule. He took it upon himself 
to govern the people, both inwardly in the heart and 
outwardly in the body and in the goods. That is why he 
gave them so many laws mixed together. So this was a 
physical rule, that a man would give his wife a letter of 
divorce if he did not want her, and put her away [Deut. 
24:1]. But to the spiritual regiment belongs the 
commandment [Deut. 19, 18]: "Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself." But now he reigns in us only 
spiritually, through Christ. But the bodily and outward 
government he directs through the worldly authorities. 
Therefore, when Christ came, the outward things were 
abolished; God no longer ordained outward persons, 
times and places for us, but governed us spiritually 
through the Word, so that we are masters over all 
outward things and are not bound to any bodily thing. 
But what belongs to the spiritual rule is not abolished, 
but still stands, as there are the laws in Moses about the 
love of God and the neighbor; which God still wants to 
have kept, and will condemn all unbelievers by the law. 

(39) For this also the figures remained spiritual, that 
is, that which is spiritually signified by the outward 
figures, though it is outwardly abrogated. So that a man 
divorced his wife and let her go because of adultery, that 
is a figure and meaning that is now also spiritually 
fulfilled. For so God also rejected the Jews, because 
they would not believe in Christ, and chose the Gentiles. 
Item, so he still does, if someone does not want to walk 
in faith, he lets him out of the Christian community, so 
that he is better. Likewise also [Deut. 25:5, 6], that a 
woman after her husband's death should take her 
husband's brother, and beget children by him, and he 
should be called after him, and sit in his goods. This, 
although it has now ceased, or even become free, that 
one may do it without sin. 





979 


or not, it is nevertheless a figure that also points to 
Christ. For he is our brother, died for us and ascended 
into heaven, and commanded us to make souls 
pregnant and fruitful through the gospel; so that we keep 
his name, are called after him, and also enter into his 
goods. Therefore | must not boast that | convert people, 
but must ascribe it all to the Lord Christ. It is the same 
with all the other figures of the Old Testament, which 
would be too long to tell. 

40 Thus everything that is not external to the Old 
Testament, such as all the sayings of the prophets 
concerning faith and love, still stands; therefore Christ 
also confirms Matth. 7:12: "All things whatsoever ye 
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: 
this is the law and the prophets. In addition, Moses and 
the prophets are also witnesses of the future Christ. So 
when | preach about Christ, that he is the only Savior, 
through whom everyone must be saved, | may take 
before me the saying Genesis 22:18: "In your seed shall 
all the Gentiles be blessed." From this | make a living 
voice, and say: Through Christ, who is Abraham's seed, 
all men must be blessed. From this it follows that in 
Adam we are all cursed and damned; therefore it is 
necessary that we believe in the seed, if we want to 
escape damnation. From such sayings we must lay a 
foundation of our faith, and let them remain, that we may 
see in them how they testify of Christ, that faith may be 
strengthened thereby. This is what St. Peter wants with 
these words when he speaks: 


V. 10: For what blessedness the prophets sought 
and searched, who prophesied of the grace to come 
upon you. 


41 Paul also speaks in this way in Romans 16:25, 26: 
"After the discovery of the mystery, which was kept 
secret from the beginning of the world, but has now been 
revealed and made known through the Scriptures of the 
prophets. And so you will find in the New Testament 
many sayings taken from the prophets, so that the 
apostles can prove that everything happened in this 
way. 


980 Eni. si, 349-351. First edition. Sermon on | Petr. 1, 10-12. 


W. ix, 554-557. 981 





is as the prophets prophesied. So Christ himself proves 
it Matth. 11, 5. from the prophet Isaiah [Cap. 35, 5. 6.]: 
"The blind see, the lame walk" 2c. As if he wanted to say: 
As it is written there, so it goes there. Item, so we read 
Apost. 9, 22. by Paulo, and Cap. 18, 28. by Apollo, how 
they drove in the Jews, and proved by the Scriptures that 
this was the Christ. For what the prophets had 
proclaimed, all this had now come to pass concerning the 
Christ". Item, Apost. 15, 14. ff. the apostles prove how the 
gospel had to be preached to the Gentiles so that they 
would believe. All this took place, and the Jews were 
transferred and had to confess that it was just as the 
Scriptures had said before. 


V.11. And have inquired what time and what 
manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them 
pointed to. 


Thus St. Peter says: "Although the prophets did not 
actually know a certain and definite time, yet they 
generally indicated all the circumstances of the time and 
place, such as how Christ would suffer and die, and how 
the Gentiles would believe in him, so that one could 
certainly know by the signs when the time would be. 
Daniel the prophet came near, but still spoke obscurely 
of when Christ would suffer and die, when this or that 
would happen. Item, so they had a certain prophecy that 
the kingdom of the Jews should end before Christ came; 
but the day and certain time when this should happen 
was not determined. For it was sufficient, when that time 
should come, that they should then know assuredly that 
Christ was not far off. So the prophet Joel also 
prophesied of the time when the Holy Spirit would come, 
saying [Cap. 3:1], "In the last days | will pour out of my 
Spirit upon all flesh." 2c. . Which saying St. Peter 
indicates Apost. 2, 17. and proves that he just spoke of 
the time and certain persons. 

43) From all this you see how with great diligence the 
apostles have always been able to establish and prove 
their authority. 


We have shown our disobedience to their preaching and 
teaching. So now the concilia and the pope approach, 
and only want to deal with us without scripture, and 
command by obedience of the church, and by the ban, 
that we believe them. The apostles were full of the Holy 
Spirit, and were sure that they were sent by Christ, and 
preached the true gospel; yet they threw themselves 
down, and would not have them believed, unless they 
proved it thoroughly from the Scriptures, that it was so, 
as they said, that the mouths of the unbelievers also 
might be shut, that they could not raise anything against 
it. And we should believe the coarse, unlearned heads, 
who preach no word of God at all, and can do no more 
than cry out forever: Yes, the fathers could not have 
erred, and has long been thus decreed, therefore one 
must not give an account of it. We can certainly prove 
this from the Scriptures, that no one will be saved except 
he who believes in Christ, so that they can say nothing 
against it; but they will not prove their deed to us with 
Scriptures, that he will be condemned who does not fast 
on this or that day; therefore we do not want to and 
should not believe them. Now St. Peter goes on to say: 


Which Spirit testified beforehand of the sufferings 
that are in Christ, and of the glory afterward to whom 
it is revealed. 


44 This may be understood of the two kinds of 
suffering that Christ and we suffer. St. Paul also calls all 
Christians suffering the suffering of Christ [Col. 1, 24]. 
For as the faith, the name, the word, and the work of 
Christ are mine, because | believe in him; so also his 
suffering is mine, because | also suffer for his sake. So 
the suffering of Christ is fulfilled daily in Christians until 
the end of the world. This is our comfort in all suffering, 
that we know that everything we suffer is common in 
Christ, so that he counts it all for his own suffering, and 
that we are sure that as soon as suffering is over, glory 
will follow. But we must also know that just as Christ did 
not come to glory before suffering, so we must also bear 
the cross with him beforehand, so that we may have joy 
with him afterwards. 

45. all that we now preach speaks 


982 En. 51, 351-353. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. w. IL, 657-659. 


he prophets of old proclaimed clearly and said it 
beforehand, because the Holy Spirit revealed it to them. 
But that we now understand the prophets so little is 
because we do not understand the language; otherwise 
they have spoken clearly enough. Therefore, those who 
know the language and have God's Spirit, which all 
believers have, do not have difficulty understanding, 
since they know where all Scripture reaches. But if one 
does not hear their language, and does not have the 
spirit or Christian understanding, then it can be seen as 
if the prophets were drunk and full of wine. However, 
where one should lack one, better is the spirit without the 
language than the language without the spirit. The 
prophets have a peculiar way of speaking, but they mean 
just what the apostles preach, for they have both spoken 
much, 1) of the passion and glory of Christ, and of those 
who believe in him. As when David speaks of Christ, Ps. 
22:7, "| am a worm, and not a man," so that he indicates 
how deeply he is cast down and humbled in his suffering. 
Item, so he also writes of his people and the repugnance 
of the Christians, Psalm 44, 23: "We have been regarded 
as sheep for slaughter. 


V. 12 For they presented it not to themselves, but 
to us; which is now preached unto you by them which 
preached the gospel unto you, sent down from heaven 
by the Holy Ghost. 

(46) That is, the prophets were satisfied in this, that 
they knew it; but when they left it behind them, they did 
it for our love, and became our servants, and so served 
us, that we might go to school with them, and learn the 
same also. Now we have a reason, that our faith may be 
the stronger, and that we may arm ourselves and protect 
ourselves against all false teaching. 


Which the angels also desire to behold. 


47. such great things the apostles have proclaimed to 
us through the Holy Spirit, who came from the 


1) "Both" is referred by Bucer (iitriyiis) to the prophets and the 
apostles, but it belongs to the following, and "they" is to be taken from 
"the prophets". This can be clearly seen from the second treatment of 
this epistle. 





983 


Heaven has come upon them, which even the angels 
love to see. Then he tells us to close our eyes and see 
what the gospel is, and we will have pleasure and joy 
from it. We cannot yet see it with our bodily eyes, but 
must believe that we are partakers and fellows of the 
righteousness, truth, blessedness and all the goods that 
God has. For since He has given us Christ, His only Son, 
the highest good, He also gives us through Him all His 
goods, riches and treasures, from which the angels in 
heaven take all pleasure and delight. All this is offered 
to us through the gospel, and if we believe, we must also 
have such pleasure in it. But our delight cannot be as 
perfect as the angel is, because we live on earth. Now it 
may well begin in us to feel something of it through faith, 
but in heaven it is so great that no human heart can 
comprehend it. But when we get there, we will also feel 
it. 

(48) So you see how St. Peter teaches us to arm 
ourselves with the Scriptures. And hitherto he hath 
written what is the gospel to preach, and how it was 
preached aforetime by the prophets, that it should thus 
be done and preached. Now he continues, exhorting us 
in this chapter to adhere to the same preaching of the 
gospel by faith, and to follow it by love, saying thus: 


Therefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be 
sober, and with all your mind set your hope on the 
grace that is offered to you by the revelation of Jesus 
Christ, as children of obedience, not like the former 
lusts of your ignorance, but according to Him who 
called you and made you holy, you also be holy in all 
your conduct, according to which it is written, "You 
shall be holy, for I am holy. 

49) This is an exhortation to faith, and this is the 
opinion: Because these things have been preached to 
you and given to you through the gospel, that 3) the 
angels also rejoice, and that 

2) gleichbertig - of the same form, of the same donor. Cf. § 61 of 


this chapter.

IX, 659-662. 985 





Therefore hang on to it, and put your trust in it with all 
your mind, so that it may be a righteous faith, and not a 
dyed or made-up delusion and dream. 


V. 13. Gird up the loins of your mind. 


50 Peter speaks of a spiritual girding of the mind, as 
a man bodily girds his sword on his loins. Christ also 
spoke of girding, Luc. 12, 35, when he said, "Let your 
loins be girded." In some places in Scripture "loins" are 
called unchastity, bodily; but here St. Peter speaks of 
spiritual loins. After the body the Scripture calls the loins, 
since the natural birth comes from the Father. So we 
read in Gen 49:10, 1) that from the loins of Judah Christ 
was to come. So the bodily girding of the loins is nothing 
else than chastity, as Isaiah Cap. 11, 5. says: 
"Righteousness shall be a girdle to his loins, and faith a 
girdle to his kidneys"; that is, by faith alone one restrains 
and constrains evil desire. But the spiritual girding (of 
which the apostle says here) goes like this: As a virgin is 
bodily pure and incorrupt, so the soul is spiritually 
incorrupt through faith, by which it becomes Christ's 
bride. But if it falls from faith to false doctrine, it must be 
put to shame. Therefore Scripture everywhere calls 
idolatry and unbelief adultery and fornication, that is, 
when the soul clings to the doctrines of men, and thus 
lets faith and Christ fall away. This is what St. Peter 
means here, when he calls us to gird up the loins of our 
minds, as if to say, "You have now heard the gospel and 
have entered into the faith; therefore take care that you 
remain in it and do not allow yourselves to be led astray 
by false teaching, so that you do not waver and run to 
and fro with works. 

(51) And here he speaks in a peculiar way, not as St. 
Paul speaks when he says, "The loins of your mind. 
"Mind" is what we call "being minded." As when | say, 
"This seemeth me right"; and as St. Paul speaks Rom. 
3:28, "So we hold it," so we are minded. With this 


1) Gen. 49, 10. No mention is made of the loins, but Gen. 35, 11. 
(If. Ed.) 








He actually means faith, and thus wants to say: You have 
created a righteous mind, that one must be justified by 
faith alone; now stay in this sense, gird it well, hold fast 
to it, and do not let yourselves be torn away from it, so 
you will stand well. For many false teachers shall arise, 
and set up doctrines of men, to pervert your minds, and 
to loose the girdle of faith: therefore be warned, and take 
heed. The hypocrites, who stand on their works, and 
therefore walk in an honorable, fine life, are so minded 
that God must set them in heaven because of their 
works, are puffed up, and ride high, standing hard on 
their mind and conceit, like the Pharisee Luc. 18, 11. 12. 
Of whom also Mary says in the Magnificat [Luc. 1, 51.], 
since she uses the very word that is written here in Petro: 
"He has scattered those who are hopeful in the mind of 
their heart", that is, in their mind. 


Be sober. 


(52) Sobriety is external to the body and is the noblest 
work of faith. For even though a man has been justified, 
he is not yet completely free from evil desires. Faith has 
begun to subdue the flesh, but it is still stirring and raging 
in all kinds of lusts that want to come forth again and do 
its bidding. Therefore the spirit has to work daily to tame 
and subdue it, and must beat with it without ceasing, and 
take heed to the flesh, lest it repel faith. Therefore they 
deceive themselves who say they have faith and think 
that is enough, living according to their will. Where faith 
is righteous, it must attack the body and keep it in check, 
so that it does not do what it desires; therefore St. Peter 
says that we should be sober. 

But he does not want the body to be ruined or 
weakened too much, as many are found who have fasted 
and martyred themselves to death. St. Bernard was also 
for a time in such foolishness (although he was otherwise 
a holy man) that he broke off so much of his body that 
his breath was stinking, and he could not be with people; 
yet he came to the church. 


986 en. 51, 358-358. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 662-665. 


987 





Afterward he came out again, and he also forbade his 
brothers not to harm the body. For he saw that he had 
made himself unfit to serve his brethren. 1) Therefore St. 
Peter demands no more than that we should be sober, 
that is, break off from the body as far as we feel that it is 
still too horny. He does not determine a certain time how 
long one should fast, as the pope has done, but rather 
he instructs each one to fast in such a way that he 
always remains sober and does not load the body with 
gluttony, so that he may remain sane and sensible and 
see how much he needs to mortify the body. For it is not 
at all fitting to make a commandment of this for a whole 
multitude and congregation, since we are so unequal 
among ourselves; one strong, another weak in body, 
that one must break off much, another little, so that the 
body may remain healthy beside it, and able to do good. 

(54) But that the other company should fall in, and so 
go, that they cannot fast and eat flesh, is also not right; 
for these also do not grasp the gospel, and are of no 
more use than the others, doing no more than despising 
the commandment of the pope, and yet will not gird up 
their minds and spirits, as Peter says; leaving the body 
its will, that it may remain slothful and lecherous. It is 
good to fast, but fasting means not to give the body more 
food than it needs to keep it healthy, and to let it work 
and watch, so that the old donkey does not become too 
stubborn and go dancing on the ice and break a leg, but 
walk in a bridle and follow the spirit; not like those who 
fill themselves so full with fish and the best wine at once 
when they fast that their belly swells. 2) Here St. Peter 
means to be sober. And now says further: 


And with all your mind set your hope on the grace 
that is offered to you. 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. VII, 1950; vol. XII, 1300, § 18.

Mnorum. The 
Weimarsche Ausgabe, vol. XII, p. 283, note 3 distinguishes "té6nen"- 
to give a tone, and "dénen"-to swell. 


55 Christian faith is so skillful that it sets itself freely 
on God's word with complete trust, ventures freely on it, 
and goes joyfully. Therefore Peter says: "Then the loins 
of your mind are girded, and your faith is righteous, if you 
dare to do it, whatever it may be, good, honor, body or 
life. So he has described with these words a truly fine 
righteous and unsealed faith. It does not have to be a 
lazy and sleepy faith, and only a dream, but a living and 
active thing, that one gives oneself to it with all one's 
mind, and hangs on the word, God grant, it may go with 
us as it will, that we get through happiness and 
misfortune. When | am about to die, | have to consider 
Christ freshly, stretch out my neck freely, and defy the 
word of God, which cannot lie to me. Faith must go 
straight through, not be deceived, and put out of sight all 
things that it sees, hears, and feels. St. Peter demands 
such a faith, which does not stand in thoughts or words, 
but in such power. 

Secondly, St. Peter says: "Put your hope in the grace 
that is offered to you," that is, you have not earned the 
great grace, but it is offered to you freely. For the gospel 
which proclaims this grace we have not devised, nor 
invented, but the Holy Spirit sent it down from heaven 
into the world. But what is offered to us? That which we 
have heard above [§ 21 ff]: He that believeth on Christ, 
and holdeth fast to the word, hath him with all his goods, 
to be lord over sin, death, the devil, and hell, and is sure 
of eternal life. This treasure is brought to our door and 
put into our 3) bosom without our doing or earning, yes, 
unawares and without our knowledge or thought. 
Therefore, the apostle wants us to look forward to it with 
joy, because God, who offers us such grace, will 
certainly not lie to us. 


Through the revelation of Jesus Christ. 


God does not allow anyone to offer His grace except 
through Christ. Therefore 


3) In the old editions: "die schoB".

989 





No man can come before him without this mediator, as 
we have heard enough above [§ 18]. For he will hear no 
man, except he bring with him Christ his dear Son, whom 
he alone looketh upon, and for his sake they also that 
cleave unto him. Therefore he wants us to know the Son, 
as we have been reconciled to the Father through his 
blood, so that we may come before him. For to this end 
the Lord Christ came, taking on himself flesh and blood, 
and clinging to us, that he might obtain for us such grace 
from the Father. Thus all the prophets and patriarchs 
were also preserved and saved through such faith in 
Christ; for they all had to believe in the saying that God 
said to Abraham: "Through your seed shall all the 
Gentiles be blessed." Therefore, as we have said [§ 18), 
the faith of the Jews and Turks is not valid, and of those 
who stand on their works and' thereby want to go to 
heaven. So Peter says: "Grace is offered to you"; but 
"through the revelation of Jesus Christ", or (that we 
translate it more clearly) because Jesus Christ is 
revealed to you. 

(58) Through the gospel it is made known to us what 
Christ is, that we may know him, that he is our Savior, 
takes away sin and death from us, and helps us out of all 
misfortune, reconciles us to the Father, and makes us 
godly and blessed without our works. Whoever does not 
recognize Christ in this way must be lacking. For even 
though you already know that he is the Son of God, dead 
and risen, and seated at the right hand of the Father, you 
have not yet rightly recognized Christ, nor do he yet help 
you, but you must know and believe that he did it all for 
your sake, to help you. Therefore it is a useless thing 
what has been preached and taught in high schools, 
which have not known anything about this knowledge, 
and have come no further than to consider how painful 
the suffering was for the Lord Christ, and how he now 
sits idle in heaven, and has joy with himself; and thus 
only dry hearts remain, in which faith cannot come to life. 

The Lord Christ is not to stand for Himself, but is to 
be preached. 


that he is ours. Otherwise, what need would there have 
been for him to come to earth and shed his blood? Since 
he was sent into the world for this reason, as he said in 
John 3:17, that the world might be saved through him, 
he must have done what he was sent to do by the 
Father. For the sending and going forth from the Father 
is not to be understood according to the divine nature 
alone, but according to the human nature and his 
ministry. AS soon as he was baptized, this began, and 
accomplished that for which he was sent and came into 
the world, namely, that he should preach the truth, and 
that he should preach it unto us, 1) that whosoever 
believeth in him should be saved. So he revealed 
himself and made himself known, and offered grace to 
us himself. 


v.14.As children of obedience. 


60 That is, present yourselves as the obedient 
children. "Obedience" is the name of faith in the 
Scriptures. But the pope, with his high schools and 
monasteries, has also torn apart this little word for us 
and pointed to their lie, what is written about this 
obedience, as the saying 1 Sam. 15:22: "Obedience is 
better than sacrifice." For since they see that obedience 
is much praised in the Scriptures, they have taken it to 
themselves, that they may deceive the people, that they 
may think that theirs is the obedience of which the 
Scriptures speak. So they bring us from God's word to 
their lies, and to the devil's hearing. He who hears the 
gospel and God's word and believes in it is an obedient 
son of God; therefore, whatever is not God's word, 
trample it underfoot and do not turn away from it. 


Not equal to the previous lusts of your ignorance. 


(61) This is that you do not conduct yourselves as you 
did before, and that you are not seen in the way you 
were before. Before you were idolatrous, and lived in 
unchastity, gluttony, drunkenness, avarice, pride, anger, 
envy and hatred; this was an evil, heathenish nature and 
unbelief, and you have gone away in such a nature,

like the blind, have not known what you have done. Now 
put away this evil desire. 

62 Here you see how he blames ignorance for all the 
misfortunes that come from it. For where there is no faith 
and no knowledge of Christ, there remains all error and 
blindness, so that one does not know what is right and 
what is wrong. This is how it has been up to now; since 
Christ has perished and been obscured, error has set in; 
the question of how one could be saved has spread 
throughout the whole world. That is already a sign of 
blindness or ignorance, that the right understanding of 
faith has gone out, and no one knows anything about it 
anymore. That is why the world is so full of various sects, 
and everything has been divided, because everyone 
wants to make his own way to heaven. Out of misfortune 
we must always fall deeper into blindness, because we 
cannot help ourselves. That is why St. Peter says: "You 
have now been fooled enough; therefore, stop now, 
because you have now become knowledgeable and 
have come to a right understanding. 


V. 16. 16. But according to Him who called you 
and is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, as it 
is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. 


63 St. Peter cites a saying from the Old Testament, 
Deut. 19:2, where God says: "You shall be holy, for | am 
holy," that is, because | am your Lord and God, and you 
are my people, you shall also be as | am. For a true lord 
makes his people like him, and they walk in obedience, 
and do the will of the Lord. Therefore, as God our Lord 
is holy, so his people are also holy; therefore we are all 
holy if we walk by faith. The Scriptures do not speak 
much of dead saints, but of those who live on earth. So 
the prophet David boasts Ps. 86, 2: "Lord, keep my soul, 
for | am holy." 

(64) But our scholars have again perverted the 
saying, and say that the prophet had a special 
revelation, that he calls himself holy. In this way they 
themselves confess that they lack faith, and that the 
revelation is not true. 





991 


They do not have the revelation of Christ, otherwise they 
would feel it. For he who is a Christian feels such a 
revelation in himself, but those who do not feel it are not 
Christians. For he who is a Christian enters into the 
fellowship of all his goods with the Lord Christ. Since 
Christ is holy, he must also be holy, or deny that Christ 
is holy. If you are baptized, you have put on the holy 
garment, which is Christ, as Paul says [Gal. 3:27]. The 
word "holy" means that which is God's own, and due to 
Him alone, which we call "consecrated" in German. So 
Peter says: You have now given yourselves to God as 
your own. Therefore see to it that you are not led again 
into worldly lusts, but let God alone rule, live and work in 
you, and you will be holy as he is holy. 

So far he has described the grace that is offered to 
us through the gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, 
and has taught how we are to hold ourselves against it, 
namely, that we remain in a pure, unaltered sense of 
faith, so that we know that no work that we can do or 
think up can help us. Now when one preaches such 
things, reason goes and says, "Well, if that is true, then 
| must not do any good work;" and so the coarse heads 
fall upon it, and make a carnal liberty out of the Christian 
being, thinking that they should do what they will. They 
are met here by St. Peter, who comes before them and 
teaches how Christian freedom must be used against 
God alone. For there is nothing more necessary than the 
faith that | give God His glory and consider Him to be my 
God, that He is just, true and merciful. Such faith makes 
us free from sins and all evil. If | have given such things 
to God, what | then live, | live to my neighbor, to serve 
and help him. The greatest work that follows from faith is 
that | confess Christ with my mouth, testify to him with 
my blood, and put my life where it should be. God is not 
allowed to do this work either, but for this reason | should 
do it, so that my faith may be proven and made known, 
so that other people may also be brought to faith. After 
that, other works also follow, which must also all be 
directed so that | can 


992 Erl. 51, 362-365. First edit. Sermon on 1 Pet. 1, 15-17. 


to serve the neighbor; all of which God must work in us. 
Therefore it is not valid to raise a carnal being and do 
what we desire. This is why St. Peter speaks: 


V. 17-21. And since ye call upon the Father, who 
without respect of persons judgeth according to every 
man's work, conduct your walk, the time of your 
pilgrimage, with fear, knowing that ye are not 
redeemed with corruptible silver or gold, from your 
vain walk in the statutes of your fathers, but with the 
precious blood of Christ, as an innocent and 
unblemished Lamb, who, though provided before the 
beginning of the world, was revealed in the last times, 
for your sake, who through him believe in God, who 
raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that 
you may have faith and hope in God. 


66 Thus says St. Peter: You have now come to be 
children of God through faith, and he is your Father, and 
have obtained an inheritance in heaven that is 
imperishable (as he said above, v. 4); so now there is 
nothing left but to take away the cloth and to uncover 
what is now hidden; you must still wait until you see it. 
Forasmuch then as ye are come to the state that ye may 
cheerfully call God Father, yet is he so just that he giveth 
to every man according to his works, and regardeth not 
the person. 

Therefore, you must not think, even if you have the 
great name of a Christian or the Son of God, that he will 
spare you if you live without fear, and think it is enough 
that you boast of this name. The world judges according 
to the person, so that it does not punish everyone 
equally, and spares those who are friends, rich, beautiful, 
learned, wise and mighty; but God does not look at 
anyone, everything is equal to him, no matter how great 
the person may be. Thus in Egypt he smote to death the 
son of Pharaoh the king, as the son of a bad miller. For 
this reason the apostle wants us to take this judgment to 
God and to stand in fear, so that we do not boast about 
the title of Christianity and rely on it as if he would give 
us more credit for it. 





W. IX, 670-673. 993 


than other people. For this also deceived the Jews of old, 
who boasted that they were Abraham's seed and God's 
people. The Scripture makes no distinction according to 
the flesh, but according to the spirit. It is true that he 
promised that Christ would be born of Abraham, and a 
holy nation would come from him; but it does not follow 
that all who are born of Abraham are God's children. He 
also promised that the Gentiles would be saved, but did 
not say that he would save all the Gentiles. 

(68) But here a question arises: Since we say that 
God alone makes us blessed through faith, regardless of 
works, why does St. Peter say that he does not judge 
according to the person, but according to the works? 
Answer: What we have taught, how faith alone makes us 
justified before God, is undoubtedly true, since it is so 
clear from Scripture that it cannot be denied. Now that 
the apostle says here that God judges according to 
works is also true, but it must certainly be held that where 
there is no faith, there can be no good works; and again, 
that where there are no good works, there is no faith. 
Therefore join faith and good works together, so that in 
the two there may be the sum of the whole Christian life. 
How you live now, that is how it will be for you, according 
to which God will judge you. Therefore, even though God 
judges us by our works, it remains true that the works 
alone are the fruits of faith, by which one can see where 
there is faith or unbelief; therefore God will judge you by 
your works and convince you that you have believed or 
not believed. Just as a liar cannot be judged and 
condemned except from his words; nor is it evident that 
he does not become a liar by his words, but was a liar 
before he told a lie; for the lie must come from the heart 
into the mouth. 

(69) Therefore, understand this saying most simply, 
that works are fruits and signs of faith, and that God 
judges people by such fruits, which must surely follow, 
so that it may be seen publicly where faith or unbelief is 
in the heart. God will not judge you according to whether 
you area 


994 en! 51, 365-387. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. w. ix, 673-675. 


995 





If you are called a Christian or baptized, he will ask you: 
"If you are a Christian, tell me, where are the fruits so 
that you can prove your faith? 

Therefore, St. Peter says: "Since you have such a 
Father, who does not judge according to person, 
conduct your lives in fear during your pilgrimage; that is, 
fear the Father, not for the sake of chastisement and 
punishment, as unbelievers and the devil fear, but lest 
he abandon you and withdraw his hand, as a pious child 
fears lest he anger his father and do something that 
would not please him. God wants to have a good fear in 
us, so that we may beware of sins and serve our 
neighbor, because we live here on earth. 

A Christian, if he believes righteously, has all the 
goods of God, and is God's son, as we have heard. But 
the time he is still alive is only a pilgrimage; for the spirit 
is already in heaven through faith, by which he is lord 
over all things. For this reason God allows him to still live 
in the flesh, and the body to walk on earth, so that he 
may help other people and also bring them to heaven. 
Therefore we have no other use for all things on earth, 
except as a sojourner who goes through a field and 
comes to an inn, where he must lie down for the night, 
and takes only food and lodging from the host, does not 
say that the host's goods are his. So we must also deal 
with temporal goods as if they were not ours, and enjoy 
only as much of them as we need to maintain the body, 
helping our neighbor with the other. So the Christian life 
is only a night's lodging. For we have no lasting city here 
[Heb. 13:14], but must go where the Father is, that is, to 
heaven; therefore we should not live here in ease, but 
stand in fear, says St. Peter. 


V. 18. 19. And know that you have not been 
redeemed with corruptible silver or gold from your 
vain walk in the statutes of your fathers, but with the 
precious blood of Christ. 

(72) This shall provoke you, he saith, to the fear of 


God, wherein ye shall stand, to remember how much it 
hath been, that ye should not 


have been redeemed. Before you were citizens of the 
world and sat under the devil, but now God has torn you 
out of such a state and placed you in a different one, so 
that you are citizens in heaven, but strangers and 
sojourners on earth. And behold how great a reward 
God has bestowed upon you, and how great is the 
treasure that you have been bought and brought to be 
the children of God. Therefore, conduct yourselves with 
fear, and see to it that you do not despise these things 
and lose the precious treasure. 

What then is the treasure that we may be redeemed? 
Not perishable gold or silver, but the precious blood of 
Christ, the Son of God. The treasure is so precious and 
noble that no human sense and reason can comprehend 
that only a drop of this innocent blood would have been 
enough for all the sins of the world; nor did the Father 
want to pour out his grace on us so abundantly, and let 
it stand for so much, that he let his Son, Christ, shed all 
his blood, and gave us the treasure in its entirety. For 
this reason he does not want us to throw such great 
grace to the wind and consider it small, but to be moved 
to live with fear, so that this treasure will not be taken 
away from us. 

74 And here it is to be noted that St. Peter says: 
"Redeemed are ye from your vain walk in the statutes of 
your fathers. For with this he strikes to the ground all the 
supports on which we stand, and think that our thing 
must be right, because it has been so from time 
immemorial, and our forefathers have all so held, among 
whom also have been wise and pious men. For thus he 
says, "All that our fathers did and established was evil; 
what you learned from them 1) about God's service is 
also evil, that it cost the Son of God his blood to redeem 
people from it. Now what is not washed by the blood is 
all poisoned and cursed by the flesh. From this it follows 
that the more a man presumes to make pious and does 
not have Christ, that he only hinders himself more, and 
the deeper into blindness and wickedness he goes.

The first time, the first time, the first time, the first time, 
the first time. 

(75) The outward rude things are yet small compared 
to this, that they teach how to become godly by works, 
and to establish a worship according to our reason. For 
there the innocent blood is most profaned and 
blasphemed. The heathen sinned much more in 
worshipping the sun and the moon, which they 
considered to be the right worship, than in any other sin. 
Therefore, human piety is blasphemy, and the greatest 
sin a man can commit. This is also the way the world 
now behaves, and what it considers godliness and piety 
is worse in the sight of God than any other sin, such as 
being a priest or a monk, and what seems good in the 
sight of the world, but is without faith. Therefore, 
whoever does not want to obtain grace from God 
through the blood, had better never appear before God's 
eyes, for he will only anger His Majesty more and more. 


AS an innocent and unblemished lamb. 


76 Now Peter interprets the Scriptures, for it is a 
powerful and rich epistle, even though it is short. Now 
that he has spoken of the vain walk in fatherly statutes, 
he also finds many sayings in the prophets, as in the 
prophet Jeremiah, Cap. 16, 19: "The Gentiles shall 
come unto thee from the end of the world, saying: Our 
fathers have gone about with lies" 2c. As if St. Peter 
should say: The prophets also proclaimed that you 
should be redeemed from the paternal statutes. So he 
also wants to point us to the Scriptures here, since he 
says: "You are redeemed by the blood of Christ, as an 
innocent and unblemished lamb", and explains what is 
written in the prophets and Moses, as Isa. 53, 7."He was 
led as a lamb to the slaughter"; item, the figure of the 
paschal lamb in Exodus 12:3 ff; all of which he interprets 
here, saying, "The lamb is Christ; and as that should be 
unblemished, so is this also unblemished and innocent, 
whose blood is shed for our sins. 


V. 20. Who, though provided before the beginning 
of the world, is revealed in the last times. 





That is, we have not earned it, nor have we ever 
asked God to shed the precious blood of Christ for us; 
therefore we can boast of nothing. The glory belongs to 
no one but God alone; God has promised it to us without 
any merit on our part, and has also revealed or made 
known that which He has provided and decreed from 
eternity, before the creation of the world. In the prophets 
it was also promised, but it was hidden and not made 
public; but now, after the resurrection of Christ and the 
sending of the Holy Spirit, it has been publicly preached 
to the whole world. 

(78) Now this is the last time, as St. Peter says, 
wherein we are, now from the ascension of Christ until 
the last day. Thus the apostles and prophets, and Christ 
Himself also, call it the last hour; not that as soon as after 
Christ's ascension the last day should come, but 
because after this preaching of the gospel of Christ there 
should come no other, neither should it be revealed and 
explained any more than it has been explained and 
revealed. For one revelation has always gone out after 
another. Therefore God says 2 Mos. 6, 3: "My name, 
Lord, | have not made known to them." For the 
patriarchs, even though they knew God, did not at that 
time have such a public preaching of God as went out 
afterwards through Moses and the prophets. Now no 
more glorious and public preaching has come into the 
world than the Gospel. Therefore it is the last; all times 
have now passed away, but now at last it is revealed to 
us. 

79 Secondly, it is also not long after the end of the 
world, as St. Peter explains in 2 Ep. 3, 8, when he says: 
"One day is like a thousand years before the Lord, and 
a thousand years like one day. And so he wants to lead 
us from the account of this time, so that we may judge 
according to the sight of God; since it is the last time and 
already has an end; but what still remains is nothing 
before God. The blessedness is now already revealed 
and completed, but God leaves the world still longer, so 
that His name may continue to be honored and praised, 
even though it has already been revealed for itself in the 
most perfect way.

V. 21. For your sake, who through him believe in 
God, who raised him from the dead and gave him 
glory, that you might have faith and hope in God. 

(80) For our sake (he says) the gospel was revealed, 
for God and the Lord Christ had no need of it, but made 
it profitable for us to believe in him. And this not through 
ourselves, but through Christ, who stands for us against 
the Father, whom he raised from the dead to rule over 
all things; so that he who believes in him has all his 
goods, and through him ascends to the Father. So we 
have faith in God, and also a hope through the same 
faith: faith alone must make us blessed. But it must be 
faith in God, for if God does not help you, you are not 
helped. Therefore it is not enough if you have the 
friendship of all men, but you must have the friendship 
of God, so that you may boast that he is your father and 
you are his child, and that you trust him more than your 
physical father and mother, that he will help you in all 
your needs; and this only through the one Mediator and 
Savior, the Lord Christ. Such faith does not come from 
human powers 1) (he says), but God creates it in us, 
because Christ earned it with his blood; to whom he 
therefore gave the glory and put it at his right hand, so 
that he created faith in us by the power of God. 

So far we have heard how St. Peter admonishes us 
to gird up the loins of the mind, so that we may remain 
pure and live by faith; after which, since so much has 
been said, we should walk with fear and not rely on 
being called Christians, since God is such a judge that 
He does not inquire of anyone, judging one as well as 
another, without distinction of persons. Now he 
continues, and concludes the first chapter: 


V. 22-25. And chastise your souls by the obedience 
of the truth in the Spirit, to undyed brotherly love, 
and love one another fervently out of a pure heart, as 
those who 


1) Weimarsche: "menschlicher krefft". 


Again are born, not of corruptible seed, but of 
incorruptible, even of the living word of God, which 
abideth for ever. After whom all flesh is as grass, and 
all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass 
is withered, and the flower is fallen: but the word of 
the Lord abideth for ever. Now this is the word which 
is preached among you. 


The fruits that follow after faith, Paul tells Gal. 5, 22: 
"The fruits of the Spirit (he says) are love, joy, peace, 
longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, 
chastity. So here St. Peter also says fruit 2) of faith, 
namely, that we should make our souls chaste through 
obedience to the truth in the Spirit. For where faith is 
righteous, it casts the body under itself, and compels the 
lust of the flesh; and though it does not kill it, yet it makes 
it submissive and obedient to the Spirit, and keeps it in 
check. This is what St. Paul means when he speaks of 
the fruits of the Spirit. It is a great work that the Spirit 
should rule over the flesh, and tame the evil desire that 
is inborn in us from father and mother; for it is not 
possible without grace that we should live well in 
marriage, much less illegitimately. 

83 But why does he say, "Make your souls chaste"? 
He knows well that the lust of the flesh for baptism 
remains in us to the grave. Therefore it is not enough for 
one to abstain from the work, and remain a virgin 
outwardly, and let the evil desire remain in the heart, but 
one must strive for the soul to be chaste, so that it comes 
out of the heart, and the soul is free from evil desire and 
lust, and always beats itself with it, until it is rid of it. 

And here he adds a fine addition, that one should 
make the soul chaste "through obedience to the truth in 
the spirit. Much has been preached about chastity, and 
many books have been written about it; they have said 
that one should fast so long, one should not eat meat, 
one should not drink wine, 2c., that one may be rid of 
temptation. It has probably helped with something,

1001 





But it was not enough; it did not dampen the desire. So 
St. Jerome writes of himself, 1) that he had so prepared 
his body that he had become like a Moor; nevertheless 
it did not help, and he still dreamed how he was in Rome 
at the singing dance among the metzes. So St. Bernard 
also hurt him so badly and ruined his body so that he 
stank, as | said above [§ 53]. They had hard temptation, 
and thought they wanted to dampen it with external 
things; but because it is external, the plaster is only 
applied on the outside, not on the inside; therefore it is 
not enough that it dampens lust. 

But here St. Peter has given a proper remedy for it, 
namely the obedience of the truth in the spirit, as the 
Scripture also does in other places, as Isa. 11:5: "Faith 
shall be a girdle to his kidneys,” which is the proper 
plaster that girds the kidneys. It must come out from 
within, not from without; for it is grown in the blood and 
flesh, marrow and veins, not on the outside in the cloth, 
nor in the garment; therefore it is not advisable to 
dampen the desire with external things. The body can be 
weakened and killed with fasting and work, but evil 
desire cannot be driven out with it. But faith can dampen 
it and ward it off, so that it must leave room for the spirit. 
Thus also the prophet Zacharias Cap. 9, 17. says of a 
wine that Christ has, from which virgins grow, which he 
gives them to drink. The other wine tends to provoke evil 
desire; but this wine, that is, the gospel, curbs it and 
makes chaste hearts. This is what St. Peter says, that if 
one grasps the truth with the heart, and is obedient to it 
in the spirit, this is the right remedy, and the most 
powerful medicine for it; otherwise you will not find any 
that could thus quench all evil thoughts. For when this 
comes into the heart, the evil inclination soon goes 
away. Try it, whoever wants to, will find it, and those who 
have tried it Know it well. But the devil does not let 
anyone

easily come to grasp the word of God so that it tastes 
good to him; for he knows well how powerful it is to curb 
evil desires and thoughts. 

So now St. Peter wants to say: If you want to remain 
chaste, you must grasp the obedience of truth in the 
spirit, that is, one must not only read and hear the word 
of God, but grasp it in the heart. Therefore, it is not 
enough to preach or hear the gospel once, but one must 
always press on and continue. For such is the grace of 
the word, the more it is acted upon, the sweeter it 
becomes.’ Although it is always the same doctrine of 
faith, yet it cannot be heard too much where there are 
not impudent and raw hearts. Now the apostle adds: 


To undyed brotherly love. 


For what purpose should we live a chaste life? That 
we may be saved by it? No, but to serve our neighbor. 
What shall | do to ward off my sin? | should grasp the 
obedience of truth in the spirit, that is, faith in God's 
word. Why do | resist it? That | may be useful to others; 
for | must first tame the body and the flesh by the Spirit, 
and then | may be useful to others. Follow on: 


And love one another fervently from a 
pure heart. 


The apostles Peter and Paul distinguish between 
brotherly love and common love. Brotherhood is that 
Christians should all be like brothers and make no 
distinction among them. For since we all have one Christ 
in common. One baptism, one faith, one treasure, | am 
no better than you; what you have, | have also, and am 
as rich as you. The treasure is the same, though | may 
have it more abundantly than you, so that | have it lying 
in gold, but you in a poor cloth. Therefore, as we have 
in common the grace of Christ and all spiritual goods, so 
we also ought to have in common life and limb, goods 
and honor, that we may serve one another in all things. 

89. Now he speaks clearly, "In unconditional 
brotherly love." The apostles need the word 


1002 en. 51, 373-376. interpretations on the epistle of St. Peter. Epistle of St. Peter. w. 1x, 684-686. 


We have gladly seen that we would be called Christians 
and brothers among ourselves, but it would be a false, 
dyed or fictitious thing, and only glitter. We have set up 
much brotherhood in the world, but it is all lies and 
deception, which the devil has devised and brought into 
the world, which only fights against right faith and 
righteous brotherly love. Christ is mine as well as St. 
Bernard's; yours as well as St. Francis. If then one 
comes and says, | shall go to heaven if | am in this or 
that brotherhood, then say, It is a lie, for Christ cannot 
stand it, will have no other brotherhood but the common 
one which we all have among ourselves; then you come 
here, you fool, and want to set up one of your own. | 
would allow it to be made, not for the help of the soul, 
but that some would be united to put in and make a 
treasure, from which those who would be helped would 
be helped. 

90 Thus we Christians have all received one 
brotherhood in baptism; no saint has more of it than | 
and you. For just as much as he was bought, so much 
am | bought; God has given as much to me as to the 
greatest saint, except that he may have a better grasp 
of the treasure and a stronger faith than | do. Love, 
however, is greater than brotherhood, for it reaches out 
even to enemies, and especially to those who are not 
worthy of love. For as faith does its work when it sees 
nothing, so love also should see nothing, and do its work 
most where there seems nothing lovely, but only 
displeasure and hostility; where there is nothing that 
pleases me, | should for that very reason put up with it. 
And this should be done fervently, says St. Peter, with 
all my heart, as God loved us when we were not worthy 
of love. Now follows further: 


V. 23: When they were born again. 


91 Thirdly, this should be done because you are not 
what you were before (he says), but new men. This did 
not happen by works, but it required a birth. For the new 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. XIX, 444 ff. 





1003 


You cannot make a man, but he must grow or be born. 
Just as a carpenter cannot make a tree, but he himself 
must grow out of the earth, and just as we all were not 
made Adam's children, but were born that way, and have 
brought sin from our father and mother, so it cannot 
happen by works that we become God's children, but 
must also be born anew. This is what the apostle wants 
to say: Because you are now a new creature, you should 
now also keep yourselves differently and lead a new life; 
as you lived in hatred before, so you must now walk in 
love, however contrary. But how did the new birth 
happen? As follows: 


Not from perishable seed, but from imperishable 
seed, namely from the living Word of God, which 
abides forever. 


We are born again through a seed; for no thing grows 
otherwise, as we see, than through seed. Now if the old 
birth came from a seed, the new birth must also be from 
a seed. But what is the seed? Not flesh and blood. What 
is it? It is not perishable, but is an eternal word; that is all 
with one another, by which we live, food and meat. 2) 
But first of all he is the seed, by which we are born again, 
as he says here. 

Now how does this happen? So: God lets the word, 
the gospel, go out and the seed fall into the hearts of 
men. Where the seed sticks in the heart, the Holy Spirit 
is there and makes a new man, there becomes another 
man, other thoughts, other words and works. So you will 
be completely changed. Everything that you fled from, 
you seek, and what you sought before, you flee. Physical 
birth is like this: When a man has received seed, the 
seed is changed, so that it is no longer seed; but this is 
a seed that cannot be changed, it remains eternally. But 
he changes me, so that | am changed into him, and what 
is evil in me of my nature even passes away. Therefore 
it is ever a strange birth, and from a strange seed. Now 
St. Peter continues: 


2) Cf. cap. 2, § 6. 


1004 en. 51, 376-378. First edit. Sermon on I Petr. Le 24. 


V. 24, 25: After which all flesh is as grass, and all 
the glory of man as a flower of grass. The grass is 
withered, and the flower is fallen: but the word of the 
Lord abideth for ever. 


94 This saying is taken from the prophet Isaiah Cap. 
40, 6-8, where the prophet says: "Shout! What shall | 
shout? Shout thus: All flesh is grass, and all its glory like 
a flower of the field. The grass is withered and the flower 
has fallen away, but God's word abides forever." These 
words are led here by St. Peter. For this, as | have said 
[§ 76], is a rich epistle and well peppered with Scriptures. 
So now the Scripture says that God's word abides 
forever. That which is flesh and blood is perishable, as 
the grass when it is young, that therefore it flourishes. 
Item, if it is rich, mighty, wise and pious, and therefore 
green (which all belongs to the flower), the flower 
nevertheless begins to thorn. What is young and 
beautiful becomes old and ugly, what is rich becomes 
poor, and so on, and all must fall by the word of God. But 
this seed cannot perish. Now Peter concludes: 


This is the word that is proclaimed among you. 


95. as if to say: you must not open your eyes wide 
when you come to the word of God; 1) you have it before 
your eyes; it is the word that we preach. There you can 
curb all evil lusts with. You must not fetch it far; do not do 
more than catch it when it is preached. For it is so near 
that it can be heard, as Moses also says, Deut. 30:11 ff: 
"The word which | command thee is not far from thee, 
that thou shouldest go far to hear it, or ascend into 
heaven, or go over the sea: but it is near thee, even in 
thy mouth, and in thine heart.” It is soon spoken and 
heard, but when it comes into the heart, it cannot die or 
pass away, nor let thee die; so long as thou cleavest to 
it, so long shall it keep thee. So when | hear that Jesus 
Christ died, took away my sin, and purchased heaven for 
me, and gave me all that he has, | hear this

25. W. IX, 686-689. 1005 


Gospel. The word is soon gone when it is preached; but 
when it falls into the heart, and is grasped with faith, it 
can never fall away. No creature can overthrow this truth; 
the foundation of hell can do nothing against it, and even 
if | am already in the devil's jaws, if | can seize it, | must 
come out again, and remain where the word remains. 
Therefore he says: You must not wait for any other than 
that which we have preached. 

96 St. Paul also says, Rom. 1, 16:"lam not ashamed 
of the gospel, for it is the power of God that saves 
everyone who believes in it. The Word is a divine and 
eternal power. For though the voice or speech soon 
vanishes, yet the substance, that is, the understanding, 
the truth, which is written in the voice, remains. As when 
| put a cup to my mouth, in which the wine is put, | drink 
the wine into it, even though | do not put the cup down 
my throat with it. So also is the word that brings the voice; 
it falls into the heart and comes to life, yet the voice 
remains outside and passes away. Therefore it is a divine 
power, even God himself. For thus he speaks to Moses, 
Ex. 4, 12: "I will be in your mouth." And Ps. 81, 11: "Open 
your mouth wide", preach confidently, say it out until 
hungry, "I will fill you", | will speak enough there 
presently. Also Joh. 14, 6. Christ says: "| am the way, the 
truth and the life", whoever hangs on this is born of God 
[1 Joh. 5, 1.]. Thus the seed is our Lord God Himself. All 
this is to teach us how we cannot be helped by works. 
Even though the word is small and seems to be nothing, 
because it comes from the mouth, there is such an 
overwhelming power in it, that it makes those who are 
attached to it children of God, Joh. 1, 12. Our salvation is 
based on the high estate. 

97) This is the first chapter of this epistle, in which you 
see how masterfully St. Peter preaches and acts the 
faith; from this it can be seen that this epistle is the right 
gospel. 2) Now follows the other chapter, which will teach 
us how we should conduct ourselves in works toward our 
neighbor.

The other chapter. 


V. 1-5, Put away therefore all malice, and all guile, 
and hypocrisy, and hatred, and all speaking evil. And 
be greedy for the sensible, unadulterated milk, as the 
little children now born, so that you may grow up by 
it, if you have tasted otherwise that the Lord is kind, 
to whom you have come, as to the living stone, which 
is rejected by men, but is worthy and precious in the 
sight of God. And you also, as the living stones, build 
yourselves into a spiritual house, and into a holy 
priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to 
God through Jesus Christ. 


(1) Then he began to teach what the works and fruits 
of a Christian life should be. For we have often enough 
said how a Christian life consists of two things: faith 
toward God and love toward one's neighbor. Item, that 
the Christian faith is given in such a way, that 
nevertheless always, because we live, many evil desires 
remain in the flesh, since there is no saint who is not in 
the flesh. But what is in the flesh cannot be entirely pure. 
Therefore says St. Peter: Be ye therefore armed to 
beware of sins which still cling to you, and to contend 
against them for ever. For the worst enemies we have are 
in our bosom and in the midst of our flesh and blood, 
watching, sleeping and living with us, like an evil guest 
who has been invited into our home and cannot be got rid 
of. 

(2) Therefore, since by faith the Lord Christ is all 
yours, and you have obtained salvation and all his goods, 
let it henceforth be your duty to put away all malice, or all 
that is evil, and all guile, that is, that no one deal 
unfaithfully and falsely with another; as it has been said 
of the world, that the world is full of unfaithfulness, which 
is also true. We Christians, however, are not to act 
unfaithfully in this way, but sincerely and with a pure heart 
with people as against God, badly and rightly, so that no 
one misleads the other in selling, buying or vowing, and 
the like. 





3 St. Paul also says in Eph. 4:25, "Put away lies, and 
speak the truth every man to his neighbor. Truth is that 
yes is yes, and no is no. But hypocrisy is when one 
presents himself differently with outward gestures than 
he means; for there is much to be done to present 
oneself as one has it in his heart. A Christian should act 
in such a way that he may suffer all men to see and know 
what he thinks in his heart, so that in all his conduct and 
actions he thinks only to praise God and to serve his 
neighbor, and shuns no one, and that each one may be 
found in the depths of his heart as he is looked at, and 
not make a mirror fencing to shut people's mouths. 

4 Furthermore, St. Peter also says that one should 
put away hatred and after-talk. There he finely describes 
the common vices among people when they deal with 
each other. The after-talk is almost mean and frivolous, 
is soon done that no one notices it; therefore beware of 
it (he says), if you already have a spirit, that you may 
know what the fruits of the spirit are. 


V. 2. Be greedy for the sensible, unadulterated 
milk, as the now born little children. 


(5) Then he makes a likeness, saying, Ye are now 
born again by the word of God; therefore keep 
yourselves as the newborn babes, which seek no more 
than milk. As they seek the breasts and the milk, so you 
also should be eager for the word, seek it and have a 
desire for it, so that you may suck the sensible, 
unadulterated milk. 

(6) Again, these words are ambiguous: for he does 
not mean bodily milk, nor bodily seeking, as he does not 
speak of a bodily birth, but says of another milk, which is 
sensible, that is, spiritual, which one draws with the soul, 
which the heart must suck. This should be genuine, not, 
as one is wont to sell false goods. There is truly much 
need for this, and there is great need, 


1008 Eri. di, 380-382. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 2. 3. W. ix, 694-M. 


1009 





that the milk be given to the newborn and young 
Christians pure and not adulterated. But the milk is 
nothing but the gospel, which is also the seed, that we 
may conceive and be born, as we have approved above 
[Cap. 1, § 92. 93]. So it is also the food that feeds us 
when we grow up, is also the armor that we may arm 
ourselves and do evil, yes, it is all with one another. But 
the addition is man's doctrine, that the word of God may 
be counterfeited. Therefore the Holy Spirit wants every 
Christian to see what milk he is sucking and to learn to 
judge all doctrines for himself. 

7) But the breasts that give forth this milk and suckle 
the young children are the preachers in Christianity, as 
the bridegroom says to the bride, Shel 4:5: "You have 
two breasts, like two young girls. 1) They should have a 
clump of myrrh hanging around them, as the bride says 
to Hohel. 1, 13: "My beloved is like a clump of myrrh 
hanging between my breasts," that is, one should always 
preach Christ. The bridegroom must be mingled in the 
midst of the breasts, otherwise it is wrong, and the milk 
is adulterated, if one does not preach Christ purely. Now 
this is how it is: when one preaches that Christ died for 
us and saved us from sins, death and hell, that is as 
sweet as milk. But after that one must also preach the 
cross, that one may suffer as he did; this then is strong 
drink and strong wine. Therefore, Christians must first be 
given the softest food, that is, milk. For you cannot 
preach evil to them, but first preach Christ alone; who is 
not bitter, but is sweet and fat grace, and you must not 
yet bear any pain. This is the right, sensible and 
unadulterated milk. 

8 And here St. Peter has reached far into the 
Scriptures, as he is quite rich in writings. So in the Old 
Testament it is written, Ex. 23, 19. and Deut. 14, 21:"You 
shall not boil the kid, because it is at its mother's milk." 
Dear, why did God let write this? What 


1) In the second adaptation (like in our Bible) instead of: "Hinnlein" 
deer twins are found. 





Is he concerned that no kid should be put down because 
it still sucks milk? Therefore, that he wants to mean that 
St. Peter teaches here, and so much is said: Preach 
neatly to the young and weak Christians: let them feed 
well and become fat in the knowledge of Christ. Do not 
load them with strong doctrine, for they are still too 
young. But after that, when they become strong, let them 
be slaughtered and sacrificed on the cross. Thus we 
read also Deut. 24:5: If a man had lately taken a wife, he 
must not go to war the first year, lest he be slain, but be 
merry at home with his wife. All this is done so that those 
who are still young Christians 2) may be given their time 
and may be disciplined. When they are grown up, God 
leads them to the holy cross and lets them die like the 
other Christians; there the little goat is slaughtered. Now 
follows further: 


V. 2, 3: That by them ye might grow up, having 
tasted otherwise that the Lord is good. 


(9) It is not enough to hear the gospel once, but it 
must always be carried on, that we may grow up; after 
that faith is strong, after that every man must be provided 
and fed. But this is not said to those who have not heard 
the gospel; they know neither milk nor wine. Therefore 
he adds, "If ye have tasted otherwise, that the Lord is 
good:" as if to say, To him that hath not tasted it, it is not 
to his heart, neither is it sweet. But those who have 
tasted it, who always handle the food and the word, to 
them it tastes right and is sweet to them. 

(10) But it is tasted when | believe with my heart that 
Christ has given himself to me and has become my own, 
and my sins and misfortunes are his, and now his life is 
mine. If such things go to the heart, they are tasted. For 
how can | not have joy and gladness from it? | am so 
happy when a good friend gives me a hundred guilders. 
But he who does not take it to heart cannot rejoice. The

But those who are in mortal distress or who are 
oppressed by an evil conscience taste it best; hunger is 
a good cook, as they say, who makes the food taste 
good, for the heart and conscience can hear nothing 
more sweet. When it feels its sorrow, it is eager for it, 
and seeks the roast far away, and cannot be satisfied. 
So Mary says in the Magnificat [Luc. 1, 53.], "He has 
filled the hungry with good things." But those stubborn 
people who live in their own holiness, building on their 
works and not feeling their sin and misfortune, do not 
taste this. He that sitteth at meat, and is hungry, 
savoureth all things well: but he that is full before, 
savoureth nothing, but hath abhorrence even of the very 
best of meat. Therefore the apostle says, "Have ye 
tasted otherwise, that the Lord is good?" As if to say, If 
ye have not tasted it, | preach in vain. He goes on to say: 


V. 4 To whom you have come as to the living stone. 


11 Here he goes back to the Scriptures and touches 
the prophet Isaiah Cap. 28, 14. 15. 16. where he says: 
"Listen to what God says, you scoffers. You say, 'We 
have made a covenant with death and with hell,’ and 
have 1) made lies your consolation. For thus saith the 
LORD, | will lay in the foundations of Zion a choice and 
precious cornerstone or foundation stone" 2c. This 
saying was also used by St. Paul [Rom. 9, 33.), and is 
also a main saying of the Scriptures. For Christ is the 
precious cornerstone which God has laid, upon which 
we must be built. And see how St. Peter takes the words 
and points the stone to Christ. After that, Isaiah says "to 
put one's trust in Him", says St. Peter, is as much as to 
build on Him. This is the correct interpretation of the 
Scripture. The builders lay the foundation stone where it 
is sure and firm, so that it can carry the whole building; 
so also the living stone, Christ, carries the whole 
building. Therefore, "to build" means that we all place 
our trust and confidence in one another and place it in 
him. 


1) Weimarsche: "hat. Cf. Cap. 1, § 74. 





1011 


Who is rejected in the sight of men, but 
chosen and precious in the sight of God. 

But here he cites a saying of the prophet David in the 
118th Psalm, v. 22, 23: "The stone which the builders 
rejected has become the cornerstone, and is marvelous 
in our sight. Which saying Christ also indicates, Matth. 
21, 42. Item Peter Apost. 4, 11. where he says: "This is 
the stone which you builders rejected." Ye are builders 
(saith he), because they taught the people, and 
preached great sermons, and gave many laws, but made 
vain works saints and hypocrites. So then Christ comes 
and says thus, "You are hypocrites and vipers"; passes 
many terrible judgments on them, and keeps to the 
sinners, not to the great saints. So they cannot stand it, 
rejecting him also, saying: You are a heretic! Do you 
refuse to do good works? Well, you must die. Therefore 
Peter says here, "This is the cornerstone which is 
rejected by men, because you must be built up by faith. 
Now this is strange in our eyes (as the prophet says), it 
seems strange to us, and where the Spirit does not teach 
it, it cannot be understood in any way. Therefore he 
says, in the sight of God the stone is chosen, and a 
choice and precious stone is counted worthy to take 
away death, to pay for sin, to save from hell, and to give 
the kingdom of heaven. 


V. 5 And you also, as living stones, build 
yourselves into a spiritual house. 


How can we build ourselves? Through the gospel and 
preaching. The builders are the preachers. The 
Christians who hear the gospel are the ones who are 
being built, and the stones that must be placed on this 
cornerstone, so that we may place our trust in it, and our 
hearts may stand and rest on it. Then | must also make 
sure that | keep the form that this stone has, for if | am 
placed on it through faith, then | must also do the works 
and conduct myself as he did, and each one with me. 
Now this grows out of faith, and is the work of love, that 
we should all send one to another, and all become one 
building. So St. Paul also speaks of this, although in a 
different way. 


1012 ~— Erl. 51, 385-387. 


First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 5. W. IX, 699-702. 


1013 





another way, 1 Cor. 3, 16: "You shall be the temple of 
God." The house of stone or wood is not his house, he 
wants to have a spiritual house, that is, the Christian 
assembly, in which we are all equal in one faith, one like 
the other, and all laid on one another and joined together 
and united in love, without all malice, cunning, hypocrisy, 
hatred and back talk, as he said. 


And to the holy priesthood. 


14 Then he put down the outward and bodily 
priesthood, which was before in the Old Testament, as 
well as the outward church; he takes all this away, and 
thus wants to say: The outward being with the priesthood 
has now all ceased, therefore now another priesthood 
begins, and offers other sacrifices, namely, that it is all 
spiritual. 

(15) We have argued much that those who are now 
called priests are not priests before God, and this is 
based on this saying of Peter. Therefore take him well. 
And if someone comes here with this saying and wants 
to interpret it in this way (as some 1) have done), that he 
speaks of two kinds of priesthood, namely, of external 
and spiritual priests, then let him put on glasses so that 
he can see, and take hellebore so that he may sweep the 
brain. St. Peter thus says, "You shall build yourselves up 
to the spiritual or holy priesthood." Now ask those priests 
whether they are holy; this shows their life, as one can 
see that the wretched people are in avarice and 
fornication and all kinds of vice. He who has the 
priesthood must be holy, but he who is not holy does not 
have it. That is why St. Peter speaks only of one 
priesthood. 

16 We further ask: whether he makes a distinction 
between the spiritual and the secular, as the clergy are 
now called spiritual, the other Christians secular? So 
they must confess, without their thanks, that here St. 
Peter speaks to all who are Christians, namely to these, 
who are to put away all malice, cunning, hypocrisy and 
hatred 2c. and be like the now born little children, and 
drink the unadulterated milk. So the lie must bite itself in 
the mouth. Therefore 


1) E. g. Emser. Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. XVIII, 1353 ff. 





This is very clear: because St. Peter speaks to all 
Christians, it proves that they are lying, and St. Peter 
does not speak of their priesthood, which they have 
invented and only draw to themselves. Therefore our 
bishops are nothing but Niclas bishops;. 2) And as their 
priesthood is, so are their laws, sacrifices and works. It 
would be a fine game in the carnival without the divine 
name being blasphemed under the pretense. 

(17) Therefore only those are the holy and spiritual 
priesthood who are true Christians and built on the 
stone. For since Christ is the bridegroom, and we are the 
bride, the bride has all that the bridegroom has, including 
his own body. For when he gives himself to the bride, he 
gives himself to her even as he is; and in turn the bride 
also gives herself to him. Now Christ is the high and 
highest priest anointed by God Himself, He also 
sacrificed His own body for us, which is the highest 
priestly office; then He prayed for us on the cross; thirdly, 
He also preached the gospel, and taught all men to know 
God and Himself. These three offices he has also given 
to all of us. Therefore, because he is a priest, and we 
are his brothers, all Christians have authority and 
command, and must preach and come before God, 
pleading one for another, and offering themselves to 
God. And despite that anyone should start preaching the 
word of God or saying that he is a priest. 


To offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God 
through Jesus Christ. 


(18) Spiritual sacrifice is not money, which must be 
offered to the pope; nor is it the sacrifice as in the Old 
Testament, when one had to offer tithes of all things. 
Such physical sacrifice and priesthood has now all 
ceased, and is now all new and spiritual. The priest is 
Christ, and we all; as he has now sacrificed his body, so 
must we also sacrifice ourselves. Here now is fulfilled all 
that was signified by the outward sacrifices in the Old 
Testament, as they all came to pass, and lately all is 
called preaching the gospel. 3) Who

who practices and practices all these things, kills the 
calf, that is, the carnal mind, and strangles the old Adam. 
For the unreasonable being in the flesh and blood must 
be killed with the gospel; so we allow ourselves to be 
sacrificed and strangled on the cross. There the right 
priesthood goes in the swing, that we sacrifice to God 
the evil rogue, the lazy old donkey. If the world does not 
do it, then we must do it ourselves; for in the end 
everything must be laid aside that we have from the old 
Adam, as we have just heard in Chapter 1 [§ 83 ff]. This 
is the only sacrifice that is pleasing and acceptable to 
God. From this you can now see where our fools and 
blind leaders have led us, and how this text has 
remained under the bank. 

019 Now thou mayest say, If it be true that we are all 
priests, and shall preach, what manner of being shall it 
be? Shall there be no difference among the people, and 
shall the women also be priests? Answer: In the New 
Testament there should be no priests bearing plates, not 
because it is evil of him, but because there should be no 
difference between them and the common Christian 
man, which faith cannot suffer; so that those who are 
now called priests should all be laymen like the others, 
and only some ministers should be chosen by the 
congregation to preach. So there is only a difference 
outwardly of the office to which one is called by the 
congregation. But in the sight of God there is no 
difference, and only for this reason are some of them 
drawn from among the congregation, so that they may 
lead and carry out the ministry in place of the 
congregation, which they all have, not so that one has 
more authority than the other. Therefore, none of them 
should appear and preach in the congregation, but one 
must be drawn out of the crowd and put in place, and he 
may be removed again if he wishes. 

(20) Now they have established a status of their own, 
as if it were from God, and have gained such freedom 
that there is almost no greater distinction in the midst of 
Christendom, neither among us nor among the Turks. If 
you want to look at the Christians, you must not look at 
any difference, and not say: This is a man or a woman, 
a servant or a master, old or young, like Paul. 


1015 


Gal. 3, 28. It is all one thing and one spiritual people. 
Therefore they are all priests, may all preach God's 
word; but women are not to speak in the church, but let 
the men preach, for the sake of the commandment that 
they should be subject to their husbands, as St. Paul 
teaches 1 Cor. 14, 34. God allows such an order to 
remain, but does not make a difference of authority. But 
where there were no men, but vain women, as in 
nunneries, one would also raise up a woman among 
them to preach. 

(21) Now this is the true priesthood, which is in the 
three parts, as we have heard (17), that one sacrifices 
spiritually, prays for the church, and preaches. Whoever 
can do this is a priest; they are all guilty of preaching the 
word, praying for the church, and offering themselves 
before God. Let those fools therefore depart, who call 
the spiritual estate priests, who yet have no other office, 
but that they bear plates and are smeared. If the bribing 
and greasing made a priest, | might as well grease and 
anoint the paws of a donkey, that he also might be a 
priest. 

Lastly, St. Peter says that we should offer spiritual 
sacrifices that are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ. 
Since Christ is the cornerstone on which we are set, 
what we want to do for God must be done through Him 
alone, as we have heard enough above [§55]. For God 
would not look at my cross if | were to torture myself to 
death; but He looks at Christ, through whom my works 
are valid before God, which otherwise would not be 
worth a straw. That is why the Scriptures call Christ a 
precious cornerstone, who imparts fine virtue to all who 
are built on him through faith. Thus St. Peter teaches us 
in the saying, how Christ is the living stone, what Christ 
is. And this is a fine likeness, from which it is easy to 
understand how one should believe in Christ. So now 
follows: 


V. 6-10. Therefore it is written, Behold, I lay in 
Zion a chosen and precious cornerstone, and 
whosoever believeth in him shall not be put to shame. 
Now to you who believe, it is precious; but to the 
unbeliever, it is not. 


1016 Eni. si, Z89-S91. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 6-10. 


w. ix, 704-707. 1017 





The stone that the builders rejected has become the 
cornerstone, the stone of offense, and the rock of 
offense for those who stumble at the word and do not 
believe in it, in which they are placed. But you are the 
chosen generation, the royal priesthood, the holy 
people, the people of ownership, that you should 
proclaim the virtue of him who called you from 
darkness to his marvelous light. You were not a 
people, but now you are God's people, and God has 
not had mercy on you, but now he has had mercy on 
you. 


23 | have said before [Cap. 1, §§ 34. 76. 94. Cap. 2, 
§ 11], that St. Peter lards his epistle well and keeps it with 
scriptures, as all preachers should do, so that their 
foundation stands entirely on God's word. Thus, he lists 
four or five sayings in succession. The first one he took 
from the prophet Isaiah, Cap. 28, 16, from word to word, 
that Christ is a precious cornerstone or foundation stone; 
and this is the very saying that we have now discussed 
and explained [§ 11]. It is a right main saying of the 
doctrine of faith, which should be taken as a basis if 
someone wants to preach in a place where Christ was 
not preached before. For it must be begun from him that 
Christ is the stone on which faith is to be built and stand. 

(24) But that the prophet does not speak of a physical 
stone in that place is proved by the fact that it follows: 
"He that believeth on him shall not be put to shame." If | 
am to believe in him, it must be a spiritual stone; for how 
else can | believe in stone and wood? For this he must 
truly be God; for God has forbidden in the first 
commandment [Ex. 20:3, 4] that one should believe in no 
thing but him alone. Because the stone is laid for the 
foundation, where one is to trust in, it must be God 
Himself. Again, he cannot be God alone, but must also 
be man at the same time, therefore he must be part of 
the building; and not only part, but also the head. Now 
when one builds a structure, one stone must be like 
another, so that each has the other's kind, nature and 
form. Therefore, because we are built on Christ, he must 
be like us, and he must be like us. 


The same nature as the other stones that lie on him, that 
is, a true man like all of us. So the Scripture expresses 
with simple and small words such a great thing, namely 
the whole sum of our faith, and understands in such 
short sayings more than no man can express. 

(25) | have also said [§ 13] what the building is, 
namely, faith, by which we are placed in Christ, and put 
our trust in the stone, and so become like it; and that this 
must happen in such a way that the building fits 
together. For the other stones must all be laid and 
aligned after the stone. This then is love, the fruit of faith. 

026 But why doth the prophet call him a foundation 
stone? Because no building can be made without first 
laying a stone as a foundation. For the other stones of 
the building cannot stand without the foundation stone. 
So we must all stand on Christ and recognize him as a 
foundation stone. Therefore we may not boast that the 
stone must take something from us, but we must receive 
benefit from it alone. For we do not bear it, but it bears 
us, and on it rests sin, death, hell, and all that we have; 
so that all this and what offends us cannot harm us if we 
are set on the foundation. For if therefore we abide on 
him, and rely on him, we must also abide where he is. 
Just as natural stones must rely on their foundation 
stone. 

The prophet also calls him "a cornerstone”. The Holy 
Spirit has his way of speaking much in short words. 
Christ is a cornerstone because he brought together the 
Gentiles and the Jews, who had been mortal enemies 
among themselves, and thus the Christian Church was 
gathered from both people, of which Paul the Apostle 
writes much. The Jews boasted of the law of God and 
that they were God's people, and despised the Gentiles. 
But now Christ has come and has taken away the glory 
of the Jews, and has also claimed us Gentiles, and so 
he has made us both one through your faith, and has 
dealt with us in such a way that we both must confess 
that we have nothing of ourselves. 


1018 en. si, 391-384. Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. ix, 707-710. 


1019 





but are all sinners, and must alone await godliness and 
heaven from him, and that we Gentiles as well believe 
that Christ has come to help us as the Jews. Therefore 
he is the cornerstone that joins two walls together, Jew 
and Gentile, so that they become one building and one 
house. 

28 Now the prophet concludes, "He that believeth on 
him shall not be put to shame. Since the Holy Spirit says 
that those who believe in Christ will not be put to shame, 
he gives us to understand what he has in mind, namely, 
that he has already let the judgment go and decided that 
all the world must be put to shame and disgraced. But 
he wants to draw some out of the crowd, so that no one 
may escape disgrace, except the one who believes in 
Christ. Thus Christ himself lays it down in the last verse 
of Marci, v. 16: "He that believeth and is baptized shall 
be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. 
With which words he also touches the prophet here. 
That is why Peter said in the first chapter, v. 10, that the 
prophets searched the time and searched for salvation, 
and prophesied of the future grace beforehand. So then 
Christ is to be preached, that he is the one who has 
delivered us from this disgrace in which we have all 
been. 

29 Therefore, let him who will, stand up and praise 
free will, and defend the powers of man. If you want to 
overthrow all men's works and doctrine, and what comes 
from men, you have enough in this saying alone, which 
pushes it all down, so that it must fall like the dry leaves 
from the tree. For it is decided that what is not on the 
stone is already lost. He will not suffer you to do anything 
by works. The spirit and the divine majesty speak with 
such simplicity that no one pays attention, but with such 
force that all things are overthrown. Who then wants to 
act against it, or who does not want to be frightened by 
it? Therefore God would have us despair of ourselves 
altogether, and measure ourselves only by the goods 
that He has, and let us build on the foundation that no 
creature can overthrow, so that no one may rely on his 
own piety, but on Christ's righteousness, and on all that 
Christ has done. 





has. But what does it mean to rely on His righteousness? 
Nothing else, but to despair of myself, and to think that 
my righteousness, my truth, must all fail, and to trust that 
His righteousness, His truth, His life, and all the goods 
that He has, will endure forever. There is the ground, 
where | stand up. What does not stand on this 
foundation, all will have to fall. But he that trusteth in this 
alone shall not be put to shame, and shall abide, that no 
violence shall not hurt him. Therefore, Christ shall not be 
a stone alone, but God will also lay him as a foundation; 
we should take comfort in this. God has said that he will 
not be able to lie. 

(30) Now this stone does not serve itself, but is kicked 
and buried in the ground, so that it is not seen; and the 
other stones lie on it, and are seen. Therefore it is given 
to us, that we should take from it and rely on it and 
believe what it has, that it is all ours, what it is able to do, 
that it has been given to us, that | may say: This is my 
own good and treasure, of which my conscience can be 
comforted. Now St. Peter speaks further: 


V.7, 8: Now to you who believe, it is precious. But 
to the unbelievers the stone which the builders 
rejected has become the cornerstone, and the stone of 
offence and the rock of vexation. 

(31) The good and precious stone, Peter says, is 
precious and honest to some, but to many it is not 
precious, but is a stumbling block. How does this 
happen? The Scripture speaks of it in two ways, that 
there are some who believe and many who do not. To 
those who believe, he is precious; my heart must rejoice 
when | put my confidence and comfort in him. Therefore 
he says, "He is precious to you who believe"; that is, you 
think much of him. For though he himself is good and 
precious, yet it is of no use to me, nor does it help me; 
therefore he must be precious to us, so that he may give 
us many precious things, like a precious stone, which 1) 


1) "The" does not refer to "precious stone," which is of the neuter 
gender, but to Christ. 


1020 Erl. 51, 394-396. First edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 7. 8. W. IX, 710-712. 


does not keep his virtue with him, but breaks out, and 
gives all his strength from himself, so that | have all that 
he is. 

The unbelievers, however, do not consider it to be 
such a precious stone, but reject it, and are offended by 
it; therefore it is not comforting to them, but harmful and 
annoying, even though it is otherwise comforting in itself. 
These are not only the gross, public sinners, but much 
more the great saints, who rely on their free will, on their 
works and piety; they have to push themselves against 
this stone and run up against it. God now makes a 
judgment that those who enter without works come to 
righteousness through faith alone; but those do not come 
to it, because they want to come to it through their own 
piety, as St. Paul says Rom. 10, 3. 

33 Therefore this became the stone, says St. Peter, 
which the builders rejected. And there he joins the 
Scriptures together, but uses the saying which he 
touched upon above [§ 12], from the 118th Psalm, v. 22: 
"The stone which the builders rejected has become the 
cornerstone." Who the builders are, | have explained 
enough 13), namely, those who teach, preach the law, 
and want to make pious people by works; they agree 
with Christ as winter and summer. Therefore, the 
preachers who preach works must reject this stone. 

-About this he takes another saying from the prophet 
Isaiah, Cap. 8, 13. 14. There the prophet wrote that it 
would be as St. Peter says here, and thus says: "The 
Lord shall be your fear, he shall become your sanctuary; 
but he shall become a stone of stumbling and a rock of 
offence to the two houses of Israel. Thus the prophet 
means that the Lord shall become a sanctuary for you, 
that is, he shall be sanctified in your hearts; you shall 
have no other sanctification, either this or that, except 
that you believe. For others he will be a stone, and they 
will stumble and be offended. 

(35) What then is the offense and tarnishing? It is 
when one preaches Christ and says, "Behold, this is why 
this stone was laid on the foundation, so that you might 
be reminded of it. 


1021 


You despair and despair of yourself, thinking that your 
works and your own piety are vain, and that you rely on 
him alone, believing that Christ's righteousness is your 
righteousness. When they hear this, they recoil and 
recoil, and are angry, and say: How can you say that 
virginity and mass and such good works are nothing? 
That is the devil's way of speaking. For they cannot 
judge that their conduct is not good; they think that it is 
well done in the sight of God, and they also bring up 
sayings from the Scriptures, saying, "God has 
commanded that one should do good works. When they 
want to put this down, they raise their voices and shout: 
"Heretic, heretic! Fire, fire! Therefore they cannot bear 
the stone and want to overturn it; so they clash against 
each other, so that they must be crushed on this stone, 
as Christ says Matth. 21:42: "Have you not read in the 
Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has 
become the cornerstone?" (and follows v. 44.:) "And 
whosoever shall fall upon this stone shall be broken: but 
of whomsoever it shall fall, it shall break him in pieces." 
Therefore do as you will, there is no shame in the stone; 
it is laid, and will remain. Now whoever wants to run up 
against it and rub against it will have to break. 

(36) Now this is the offence and the vexation of which 
the Scriptures speak much. So the Jews are still striking 
at the stone today, and there is no end to it until the last 
day comes: then this stone will fall on all unbelievers and 
crush them. Therefore, though Christ is such a chosen 
and precious stone, yet he must be called a stone of 
offense and stumbling, through no fault of his own. And 
as the Jews did, so do we now forever. For as they 
boasted in God's name that they were God's people, so 
it is also now, that under Christ's name and the name of 
the Christian church, people deny Christ and reject the 
precious stone. He comes therefore that they should 
reject their work, but this they cannot suffer and reject 
Him. Therefore it follows: 


Those who take offense at the word, and do not 
believe in it, on which they are set. 


1022 en. 51, 396-398. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


(37) When it is said that their works are not good and 
do not count in the sight of God, they cannot and will not 
hear it. Now God has set Christ as the foundation on 
which they should be placed, and through Him they 
should have attained all salvation, and has had Him 
preached to the whole world, that they might be founded 
on Him through the preaching of the Gospel. So they will 
not accept him, but reject him, and continue in their own 
mind and works. For if they were thus established on 
him, their honor, wealth, and power would fall, and they 
would no longer be exalted. Further, St. Peter speaks: 


V. 9. But you are the chosen generation, the royal 
priesthood, the holy nation, the people of ownership. 


38. he gives the Christians a righteous title, and has 
taken the saying from Moses, Deut. 7, 6. where he says 
to the Jews: "You are a holy people to God your Lord, 
and God your Lord has chosen you as a people of 
ownership from all the nations that are on earth. Item, 2 
Mos. 19, 5. 6. he says: "You shall be my property before 
all nations, and you shall be a priestly kingdom and a 
holy nation to me." There you see what Peter is talking 
about. As | said before [15 ff], so | still say that one should 
be accustomed to speak of priests as the Scriptures do. 
Let no one be troubled whom men call priests; let them 
call each one what they will, and keep the word of God: 
whatsoever the same is called priest, that call thou also 
priest. We will let it happen that those priests whom the 
bishops and the pope consecrate call themselves, and 
call themselves what they will, so far from calling 
themselves "God's priests"; for they cannot find a word 
of it for themselves from the Scriptures. 

39 But when they come with this saying, that he 
speaks of them, answer thus, as | have taught above 
[§15], and ask them to whom St. Peter speaks here? 
then they will have to stand with shame. For it is clear 
and public enough that he speaks to the whole multitude, 
to all Christians, in that he says: You are the chosen race 
and holy people; so he has never spoken of them before. 


1023 


W. IX, 712-715. 


No priest has ever spoken of anyone except those who 
are laid on the stone and believe. Therefore it must follow 
that whoever does not believe is not a priest. 

40 So they say: Ei, one must interpret the words thus, 
as the holy fathers have interpreted it. Then say, Let the 
fathers and teachers, whoever they are, interpret as they 
will. So St. Peter tells me that he has greater testimony 
from God than those; he is also older, therefore | will 
keep it with him. So, too, the saying may not be a gloss. 
For he says in express words about those who believe. 
Now they alone are not believers who are smeared and 
wear plates. Therefore we will gladly grant them that they 
may call themselves so, for we do not inquire how they 
will be reproached; but the dispute is whether they are 
called priests in the Scriptures, and whether God calls 
them so. Some may be drawn out of the congregation 
who are ministers and servants, and appointed to preach 
in the congregation and to administer the sacraments; 
but we are all priests before God, if we are Christians. 
For since we are laid upon the stone, which is the chief 
priest before God, we also have all that He has. 

(41) Therefore | would very much that this word 
"priest" were as common as that we should be called 
Christians; for it is all one thing, priests, baptized, 
Christians. Just as | should not suffer that the smeared 
and scorched should call themselves Christians and 
baptized alone, so | should not suffer that they should 
want to be priests alone. Nevertheless they have drawn 
it upon themselves alone. So they have also called the 
church, which the pope decides with his pointed hats. 
But the Scripture reverses it. Therefore notice this well, 
so that you may know how to make a distinction between 
what God calls priests and what they call themselves 
priests. For so we must raise again that this little word 
"priest" becomes as common as the little word 
"Christians. For being a priest does not belong to an 
office that is external; it is only such an office that acts 
before God. 

So it is also true that we are all kings. "Priest" and 
"king" are everything 


1) with its pointed hats - with its bishops. 


1024 


Erl. 51, 398-400. 


First editing. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 9. w. Ix, 715-717. 


1025 





spiritual names, such as Christians, saints, church. And 
just as you are not called a Christian because you have 
much money and goods, but because you are built on 
the stone and believe in Christ, so you are not called a 
priest because you wear a plate or a long skirt, but 
because you may stand before God. Likewise, you are 
not a king because you wear a golden crown and have 
much land and people under you, but because you are 
a lord over all things, death, sin and hell. For you are as 
much a king as Christ is a king, if you believe in him. 
Now he is not a king, as worldly kings are, nor does he 
wear a crown of gold, nor does he ride forth with great 
pomp and many horses, but he is a king over all kings, 
having authority over all things, and all things must be at 
his feet. As he is a lord, so am | a lord: for what he hath, 
that have | also. 

(43) Now someone might say: St. Peter also says 
here that Christians are also kings: so it is clear that we 
are not all kings; therefore let this saying not be 
understood as speaking of all in general. For he that is 
a Christian is not king of France, nor priest of Rome. So 
| also ask: is the king of France also a king before God? 
He does not; for God will not judge by the crown. On 
earth he is king and before the world, but when death 
comes, his kingdom is over, for then he will have to lie 
at the feet of those who believe. We are talking about an 
eternal kingdom and priesthood; every one who believes 
is truly a king before God. But who does not know that 
we are not all circumcised and smeared priests? But 
because they are smeared, they are not priests before 
God; neither are they kings before God because they 
are crowned. Crowned kings and smeared priests 
belong to the world and are made by men. The pope 
may make as many such priests as he wishes, so far 
from making priests before God, for God Himself will 
make them. 

44 Therefore, when St. Peter says here, "You are the 
royal priesthood," it is just that. 


as much as if he said: You are Christians. Now if you 
want to know what the Christians' title and power and 
prize is, you will see here that they are kings and priests, 
and the chosen people. But what is the priesthood? 
Follow hereafter: 


That you may proclaim the virtue of Him who 
called you from darkness to His marvelous light. 


This belongs to a priest, that he is God's messenger 
and has orders from God to proclaim His word. The 
virtue (says St. Peter), that is, the miraculous work that 
God has done for you, so that He might bring you from 
darkness into light, is what you are to preach, which is 
the highest priestly office. And so shall your preaching 
be done, that one brother may proclaim to another the 
powerful deed of God, how you have been redeemed 
from sin, hell and death and all misfortune through Him, 
and have been called to eternal life. In the same way you 
should teach other people, how they also come to such 
light. For all things are to be directed to this end, that you 
may know what God has done for you, and that you may 
make it your noblest work to proclaim this publicly, and 
to call everyone to the light to which you have been 
called. Where you see people who do not know this, you 
should instruct them and also teach them as you have 
learned, namely, how one must be saved through the 
virtue and power of God and come from darkness to 
light. 

(46) And here you see that St. Peter clearly says that 
there is only one light, and concludes that all our reason, 
however wise it is, is darkness. For although reason can 
count, one, two, three, and also see what is black or 
white, large or small, and judge other external things, it 
cannot see what faith is. There it is staarblind. And if all 
men's wisdom were combined, they could not 
understand one letter of the divine wisdom. Therefore 
St. Peter speaks here of another light, which is 
marvelous, and says freshly to all of us that we are all in 
the fin-de-siécle. 


1) In the second adaptation (as it seems to us, better): "though all 
men have their prudence" 2c. 


1026 en. 51, 400-402. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. w. ix, 717-720. 


1027 





We are blind and starry-eyed where God does not call 
us to His true light. 

Experience also teaches us this. For when it is 
preached that we cannot come before God by works, but 
must have a mediator who may come before God and 
reconcile us to him, reason must confess that it cannot 
know this at all. Therefore, it must have a different light 
and knowledge if it is to understand this. Therefore, 
everything that is not God's word and faith is darkness. 
For reason gropes like a blind man, always falling from 
one to the other, and does not know what it is doing. But 
if one says such things to the learned and wise men of 
the world, they do not want to hear it and start to scream 
and rave against it. Therefore St. Peter is truly a bold 
apostle, that he may call darkness, which all the world 
calls light. 

(48) So we see that the first and most noble office we 
Christians should do is to proclaim the virtue of God. 
What then are the virtues and noble deeds that God has 
shown? They are, as we have often said [Cap. 1, §§ 18. 
58], that Christ by the power of God has swallowed up 
death, devoured hell, and drunk up sin, and set us on the 
path to eternal life; these are such great virtues that no 
man is able to comprehend them, much less to do them. 
Therefore it is nothing at all that we Christians preach 
the doctrine of man, but of such power should we be 
preached that overcomes the devil, sin and death. 

(49) And here St. Peter has once again stirred up 
many sayings, as he almost always leads one saying 
into another through and through. 1) For all the prophets 
say that God's name and glory and his arm or power 
should be honored and praised, and that he should do 
such a work that the whole world should sing and say 
about it. The prophets are full of this in all places, and St. 
Peter points to all of them here. They also spoke a lot 
about light and darkness, that we must be enlightened 
with God's light; so that they also indicate that all human 
reason is darkness. St. Peter continues: 


1) Cf. § 23. 


V. 10. You who were not a people in the past, but 
are now God's people, and on whom God had no 
mercy, but now has mercy. 


50 This saying is expressed in the prophet Hosea 
Cap. 2, 23, and St. Paul also referred to it in Rom. 9, 25: 
"| will make this to be called my people, which is not my 
people. All this is based on the fact that God Almighty 
specially chose the people of Israel and gave them great 
honor, gave them many prophets, and also did many 
miracles with them, so that He would make Christ a man 
out of the people; all this happened for the sake of the 
child; that is why they are called God's people in the 
Scriptures. But this the prophets have further cut out and 
said, that this promise should break out, and also affect 
the Gentiles. That is why St. Peter says here, "You are 
God's people, who were not God's people in the past." 
From this it is clear that he wrote the epistle to the 
Gentiles, not to the Jews. With this he now wants to 
indicate that the saying of the prophet has been fulfilled, 
that they are now a holy people, having ownership, 
priesthood and kingdom, and all that Christ has, if they 
believe. This is what follows in Petro: 


I exhort you, brethren, as strangers and pilgrims, 
3) abstain from the fleshly lusts which war against the 
soul, and lead a good walk among the Gentiles, that 
they who speak evil of you as of evildoers may see 
your good works and praise God when the day comes. 


Here St. Peter speaks a little differently than St. Paul, 
who would not speak as we will hear, because every 
apostle has his own way of speaking, as well as every 
prophet. So far, he has laid the foundation of the 
Christian faith, as the main part begins. Now he goes on 
and teaches how we are to conduct ourselves toward all 
men. 

(52) This is a right way of preaching, that first of all 
one should strike out faith from what it is. 


2) In the second edit: "him". 
3) Weimarsche: "pylgerhn". This word comes from the Latin 
per[Arirnis. (Dietz.) 


1028 


and what his power and nature are, namely, that he 
gives us all that we need for piety and salvation, so that 
nothing can be done but by faith, and through it we have 
all that God has. Now that God has come with us and 
given us all that is His and has become our own, so that 
we have all goods and sufficiency through faith, what 
shall we do? Shall we walk idly? It would be best for us 
to die, then we would have it all. But because we live 
here, we should also do the same to our neighbor and 
give ourselves to him as God has given Himself to us. 
Thus faith makes us blessed; but love is that we give 
ourselves to our neighbor when we have enough. That 
is, faith takes from God; love gives to the neighbor. That 
is what is said in short words. One can also preach a lot 
about it, and further emphasize it, as St. Peter does here. 

53 This is the apostle's opinion when he says: "Dear 
brethren, | admonish you as strangers and pilgrims. 
Forasmuch then as ye are one with Christ, and even one 
Church, and his goods are yours, and your loss is his 
loss, and he taketh unto himself all that ye have, ye 
ought therefore to follow him, and so to hold yourselves, 
as though ye were no more citizens of the world: for your 
goods are not on earth, but in heaven: and though ye 
have lost all temporal goods, yet have ye Christ, who is 
more than all these things. The devil is a prince of the 
world and rules it; his citizens are the people of the world. 
Therefore, since you are not of the world, do as a 
stranger in an inn who has no fine goods, but only takes 
food and gives his money for it. For it is only a passage 
here, where we cannot stay, but must travel on. 
Therefore we have no more need of worldly goods, but 
that we may fill ourselves, and so depart, and go to 
another country. We are citizens in heaven; on earth we 
are pilgrims and guests. 


Abstain from fleshly lusts, which fight against the 
soul.

about external fornication or St. Paul.

who calls everything carnal that a man does without 
faith, who is in the body and carnal life. But | think that 
St. Peter has a little different consecration, nor do | think 
that he takes the word "soul", like Paul, for the spirit; but 
St. Peter (as | think) has given himself further into the 
common Greek language than St. Paul. But there is no 
power in it, it is understood of all kinds of lusts, or only 
of carnal lust or fornication. But this is what he wants to 
indicate here, that no saint on earth can be completely 
perfect and pure. 

The high schools have also trampled underfoot this 
saying, and do not understand it either; they think that it 
is only said of sinners, as if the saints had no more evil 
desire. But whoever wants to study the Scriptures 
properly must understand a difference, because the 
prophets sometimes speak of saints as if they were pure 
in all things. Again, they also speak of them in this way, 
that they still have evil desires, and bite themselves with 
sins. In these two things they cannot be judged. 
Therefore let it be understood that Christians are divided 
into two parts: the inward being, which is faith, and the 
outward being, which is the flesh. Now if a Christian is 
regarded according to faith, he is pure and entirely 
clean, for the word of God has nothing impure in him, 
and where it enters into the heart, it must also make it 
entirely clean; therefore in faith all things are perfect. 
Accordingly, we are kings and priests and God's people, 
as stated above [§38 ff]. But because faith is in the flesh, 
and we still live on earth, we feel evil inclinations at 
times, as impatience and fear of death 2c. These are all 
still infirmities of the old man; for faith is not yet fully 
ingrown, does not have perfect power over the flesh. 

(56) You can understand this from a parable in the 
Gospel, Luc. 10:30 ff, about the man who went down 
from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among the 
murderers, who beat him and left him half dead. Then 
you see that this man, because he is now

The only thing missing, however, is that he is not 
completely healed. Life is there, but his health is not yet 
complete; he is still under the care of physicians and 
must still be healed. So we also have the Lord Christ 
complete, and are assured of eternal life, but we do not 
have complete health; something of the old Adam still 
remains in the flesh. So also is the likeness of Matthew 
13:33, where Christ says, "The kingdom of heaven is like 
unto leaven, which a woman taketh, and maketh to be 
mixed with flour, until it be thoroughly leavened." When 
you make a dough of flour, the leaven is all in it, but it 
has not gone all the way through, and has not worked its 
way through; but the flour lies in the work until it becomes 
thoroughly leavened, and now no more leaven shall be 
added to it. So you also have what you are supposed to 
have by faith, so that you may grasp the word of God; 
but it has not gone through at all, so it must work until 
you are completely leavened. In this way you shall 
discern the Scriptures, so that you do not also torture 
them as the papists do. 

(57) Therefore | say, when it is read of the saints in 
the Scriptures that they have been perfect, understand it 
to mean that they have been completely pure and 
without sin according to faith; but yet the flesh has still 
been there, which could not have been completely pure. 
Therefore Christians desire and ask that the body or the 
flesh be put to death, so that they may become 
completely pure. Those who teach otherwise have 
neither felt nor tasted this. This makes them speak as 
they think and understand with their reason; therefore 
they must also fail. The great saints, who wrote and 
taught a great deal, may have stumbled here. Origen has 
not a word of it in his books. Jerome never understood it. 
If Augustine had not had to quarrel with the Pelagians, 
he would not have understood it very well. When they 
speak of saints, they exalt them as if they were 
something different and better than other Christians; just 
as if they had not felt the flesh and complained about it, 
just as we do. That is why St. Peter says here: "You are 
pure and have righteousness in its entirety; 


So fight henceforth with the evil airs. So also Christ says 
in the Gospel of John, Cap. 13, 10: "He that is washed 
must wash the feet also"; it is not enough that the head 
and hands are clean. Therefore, even though he says 
that they are completely clean, he still wants them to 
wash their feet. 

(58) But what does St. Peter mean by saying, 
"Abstain from the lusts that war against the soul"? This 
is what he means: You must not think that it will be all 
right to play and sleep. Sin is now gone through faith, but 
you still have the flesh, which is still senseless and 
raging; therefore see to it that you suppress it. You will 
have to force the air and subdue it, and the greater your 
faith, the greater will be the attacks; therefore you must 
be armed and hardened, and thus fight without ceasing. 
For they will attack you with multitudes and want to take 
you captive. Therefore St. Paul also says Rom. 7:22, 23: 
"| delight in the law of God according to the inward man: 
but | find another law in my members, which warreth 
against the law in my mind, and taketh me captive, that | 
should do those things which | would not." As if to say, "I 
fight against it, but it will not cease. Therefore | would like 
to be rid of it, but it will not be. My will is of no use. What 
then shall | do? "| wretched man (saith he, v. 24), who 
shall deliver me from the body of this death?" So now all 
the saints cry out. 

59. But the people who are without faith, the devil 
leads them so that he only lets them go and follow them 
in sins, and does not beat them at all. But the others, he 
thinks, | have already caught with unbelief; so | will let 
them go, so that they will not do gross sin, and will not 
have great temptation, and so will cover their grief and 
their mischief. The faithful, however, have enough 
temptation and must always be in battle. Those who are 
without faith and spirit do not feel it, or go after it, break 
out and follow evil desires; but as soon as the spirit and 
faith come into the heart, man becomes so weak that he 
thinks he cannot think the least thought and fear. 


1032 Eri. si, 407-4W. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 11. 12. W. ix, 726-728. 


And he seeth that all sin is in him from the top of his head 
even to the bottom of his feet. For before he believed, 
he went as he pleased; but now that the Spirit is come, 
and will make him clean, the controversy ariseth, and 
the devil, and the flesh, and the world, lay themselves 
up against faith. All the prophets complain about this in 
the Scriptures. 

(60) Therefore St. Peter says that the conflict is not 
in sinners, but in believers; and he also gives a 
consolation that one may resist evil desires, so that one 
may only bark against them. If you already have evil 
thoughts, do not despair; only see that you do not let 
them take you captive. Our teachers have tried to advise 
people to torture themselves until they no longer have 
evil thoughts, so that they have finally become mad and 
insane. But learn thou thus, if thou be a Christian, that 
thou shalt doubtless feel all manner of impulses and evil 
inclinations in the flesh. For when faith is there, a 
hundred evil thoughts, a hundred temptations, come 
more than before. Only see to it that you are a man and 
do not let yourself be caught, and always rebel and say: 
| do not want to, | do not want to. For this must be the 
way of wicked men and women, who are always 
grumbling against each other, and what one wants, the 
other does not want. 

61 This is called a righteous Christian life, which is 
never at rest, and is not done in such a way that one 
should not feel sin, but that one should feel it, but only 
not be willing to commit it. Then one should fast, pray, 
work, that one may curb and suppress lust. Therefore 
you must not think that you want to become a saint, as 
those fools talk about it. Because blood and flesh 
remain, sin also remains; therefore it must always be 
disputed. Whoever then does not experience this must 
not boast that he is a Christian. 

(62) So far we have been taught that if we had 
confessed or entered a spiritual state, we would now be 
pure and would no longer be allowed to fight with our 
sins. They also said that baptism made us pure and 
clean, so that no evil remained in man. 





1033 


thought: Now | want to have a good rest. Then the devil 
came and overthrew them worse than before. Therefore, 
come to your senses. If you want to confess and be 
absolved, then you must act like a soldier who enters the 
fray at the head, since it is now only valid, and the war 
begins, that you will now be hit right, just as if it was 
before the insult; then you must first pull out the knife and 
lash out. But now, because the dispute lasts, so long 
must there always be a stir. So also, if you have been 
baptized, see that you are not safe from the devil and 
from sin for an hour, and that you think you will have no 
peace. 

Therefore Christian life is nothing but a battle and a 
camp, as the Scripture says [Job 7:1], and therefore also 


our Lord God is called [Ps. 24:10] Dominus Sabaoth, 
which is a Lord over the hosts; item, v. 10: Dominus 


potens in praelio. And with this he shows how powerful 
he is, that he always lets his people stand in war and take 
the lead, since the trumpets always sound, that he always 
remembers: fight here, fight there; thrust here, strike 
there; that it is therefore an eternal battle, since you must 
do everything you can, so that you may strike down the 
devil with the word of God. You must always resist and 
call upon God, and despair of all human strength. Now 
follows further: 


V. 12. And conduct yourselves in a good way, that 
those who speak evil of you, as of evildoers, may see 
your good works and praise God. 


See how St. Peter keeps such a fine order 2). Now he 
has taught what we should do, that we should subdue our 
flesh with all its lusts; now he also teaches why the same 
should be done. Why should | subdue my flesh? That | 
may be saved? No; but that | may walk in righteousness 
before the world. For a good walk does not make us 
righteous, but we must be righteous and believe before 
we begin to walk in righteousness. But the

| am not to make use of this outward conduct, but so that 
the heathen may be improved and provoked by it, so that 
they may also come to Christ through us (which is a true 
work of love). They speak evil of us and reproach us, 
considering us to be the worst of boys; therefore we 
should show ourselves with such a fine conduct that they 
must say: "Well, you can't blame them. 

We read that when the emperors ruled and 
persecuted the Christians, they could not be blamed, 
except that they worshipped Christ and considered him 
a god, as Pliny wrote to the emperor Trajan, 1) that he 
knew of no evil that the Christians did, except that they 
came together early every morning and sang several 
hymns, so that they honored their Christ and took the 
sacrament; otherwise no one could blame them. 
Therefore St. Peter says, "You must suffer yourselves to 
be reproached as evildoers; therefore you must conduct 
yourselves in such a way that you do no harm to anyone, 
and so you will make them better. "When it shall come 
to pass," that is, you must suffer yourselves to be 
reproached until [it] shall break out and be made 
manifest, that it may be seen how they have wronged 
you, and that they must praise God in you. Thus now St. 
Peter speaks further: 


V. 13-17. Be subject to all human order for the 
sake of the Lord, whether to the king as the ruler, or 
to the guardians as the messengers from him, for the 
vengeance of evildoers, and for the praise of 
benefactors. For this is the will of God, that you plug 
with benevolence the ignorance of foolish men, as the 
free, and not as if you had the liberty to cover 
wickedness, but as the servants of God. Be respectful 
to everyone; love the brotherhood; fear God; honor 
the king. 

So St. Peter goes along ina fine and orderly way and 
teaches us how we should conduct ourselves in all 
things. So far, he has spoken in general about how one 
should conduct oneself in all states. Now he begins to 
teach how one should behave against the 


1) ?1in. Lpx. X, 96. (126rt. [. xol. 2. dus. id. 6. 
111, 33.) (Weim. ed.) 





worldly authorities. For since he has now said enough, 
first of all, what one should do against God and for 
oneself, he now also says how one should behave 
toward all people; and thus he wants to say: First of all, 
and above all things, when you have now done 
everything, that you therefore walk in a righteous faith, 
and keep your body in discipline, so that it does not 
follow the evil airs, let this be the first work, that you are 
obedient to the authorities. 

67. that | have here translated "of all human order", 


is called in Greek language and in Latin creatura. Our 
scholars have not understood that either. The German 
language expresses it finely, what the little word means, 
when one says: What the prince creates, that shall be 
kept. So he needs the little word here; as if he should 
say: What the authorities create, therein be obedient. 
For "to create" means to command, and "order" is a 


creature of men. Those have drawn it that creatura 
means an ox and an ass; as the pope also speaks of it. 
If Peter meant this, then one would also have to be 
subject to a servant. But it is called "human order" laws 
or command, and what they create, 2) that one should 
do. What God creates, gives and wants, that is fine 
order, namely that one believes. Now there is also a 
human and worldly creation, namely, that which is 
written with commandments, how the _ outward 
government should be; to this we are also to be subject. 


Therefore understand the little word that creatura 
humana means: quod creat et condit homo. 


For the sake of the Lord. 


(68) We are not obliged to be obedient to the 
authorities for their sake (he says), but for the sake of 
God, whose children we are. This is to provoke us, not 
that we have any merit in it; for what | do for God's sake, 
| must do freely to serve Him, so that | will gladly do 
anything for free that His heart desires. But why should 
one be obedient to the authorities for the sake of God? 


2) "creates" is found in the second edit. Subject is: human order. 
Bucer: quns MuZistratns eonait stntnit. Weimarsche: "schaffen". For

W. IX, 731-733. 1037 





Therefore, it is God's will that evildoers be punished and 
benefactors protected, so that unity may remain in the 
world. So we should promote outward peace, that is 
what God wants. For since we do not all believe, but 
most of the people are unbelievers, he created and 
decreed that the world should not devour one another, 
that the authorities should wield the sword and defend 
the wicked, if they do not want peace, that they must do 
so. This is what he decrees through the authorities, so 
that the world may be governed well in all places. 

(69) So you see, if there were not wicked people, no 
authority would be allowed; therefore he says, "For 
vengeance and punishment to evildoers, and for praise 
to benefactors. The pious shall have a price, if they do 
right, that the worldly authorities praise and crown them, 
so that the others may take an example from it; not that 
one wants to earn something from it before God. So Paul 
also says Rom. 13, 3: "Authority is not set apart for good 
works, but for evil. Therefore, if you do not want to fear 
violence, do good." 


V. 15. For this is the will of God, that with 
benevolence ye should stop up the ignorance of 
foolish men. 


With these words St. Peter silences the useless 
talkers who boast of the Christian name and status, and 
refutes that they would object here and say: Since a 
Christian has enough faith, and works do not make him 
pious, what need is there that one should be subject to 
the temporal power, and give interest or womb? And so 
he says, "Even though we have no benefit from it, we 
should still do it freely to please God, so that the mouths 
of the enemies of God who reproach us may be shut; so 
that they can raise nothing against us, and must say that 
we are pious, obedient people. Thus we read of many 
saints, 1) that they went to war among the heathen 
princes and slew the enemies, and were submissive and 
obedient to them, 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. X, 389 f.: "as one writes of St. 
Moritz, Achatius, Gereon and of many others under the emperor 
Julian". 





just as well as we owe obedience to Christian authorities; 
although it is now thought that we could not be Christians 
fine if we were under the Turk. 

71) Now you might say here: Didn't Christ command 
[Matth. 5, 39] that one should not resist the evil, but if one 
gives us a stroke on one cheek, we should also offer the 
other; how can we then strike and choke other people? 
Answer: In the past the pagans also reproached the 
Christians, saying that if such a thing should arise, their 
regiment would have to perish. 2) But to this we say: It is 
true that Christians should not resist evil for themselves, 
nor take revenge when they are harmed, but should 
suffer injustice and violence. Therefore they cannot be 
hard on unbelievers. But this does not forbid the 3) 
authorities to use the sword. For although the pious 
Christians are not allowed to use the sword and the law 
(since they live in such a way that no one can complain 
about them, they do no wrong to anyone, but do good to 
everyone, and gladly suffer everything that is done to 
them), the sword must nevertheless be used for the sake 
of the unbelievers, so that the latter, if they harm others, 
may be punished, so that common peace may be 
preserved and the pious protected. God has provided a 
different regime, so that those who do not want to abstain 
from doing wrong themselves are forced by force not to 
do harm. 

For this reason God has ordained the authorities for 
the sake of the unbelievers, so that Christian people may 
also wield the power of the sword, and are obliged to 
serve their neighbor with it and to force the wicked, so 
that the pious may remain in peace before them. And yet 
Christ's saying remains that one should not resist evil; 
that is, that a Christian, even if he wields the sword, does 
not need it for himself, nor avenges himself, but only for 
others. And is this also the work of Christian love, that 
one protects and defends a whole congregation with his 
sword, and not

do. Thus they make Christian liberty only a cover under 
which they do vain shame, and defile the noble name and 
title of liberty which Christians have. This is what St. 
Peter is trying to say here, for he wants to say: "Although 
you are free in all outward things (if you are Christians) 
and should not be forced by laws to be subject to worldly 
authority, since no law has been given to the righteous 
(as we have said), you should nevertheless do it willingly 
and freely of yourselves; not as if you had to do it out of 
necessity, but to please God and to serve your neighbor. 
In the same way Christ Himself did, when we read Matth. 
17, 24. ff., that He gave the interest, when He was not 
allowed to do so, but was free and a Lord over all things. 
So he also submitted to Pilato and let himself be judged, 
when he himself said to him [Joh. 19, 11]: "You would 
have no power nor authority over me, if it was not given 
to you from above", with which words he _ himself 
confirmed the authority and therefore submitted to it, so 
that it would please his father. 

From this you see that this group does not belong to 
Christian freedom at all; those who do not do what the 
world wants or what God wants remain in the old 
disorderly way, even though they boast of the gospel. We 
are free from all laws, but we must also spare the weak 
and unlearned Christians, which is a work of love. 
Therefore Paul says, Rom. 13, 8: "You owe nothing to 
anyone, except to love one another." Therefore, whoever 
wants to boast of freedom, let him do beforehand what a 
Christian should do, namely, that he serves his neighbor, 
and then, when the pope or someone else proposes his 
commandment 1) to him and wants to urge him to keep 
it, let him say, "Dear Squire Pope, | will not do it for this 
very reason, because you want to make a commandment 
out of it for me and encroach on my freedom; for we 
should act in freedom as servants of God (as St. Peter 
says here), not as servants of men. Peter speaks), not 
as servants of men. Otherwise, where someone desires 
it from me, 


1) In the German editions (also in the second editing): "sein Gebot". 
Bucer: surn suis volst H Ziiius eonstrinAsrs. 





whom | might serve with it, | will gladly do it of good will, 
not considering whether it is commanded or not, but for 
the sake of brotherly love, and that it thus pleases God 
that | serve my neighbor. So | do not want to be forced 
to be subject to worldly rulers and lords, but | want to do 
it myself; not because they command me, but to serve 
my neighbor. So let all our works be that they flow from 
desire and love, and let them all be directed toward our 
neighbor, because we may not do anything for ourselves 
that we may become godly. Further follows: 


V. 17. Be respectful toward everyone. 

This is not a commandment, but a__ faithful 
admonition. We owe honor to everyone, even though we 
are free; for freedom does not extend to wrongdoing, but 
only to good deeds. Now we have often said that every 
Christian by faith obtains all things that Christ himself 
has, and so becomes his brother. Therefore, as | give all 
glory to the Lord Christ, so | should also do to my 
neighbor. This is not only in outward gestures, such as 
leaning toward him and the like, but rather inwardly in 
the heart, that | think much of him, as | think much of 
Christ. We are the temple of God, as St. Paul says in 1 
Cor. 3, 16, because the Spirit of God dwells in us. If we 
kneel before a monstrance and the image of the holy 
cross, why should we not do so much more before a 
living temple of God? St. Paul also teaches us in 
Romans 12:10 that one should precede the other with 
reverence, so that each one should sit down under the 
other and lift him up. The gifts of God are manifold and 
unequal, so that one is in a higher position than another; 
but no one knows which is the highest in the sight of 
God, for he can lift one who is in the lowest position here 
to the highest there. Therefore, even if each one sits 
high, he should throw himself down and offer honor to 
his neighbor. 

Love the brotherhood.

separate from one another the common and the 
commoner.

Love and brotherly love. We are obliged to love even our 
enemies, that is the common Christian love; but 
brotherly love is that we Christians love one another as 
brothers, and take care of one another, since we all have 
the same goods from God. This love is especially 
demanded by St. Peter. 


Fear God, honor the King, 


80 He does not say that one should think much of 
lords and kings, but that one should still honor them, 
even though they are Gentiles; just as Christ did, and the 
prophets who fell at the feet of the kings of Babylon. 

But here you want to speak: Here you see that one 
should also be obedient to the pope and fall at his feet? 
Answer: Yes, if the pope assumes temporal authority 
and acts like another overlord, one should also be 
obedient to him; as if he were to say, "| command you to 
wear a cap or a plate; item: to fast on this day; not that it 
counts for anything before God, nor that it is necessary 
for salvation, but because | want it so, as a temporal lord. 
But if he comes here and says, "| command you to do 
this in God's stead, that you accept it as if it came from 
God Himself, and stop at the ban and a mortal sin," then 
you say: | do not want to do it. We are to be subject to 
authority and do what they say, because they do not bind 
our conscience and only command outward things, even 
if they ride along with us as tyrants. For he that taketh 
away our skirts, let us also leave our coats [Matt. 5:40]. 
But if they want to take hold of the spiritual regime and 
capture the conscience, in which God alone must sit and 
rule, one should not obey them at all and also let go of 
the neck over it. 

(82) The temporal realm and regiment extends no 
further than to external and bodily things; but the pope 
not only takes this to himself, but also wants to have the 
spiritual [regiment], and yet does not have any; for his 
realm is nothing other than clothes, food, endowments 
and benefices, which belong neither to the temporal nor 
to the spiritual regiment.

For what is the world improved by it? It is against God to 
make it sin and good works, since there are none; 
therefore Christ cannot suffer it. But the worldly 
government he can well suffer, since it does not concern 
itself with sins nor good works and spiritual things, but 
has to do with other things, such as how to keep and 
fortify cities, build bridges, establish customs, take 
taxes, keep escorts, protect land and people and punish 
evildoers. Therefore, a Christian may well obey such a 
prince (provided that he does not make a commandment 
to his conscience), and does so freely, since he is free 
in all things. 

Therefore, if an emperor or prince should ask me now 
what my faith is, | should ask him, not for the sake of his 
territory, but that | am obliged to confess my faith publicly 
before everyone. But if he would go further and 
command me to believe otherwise or so, then | shall say: 
Dear Lord, wait thou thy worldly rule, thou hast no power 
to take hold of GOD in his kingdom, therefore | will not 
obey thee at all. You cannot suffer anyone to encroach 
on your territory; if someone crosses your path without 
your will, you shoot with guns afterwards; do you think 
that God should suffer that you want to push him off his 
throne and put yourself in his place? St. Peter calls the 
worldly authorities only a human order; therefore they 
have no power to fall into God's order and to command 
by faith. Let that be said enough of it. Now continue in 
the epistle: 

V. 18-20. Servants of the house, be subject to the 
lords with all fear, not only to the kind and gentle, 
but also to the unkind. For this is mercy, if anyone 
bears grief for the sake of conscience toward God, 
and suffers with unrighteousness. For what price is 
this, if ye suffer strokes for iniquity? But if you suffer 
and endure for the sake of good deeds, that is grace 
with God. 


St. Peter has now taught how we should be subject 
to secular authority,

We have said how far their authority stretches, so that it 
does not reach into the things that belong to the faith. 
This is said of the authorities in general, and is a lesson 
for everyone. But now he goes on and speaks of such 
authority, which does not extend over a congregation, 
but only to particular persons. First, he teaches how the 
household should behave toward their masters, and this 
is the opinion: 

Servants and maids are Christians as well as other 
people, because they have the word, faith, baptism and 
all goods just like everyone else. Therefore, they are as 
great and high before God as others. But according to 
their outward nature and before the world, there is a 
difference in that they are inferior and must serve others. 
Therefore, because they are called to the status of God, 
they should let this be their office, that they are subject 
to their masters, and look after them and take care of 
them. Therefore also the prophet David gives a fine 
similitude, and shows how they should serve well, Psalm 
123:2: "As the servant's eyes look on the master's 
hands, and as the maid looks on her wife's hands; so are 
our eyes upon thee." That is servants and maids should 
do with humility and fear what the master or the wife 
wants; that is what God wants, therefore one should do 
it gladly. You can be sure and certain that it will please 
God and be pleasing to Him if you do it in faith. 
Therefore, these are the best good works that you can 
do; you must not run far after others. What your master 
or wife calls you, that God Himself has called you. It is 
not a commandment of men, though it is done by men. 
Therefore do not consider what you have for a lord, good 
or bad, kind or angry and rude, but think thus: The Lord 
be what he wills, and | will serve him, and do this in honor 
of God, because he wills it of me, and because my Lord 
Christ himself became a servant for my sake. 

This is the righteous doctrine that should always be 
practiced, which unfortunately has now been hushed up 
and died out. But no one does this, except the 
Christians. For the gospel preaches only to those who 
accept it. Therefore, do you want to be God's child? 





If you want to be a servant, put it in your heart that you 
serve as if Christ himself called you. As St. Paul also 
teaches in Eph. 6:5, 6, 7: "Servants, be obedient to your 
physical masters, as to the Lord Christ, not with service 
only in mind, as pleasing men, but as servants of Christ, 
doing the will of God from the heart with willingness. Let 
it seem to you that you serve the Lord and not men" 2c. 
So he also says Col. 3, 24: "For ye serve the Lord 
Christ." 

If priests, monks and nuns were now in such a state, 
how should they thank God and be happy. For none of 
them can say: God has commanded me to keep mass, 
to sing matins, to pray the seven times, and the like; for 
they have no word of this in the Scriptures. Therefore, if 
you ask them whether they are sure and certain that their 
position is pleasing to God, they say no. But if you ask a 
lowly maid why she washes the dishes or milks the 
cows, she can say, "| know that what | do is pleasing to 
God, because | have God's word and command. This is 
a great good and a precious treasure that no one is 
worthy of; a prince should thank God that he could do 
such things. It is true that he can also do in his state what 
God wants him to do, namely, to punish the wicked. But 
when and how seldom does it happen that he can 
perform such an office properly? But in this state 
everything is so skillful that they can know, when they do 
what they are told, that it is all pleasing to God. God does 
not look at the works, how small they are, but at the heart 
that serves Him with such small works. But it is the same 
here as in other matters: What God has commanded, no 
one does; what men build up, and God does not give, 
everyone follows. 

88 You say: How then, if | have such a strange and 
angry Lord, to whom no one can give thanks, as many 
such people are found? To this St. Peter answers: "If you 
are a Christian and want to please God, then you must 
not ask how strange and unrighteous your Lord is, but 
always turn your eyes and see what God gives you. 
Therefore you shall think thus: | will serve my Lord Christ 
with this, and he will have it of me, that | may serve the 
Lord.

item, v. 5: "By which weal ye were healed." Christ was 
so pure that not an evil word was on his tongue. He 
deserved that everyone would have fallen at his feet and 
carried him on their hands; he would also have had the 
power and the right to take revenge: nor did he allow 
himself to be reproached, mocked, blasphemed and 
killed, and never opened his mouth; why then should 
you not also suffer it, since you are a vain sinner? You 
should praise God and give thanks that you are worthy 
to be like Christ, and not grumble or be impatient when 
you are harmed, because the Lord did not reproach or 
condemn, but prayed even for his enemies. 

You may speak like this: How then shall | justify them 
that do me wrong, and say that they have done well? 
Answer, No; but thus shalt thou say: | will gladly suffer it 
with my heart, though | have not deserved it, and thou 
hast wronged me, for my Lord's sake, who also hath 
suffered wrong for me. You shall bring it home to God, 
who is a righteous judge, who will repay you abundantly, 
just as Christ sent it home to His heavenly Father. "He 
who sacrificed our sins in his own body" (says St. Peter), 
that is, he did not suffer for himself, but for us, who 
crucified him with our sins; we are still far from it. 
Therefore, if you are a devout Christian, you should 
follow the Lord and let yourself mourn for those who 
harm you, and also pray for them that God will not 
punish them. For they do far more harm to their souls 
than they do to your body. If 


If you would take this to heart, you should forget your 
sorrow and suffer gladly. Then we should consider that 
before we were also in such an unchristian nature, like 
them, but now we have been converted through Christ, 
as St. Peter concludes and says: 


v.2. You would have been like sheep going astray, 
but you are now converted to the Shepherd and 
Bishop of your souls. 


This is a saying from the prophet Isaiah, who says: 
"We have all gone astray as sheep, and each one has 
gone his own way. But now we have come upon a 
shepherd (says St. Peter), the Son of God came for our 
sake, that he might be our shepherd and bishop; who 
gives us his Spirit, feeds us and guides us with his word, 
so that we now know how we are helped. Therefore, if 
you know that through him your sins have been taken 
away, you are his sheep, he is your shepherd; item, he 
is your bishop, you are his soul. Now this is the comfort 
that all Christians have. 

96 Thus we have two chapters in this epistle, in which 
St. Peter first taught righteous faith; then righteous 
works of love; and he spoke of two kinds of works. First, 
what we should all do in general toward the worldly 
authorities; then, how the household should behave 
toward their masters. And what St. Peter says here 
about household servants also extends to several other 
persons, namely craftsmen, day laborers and all kinds 
of hired servants. Now he will go on to teach how 
husband and wife should behave toward each other in a 
Christian manner. 


The third chapter. 


V. 1-6. Let the wives be like their husbands, so that 
even those who do not believe in the word may be 
won over by the way wives walk without the word, 
when they see your chaste walk in fear. What 
adornment is not in the hair by heart? 


The saintly woman is not the one who weaves and 
wears the cloak of gold or puts on the garments, but 
the hidden man of the heart in the immutability of a 
gentle and quiet spirit, which is glorious in the sight 
of God. For this is how the holy women of old 
adorned themselves, who placed their hope in God. 


1050 Erl. 51, 4L7-4LS. 


Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 750-753. 


1051 





And were subject unto their husbands, as Sarah 
obeyed Abraham, and called him lord, whose 
daughters ye have become, if ye do good, and fear not 
some abomination. 1) 


1 Here St. Peter speaks primarily of the women who 
had pagan and unbelieving husbands at that time; and 
again he says of the believing men who had pagan 
wives. For it often happened in those days, when the 
apostles preached the gospel among the Gentiles, that 
one was a Christian and the other was not. Since it was 
then commanded that women should be subject to men, 
how much more must it be so now. Therefore it should 
be the woman's work (St. Peter says) that she is subject 
to her husband, even if he is already a pagan and 
unbelieving. And he gives the reason why this should 
happen: 


So that even those who do not believe in the word 
may be won over by the way women walk without a 
word, when they see your chaste walk in fear. 


(2) This is when a man sees that his wife is so 
righteous and so good that he is stirred up to the faith 
and considers the Christian state to be a right good state. 
And even though women themselves are not 
commanded to preach, they should nevertheless 
conduct themselves in such a way with their gestures 2) 
and behavior that they thereby provoke men to the faith. 
As we read 3) of St. Augustine's mother, who converted 
her husband before his death, because he was a pagan, 
and then also her son Augustinum. Now this is still an 
external thing, which one should not do in order to 
become pious. For obedience does not make you 
blessed; for you may well find an obedient wife who is 
unbelieving. But for this reason you should do it, so that 
you may serve your husband. For thus God has decreed, 
Gen. 3:16, when he says to the woman, "You shall cower 
before your husband, and he shall be your master." 
Which is also one of the punishments that he has laid on 
the wives. But such (I say) is the outward walk, belonging 
to the body, not to the spirit.

(3) Now this is a great thing, to know what works to 
do to please God; we should run far after it, as we see 
that the world has run after that which it has devised. 
This is a high, noble treasure that a woman can have, if 
she holds herself thus, that she is subject to the man, 
that she is sure that her work pleases God; what can 
happen to her that is more joyful? Therefore, if she 
wants to be a Christian woman, she should think like 
this: | will not consider what kind of husband | have, 
whether he is a Gentile or a Jew, pious or wicked; but | 
will consider that God has made me a wife, and | will be 
subject and obedient to my husband. After that, all her 
works are golden, if she stands in such obedience. 

(4) But she who will not let this provoke her, nothing 
else will help. For by beating you will do nothing to make 
a woman pious and subdued. If you beat one devil out, 
you beat two of them in (as they say). Oh, if the people 
who are in wedlock knew such things, how well they 
would stand! But what God has commanded, no one 
likes to do; but what men have devised, everyone runs 
to. God wanted to keep this commandment so firmly that 
he also gave men the power to dissolve vows that wives 
had made if they did not like it, as we read in Numbers 
30:7 ff, so that it would only be peaceful and quiet in a 
house. That is one piece. Now the apostle goes on to 
say how a woman should behave toward other people. 


V. 3. 4. Which adornment is not by heart in the 
braiding of hair and the cloak of gold or the putting 
on of garments, but the hidden man of the heart in 
the immutability of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is 
glorious in the sight of God. 

(5) This treasure shall not only be for a woman, but 
also for a man who is inward. 

But here someone would like to ask: whether it is 
commanded or not, that St. Peter says of the jewelry. 
We read from Esther sEsth. 2, 12. 17. pieces in Esth. 3, 
11.], 4) that she had a 


4) Cf. Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1361, § 154. 


1052 Eri. 5i, 4L9-431. First edition. Sermon on I Petr. 3, 3-6. 


W. ix. 753-756. 1053 





wore a crown of gold and fine ornaments, as befits a 
queen; so also of Judith [Judith 10:3 ff]. But this is 
written, that they despised the ornaments, and had to 
wear them. Therefore we say also thus: A woman 
should be so minded that she respects not the jewelry. 
Otherwise, when the people are attracted to jewelry, 
they do not stop wearing it; that is their nature and 
manner; therefore they should despise a Christian 
woman. But if a man wants her to be adorned, or if there 
is any other good reason for her to be adorned, she will 
do so. But she should be adorned in this way (as St. 
Peter says here), so that she is adorned inwardly, in a 
gentle and quiet spirit. You are pretty enough adorned 
when you are adorned for your husband; Christ does not 
want you to adorn yourself for the sake of pleasing other 
people, and to be called a pretty maid. But then you shall 
see how you bear the hidden treasure and precious 
ornament in your heart, in immutability (as St. Peter 
says), and lead a fine honorable, chaste life. 

7) It is a good sign, 1) that there is not much spirit, 
where one puts so much emphasis on the adornment; 
but if there is faith and spirit, he will trample it underfoot, 
and say like the queen Esther [pieces in Esther Cap. 3, 
11]: Lord, you know that | consider the crown, which | 
wear on my head, as an abomination, and must thus 
adorn myself; if | did not have to do it for the love of my 
king, | would rather trample it underfoot. Where there is 
such a woman, she will please the man all the more. 
Therefore they should think to adorn the inner man, 
where there is a quiet spirit, which is immovable; not only 
that they do not run away, so that they do not go mad 
and become disgraced, but so he means, that they see 
to it that the soul inwardly remains immovable in the right 
faith, so that the same is not violated. 

(8) Hence comes such a heart that does not break 
out and think how it will be seen before the world. Such 
a heart is a splendid thing in the sight of God. If a woman 
adorns herself with precious gold, precious stones and 
pearls down to her feet, that would be splendid beyond 
measure. 


1) In the Weim. In the Weim. edition: "antzeygen"; but in the 
second edition: "Es ist ein gewiB Anzeichen. 





But you cannot attach so much to a woman as to 
compare it to the exuberant adornment of souls, which 
is splendid in the sight of God. Gold and precious stones 
are glorious in the sight of the world, but in the sight of 
God they are a stink. But she who walks in a quiet and 
gentle spirit is well and gloriously adorned before God. 
Therefore, because God Himself considers it splendid, 
it must be a glorious thing. 

9 A Christian soul has all that Christ has. For faith (as 
we have said [Cap. 1, § 16)) brings us all the goods of 
Christ together. This is a great, precious treasure and 
such an ornament that no one can praise enough; God 
Himself also thinks much of it. Therefore, women are to 
be abstained from jewelry and irritated, because they 
are otherwise inclined to it. If a Christian woman hears 
this and lets it go to her heart, and thinks: | do not want 
to respect jewelry, because God does not respect it; but 
if | have to wear it, | will do it for my husband's sake, then 
she is rightly adorned and adorned in spirit. Then St. 
Peter also gives an example of holy women, that he 
stimulates the women to Christianity, and says: 


V. 5. 6. For so did the holy women of old adorn 
themselves, who put their hope in God, and were 
subject to their husbands, as Sarah was obedient to 
Abraham, and called him lord. 


010 As the same women adorned themselves, so did 
ye when Sarah obeyed her Abraham, and called him her 
lord. So the Scripture says Gen 18:10, 12, when the 
angel came to Abraham and said, "This day about a year 
Sarah shall have a son. Then she laughed, and said 
thus, Because | am old, and my lord also is old, shall | 
yet deal with pleasure?" St. Peter took a good look at 
this saying and brought it here, because she would not 
have called Abraham a lord if she had not been his 
subject and kept him in mind. Therefore he says further: 


What daughters you have become, if you do good 
and do not fear some monster. 


(11) What does he mean by this? This is what he 
means: It is the common nature of women to 


1054 en. si, 431-434. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. ix, 756-759. 


1055 





Shun and fear all things, therefore they practice so much 
sorcery and superstition, since one teaches the other 
that it is not to be counted what they have for magic. 1) 
But a Christian woman should not do this, but should 
walk freely, safely, not be so creepy, and run to and fro, 
speaking a blessing here, a blessing there; as it comes 
to her, that she may let God rule, and think that it cannot 
go badly for her. For since she knows how she is, that 
her state pleases God, what will she fear? If your child 
dies, you will be ill; well, command God; you are in the 
state that pleases God, what better can you desire? This 
is now preached to the women. Now follows what the 
men should do. 


V. 7. like them, you men, dwell with them with 
reason, and give honor to the female, as the weakest 
instrument, as also joint heirs of the grace of life, so 
that your prayers will not be hindered. 


12) The woman is also God's equipment or 
instrument (he says), for God needs her to bear children, 
to give birth, to nourish and wait, and to rule the house; 
such works the woman is to do. Therefore, she is God's 
stuff and vessel, who created her for this purpose and 
implanted it in her. For this the man should look upon his 
wife. That is why St. Peter says: "You men should live 
with your wives with reason", not that you want to rule 
them according to your mad head. They are to live as 
the man governs them, what he calls them and creates, 
so that the same is done; but he is also to see how he 
deals with her neatly and with reason, so that he spares 
her and gives her honor, as the weakest instrument of 
God. 

The man is also God's armor, but he is stronger; but 
the woman is weaker in body and more stupid and timid 
in spirit. Therefore, you must deal with her in such a way 
that she can bear it. You must deal with her as with other 
things, so that you may work. If you want to have a good 
knife, you do not have to cut stone with it. Now there is 
no rule for this; God makes it up to each man himself to 
deal with the woman according to the law. 


1) Cf. Walch, old edition, Vol. Ill, 1706, § 19 ff. 





for which every woman is skilled. For you do not need to 
use the power you have as you wish, for you are her 
husband because you help her, keep her and protect 
her, not because you destroy her. The goal cannot be 
set for you; you must know for yourself how you should 
proceed with reason. 

(14) Now we also have from husbands what good 
works they should do that please God, namely, that they 
dwell with their wives and feed them and deal with them 
cleanly. It will not always be possible to go straight as 
you would like. Therefore see to it that you are a man 
and have all the more sense where there is too little ina 
woman. At times you must look through your fingers, let 
up a little and give way, and also give the woman her 
honor. 

15 "Honor" has been interpreted, but | do not know 
how. Some have interpreted it to mean that the husband 
should provide food, drink and clothing for the wife, and 
feed her; others have taken it to mean marital duty. | 
think that this is the opinion, as | have said, that the 
husband should regard the wife in this way, so that she 
is also a Christian and God's work or equipment. And so 
they should both hold it that the woman holds the man 
in honor, and again the man also gives his honor to the 
woman. If they were thus able, it would go well in peace 
and love; otherwise, where art is not, there is vain 
unkindness in marriage. Therefore, when husband and 
wife take each other for the sake of pleasure alone, and 
think they want to have good days and pleasure, they 
find heartache. But if you consider God's work and will, 
you can live a Christian life in marriage, not like the 
pagans, who do not know what God wants. 


As also joint heirs of the grace of life. 


(16) The man must not consider that the woman is 
weak and infirm, but that she also is baptized, and has 
the very things that he has, namely, all the goods of 
Christ. For inwardly we are all equal, and there is no 
difference between man and woman; but outwardly God 
would have the man reign, and the woman be subject to 
him.

W. IX, 75S-76l. 





That your prayers may not be hindered. 


What does St. Peter mean by this? This is what he 
means: If you do not act with reason, but murmur and 
grumble, and with your head through it, and it is also 
frail, so that neither can provide and credit the other with 
anything, then you will not be able to pray and say: 
Father, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive. With 
prayer we must fight against the devil; therefore we must 
be one among ourselves. Now these are the right, 
delicious good works that we should do. If this were 
preached and known, we would all have a house full of 
good works at home. So now we have heard how a 
Christian should conduct himself in all kinds of 
circumstances, especially one against another. Now 
follow on, how we are all to lead a Christian walk 
outwardly through one another in common. 


Finally, all of you be like-minded, compassionate, 
brotherly, affectionate, friendly, not repaying evil 
with evil, not repaying evil with evil, but on the other 
hand, praising, and knowing that you are called to 
this, to pray for praise. For whosoever will love life, 
and see good days, let him hold his tongue, that it 
speak no evil; and his lips, that they deceive not. Let 
him turn from evil and do good; let him seek peace 
and pursue it. For the eyes of the LORD are upon the 
righteous, and his ears upon their prayer: but the 
face of the LORD is upon them that do evil. 


(18) All this is not said otherwise than that we should 
love one another. For here it is widely deleted, which 
otherwise the Scripture comprehends in few words. 
Thus St. Peter means to say, "This is the summa 
summarum of how you are to conduct yourselves in the 
outward life, so that you may be like-minded. The 
apostles Peter and Paul often use this word, and so 
much is said that we should all have one mind, one 
courage, one conceit, which seems right and good to 
one, so that it also seems right and good to the others. 
It is an excellent, remarkable word, which should ever 
be well grasped; St. Paul has written especially much 
about it. 





(19) We cannot all do one work, but every man must 
do one thing for himself; a man another than a woman; 
the servant another than the master, and so on. And it is 
a foolish thing to teach that we should all do one work; 
as the foolish preachers have done, who preach the 
legends of the saints, that this saint has done one work, 
that another another, and fall to saying that we should do 
the works also. There is no doubt that Abraham did a 
good, delicious work when he sacrificed his son, 
because he was specially commanded to do so by God. 
Then the pagans came and wanted to sacrifice their 
children as well; this was an abomination in the sight of 
God. Thus King Solomon also did well in building the 
Temple, and was well rewarded by God. Now our blind 
fools also go and preach that we must build churches 
and temples for God, when nothing of this has been 
commanded to us by God. So it is now the other way 
around, that people are doing all kinds of work and all 
kinds of senses, straight against the gospel. 

020 And so it ought to be taught that there should be 
one mind and many works, one heart and many hands; 
not all should do one work, but every man should wait for 
his own; otherwise there will not remain one mind and 
heart. That which is outward must be left in many ways, 
so that each man may keep that which he is 
commanded, and what works he has in hand. This is a 
righteous doctrine, and it is almost necessary to grasp it 
well; for the devil takes special care of it, and has also 
brought it about in this way, that people fall on their 
works, and each one thinks that his work is better than 
the other. That is why they were so divided among 
themselves, monks against priests, one order against 
the other, because each one wanted to do the best work. 
Then they fell in with the orders, thinking that the order 
was better than the other; the Augustinian against the 
preacher, 2) the Carthusian against the Barefoot, so that 
everything was divided, and nowhere was there greater 
disunity than among the orders.

1058 Erl. 51, 436-438. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 781-764. 


(21) If it had been taught that no work was better than 
another in the sight of God, but that they were all equal 
through faith, then the hearts would have remained one, 
and we would all have been of the same mind, and would 
have spoken thus: The order or rank that the bishop 
leads is not greater in the sight of God than that which a 
bad man leads; the rank that the nun leads is not better 
than that which a married woman leads, and so on in all 
kinds of ranks. But they do not want to hear this, but each 
one wants to be the best, and they say: Well, how should 
my position in the order not be better and greater than 
that of the common man? 

22Therefore, to have one mind is to hold each man's 
work equal to another's; as, that the marital estate is as 
good as the virginal estate. For all things are equal in the 
sight of God, who judges according to the heart and faith, 
not according to the person or works. Therefore we 
should also judge as God judges, so that we are of one 
mind and remain united in the world, and the hearts 
remain undivided, so that they do not divide on the 
outward appearance, so that | consider everything good 
and let myself be pleased with what each one does for 
works, if only it is not sin in himself. St. Paul also says of 
this in 2 Cor. 11:3: "I fear lest, as the serpent deceived 
Hevam, so also your minds be deceived from the 
simplicity of Christ," that is, lest the devil also deceive 
you, and rend and separate the simple mind that you 
have. Item Phil. 4, 7: "Let the peace of God, which 
passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds 
in Christ Jesus." Why does the apostle care so much 
about the mind? Everything depends on it. For if | fall into 
a wrong mind, all is already lost. For if 1am amonk, and 
have conceived such a mind that my work is worth more 
to God than to others, and say: Thanks be to God that | 
have become a monk, my status is now better than the 
common marital status, then pride must follow from the 
mind, and cannot remain outside, that | consider myself 
more pious than another, and despise other people; then 
| deceive myself. Fora 





1059 


A married woman, if she stands in faith, is better before 
God than | with my order. Therefore, knowing that faith 
brings with it all that a Christian should have, we all have 
one mind and opinion, and there is no difference among 
works. 

23 Therefore the saying of St. Peter must be 
understood in this way, that here he means spiritual, not 
outward senses, and an inward opinion or conceit, which 
concerns the things that are valid before God, that both 
the doctrine and the life are the same, and | consider just 
that to be good, which you consider to be good; and 
again, what pleases you is what pleases me, as | have 
said. Christians have the mind, and over the mind we 
are to hold fast, so that it does not go mad, as St. Paul 
says: "For if the devil goes mad in the mind, he has gone 
mad in the right virgin's castle, and after that all is lost. 


V. 8. Be compassionate, brotherly, cordial, 
friendly. 


24 "To be compassionate" means that one takes care 
of the other and lets his neighbor's distress go to his 
heart when it is bad for him, so that you do not think, 
"That is right! Where there is love, it takes care of the 
neighbor when he is in trouble, so that it goes to her 
heart just as if it were happening to herself. 

(25) But "to be brotherly" is so much that one holds 
the other as for his brother. Now this is easy to 
understand, for nature itself teaches it. There you see 
what true brothers are, that they stick together much 
harder than any other friends. So shall we Christians do 
also, for we are all brethren by baptism, that even father 
and mother after baptism are my brother and sister; for | 
have the same estate and inheritance which they have 
of Christ by faith. 


26 "Cordial," viscerosi. | cannot interpret this word 
otherwise than to give a simile. See how a mother or 
father acts toward the child; as when the mother sees 
her child suffering distress, because all the bowels and 
the heart in the body are moved. This is taken the way 
to speak in many places in the Scriptures, which is also 
a history in the 


1060 Eri. si, 438-tto. First edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 3, 8. W. ix, 764-767. 


1061 





Books of Kings, 1 Kings 3:16 ff. Two women were 
quarreling over a child before King Solomon, and one of 
them wanted to have the child. When the king wanted to 
know which was the child's real mother, he had to go 
into the countryside, where he found it and said to both 
wives, "You Say the child is yours, and you also say that 
it is yours; so get a knife and divide the child into two 
pieces, give one piece to the one and one to the other. 
Then he came to know which was the right mother. And 
there the text speaks, v. 26, that her bowels were moved 
over the child, and said, "Not, not! rather give the child 
to this one whole, and let it live." Then the king made a 
judgment and said: "This is the right mother, take it and 
give the child to her. Therefore you can take what this 
word "heartily" means here. 

27 This is what St. Peter wants us to do, to treat each 
other like true blood friends; just as the whole heart, 
marrow, veins and all powers are moved, so it should 
also be heartfelt and motherly here, and penetrate 
through the heart. One Christian man should bear such 
courage toward another. But the goal is truly ambitious; 
one will find very few of them who bear such a heartfelt 
love for their neighbor when they see that a need affects 
them, that they are moved as a mother over her child, 
so that it penetrates through the heart and through all 
the veins. There you see what monk and nun life and 
being fei, how far it is from such heartfelt love. If you 
were to melt them all together in one heap, you would 
not find one drop of such Christian love. Therefore, let 
us watch and take care of ourselves, whether we find 
such a kind of love in ourselves. It is a short sermon and 
soon said, but it goes deep and stretches far away. 

28 "Friendly" is that one outwardly leads a fine, 
sweet, lovely walk; not only that one takes care of the 
other, like father and mother of their child, but also that 
one deals with the other with love and gentleness. There 
are some musty and gnarled people, like a tree with 
many branches, so unkind that no one likes to deal with 
them. This comes from the fact that 





They are generally full of suspicion and soon become 
angry; no one likes to deal with them. But these are fine 
people, who interpret all things for the best, and are not 
suspicious, are not soon angered, can well hold 


something to their credit, and are called candidos. This 
virtue is called by St. Paul 


ypnototns [Rom. 2, 4.], and is often praised 
by him. 

29 Then behold the gospel, which so portrayeth the 
Lord Christ, that this virtue is peculiarly seen in him. Now 
and then the Pharisees attack him in this way, now and 
then, that they might see him; yet he will not be angered. 
Even though the apostles often stumble and stumble 
here and there, he still does not snort at them, but is 
always friendly, and so attracts them to him that they 
were glad to be with him from the heart and to deal with 
him. This is also seen among good friends and 
companions on earth; where there are two or three good 
friends who think well of each other: if one of them is 
foolish, the other can credit him. There it is also a little 
copied what St. Peter means here, although this is not 
righteous; for this kindness is to be offered to everyone. 
Therefore you see the right kind of love, and how a fine 
people it is around the Christians. The angels in heaven 
live like this through one another; it should also be like 
this on earth, but it happens very little. 

(30) Just as Saint Peter said that maidservants and 
servants, men and women, should keep themselves in 
such a way that each one should do the thing he is 
supposed to do, so he wants all of us to do it together. 
Therefore, if you want to be sure and certain that you are 
doing a good work that pleases God, let everything be 
done in God's name that has been preached in the 
devil's name, so that the world will go around and earn 
heaven. But how can you be sure that you are pleasing 
to God, if you do as he says here: "The works that one 
should do, the state that each one should lead, is to be 
compassionate, brotherly, cordial, friendly? There he 
says nothing of the foolish work of which we have been 
preached; does not say: Build churches, establish 
masses, become a priest, put on a cap, vow chastity 2c. 
But thus he says: Think 


1062 en. s1, 440-443. interpretations on the ‘st epistle of St. Peter. w. 1x, 767-76s. 


1063 





only that you may be kind. These are truly precious, 
golden works, precious stones and pearls that please 
God. 

(31) But the devil does not like to see this, for he 
knows that his thing will go down with it; therefore he 
thinks up what he can to suppress such teaching, and he 
judges monks and priests, so that they cry out: "If you 
say that our thing is nothing, that is the devil talking to 
you. Then say to them again: Do you not know that these 
must be good works, of which St. Peter says here, 
namely to be fraternal, cordial and friendly? If these are 
the best, as one must confess, then you must lie with 
your works if you think that they are better. | am quite 
surprised that such blindness has arisen among us. 
Thomas the preacher-monk wrote, 1) and says 
impudently that monks and clergymen are in a better 
state than common Christians. The high schools have! 
affirmed this and made doctors about it; after that the 
pope and his crowd have come and raised those to 
saints who teach such things. 

Thou therefore understand this, as | have said. Christ 
himself and all the apostles have taught that if you want 
to do the best good works and be in the best state, you 
will find nothing else but faith and love, which is the 
highest state. Therefore it must be a lie if they say that 
their position is better than faith and love. For if it is better 
than faith, it is better than God's word; if it is above God's 
word, it is above God Himself. Therefore Paul rightly said 
[2 Thess. 2, 4] that the end-Christ will rise above God. 
Know therefore how to judge these things: Where love 
and kindness are not, all works are surely condemned, 
and trample it all under foot. Thus we see how St. Peter’ 
has so bravely set forth how a righteous Christian life 
should stand according to outward nature, after he has 
masterfully taught above how the inward life should 
stand against God; therefore this epistle is to be 
considered a right golden epistle. Therefore now follows: 


1) That is, Thomas Aquinas. - Cf. Uromas Loounda 
soounaao, qu. 184, ai4. 5, and the whole doctrine Vom statns 
porteotionis. (Weim. ed.) 





V. 9 Do not repay evil with evil, not evil with evil, 
but rather pray, knowing that you have been called to 
pray. 

(33) This is another explanation of love, how we 
should do to those who insult and persecute us. If they 
do you evil (he means), you do good; if they rebuke and 
malign you, you benedict and bless. This is a great piece 
of love. O Lord God, how strange such Christians are! 

(34) But why should we give good for evil? Therefore 
(he says) that you are called to it, that you may inherit the 
blessing, that you may be provoked to it. In the Scriptures 
we Christians are called a people of blessing or the 
blessed people; for thus God says to Abraham Gen. 
12:3: "In your seed shall all the families of the earth be 
blessed." Since God has poured out this blessing on us 
so abundantly, that He might take away from us all 
malediction and the curse that we brought with us from 
our first parents, and which Moses also let pass over the 
unbelievers, so that we are now full of blessing, we 
should therefore consider ourselves to be said, "Yes, this 
is a blessed people. Therefore the apostle means this: 
"Behold, God has given you grace, and has taken away 
from you blasphemy, and has not reckoned or punished 
the blasphemy which you have committed against Him, 
but has given you such abundant grace and blessing in 
return, when you were worthy of all blasphemy, because 
you blaspheme God without ceasing (for where there is 
unbelief, the heart must always curse God): Therefore do 
ye even as it is done unto you; curse not, reproach not, 
do well, speak well, even when evil is done unto you, and 
suffer it when you are wronged. Then he brings up a 
saying from the 34th Psalm, v. 13 ff, where the prophet 
David says thus: 

V. 10 If any man love life, and see good days, let 
him hold his tongue from evil, and his lips from deceit. 

35 That is, Whosoever shall have pleasure and joy in 
life, and shall not surely die, but shall see good days, and 
it shall be well with him; let him hold his tongue, that it be 
not silent. 


1064 Eri. si, 443-445. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 3, 10-16. 


W. ix, 769-772. 1065 





Speak evil, not against friends only; for this is a small 
virtue, for even the most wicked can do it, even serpents 
and vipers; but thus he says, "Be of good cheer, and hold 
your tongue, even against your enemies, even if you are 
provoked to rebuke and speak evil. 

Thirty-six: For this hold not thy lips, that they be not 
deceitful. There are many who speak good words and 
say "good morning" to their neighbor, but in their heart 
they think that the devil will get you. These are people 
who have not inherited the blessing, they are evil fruits 
of the evil tree. That is why Peter introduced a saying 
that is about works, but it is drawn to the root, that is, 
inwardly to the heart. Further the saying in the prophet, 
v. 15. 16. says: 


V. 11, 12: He shall turn from evil, and do good; he 
shall seek peace, and pursue it: for the eyes of the 
LORD look upon the righteous. 


(37) This is what the world takes for peace, when one 
wronged another by striking him on the head. But this is 
no way to achieve peace, for no king has ever been able 
to achieve peace in the face of enemies. The Roman 
Empire was so powerful that it struck down everything 
that opposed it; yet they could not keep it that way. 
Therefore this way is useless for peace. For if one 
enemy is put down and deceived, ten and twenty will rise 
up again after him until he is destroyed. But he that 
seeketh peace aright, and shall find it, that holdeth his 
tongue, and turneth from evil, and doeth good; that is 
another way than the world goeth. To turn from evil and 
do good is to hear evil words, to do evil and to do wrong. 
Seek peace, and you will find it when your enemy cools 
his temper and has done all he can; if you interrogate, 
rebuke, and rage not again, he must subdue himself with 
his own violence. For thus also Christ on the cross 
overcame his enemies, not with the sword or violence. 
Therefore there is a proverb which should be written with 
gold, which says: 





Striking again makes strife; and: Whoever strikes again is 
unjust. From this, in turn, must follow: Not striking again 
makes peace. How does that work? It is not human. Yes, 
of course, not human; but if you suffer injustice and do not 
strike back, but let it pass over, 1) it will be so; as follows 
hereafter: 


V. 12: The eyes of the LORD are upon the 
righteous, and his ears upon their prayer: but the face 
of the LORD looketh upon them that do evil. 


038 If thou revenge not thyself, and requite not evil for 
evil, the LORD is in heaven above, which cannot suffer 
iniquity. Therefore, he who does not repay must be right; 
these he looks upon, the same prayer is in his ears. He is 
our protector, he will not forget us, so we cannot fall out 
of his sight; we should take comfort in this. This is what 
should move a Christian man, that he should suffer all 
wrongs with patience, and not repay evil. When | think 
about it, | see that the soul of the one who harms me must 
burn eternally in the hellish fire. Therefore a Christian 
heart must say: Dear Father, because man falls so 
horribly into your wrath, and throws himself so miserably 
into the eternal fire, | ask that you forgive him, and also 
do to him as you did to me, as you saved me from the 
wrath. How is this done? Thus, as he looks upon the 
righteous by grace, so he looks sore upon the wicked, and 
wrinkles his countenance, and hath turned it in anger 
upon them. Knowing then that he looks upon us with 
favor, and upon them with disfavor, let us have mercy 
upon them, and let us mourn, and pray for them. St. Peter 
continues: 


V. 13-16 And who is there that can harm you if you 
do what is right? Blessed are ye, if ye also suffer for 
righteousness' sake. But do not be afraid of their 
defiance, nor be dismayed; but sanctify God the Lord 
in your heart. But be ye always ready 2) to answer to 
every man that requireth the cause of the

1067 








Hope that is in you, and that with meekness and fear, 
and have a good conscience, that they which speak 
evil of you, as of evildoers, may be put to shame, 
because they have mocked your good walk in Christ. 


39. if we do what is good, that is, do not repay evil 
with evil, but are cordial and kind, 2c. there is no one 
who can harm us. For though honor, body, and goods 
be taken from us, yet are we not hurt, because we have 
a good that is not to be compared with that which may 
be taken from us. Those who persecute us have nothing 
but goods on earth, after which they are eternally 
damned; but we have an eternal, imperishable good, 
even if we lose a little temporal good. 


V. 14: Blessed are you, if you also suffer for 
righteousness' sake. 


40 Not only can no one harm you if you suffer for 
God's sake, but you are also blessed and should rejoice 
that you suffer, as Christ also said in Matthew 5:11, 12: 
"Blessed are you when men revile and persecute you for 
my sake, and speak all kinds of evil against you, when 
they lie about it; rejoice and be glad. He who 
understands that the Lord says these things and speaks 
them so sweetly and comfortingly to the heart, is well; 
but he who is not strengthened by them, who is not 
made confident and courageous, will remain 
unstrengthened. 


V. 14. 15. But do not be afraid of their defiance, 
and do not be dismayed; but sanctify God in your 
heart. 


41: But St. Peter cites a saying from the prophet 
Isaiah, Cap. 8, 12, 13, where he says: "Do not be afraid 
of them, and do not be dismayed, but sanctify the Lord 
in your heart, and let him be your fear and your terror" 
2c. There we have a great protection and back, on which 
we may rely, that no one can harm us. Let the world 
terrorize, defy, and oppress as long as it will, it must 
have an end, but our comfort and joy will have no end. 
So we should not be afraid of the world, but be 
courageous, but before God we should humble 
ourselves and fear. 


But how does St. Peter mean that we should sanctify 
God? how can we sanctify him, must he not sanctify us? 
Answer: So we also pray in the Lord's Prayer: "Hallowed 
be your name", that we should hallow his name, since 
he himself hallows his name. Therefore, in your hearts 
(says St. Peter) you should sanctify him; that is, if our 
Lord God sends us something, whether it is good or bad, 
whether it is good or bad, whether it is shame, honor, 
happiness or misfortune, | should not only consider it 
good, but also consider it holy and say so: This is the 
most precious sanctuary, so that | am not worthy to be 
touched by it. Thus says the prophet Psalm 145:17: 
"Righteous is the LORD in all his ways, and holy in all 
his good works." If | praise God in such things, and 
consider such works good, holy, and delicious, | sanctify 
Him in my heart. 

(43) But those who run to the law books and 
complain that they are wronged, and say: God is asleep 
and will not help the right and prevent injustice; they 
dishonor Him and do not consider Him righteous or holy. 
But he who is a Christian shall make God right and 
himself wrong, and shall hold God holy, but himself 
unholy, and shall say that he is holy and right in all his 
doings and works. That is what he wants. Thus says the 
prophet Daniel, Cap. 9, 5, 7, 14: "O Lord, all that you 
have done to us you have done with right and true 
judgment, for we have sinned; therefore let the shame 
be ours, but the honor and the glory be yours. When we 


sing Deo gratias and Te Deum laudamus, and say: 
Praise and glory be to God, when we are afflicted, this 
is what Peter and Isaiah call sanctifying the Lord. 

44 But he does not mean that you should say that he 
who has offended you has done right and well. For there 
is much other judgment between God and me, and 
between me and you. | can have anger, hatred and evil 
desire in my heart, so that | do not harm you, then you 
are still unoffended and have nothing against me; but 
before God | am unjust, therefore he does right. If he 
punishes me, | deserve it; if he does not punish me, he 
shows me mercy, and thus he has done good in every 
way.

right. But it does not follow that he who persecutes me 
does right. For | have not wronged him, as | have done 
before God. When God sends the devil or evil men to 
punish you, he needs them to carry out his justice; so 
that evil men and injustice are also a good thing. 

45 Thus we read Ezek. 29, 19. 20. about King 
Nabuchodonosor, where God speaks through the 
prophet: "Do you not know that he was my servant and 
served me? Now (he says), | must give him a reward, 
but | have not yet paid it. Well, | will give him Egypt land, 
that shall be his reward." The king had no right to the 
land, but God was right to punish those through him. For 
in order that the wicked boys may also serve him and 
not eat the bread in vain, he gives them enough and lets 
them also serve him, so that they persecute his saints. 
Reason falls in and thinks that they are doing well and 
right, if he pays them here alone, gives them a lot of land 
here, and does it just so that they are his masters and 
persecute the pious Christians. But if thou sufferest and 
sanctifieth God, and sayest, Lord, be thou right, he 
casteth them into hell, and punisheth them that they 
have done wrong; but he taketh thee in grace, and giveth 
thee eternal blessedness. Therefore let him do it, and he 
will reward you. 

46 We have an example of Saint Job, 1) when all his 
cattle and his sons were slain, and all his goods were 
taken from him, he said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord 
hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so it is 
done; therefore his name be praised. And when his wife 
came, mocking him, and scolding him, saying [Cap. 2:9], 
"Behold, what hast thou now, abide now in thy godliness, 
praise GOD, and die?" he answered, v. 10, "Thou hast 
spoken as a foolish woman. If we have received good 
from God's hands, why will we not also take evil from 
Him? Therefore as it hath pleased Him, so hath He made 
it.""GOD gave it, and GOD took it away" (he says). Not: 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. X, 1872. 


1069 


God gave it, the devil took it away, 2) even though the 
devil had done it. The man has now sanctified the Lord 
rightly, therefore he is also so highly praised and 
commended by God. Now continue: 


But be ye always ready 3) to answer to every man 
that requireth the hope that is in you. 


We must confess here that St. Peter spoke these 
words to all Christians, priests, laymen, men and women, 
young and old, and of whatever rank they may be; 
therefore it should follow that every Christian should 
know the reason and cause of his faith, and be able to 
give cause and answer where it is necessary. Now it has 
been forbidden until now that the laity should not read the 
Scriptures. For the devil had a good grip on it, that he 
might tear people away from the Scriptures, and so 
thought: If | make the laity not read the Scriptures, | will 
then bring the priests away from the Bible into Aristotle, 
that they may wash what they will, so that the laity must 
hear what they preach to them. Otherwise, if the laity 
read the Scriptures, the clergy would also have to study, 
so that they would not be punished and overcome. But 
see what St. Peter says here to all of us, that we should 
give an answer and show the reason for our faith. If thou 
shalt die, | will not be with thee, neither will the pope be 
with thee; if then thou knowest not a reason of thy hope, 
and sayest, | will believe, as the Concilio, the pope, and 
our fathers believed, the devil will answer, Yea, how, if 
they err? then he hath won, and taketh thee into hell. 
Therefore, we must know what we believe, namely what 
God's word is, not what the pope or holy fathers believe 
or say. For you must not trust in any person, but in the 
mere word of God. 

48 Therefore, if someone attacks you and asks you, 
like a heretic, 4) why you believe that you will be saved 
by faith, answer: | have the Word of God and clear 
sayings of Scripture, such as St. Paul's Romans 1:17: 
"He who is saved by faith is saved by faith.

The righteous will live by his faith," and St. Peter above 
Cap. 2, 6. where he speaks of the living stone Christ 
from the prophet Isaiah Cap. 28:16: "He that believeth 
on him shall not be put to shame." Here | build myself 
up, and know that the word deceiveth me not. But if you 
say like other fools, "Well, we will listen to what the 
council decides, and we will stick to it," you are lost. 
Therefore thou shalt say, What inquire | after what this 
man or that man believeth or decideth; if the word of God 
be not preached, | will not hear it. 

49 Do you then say: It is such a confused thing that 
no one knows what to believe; therefore one must wait 
until it is decided what one should believe. Answer: In 
the meantime you will also go to the devil. For when it 
comes to the trains and you are to die, and you do not 
know what you are to believe, neither | nor no one can 
help you. Therefore you must know for yourself, and turn 
to no one, and remain firm in the word of God, if you 
want to escape hell. And it is necessary that even those 
who cannot read grasp and retain some clear sayings 
from the Scriptures, at least one or two, and stand firm 
on the foundation, as it is Genesis 12:3, where God says 
to Abraham: "Through your seed shall all the families of 
the earth be blessed. When you have grasped this, you 
can stand on it 1) and say: If pope, bishops and all 
concilia stood there and said otherwise, then | say thus: 
This is God's word, it stands firm to me and does not 
deny. What is to be given must be given through the 
seed. What is benedeien? It is to redeem from 
malediction, that is, from sin, death and hell. Therefore 
it follows from the saying: Whoever is not given through 
the seed must be lost; so my works and merits cannot 
help me to salvation. Item, so the saying also concludes 
St. Peter Cap. 2, 6: "He that believeth on the stone shall 
not be put to shame." If someone attacks you and 
demands the cause of your faith, answer: "There is the 
reason, | cannot lack it, therefore | do not ask anything 
about what the pope or bishops teach and conclude. 


1) st6nen - to support. 





If they were true bishops, they should teach the reason 
for the faith, so that all Christians would know it in 
common; so they go and cry out: The laity should not be 
allowed to read the Scriptures. 

50 Therefore, if it be asked thee, Whether thou wilt 
have the pope for a head? say, Yea, | will have him for a 
head, for a head of wicked men and knaves. There | 
have a saying of St. Paul, 1 Tim. 4, 1. 3.: "Teachers of 
devils will come, forbidding to marry, and to avoid the 
food that God has created." This has ever been 
forbidden by the pope, .as it is in the day. That is why he 
is the end Christian. For what Christ gives and teaches, 
he does against. What Christ makes free, the pope 
binds. If Christ says it is not sin, the pope says it is sin. 

(51) So then we must learn the cause and answer of 
faith, for it must come to this. If it does not happen here, 
it must happen at death. Then the devil will come forth 
and say: Why did you call the pope an end-Christian? If 
you are not prepared and know the reason, he has won. 
So here St. Peter says: Because you have now believed, 
you will have much persecution hereafter; but in 
persecution you must have hope and wait for eternal life. 
If you are now asked why you hope this, you must have 
God's word to build on. 

52 But the Sophists have also inverted the text, that 
one should overcome the heretics with reason and from 
the natural light of Aristotle, therefore that here in Latin it 


says rationem reddere, as if St. Peter meant that one 
should do it with human reason. Therefore they say that 
the Scriptures are much too weak to overthrow heretics; 
it must be done with reason and come from the brain, 
from which it must be proved that faith is right, since our 
faith is above all reason and only God's power. 
Therefore, if people do not want to believe, keep quiet; 
for you are not guilty of forcing them to believe that the 
Scriptures are God's book or word; it is enough that you 
give your reason. For if they do so, and say, Thou 
preachest not to hold the doctrine of men; yet 


1072 En. si,451-454. First edition. Sermon on | Petr. 


3, 15-18. w. ix, 780-782. 1073 








Peter and Paul, even Christ, have also been men. When 
you hear such people who are so blinded and hardened 
that they deny that this is God's word, or doubt it, then 
keep quiet, do not speak a word to them, and let them 
go; only speak thus: | will give thee reason enough from 
the Scriptures; if thou wilt believe it, it is good; if thou wilt 
not, | will give thee no more. Then you say: Well, then, 
God's word must stand with shame. You command God. 
Therefore it is necessary to understand this and to know 
how to deal with those who now stand up and pretend 
such things. Follows: 


V.16. And this with meekness and fear. 


(53) That is, when you are challenged and 
questioned about your faith, you should not answer with 
proud words, and carry the matter out with defiance and 
violence, as if you were uprooting trees, but with such 
fear and humility as if you were standing before God's 
judgment and answering. For if it should happen that you 
were summoned before kings and princes, and had 
prepared yourself for a time with proverbs, and thought 
thus: Wait, | will answer them rightly; then it may happen 
to you that the devil takes the sword out of your hands 
and gives you a blow, so that you stand with shame and 
have put on armor in vain, and may well take out of your 
hands the sayings that you have best conceived, so that 
you fail, even if you have it well in mind; for he has 
sensed your thoughts before. God allows this to happen, 
so that he may dampen your arrogance and make you 
humble. 

54 Therefore, if thou wouldest that such things should 
not befall thee, thou must stand in fear, and not rely upon 
thy strength, but upon the words and promise of Christ, 
Matt. 10:19, 20: "When they shall deliver you up, be not 
anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given 
you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that 
speak, but your Father's Spirit which speaketh by you." 
It is right that thou shouldest answer, that thou shouldest 
well prepare thyself with sayings out of the scriptures; 
but see that thou do not 





You must insist on it with a proud courage, otherwise 
God will tear the right, strong saying out of your mouth 
and memory, if you were otherwise equipped with all the 
sayings beforehand. Therefore fear belongs to it. But if 
thou art thus skillful, thou canst answer to princes and 
lords, and also to the devil himself. Only see to it that it 
is not man's trumpery, but God's word. 


And have a good conscience, that they which 
speak evil of you, as of evildoers, may be put to 
shame, because they have mocked your good walk in 
Christ. 


55 St. Peter also said about this above. We cannot 
ignore it, if we want to cling to the gospel, we must be 
blasphemed and condemned by the world, so that they 
think we are the most desperate of boys. Therefore, we 
should not allow ourselves to be challenged, but only 
fear God and have a good conscience. So let the devil 
and all the world rage and rage, let them rebuke us as 
they will, they will have to endure with shame that they 
have reproached and blasphemed us, when the day 
comes (as St. Peter said above, Cap. 2, 12), then we will 
be safe and endure with a good conscience. Now these 
are all beautiful and strong sayings that can comfort us 
and make us brave, and yet keep us in fear. 


V. 17. 18. For it is better, if it be the will of God, 
that ye should suffer for a good thing, than for a bad 
thing: for Christ also hath once suffered for our sins, 
the just for the unjust, that he might sacrifice us to 
God, being put to death according to the flesh, but 
quickened according to the Spirit. 


(56) It will not happen that those who go to heaven 
will have good days on earth, because those who do not 
go to heaven will not have good days. For it is ever laid 
up for all men, that God saith unto Adam Gen. 3:19, In 
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread." And to 
the woman, v. 16: "In pain you shall bring forth children." 
Since misfortune is laid upon us all, how much more 
must those bear the cross who wish to enter eternal life? 


1074 


Erl. 51, 454-458. 


len come. That is why he says: "Because God wills it so, 
it is better that you suffer for the sake of good. Those 
who suffer for iniquity have an evil conscience and have 
twofold punishment; but the Christians have it only half. 
They have suffering on the outside, but comfort on the 
inside. 

But he has set a goal here, as he also said above 
[Cap. 1, 6.]: "If so be it", so that those may be resisted, 
as the Donatists were, of whom Augustine writes, 1) who 
took such sayings, which sound of suffering, and killed 
themselves, threw themselves into the sea. God does 
not want us to seek misfortune and choose it ourselves. 
Go in faith and love; if the cross comes, accept it; if it 
does not come, do not seek it. Therefore the hot spirits 
do wrong, that they scourge and smite themselves, or 
choke themselves, and thereby seek to storm heaven. 
Paul also forbade this in Col. 2, 23, when he says of such 
saints who walk in self-chosen spirituality and humility 
and do not spare their bodies. We are to wait for the body 
so that it does not become too horny [Rom. 13, 14], but 
also not corrupt it, and we are to suffer when another 
sends us suffering, but not fall into it ourselves. This is 
what the little piece means: "If it is God's will"; if he sends 
it, then it is better; so you are more blessed and happier 
that you suffer for your own good. 


V.18. Since Christ also once suffered for our sins, 
the righteous for the unrighteous. 


(58) Again, St. Peter sets the Lord Christ before us 
as an example, always referring to the suffering of Christ, 
so that we should all follow the example, lest he should 
propose a special image to each class. For as Christ's 
example is set forth to every man in the whole 
community, so he also holds it forth to every man in the 
church, that every man, of what sort he may be, may 
follow it in all his life as it happens. And so he wants to 
say: Christ is

1075 


He also suffered for us who were unjust, but did not seek 
the cross, but waited until it was God's will that he should 
drink the cup; he should be our example, whom we 
follow. And especially St. Peter introduces the example 
here, so that he will now conclude, after he has 
instructed all classes, and will now further explain the 
suffering of Christ. 

59 But actually he speaks here: "Christ suffered once 
for us," that is, Christ bore much sin on him; but not so 
as to die specially for every sin, but once sufficed for all 
with one another. In this way he took away all the sin of 
those who come to him and believe in him; they are now 
free from death, just as he is free. 

(60) "The righteous for the unrighteous," as if to say, 
"Rather, we are to suffer, because we die for the 
righteous, who has no sin; but he died for the 
unrighteous for our sins. 


That he might offer us to God. 


(61) All this is said so that he may teach the quality 
of Christ's suffering, namely, that he did not die for his 
own sake, but that he sacrificed himself for us to God. 
How does this work? Did he not sacrifice himself? 
Answer: It is true that he sacrificed himself on the cross 
for all of us who believe in him. But in the same way he 
also sacrificed us, so that all who believe in him must 
also suffer with him and be killed according to the flesh, 
just as he was. Thus God has presented us as those who 
are alive in the spirit, and yet die in the flesh, as he says 
afterwards. So 2) we are one sacrifice with him; as he 
dies, so we also die according to the flesh; as he lives 
spiritually, so we also live in the spirit. 


And is dead according to the flesh, but made alive 
according to the Spirit. 

62 The word "flesh" is common in Scripture, as well 
as "spirit," and the apostles hold that

1076 Erl. 51, 456-458. first.edit. Sermon on 1 Pet. 3, 18-22. 


commonly the two against each other. Now this is the 
opinion that Christ by his suffering was taken from the 
life that is flesh and blood; as a man on earth, living in 
flesh and blood, walks and stands, eats, drinks, sleeps, 
wakes, sees, hears, grasps and feels, and lately what the 
suffering does, which is perishable, to the same Christ 


died. This is what St. Paul calls [1 Cor. 15, 44] corpus 


animale, that is, as an animal lives in the flesh, not 
according to the flesh, that is, in natural works that the 
body has; he died to such life, so that it ceased with him, 
and he is now set in another life, and made alive 
according to the Spirit, entered into a spiritual and 
supernatural life, which comprehends with itself the life 
completely that Christ now has in soul and body, so that 
he no longer has a fleshly body, but a spiritual body. This 
is how St. Paul expresses it. 

63. so shall we also be at the last day, when out of 
the flesh and blood shall come spiritual life; that my body 
and thine shall live without eating and drinking; they shall 
not beget children, neither digest, nor cast forth, neither 
shall they cast forth any such thing; but shall live inwardly 
according to the Spirit; and the body shall be 
transfigured, as the sun is now, and much more clearly: 
there shall be no natural flesh and blood, neither natural 
works, nor works of the flesh, which are found in the 
flesh. St. Paul also speaks of this in 1 Cor. 15, 45: "The 
first man, Adam, was made into a natural life, and the 
last into a spiritual life." And follows, v. 49.: "As we have 
borne 1) the image of the natural man, even so shall we 
bear the image of the spiritual man." From Adam we 
have all natural works, like the unreasoning animals, 
according to the five senses; but Christ is spiritual flesh 
and blood, not according to outward senses, sleeping 
not, waking not, yet Knowing all things, and being in all 
things. So shall we also be, for he is the firstfruits, 


dawning and primogenitura 2) (as Paul says) of spiritual 


life, Col. 1:18, that is, he is the first that is risen and come 
into spiritual life. So Christ now lives according to

W. IX, 785-787. 1077 
the spirit, that is, he is truly human but has a spiritual 
body. 

(64) Therefore the words here are not to be taken as 
separating the spirit from the flesh, but that the body and 
flesh are spiritual, and the spirit is in the body and with 
the body. For St. Peter does not mean here that the Holy 
Spirit raised Christ from the dead, but in general. As 
when | say: "the Spirit" "the flesh", 3) | do not mean the 
Holy Spirit, but the inward things which the Spirit does 
and which come from the Spirit. Follows now: 


V. 19-22. In the same he also went and preached to 
the spirits in prison, who were unbelieving in times 
past, when they once waited for the divine 
longsuffering, in the times of Noah, when they 
prepared the archa, in which few, that is, eight souls 
were kept by water; which now also makes you 
blessed in baptism, which is signified by that; not the 
putting away of filthiness from the flesh, but the 
covenant of a good conscience with God, through the 
resurrection of JESUS CHRIST, who is at the right 
hand of GOD, ascended into heaven, and subject unto 
him are the angels, and the mighty men, and the 
powers. 


This is a strange text and a darker saying than there 
is in the New Testament, so that | do not yet know for 
sure what St. Peter means. First of all, the words read as 
if Christ had preached to the spirits, that is, to the souls 
who had disbelieved in the past, when Noah built the ark. 
| do not understand this, nor can | interpret it; no one has 
interpreted it yet. But if someone wants to believe that 
Christ, after he died on the cross, came down to the souls 
and preached to them, | will not refuse. So it would like 
to suffer a mind; but | do not know whether St. Peter 
wants to say that. 

(66) But the words may well give such an 
understanding that the Lord Christ, having ascended into 
heaven, in the Spirit 

3) "the flesh" which is in the first edition is erased in almost all later 


editions because it was not understood. The meaning is: When | 
speak of "spirit" in contrast to "flesh", | do not mean the Holy Spirit 2c. 


1078 eri. si, 458-460. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. . W. ix, 787-79." 


1079 





and preached, but that his preaching was not bodily. For 
he speaketh not with a bodily voice, and doeth no more 
the natural works of the body. Therefore, just as it 
sounds that he preached to the spirits in the same 
spiritual life, so such preaching must also be spiritual 
preaching, which he does inwardly in the hearts and 
souls, so that he may not go with the body and preach 
orally. The text does not say that he 1) went down when 
he died to the souls and preached to them. For it says 
thus, "In the same", namely, when he was put to death 
according to the flesh and made alive according to the 
Spirit, that is, when he had given up being in the flesh 
and the natural works of the body, and had entered into 
a Spiritual being and life, as he is now in heaven, he went 
and preached. Now he has never again gone to hell, 
having taken on such a new nature; therefore it must be 
understood that he did this after the resurrection. 

(67) Since the words are intended to imply that they 
speak of spiritual preaching, let us keep in mind that St. 
Peter speaks of the ministry that Christ does through 
outward preaching. For he commanded the apostles to 
preach the gospel bodily; but besides the preaching, he 
himself comes and is also present spiritually, speaking 
and preaching into the hearts of the people; as the 
apostles speak the words orally and bodily into the ears. 
There he preaches to the spirits who are imprisoned in 
the devil's prison, so the 2) going is also to be 
understood spiritually, like the preaching. 

But that follows here: "To the spirits who were 
unbelieving before" 2c., we want to interpret the divine 
account, that in the being, as Christ is inside, before him 
equal 


1) Walch and the Erlanger (without external authority): "so". In all 
other editions, also in the second edition: "sei". To the first reading, 
the Weimar edition makes the remark: "This textual change arises 
from the interest in not having Luther deny the infernal journey." The 
beginning of § 72 proves that Luther did not deny the ascent into hell 
at that time either: Our faith insists "that Christ died, descended into 
hell, and rose from the dead. 

2) Second edit: "so that going." 


are, who were there before times and are now. Because 
his regiment stretches both over dead and living. And in 
that life the beginning, middle and end of the world is all 
in one lump. But here in the world it has a measure, that 
the time goes after each other, the son after the father, 
and so on. As that we give a likeness: If a piece of wood 
lies far from you, or if you look at it lengthwise, you 
cannot see it; but if it lies close to you, or if you stand on 
top of it and look at it crosswise, you can see it at all. So 
on earth we cannot comprehend this life, for it goes on 
from foot to foot until the last day, but before God it is all 
in a moment. For before Him a thousand years are as 
one day, as St. Peter says in the other epistle [Cap. 3, 
8]. So the first man is as near to him as he who is to be 
born at the last, and sees it all at once; as the eye of 
man can bring two things together in a moment, which 
are also far from each other. So now the opinion is that 
Christ no longer preaches bodily, but is present with the 
word and preaches to the spirits spiritually in the heart; 
but still it is not understood that he preaches to all spirits 
in this way. To which spirits did he preach? To those who 
were unbelievers in the past. There is the figure called 


synecdoche, ex parte totum, that is, not exactly the 
same, but those who are like them, and just as 
unbelieving as those. So one must see from this life into 
that life. 

69 Now this is the best understanding, as | think, of 
these words of St. Peter; but | do not want to fight too 
hard. But | cannot well believe that Christ went down to 
the souls and preached to them there. The Scripture is 
also against this, and says that each one, when he 
comes there, will receive as he has believed and lived. 
For this reason, since it is not certain what will happen 
to the dead, the saying cannot be interpreted in this way. 
But it is certain that Christ is present and preaches into 
the heart, where a preacher preaches the word of God 
into the ear; therefore we could draw it there without 
danger. But to whom a better understanding is revealed, 
let him follow it. Now this is the 


1080 Eri. 5i, 460-462. First edition. Sermon on 1 Pet. 3, 19-22. 


Summa of the understanding | have indicated: Christ 
went to heaven and preached to the spirits, that is, to the 
souls of men, among whom the souls of men have been 
unbelievers for ages. Now follow on: 


v.20. Once they waited for the divine longsuffering 
in the days of Noah, when they prepared the ark, in 
which few, that is, eight souls were preserved by the 
water. 


70 Now St. Peter wants to lead us into the Scriptures 
so that we can study them, and he gives a likeness of 
Noah's ark and interprets the same figure. For it is nice 
to make similes with such images, as St. Paul does when 
he speaks of the two sons of Abraha and two wives, Gal. 
4, 22, and Christ Joh. 3, 14 of the serpent that Moses had 
set up in the desert. Such parables can be well 
understood and are also amusing; that is why St. Peter 
introduces this one, so that faith can be summarized in a 
physical image. So he wants to say: As it happened when 
Noah prepared the ark, so it is here. Just as he was kept 
in the box that floated in the middle of the water, so you 
also must be saved in baptism. The water there drowned 
all living things, men and animals, so baptism also 
drowns everything that is carnal and natural, and makes 
spiritual men. But we ship in the box that signifies the 
Lord Christ, or the Christian church, or the gospel that 
Christ preaches, or the body of Christ, in which we hang 
by faith and are saved, like Noah in the ark. So you see 
how the image summarizes in one summa what there is, 
faith and cross, life and death. Wherever there are people 
who cling to Christ, there is certainly a Christian church, 
where everything that comes from Adam and everything 
that is evil is drowned. 


V. 21. Which therefore also makes you blessed in 
baptism, which is signified by these things; not that 
which is signified by these things. 


W. ix. 790-793. 1081 


The abhorrence of the flesh, but the covenant of a 
good conscience with God. 


(71) You will not be kept and saved by washing the 
filth from the flesh, that the body may be clean, as the 
Jews did; such cleanliness is no longer valid, but "the 
covenant of a good conscience with God," that is, that 
you feel in yourself a good, happy conscience that is in 
covenant with God and can say, "He has promised me 
this, and he will keep it, for he cannot lie. So if you hang 
on his word and cling to it, you must be kept. Now "the 
covenant" is faith, that we may be kept, not an outward 
work that you can do. 


Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 


For this reason, St. Peter adds that he declares the 
faith which is based on the fact that Christ died, 
descended into hell, and rose from the dead. If he had 
remained dead, we would not have been helped; but 
because he is risen, and sits at the right hand of God, 
and has these things proclaimed to us, that we believe 
in him, we have a covenant with God, and a certain 
promise, so that we are kept, like Noah in the ark. So St. 
Peter made the ark completely spiritual, since there is 
not flesh and blood inside, but a good conscience 
towards God, that is, faith. 


V. 22. Who is at the right hand of God, gone up to 
heaven, and subject to him are the angels and the 
mighty men and the powers. 


He says all this to explain and strengthen our faith. 
For Christ also must ascend into heaven, and become a 
Lord over all creatures, and where there is any power, 
that he should bring us thither, and make us lords. This 
is said for our comfort, that we know that all authority in 
heaven and earth, including death and the devil, must 
serve and help us, as all things must serve and be at the 
feet of the Lord Christ. This is now the third chapter. The 
fourth follows. 


1082 eri. si, 462-184. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. ix, 793-796. 


1083 





The fourth chapter. 


V.1-3. Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in 
the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mind. For he 
who suffers in the flesh ceases from sins, that he may 
henceforth live, what is yet in the flesh, not according 
to the lusts of men, but according to the will of God. 
For it is enough that we have spent the past time of 
life according to the will of the Gentiles, walking in 
lust, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, drunkenness and 
abominable idolatries. 


St. Peter still remains on one track. As he has hitherto 
admonished us in general that we should suffer if it is 
God's will, and has set Christ as an example for us, so 
he now confirms this further and brings it back again; 
thus he wants to say: Since Christ suffered in the flesh, 
who is our duke and head, and has set an example for 
us all, that he has redeemed us through his suffering, we 
should follow him and also equip ourselves and put on 
such armor. 

(2) For in the Scriptures the life of the Lord Christ, and 
especially his passion, is held out to us in two ways. 
Firstly, as a gift, as St. Peter has already done in the third 
chapter, and firstly, as a building and teaching of faith, 
that through the blood of Christ we are redeemed and 
our sins are taken away, and how he is given and 
bestowed upon us, which cannot be grasped in any other 
way than by faith. Of this he said, speaking, v. 18. "Christ 
hath once suffered for our sins." This is the main and the 
best part of the Gospel. Secondly, Christ is presented 
and given to us as an example and model to follow. For 
if we now have Christ by faith for a gift, we are to go on 
and also do as he does to us, and follow him in all life 
and suffering. This is how St. Peter presents it here. But 
here St. Peter does not speak primarily of the works of 
love, so that we may serve our neighbor and do good, 
which are actually called good works (for he has said 
enough about them above), but of such works. 





We are told that the works that concern our body and 
serve ourselves will make faith stronger, that sin in the 
flesh will be put to death, and that we will be able to 
serve our neighbor all the better as a result. For if | tame 
my body so that it does not become lustful, | can also 
leave my neighbor his wife or child in peace. So, if | curb 
hatred and envy, | will be all the more skilled to be kind 
and friendly to my neighbor. 

(3) Now we have often enough said, Though we be 
justified by faith, and have the Lord Christ for our own, 
yet must we also do good works, and serve our 
neighbor. For we are never completely pure because we 
live on earth, and each one still finds evil desire in his 
own body. Faith begins to kill sin and give heaven, but it 
has not yet become perfect and completely strong; as 
Christ says of the Samaritan [Luc. 10:33 ff], who was not 
yet healed, but was bound and accepted to be healed. 
So it is here also: When we believe, our sin is bound up, 
that is, the damage we brought from Adam, and begins 
to be healed; but this happens less in one, more in the 
other, the more each one mortifies himself and subdues 
the flesh, and the stronger he has faith. Therefore, if we 
have the two things, faith and love, let this be our doing 
henceforth, that we may fully bless sin until we die. 
Therefore Saint Peter says, "Arm yourselves with the 
same mind," that is, make a firm resolution, and 
strengthen your hearts with the mind you receive from 
Christ. For if we are Christians, we must say, "My Lord 
suffered and shed his blood for me, and died for my 
sake; should | be so lazy as not to suffer also? For 
because the LORD goeth up to the head in the battle, 
how much more shall the servants go up with joy? So let 
us gain courage, that we may pass through, and be 
harnessed in our minds, that we may pass through 
joyfully. 


1084 Eri. si, 464-466. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 4, 1-3. 


4 The word "flesh" in Scripture does not only mean 
the body externally, since flesh and blood, bone and skin 
are on, but everything that comes from Adam. When God 
speaks Gen. 6, 3: "My spirit will no longer quarrel with 
men, for they are flesh"; and Isa. 40, 5: "All flesh will see 
the salvation of God", that is, it will be revealed before all 
men. So we also confess in faith: | believe the 
resurrection of the flesh, that is, that men will rise again. 
So "flesh" means man through and through, as he lives 
here in this life. Now the works of the flesh are described 
in detail in Paul, Gal. 5, 19-21, not only the gross, carnal 
works, as unchastity, but also the highest and most 
delicious vices, as idolatry and heresy, which are not 
only in the flesh, but also in reason. Therefore it must be 
understood that man with reason and will, inwardly and 
outwardly, with body and soul, is called "flesh," therefore 
that he seeks with all his powers outwardly and inwardly 
only 1) what is carnal, and what is good for the flesh. 

5 So St. Peter also says here that Christ suffered "in 
the flesh". Now it is certain that his suffering extended 
further than into the flesh alone: for his soul suffered the 
greatest 2) distress, as the prophet Isaiah says Cap. 53, 
11. So also understand that which follows here: "He that 
suffereth in the flesh ceaseth from sinning." For this does 
not only apply to cutting off the head and tearing the 
body, but to everything that may hurt a person, to all the 
misery and distress he suffers. For there are many 
people who have healthy bodies, and yet inwardly feel 
much heartache and misery. If it is done for Christ's 
sake, it is useful and good. "For he that suffereth in the 
flesh (saith he) ceaseth to sin." The holy cross is good 
for this purpose, that sin may be subdued by it; so when 
it is granted to thee, the tickle, envy, hatred, and other 
evil things pass away; 


1) Thus the Jena edition and the second adaptation. Although the 
original edition has "“ficht" (that is, sees), and Bucer translated 
according to it, we consider it a printing error. , 

2) Weimar's: great The second editing has: greatest. Bucer: 
extremam. 





W. ix, 796-798. 1085 


Therefore God has laid upon us the holy cross, that it 
may drive us and compel us, that we should believe, and 
one should reach out to the other. Therefore it follows: 


V. 2: That he may live henceforth, which is yet in 
the flesh, not according to the lusts of men, but 
according to the will of God. 


(6) Henceforth, as long as we live, we are to take 
captive the flesh by the cross and by mortification, that 
we may do what pleases God, not that we should or 
could earn anything thereby. "Not to human lusts" (he 
says), that is, that we do not do what other people lust 
after us; for we are not to conform ourselves to this world, 
as Paul says Rom. 12, 2. What the world wants from us, 
that we must avoid. 


For it is enough that we have spent the past time 
of life according to the will of the Gentiles, walking in 
lust, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, drunkenness and 
abominable idolatries. 


(7) We have already done too much, that before faith 
we have spent our lives so shamefully "in pagan will", 
which is just as much as in human lusts. Therefore, as 
long as we continue to live, we should see to it that we 
do what pleases God. For we have our enemy in our 
flesh, that is, the real mischief, not only the coarse things, 
but especially the conceit of reason, which Paul calls 


prudentiam carnis, that is, "the prudence of the flesh" 
[Rom. 8:6]. When one has subdued this arrogance, the 
other can be tamed; it usually harms one's neighbor so 
secretly that one cannot notice it. 

8 "Horniness" is the name of St. Peter, which is done 
with outward gestures or words, so that one gives evil 
signs, if one already does not do the work, and is lewd in 
sight and hearing, from which the lust and also the work 
follows. Then follows also such idolatry, which is 
abominable. Therefore we may well bring this upon 
ourselves, for since we have lost faith, we have certainly 
also lost God, and if we look at it rightly, we are practicing 
more abominable idolatry than the heathen. 


1086 Eri. si, 466-468. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. ix, 798-801. 


V. 4. 5. And they are displeased that ye run not 
with them into the same mixture of disorderly things, 
and blaspheme you; who shall give account unto him 
that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 

(9) That is, ye have hitherto lived heathenishly; but 
because ye are now departed, it is strange unto men, 
and seemeth them to be shameful and foolish, saying, 
Yea, how great fools are these, that they turn away from 
all worldly goods and pleasures. But let them think it 
strange, let them also blaspheme you; they will have to 
give account, therefore command ye him that shall 
judge. 

For to this end the gospel has been preached even 
to those who are dead, that they may be judged 
according to the 1) flesh, but live in the Spirit of God. 
But the end of all things is near. 

(10) Now this is a strange and strange text. The 
words clearly state that the gospel is preached not only 
to the living, but also to the dead, and yet he adds that 
they will be judged according to the flesh. Now they have 
not flesh; therefore it cannot be understood as of the 
living. Itis a strange speech, which it is. Whether the text 
comes to us in its entirety, or whether something has 
fallen out, | do not know. But | understand it thus: One 
must not worry how God will condemn the Gentiles who 
died many hundred years ago, but who are alive now; 
therefore it is said of men on earth. 

(11) But you must understand the word "flesh" in the 
same way as | said above [§ 4], that the whole man is 
called flesh, as he lives; as he is also called whole spirit, 
when he strives for that which is spiritual. Now this is 
mixed together, as | speak of a man who is wounded, 
that he is whole and yet wounded, so that the healthy 
part is greater than the wounded part; but he is called 
wounded only according to the part in which he is 
wounded. So the spirit is also to proceed here. That is 
why he says that they are called "wounded" according to 
the outward part. 

1) In the editions of the New Testament up to 1534 and in the first 


edition of our Scripture "to man". But because all printings after that 
have "to man" in the interpretation, so we have put it here also. 





1087 


The first thing is to be condemned, but to be kept and 
live according to the inner being, that is, according to the 
spirit. 

(12) But how is it that he says that they are alive, and 
yet says that they are dead? | will interpret it thus 
according to my understanding, but | will not set a goal 
for the Holy Spirit to call the unbelievers "dead. For | 
cannot accept the idea that the gospel should be 
preached to the dead and deceased, unless St. Peter 
means that the gospel went out freely and sounded 
everywhere [Col. 1, 23.It was not preached secretly ina 
corner, but so publicly that all creatures, if they had ears, 
might have heard it, as Christ commanded in the last 
chapter, v. 15: "Go, preach the gospel to all creatures." 
So when it is preached, it finds people who are 
condemned according to the flesh, but live according to 
the spirit. 


V. 7. But the end of all things is at hand. 


(13) This is also a strange speech. It is now almost a 
thousand and five hundred years that St. Peter 
preached; that is not a near or short time: nor does he 
say that the end of all things is near at hand and is 
already here, as John also says in his epistle, 1 John 
2:18: "It is the last hour." If the apostle did not say this, 
one would say that it was a lie; but now one must firmly 
hold that the apostle is true. But what he means by it, he 
will himself strike out in the other epistle [Cap. 3, 8.). 
There he says why time is called near, and says: "One 
day in the sight of the Lord is like a thousand years, and 
a thousand years like one day," of which | said above 
[Cap. 3, § 68). So it must be reckoned that it will not be 
as long to the end of the world as it was from the 
beginning until that time, and we cannot wait to see two 
or three thousand years after the birth of Christ; the end 
will come before we know it. Therefore he says further: 


V. 8: Be sober and sober in prayer. But above all, 
have under one 


1088 Eri. si, 488-471. first edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 4, 8-10. 


Another is a fervent love, for love also covers the 
multitude of sins. 


(14) Then you see for what purpose we must be sober 
and chaste, that is, that we may be ready for prayer, for 
ourselves and for our neighbor. Even love cannot be 
ardent above these things, unless you subdue the body, 
so that love may have room with you. 

15 Here St. Peter took a saying from the Book of 
Proverbs, Cap. 10, 12: "Hatred causes strife, but love 
covers the multitude of sins. And this is St. Peter's 
opinion. Restrain your flesh and lust; if you do not do 
this, you will easily enrage one another, and will not 
easily be able to forgive one another. Therefore, think 
that you are curbing evil desire, so you can love one 
another and forgive; for love covers sin. 

(16) This saying has been interpreted to sound 
against faith; therefore they say: Thou sayest that faith 
alone maketh pious, and that no man by works may be 
loosed from sin: why then saith Solomon and Peter here, 
Love covereth sin? So answer: He that hateth another, 
saith Solomon, ceaseth not from striving after strife and 
contention: but where love is, it covereth sin, and 
forgiveth it gladly. Where there is anger, there 1) is an 
unconciled man, who will not be reconciled and remains 
full of anger and hatred; but a man who is full of love 
cannot be angered, no matter how much he is harmed; 
he covers up everything and acts as if he did not see it. 
So that the covering is said against the neighbor, not 
against God. No one shall cover your sin before God, 
except faith. But my neighbor's sin covers my love. And 
just as God covers my sin with His love when | believe, 
so | should also cover my neighbor's sin. Therefore he 
says: Love one another, that one may cover another's 
sin. And love does not cover one, two or three sins, but 
the multitude of sins, cannot suffer and do too much, 
covers everything. St. Paul also says this, and puts this 
saying from 1 Cor. 13:7 in the same way: 


1) "there" taken by us from Walch. In the other editions: "that". 


W. ix, soi-803. 1089 


Love endures everything and tolerates everything, 
believes everything and hopes everything, is at its best 
with everyone, and can suffer and take credit for 
everything that is put to it. Follow on: 


V. 9. 10. Be hospitable to one another without 
murmuring, and serve one another, each with the gift 
he has received. 


(17) "Hospitable" means one who gladly lodges. 
When the apostles were walking together in the 
countryside, preaching, and sending the disciples to and 
fro, one had to give lodging to the other. As it should still 
be, that one should preach from place to place, from 
town to town, from house to house, and not stay too long 
in one place, that one might see where someone was 
weak, that one might help him, where someone had 
fallen, that one might raise him up, and the like. This 
should now be done without murmuring, St. Peter wants, 
so that no one will let it be too much for him. 

(18) Now this also is a work of love, as it follows, that 
we should serve one another. With what? With the gifts 
of God that each has received. The Gospel wants each 
one to be a servant of the other, and to see to it that he 
remains in the gift he has received, which God has given 
him, that is, what his position is, to which he has been 
called. God does not want a master to serve a servant, 
a maid to be a wife, or a prince to serve a beggar, for He 
does not want to break the authorities. So he means that 
spiritually one should serve another with the heart; even 
though you are high and a great lord, you should still use 
your authority to serve your neighbor with it. So let each 
one consider himself a servant. Thus the master can 
remain a master, and yet not consider himself better 
than the servant, so that he would also gladly be a 
servant, if it were God's providence, and so on in other 
states. 

As the good stewards of God's many graces. 

God has not given us all the same grace, therefore 
each one should see what he is sent for, what gift is 


given to him. If he feels that he needs it for the service 
of his neighbor, as St. Peter further explains and says: 


1090 en. si, 471-473. interpretations on the ist epistle of St. Peter. w.ix, s03-8ve. 1091 


V. 11: If anyone speaks, he speaks it as the word 
of God. 


(20) If any man have grace to preach and to teach, 
let him teach and preach, as St. Paul saith Romans 
12:3-6: "That no man be wise too much, and think more 
of him than is fitting; but every man according as God 
hath divided unto him the measure of faith. For just as 
we have many members in one body, but all the 
members do not have the same business, so we are 
many in one body in Christ, but one is another's 
member. And have divers gifts according to the grace 
that is given unto us." And follows, v. 7: "If any man have 
a prophecy, let it be like unto faith. If any man have an 
office, let him wait for the office. If any man teach, let him 
wait for doctrine." So he also teaches elsewhere to 
Corinthians and Ephesians [1 Cor. 12, 12. Eph. 4, 7.]. 

(21) For this reason God has poured out various gifts 
among the people, which are to be directed solely so 
that one may serve another with them, especially those 
who are in government, whether with preaching or other 
ministry. Now here St. Peter says: "If anyone wishes to 
speak, let him speak it so that it may be the word of God. 
It is almost easy to remember that no one should preach 
anything unless he is sure that it is God's word. Then St. 
Peter shut the pope's mouth; and behold, he wants to 
be St. Peter's chair heir, how fine he holds it. Further: 


If anyone has an office to do it, than out of the 
wealth that God gives 


(22) This is: Whoever rules in the Christian church 
and has an office or a ministry to care for souls, he shall 
not go as he pleases and say: | am a sovereign, | must 
be obeyed, what | create, 1) that shall be created. God 
wants it so that one should do nothing else but what he 
gives, so that it is God's work and order. Therefore a 
bishop shall do nothing unless he is sure that God does 
it, that it is God's word or work. And that is why: for God 
does not want anyone to think that what he does with 
the Christian Church is a joke. Therefore, we must stand 
in such certainty that 


1) create - command. Cf. Col. 1035, s 67. 





God speaks and works in us, and our faith can therefore 
say, "That which | have spoken and done, God has done 
and spoken, so that | also die on it. Otherwise, when | 
am not sure of things, my faith stands on sand, and the 
devil takes me away. 

23 Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to accept any 
bishop's commandment unless he is certain that God 
does what he does, and can say, "| have God's word and 
commandment. Where this is not the case, he is to be 
considered a liar. For God has decreed that our 
conscience should stand on a rock. This is what is said 
of the common rule, that no one should follow his own 
conceit in it, and not do anything unless he is sure that 
God will have it. From this you can see how St. Peter 
has so long before pushed the Pope's and bishops' 
regiment to the ground, as it is doing now. Concludes: 


So that in all things you may travel to God 
through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power 
forever and ever, Amen. 


(24) Therefore you should be so sure that God 
speaks and does all that you speak and do. For if you do 
a work of which you are not certain that God has done 
it, you cannot praise Him and give Him thanks; but if you 
are certain of it, you can give Him thanks and praise Him 
because of His word and work; otherwise, you are 
suspicious of Him and consider Him to be an impostor. 
Therefore it is a shameful and harmful thing where one 
wants to rule in Christianity without God's word and 
work. That is why St. Peter made it necessary for him to 
instruct how the government of Christianity should be. 
Continue: 


V. 12. Beloved, do not let the heat among you be 
strange to you, as if something strange were 
happening to you. 


This is a way of speaking that is not common in our 
language. But St. Peter uses the same speech to remind 
us of what the Scriptures say. For this is how the 
Scriptures speak of suffering, that it is like an oven full of 
fire and heat. Thus, in the first chapter above, St. Peter 
says 


1092 Erl. 51, 473-478. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 4, 12-14. 


W. Ix, 806-809. 1093 





v. 7: "That your faith may be proved more precious than 
the gold that perisheth by fire." Thus one also reads in 
the prophet Isaiah; Cap. 48, 10. God says: "I have tried 
you in the furnace of poverty"; and Psalm 17, 3.: "With 
fire you have tried me"; item Psalm 26, 2.: "Lord, you 
wanted to burn through my kidneys and my heart"; item, 
Psalm 66, 12.: "We have passed through fire and water." 
So the scripture has it in the custom that it calls the 
suffering Durchfeurung or a temptation through the fire. 
St. Peter agrees with this here, that we should not allow 
ourselves to be alienated or to think ourselves strange 
and weird, as if the heat or blaze should not happen to 
us, through which we are tempted, as if gold were 
melted in the fire. 

When faith is challenged, God does not let it go, but 
sends us the holy cross on the nuck to strengthen us 
and make the faith strong in us. The holy gospel is a 
powerful word; therefore it cannot come to its work 
without challenge, and no one realizes that it has such 
power except those who taste it. Where there is 
suffering and the cross, it can prove and exercise its 
power. It is a word of life; therefore it must exercise all 
its power in dying. If there is not death and dying, it can 
do nothing, and no one can see that it does such virtue, 
and is stronger than sin and death. That is why he says, 
"that you may be tempted," that is, God does not put any 
fervency or heat (that is, the cross and suffering that 
makes you fervent) on you, because you are tempted, 
even though you cling to his word. So it is written in Wis 
10:12 of Jacob: "God gave him a hard struggle, that he 
might know that divine wisdom is stronger than all 
things." This is the reason why God lays out the cross to 
all believers, so that they may taste and try the power of 
God, which they have grasped through faith. 


V. 13. But be partakers of the sufferings of Christ. 


27 St. Peter does not say that we should feel the 
suffering of Christ, so that we can feel his suffering. 





He wants to say: Christ suffered, so you think that you 
also suffer and are tempted. So when you suffer, you 
have fellowship with the Lord Christ. For if we want to 
live with him, we must also die with him. If | want to sit 
with him in the kingdom, | must also suffer with him, as 
St. Paul often says: 


Be glad, that you may have joy and gladness at the 
time of the revelation of his glory. 


028 Though ye come into torment and burning, yet 
shall ye rejoice. For though it be bodily suffering, it shall 
be spiritual joy, that ye may rejoice for ever. For joy 
begins here in suffering and lasts forever. Otherwise, 
whoever does not bear the suffering joyfully, and 
becomes unhappy and wants to be angry with God, will 
have both, here and there, eternal torment and suffering. 
Thus one reads of holy martyrs that they went cheerfully 
to the torture, and thus acquired 1) that they rejoice 
eternally; as of St. Agatha, that she was so cheerful that 
she had to lie in prison, as if she should go to the dance. 
And the apostles went with joy and thanked God that 
they were worthy to suffer for the sake of Christ, Apost, 
5, 41. 


At the time of its revelation. 


29 Christ is not yet seen as a Lord, but is still at work 
with us. For himself he is, but we, who are his members, 
are not yet lords. But then we shall become lords, when 
his glory shall be revealed in the sight of all men at the 
last day, clearer than the sun. 


V. 14: Blessed are you when you are reviled by the 
name of Christ. 


(30) Christ is an ugly name in the sight of the world, 
and when one preaches of him, he must suffer the best 
of the earth to blasoheme and revile his name. But this 
is more dangerous and greater in our day, that they 
which persecute us, having also the name of Christ, say 
they are Christians and are baptized, yet deny and 
persecute Christ in deed. This is a wretched 
controversy. They lead the same

1094 Erl. 81, 475-478. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 809-811. 


Names just as strong as we are, against us. Therefore, 
even though the wisest and most pious people persecute 
us, we can take comfort in standing still and being 
cheerful. Why is that? 


For the Spirit, who is the Spirit of glory and of 
God, rests upon you. With them he is blasphemed, 
but with you he is praised. 


31. You (he says) have with you a spirit, that is, the 
Spirit of God and of glory, that is, such a spirit as makes 
us glorious. But this he does not do here on earth; but he 
will do it when the glory of Christ shall be revealed at the 
last day. Above this he is not only a Spirit who makes us 
glorious, but also whom we glorify. For the Holy Spirit is 
specially credited with transfiguring and glorifying, just as 
He transfigured and glorified Christ. 

32 Now this same Spirit (he says) rests on you, 
because the name of Christ rests on you; he is 
blasphemed by them, for he must suffer to be 
blasphemed and reviled exceedingly. Therefore, do not 
take up blasphemy; it appeals to the Spirit, who is the 
Spirit of glory; do not worry, he will avenge it and set you 
in honor. This is the comfort we Christians have, that we 
can say: The word is not mine, the faith is not mine, it is 
all God's works, he who reviles me reviles God; as Christ 
says Matt. 10:40, "He who receives you receives me"; 
and again, "He who reviles you reviles me." 

33 Therefore St. Peter wants to say: Know that the 
spirit you have is so strong that it will punish its enemy, 
just as God says in Exodus 23:22: "If you listen to my 
commandments, | will be an enemy to your enemies. 
And the Scriptures indicate many times that the enemies 
of the holy people are the enemies of God. Now if we are 
reviled because we are Christians and believe, we are 
not reviled, but the reviling is actually against God 
Himself. Therefore he says: "Be of good cheer, for this 
happens to the spirit that is not yours, but God's. Now he 
adds a warning: 


V. 15. 16. But let no one among you suffer as a 
murderer, or a thief, or a malefactor, or 


1095 


addicted to other people's good. But if he suffers as a 
Christian, he is not ashamed; but he praises God in 
the matter. 


034 So he says, Ye have heard how ye ought to 
suffer, and how ye ought to keep yourselves therein: but 
see that it be not because ye have deserved it of your 
iniquity, but for Christ's sake. But now it is not so with us, 
for we must suffer, regardless of the fact that those who 
persecute us also have the name of Christ; and no one 
can die because he is a Christian, but as an enemy of 
Christ, and those who persecute him say that they are 
righteous Christians, and also say that he who dies for 
Christ's sake is blessed. There only the spirit must 
separate; there you must know that you are a Christian 
before God. God's judgment is secret, for He has now 
turned it around and no longer wants to judge by the 
name, as at that time when the name went out from the 
first. 

Now St. Peter says: When you suffer in this way, you 
should not be ashamed, but should praise God. There he 
makes the suffering and torture dear, that it is so great 
that we should praise God because of it, because we 
suffer, so that we are not worthy of it. But now no one 
wants to go there. What is the use of putting the cross in 
monstrances? Christ's cross does not make me blessed. 
| must believe in his cross, but | must carry my own cross. 
| must take his suffering into my heart, and then | will 
have the right treasure. St. Peter's bones are holy, but 
what does it help you? You and your bones must become 
holy yourself, which also happens when you suffer for the 
sake of Christ. 


V. 17 For it is time for judgment to begin on the 
house of God. But first of all, what will be the end of 
those who do not believe in the gospel of God? 


Here he touches two prophetic sayings at once. First, 
the prophet Jeremiah says Cap. 25, 29: "Behold, | begin 
to punish in the capital city where my name is called, and 
| first punish my dearest children who believe in me. And 
you, who do not believe and are my enemies, think that 
you want to be punished. 


1096 Eri. si, 478-4M. First edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 4, 17-19. 


W. ix, 8n-8is. 1097 





escape?" And Cap. 49, 12. He says: "Those who are not 
to blame for drinking the cup, they must drink it; and you 
think that you should not drink it? | smite my beloved, 
that thou mayest see what | will do to the enemies. Then 
see what words these are: the greater the saints God 
has, the more shamefully he has caused them to perish, 
and what will become of the others? According to 
Ezekiel, Cap. 9, 6, he saw some men in armor with their 
weapons, who were supposed to kill everyone, to whom 
God said: "Lift up my sanctuary. This is what St. Peter 
means here. Therefore he says: The time is here, as the 
prophets said, that judgment must begin on us. When 
the Gospel is preached, God begins to punish sin, to kill 
and to make alive. He strikes the pious with the fox's tail, 
and is first of all the motherwort; but what will become of 
those who do not believe? As if he were to say, "If he 
treats his dear children with such seriousness, you can 
count what punishment will befall those who do not 
believe. 


V. 18. And if the righteous is hardly preserved, 
where will the wicked and the sinner appear? 

37 This saying is also taken from the Book of 
Proverbs, Cap. 11, 31: Si justus in terra recipit, "if the 


righteous must be pushed, where will the wicked 
remain?" This is also what St. Peter says here, the Ge 


right can hardly be preserved and goes exactly to. The 
righteous is the one who believes; it still takes effort and 
work in faith that he may pass through and become 
blessed, for he must pass through the embers; where 
then will he remain who does not believe? So if God 
gives faith a push so that it wriggles, how can he stay 
and stand who is without faith? Therefore, he resolves 
upon it: 


v. 19. Therefore, those who suffer according to 
God's will command [Him] 1) their souls, as the 
faithful Creator, with good works. 


(38) That is, those to whom God inflicts suffering, 
which they have not sought and chosen for themselves, 
should commit their souls to Him. They do well, remain 
in good works, do not turn away for the sake of suffering, 
and entrust themselves to their Creator, who is faithful. 
This is a great comfort to us. God created your soul 
without your care and without your doing, when you were 
still nothing; so he can well preserve it. Therefore trust it 
to him, but in such a way that it will be done with good 
works, not that you think, "Well, | will die free. You must 
see that you are a good Christian and prove your faith 
with works. But if thou goest so roughly thou shalt see 
how thou shalt fare. This is the last admonition that St. 
Peter gives to those who are to suffer for God's sake. 
Now follow: 

1) "ihm" is missing in the German editions, but Bucer offers: 


eontrustunt ei. Also in the interpretation here follows immediately: 
"They shall command their souls to him." 


The fifth chapter. 


I exhort the elders who are among you, the fellow 
elder and witness of the sufferings that are in Christ, 
and fellow member of the glory that is to be revealed. 
Feed the flock of Christ that is among you, and feed 
them, not by compulsion, but willingly, not by 
shameful desire of gain, but by inclination of mind, 
not as the rulers of the inheritance, but become the 
models of the flock, and ye shall receive (when the 
Arch Shepherd shall appear) the unfading crown. 


(1) St. Peter gives instruction on how those who are 
to preside over the people in spiritual government 
should conduct themselves. Now he said in the next 
chapter that no one should teach or preach anything 
unless he is sure that it is God's word; so that our 
conscience may stand on a solid rock. For this is bound 
up with us Christians, that we must be certain what is 
pleasing to God or not. Where this is not, there are no 
Christians. After this, he also said what each man's 
conscience is. 


1098 Er. 51, 480-488. 


or work, that he should consider it as if it were God's 
doing. But this saying actually applies to the bishops or 
pastors, how they are to be skillful and how they are to 
conduct themselves. 

But here you must get used to the language and learn 
what the words mean. The word presbyter or priest is a 
Greek word, in German it means an elder, as it is also 


called senatores in Latin, that is, a bunch of old, wise 
men, who are supposed to have much experience. So 
Christ also called his ministers and his council, who are 
to lead the spiritual regiment, that is, preach and care for 
a Christian congregation. Therefore, do not be misled if 
the priests are now called differently. For of those who 
are now called priests, the Scripture knows nothing; and 
put the nature out of sight, as it is now, and understand 
it thus, that St. Peter and other apostles, when they 
came into a city, where there were believing people or 
Christians, there they raised up an old man or two, who 
kept themselves honest, had wife and child, and were 
knowledgeable in the Scriptures, and they called them 


presbyteros. 
3. after that they are called Paul and Peter also 


episcopos, that is, bishops. Therefore it has been one 
thing, bishop and priest. 1) We have another fine 
example of this in the legend of St. Martin, that one 
came with some to a place in Africam, and saw that a 
man was lying there in a hut, whom they took for a 
farmer and did not know who he was. After that, when 
the people gathered there, he stood up and preached, 
and they saw that he was their pastor or bishop. For at 
the same time they did not wear peculiar clothes and 
gestures in front of other people. 

(4) These elders, says St. Peter, who are to care for 
and provide for the people, | exhort, of whom | am also 
one. Therefore you see clearly that those whom he calls 
elders have been in the ministry and have preached, 
therefore he also calls himself an elder. And here St. 
Peter humbles himself; he does not say that he is a ruler, 
although he would have had power, because he was an 
apostle of Christ; and he calls himself an apostle. 


1) Cf. Walch, St. Louiser Ausg. vol. X, 314, § 88. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. w. 1x, sis-si7. 





1099 


not only a fellow elder, but also a witness of the 
sufferings that are in Christ; as if to say, | do not preach 
alone, but | am also among the Christians who must 
suffer. So that he indicates where Christians are, that 
they have to suffer and are persecuted. This is a 
righteous apostle. If there were now such a pope or 
bishop who also had this title, we would gladly kiss their 
feet. 


And comrade in the glory that is to be revealed. 


5 This is even higher, and of course a bishop may not 
say it easily, because then St. Peter makes himself a 
saint. He was sure that he would be blessed, because 
he had many promises. When Christ said John 15:16: "I 
have chosen you." But it took much effort before the 
apostles got there. They had to come down first and 
become bad boys. Now, although he knows that he is a 
companion of blessedness, he is not proud, nor does he 
exalt himself, even though he is holy. Well then, what 
shall the elders do? Follow: 


V. 3. Feed the flock of Christ that is among you. 


6 Christ is the arch-shepherd, and has under him 
many shepherds, as well as many flocks of sheep, which 
he has sent out to his shepherds to and fro, as St. Peter 
writes here, in many lands. What shall these shepherds 
do? They are to feed the flock of Christ. The pope has 
taken this upon himself and wants to prove that he is 
sovereign and may deal with the sheep as he pleases. 
It is well known what "feed" means, namely, that the 
shepherds give the sheep pasture and fodder, so that 
they become fruitful; in addition, that they see to it that 
the wolves do not come and tear the sheep apart; it does 
not mean slaughtering and strangling. 

7 Now St. Peter actually says, the host of Christ; as 
[if] he should say: Do not think that the host is yours, you 
are only servants. Against this now our bishops speak 
defiantly: You are my sheep. We are Christ's sheep. For 
so he also said above [Cap. 2, 25.], "Ye are now 
converted unto the bishop and shepherd of your souls." 
The bishops are 


1100 Eu. sr, 482-484. First edition. Sermon on | Petr. 5, 2. 


W. IX, 817-820. 1101 





Servants of Christ, to shepherd His sheep and give them 
pasture. Therefore, "feeding" is nothing else but 
preaching the gospel, by which the souls are fed, 
become fat and fruitful, so that the sheep feed on the 
gospel and God's word, which is only the office of a 
bishop. So Christ also says to Petro [John 21:16], "Feed 
my sheep," that is, the sheep you are to feed are not 
yours but mine. Nevertheless, they have torn the words 
to the effect that the pope has external authority over all 
Christendom, and yet none of them preaches a word of 
the gospel. And | am concerned that since St. Peter's 
time there has been no pope who has preached the 
gospel. There is no one who has written anything and 
left it behind, because the Gospel is inside. St. Gregory, 
the Pope, has certainly been a holy man, but his 
sermons are not worth a penny, so that it seems that the 
See of Rome is especially cursed by God. Some popes 
may have been martyred for the sake of the Gospel, but 
there is nothing written about them that is the Gospel. 
Nevertheless they go and preach, they must feed; and 
yet they do nothing, but catch and corrupt the 
consciences with their own laws, and preach no word of 
Christ. 

8 It is true that among all Christians there are many, 
both male and female, who are able to preach, as well 
as those who preach there; but among the whole 
multitude there are always many who are not strong. 
Therefore it is necessary to raise up one to strengthen 
them, lest wolves come and tear the sheep. For a 
preacher must not only feed the sheep, so that he 
instructs them how to be true Christians, but must also 
ward off the wolves, so that they do not attack the sheep 
and lead them astray with false doctrine and introduce 
error; just as the devil does not rest. Now there are many 
people who may well suffer the gospel to be preached, 
if only one does not cry out against the wolves and 
preach against the prelates. But though | preach rightly, 
and feed and teach the sheep well, yet it is not enough 
to shepherd the sheep and keep them, lest the wolves 
come and lead them away again. For what is the 


When | throw out stones, 1) and watch another throw 
them in again? The wolf can well suffer that the sheep 
have good pasture; he has them the better that they are 
hostile; but he cannot suffer that the dogs bark hostilely. 
Therefore it is a great thing who takes it to heart that one 
feeds rightly, as God has commanded. 

(9) "The host (he says) that is among you," that is, 
that is with you; not that it should lie at their feet. "And 
give them away, not under compulsion, but willingly, not 
out of shameful desire for gain." There he even wrote 
with one word what the prophet Ezekiel writes about the 
shepherds or bishops Cap. 34, 2. ff. And this is the 
opinion: You should not only feed them, but also have 
respect for them and notice where they are lacking and 


in need. And here he uses a Greek word éxloKOnobvTtEC, 
that is, be bishops, and comes from the little word 


Exioxonoc, which means in German a Vorseher 2) or 
watchman, who lies on the guard or on the watch, and 
sees around him what everyone lacks. Notice now that 
a bishop and an elder are one thing. Therefore it is a lie 
that they now say that the office of bishop is called a 
dignity, and that he who wears a pointed hat on his head 
is a bishop. It is not called a dignity, but an office, that 
he should look and watch for us, and be our watchman, 
that he should know what infirmities are everywhere; 
where one is weak and has an evil conscience, that he 
should help and comfort; where one falls, that he should 
straighten him out, and the like; so that the Christian 
people may be sufficiently supplied in body and soul. 2c. 
That is why | have often said, 3) if there were a proper 
government now, there would have to be three or four 
bishops in a city, who would care for the church and 
have respect where there was a lack everywhere. 

10 And here St. Peter stirs two different pieces, 


1) The reading: "ausswerffe" is found in all editions of the first and 
the second adaptation. Instead, one would expect "aufwerfen," which 
Walch has placed in the text. In Latin, this passage reads: Nam quid 
aedificavero, si quos aedificio immisero lapides, videam alium, qui 
eos rursum ejiciat, neque prohibeam? 

2) Bucer: prospeetor. 

3) Cf. Walch, St. Louis ed. vol. X, 1365, ? 163; Ma. vol. XIX, 1094, 
W 55. 57. 


1102 en. 51, 484-486. exegesis on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


who might frighten someone into presiding over the 
people. First of all, there are some who are devout and 
do not like to be forced to be preachers, for it is a 
laborious office to see how the sheep live, to help them 
and to guide them; one must watch day and night, and 
defend oneself so that the wolves do not break in; one 
must also put life and limb on it. Therefore he says, "You 
shall not be forced to do it. It is true that no one should 
press into office without being called; but if he is called 
and required, he should go willingly and do what his office 


W. IX, 820- 822. 1103 


as they wish. For we have one Lord, who is Christ, who 
rules our souls. The bishops shall do nothing but feed. 
(14) Then St. Peter overthrew with one word and 
condemned all the rule which now the pope leads, and 
clearly concludes that they do not have the power to 
command one word, but that they alone should be 
servants and say: This is what your Lord Christ says, 
therefore you should do this. As Christ also says [Luc. 
22:25, 26.), "The worldly kings reign, and the mighty are 
called gracious lords; but ye are not so." Against this the 


requires. For those who are compelled to do it, and have} pope says: "You shall rule and have power. 


no desire or love for it, will not do it well. 

(11) Others are worse than these, who preside over 
the people, and seek their gain by feeding their bellies. 
These seek the wool and milk of the sheep, asking 
nothing of the pasture, as our bishops do now. Now this 
is almost a harmful thing and vice, for it is especially 
shameful for a bishop. That is why both apostles, Peter 
and Paul, often reported it [Acts 20:33], and also the 
prophets. Therefore also Moses says [4 Mos. 16, 15.]: 
"Thou knowest that | never desired any ox." Item, the 
prophet Samuel [1 Sam. 12, 3.): "You know that | have 
never taken an ass or ox from you." For if he who is to 
feed is so focused on the good and greedy for gain, he 
will soon become a wolf himself. 


But from an inclined mind. 


(12) This is that a bishop has a desire for it, and is 
inclined to it, and does it gladly. These are they that serve 
willingly, and seek not the wool of sheep. So we have two 
kinds of false shepherds: some who do not like to do it; 
others who like to do it, but for the sake of avarice. 
Further he says: 


V.3 Not as the rulers of the inheritance. 


(13) These are they who like to rule for the sake of 
honor, that they may be exalted and be mighty tyrants. 
Therefore he admonishes them, that they do not act as if 
the people were under them, that they may be and make 
rulers. 


V. 3. 4. But become examples to the host, and you 
will receive the unfading crown (when the Arch 
Shepherd appears). 


(15) That is, think that ye stand in the front, and lead 
such a course that your life may be an example to the 
people, and they may follow you. But thus our bishops 
say to the people, Go and do so; and they sit on cushions 
and are nobles, laying burdens on us which they 
themselves do not touch [Matt. 23:4], when they ought 
not to preach a word and call another, if they had not 
done it for themselves. 1) But if they were urged to do so, 
they would soon tire of their violence. 

For this, St. Peter does not want to give the bishops 
a temporal reward, as if to say: Your ministry is so great 
that it cannot be rewarded here, but you will receive an 
eternal crown, which will follow if you feed Christ's sheep 
in this way. This is the admonition that St. Peter gives to 
those who are to care for souls. From this you can 
strongly conclude and clearly prove that the pope with his 
bishops is an end-Christian or an anti-Christian, since he 
does not do any of the things that St. Peter demands 
here, and neither teaches nor does them himself, but 
rather does exactly the opposite, and not only does not 
want to feed the sheep or let them feed, but is himself a 
wolf and tears them apart, and yet boasts that he is the 
governor of the Lord Christ. Yes, indeed he is, 


1) Bucer: (UOd non antea ipsi praestitissent: thus 


he has translated "for" taken for ee and by below. 


1104 Eri. 51, 186-488. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 5, 3-6. 


W. ix, 822-825. 1105 





when Christ is not there, just as the devil also sits and 
reigns in Christ's stead. 

(17) Therefore it is necessary that the simple 
understand this and such sayings, and hold the pope's 
rule against them when they are asked and examined, 
so that they may answer and say, Thus Christ said and 
did; but the pope teaches and does contrary. Christ says 
yes, the pope says no. Because they are against each 
other, one of them must be lying. Now Christ does not 
lie; therefore | conclude that the pope is a liar, and in 
addition the right end-Christian. So you must be 
equipped with the Scriptures, so that you can not only 
call the pope an end-Christian, but know how to prove it 
clearly, so that you can surely die on it and stand against 
the devil in death. Now follow on: 


You are like them, you younger ones, subject to 
the elders. 


18 These are the last admonitions in this epistle. St. 
Peter wants to have such an order in Christianity, that 
the young should follow the old, so that everything goes 
hand in hand with the humility of the unrulers towards 
the superiors. If this were to happen now, there would 
not be much need for laws. He wants to have it straight 
so that the younger ones are to be governed according 
to the understanding of the old ones, as they know best, 
that it is done to the praise of God. But he thinks, St. 
Peter, that such old people should be learned and 
understanding in the Holy Spirit. For where they 
themselves are fools and understand nothing, no good 
government comes of it; but if they are understanding, 
then it is good that they govern the youth. But St. Peter 
does not speak here of the secular government, but in 
general that the elders should govern the younger ones 
in the spirit, be they priests or other old men. 


V. 5. All of you be subject to one another, and 
demonstrate humility in this. 


019 Then he hath directed himself, and tempered his 
word, and wills that every one should be subject to 
another. How can this rhyme, if the elders are to rule, 
and yet all are subject to one another? Should it be 
reversed? He who will, let him give 


such a gloss that St. Peter spoke above of old people; 
here he speaks of young people. But we want to let the 
words remain, so that they are said in general, as Paul 
also says Rom. 12, 10: "Let one precede the other with 
reverence. The young should be subject to the old, but 
in such a way that those, the superiors, do not consider 
themselves masters, but also let them down and follow, 
where a young man would be more understanding and 
learned; as God also in the Old Testament often raised 
up young men, who were more understanding than the 
old. So Christ also teaches Luc. 14, 8-10: "When you are 
invited, do not sit at the top, lest a more honest man than 
you be invited, and when he who invited you and him 
comes, say to you, ‘Turn away from this man, and you 
will have to sit at the bottom with shame. But when thou 
art charged, sit thou down at the bottom, that when he 
that charged thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, 
move up." And to this he introduces the saying, as in 
many other places, v. 11. "He that exalteth himself shall 
be abased, and he that abaseth himself shall be 
exalted." 

020 For this cause the young shall be subject unto 
the elders; but yet again the elders shall be so skillful, 
that every one may think himself the least in heart. If this 
were done, we should have good peace and prosperity 
on earth. This is what we are to do," he says, "so that we 
may show humility in this. 


For God resists the proud, but gives grace to the 
lowly. 


21 That is, those who will not yield, God casts down; 
and again, He exalts those who humble themselves. 
This is a mean saying; God would have him be mean in 
life. 


V. 6. Therefore, lower yourselves under the 
mighty hand of God. 


22. Because God wills it so, that one shall submit to 
another, do it willingly and gladly; and he will exalt you. 
But if you will not do it willingly, you will have to do it; he 
will throw you down. 


1106 Enl. si, 488-491, Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. W. ix, 825-828. 


1107 





That he may exalt you in his time. 


(23) It seems as if God is pushing His own down, as 
if He wants to be outside too long. Therefore he says: 
Do not be deceived by it, and put it out of your sight; and 
rely on the fact that you have a certain assurance that it 
is God's hand and His will. Therefore do not consider the 
time, how long you are in bondage. For though he is 
consumed, yet will he exalt you. Therefore, hereafter 
follow: 


V. 7 Cast all your care upon him, for he cares for 
you. 


(24) You have this assurance, so that you may be 
sure that God will not leave you, but will take care of you. 
Therefore let all your cares go, and let him do it. These 
are exceedingly sweet words; how could he make it 
sweeter and kinder? But why does he need so much 
irritation? Because no one likes to let himself be brought 
down and let his mind go. Therefore he gives such 
comfort that God not only looks after us, but also cares 
for us and takes care of us. Further he says: 


V. 8 Be sober and watchful, for your adversary the 
devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom 
he may devour. 


(25) Then he gives us a warning, and will open our 
eyes; and it would be worth while that the saying should 
be written with letters of gold. There you see what this 
life is, and how it is painted, that we should always wish 
that we were dead. We are here in the devil's kingdom, 
no different than if a pilgrim came to an inn, knowing that 
they were all robbers in the house; if he had to come 
there, he would still prepare himself and provide as best 
he could, and not sleep much. So we are now on earth, 
where the evil spirit is a prince, and has the hearts of 
men in his power, doing through them what he wills. It is 
frightening, if you look at it right. That is why St. Peter 
wants to warn us to be careful, and acts as a faithful 
servant who knows what is going on here. Therefore he 
says, "Be sober." For they eat, 


They are full of drunkenness and swine, and can do no 
good; therefore we must always have such a treasure 
with us. "And watch" (he says), not only spiritually, but 
also bodily. For a foul body, which loveth to sleep, when 
it eateth and drinketh to the full, shall not withstand the 
devil; because it is sore also to them that have faith and 
a spirit. 

26 Why then should we be sober and watchful? "For 
your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, 
seeking whom he may devour." The evil spirit does not 
sleep, is mischievous and wicked. He has set it before 
him to attack us, and knows the right handles on it; he 
goes about like a lion that is hungry and roars, wanting 
to devour everything. Here St. Peter gives us a delicious 
admonition, and tells us our enemy that we should 
beware of him. As Paul also says in 2 Cor. 2:11: "We 
know well the thoughts of the evil spirit." But the going 
around is such that he makes us careless; then follows 
anger, strife, pride, unchastity, contempt for God 2c. 

27 And here mark well that he saith, The devil 
walketh about. He does not go under your eyes when 
you are armed, but looks behind and in front, inside and 
outside, where he might attack you. If he attacks you 
here and now, he will soon go there and attack you in 
another place, breaking from one side to the other and 
using all kinds of cunning and trickery to trap you; and if 
you are already well armed in one place, he will invade 
another. If he cannot overthrow you there, he attacks you 
elsewhere, and so never stops, but goes around and 
around, leaving no rest anywhere. So we are fools and 
do not pay attention, do not walk and do not watch, so 
he can tear down well. Now therefore let every man take 
heed, and he shall feel something in himself: he that hath 
tried it knoweth it well. That is why we are poor people, 
because we are so careless. If we looked at it rightly, we 
should cry murder over life. Thus Job said Cap. 7, 1: 
"Man's life on earth is nothing but a camp, but vain strife 
and contention." Why then does God make us live and 
fight on earth? 


1108 Enl. 5i, 4gi-4->3. First edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 5, 8-12. 


W. ix, 8W-WO. 1109 





How can we leave it? That faith may be exercised and 
increase, and that we may hasten out of this life, and 
taste of death, and gain a desire to die. 


V. 9: Resist firmly in faith. 


(28) Be sober and watchful, but that the body may be 
sent. But this does not defeat the devil; it is only so that 
you may give the body the less cause to sin. The right 
sword is that you are strong and firm in faith. If you take 
hold of God's word in your heart and keep it with faith, 
the devil cannot win, but must flee. So if you can say, 
"This is what my God has said, then | will get up; then 
you will see that he will soon go away; for then all 
displeasure, evil desire, anger, avarice, melancholy and 
doubt will go away. But the devil is cunning and does not 
like to let you do this, and he reaches out to take the 
sword out of your hand; if he makes you lazy, so that the 
body becomes clumsy and inclined to evil, he will soon 
snatch the sword out of your hand. He did the same to 
Heva; she had God's word, and if she had kept it, she 
would not have fallen. But when the devil saw that she 
held the word so loosely, he tore it out of her heart, so 
that she let it go; and so he had won. [2 Cor. 11:3, Gen. 
3:4, 13.] 

29 Thus St. Peter has sufficiently instructed us how 
to contend with the devil. It costs not much running to 
and fro, nor any work that thou canst do, but no more 
than that thou cleave to the word by faith. When he 
comes, and wants to drive you into a melancholy 
because of sin, then only take hold of the word of God, 
which promises forgiveness of sins, and consider it, and 
he must soon depart. St. Peter continues: 


And know that you are undergoing the same 
suffering that you have in the world together with 
your brotherhood. 


30 That is, do not be surprised if you have to be 
tempted by the devil, but take comfort in the fact that you 
are not alone, but that there are more of you who also 
have to bear such suffering, and think that your fellow 
brothers will help you fight. 





This is now the epistle, in which you have heard 
enough of a righteous Christian teaching, how 
masterfully he has described faith, love and the holy 
cross, and how he instructs and warns us how we should 
fight with the devil. Whoever now grasps the epistle, has 
no doubt enough that he does not need more, without 
God abundantly teaching just that in other books as well. 
But it is nothing else; for here the apostle has forgotten 
nothing that is necessary for a Christian to know. In the 
end he does as a good preacher should do, that he not 
only thinks to feed the sheep, but also cares for them 
and pleads for them; and concludes with a prayer that 
God will give them grace and strength to grasp and keep 
the word. 


V. 10. But the God of all grace, who has called you 
to His eternal glory in Christ, the same will prepare, 
strengthen, fortify and establish you who suffer a 
little while. 


32. this is the desire, that he may command them to 
God. God, who alone gives grace, and not a piece of 
grace, but abundantly all grace in one heap, who called 
you through Christ, that you should have eternal glory, 
not of your own merit, but through Christ: if you have 
Him, then by faith, without your merit, you have eternal 
glory and blessedness; who will prepare you to be 
strong, to grow and to stand, and to be able to do many 
things; and will strengthen and establish you, that you 
may bear and suffer all things. 


V. 11: To Him be glory and power forever and 
ever, amen. 

Praise is the sacrifice that we Christians should offer 
to God. Now he adds something to the resolution: 

V. 12. Through your faithful brother Sylvanum 
(as I eighth) I have written you a little to exhort, and 
to testify that this is the right grace of God in which 
you stand. 

(34) Although | know (he says) that you also heard it 
before, and already know that you must not let me teach 


you, yet | have written this to you, that | may also teach 
you (as the right apostles should do). 


1110 Eni. 51, 493 f. 52, 1 f. Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. W. IL, 830-833. 


1111 





exhort you to continue in it, so that you may practice it 
and not think that | am preaching anything else than what 
you have heard before. 


V. 13. Greetings to you who are gathered in 
Babylonia. 


35 So they used to write on the letters: Good night. 
"Greetings" (he says), namely the congregation of 
Babylonia. | respect, but still do not know for true, that 
he means Rome here; because one thinks that he wrote 
the epistle from Rome. Otherwise there are two 
Babylonia: one in Chaldea, the other in Egypto, where 
Alkair is now. But Rome is not called Babylonia, because 
spiritually, on the opinion, as he said above Cap. 4, 4. 
said, "the mixture of the disorderly being". For Babel in 
Hebrew means a mixture. So he may have called Rome 
a mixture, because there was such a disorderly being 
and mixture, of all kinds of shameful life and vice, and 
what was in all the world for shame, all flowed there. In 
the same (he says) a congregation is gathered, they are 
Christians, they let you say their greeting. | 





But here | want to give freedom to everyone to do as he 
pleases, because there is no power in it. 


And my son Marcus. 


36. it is said here that he means Marcum the 
evangelist, and does not call him his son fleshly, but 
spiritually, as Paul calls Timotheum and Titum his sons 
[1 Tim. 1, 2. Tit. 1, 4.], and says to the Corinthians [1 Ep. 
4, 15.] that he gave birth to them in Christ. 


V. 14. Greet one another with the kiss of love. 

This custom has now ceased. In the Gospel it is 
clearly read that Christ received his disciples with the 
kiss; and such has been a way in the countries. St. Paul 
also often speaks of the kiss [2 Cor. 13, 12]. 


Peace be with all who are in Christ JEsu. 

That is, those who believe in Christ. This is the 
parting, that he may command them to God. So we have 
the first epistle. God grant us grace to grasp and keep it, 
amen.

Second editing. 


Preached (1538? and) 1539; printed 1539. 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. 

This is the signature of this epistle, in which St. Peter 
exalts and praises his office, says he is an apostle or 
legate, not of a king or emperor on earth, but of Jesus 
Christ, who is one Lord over all, Apost. 10. 


But he does not use such a glorious title for his own 
sake, but first of all because he wants to show by it that 
he has not penetrated to this high office out of his own 
choice or presumption, nor out of human counsel, but 
was ordained to it. 








*) This second arrangement is found only in the Wittenberg edition (1556), Vol. |, p. 4836, and in the Erlangen edition, Vol. 52, p. 1. In 
order to avoid unnecessary repetitions, we have also discussed this second arrangement in the first note to the previous number. See also 


the preface to this volume.

and called, without means, by Christ the Lord himself; 
secondly, that one should be sure that his (as well as 
other apostles') preaching or teaching is God's word, 
and whoever hears him and believes his testimony 
hears him whose messenger or legate he is, and shall 
be saved; but whoever despises him despises him who 
sent him 2c., Matth. 10. 

So now he briefly indicates with these words, "Peter, 
an apostle of Jesus Christ", that he is commanded to an 
office, that he should proclaim to all the world 
forgiveness of sins, redemption from death, 
righteousness, life and salvation, not by Mosaic law, 
much less by man's commandment, work, own 
righteousness, merit 2c., but only through Jesus Christ, 
who was ordained from eternity and proclaimed by all 
the prophets, that he should crush the head of the 
serpent and redeem all generations on earth from the 
curse; thus he soon condemns in the signature all kinds 
of teachings that lead away from this Savior and indicate 
another way to become righteous and blessed before 
God; he also secretly states that all those who teach 
such things are not Christ's, but Satan's apostles, be 
they who they will. 


To the chosen strangers back and forth in Ponto, 
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. 


This is the heading in which it is indicated to whom 
St. Peter wrote this epistle, namely, to the Gentiles who 
lived in these countries, which he names here, who were 


1113 


It should be noted that the apostles were sent 
primarily to the Gentiles, as the prophets were sent to the 
Jews. This is proven by the fact that they wrote all their 
epistles to the Gentiles, except those to the Hebrews and 
St. Jacob. Yes, you say, St. Paul says in Gal. 2 that the 
gospel to the Gentiles was entrusted to him, but to the 
Jews to Petro. This does not prevent it, because St. Peter 
also preached among the Gentiles, Apost. 10, and wrote 
to them, as this heading and the whole epistle show; 
therefore he is 1) an apostle to the Gentiles as well as to 
the Jews 2c.: just as St. Paul also calls himself an apostle 
to the Gentiles, and yet he also preached to the Jews; 
indeed, where he found Jews now and then among the 
Gentiles, he first visited them and preached Christ to 
them. But where they would not hear him, nor accept his 
testimony, he turned to the Gentiles, as is seen in the 
Acts of the Apostles; wherefore Christ also calls him his 
chosen instrument, who should preach his name, not 
only among the Gentiles, but also among the children of 
Israel, Apost. 9. 

Therefore St. Paul speaks Gal. 2. about how it was at 
the same time when St. Peter preached in Judea and he 
among the Gentiles. For St. Paul had a calling and 
command to soon travel among the Gentiles and preach 
the gospel to them (and yet, as | said, he also preached 
to the Jews from time to time). Peter and the others had 
a command to go first to the lost sheep of the house of 
Israel, to whom Christ was promised. Since they had 
visited them and the small group that St. Paul used to call 


converted to the Christian faith through the preaching of |the remnant, and had converted them to the faith, and 
the Gospel. Otherwise, he would not have written to|the large group remained obdurate and persecuted the

1114 en.52,4-s. Interpretations of the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


What was it against their epistles being written and 
coming, not only to and for one people in one little corner 
of the world, as the Jews were, but to all the Gentiles in 
the whole wide world, by which they preach to the 
believers from them, from the same time and place until 
the end of the world? The evangelists also serve us 
Gentiles with their Scriptures, for they teach and testify 
that Christ, the Savior of all the world, appeared and 
accomplished what was proclaimed of him in the 
Scriptures, namely, that he redeemed the human race 
2c.; item, that the Jews were to be rejected and the 
Gentiles accepted in their place as God's people, as was 
done 2c. 

They are "strangers" who are called foreigners. But 
he calls them strangers because they were Gentiles. But 
because they were now converted to the faith, he does 
not call them bad strangers, but chosen strangers; as if 
he should say: You, who were Gentiles and strangers 
before, who did not know God and had no hope, are no 
longer so, but are now citizens with the saints and 
members of God's household 2c., Eph. 2, or, as he 
speaks here, "chosen strangers", partakers of all 
heavenly goods in Christ; as he will explain this later with 
rich, glorious words. 


V. 2. According to the providence of God the 
Father. 


So | will say: That you have been chosen, you have 
not attained by your strength, work or merit, for the 
treasure is too great, that all men's holiness and 
righteousness are far too small to attain it; for this you 
were Gentiles, knowing nothing of God, having no hope, 
and serving dumb idols; Therefore, without any effort on 
your part, by pure grace, you come to such unspeakable 
glory, namely, because God the Father has provided 
you with it from eternity; so make God's provision quite 
sweet and comforting, as if He were to say: You are 
chosen, and remain so, for God, who has provided you, 
is strong and certain enough that He cannot lack His 
provision, however far you believe His promise and 
consider Him to be a faithful God. 





1115 


From this we are to take this lesson in brief, that the 
provision is not based on our worthiness and merit, as 
the sophists pretend, since the devil could make it 
uncertain and overthrow it at any moment; but it stands 
in God's hand, and is based on his mercy, which is 
unchanging and eternal; hence it is also called God's 
provision, and for this reason it is certain and cannot fail. 
Therefore, if your sin and unworthiness challenge you, 
and it occurs to you that you are not provided for by God, 
item, the number of the elect is small, the multitude of 
the wicked is great, and you are shocked by the horrific 
examples of divine wrath and judgment, 2c. then do not 
dispute long why God does this or that in this way, and 
not otherwise, if he could well do so, 2c. Nor do you dare 
to explore the abyss of divine providence with your 
reason, otherwise you will certainly be misled by it, 
either despair, or even strike yourself in the open, but 
stick to the promise of the Gospel, which will teach you 
that Christ, the Son of God, has come into the world to 
bless all nations on earth, that is, to redeem from sin and 
death, to justify and to save, and that he did this by the 
command and gracious will of God, the heavenly Father, 
"who so loved the world that he gave his one and only 
Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but 
have eternal life," Jn. 3. If you follow the advice, namely, 
recognize first that you are a child of nature's wrath, 
guilty of eternal death and damnation, from which no 
creature, either human or angelic, can save you, and 
then take hold of God's promise, believing that He is a 
merciful, truthful God, who faithfully keeps (out of pure 
grace, without any action on our part or merit) what he 
has said, and therefore sent Christ, his only Son, to 
make amends for your sin, and to give you his 
innocence and righteousness, and finally also to redeem 
you from all kinds of misery and death: Doubt not that 
thou art among the company of the elect 2c. If one acts 
in this way (as St. Paul also does), it is exceedingly 
comforting. If you do it differently, it is terrible 2c.

1117 





Through the sanctification of the Spirit. 


God the Father, he says, has provided for you to be 
His chosen children and to be sanctified, not by outward, 
fleshly holiness of the law, which with all its holiness no 
one has ever been able to make perfect in conscience, 
Hebr. 7, 19. 9, 13. 14. Phil. 3, 9. but much less by your 
pagan ways and idolatrous worship 2c. By what then? 
By the sanctification of the Spirit, for your hearts are 
sanctified and cleansed by faith from the filth of idolatry 
and superstition. To what end? 


To the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of 
JEsu Christ. 


You were chosen by God and now sanctified, he 
says, not to persist and remain in your sins, your former 
pagan and vain ways, but to continue to be obedient and 
believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which proclaims to 
you that you are sprinkled, not with calf's or goat's blood, 
Genesis 24:6, 8. 24, 6. 8. Hebr. 9, 19. or with sprinkling 
water of the ashes of the red heifer, 4 Mos. 19, 9.(Heb. 
9:13), as the Jewish people were sprinkled according to 
the law of Moses, by which alone they were sanctified 
for outward and bodily purity, but with a far, far better 
and more delicious sprinkling water, namely with the 
precious blood of Jesus Christ, the innocent and 
unblemished Lamb of God, by which you are inwardly 
sanctified in spirit and conscience and cleansed from all 
sin, so that you are now true servants of God, both pure 
in soul and holy in body. 2c. 

But this sprinkling happens when the gospel is 
preached of Christ, that he is the true paschal lamb, who 
sacrificed himself for the sin of the whole world, gave 
and shed his body and blood for us all 2c. He who is 
obedient to the preaching and believes is sprinkled by 
the right high priest, so that the strangler can do him no 
harm or harm. The 51st Psalm, v. 9, also says of the 
sprinkling: "Sprinkle me, O Lord, with hyssop, that | may 
be clean; wash me, that | may be white as snow. 


1) Erlanger: and. 





If thou shalt command me, it shall never make my heart 
clean and white as snow, that | may be loosed from sin, 
have a good and joyful conscience before thee, be 
justified, and be saved. Lord, you yourself must be a 
washer and bather here, and wash and sprinkle with a 
different water and blood than the Levitical high priests 
use; otherwise | will remain black, leprous and unclean 
forever, even though | sprinkle and wash myself every 
hour. 

Here you see that not only St. Peter the apostle, but 
also the holy prophet David, enlightened by the Holy 
Spirit, long before and just at the time when the law was 
in its highest momentum and was most glorious, 
indicates that the law with its beautiful, glorious worship 
and ceremonies, of which there were many, such as 
slaughtering, sacrifices, smoking, washing, sprinkling, 
etc., could not make the sinner's heart and soul pure, 
could not have purified the sinner's heart and soul, but 
all this was only a model and figure of the right sacrifice 
and sprinkling of blood, which Christ, the right high 
priest, had to perform himself. 


May God give you much grace and peace. 


This is the greeting. You are now, he says, obedient 
to Christ (by whose blood you were sprinkled and 
thereby made clean from your sins), and believe in him: 
for this reason you are righteous and holy, and in the 
grace of God, the heavenly Father, and because you 
know and believe this, you have a happy, peaceful 
conscience. But the devil and the world will do you all 
kinds of harm for the sake of such knowledge and faith, 
the former with fright and the latter with persecution. 
Therefore | wish with all my heart that God, the merciful 
Father, may give you much grace and peace, so that, 
even though the devil strikes you hard with his fiery 
arrows and dares to overthrow your faith (for he does 
not sleep, but goes about like a roaring lion), and the 
world persecutes, blasohemes and condemns you as 
heretics, so that you do not allow yourselves to be 
challenged in this way, but always console yourselves 
against this horrible sight and sorrow, that God in 
heaven is merciful to you for Christ's sake, in whom you 
are

have a certain 1) and lasting peace. If you want it, let the 
devil and the world be terrified, angry, persecuted 2c. 

Now he sows the epistle with fine, excellent words, 
speaks of the highest, greatest thing, as an apostle is 
wont to speak, and says: 


V. 3. Praise be to God, the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has 
given us a new birth into a living hope through the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. 


The devil has led the human race into the terrible 
damage and misery through the fall of Ade, so that all 
people are conceived and born in sins and therefore 
have to be subject to the devil's power. Therefore the 
bodily birth of father and mother cannot bring or give 
them more than this temporal and transitory life, which 
is not only full of toil and labor, but also quite short and 
uncertain, in which we are not safe from death for a 
moment; and even if it chokes us, there is still no end to 
the misery, yes, the real plague and torture then begins. 
For since we are all children of the wrath of nature and 
enemies of God, we are guilty of eternal death and 
damnation in addition to our temporal death. In this 
terrible and unspeakable misfortune are all Adam's 
children, no one excluded. 

Here the question is: What do we do to get rid of such 
misery, to get along again, to become pious and 
blessed? Here everyone wants to be a master and to 
know best how to discuss the matter. If you ask a Jew, 
he will give you this answer: if he is circumcised and 
keeps the law, he will be pious and blessed; a monk: if 
he keeps his order according to his rule 2c.; a Turk: if he 
does what is written in the Alkoran. In sum, every man 
(if he is otherwise of sound mind) has these thoughts by 
nature: that by his own powers, free will, good works and 
merit, or even above all by the Law of Moses, he will and 
can not only atone for his sins and appease God's wrath, 
but also that he will be saved. 


1) Erlanger: a conscience. 





also acquire God's grace, and attain eternal bliss, and 
thus heal and banish this murderous damage. Human 
reason cannot come any higher than this, therefore it 
cannot think, speak and teach about it in any other way 
than as said, as we have unfortunately experienced in 
the papacy. 

But the holy scripture speaks much differently about 
the matter, namely that we can never, neither by our 
doing nor by our not doing, get rid of sin, escape from 
death, attain righteousness and salvation, that is, come 
to the first innocence and righteousness, which Adam 
lost by the fall, and all of us in him, unless we all become 
new men, born again and differently, not of father and 
mother, but of water and the Spirit, John 3:5, Titus 3:5. 

This is also what St. Peter teaches here, when he 
says: You were chosen according to the providence of 
God the Father, sanctified and sprinkled with the blood 
of our Lord Jesus Christ 2c. You have come to this, not 
by your doing or not, but out of pure love and grace God 
and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has chosen you, 
who were without faith and hope in Him, according to His 
great mercy, not because of your works or merits, much 
less because of your sin, born again to a living hope, in 
which you will certainly have the eternal, heavenly 
inheritance to wait for, which neither moth nor rust can 
devour, nor a thief steal from you, for it will be preserved 
for you in heaven 2c. Now to him who has done the 
deed, let him also have glory and honor, and be praised 
and blessed forever. Amen. 

But how, or by what means, did such a rebirth take 
place? "By the resurrection," he says, "of Jesus Christ 
from the dead"; as if to say: God the Father has born us 
again, not of corruptible seed (as he will interpret himself 
afterwards), but of incorruptible seed, that is, of the word 
of truth, which is the power of God that gives new birth, 
makes alive and saves all who believe in it, Rom. 1:16. 
What then is this word? The very word that is preached 
among you, concerning Jesus Christ, that he died for 
your sins and for the sins of the world, and rose again 
the third day, that he might be saved through the power 
of God. 


1120 Eni. 5s, ii-i3. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 3. 


would be enough for all the sins of the world through his 
death, and would bring righteousness, life and salvation 
through his resurrection. Whoever believes such a 
sermon, namely that Christ died and rose again for his 
good, the resurrection of Christ has proven its power in 
him, is thereby born again, that is, created anew in God's 
image, receives the Holy Spirit, recognizes God's 
gracious will, has heart, mind, courage, will and thoughts 
that no other saint of works or hypocrite has, namely that 
he will not be justified and saved by the work of the law, 
much less by his own righteousness, but by Christ's 
suffering and resurrection. 

That is called right apostolic preaching. For a true 
apostle's office is to preach neither the righteousness of 
men nor the holiness of the law, but the unspeakable 
grace and mercy of God, who did not spare His only Son, 
but gave Him up for us all to die an ignominious death 
on the cross for our sins, and to rise again for our 
righteousness’ sake; as the apostles diligently and 
mightily practiced such teaching. Look at their epistles, 
especially St. Paul. Paul, and read their sermons in the 
Acts of the Apostles by all means, and you will find that 
all their speeches and words are to the effect that Christ, 
the Lord, was denied and killed by his own people, to 
whom he was promised, even though he proved himself 
mightily with deeds, miracles and signs as the true Lord 
and Messiah: That God raised him from the dead and 
made him a Lord and a Christian, so that all who believe 
in him may receive forgiveness of sins through his name, 
which they could not receive through the works of the 
law, Acts 13:38. 13:38; that there is salvation in no other, 
neither is there any other name given to men, whereby 
we may be saved 2c.; item, that through him all things 
which we lost in Adam are made right again, in a better 
way than we had them in paradise 2c.; item, that through 
him all things which we lost in Adam are made right 
again, in a better way than we had them in paradise 2c.; 
item, that through him all things which we lost in Adam 
are made right again.In sum, that through him all who 
believe in him become not only pious and blessed, but 
also God's children and heirs, and his [Christ's] brothers 
and fellow heirs, raised up together with him and seated 
in the heavenly realm 2c. Eph. 2, 6. 





1121 


This is the blessed, comforting sermon that Christ 
commanded the apostles to preach to all the world, for 
the consolation of wretched and anxious consciences; 
for the gospel, he himself says in Matt. 11:5, is preached 
to the poor, that is, to those who feel their sin, who are 
terrified of death, who are sincerely afraid of God's wrath 
and judgment, and who groan for help and consolation. 
These cannot hear anything more sweet or comforting 
than that Jesus Christ, the innocent and unblemished 
Lamb of God, has taken upon Himself our sin, death and 
all misfortune, which here afflicts and oppresses us for a 
time, and there should have tormented and martyred us 
eternally, letting the law condemn Him as an evildoer and 
strangle death. But because he was_ eternal 
righteousness and life itself, sin and death could not keep 
him in their power. Therefore he rose again on the third 
day as an almighty Lord and God, who has the power to 
give up his life and to take it back again, John 10:18, and 
overcame all these enemies and took them captive, not 
for his own person, because he would not have had the 
right to do so anywhere, but for the sake of us wretched, 
damned sinners who believe in him, so that they can 
neither harm nor condemn us for eternity, even though 
they frighten and torment us at times because we are still 
alive here. 


To a living hope. 


That we live on earth is because, after we have 
believed, we are to proclaim, as he will say later [1 Pet 
2:9], the virtues of him who called us from darkness to 
his marvelous light, so that others may also come to such 
knowledge and faith through us as we have also received 
from others; otherwise it would be best that God should 
leave us to die as soon as we have been baptized and 
have begun to believe. But because we are on earth, we 
must live in hope. For although we are certain that 
through faith we have all the goods of God (for faith 
certainly brings with it the new birth, filiation, and 
inheritance), we do not yet possess them sensibly, but 
await them through hope, which St. Peter, according to 
Hebrew 


1122 en. 52, 13-15. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


way calls a hope of life. We speak according to our 
language: a living hope, that is, in which we may 
certainly hope and be sure of eternal life. But the 
treasure is still hidden and covered so that it cannot be 
seen; it can now only be grasped with the heart and 
through faith. Therefore, we must take comfort in the 
hope that is sure and will not leave us in shame until that 
day when we will see what we now hope for. 

Through this sermon of St. Peter's, first of all, all glory 
of human powers, free will, good works, of one's own, 
even of the Law of Moses' righteousness 2c. is violently 
beaten to the ground. For can we prepare ourselves for 
grace and attain eternal life by our own works and merits, 
as the Pope and his sophists and canonists have 
unashamedly taught and written, and still want to 
maintain as true: what is it necessary that God, out of 
pure grace, should have mercy on us, let His only 
begotten Son become man, die on the cross for our sins, 
and proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His 
name among all nations? So | hear that we are not 
allowed to do anything good? Yes, we have been born 
again in Christ Jesus for this very reason, that we should 
not only do good, and now more than ever can do it, but 
also suffer evil for all our good deeds; of which more 
hereafter. 

On the other hand, St. Peter here further indicates 
that it is only through Christ, as the one mediator 
between God and men, that we come to grace and are 
reconciled to God the Father; for he speaks in clear 
words that God has reborn us through the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ 2c. Therefore, what has been taught so 
far in Christianity about calling upon the saints as if they 
were our mediators and intercessors, who could 
intercede and represent us before God and make us 
worthy of their merit, is false and fictitious, for no reason 
is found for it in Scripture; for this the honor due to Christ 
alone would be given to the saints, which is not to be 
suffered in any way. 

St. Paul teaches the same now and then in his 
epistles. Rom. 5, 1. he says: "Now 


1123 


we have been justified by faith, so we have peace with 
God," not through ourselves, but "through our Lord 
Jesus Christ. Therefore, we must bring Christ with us, 
come with Him, pay God with Him, and do everything 
through Him and in His name that we want to do with 
God. So St. Peter wants to say here: "We are certainly 
waiting for eternal life, even though we are still here on 
earth; but through nothing else than that Christ has risen 
from the dead, has ascended to heaven, and is sitting at 
the right hand of God. For for this cause he ascended, 
that he might give us his Spirit, that we might be born 
again, and now through him 1) stand before the Father, 
and say: | come and pray before thee, heavenly Father, 
not that | should rely on my prayer, but in the name of 
JEsu Christ my HEART, who rose again from death, and 
now sitteth at thy right hand, representing me 2c., | come 
and pray 2c. 

Now whoever is not satisfied by this comforting 
teaching of the Gospel, gains a happy conscience and 
strong confidence in God the Father through Christ, will 
certainly attain it through the laws of Moses, much less 
through the commandments of men; for if he cannot take 
comfort in the fact that Christ came for the sake of 
sinners, died for them, and shed his blood for them 2c.A 
thousand times less will he be able to take comfort in his 
own order, his own righteousness 2c., for what is the 
holiness of all angels and the suffering and merit of all 
saints compared to the precious blood of the Lamb of 
God 2c.? Therefore it hardly serves the saints of works 
right that they let their hearts be sore all their lives, do 
many great, hard works, and yet get nothing out of it, 
because here time and again all toil and labor, and never 
a happy conscience, and there eternal damnation and 
hellish torture. If they believed the gospel and let Christ 
remain the Savior of the world, they would not be 
allowed to do so. But the world is not to be advised; it is 
and remains the devil's own, therefore it hates the light 
and remains in darkness 2c, Joh. 3, 20.

V. 4. to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled 
and unfading. 


In other words, God has reborn us through the 
resurrection of Christ, not so that we should be rich, 
powerful and great lords here on earth (which the bodily 
birth brings with it, if God wills it), but He has reborn us 
to a heavenly inheritance, against which all the world's 
riches, honor and power are nothing. For what the world 
has, be it ever so precious, solid, beautiful and lovely, is 
nevertheless transient and so uncertain that one is not 
sure of it for a moment; moreover, it is unclean, for 
people abuse it to their own destruction and damnation; 
about which one soon becomes full and weary. But our 
inheritance, which is brought to us by regeneration, is 
first of all imperishable and eternal: therefore we must 
not worry that it will be damaged or that it will cease to 
exist; secondly, it is undefiled, that is, it is fine and 
beautiful, which can never stain us or make us unclean, 
as temporal goods are wont to do 2c.Thirdly, it is 
imperishable, that is, it does not wither or decay, nor 
does it perish like all temporal goods, but remains fresh 
and green forever; therefore we shall never be weary or 
tired of it. We do not yet possess such an inheritance, 
but hope for its certainty. 

These are excellent, comforting words, which should 
make us happy from the bottom of our hearts. But 
because this our inheritance and treasure, of which St. 
Peter speaks here, is still hidden, and cannot be 
comprehended with any sense; for there are not more 
miserable and worthless people on earth, for the very 
ones who expect this inheritance through hope must feel 
the devil's terror in their hearts, and suffer that the world 
is bitter to them, hates, persecutes and condemns them 
as the worst of boys, who do all evil. 2c: [so] it can be 
seen and felt as if they were not only abandoned by all 
the world, but also by God Himself, therefore it does not 
seem at all that they should be God's children, who have 
a better and more glorious inheritance to wait for in 
heaven, than is the wealth and glory of all kings on earth, 
yes, the world considers them 1) to be lukewarm. 


1) Wittenberger: "helts" - holds them. 





They are beggars and fools. This ghastly and horrible 
sight also hinders their faith and joy, and makes them 
often feel the contradiction, and think as if God was 
angry with them, and wanted to push them into the 
abyss of hell and condemn them. 

But all this out of sight, and holding firmly to the words 
of St. Peter, where he says: God the Father has reborn 
us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ to an 
imperishable, undefiled and unfading inheritance, which 
we do not yet have and possess visibly, but are waiting 
for in certain hope in his time. Whether the devil does 
not grant us such honor 2) and therefore makes this life 
sour for us, and the world hounds us, [there] is nothing 
to it 3), it will not last forever. We are here for a short 
time in his inn, where he receives us badly and keeps 
us, SO we may take it for good, be patient and hold fast: 
this small loss will be well and abundantly repaid to us. 
This little poverty, little contempt and short sorrow, which 
he inflicts on us here, will be followed by an eternal, 
heavenly riches, glory and unspeakable joy and bliss, 
against which all suffering and hardship, which 
oppresses us here, 4) is nothing at all. If the children of 
the world can endure great hardship and suffering, 
hoping to gain something temporal, why should we not 
do so much more, who have such a glorious and divine 
promise of this heavenly and eternal inheritance? 


This is what you will keep in heaven. 


Your heavenly inheritance, he says, you are quite 
sure of, even though you do not see it with your eyes, 
nor do you possess it at present, for it is kept for you and 
kept in a place where it is safe and remains, namely in 
heaven, where no one can rob or steal it; and if it is still 
to be done for a short time, you will not only see it, but 
also receive it for your own and possess it eternally with 
glorious and inexpressible joy. When will this happen? 
At the last time, namely when

Christ will appear in His glory and raise us from the dead. 
It seems to us that it will be a long time yet, but in the 
sight of God a thousand years are like a day, yes, like a 
night watch; also, if we are resurrected on that day and 
have lain under the earth for a thousand years or even 
more, it will seem to us like a short time that we have 
been sleeping in the grave. In addition, our life will pass 
away as quickly as if it flew away, Ps. 90:10, and death 
will come upon our necks before we know it. 


V. 5: Who by the power of God are kept through 
faith unto salvation, which is prepared to be revealed 
in the last time. 


To say: It was impossible for you to endure the devil's 
fierce anger, poison and cunning, and to bear the world's 
bitter enmity, blasphemy and persecution; But you have 
a strong supporter and helper, who is called God and the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who (for as he began 
the good work in you, so he must also accomplish it, 
otherwise it is lost) preserves you by his divine almighty 
power and might, that you may remain steadfast in the 
faith of his word, and in the living hope, through patience, 
await the blessedness prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world, but still hidden and covered up, 
certainly shut up and sealed, so that it may remain 
unharmed and undestroyed; But in his time it will be 
opened and uncovered in a moment, so that you will 
have to look at it forever and rejoice in it 2c. 

The papists scoff at us, because we practice the 
doctrine of faith so diligently and make it so high and 
difficult, as it is not easily grasped and retained; they say, 
we can do nothing but teach about faith, Christians know 
beforehand how and what they should believe, Turks 
and pagans are to be preached the faith 2c. There are 
also many among us who, when they hear that faith 
alone, without all works, makes them righteous, they 
have such a delusion: "Behold, what you hear and read 
from and in the Scriptures, you believe to be right and 
true, therefore you have faith; thus they think that the 
delusion and dream they make for themselves in their 
hearts is faith. 


1) In the original: "one". 


But St. Peter teaches here that faith is not a thought 
or a bad delusion, which a man himself invents, but 
God's power must be there and work in us, so that we 
believe, and through faith are preserved and kept to 
salvation. In this way, St. Paul also speaks of faith in Eph. 
1, 17-20: "The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father 
of glory, grant you," he says, "the spirit of wisdom and 
revelation" 2c., "that ye may know what is the exceeding 
greatness of his power toward us who believe (not of our 
own strength or free will, but) according to the working of 
his mighty strength, which he wrought in Christ, when he 
raised him from the dead"; as if to say: That we believe 
in Christ, and through him have a hearty confidence in 
God, as in our dear Father, is through his exceeding 
great power and mighty strength, by which he raised 
Christ from the dead; by the same he creates and works 
such faith in us 2c.From this it can be seen that the 
apostles do not consider faith to be a low, bad art, which 
can be attained by human strength, and which can be 
learned as quickly and easily as the works saints think 
2c. In his epistles, St. Paul always prays for the Christian 
communities to whom he writes that God would 
strengthen and preserve them in the faith, and desires 
that they increase in the knowledge and faith of Christ, 
that they may have complete hope 2c. He also confesses 
for himself that he reckons everything for harm against 
the exuberant knowledge of Christ JEsu, and yet speaks 
soon after that, he has not yet grasped it, is also not yet 
perfect, but he strives for it and chases after the intended 
goal and jewel 2c. St. Peter also does the same, wishing 
the faithful that God may give and increase His grace 
and peace abundantly; item, that they may grow in the 
grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ, and asking that 
God of all grace, who has called them to His eternal glory 
in Christ Jesus, may prepare, strengthen, fortify and 
establish them. 

Therefore, when the wretched papists pretend that 
every Christian knows well how or what he should 
believe, 2c. they sufficiently indicate that 


1128 En. 52, so-22. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 5. 6. 


1129 








They have neither understanding nor experience of 
what faith is. Also the sure and false Christians, of whom 
there are always more than of the righteous, have no 
right report of faith, for they think that if they fall into sin 
and persevere in it, and only believe, then there is no 
danger, for faith alone makes righteous without all 
works; they rely on this, do nothing good, even vile evil, 
and still want to be Christians, but are much worse than 
heathens 2c. But we have heard above that faith gives 
birth to man again and makes him new in heart, courage 
and mind, who then bears good fruit as a good tree and 
leads a holy life 2c.; if not, then it is not a true faith. 

In sum, the doctrine of faith is unknown to the world, 
therefore it cannot judge it differently, because it is either 
a bad, easy art, or error and heresy, and those who 
confess and accept it, call them seducers and enemies 
of the church. But St. Peter teaches here that faith is 
such a precious and noble treasure, to which nothing 
can be compared, for it gives a right and clear 
understanding to judge rightly and surely of all things. 
For he who has been told and told from the Scriptures, 
and has understood by faith that Christ is the only Savior 
of the world, without whom and apart from whom no one 
can be saved from sin and death, nor attain salvation, 
can soon judge which doctrine is divine and wholesome, 
which is seductive and devilish, which faith is righteous 
and which is false, which works are good and which are 
hypocritical, which state is holy and spiritual, and which 
is unholy and condemnable, and does not lack; For 
God's word, by which he is guided, does not let him err. 
Again, where there is no such knowledge and faith, 
there can be nothing else but blindness and error; 
therefore one can also not rightly divide from any thing, 
is called black white, darkness light 2c., and again, white 
black, Isa. 5, 20. Hence it is that man now undertakes 
this, now another work, to atone for sin and to gain God's 
favor, hence so many foundations, monasteries and so 
many false services have come about; but all is lost, for 
Christ alone is the way, the truth and the life; to whom 
he does not shine, he is the light of the world. 





by his word, he must err, accept lies for truth, die in sins 
and perish. 


V. 6 In which you will rejoice, who now for a little 
while (where it is to be) are grieved in many 
temptations. 


Here the apostle shows how Christians fare in the 
world. In the sight of God in heaven, they are the dear 
children of the eternal, heavenly inheritance and certain 
of blessedness, as said before; but on earth, they are 
not only sad, afflicted and abandoned, but also have to 
suffer various temptations from the devil and the wicked 
world. How are they to blame? This is their greatest sin, 
that they believe in Christ, and praise and glorify God's 
unspeakable good deed, shown through him to all the 
world, namely, that he alone can save from sin and 
death, make just and blessed; that human reason by its 
free will, powers, good works 2c. that human reason, by 
its free will, powers, and good works, may not prepare 
itself for grace, much less earn eternal life, but with all 
its thoughts and deeds, be it called and glisten as it 
pleases, does not reconcile God, but rather angers him, 
because it does all this without, even against, his word 
and command, and despises what he has promised and 
commanded, and chooses something special out of its 
own devotion. Then the fire comes on, for the world will 
not and cannot suffer its good opinion, devotion, 
holiness, and good works 2c. to be punished and 
condemned, as if they should not count for anything in 
the sight of God, 1) then goes to, persecutes, and 
strangles those who say such things, as the worst 
blasphemers and rebels, and thinks that they are doing 
God a service by it. Therefore faith is not a drowsy 
thought in the heart, but he who has it speaks and 
confesses as he feels it in his heart; because of this he 
comes to misfortune, as the prophet laments in the 
116th Psalm, v. 10: "I believe, therefore | speak. But | 
am greatly afflicted." Therefore, St. Peter says: "You 
who are now Sad for a little while"; so put faith, hope and 
the holy cross together, because one follows from the 
other. 

But he does not leave it at that, he does not only say 
how they will be sad and have to suffer many trials, but 
he comforts them. 


1) Erlanger: should. 


1130 en. 52, 22-25. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


and says that it will only last a short time here on earth, 
and that such sadness and affliction will certainly be 
followed by eternal bliss, in which they will rejoice 
forever. That is to say, as the apostles are wont to 
comfort, they do not speak of temporal peace, rest, and 
favor of the world, but of the contradiction, namely, that 
Christians should freely consider that they will have no 
better than all the saints who have ever been, and the 
Lord, and the head of all the saints himself, has had. 
What shall they 1) have? Affliction, strife, sadness, 
anguish, distress 2c.; so that the Christians' comfort is 
not in visible, present things, which, though delicious 
and glorious, are transitory and uncertain, but in invisible 
and future, yet certain and eternal goods. 

It should also be noted that the apostle does not add 
in vain: "Where it should be"; as he also does in the 3rd 
chapter, v. 17, where he says: "It is better (if it is God's 
will) that you suffer for your own good" 2c. For there are 
many people who put on their own crosses without any 
need, as is the way of the saints of works, walking, as 
St. Paul says, according to their own choice, in the 
humility and spirituality of the angels, having an 
appearance of great wisdom and holiness through self- 
chosen spirituality and humility, and by not sparing the 
body, and not giving honor to the flesh for its need, Col. 
2, 23. The papacy has given many such people. But it 
shall not be, for it is not God's will that you choose for 
yourself a suffering or a cross out of your own devotion 
or conceit; but if you do, you are the devil's martyr, not 
Christ's, and it will be more sour for you to earn hell than 
heaven for one who suffers for God's sake. But where it 
should be, that is, if God so sends you that you must 
suffer for the sake of your confession of faith, accept it, 
and take comfort in the fact that St. Peter here says that 
sorrow should last a little while, but blessedness, in 
which you should rejoice, should be eternal. 

V. 7 That your faith may be found righteous and 
much more precious than that which perishes.

gold (which is tried by fire), to praise, glory and 
honor, when Jesus Christ is revealed. 


Here he shows with clear words the fruit and benefit 
of such temptations, which meet the believers both from 
the 2) tyrants and mobs, saying: They serve to prove the 
faith, to make it righteous and much more precious than 
the perishable gold, which is tried by fire. For as fire does 
no harm to gold, neither does it consume it, nor diminish 
it, but only benefits it, for it takes away all additions, so 
that it becomes quite pure and clean: so also the fire or 
heat of persecution and all kinds of temptation hurts and 
hurts the old man to such an extent, that those who are 
exercised by it become sad and sometimes impatient, 
but the faith becomes pure and clean through it, as gold 
or silver is refined. 

For the Christian life is meant to increase, to become 
holier and purer. First, we come to faith through the 
preaching of the Gospel; and through faith we become 
righteous and holy before God. But because we still live 
in the flesh, which is not without sin, the same are always 
stirring up, pulling us back, and preventing us from being 
as fully holy and pure as we ought to be; Therefore God 
throws us into the midst of the fire of temptations, 
sufferings and tribulations, by which we are swept and 
tried to our end, so that not only sin is killed in us the 
longer the more, but also faith is proven and increases, 
so that we become more certain of our cause from day 
to day, increase in the understanding of divine wisdom 
and knowledge, so that the Scriptures become clearer 
and clearer to us, to admonish our own the more 
powerfully by wholesome teaching, and to punish those 
who contradict. If the devil had not attacked us so 
violently with violence and cunning these years ago, we 
would never have reached this certainty in doctrine; nor 
would the article of Christian righteousness and the 
doctrine of faith have become so clear. Therefore, St. 
Paul says, 1 Cor. 11, 19: "There must be 


2) "den" is missing in the Erlanger. 


1132 En. [s, [s-27. . Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 7-9. 


1133 





There shall be multitudes among you, that they which 
are righteous may be manifest among you"; and Christ, 
Matth. 18, 7: "There must be trouble" 2c. 

Nor can we be happy and laugh when we see that 
the enemies of divine truth are doing everything 
according to their will and desire, that they have all kinds 
of pleasure and joy here, are rich, great and mighty, and 
there is no measure nor end to their defiance and 
insistence, while we, on the other hand, are poor, 
miserable and despised. But St. Peter says: If it happens 
like this, it is good for us, because our faith must be 
found right through various trials, and we must be 
strengthened and comforted against such trouble, so 
that we are not angry with the wicked, but have 
compassion on them and think: What does it help them, 
if they are still so rich and happy, and have all the honor 
and power of the world? How long will they keep it? They 
are not sure of it for a moment, and before they know it, 
they will suffer eternally with the rich man, they will not 
be able to drink a drop of water, and for their short joy 
they will suffer eternally. 

Again, even if we suffer anguish and tribulation here 
for a little while, we still have peace in Christ, because 
we have the right treasure, which is better and more 
precious than all the glory and good of the world, namely 
his dear precious word, which preaches to us about 
eternal, heavenly goods, which, as St. Peter says, are 
preserved for us in heaven. Therefore we may suffer a 
little while with all the elect, and bear Christ's cross, and 
be reproached with him, and await with patience his 
blessed and consoling revelation and appearing, when 
he shall appear glorious with his saints, and marvelous 
with all the faithful; then shall our praise, glory, and 
honor begin and endure forever. Of this we take comfort 
and boast not only in the hope of the future glory that 
God will give, but also in the tribulations, knowing that 
tribulation brings patience 2c. Rom. 5, 3. 

V. 8. whom you have not seen, yet love, and now 
believe in him, though you do not see him. 





Here he praises them and gives them a great 
testimony that they love Christ and believe in him, even 
though they have never seen him, but only heard about 
him; and that is the truth of it. For whoever sincerely 
believes that through Christ's death and resurrection he 
has been justified from sin and redeemed from death will 
certainly love him. But if he loves him, the Father loves 
him again, Joh. 16, 27. But it does not have to be a false, 
colored love, as the hypocrites have, who serve Christ in 
a different way than he taught and commanded, namely 
according to their good opinion and devotion, and 
pretend that they do it in honor of Christ out of great love 
that they have for him; but he does not desire such love 
and honor, even considers it the greatest dishonor and 
dishonor. Therefore he adds, "You believe in him," 
indicating what the proper honor is, so that one may 
know that he loves him, namely, to believe his word. 
Therefore everything is lost that is done in honor of Christ 
except faith in him. 

And with these words, St. Peter recently indicates 
that Christian righteousness is to believe in Him and not 
to see Him, as He Himself says, John 16:10: "The Holy 
Spirit will punish the world for righteousness’ sake, so 
that | will go to the Father and you will not see me away"; 
further, that Christ is the true God, for believing and 
trusting belongs to God alone; now we believe in Christ, 
so that He can comfort us, help us and save us from all 
troubles, make us righteous and blessed 2c.item, even 
though we do not see him, we know and believe that he 
is with us and in us, Matth. 28, 20, and works everything 
in us 2c.; lastly, what kind of faith it is by which we are 
justified and saved before God, namely faith in Christ, 
that he is our Savior and mediator; thus all superstitions, 
of which there are countless, are excluded. 


V. 8. 9. So shall ye rejoice with joy unspeakable 
and glorious, and shall bring forth the end of your 
faith, even the blessedness of souls. 

St. Peter speaks here so clearly of the future joy in 
that life that | almost do not know whether elsewhere in 


Scripture it is spoken of in such bright, clear words, and 
yet | cannot say it. Whether, he speaks, 


1134 en. 52, 27-19. Interpretations of the | Epistle of St. Peter. 


1135 





If your honor, joy and happiness are delayed for a while, 
and you are still living here on earth in shame, sadness 
and tribulation because of the envy and malice of the 
devil and the world, do not worry; be patient, it will soon 
change. Now when you have fallen asleep and are 
buried in Christ, it is about an hour (as will be your mind 
in that day), then your joy will begin; it will be so great 
and glorious, he says, that no heart can sufficiently 
consider it, much less any mouth can utter it. Therefore, 
to reckon against it, all the joy that has ever been on 
earth and still will be, is to reckon a mere child's play. 
For there is no worldly joy so great and glorious that is 
not impure and mixed with sorrow, or that is not soon 
followed by sorrow; therefore Solomon says, Proverbs 
14:13: "After laughter comes weeping, after joy comes 
sorrow." Therefore it 1) cannot endure; for it is not only 
hindered without interruption with all kinds of misery and 
plague, but bodily death also finally comes and finishes 
it, and where there is no faith in Christ, the short, 
miserable, beggarly joy is followed by eternal death and 
damnation. 

But here it is the other way around: sorrow and 
suffering turn into joy, which is not only glorious and 
unspeakable, but in which we will also live forever and 
be blessed. Therefore remain steadfast in love and faith 
in Christ, whom you do not yet see, and suffer for his 
name's sake, as the devil and the evil world pour into 
you, and you will be richly and gloriously rewarded, for 
the end of your faith will be eternal blessedness 2c. This 
cannot be said in words, but must be believed from the 
heart; otherwise, no matter how much it is said, it will 
remain a useless wash. 

V. 10. For what blessedness the prophets sought 
and searched 2c. 

The blessedness | speak of, which you will receive, is 
certain, for it has a witness in the holy prophets. 

Here St. Peter directs us back to the Holy Scriptures, 
to see how God, for no merit's sake, but out of mere 
grace 

1) cans - it can. 





that he has promised. For all Scripture is designed to 
save us from our works and to bring us to faith. Therefore 
it is necessary that we study the Scriptures, so that we 
may be assured of faith. St. Paul also leads us into the 
Scriptures when he says Rom. 1:2: "God promised the 
gospel beforehand through his prophets in the holy 
Scriptures"; and Rom. 3:21: "The righteousness that 
comes through faith in Jesus Christ and is valid before 
God is revealed and testified through the Law and the 
Prophets. 

So we also read Apost. 17, 2. ff., when 2) St. Paul 
preached the faith in Christ to the Jews in Thessalonica 
and later in Berea, he spoke to them from the Scriptures, 
opened them and presented them that Christ had to 
suffer 2c. And when they heard these things, they 
searched the scriptures daily, whether it was so, as they 
were taught of St. Paul. Therefore we should also search 
the Scriptures, for it is they that testify of Christ (as he 
himself says Joh. 5, 39; item, v. 46).If you believed 
Mosiah, you would also believe me, for he wrote about 
me"), and thus learn to base the New Testament on the 
Old, and do not give credence to the idle chatterers who 
despise the Old Testament and say that it is no longer 
necessary; for we must take the foundation of our faith 
from it alone, for God sent the prophets to the Jews for 
this purpose, that they should bear witness to the future 
Christ. Therefore, the apostles everywhere convicted 
and overcame the Jews from their own Scriptures that 
this Jesus, whom they proclaimed to them, was Christ. 

So the books of Moses and the prophets are also 
gospel, because they preached and described the same 
things of Christ, which the apostles preached and wrote 
afterwards. But there is a difference between them. For 
though both are written on paper in the letter, yet the 
gospel or new testament is not really to be written, but 
put into a living voice, that it may resound and be heard 
in all the world; but that it is also written, 


2) "there" put by us instead of: that. 


1136 Eri. 5s, 2g-3i. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 10. 


1137 





was done out of abundance. But the Old Testament was 
written only in the Scriptures; therefore it is called a 
letter, and the apostles call it the Scriptures; for it alone 
pointed to the Christ who was to come. But the gospel is 
a living preaching of Christ who is coming. 

There is also a difference among the books of the Old 
Testament. First, the five books of Moses are the main 
part of the Scriptures and are actually called the Old 
Testament; after them are also histories and books of 
history, in which are described all kinds of examples of 
those who kept or did not keep the Law of Moses; third, 
the prophets, who are based on Moses, and what he has 
written, further and with clearer words, have elaborated 
and transfigured. But it is One opinion of all prophets and 
Mosis. 

But that they say that the Old Testament is abolished, 
you must understand this: First, the difference between 
the New and Old Testaments is, as we have now said, 
that the Old pointed to Christ, but the New now gives us 
that which was promised before in the Old, and was 
signified by the figures; wherefore the figures are now 
abolished, because that for which they served is now 
finished and accomplished, and fulfilled, which was 
promised in them. Therefore in the new testament there 
shall be no more distinction of meat, raiment, place, 
time, 2c. for in Christ there is nothing but a new creature. 
Also the Jews, who had to keep the difference of food, 
place and time according to their law, were not saved by 
it, nor were they therefore commanded to keep it, so that 
they would become godly before God, but that under 
such discipline and burden of the law they groaned for 
Christ, who would put an end to all this. 

Furthermore, it is to be noted that in the Old 
Testament God led two kinds of regiment, by which he 
subjected himself to rule the people himself, both 
inwardly in the heart and outwardly in the body and in 
the goods; therefore he also gave them so many 
different laws, mixed together. The laws that teach how 
to govern children, servants, and the home; how to plant, 
build, borrow, redeem, marry, and fight; how a man may 
give his wife a divorce; and how a man may give his wife 
a divorce. 





and let them go 2c. To the spiritual government belong 
those who teach about outward worship, but especially 
those who teach about faith and love, namely, that one 
should fear, believe and love God with all his heart 2c. 
and his neighbor as himself. But now in the New 
Testament he reigns in us spiritually through Christ; but 
the bodily and outward government he executes through 
the temporal authorities. Therefore, since Christ has 
come, the outward rule has been abolished. God no 
longer determines our outward person, time and place, 
but rules us spiritually through the Word, so that we are 
lords over everything that is outward and are not bound 
to any bodily thing. But what belongs to the spiritual rule 
has not been abolished, but still stands, as there are the 
laws in Moses of the love of God and of one's neighbor. 
God wants them to be kept and therefore gives the Holy 
Spirit to His believers so that they can keep them. 

In addition, the figures also remained spiritual, that 
is, that which is spiritually signified by the outward 
figures, even though it is outwardly abrogated. As that a 
man divorced his wife and let her go for the sake of 
adultery, that is a figure and meaning that is now also 
spiritually fulfilled. For thus God rejected the Jews, 
because they would not believe in Christ, and chose and 
accepted the Gentiles. Item, so he still does, if someone 
does not want to walk in faith, he lets him out of the 
Christian community, so that he improves himself. 
Similarly, after the death of her husband, a woman must 
take her husband's brother and beget children by him, 
and he must be named after him and be seated in his 
estate. This, although it has now ceased, is nevertheless 
a figure that also points to Christ; for he is our brother, 
died for us and ascended into heaven, and commanded 
us to make souls pregnant and fruitful through the 
gospel; so that we keep his name, are called after him, 
and also enter into his goods. Therefore | must not boast 
that | convert people, but must ascribe it all to the Lord 
Christ. So it is with all the other figures of the Old 
Testament, which would be too long to tell. 


1138 Erl. 5s, 3S-34. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. 


So everything that is not external is still in the Old 
Testament, as there are all the sayings of the prophets 
about faith and love; therefore Christ also confirms 
Matth. 7, 12: "All things whatsoever ye would that men 
should do to you, do ye even so to them: this is the law 
and the prophets. So Moses and the prophets are also 
witnesses of the future Christ. So when | preach about 
Christ, that he is the only Saviour, through whom 
everyone must be saved, | may take before me the 
saying Gen. 22:18: "In thy seed shall all the nations of 
the earth be blessed." From this | make a living voice, 
and say: Through Christ, who is Abraham's seed, all 
men must be blessed; from this it follows that in Adam 
we are all cursed and damned; therefore it is necessary 
that we believe in the seed, if we want to escape 
damnation otherwise. From such sayings we must lay a 
foundation of our faith, and let them remain, that we may 
see in them how they testify of Christ, that faith may be 
strengthened thereby. This is what St. Peter wants with 
these words when he speaks: 


V. 10: For what blessedness the prophets sought 
and searched, pointing to you of the grace to come. 


There we see that the dear prophets had a heartfelt 
desire for the grace and blessedness promised in Christ, 
and now offered and distributed to us and to all the world 
through the gospel, which we also certainly expect in 
hope through patience; they would also have liked to 
experience the time when it is revealed, and to see and 
hear that we see and hear, as Christ says Luc. 10:24; 
but it could not happen to them. But this they did, sighing 
for it with a hearty desire, and seeking and searching for 
it with great earnestness and diligence, pleasure and joy, 
in the promises made to the patriarchs, and explaining 
and expounding them more abundantly and extensively, 
and ministering them to us. But they have comforted 
themselves of the same grace and blessedness which 
was yet future, and [have] fallen asleep in the faith of 
Christ to come. This is what St. Peter means when he 
says: "After what blessedness" 2c. 





Peter. 1139 
In the same way St. Paul speaks Rom. 16, 25. 26: 
"After the revelation of the mystery, which was kept 
secret from the world, but now is revealed and made 
known through the prophetic writings. So you will find in 
the New Testament many sayings taken from the 
prophets, so that the apostles prove that everything 
happened as the prophets prophesied. So Christ himself 
proves from the prophet Isaiah that Messiah is present, 
when he says Matth. 11, 5: "The blind see, the lame 
walk, the poor have the gospel preached to them"; as if 
he should say: As it is written there, so it goes there. 
Item, so we read Apost. 9, 22. and 17, 2. f. by Paulo, and 
Cap. 18, 22. by Apollo, how they drove the Jews in and 
proved by the Scriptures that this Jesus, whom they 
proclaimed to them, was the true Messiah. For all that 
the prophets had proclaimed had come to pass 
concerning Christ. Item, Apost. 13, 46. 1) the apostles 
prove how the gospel should be preached to the 
Gentiles so that they would believe. All this took place, 
and the Jews were convicted and had to confess that it 
happened just as the Scriptures had said before. 


V.11. And have inquired what time and what 
manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in 
them pointed to. 


So St. Peter says: "Although the prophets did not 
actually know the certain and definite time, they did 
indicate in general all the circumstances of the time and 
place, such as how Christ would suffer, and what death 
he would die, and how the Gentiles would believe in him, 
so that one could certainly know by the signs when the 
time would be. Also they had the certain prophecy of 
Jacob the patriarch, that the kingdom of the Jews should 
first cease, before Christ should come; but the day and 
certain time, when it should come to pass, was not 
determined; for it was sufficient in that, when that time 
should come, that then they might know assuredly that 
Christ was not far off. The prophet Joel [Cap. 3, 1] also 
prophesied about the time when 


1) In the editions: Act. 15. 


1140 En. SS, 34-38. Second edition - Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 


The Holy Spirit should come, because he says: "And 
after this | will pour out my spirit on all flesh"; which 
saying St. Peter indicates Apost. 2, 17, and proves that 
he had just spoken of the time and certain persons. 

Methinks St. Peter meant especially the prophet 
Daniel, since he speaks here: "And have inquired what 
time and what manner of time the Spirit of Christ pointed 
to" 2c. "Which" means that he calculates the time and 
determines how long and how many years should be 
there, Dan. 9, 24. ff.; "which" means that he finely 
illustrates how it should go and stand in the world at the 
same time: who should have the supreme rule, or where 
the empire should be; that Daniel therefore not only 
announces the time, but also the change, form and 
nature of the same time 2c. 

From all this you see how with great diligence the 
apostles have always shown the reason and proof of 
their preaching and teaching from the prophets. Now the 
pope approaches and wants to deal with us without 
scripture, and commands that we believe him in the 
obedience of the church and in the ban. The apostles 
were full of the Holy Spirit and were sure that they were 
sent by Christ and preached the true gospel: They did 
not want anyone to believe them unless they proved it 
thoroughly from the Scriptures, that it was as they said, 
so that even the unbelievers' mouths might be shut, so 
that they could not raise anything against it; and we are 
to believe the coarse, unlearned heads, who preach no 
word of God at all, and can do no more than cry out 
forever: The fathers could not have erred, so the church 
has not taught and believed differently from us for 
several hundred years; therefore no account of it may be 
given. 

We can prove this from the Scriptures, that no one 
will be saved except he who believes in Christ, so that 
they can say nothing against it; but they will not prove 
their deed to us with Scriptures, that he will be 
condemned who does not fast on this or that day 2c.; 
therefore we do not want to and should not believe them. 
Now St. Peter goes on to say: 





11. 12. 1141 


V. 11. 12. and testified beforehand of the 
sufferings that are in Christ, and of the glory 
afterward to whom it is revealed. 


This may be understood of the two kinds of suffering 
that Christ and his own suffer, as St. Paul calls the 
suffering of all Christians Christ's suffering. For as the 
faith, the name, the word, and the work of Christ are 
ours, because we believe in him: so his suffering is also 
ours, and ours because we suffer for his sake. So the 
suffering of Christ is fulfilled daily in Christians until the 
end of the world. 

So this is our comfort in all our suffering, which is put 
on us for Christ's sake, that he counts the same for his 
own suffering; for Apost. 9, 4. He says, "Saul, Saul, why 
do you persecute me?" when Saul was not persecuting 
him, because he was too high for him, but was 
persecuting his believers; item, Zach. 2:8: "He that 
toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye"; and that 
we are sure that eternal glory will follow suffering. But as 
Christ, our Lord and Savior, had to suffer before He 
came to glory, so we will have to follow Him, first taking 
up the cross and bearing it after Him, and then awaiting 
eternal glory and joy. 

Therefore he says: "God's Spirit, who was in them, 
testified through them that whoever believes in Christ 
and confesses him should certainly judge himself 
according to this, that he must first suffer much, 
according to the example of his Lord, before he comes 
to glory. With this, St. Peter comforts all believers so that 
they do not get angry when they have to suffer all kinds 
of anguish and hardship, shame, contempt 2c. and 
despair, as if nothing would come of it, but rather be 
aware of the fact that all the prophets proclaimed from 
the revelation of the Holy Spirit that the cross must 
precede and that glory would certainly follow; for God 
first makes poor, then rich, first wounds and kills, then 
he heals and makes whole. The devil does the opposite. 

But that we now see the prophets so little 


1) suspicious - mindful. 


1142 en. ss, 36.38. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 1148 


The fact that we do not understand them makes the 
language unknown to us; otherwise they have spoken 
clearly enough. Therefore, those who know the 
language and have the Spirit of God (which all believers 
have) do not find it difficult to understand them, since 
they know that all Scripture is directed to teach us about 
faith, hope, love, patience in trials 2c. Whoever does not 
know or understand these things, and does not have the 
Spirit of God, is unfamiliar with the prophetic Scriptures 
and un-German, although, if one should lack one, it is 
better to have the Spirit without the language than the 
language without the Spirit. Although they have a 
peculiar way of speaking, they mean exactly what the 
apostles preach, for they have both said much about the 
suffering and glory of Christ and those who believe in 
him; as when David speaks of Christ Ps. 22:7: "| ama 
worm and not a man"; so that he indicates how deeply 
he is cast down and humbled in his suffering. So also in 
the 44th Psalm [v. 23] he writes of the Christians that 
they lament how they are persecuted and strangled by 
the enemies of the truth, and says: "We are strangled 
daily for your sake, and are esteemed like sheep for the 
slaughter" 2c. 


V. 12 For they presented it not to themselves, but 
to us; which is now preached unto you by them that 
preached the gospel unto you, through the Holy 
Ghost sent down from heaven. 


That is, the prophets would have liked to experience 
the blessed time of grace, and to hear Christ preaching 
at the present time, and to see miraculous signs 
performed, as he himself says in Matth. 13, 17: "The 
prophets and the righteous have desired to see" 2c. But 
because it could not be, they were satisfied that they, 
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, had seen from afar and 
recognized the grace and blessedness that was to come 
to all the world through Christ. But because they have 
left it behind them, they have done it for our good and 
love, and have been our servants and served us with it, 
so that we went to school with them and learned the 
same. How then did it come to us? "Through those who 
preached the gospel of Christ to you," who have a 


The Holy Spirit, whom Christ sent from heaven, opened 
their understanding so that they could understand the 
Scriptures and present them to others through preaching 
and writing. Here we have a strong foundation of faith, 
so that we can arm ourselves and protect ourselves 
against all false teaching. 


Which the angels also desire to behold. 


The apostles proclaimed such great things to us 
through the Holy Spirit, who came upon them from 
heaven, so that even the angels delight in beholding 
them. Then St. Peter tells us to open our eyes and see 
what the gospel is: we will have pleasure and delight in 
it, for it holds out to us other goods than all the riches 
and splendor of the world, namely, how we shall be 
saved from the power of the devil, freed from sin and 
death, and become children and heirs of God through 
Christ. We cannot yet see this with our bodily eyes, but 
must believe it, that we are partakers and fellow-citizens 
of the righteousness, truth, blessedness and_ all 
heavenly goods that God has; for since he gave Christ, 
his only Son, the highest good, for all of us, how should 
he not give us all things with him? Rom. 8:32, namely 
grace, righteousness, eternal life and blessedness, of 
which the angels in heaven have all joy and delight. All 
these things are offered to us through the gospel, and if 
we believe, we will also have such joy and pleasure. But 
our joy and pleasure cannot be as perfect as the angel 
is, because we still live on earth in the devil's kingdom. 
Now it may well begin in us to feel something of it 
through faith, but in heaven the joy is so great that no 
human heart can comprehend it; now when we get 
there, we will feel it too. 

So far St. Peter has indicated what the gospel is for 
a doctrine, namely, which testifies of Christ, that through 
his death and resurrection we are born again to an 
incorruptible inheritance, 2c. and as it was proclaimed 
before by the prophets, that it should thus come to pass 
and be preached; points out to us 


1144 Eni. 52, 38-40. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 12. 


13. 1145 





so into the Scriptures that we may receive comfort and 
strengthening of faith from it, and so equip and arm 
ourselves against all the fiery darts of the devil, 
temptations of the world, melancholy and sadness of 
heart 2c. Now he continues, exhorting us to adhere to 
the same preaching of the gospel by faith, and to follow 
it by love, saying thus: 


V. 13. Therefore gird up the loins of your mind. 


This is an exhortation to faith, and this is the opinion: 
Because such unspeakable treasure is proclaimed to 
you and given to you through the gospel, of which also 
the angels in heaven rejoice and delight to behold, 
therefore cling to it, and put your trust in it with all your 
mind, so that it may be a righteous faith and not a colored 
or made-up delusion and dream. 

St. Peter does not speak here of a bodily girding, as 
a man girds his sword to his loins, but of a spiritual 
girding of the mind, which Christ also touched Luc. 
12:35, when he says, "Let your loins be girded." In 
several places in Scripture, loins are called the bodily 
girding of unchastity; in this way, "gird up your loins" 
means to curb unchastity and to live chastely. Also, the 
scripture calls loins, since natural birth comes from the 
father. Thus we read in Gen. 35, 11. of Jacob that God 
promises him that kings shall come from his loins 2c., 
and Apost. 2, 30: David knew that the fruit of his loins 
should sit on his throne. 

But the spiritual girding (of which the apostle says 
here) goes like this: As a virgin is bodily pure and 
incorrupt, so the soul is spiritually incorrupt through faith, 
by which it becomes Christ's bride. But if it falls from faith 
to false doctrine, it must be put to shame; therefore 
Scripture everywhere calls idolatry and unbelief adultery 
and fornication, that is, when the soul clings to the 
doctrines of men, and so lets faith and Christ fall away. 
This is what St. Peter means here, since 1) he says to 
us 


1) Wittenberger: that. 





to gird up the loins of the mind, as if to say, "Now that 
you have heard the gospel and have come into the faith, 
see to it that you continue in it and are not moved by false 
teaching, so that you do not waver and run back and 
forth with works. 

And here he speaks in a special way, as he says: the 
loins of your mind. Mind" is what we call "being minded," 
as when | say, "This seems right to me;" and as St. Paul 
speaks: Thus we hold it, thus we are minded. In this way 
he is actually referring to faith, and thus wants to say: 
"You have created a righteous mind, that one must be 
justified before God by faith alone; remain in this mind, 
gird it well, hold fast to it, and do not let yourselves be 
torn away from it, and you will stand well. For many false 
teachers shall arise, and set up doctrines of men, to 
pervert your minds, and to loose the girdle of your faith: 
therefore be warned, and take heed. The hypocrites, 
who stand on their works and therefore walk in an 
honorable, fine life, are so minded that God has to take 
them to heaven for their works, are puffed up and ride 
high, stand hard on their mind and conceit, like the 
Pharisee Luc. 18, 11. f., of whom also Mary says in the 
Magnificat that she needs the very word that is written 
here in St. Peter: "He scatters those who are hopeful in 
their hearts" [Luc. 2, 51]. 


Be sober. 


Sobriety serves the body externally and is the most 
important part of faith. For even though a man has been 
justified by faith, he is not yet completely free from evil 
desires. Faith has begun to subdue the flesh, but it is still 
stirring and raging in all kinds of lusts that want to come 
forth again and do its bidding. Therefore the spirit has to 
work daily to tame and subdue it, and must beat with it 
without ceasing, and take heed to the flesh, lest it repel 
faith. Therefore they deceive themselves who say that 
they have faith, and think that this is enough, and that 
they have no desire, when they fulfill the lusts of the 
flesh. Where faith is right

Peter. 





When the body is in a state of disorder, it must attack the 
body and keep it in check, so that it does not do what it 
desires. That is why St. Peter says that we should be 
sober. 

But he does not want the body to be ruined or 
weakened too much, as many are found who have 
fasted and martyred themselves to death. St. Bernard 
was also for a time in such foolishness, although he was 
otherwise a holy man, that he broke off so much from the 
body that his breath became stinking 1) and could not be 
with the people; but he came out again afterwards, and 
also forbade his brothers that they should not hurt the 
body too much. For he saw well that he had made 
himself unfit to serve his brothers. Therefore St. Peter 
demands no more than that we should be sober, that is, 
break off from the body as far as we feel that it is still too 
horny. He does not determine a certain time for fasting, 
as the pope has done, but rather he instructs each 
person to fast in such a way that he always remains 
sober and does not load his body with stuffing, so that 
he may remain sane and rational and fast as much as is 
necessary for him to fast his body. For it is no good at all 
to put a commandment on a whole multitude and 
common people, since we are so unequal among 
ourselves, one strong and another weak in body, that 
one must break off much and the other little, so that the 
body may remain healthy and able to do good. 

But that the ruffians fall in, and so want to go well, 
that they cannot fast and eat meat, is also not right. For 
these also do not grasp the gospel, and are of no more 
use than the others, doing no more than despising the 
commandment of the priest, and yet do not want to gird 
up their mind and spirit, as St. Peter says, leaving the 
body its will to remain slothful and lustful. It is good to 
fast; but that is right fasting, not to give the body more 
food than it needs to keep it healthy, and let it work and 
watch, so that the old ass does not become too wanton 
and go dancing on the ice, and break a leg, but walk in 
the bridle, and follow the spirit; not,

as those do who fill themselves so full with fish and the 
best wine from once when they are juicing that their 
stomachs thirst. 2) That is called here St. Peter sober, 
and now says further: 


And place your hope entirely in the grace that is 
offered to you. 


Christian faith is thus skilful in that it freely places itself 
on God's word with complete trust, freely ventures on it, 
and joyfully goes up to it. That is why St. Peter speaks: 
Then the loins of your mind are girded, and your faith is 
righteous, if you dare to do it, whatever it may be, good, 
honor, body or life. So with these words he has very 
finely described a righteous, uncolored faith. It does not 
have to be a lazy and sleepy faith or dream, but a living 
and active thing, that one gives oneself to it with all one's 
mind and clings to the word, God granting that we may 
get through fortune and misfortune as we please. When 
| am about to die, | have to consider Christ freshly, 
stretch out my neck freely, and defy the Word of God, 
which cannot lie to me. Faith must go straight through, 
not be deceived, and put out of sight all things that it 
sees, hears, and feels. St. Peter demands such a faith, 
which does not stand in thoughts or words, but in such 
power. 

On the other hand, St. Peter says: Put your hope in 
the grace that is offered to you; that is, you have not 
earned the great grace, but it is offered to you freely. For 
the gospel which proclaims this grace we did not devise 
nor invent, but the Holy Spirit sent it down from heaven 
into the world. But what is offered to us? That which we 
have heard above: He that believeth on Christ, and 
cleaveth to the word, hath him with all his goods, to be 
lord over sin, death, the devil, and hell, and to have 
eternal life. This treasure is brought to our doorstep and 
placed in our bosom, without our doing or merit, yes, 
unawares and without our knowledge or thought. 
Therefore

13.14. 1149 





the apostles, that we should look forward to it with joy. 
For God, who offers us such grace, will certainly not lie 
to us. 


Through the revelation of Jesus Christ. 


God allows no one to offer fine grace except through 
Christ; therefore, no man should dare to come before 
him without this mediator, as we have heard enough 
above. For he will hear no man, except he bring with him 
Christ his dear Son, whom alone he looks upon, and for 
his sake they also that cleave unto him. Therefore he 
wants us to know the Son, as we have been reconciled 
to the Father through his blood, so that we may come 
before him. For to this end the Lord Christ came, taking 
on himself flesh and blood, and clinging to us, that he 
might obtain for us such grace from the Father. Thus all 
the prophets and patriarchs were also preserved and 
saved through such faith in Christ, for they all had to 
believe in the saying that God said to Abraham: 
"Through your seed shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed." Therefore, as we have said, the faith of the 
Jews and the Turks is of no account, and of those who 
stand on their works, and thereby want to go to heaven. 
Alfo speaks St. Peter: Grace is offered to you, but 
through the revelation of Jesus Christ, or (to make it 
clearer) because Jesus Christ is revealed to you. 

Through the gospel it is made known to us what 
Christ is, so that we may know him, that he is our Savior, 
takes away sin and death from us, and helps us out of 
all misfortune, reconciles us to the Father, and makes us 
godly and blessed without our works. Whoever does not 
recognize Christ in this way must be lacking. For even 
though you know that he is the Son of God, dead and 
risen from the dead, and seated at the right hand of the 
Father, you have not yet rightly recognized Christ, nor 
does he yet help you; but you must know and believe 
that he did it all for your sake, to help you. Therefore it is 
a useless thing what has been preached and taught in 
high schools, which have not known anything about this 
knowledge, and have come no further than to consider 
how painful the suffering of the Lord Christ was, and how 
he is now 





| will sit idle in heaven and have joy with him, but my heart 
will remain dry and faith will not come alive in it. 

The Lord Christ shall not stand for himself, but shall 
be preached that he is ours. Otherwise, why would it 
have been necessary for him to come to earth and shed 
his blood? Since he was sent into the world for this 
reason, as he says in John 3:17, that the world might be 
saved through him, he must have done what he was sent 
by the Father to do. For the sending and going forth from 
the Father is not to be understood according to the divine 
nature alone, but according to the human nature and his 
ministry. AS soon as he was baptized, this began, and 
accomplished that for which he was sent and came into 
the world, namely, that he should preach the truth, and 
that he should shew forth this unto us, 1) that whosoever 
believeth in him should be saved. So he revealed himself 
and made himself known, and offered grace to us 
himself. 


v. 14. As children of obedience. 


That is, present yourselves as the obedient children. 
Obedience is the name of faith in the Scriptures. But the 
pope with his high schools and monasteries has also torn 
apart this little word for us and pointed to their lie, what 
is written about this obedience, as the saying 1 Sam. 15, 
22: "Obedience is better than sacrifice. For since they 
see that obedience is much praised in the Scriptures, 
they have taken it to themselves, that they may deceive 
the people, that they may think that theirs is the 
obedience of which the Scriptures speak. So they bring 
us from God's word to their lies and devil's obedience. 
He who hears the gospel and God's word and believes it 
is an obedient son of God; therefore, whatever is not 
God's word, trample it underfoot and do not turn away 
from it. 


And do not stand the same as before, when you 
lived in ignorance according to lusts. 


That is, do not make such gestures with change, as 
before. Before, you were idolatrous, living in unbelief, 
unchastity,

Eating, drinking, greed, pride, anger, envy and hatred; 
these were evil, pagan things, in which you walked like 
the blind, not knowing what you had done. Now put away 
these same evil lusts. 

Here you see how he blames ignorance for all the 
misfortunes that come from it. For where there is no faith 
and the knowledge of Christ, there remains all error and 
blindness, so that one does not know what is right and 
what is wrong. This is how it has been until now; since 
Christ has perished and been obscured, error has set in; 
the question of how one could be saved has spread 
throughout the whole world. That is already a sign of 
blindness or ignorance, that the right understanding of 
faith has gone out, and no one knows anything about it 
anymore. That is why the world is so full of various sects, 
and everything has been divided, because everyone 
wants to make his own way to heaven. Out of misfortune 
we must always fall deeper into blindness, because we 
cannot help ourselves. That is why St. Peter says: "You 
have been deceived enough, so now stop, because you 
have become knowledgeable and have come to a right 
mind. 


V.15. 16. But according to him that hath called 
you, and is holy, be ye also holy in all your doings. For 
it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy. 


There St. Peter cites a saying from the Old 
Testament, Deut. 19, 2. God says: "You shall be holy, for 
lam holy"; that is, because | am your Lord and God, and 
you are my people, you shall also be as | am. For a true 
Lord makes his people like him, and they walk in 
obedience, and do the will of the Lord. Therefore, as God 
our Lord is holy, so his people are also holy; therefore 
we are all holy if we walk by faith. 

Scripture does not speak much of departed saints, 
but of those who live from the earth. So the prophet 
David boasts Ps. 86, 2: "Lord, keep my soul, for | am 
holy. But here our scholars have once again reversed 
the saying and say that the prophet had a special 
revelation. 





Peter. 1151 
that he calls himself holy. Thus they themselves confess 
that they lack faith and do not have the revelation of 
Christ; otherwise they would feel it. For he who is a 
Christian feels such revelation in himself; but those who 
do not feel it are not Christians. For he that is a Christian 
enters into fellowship with the Lord Christ in all his goods; 
and because Christ is holy, he must also be holy, or deny 
that Christ is holy. If you have been baptized, you have 
put on the holy garment that is Christ, as St. Paul says 
Gal. 3:27. 

The little word "holy" means that which is God's own 
and due to Him alone, which we call "consecrated" in 
German. So now St. Peter says: You have now given 
yourselves to God as your own, therefore see to it that 
you do not let yourselves be led again into worldly 
pleasures, but let God alone rule, live and work in you, 
so that you are holy, as He is holy. 

So far he has described the grace that is offered to 
us through the gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, 
and taught us how we should hold ourselves against it, 
namely, that we remain on a pure, unaltered sense of 
faith, so that we know that no work that we can do or 
think up can help us anything before God. If one 
preaches such things, then reason goes and says: "Well, 
if that is true, then | must not do any good work; so the 
coarse heads fall on it, and make a carnal freedom out 
of the Christian being, thinking that they may do what 
they like. St. Peter meets them here and comes before 
them and teaches how one must use Christian freedom 
against God alone. For there is nothing more necessary 
than the faith that | give God His glory and consider Him 
to be my God, that He is just, true and merciful. Such 
faith makes us free from sin and all evil. If | have given 
such to God, what | then live, | live for the benefit of my 
neighbor, so that | serve and help him. The greatest work 
that follows from faith is that | confess Christ with my 
mouth, testify to him with my blood, and put life where it 
should be. God is not allowed to do this work either, but 
| should do it so that my faith may be proven and 
confessed, so that 


1152 Erl. 5s, 47-50. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 15-17. 


other people are also brought to faith. After that, other 
works follow, which must all be directed to serve the 
neighbor, which God must do in us. Therefore, it is not 
valid to raise a carnal being and do what we desire. 
Therefore, St. Peter speaks: 


Vv. 17 And since ye call upon him the Father, who 
judgeth without respect of persons, according to 
every man's work, conduct yourselves with fear all 
the days of your sojourning. 


So St. Peter says: Ye are now come by faith to be the 
children of GOD, and he is your Father, and have 
obtained an inheritance incorruptible in heaven (as he 
said above): now therefore there remaineth no more, but 
that the cloth be taken away, and that uncovered which 
is now hid; whereof ye must yet wait until ye shall see it. 
Forasmuch then as ye are come to the state that ye may 
cheerfully call God Father, yet is he so just that he giveth 
to every man according to his works, and regardeth not 
the person. 

Therefore, even if you have the great name of 
Christian or son of God, you must not think that He will 
spare you if you live without fear and think that it is 
enough to boast of this name. The world judges 
according to the person, so that it does not punish 
everyone equally, and spares those who are friends, 
rich, beautiful, learned, wise and powerful; but God does 
not consider any of them, everything is equal to Him, no 
matter how great the person may be. Thus in Egypt he 
slew the first son of Pharaoh the king as well as the first 
son of the least man. For this reason the apostle wants 
us to take this judgment to God and to stand in fear, so 
that we do not boast of the title that we are Christians 
and rely on it, as if he would be more lenient with us for 
this reason than with other people. For this also 
deceived the Jews of old, who boasted that they were 
Abraham's seed and God's people. The Scripture 
makes no distinction according to the flesh, but 
according to the spirit. It is true that he promised that 
Christ would be born of Abraham, and that a holy man 
would be born of Abraham. 


1153 


People come from him; but it does not follow that all who 
are born of Abraham are God's children. He also 
promised that the Gentiles would be saved, but did not 
say that he would save all the Gentiles. 

Now there is a question: Since we say that God alone 
makes us blessed through faith, without regard to works, 
why does St. Peter say that he does not judge according 
to the person, but according to works? Answer: What we 
have taught, how faith alone makes us righteous in the 
sight of God, is true beyond all doubt, since it is so clear 
from Scripture that it cannot be denied; that now here the 
apostle says that God judges according to works is also 
true; but for this it must certainly be held that where there 
is no faith, there can be no good works that God gives, 
and again, that where there are no good works, there is 
no faith. Therefore, join faith and good works together, 
so that the sum of the whole Christian life is in the two; 
not that works do anything for justification before God, 
but that faith without them does not exist, or is not true 
faith. Therefore, even if God judges us according to our 
works, it still remains true that works alone are the fruits 
of faith, by which one can see where faith or unbelief is. 
Therefore, God will judge you by your works and 
convince you that you have believed or not believed. 
Just as a liar cannot be judged and convicted more 
accurately than from his words; nor is it evident that he 
does not become a liar by his words, but was a liar before 
he told a lie, for the lie must come from the heart into the 
mouth. 

Therefore, understand this saying in the simplest 
way, that works are fruits and signs of faith, and that God 
judges people according to such fruits, which must 
surely follow, so that one may publicly see where faith or 
unbelief is in the heart. God will not judge whether you 
are called a Christian or baptized, but will ask you: If you 
are a Christian, tell me, where are the fruits so that you 
can prove your faith? 

Therefore, St. Peter says: Since you have such a 
father, who is not according to the per 


1154 Eni. [s, 50-52. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1155 





son, conduct your affairs with fear as long as you live 
here; that is, fear the Father, not for the sake of 
chastisement and punishment, as the unbelievers and 
the devil fear, but lest he forsake you and withdraw his 
hand; as a pious child fears lest he anger his father and 
do something that would not please him. This is the fear 
that God wants to have in us, so that we may guard 
against sins and serve our neighbor, because we live 
here on earth. 

A Christian, if he believes righteously, has Christ with 
all his goods as his own, and is God's Son, as we have 
heard. But the time he is still alive is only a pilgrimage, 
for the spirit is already in heaven through faith, by which 
he is lord over all things. For this reason God allows him 
to still live in the flesh and to walk the earth in his body, 
so that he may help other people and also bring them to 
heaven. Therefore we have no other use for all things on 
earth, except as a sojourner who travels overland and 
comes to an inn, where he must lie down for the night, 
and takes only food and lodging from the host, do not 
say that the host's goods are his 2c. So we should also 
deal with temporal goods as if they were not ours, and 
enjoy only as much of them as we need to maintain the 
body, helping our neighbor with the rest. So the Christian 
life is only a night's lodging, for we have no lasting place 
here, but must go where the Father is, namely to 
heaven; therefore we should not live here in ease, but 
stand in fear, says St. Peter. 


v. 18. 19. And know that you have not been 
redeemed with corruptible silver or gold from your 
vain walk after the manner of your fathers, but with 
the precious blood of Christ. 


This is to provoke you, he says, to the fear of God, in 
which you are to stand, that you may remember how 
much it has taken for you to be redeemed. Before you 
were citizens in the world, and sat under the devil; but 
now God has torn you out of such a state, and put you 
into another state, that you are citizens in heaven, but 
strangers and sojourners on earth; therefore lead your 
way with fear, and see to it that you do not despise these 
things, and lose the noble, precious treasure, 


that God has sent to you to be redeemed, and to come 
to the glory that you are now God's children. 

What then is the treasure that we may be redeemed? 
Not perishable gold or silver, but the precious blood of 
Christ, the Son of God. The treasure is so precious and 
noble that no human mind and reason can comprehend 
that only a drop of this innocent blood would have been 
enough for all the sins of the world; nor did the Father 
want to pour out such abundant grace upon us, and let 
it stand so much that he allowed his only Son, Christ, to 
shed all his blood, and gave us the treasure in its 
entirety. Therefore, he does not want us to throw such 
great grace to the wind and consider it small, but to be 
moved to live with fear, so that this treasure will not be 
taken away from us. 

And here it is to be noted that St. Peter says: "You 
are redeemed from your vain walk according to your 
father's statutes or ways; for with this he knocks down 
all the support on which we stand, and think that our 
thing must be right, because it has been granted from 
time immemorial, and our forefathers all kept it so, 
among whom there were also wise and pious people. 
For thus he says, "All that our fathers established and 
did was evil; what you learned of worship from them is 
also evil, that it cost the Son of God his blood to redeem 
men from it. Now whatever is not washed by the blood 
is all poisoned and cursed by the flesh. From this it 
follows that the more a man sets himself to be godly and 
does not have Christ, the more he hinders himself, and 
the deeper he falls into blindness and wickedness, and 
condemns himself by the precious blood. 

The outward, gross sins against the other table are 
still small compared to this, that one teaches how to 
become pious by our own works and merits, and to 
worship according to our reason, which are sins against 
the first table, by which the innocent blood is most 
dishonored and blasphemed. So the heathen did much 
greater sin in that they worshipped the sun and the 
moon and their idols, which they thought was the right 
worship. 


1156 en. 52, 52.54. Second edit. Sermon on | Petr, 1, 18-21. 


1157 





than with other sins. Therefore, human piety is 
blasphemy and the greatest sin a human being can 
commit. This is also the way the world deals with it now, 
namely, that which it considers to be godliness and the 
highest piety is worse in the sight of God than any other 
sin, such as being a priest or a monk, and what seems 
good in the sight of the world, and yet is without faith. 
Therefore, whoever does not want to obtain grace from 
God through the blood of Christ had better never appear 
before God's eyes, for he will only anger His Majesty 
more and more. 


As an innocent and unblemished lamb. 


Now St. Peter interprets the Scriptures, for it is a 
mighty, rich epistle, although it is short; as now, when he 
has spoken of the vain walk according to the fatherly 
statutes, he also meets many sayings in the prophets, as 
in the prophet Jeremiah Cap. 16, 19: "The heathen shall 
come unto thee from the end of the world, saying: Our 
fathers have gone about with lies," 2c.; as if St. Peter 
were to say, "The prophets also proclaimed that you 
Gentiles should be redeemed from the paternal statutes 
by the precious blood of Christ," 2c. So here he also 
wants to point us to the Scriptures when he says: "You 
are redeemed by the blood of Christ, as an innocent and 
unblemished lamb"; and transfigures what is written in 
the prophets and Moses, as Isaiah, Cap. 53, 7: Like a 
lamb he is led to the slaughter; item, the figure 2 Mos. 
12, 2. ff. of the paschal lamb; all this he interprets here, 
and says that Christ is this unblemished and innocent 
lamb, through that of which it is written in Ex. 12, 5. to be 
without blemish, means whose blood was shed for our 
sin. 


V. 20. Who, though provided before the 
foundation of the world was laid, will be revealed in 
the last days. 


That is, we have not earned it, nor have we ever asked 
God to shed the precious blood of Christ for us; therefore 
we can boast of nothing, the glory belongs to no one but 
God alone; God has promised it to us without any merit 
on our part, and has also revealed or made known that 
which He has provided and ordained from eternity, 
before the creation of the world. 





is. In the prophets it was also promised, but in secret and 
not publicly; but now, after the resurrection of Christ and 
the sending of the Holy Spirit, it has been publicly 
preached and sounded throughout the world. 

But the last time, of which St. Peter speaks here, is 
the time of grace, when the gospel is preached in all the 
world by the apostles after the ascension of Christ, and 
will continue until the last day. The prophets, apostles 
and Christ Himself also call it the last hour, not that as 
soon as after Christ's ascension the last day would 
come, but because after this preaching of the gospel of 
Christ no other shall come, and not be revealed and 
transfigured better than it is transfigured and revealed. 
For before Christ's future in the flesh, one revelation after 
another has always gone out; therefore God says Ex. 
6:3: "My name, O Lord, | have not made known to them." 
For the patriarchs, even though they knew God, did not 
at the same time have such a public preaching of God as 
went out afterwards through Moses and the prophets. 
Now no more glorious and public preaching has come 
into the world than the Gospel; therefore it is the last. All 
times have now passed away, but now at last it is 
revealed to us. 

On the other hand, it is not long until the end of the 
world, as St. Peter explains in 2 Peter 3:8, where he 
says: "One day in the sight of the Lord is like a thousand 
years, and a thousand years like one day"; thus he wants 
to lead us from the reckoning of this time, so that we may 
judge according to the sight of God; since it is the last 
time, and already has an end; but what still remains is 
nothing in the sight of God. The blessedness is now 
already revealed and completed, but God leaves the 
world still longer, so that His name may continue to be 
honored and praised, even though it has already been 
revealed for itself in the most perfect way. 


V. 20. 21. For your sake, who through him believe 
in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him 
glory, that you might have faith and hope in God. 

For our sake (he says) Christ is revealed through the 
gospel; for neither GOD nor 


1158 Eri. 52, 54-57. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. 


1159 


Peter. 





He needed it, but it was for our benefit that we believed 
in God, and that not through ourselves, but through 
Christ, who redeemed us through his holy blood and 
represents us to God the Father, whom for this very 
reason he gave into death and raised again, and 
preached repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the 
world through his name, so that all who believe in him 
have access to the Father through him, without which 
they can never come to him. Thus we have faith in God, 
and also a hope through the same faith: faith alone 
makes us blessed, but it must be faith in God; for if God 
does not help, you are not helped, even if you have the 
friendship of all men. Therefore you must have God's 
friendship, so that you may boast that he is your father 
and you are his child, trusting him more than your 
biological father and mother, that he will help you in all 
your needs, and this only through the one Mediator and 
Savior, the Lord Christ. Therefore he says that such faith 
does not come from human powers, but God creates it 
in us, because Christ earned it with his blood, to whom 
he therefore gave the glory and put it at his right hand, 
that he created such faith in us by God's power. 

So far we have heard how St. Peter admonishes us 
to gird up the loins of our minds, so that we may remain 
pure and live by faith; then, since our redemption has 
cost such a precious treasure, we should walk with fear 
and not rely on being called Christians, since God is 
such a judge that he does not ask for anyone, judging 
one as well as another, without distinction of persons. 
Now he continues, and concludes the first chapter: 


V. 22. And chastise your souls in obedience to the 
truth through the Spirit. 


St. Paul tells Gal. 5, 22. the fruits that follow faith; so St. 
Peter also says here that a fruit of faith is when we make 
our souls chaste in obedience to the truth through the 
Spirit. For where faith is righteous, it casts the body 
under itself, and compels the air of the flesh; and 





Although he does not kill him, he makes him submissive 
and obedient to the Spirit and keeps him in check. This 
is what St. Paul means when he speaks of the fruit of 
the Spirit. It is a great work that the Spirit should have 
dominion over the flesh, and tame the evil desire which 
is inborn in us from father and mother; for it is not 
possible without grace that we should live chastely in 
marriage, let alone illegitimately. 

But why does he say, "Make your souls chaste"? He 
knows well that the lust of the flesh after baptism 
remains in us until the grave; therefore it is not enough 
for one to abstain from the work, and remain chaste 
outwardly, and let the evil lusts 1) remain in the heart; 
but one must strive for the soul to be chaste by faith, so 
that it comes out of the heart, and the soul is free from 
the evil lusts and desires, and always be beaten with 
them until it is rid of them. 

Here he adds a fine addition, that one should make 
the soul chaste "in obedience to the truth through the 
spirit". Much has been preached about chastity, and 
many books have been written about it; they have said 
that one should fast so long, one should not eat meat, 
one should not drink wine, etc., that one may be rid of 
temptation. It may have helped a little, but it was not 
enough, for the evil desires of the heart cannot be 
subdued in this way. St. Jerome wrote of himself that he 
had prepared his body in such a way that he had 
become like a Moor; nevertheless, it had not helped, and 
he had still dreamed how he was in Rome at the singing 
dance among the meizes. St. Bernard also hurt him very 
much, corrupted his body so that he stank, as | said 
above. They had a hard time, and thought they would 
dampen it with external things; but because it is external, 
the plaster is only on the outside, not on the inside; 
therefore it is not enough to dampen the desire. 

But here St. Peter has given a proper remedy for it, 
namely the obedience of truth through the Spirit; as 
Scripture also does in other places, as Is. 11:5: "Faith 


1) Erlanger: evil desire. 


1160 en. 52, 57-58. 


will be a girdle of his kidneys"; this is the right plaster that 
girds the kidneys. It must come out from within, not from 
without; for it is grown in the blood and flesh, marrow and 
veins, not on the outside in the cloth nor in the garment; 
therefore it is not advisable for him to curb lust with 
external things. The body can be weakened and killed 
with fasting and work, but the evil desire cannot be 
driven out with it; faith, however, can dampen it and 
prevent it, so that it must leave room for the spirit. Thus 
also the prophet Zacharias speaks of a wine, which 
Christ has, of which virgins grow, which he gives them 
to drink. The other wine tends to provoke evil desire; but 
this wine, that is, the gospel, curbs it, and makes chaste 
hearts. This is what St. Peter says, that if one grasps the 
truth with the heart, and is obedient to it through the 
spirit, this is the right remedy and is the most powerful 
medicine for it; otherwise you will not find any that could 
thus quench all evil thoughts. For when this comes into 
the heart, the evil inclination soon goes away. Try it, 
whoever wants to, will find it, and those who have tried it 
know it well. But the devil does not let anyone come to it 
easily and take hold of the word of God so that it tastes 
good to him, for he knows well how powerful it is to curb 
evil desires and thoughts. 

So now St. Peter wants to say: If you want to remain 
chaste, you must grasp "the obedience of the truth 
through the Spirit", that is, one must not only read and 
hear the Word of God, but the Holy Spirit must write it in 
the heart 2c. Therefore it is not enough that one 
preaches or hears the gospel once, but one must always 
press on and continue. For such is the grace of the word: 
the more it is acted upon, the sweeter it becomes; 
though it be always one doctrine of faith, yet it cannot be 
heard too much, where there are not hearts too bold and 
raw. Now the apostle adds: 


To undyed brotherly love. 


Why should we lead a chaste life? That we may be 
saved by it? No, but to serve our neighbor. What shall | 
do to ward off my sin? | 


Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 22. 





1161 


is to grasp the obedience of truth through the spirit, that 
is, faith in God's word. Why do | resist it? Because | must 
first tame the body and the flesh through the Spirit, and 
then | can be useful to other people. Follow on: 


And love one another fervently from a pure heart. 


The apostles St. Peter and Paul distinguish brotherly 
love and common love. Brotherhood is that Christians 
should all be like brothers, and make no distinction 
among them. For since we all have one Christ in 
common, one baptism, one faith, one treasure, | am no 
better than you; | also have that which you have, and am 
as rich as you. The treasure is the same, though | may 
have laid hold of it more than thou, so that | have laid 
hold of it in gold, but thou hast laid hold of it in a poor 
cloth. Therefore, as we have in common the grace of 
Christ and all spiritual goods, so we also ought to have 
in common life and limb, goods and honor, that we may 
serve one another in all things. 

Now he speaks clearly, "In undyed brotherly love." 
The apostles are fond of this word and have seen that 
we would be called Christians and brothers among 
ourselves, but it would be a false, dyed or made-up thing, 
and would only be glitter. The pope has established 
much brotherhood in the world, and given many 
indulgences for it; but they are all lies and deception, 
which the devil has devised through him and brought into 
the world, which only fight against the right faith and 
righteous brotherly love. Christ is mine as well as St. 
Bernard's, yours as well as St. Francis. Now if someone 
comes and says that | should go to heaven if | am in this 
or that brotherhood, say: It is a lie; for Christ cannot suffer 
it, does not want to have any other brotherhood than the 
common brotherhood that all believers have among 
themselves; then you fool come here and want to 
establish your own. This | would allow to be made, not 
for the benefit of the soul, but for the benefit of some who 
would put in one and make a treasure, from which those 
who would have it would be helped. 


1162 ca. {s, 59-61. Interpretations on the | Epistle of St. Peter. 1163 


So we Christians have all received one brotherhood 
in baptism; no saint has more of it than | and you. For 
just as much as he was bought, so much am | bought; 
God has given as much to me as to the greatest saint; 
without only that he may have a better grasp of the 
treasure and a stronger faith than | do. 

Love, however, is greater than brotherhood, for it also 
reaches out to enemies, and especially to those who are 
not worthy of love. For as faith does its work when it sees 
nothing, so love also should see nothing, and should do 
its work most where there seems nothing lovely, but only 
displeasure and hostility; where there is nothing that 
pleases me, | should for that very reason put up with it. 
And this should be done fervently, says St. Peter, with 
all my heart, as God has loved us, since we were not 
worthy of love. Now follows further: 


V. 23: When they were born again. 


Therefore do this: for you are no longer children of 
wrath, as before (he says), but new men. This was not 
done by works, but it took birth. For you cannot make the 
new man, but he must grow or be born; as a carpenter 
cannot make a tree, but he must himself grow out of the 
ground; as we were not made the children of Adam, but 
were born, and brought sin from our father and mother: 
so also it cannot be by works that we become the 
children of God, but must also be born again. This is 
what the apostle wants to say: Because you are now a 
new creature, you should now also keep yourselves 
differently and lead a new life. As you lived in hatred 
before, so you must now walk in love; however, in a 
contrary way. But how did the new birth happen? Well, 
as follows: 


Not from perishable seed, but from imperishable 
seed, namely from the living Word of God, which 
abides forever. 

By a seed we are born again; for no thing grows 


differently, as we see, but from seed. If now the old birth 
is from a seed, then must be 





the new birth can also be from a seed. But what is the 
seed? Not flesh and blood. What is it? It is not 
perishable, but God's eternal Word, which gives new 
birth, life and salvation to those who believe in it. 

How does this work? God lets the word of the Gospel 
go out and the seed fall into the hearts of men. Where it 
sticks in the heart, the Holy Spirit is there and gives birth 
anew; there becomes another person, other thoughts, 
other words and works. So you are completely changed: 
everything you fled from, you seek, and what you sought 
before, you flee. In the bodily birth it goes like this: When 
the seed is received, it is changed, so that there is no 
more seed. But this 1) is aseed that cannot be changed, 
it remains eternally; but it changes me, so that | am 
changed into it, and what is evil in me of my nature even 
passes away. Therefore it is ever a strange birth and 
from a strange seed. Now St. Peter speaks further: 


For all flesh is like grass, and all the glory of men 
like the flower of grass. The grass is withered, and 
the flower is fallen: but the word of the LORD 
abideth for ever. 


This saying is taken from the prophet Isaiah, Cap. 40, 
6-8, where he says: "Preach! What shall | preach? All 
flesh is hay, and all its goodness is like a flower of the 
field. The hay withers, the flower fades; but the word of 
our God endures forever." These are the words of St. 
Peter. For this, as | have said, is a true epistle, and well 
peppered with scriptures. So now the Scripture says that 
God's word abides forever. What is flesh and blood is 
perishable like hay and grass, if it is young, so that it 
blossoms; item, if it is rich, powerful, wise and pious, so 
that it grows green (which all belongs to the flower), 
nevertheless the flower begins to thorn. What is young 
and beautiful becomes old and ugly; what is rich 
becomes poor; and so henceforth, and must all fall by 
the word of God. But this seed cannot perish. Now St. 
Peter concludes: 


1) Wittenberger: dir. 


1164 Erl. tis, 6i-63. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 1, 25. 


1165 





This is the word that is proclaimed among you. 

As if to say: You must not open your eyes wide when 
you come to the word of God, you have it before your 
eyes; it is the word that we preach. There you can curb 
all evil desire with it, you must not fetch it far; do not do 
more than that you catch it when it is preached. For it is 
so near that it can be heard, as Moses also says Deut. 
30:11 ff: "The word which | command thee is not far from 
thee, that thou shouldest run far after it, or go up to 
heaven, or pass over the sea: but it is near thee, even in 
thy mouth, and in thine heart.” It is soon spoken and 
heard, but when it comes into the heart, it cannot die or 
pass away, nor let thee die; so long as thou cleavest to 
it, so long dost it keep thee. So when | hear that Jesus 
Christ died, took away my sin, and purchased heaven for 
me, and gave me all that he has, then | hear the gospel. 
The word is soon passed away when it is preached; but 
when it falls into the heart, and is grasped with faith, it 
can never fall away. No creature can overthrow this truth; 
the foundation of hell can do nothing against it, and even 
if |am already in the devil's jaws, if | can take hold of it, | 
must come out again, and remain where the word 
remains. Therefore he says: You must not wait for any 
other than that which we have preached. 

Thus St. Paul also speaks to the Romans, Cap. 1, 
16: "| am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power 
of God that saves. 





makes all who believe in it." The word is a divine and 
eternal power. For though the voice or speech soon 
vanishes, yet the kernel, that is, the understanding, the 
truth, which is written in the voice, remains. As when | 
put a cup to my mouth with wine in it, | drink the wine into 
it, but do not push the cup down my throat with it. So also 
is the word that the voice brings: it falls into the heart and 
comes to life, yet the voice remains outside and passes 
away. Therefore it is a divine power, yes, it is God 
himself. For thus he speaks to Moses, Ex. 4, 12: "I will 
be in your mouth"; and Ps. 81, 11: "Open your mouth 
wide", preach confidently, speak out until hungry, "I will 
fill you", | will speak enough there presently. Also John 
14:6 says Christ: "| am the way, the truth and the life", 
whoever clings to this is born of God. So also the seed 
is God Himself. All this is to teach us how not to be 
helped by works. Even though the word is small and 
seems to be nothing, because it comes out of the mouth, 
there is such an overwhelming power in it that it makes 
those who cling to it children of God, John 1:12. Our 
salvation stands on such high ground. 

This is the first chapter of this epistle, in which you 
see how masterfully St. Peter preaches and acts the 
faith; from this you can see that this epistle is the right 
gospel. Now follows the other chapter, which will teach 
us how we should conduct ourselves in works toward our 
neighbor. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. Put away therefore all malice, and all deceit, 
and hypocrisy, and envy, and all speaking evil. 
There he begins to instruct what the works and fruits of 
a Christian life should be. For we have often enough said 
how a Christian life consists of two things: faith toward 
God and love toward one's neighbor; item, that the 
Christian faith is given in such a way that 


But always, because we live, there remain in the flesh 
many evil lusts, for there is no saint who is not in the 
flesh. But what is in the flesh cannot be completely pure. 
Therefore says St. Peter: Be ye therefore armed to 
beware of sins which still cling to you, and to contend 
against them for ever. For the worst enemies we have 
are in our bosom and in the midst of our flesh and blood, 


1166 Eri. 52, 63-66, Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


sleep and live with us, like an evil guest, whom one has 
invited to one's home, and cannot get rid of. 

Therefore, since through faith the Lord Christ is all 
yours, and you have obtained salvation and all his 
goods, let it henceforth be your duty to put away all 
malice, or all that is evil, and all deceit or guile, that is, 
that no one deal unfaithfully and falsely with another; as 
it is said of the world, "The world is full of unfaithfulness," 
which is also true. We Christians, however, are not to 
act thus with unfaithfulness, but sincerely and with a 
loud heart with the people, as against God, badly and 
rightly, so that no one misleads the other in selling, 
buying, or vowing, and the like. 

So also St. Paul says Eph. 4, 25: "Put away lies, and 
speak the truth, every one to his neighbor." Truth is that 
yes is yes and no is no; but hypocrisy is when one 
presents himself differently in outward appearance than 
he means in his heart, because it is important to present 
oneself as one has it in his heart. A Christian should act 
in such a way that he might suffer all men to see and 
know what he thinks in his heart; in such a way that in 
all his conduct and actions he thinks only to praise God 
and to serve his neighbor, and shuns no one, and that 
each one may be found in the bottom of his heart as he 
is looked at, and does not make a mirror fencing to shut 
people's mouths. 

Furthermore, St. Peter also says that one should put 
away envy and after-talk. There he finely hits the 
common vices among the people, so one deals with 
each other. Talking back is almost mean and frivolous, 
and is soon done so that no one notices it. Therefore 
beware of it, and diligently seek to know the fruits of the 
Spirit. 

V. 2. And be eager for the sensible, clean milk, as 
the now born children. 

Then he makes a likeness, saying: You are now 
newborn by the word of God, therefore keep yourselves 
as newborn babes, who have no more than milk. 





1167 


As they seek the breasts and the milk, so also be eager 
for the word, seeking it and desiring it, that you may suck 
the sensible, unadulterated milk. 

These words are again ambiguous, for he does not 
mean bodily milk, nor bodily seeking, as he does not 
speak of a bodily birth, but says of another milk, which is 
sensible, that is, spiritual, which one draws with the soul, 
which the heart must suck. This should be genuine and 
pure, not, as one is wont to sell false goods. There is 
truly much need, and great need, that the milk of the 
newborn and young Christians be pure and not 
adulterated. But the milk is nothing but the gospel, which 
is also the very seed by which we are conceived and 
born, as we have heard above. So it is also the food that 
feeds us when we grow up, is also the armor that we 
may arm ourselves and do evil; yes, it is all with one 
another. But the addition is man's doctrine, that the word 
of God may be counterfeited. Therefore the Holy Spirit 
wants every Christian to see what milk he is sucking, and 
to learn for himself about all doctrines. 

But the breasts that give forth this milk and suckle the 
young children are the preachers in Christendom; as the 
bridegroom says to the bride in the Song of Songs, Cap. 
4, 5: "Thy two breasts are as two young twins of a roe 
deer." They should have a bunch of myrrh hanging 
around them, as the bride says in the Song of Songs, 
Cap. 1, 13: "My friend is a bunch of myrrh hanging 
between my breasts,” that is, one should always preach 
Christ; the bridegroom must be mingled in the middle of 
the breasts, otherwise it is wrong, and the milk is 
falsified, if one does not preach Christ purely. This is how 
it is: when one preaches that Christ died for us and 
saved us from sins, death and hell; that is as sweet as 
milk. But after that one must also preach the cross, that 
one may suffer as he did; this is strong drink and strong 
wine. Therefore, Christians must first be given the 
softest food, that is, milk. For it is not possible to preach 
evil to them, except to preach first of all the cross. 


1168 EU. sz, 66-68. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 2-4. 


1169 


preaching Christ alone, which is not bitter, but is sweet || believe in my heart that Christ has given himself to me 


and fat grace, and you must not yet bear any pain. This 
is the right, sensible, and pure milk. 

And here St. Peter has reached far into the 
Scriptures, as he is quite rich in writings. In the Old 
Testament it is written, 2 Mos. 23, 19. and 5 Mos. 14, 
21.: "You shall not boil the people, because they are at 
their mother's milk. Dear, why did God write this? What 
does he care that a kid should not be killed because it is 
still sucking milk? Therefore, he wants to mean that St. 
Peter teaches here, and so much is said: "Preach 
carefully to the young and weak Christians; let them feed 
well and grow fat in the knowledge of Christ. Do not load 
them with strong teaching, for they are still too young. 
But after that, when they become strong, let them be 
slaughtered and sacrificed on the cross. Thus we read 
also Deut. 24:5: If aman had lately taken a wife, he must 
not go to war the first year, lest he be slain, but be merry 
at home with his wife. This is all to the effect that those 
who are still young Christians should be allowed their 
time, and should be treated carefully. When they have 
grown up, God leads them to the holy cross and lets 
them die like the other Christians; there the little goat is 
slaughtered. Now follows further: 


V. 2. 3. so that by the same you may be made 
mehmet, if you have been frightened otherwise, that 
the Lord is kind. 


It is not enough to hear the gospel once, we must 
always press on to increase; after that faith is strong, 
after that each one must be provided and fed. But this is 
not said to those who have not heard the gospel; they 
know neither milk nor wine. Therefore he adds, "If ye 
have tasted otherwise, that the Lord is good:" as if to 
say, To him that hath not tasted it, it is not to his heart, it 
is not sweet: but to them that have tasted it, they always 
handle the meat and the word, to them it is right and 
sweet. 

But that means tasted, if | have to work with the 


and has become my own, and my sin and misfortune are 
his, and now his life is mine. If such things go to the 
heart, they are tasty. For how can | not have joy and 
delight from it? | am so happy when a good friend gives 
me a hundred guilders. But he who does not take it to 
heart cannot rejoice in 1) anything. But those taste it best 
who are in mortal distress or who are oppressed by an 
evil conscience; hunger is a good cook, as they say, who 
makes this 2) food taste good. The heart and conscience 
can hear nothing more sweet, when it feels its misery, it 
is eager for it, and smells the roast far away, and cannot 
be satisfied. So dear Mary sings in the Magnificat: "He 
fills the hungry with good things." But those stubborn 
people who live in their own holiness, build on their 
works, and do not feel their sin and misfortune, they do 
not taste it. He that sitteth at the table, and is hungry, 
savoureth all things well: but he that is full before, 
savoureth nothing, but hath abhorrence even of the very 
best of meat. Therefore the apostle says: "If you have 
tasted otherwise, that the Lord is good," as if he should 
say: "If you have not tasted, | preach in vain. He goes on 
to say: 


V.4 To whom you have come as to the living stone. 


Here he goes back to the scriptures and touches the 
prophet Isaiah, Cap. 28, 14-16, where he says: "Hear 
now the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule over this 
people who are at Jerusalem. For ye say, We have made 
a covenant with death, and a covenant with hell: if a flood 
come, it shall not overtake us; for we have made 
ourselves a false refuge and a deceitful screen. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, | lay in Zion 
a foundation stone, a touchstone, a _ precious 
cornerstone, well established. He that believeth shall not 
be dismayed. "2c. St. Peter used this saying here, and it 
is also one of the main sayings in Scripture. For Christ is

1171 





This precious cornerstone, which God Himself laid, upon 
which both Jews and Gentiles must be built by faith, lest 
they otherwise despair, perish and die in their sins. 

Just as builders lay the foundation stone when it is 
certain and firm that it can support the whole building: 
God Himself has laid Christ as a foundation stone, so 
that it will stand; and this is so that all who build on Him, 
that is, are called by the Gospel, accept it and believe 
that they will be justified and saved through Christ, and 
be sure that they will remain safe and sound against all 
calamities, be they sin, death, or the devil; but those who 
do not build on Him must be lost and condemned, for 
there is briefly no help or counsel for them. He is also a 
touchstone, which is well proven, and has been tempted 
in every way through suffering and the cross, so that he 
can have compassion and help those who are tempted, 
just as all those who are built on him encounter this, for 
they must be conformed to his image, Rom. 8:29. He is 
also a precious cornerstone. It is precious in the hearts 
of believers in Christ and before God; but before the 
world it is despised and rejected by the builders, that is, 
the best in the world, who teach and govern others, as 
St. Peter will soon say. But a cornerstone the prophet 
calls him, because he has gathered together the two 1) 
walls, that is, peoples, Jews and Gentiles, and has made 
of them one people and church 2c. So Christ, the living 
stone, carries the whole structure and joins it together, 
so that it grows into a living temple in the Lord, so that all 
the gates of hell cannot overthrow it. For he that is built 
upon this foundation stone, that is, believeth, as the 
prophet himself clearly interpreteth, shall not be afraid. 
More about this hereafter. 


He who is rejected by men, but is chosen by God 
and is delicious. 

But here he cites a saying from the 118th Psalm, v. 
22 f.: "The stone that the builders rejected has become 
the cornerstone. The

has come from the Lord and is a miracle before our 
eyes"; which saying Christ also indicates Matth. 21, 42; 
item. St. Peter Apost. 4:11, where he says: "This is the 
stone rejected by you builders, which has become the 
cornerstone"; as if St. Peter should say: "You are 
builders; God has commanded you his house, that is, his 
people, that you should build it, improve it, and teach the 
way to salvation; has ordained your priesthood, Aaron, 
whose descendants you are, himself, has commanded 
you the law, the Scriptures, and the ministry. And he 
hath made you builders, that ye should take heed to the 
stone which he himself hath laid, and build yourselves 
and your people thereon, that is, receive him, and direct 
the people unto him as the right Lord and Saviour, that 
whosoever believeth in him should not be put to shame 
2c. What are you doing? Not only have you not accepted 
him, but you have most shamefully and disgracefully 
rejected him, even condemning him to death as a 
blasphemer, deceiver and rebel, and putting him on the 
cross 2c., so that among you builders and your disciples 
he is despised and rejected, but with God he is chosen 
and precious, who has made him the cornerstone to 
support the whole building and to bind up the two walls, 
so that all who are built on him by faith shall not be 
dismayed; therefore, because you reject him, God has 
rejected you again and has adopted the Gentiles as his 
people 2c. In this way Christ Himself introduces this 
saying, Matth. 21, 42. 2c. 


V. 5 And you also, as living stones, build 
yourselves into a spiritual house. 


How can we build ourselves? Through the gospel and 
preaching. The builders are the preachers. The 
Christians who hear the gospel and believe are the living 
stones that are built and set on the cornerstone; they put 
their trust in it, so that their hearts will stand and rest on 
it. 2) They are the ones who are to keep the shape of the 
stone. It is therefore fitting that they should keep the form 
which this stone has; for if | am laid upon it by faith, | 
must also follow its example, do the work and conduct 
myself as it did, and each one with me.

Adam. For the unreasonable being in flesh and blood 
must be killed with the gospel, so we let ourselves be 
sacrificed and strangled on the cross. There the right 
priesthood goes in the swing, that we sacrifice to God 
the evil rogue, the lazy old donkey. For in the end, 
everything that we have from the old Adam must be put 
away, as we heard in the first chapter above. This is the 
only sacrifice that is pleasing and acceptable to God. 
From this you can see where our fools and blind leaders 
have led us with their illusions, who have neither 
understood what the right priesthood is, nor what 
sacrifices we should offer to God. 

Now you may say: If it is true that we are all priests 
and should preach, what kind of being will that be? Shall 
there be no difference among the people, and shall the 
women also be priests? Answer: In the New Testament, 
1) there should be no priests bearing plates; not because 
it is evil of him, but because there should be no 
difference between those who have been called priests 
and the common Christian man, which faith cannot 
suffer, so that those who are now called priests should 
all be laymen like the others, and only some of them who 
are competent should be chosen by the congregation for 
the office of preaching. So there is a difference outwardly 
of the office to which one is called by the congregation, 
but before God there is no difference; for the fact that 
some are preferred from among the multitude is because 
they lead and carry out the office which they all have, 
instead of the congregation. For, as has been said, all 
Christians are to sacrifice, pray, and proclaim and 
confess God's grace in Christ. Therefore none of them 
should appear and preach in the congregation, but one 
must be chosen from among the multitude and set up, to 
be set down again if he would be unrighteous. For St. 
Paul teaches 1 Tim. 3, 2. and Tit. 1, 6.: Such persons 
should be blameless 2c. 

Therefore, the pope has invented his own priesthood 
against God's word, and has lied shamefully and 
unchristianly about it, that the holy

Wittenberg.

u‘> spiritual, who live in such a priesthood. Rather, 
outwardly smearing and shaving plates does not make 
one holy and spiritual; otherwise God would have left it 
at the Levitical priesthood, which he himself had 
established. Christ, the eternal priest, must himself 
stand up for us, die on the cross, and shed his blood, 
thereby purifying us. Such a doctrine and confession the 
wretched pope destroyed with his priesthood, and 
brought it about that there was as great a difference 
among us Christians as there is between us and the 
Turks. If you want to look at the Christians, you must 
make no distinction among them, not say: This is a man 
or a woman, a servant or a master, old or young, but as 
St. Paul says Gal. 3, 28: "You are all one in Christ JEsu. 
Therefore they are also all priests, shall proclaim all 
God's miracles, each one in the house to his own; those 
who have the command, in the church; shall all pray, 
offer praise to God. For, as | have said, no one shall 
teach in the church unless he is called to do so 2c. 

This is now the right priesthood, which stands in the 
three pieces, as we have heard, that one offers spiritual 
sacrifices, and prays and preaches for all needs. 
Whoever then believes in Christ, that he is cleansed 
from all sins by his blood, is a priest, and is obliged to 
proclaim such unspeakable grace and love of God, 
shown to us in Christ; item, that he prays and carries the 
holy cross, by which the old Adam is killed, and offers 
thanks to God. Therefore, we are not to be deceived by 
the monkey business of the papists, if they alone want 
to be priests and spiritual persons, when they have no 
other office than that they carry plates and are smeared. 
By such a jugglery, as said, we are not ordained priests; 
it must be done by another ordaining bishop, of whom it 
is written [Ps. 110, 4]: "The Lord has sworn, and will not 
repent: You are a priest forever" 2c. 


Those who are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ. 


Since Christ is the cornerstone upon which we are 
set, what we want to do against God must be done 
through Him alone, as we

1177 





have heard enough above. For God would not see my 
good works and cross, if | were to torture myself to 
death; but he sees Christ, through whom my works are 
valid before God, which otherwise would not be worth a 
straw. Therefore, the Christian calls Christ a precious 
cornerstone, who communicates his virtue to all who are 
built on him through faith. Thus St. Peter teaches us in 
the saying, how Christ is the living stone, what Christ is; 
and is a fine similitude, from which it is easy to 
understand how one should believe in Christ. So now 
follows: 


V. 6. Therefore it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion 
a chosen and precious cornerstone, and whosoever 
believeth in him shall not be put to shame. 


| have said before that St. Peter lards his epistle well 
and keeps it with scriptures; as all preachers should do, 
so that their foundation stands entirely on God's word. 
Thus, he lists here four or five sayings in succession. 
The first he took from the prophet Isaiah from word to 
word, that Christ is a precious cornerstone and 
foundation stone; and is the very saying that we have 
now acted upon and transfigured in some measure. It is 
a right main saying of the doctrine of faith, which should 
be laid as a foundation if someone wants to preach ina 
place where Christ was not preached before. For it must 
be begun from this that Christ is the stone on which faith 
is to be built and to stand. 

But that the prophet does not speak of a physical 
stone in that place is proven by the fact that it follows: 
"He that believeth on him shall not be put to shame." If | 
am to believe in him, it must be a spiritual stone; for how 
can | believe in a physical stone or wood? For this he 
must truly be God, since God has forbidden in the first 
commandment that one should believe in no thing but 
him alone. Since the stone has been laid as the 
foundation for trusting in it, it must be God Himself. 
Again, it cannot be God alone, but must also be man at 
the same time, so that it must be part of the construction 
and not part of it alone, 





but also the head. Now when one builds, one stone must 
be like another, so that each has its own kind, nature and 
form. Therefore, because we are built upon Christ, he 
must be like us, and of the same nature as the other 
stones that lie upon him, that is, a true man, as we all 
are. So the Scripture expresses with simple and bad 
words such a great thing, namely the whole sum of our 
faith, and comprehends in such short sayings more than 
no man can express. 

| have also said what the building is, namely, faith, by 
which we are placed on Christ, and put our trust in the 
stone, and so become like it; and that this must happen 
so that the building fits together. For the other stones 
must be laid and aligned after the stone. This then is 
love, the fruit of faith. 

But why does the prophet call him a foundation 
stone? Because he cannot build a structure unless a 
stone is first laid as a foundation. For the other stones of 
the building cannot stand without standing on the 
foundation stone. So we must all stand on Christ and 
recognize him as a foundation stone. Therefore we may 
not boast that the stone must take anything from us, but 
we must receive benefit from it alone. For we do not bear 
it, but it bears us, and on it rests sin, death, hell, and all 
that we have; so that all this and what offends us cannot 
harm us if we are set on the foundation. For if we 
therefore abide on him, and rely on him, we must abide 
where he is, even as the natural stones must rely on their 
foundation. 

About this, the prophet also calls him a cornerstone. 
The Holy Spirit has his way of speaking much in short 
words. Christ is a cornerstone because he brought 
together the Gentiles and the Jews, who were deadly 
enemies among themselves, and thus the Christian 
church was gathered from both people; St. Paul writes 
much about this. The Jews boasted that they were God's 
people, in whom alone God had entrusted His word, and 
therefore despised the Gentiles. But now Chri- 


1178 eri, 82, 77-80. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


stus came, took away the glory of the Jews, and also 
claimed us Gentiles, and thus made us both one through 
one faith, and acted with us in such a way that we both 
must confess that we have nothing of our own, but are 
all sinners, and must alone wait for righteousness and 
salvation from him, and that we Gentiles also believe 
that Christ has come to help us, as well as the Jews. 
Therefore he is the cornerstone that joins two walls 
together, Jews and Gentiles, so that they become one 
building and one house, of which St. Paul also writes 
Eph. 2:20 ff. 

Now the prophet thus concludes, "He that believeth 
on him shall not be put to shame." Since the Holy Spirit 
says that those who believe in Christ will not be put to 
shame, he gives us to understand what he has in mind, 
namely, that he has already let the judgment go, and 
has decided that all the world must be put to shame and 
disgraced; yet he wants to draw some out of the heap, 
so that no one may escape disgrace except the one who 
believes in Christ. Thus Christ himself lays it down from 
Marci in the last: "He that believeth and is baptized shall 
be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned"; 
with which words he also touches the prophet here. 
Therefore St. Peter has said in the first chapter that the 
prophets searched the time and searched for salvation, 
and prophesied of the future grace beforehand. So now 
Christ is to be preached, that he is the one who has 
delivered us from this disgrace in which we have all 
been. 

Now let him who will, stand up and praise free will, 
and defend the powers of man. If you want to overthrow 
all the works and teachings of man and what comes 
from man, then you have had enough of this saying 
alone, which overthrows everything so that it must fall 
like the dry leaves from the tree. For it is decided: What 
is not on the stone is already lost; he will not suffer you 
to build anything with works. The Holy Spirit and the 
divine majesty speak so plainly that no one pays 
attention, but with such force that all things are cast 
down. Who then will act against it, or who will not be 
frightened by it? Therefore, God wants us to 


1179 


to despair of us altogether, and to take comfort and 
comfort in the goods which he has, and to build on the 
foundation which no creature can overthrow, that no one 
may rely on his own piety, but on Christ's righteousness, 
and all that Christ has. But what does it mean to rely on 
his righteousness? Nothing else, but to despair of 
myself, and to think that my righteousness, my truth, 
must all fail, and to trust in his righteousness, his truth, 
his life, and all the goods that he has, to endure forever. 
There lies the foundation, since | stand on it. What does 
not stand on this foundation, all will have to fall. But he 
that trusteth on it shall not be put to shame, and shall 
abide, that no violence shall hurt him. Therefore Christ 
shall not be a stone alone, but God will also lay him as 
a foundation; of this we shall take comfort. God has said 
that he will not be able to lie. 

Now this stone does not serve itself, but can be 
kicked and buried in the ground so that it is not seen, 
and the other stones lie on it and can be seen; therefore 
it is given to us, that we should take from it and rely on 
it, and believe what it has, that it is all ours, what it can 
do, that it has benefited us, so that | may say: This is my 
own good and treasure, of which my conscience can be 
comforted. Now St. Peter speaks further: 


V. 7, 8: Now to you who believe it is precious, but 
to unbelievers the stone that the builders rejected 
and made into the cornerstone is a stumbling block 
and a rock of offense. 


This stone, says St. Peter, is to some chosen and 
precious; it is also to some a stone to stumble against 
and a rock of trouble, Isa. 8:14. How does this work? 
Scripture speaks of two kinds of people: There are some 
who believe in Christ, and there are many who do not 
believe in him. To them that believe he is precious: for if 
| put my trust and comfort in him, | shall be glad in my 
heart, because | have comfort in him, that | shall not be 
put to shame. Therefore he says, "He is precious to you 
who believe, that is, who think much of him. 


1180 en, 58, 80-82. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 2, 7. 8. 


For though he himself is good and precious, yet he is of 
no use to me, nor does he help me; for | believe that he, 
as the right living foundation stone, sustains me, so that 
| cannot be lost. So then he is delicious to us who believe 
in him, that he gives us many precious things, like a 
precious stone that does not keep its virtue with it, but 
breaks out and gives all its strength from itself, so that | 
have all that he is. 

The unbelievers, however, do not consider him to be 
such a chosen, precious stone, but reject him, and 
stumble at him; therefore he is not comforting to them, 
but harmful and annoying, although otherwise he is 
chosen in himself and is delicious and comforting to the 
believers. These are not only the gross, public sinners, 
but rather the great saints, as in the time of Christ there 
were the Pharisees, scribes, 2c., who held firmly above 
the law, and practiced it with all seriousness, thinking 
that they thereby intended to attain salvation; and in our 
times the works saints, who rely on their free will, on their 
works and piety: they must bump against this stone and 
run up against it. God then makes a judgment that those 
who sit on this stone and allow themselves to be built 
upon it come to righteousness through faith alone, 
without works; but those do not come to it, because they 
want to come to it through their own piety, as St. Paul 
says Rom. 9, 31. 

Therefore the stone, says St. Peter, which the 
builders rejected and became the cornerstone, is to the 
unbelievers a stone of offence and a rock of trouble; and 
there he interlaces the Scripture, but draws on the 
saying which he touched above, from the 118th Psalm, 
v. 22: "The stone which the builders rejected has 
become the cornerstone." Who the builders are, is said 
above, namely, those who teach the law and want to 
make people godly by works; they come over with Christ 
as winter and summer. Therefore, the preachers of 
works and teachers of the law must reject this stone. 
St. Peter always introduces one saying after another 
from the Scriptures. Is. 8, 13. is written: "Sanctify the 
LORD of hosts. Let him be your fear and your dread, so 
that 





1181 


He will be a sanctification, but a stone of stumbling and 
a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel" 2c.; the 
prophet thus wants to say: The Lord shall be a 
sanctification for you, that is, he shall be sanctified in 
your hearts; you must have no other sanctification, 
neither this nor that, except that you believe in him. But 
to those who do not believe, he will be a stone against 
which they will stumble and be angry. Who then are the 
unbelievers? Not only the godless Gentiles, but also the 
people of Israel and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who 
are God's people and circumcised, and have the Law of 
Moses and keep it externally 2c. 

But what is the annoyance and tarnishing or 
bumping? This is it: When one preaches Christ, and thus 
says: Behold, this stone is laid for a foundation, that thou 
shouldest despair and despair of thyself altogether, and 
think thy works and own godliness vain, and that thou 
canst not be saved by the works of the law, 2c. and that 
thou shouldest rely on him alone, and believe that 
Christ's righteousness is thy righteousness; when they 
hear this, they recoil, and are offended and angry, and 
say: How can you say that the law of Moses, the 
beautiful worship that God Himself established, 
circumcision is nothing? item, as our adversaries are 
wont to say, that virginity and mass-keeping and such 
good works are nothing? That is the devil's way of 
talking. For they cannot judge themselves that their 
conduct should not be good, thinking that it is well done 
in the sight of God, and they also bring scriptural sayings 
to bear on it, and say that one should do good works. 
Right, but such good works should be done, which God 
has commanded, but if they are already done in the best 
way, we cannot be justified or saved by them, much less 
by works of our own choosing without God's command 
2c. So they raise their voices and cry: Heretic, heretic! 
Fire, fire! Therefore they cannot stand the stone, and 
want to overturn it; so they clash against each other, so 
that they must be crushed against this stone, as Christ 
says Matth. 21, 42: "Have you not read in the Scriptures: 
The stone which the builders rejected has become the 
cornerstone?" (follows, v. 44.:) "And whosoever shall fall 
upon this stone shall be dashed to pieces; upon which 


1182 Eri. 52, 82-84. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. 


1183 


Peter. 





but it falls, it will crush him." Therefore do as you will, 
there is no shame in the stone; it is laid and will remain. 
Whoever now wants to run up against it and rub against 
it will have to break. 

Now this is the offence and the vexation of which the 
Scriptures speak much. So the Jews are still striking at 
the stone today, and there is no end to it until the last 
day; then this stone will fall on all unbelievers and crush 
them. Therefore, though Christ is such a chosen and 
precious stone, yet he must be called a stone of offense 
and stumbling, through no fault of his own. As the Jews 
did, so do our adversaries now. They boasted in God's 
name that they were God's people, so it was impossible 
that they should err; 2c. So it is also now that they deny 
Christ under Christ and the church's name, and reject 
the precious stone. Cause: They are to let go of their 
wisdom, righteousness, holiness 2c.; this they will not 
and cannot do; before they reject this chosen, precious 
stone. But it remains unthrown, but they must go to the 
ground over it and go to the devil; nothing else will come 
of it. Follow on: 


Those who take offense at the word and do not 
believe in it, from which they are set. 


Then hear thou what the cause is, that the word and 
preaching of Christ shall not enter into them, neither 
taste that we must be built upon him, or be lost with us. 
Therefore, when they hear: By the works of the law no 
man can be justified before God; vowing and keeping 
chastity, poverty, obedience, does not appease God's 
wrath, but believing in Christ 2c., they do not believe 
such preaching of grace, indeed, they resent and are 
offended by it. Therefore St. Paul also calls the gospel 
an angry word from the cross, which those who are lost 
consider to be a loud foolishness. "We preach," he says, 
"Christ crucified, a vexation to the Jews and a 
foolishness to the Greeks; but to those who are called, 
both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ, divine power 
and divine wisdom," 1 Cor. 1:23 ff. 





V. 9. But you are the chosen generation, the royal 
priesthood, the holy nation, the people of ownership. 


Then he gives the Christians a righteous title, and 
has taken the saying from Moses, Deut. 7, 6. where he 
says to the Jews: "You are a holy people to God, your 
Lord; God, your Lord, has chosen you as a people of 
ownership from all the peoples that are on earth. And 
Ex. 19:5 f. he saith, "If ye will obey my voice, and keep 
my covenant, then ye shall be my possession before all 
nations, and shall be unto me a priestly kingdom, and a 
holy nation." There you see what St. Peter is talking 
about. As | said before, so | still say that one should pay 
attention and be accustomed to how the Scriptures 
speak of priests; let no one worry about whom people 
call priests; let them call everyone what they want, you 
stay with the true word of God; what that same priest is 
called, you call after him, so you do not err. We will let it 
happen that those who are ordained by bishops and 
pope call themselves priests, but so far that they do not 
call themselves God's priests; for they cannot find a 
word of it for themselves from the Scriptures. 

But if they come with this saying of St. Peter, and 
pretend that he speaks of them, ask them to whom St. 
Peter speaks these words, they will have to stand with 
shame. For it is ever clear and public that he speaks to 
the whole multitude, to all Christians, in that he says: 
"You are the chosen generation" 2c.; for he has spoken 
of no one so far, except of those who are laid on the 
stone and believe; therefore it must follow that whoever 
does not believe is not a priest. 

Yes, they say, one must interpret the words 1) as the 
holy fathers have interpreted them; so you say: Let the 
fathers and teachers, whoever they are, interpret as they 
wish; so St. Peter tells me, he has greater testimony 
from God than those; in addition, he is also older, 
therefore | will keep it with him. So the saying is not 
allowed to be a gloss, because it speaks of those who 
believe with expressed words. 


1) "So" is in the first edit, but is missing in the Wittenberg. 


1184 En. 84-86. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 2, 9. 


1185 





Now the Scriptures call those faithful who know Christ as 
their Lord and Savior, and certainly hope to be saved, 
not by works, hard living and merit, but by his death and 
resurrection, as has been sufficiently said above. 
Therefore we will gladly grant them that they may call 
themselves so, for we do not ask how they will be 
reproached; but the dispute is whether they are called 
priests in the Scriptures, and whether God calls them so. 
Some can be drawn from the congregation to serve as 
ministers, and they are appointed to preach in the 
congregation and to administer the sacraments; but all 
who believe in Christ are priests before God; for since 
they are placed on the stone, which is the true, eternal 
high priest before God, they also have all that he has. 

Therefore | would very much like that this word 
"priest" would be just as common as that we are called 
Christians, because it is all one thing, priests, baptized, 
Christians. Just as we should not suffer that the smeared 
and corrupted multitude should call themselves 
Christians and baptized alone, so we should not suffer 
that they should want to be priests alone; nor have they 
taken it upon themselves alone. Thus they have also 
snatched the word "church" to themselves alone, so that 
we must accept everything they have decided and 
established, even if it has already been publicly contrary 
to God's word, as articles of faith and hold them to be 
blessed if we lose our souls; but the Scriptures call this 
group the church, if they have the pure word of God and 
the right understanding and use of the sacraments, and 
believe to be saved through Jesus Christ. 2c. Therefore, 
notice this carefully, so that you know how to make a 
distinction between those who are priests before God, 
namely, those who proclaim God's glory and good deeds 
shown to us in Christ, pray, do good and suffer evil, and 
those who want to be called priests because of their 
consecration, plates and long robe; they are priests, as 
Baal's priests were prophets 2c. 

So it is also true that we are all kings. Priests and 
kings are all spiritual names, like Christians, saints, 
church. For just as you are not called a Christian 
because you have much money and goods, but because 
you are built on the stone and believe in Christ: 


So you are not called a priest because you wear a plate 
or a long skirt, but because you have access to the 
Father through Christ, and you may ask in His name and 
be sure that you will be heard. Likewise, you are not a 
king because you wear a crown of gold and have much 
land and people under you, but because through Christ 
you are lord over death, sin, hell, and all creatures. For 
you are as much aking as Christ is a king, if you believe 
in him. Now he is not a worldly king, nor does he wear a 
crown of gold, nor does he ride forth with great pomp 
and 1) many horses; but he is a king above all kings, to 
whom all authority has been given in heaven and earth, 
and, as the Psalm says, all things have been put under 
his feet. As he is a lord, so am | and so are you a lord; 
what he has, | have and you have also; for through him 
we are God's children and heirs, his brothers and fellow 
heirs, Rom. 8:17. 

Just as Christ is not a worldly king (for in the world he 
had no place of his own where he could have laid his 
head), but a spiritual, eternal king, to whom the Father 
gave all things, so that he might save his own from all 
misery and make them righteous and blessed, so also 
those who believe in him are spiritual kings through him, 
partakers of eternal, heavenly goods, which neither 
death nor the devil can take away from them. | say this 
so that you may understand the words priest, king 2c. in 
the Scriptures, not like the world, which knows of no 
other kings than those who wear golden crowns, have 
lands and people under them, who may also be wicked, 
godless people, as they also commonly are. They are 
glorious, powerful, rich and proud in the eyes of the 
world, but when death comes, their power and honor are 
over. But with the kings, of whom St. Peter says here, it 
is the same the other way round; on earth they are 
commonly poor, miserable, afflicted and despised 
people 2c.; but before God the richest and most glorious, 
who have little or nothing, and yet have everything; who 
are poor, and yet many

1186 a. [s, s8-ss. Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1187 





make us rich. Whoever does not recognize Christ and 
does not know what God has given us through Him, 
does not understand anything about it. 

Therefore, when St. Peter says here: You are the 
royal priesthood, it is just as much as if he said: You are 
Christians. If you want to know what title, authority and 
prize the Christians have, here it is, that they are kings 
and priests, and the chosen people. Now follows what 
they are ordained for, what their priesthood is, and how 
they are to exercise it. 


That you may proclaim the virtues of Him who 
called you from darkness to His marvelous light. 


This belongs to a priest, that he is God's messenger 
and has orders from God to proclaim His word. Virtue 
(says St. Peter), that is, the miraculous work that God 
has demonstrated in you, that He has brought you from 
darkness to His marvelous light, you are to preach, 
which is the highest work of your priestly office; And so 
your preaching shall be done, that one may proclaim to 
another the great deeds of God, how you have been 
redeemed from sin, hell and death and all misfortune 
through Christ, whom he sent as Savior of the world, and 
have been called to eternal life; in the same way you 
shall also teach other people, so that they also come to 
such light. For all things are to be directed to this end, 
that ye may know what God hath done for you, and let it 
be your noblest work to proclaim it publicly, and to call 
every man to the light whereunto ye are called. Where 
you see people who do not know this, you are to instruct 
them and also teach them as you have learned, namely, 
how one must not come from darkness to light and be 
saved by human virtue and strength, but by God's virtue 
and strength. 

Here you see that St. Peter clearly says that there is 
only one light, and concludes that all our reason, 
however wise it is, is darkness. For although reason can 
count one, two, three, and also see what is black or 
white, large or small, and judge other external things, it 
cannot see what faith is. It is so blind that, even if all men 
can see their intelligence, it cannot see what faith is. 





If they were to come together, they would not be able to 
understand a single letter of divine wisdom. Therefore, 
here St. Peter speaks of another light, which is 
wonderful, and says freely to all of us, no one excluded, 
that we are all in darkness and blindness, and would also 
have to remain in it forever, if God did not call us to His 
wonderful light. 

This is also taught to us by experience. For when it is 
preached that we cannot come before God by works, but 
must have a mediator who may come before God and 
reconcile us to Him, reason must confess that it knew 
nothing of this. If it is to understand this, it must have a 
different light and knowledge and draw it from the word 
of the Gospel. Therefore, what is not God's word and 
faith is all darkness. For reason gropes like a blind man, 
always falling from one to the other, and does not know 
what it is doing. But if one says this to the scholars and 
wise men of the world, they do not want to hear it and 
start to scream and rave against it. Therefore St. Peter 
is truly a bold apostle, that he may call darkness, which 
all the world calls light. 

So we see that the first and most noble office that we 
Christians should do is to proclaim the virtues of God. 
What then are the virtues and great deeds that God has 
shown us? They are, as we have often said, that Christ 
by God's power has swallowed up death, destroyed hell, 
strangled sin, and set us on the path to eternal life; these 
are such great virtues that no man is able to comprehend 
them, let alone do them. Therefore it is a wretched and 
wrong thing that we Christians are preached the doctrine 
of man; we should be preached of such divine power, 
which overcomes the devil, sin and death. 

And here St. Peter has once again stirred up many 
sayings, as he then through and through almost always 
leads one saying into the other. For all the prophets say 
that God's name and glory, and his arm or power should 
be honored and praised, and that he should do such a 
work that the whole world should sing and say about it. 
The prophets are of this 


1188 En. 52, 8g-gi. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 9-11. 


1189 





All places are full; St. Peter points to all of them. They 
have also spoken much about light and darkness, that we 
must be enlightened with God's light; so that they also 
indicate that all human reason is darkness. St. Peter 
continues: 


V.10. You were not a people before, but now you 
are God's people, and you were not in grace before, 
but now you are in grace. 


This saying is expressed in the prophet Hosea at 2, 
v. 23. St. Paul also referred to it in Romans at 9, v. 25: "I 
will call this my people, which was not my people, and my 
love, which was not love". All this is based on the fact that 
God Almighty specially chose the people of Israel and 
gave them great and mighty honor, and gave them many 
prophets, and also did many miraculous works with them, 
so that He would make Christ, His only begotten Son, 
man out of the people; for the Son's sake it all happened; 
that is why they are called God's people in the Scriptures. 
But the prophets went on to say that this promise should 
break out and also affect the Gentiles. That is why St. 
Peter says: "You are God's people, who were not God's 
people in the past. From this it is clear that he wrote this 
epistle to the Gentiles, not to the Jews; thus he wants to 
indicate that the prophet's saying is now fulfilled, that they 
are a holy people who have property, priesthood and 
kingdom and everything that Christ has, if they believe. 
So now follows in Petro: 


V. 11. Dear brethren, I exhort you as strangers 
and pilgrims, 1) abstain from the fleshly lusts which 
war against the soul. 

St. Peter here speaks a little differently than St. Paul, 
who would not speak as we will hear; for every apostle 
has his own way of speaking, as does every prophet. So 
far he has laid the right foundation of the Christian faith, 
and taught how through Christ they are children of grace, 
God's people and heirs. 


1) Wittenberger: "Bilgerin" from the Latin xereZrinus. 


He sets them in the hope of eternal blessedness and 
builds them on him as the chosen, precious stone, so 
that they will be safe from all misfortune, who just before 
lived as unbelieving pagans in error and _ idolatry, 
knowing nothing about Christ and salvation 2c. Now he 
continues, first of all admonishing them and all Christians 
in general to abstain as aliens and pilgrims from fleshly 
lusts, not to be like this world 2c.; then how each one, in 
whatever station, high or low, he may be, should conduct 
himself; as if to say: You have now heard the gospel, 
have been baptized, and know what Christ has 
purchased for you, namely grace and forgiveness of sins, 
righteousness, life and salvation. Now sin is forgiven, but 
it has not yet been swept out of you, killed and buried. 
Since you have been called to be God's chosen, holy 
people, kings and priests in His kingdom, make every 
effort to fulfill your calling, to consider yourselves guests 
and pilgrims on earth, to turn your faces and hearts to 
the right fatherland, in which you are citizens 2c.Not that 
they should not be aware of the nature of this world at 
all, for he instructs all classes how they should conduct 
themselves in their profession, but that they should know 
that they are citizens in heaven, but here on earth they 
are pilgrims and guests who lie in a foreign inn, since 
they do not belong to their home, therefore they should 
have a hearty desire for their right dwelling place 2c. 

Now this is the right way to preach, that first of all faith 
should be described, what it does, and what its nature 
and power are, namely, that it brings us everything that 
is necessary for our piety and salvation, in sum, that 
through it we have everything that God has. Now that 
God has come with us, has given us all that is His, and 
has become our own, so that we have all goods and 
sufficiency through faith, what shall we do? shall we walk 
idly? It would be best for us to die, then we would have it 
all. But because we live here, we should also do the 
same to our neighbor, and give ourselves to him as God 
has given Himself to us. Thus faith makes us blessed, 
but love 


1190 en.52, 9-93. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1191 








serves the neighbor; for where faith is, it does not 
celebrate, but is active through love, Gal. 5, 6. Thus faith 
takes from God, but love gives to the neighbor. That is 
the Christian life in a nutshell. One can also preach a lot 
about it, and then go on to describe it, as St. Peter does 
here. 

This, then, is the apostle's opinion when he says: 
"Dear brethren, | exhort you as strangers and pilgrims." 
Forasmuch then as ye are one with Christ, and his goods 
are yours, and your loss is his loss, and he taketh unto 
himself all that ye have: therefore ye ought to follow him, 
and so keep yourselves, as though ye were no more 
citizens of the world: for your goods are not on earth, but 
in heaven; and though ye have lost all temporal goods, 
yet have ye Christ, who is far more and better than 
heaven and earth. On the other hand, the devil is a 
prince and lord of this world, and reigns mightily in it over 
its citizens, who are those who do not believe in Christ 
and live according to the lusts of the flesh 2c. But 
because ye are pilgrims in the world, do even as a 
stranger in an inn, which hath not his goods there, but 
taketh only meat, and giveth his money for it, and 
thinketh only how he may speedily come home. For it is 
only a passage here, since we cannot stay, but must 
travel on. Therefore we should have no more need of 
worldly goods, but to cover ourselves with them and fill 
ourselves with them, and so be gone. We are citizens in 
heaven, pilgrims and guests on earth. Therefore we 
have no lasting city here, but we seek the city that is to 
come, Hebr. 13:14. 


Abstain from fleshly lusts, which fight against the 
soul. 


| do not want to discuss here whether St. Peter is 
talking about external fornication, or how St. Paul uses 
to talk, who calls everything carnal, which a man does 
without faith, who is in the body and carnal life. But | think 
that St. Peter has a slightly different way, nor do | think 
that he takes the word soul, like St. Paul, for the spirit; 
but St. Peter (as | think) has given himself further into the 
common Greek language than St. Paul. But there is no 
power in it, one understands it from all kinds of 
pleasures, or only from 





of carnal desire or fornication. But this is what he wants 
to indicate here, that no saint on earth can be completely 
perfect and pure. 

The high schools have applied the saying to sinners 
alone, as if the saints no longer had and felt any evil 
desire. As they understand the Scriptures, so they 
interpret them. But whoever wants to study the 
Scriptures correctly must understand a difference, for it 
sometimes speaks of the saints as if they were 
completely pure; on the other hand, it also speaks of 
them as if they still have an evil desire and always bite 
themselves with their sins. They cannot be judged by 
these two things. Therefore let it be understood that 
Christians are divided into two parts: the inward being, 
which is faith, and the outward being, which is the flesh. 
Now if you look at a Christian by faith, he is pure and 
completely clean, because the word of God has nothing 
unclean about him. When this comes into a heart that is 
attached to it, it also makes it completely pure. 
Therefore, in faith all things are perfect. Accordingly, we 
are kings and priests and God's people, as stated above. 
But because we still live on earth and still wear the old 
sackcloth on our necks, which still has sin, we still feel 
evil inclinations, as impatience, anger, fear of death, 2c. 
These are all still infirmities of the old man, because faith 
is not yet as it should be, does not have complete power 
over the flesh. 

You can understand this from the parable in the 
Gospel, Luc. 10, 30. ff., about the man who went down 
from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among the murderers, 
who beat him and left him half-dead, whom the 
Samaritan then took up and bandaged his wounds, 
nursed him and kept him waiting. You see that this man, 
because he is now being cared for, is now never deathly 
ill and is sure of life, but he is not whole. Life is there, but 
his health is not yet complete; he is still under the care 
of physicians and must still be healed. So we also have 
the Lord Christ complete, and are assured of eternal life; 
but we do not have complete health, there still remains 
something in the flesh of the old Adam. This is also 
shown in the parable of Matthew 13, 


1192 ed. [s, 93-96. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 11. 


1193 





33. ff., where Christ says: "The kingdom of heaven is like 
leaven, which a woman takes, and mixes it under three 
bushels of flour, until it 1) becomes thoroughly 
leavened." When you make a dough from flour, the 
leaven is all in it; but it has not gone all the way through, 
and has not worked its way through; but it lies in the work 
until it is thoroughly leavened, and now no more leaven 
is to be added to it. So you also have what you ought to 
have by faith, so that you may grasp the word of God; 
but it has not completely penetrated, therefore it must 
work until you are completely leavened. In this way you 
shall discern the Scriptures, so that you do not also 
torture them as the papists do. 

Therefore | say: When one reads in the Scriptures 
about saints that they have been perfect, then 
understand that they have been completely pure and 
without sin according to faith. But because the flesh was 
still there, it could not have been completely pure. 
Therefore Christians desire and ask that the body or the 
flesh be put to death, so that they may become 
completely pure. Those who teach otherwise have not 
felt nor tasted this, therefore they speak as they think 
and understand with their reason; for this reason they 
must also fail. The great saints who have written and 
taught much have stumbled here. Origen has not a word 
of it in his books. Jerome did not understand it either. If 
Augustine had not had to quarrel with the Pelagians, he 
would not have understood it either. When they speak of 
saints, they exalt them as if they were something 
different and better than other Christians, just as if they 
had not felt the flesh and complained about it, just as we 
do. Therefore St. Peter says here: Ye are now clean 
through faith, and have righteousness wholly: therefore 
henceforth contend with evil lusts. So also Christ says 
John 13:10, "He that is washed must not but wash the 
feet, but is altogether clean," saying that they are 
altogether clean, and yet he would have them wash the 
feet. So also St. Paul teaches Col. 2, 10: "In Christ you 
are perfect"; and yet he admonishes them 


1) i.e. the dough. 





Then in chapter 3, v. 1 f., just like St. Peter here, he says: 
"Since you have been raised with Christ, seek the things 
that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand 
of God. Seek that which is above, not that which is on 
earth." Item, v. 5: "Mortify therefore your members which 
are upon the earth" 2c. 

What does St. Peter mean when he says: "Abstain 
from the lusts that war against the soul"? This is what he 
means: You must not think that it will be all right to play 
and sleep. Because you believe in Christ, sin is forgiven 
you; but it is not yet dead, it still stirs because you are 
alive, for you still have the flesh, which is still senseless 
and raging. Therefore see to it that you do not leave the 
bridle to it, but press it under. It will have to be done by 
force that you conquer and curb the lusts: the greater 
your faith is, the greater will also be the impulses. 
Therefore you must be armed and hardened, and fight 
against them without ceasing with faith and prayer. For 
they will attack you with multitudes and want to take you 
captive. Therefore St. Paul also says Rom. 7, 22. f.: "l 
delight in the law of God according to the inward man; 
but | find another law in my members, which is contrary 
to the law in my mind, and takes me captive in the law of 
sin, which is in my members"; as if he should say: | fight 
against it, yet it will not cease; | would gladly be rid of it, 
but it will not be, my will is of no avail. What shall | do 
then? "| poor, wretched man (he says), who will deliver 
me from the body of this death?" So all the saints cry out. 

But the people who are without faith, the devil leads 
so that they go safely in sins, follow the fleshly lusts, and 
do not beat themselves with it at all. But the others, as 
saints of works and hypocrites, he thinks, | have already 
caught with unbelief; so | will let them go, that they will 
not do gross sin, and will not have great temptation, and 
so will cover them with grief and mischief. On the other 
hand, the believers have enough temptation all the time, 
they have to fight all the time, and those who are without 
faith and spirit do not feel it; therefore they break out, 


1194 en. 62, gs-ss. Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


and follow the evil desire. But as soon as the spirit and 
faith come into the heart, man becomes so weak that he 
thinks he cannot resist the slightest temptation, and sees 
that he is full of sin from the top of his head to the bottom 
of his feet. For before he believed, he went as he 
pleased; but now that the Spirit has come and wants to 
make him clean, the controversy arises, and the devil, 
the flesh and the world oppose faith. All the prophets 
complain about this in the Scriptures. 

Therefore learn to understand this saying of St. 
Peter's, that the conflict does not take place in raw 
sinners, but in believers; and it also gives Christians a 
fine consolation that they do not think, when they feel evil 
desires, that they will soon be condemned because of 
this; but they should not consent to this, but abstain from 
it. Therefore, if you have unbelief, impatience, or other 
evil thoughts, do not despair; only see that you do not let 
them take you captive. Our teachers have tried to advise 
people to torture themselves until they no longer feel sin 
and evil thoughts, until at last many of them have 
become mad and insane. But if you are a Christian, learn 
that you will undoubtedly feel all kinds of impulses and 
evil inclinations in the flesh. For when faith is there, a 
hundred evil thoughts, a hundred more temptations, 
come to thee than before; only see to it that thou be a 
man, and not be taken, and always resist, saying, | will 
not, | will not. O Lord Christ, thou hast promised, Ask, 
and ye shall receive. 2c. Help, dear Lord, against all 
temptations. 

This means a righteous Christian life that is never at 
rest, and is not the opinion that one should feel no sin at 
all; one will feel it, but one should not consent to it. One 
should fast, work, pray, and defend oneself with God's 
word, so that one may curb and suppress lust. 
Therefore, you must not think that you want to become 
a saint, as those fools talk about it. Because blood and 
flesh remain, sin also remains; therefore it must always 
be disputed. Whoever does not experience this must not 
boast that he is a Christian. 





1195 


Up to now we have been taught that if we had 
confessed or entered a spiritual state, we would be pure 
and would no longer be allowed to argue about our sins. 
They also said that baptism makes one pure and clean, 
so that no evil remains in a person: Now | will have good 
rest. Then the devil came and overthrew them worse 
than before. Therefore, if you believe and are baptized, 
and earnestly purpose to be a Christian, you must act 
like a man of war who is in the forefront of the battle; he 
must have his cause in mind, be armed with his 
weapons, and confidently strike out and not stop until the 
battle is over. For he goeth about, saith St. Peter in the 
5th chapter, v. 8, like a roaring lion 2c. 

Therefore, the Christian life is nothing else but a battle 
and army camp, as the Scripture says. Therefore our 


Lord God is called Dominus Zebaoth, that is, Lord over 


the hosts; item: Dominus potens in proelio; thus he 
shows that he is almighty, for he is miraculously 
victorious through us against the prince and god of this 
world, the devil, and against the infernal gates, which 
we, however, are weak, against the devil we can hardly 
count a dull fly. Therefore St. Paul says in 2 Cor. 4, 7: 
"We have our treasure in earthly vessels, that the 
abundant power may be of God, and not of us. 


V. 12. And lead a good walk among the Gentiles, 
that they who speak evil of you, as of evildoers, may 
see your good works, and glorify God, when it shall 
come to pass. 

See how St. Peter keeps such a fine order 1). Now he 
has taught what we should do, that we should subdue 
our flesh with all its lusts; now he also teaches why the 
same should be done. Why should | subdue my flesh? 
That | may be saved? No, but that | may walk in 
righteousness. 


1) Wittenberger: "ein fein orden". 


1196 En. 52, 98-100. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 12-14. 


may lead before the Well. Good conduct does not make 
us righteous before God, but we must be righteous and 
believe before we begin to conduct good conduct. 
Therefore, | should not lead an outward walk in order to 
atone for sin before God and earn salvation, but in order 
to improve and provoke the Gentiles, so that they may 
also come to Christ through us (which is a true work of 
love). They speak evil of us, and reproach us, and think 
us the worst of boys; therefore we should show 
ourselves with such a fine conduct that they must say, 
"Well, we cannot blame them. 

We read that when the emperors ruled and 
persecuted the Christians, they could not be blamed 
except that they worshipped Christ and considered him 
a god; as Pliny wrote to the emperor Trajan that he knew 
of no evil that the Christians did, except that they came 
together early in the morning and sang several hymns to 
honor their Christ and to take the sacrament; otherwise 
no one could blame them. Therefore, St. Peter says: 
"You must suffer that you are reproached as evildoers; 
therefore you should lead such a way that you do not 
offend anyone, so you will make the unbelievers better. 

"When the day comes," that is, you will have to suffer 
so long that you will be shouted at, until one day it will 
break out and be revealed that they will see how they 
have wronged you, and then they will praise God in you. 
Further on now St. Peter speaks: 


V. 13. Be subject to all human order. 


So St. Peter goes along in a fine and orderly way, 
teaching how we should conduct ourselves in all things. 
So far he has spoken in general and admonished that 
each one should abstain from carnal pleasures and lead 
a good life among the unbelievers 2c.; now he begins to 
teach how one should keep oneself against the worldly 
authorities. For since he has now said enough, first of 
all, what one should do against God, for oneself, and 
against one's enemies, he now goes on to say how one 
should conduct oneself against all people, beginning 
with the authorities. 





1197 


2c., saying, First of all, and above all things, when ye 
have done all things, that ye walk therefore in 
righteousness of faith, and keep your bodies in 
discipline, that they follow not evil lusts, and walk in an 
honorable and chaste manner before all the world, let 
this be the first work, that ye obey the authorities. 

That | have here translated: "of all human order", is 


called in Greek language ktioic, and in Latin creatura. 
Our scholars have not understood that either. The 
German language expresses it finely, what the little word 
means, if one says thus: What the prince creates, that 
one shall keep. So he also needs the little word here, as 
if he should say: What the authorities create, in that show 
your obedience. For to create is to command, and order 


is a creature of men. Those have drawn it that creatura 
means an ox and an ass; as the pope also speaks of it. 
If St. Peter meant this, then one would also have to be 
subject to a servant. But it is called human order laws or 
command of the authorities, and what they create that 
one should do. What God creates, gives and wants, that 
is his order, namely that one believes, loves, hopes and 
is patient 2c. Now there is also a human and worldly 
creation, 1) namely, which is written with 
commandments, how the outward rule should be; to 
which we are also to be subject. Therefore understand 


the little word so that creatura humana means: Quod 
creat et condit homo. 


V. 13. 14. For the sake of the Lord, whether it be 
to the king as the ruler, or to the captains as the 
messengers from him, for vengeance on the wicked, 
and for praise to the pious. 

We are (he says) obliged to be obedient to the 
authorities, not only for their sake, so that if we 
disobeyed, they would punish us, but primarily for the 
sake of God, whose children we are. This is to provoke 
us, not that we have any merit in it; for if | am to do 
something for God's sake that is pleasing to Him, | must 
do it with a willing, joyful heart, for His glory and 
thanksgiving, even if the flesh is sore. But why should 
one be obedient to the authorities for the sake of the 
Lord? Because it is his will that 


1) Create - order. 


1198 Erl. 52, 100-102. interpretations on the | Epistle of St. 


to punish the evil-doers and protect the pious, so that 
unity may remain in the world. This is how God wants us 
to promote outward peace. For since we do not all 
believe, but most of the people are unbelievers, he 
created and decreed that the world should not devour 
one another, that the authorities should wield the sword, 
and that if they do not want to have peace, they should 
defend it. This is what he decrees through the 
authorities, so that the world may be governed well in all 
places. 

So you see, if there were not wicked people, no 
authority would be allowed; therefore he says, "for the 
vengeance and punishment of evildoers, and for the 
praise of the pious." The pious shall have a price, if they 
do right, that the worldly authorities praise and crown 
them, so that the others may take an example from it; 
not that one wants to earn something from it before God. 
So also St. Paul says, Rom. 13, 3: "The mighty are not 
to be feared for good works, but for evil. But if thou wilt 
not fear the authorities, do good; and thou shalt have 
praise of them." 


V. 15. For this is the will of God, that with 
benevolence ye should stop up the ignorance of 
foolish men. 


With these words, St. Peter silences the useless 
talkers who boast of the Christian name and status, and 
refutes that they would object here and say: Since a 
Christian has enough in faith, and works do not make 
him righteous, what need is there that one should be 
subject to the worldly authorities, giving them interest 
and lap? To this he answers: "Even though we are not 
justified before God by this, we should still do it freely to 
please God, who wants it, so that the mouths of God's 
enemies may be shut, who reproach us and speak of us 
as of evildoers, so that [they], when they see our 
honorable conduct and good works, can raise nothing 
against us, and must say that we are pious, obedient 
people. Thus one reads of many saints that they have 
gone to war among the pagan princes, and have slain 
the enemies, and have been submissive and obedient 
to the same, even 





1199 


Peter. 


as well as we owe obedience to Christian authorities; 
although it is now considered that we could not be 
Christians if we were under the Turk. 

Now you may say here, Did Christ command that we 
should not resist evil, but if we are struck on one cheek, 
we should offer the other also; how then can we strike 
and choke other people? Answer: In the past, the 
pagans also said such things to the Christians, saying 
that if such were to be the case, their regiment would 
have to perish. But to this we say: It is true that Christians 
should not resist evil for themselves, nor take revenge 
when they are harmed, but should suffer injustice and 
violence; therefore they cannot be hard on unbelievers, 
but this does not forbid the authorities to use the sword. 
For although the pious Christians are not allowed to use 
the sword and the law (since they live in such a way that 
no one can complain about them, they do neither harm 
nor injustice, but do good to everyone and suffer 
everything that is done to them): But the sword must be 
used for the sake of unbelievers, so that those who harm 
others may be punished, and those who do not want to 
do wrong themselves may be forced by force not to do 
harm, so that peace may be preserved and the pious 
protected. 

Thus the authorities are appointed by God to punish 
the wicked and to protect the pious. This is a deliciously 
good work, through which (says St. Peter) God's will is 
done. Therefore, St. Paul also calls the authority God's 
servant, good to him who does good, but punishment to 
him who does evil, because it does not bear the sword 
in vain 2c. Rom. 13, 4. Therefore, believers in Christ may 
also wield the power of the sword, knowing that they are 
doing God a service by forcing and punishing the 
wicked, so that the pious may remain in peace before 
them; and yet the saying of Christ remains that one 
should not resist evil, so that a Christian, even if he 
wields the sword, does not need it for himself, nor does 
he need himself 1). 


1) Wittenberger: "not yet" instead of: nor himself. 


1200 en. 52, 10s-105. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 2, 15. 16. 


1201 





But this is also the work of Christian love, that one 
protects and defends a whole community with the sword, 
and does not suffer that they are offended. The great 
multitude in the world cannot be ruled by kindness, 
therefore one must resist subtle courage; if not, no one 
could be safe from it. 

So there are two kinds of government in the world, 
just as there are two kinds of people, namely believers 
and unbelievers. Christians obey the authorities for 
God's sake without any coercion. Therefore, it must not 
wield the sword for their sake, but for the sake of 
unbelievers who do not want to abide by God's word. 
Otherwise, if we were all Christians and followed the 
Gospel, there would be no need or benefit to use the 
secular sword and force. For if there were no evildoers, 
there could be no punishment. But since this cannot be, 
that we are all pious, God has commanded the wicked 
to be governed by the authorities as they must be 
governed; but the pious he keeps for himself, and 
governs them himself by the mere word. Therefore the 
Christian rule is not against the worldly rule, nor the 
worldly rule against Christ. The secular government 
does not belong to Christ's office at all, but is an external 
thing, like all the other offices and estates; and as these 
are offices apart from Christ, so that an unbeliever leads 
them just as well as a Christian: so also is the office of 
the secular sword, that it makes people neither 
Christians nor un-Christians. But of this | have often said 
enough elsewhere. Now follow on: 


V. 16. as the free, and not as having liberty to the 
cover of wickedness, but as the servants of GOD. 


This is especially said to us who have heard of Christian 
freedom, that we should not go and abuse freedom, that 
is, under the name and appearance of Christian 
freedom, do everything we desire, and thus freedom 
becomes insolence and carnal will; as we see that it is 
now going on, and also already started in the apostles’ 
times (as can well be seen from St. Peter's and Paul's 
epistles), that one has also done as the great crowd is 
doing now. We 





have now, by the grace of God, come to the knowledge 
of the truth again through the dear gospel, and know that 
what the pope, bishops, priests and monks have taught, 
set down and written up to now is vain deceit, and our 
conscience has been saved and freed from the laws of 
men and all the coercion they have exercised with us, 
that we are not guilty of doing anything they have 
commanded for the loss of our blessedness. We must 
now hold fast to this freedom and never let ourselves be 
torn away from it. But we must also be careful not to 
make this freedom a cover of shame. 

The pope acted wrongly in wanting to force and 
enforce people with laws. For there should and can be 
no coercion in a Christian people, for if one tries to bind 
the consciences with external laws, the faith and the 
Christian nature will soon perish. Therefore, Christians 
should and must be led and governed in the spirit alone, 
so that they know that through faith they have everything 
that is necessary for salvation, and that they are not 
allowed to do anything else, and that henceforth they 
owe nothing more, except to praise and glorify God 
through Jesus Christ, and to serve and help their 
neighbor with everything they have, as Christ has 
helped them; So that all the works they do are done 
freely and without compulsion, and flow from a merry 
and glad heart that gives thanks to God for the 
unspeakable goods it has received from Him. Therefore, 
St. Paul says in 1 Tim. 1, 9, that no law is given to the 
righteous, for he does everything freely of himself and 
without commandment, which God wants him to do. 

When such compulsion of the doctrine of men is lifted 
and Christian freedom is preached, then the nefarious 
hearts, which are without faith, fall in and want to be 
good Christians by not keeping the laws of the pope, 
pretend this freedom, that they are not guilty of this; And 
yet they do not do that which righteous Christian 
freedom demands, namely, that they set their hope 
firmly on the grace that is offered to them, and serve 
their neighbor with a cheerful mind, regardless of the 
fact that it is commanded, as true Christians do. So they 
make the Christian freedom only a cover, under 


1202 Erl. 6S, 10S-107. 


interpretations'on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1203 





They disgrace, defile, and tarnish the noble name and 
title of freedom that Christians have. This is what St. 
Peter means here, because he wants to say: "Although 
you are free in all outward things (if you are Christians), 
and should not be forced by laws to be subject to worldly 
authority, since no law is given to the righteous (as we 
have said), you should nevertheless do it willingly and 
freely of your own accord; not as if you had to do it out 
of necessity, but for the sake of God and to serve your 
neighbor. So Christ Himself did, as we read in Matth. 17, 
25, that He gave the interest, since He was free and a 
Lord over all things, because of which He should not 
have done it at all. So he also submitted to Pilate and let 
himself be judged, since he himself said to him [John 
19:11]: "You would have no power nor authority over me, 
if it was not given to you from above"; with which words 
he also confirms the authority himself and therefore 
submits to it, so that it pleases his father. 

From this you see that that group has no part in 
Christian freedom, which does none, neither what the 
world wants, nor what God wants. Therefore it does 
them no good at all, because they remain in the old 
disorderly nature, that they boast of the Gospel, yes, 
under the Christian name they are worse than the 
heathen. We are free from all laws, but we must also 
spare the weak and inexperienced Christians, which is a 
work of love. For St. Paul says Rom. 13:8: "Ye owe no 
man any thing, but to love one another." Therefore, 
whoever wants to boast of freedom, let him do 
beforehand what a Christian should do, namely, to serve 
his neighbor, and then, when the pope or someone else 
suggests his commandment to him, let him urge him to 
keep it for the loss of his soul, so that he may say: Dear 
Pope, | do not want to do it for this very reason, that you 
want to make a commandment out of it for me, and 
encroach on my freedom; for we are to act in freedom as 
servants of God (as St. Peter speaks here), not as 
servants of men. Peter speaks), not as servants of men. 
Otherwise, if someone desires it from me, whom | could 
serve with it, | will gladly do it out of good will, not 
considering whether it is commanded or not. 





but for the sake of brotherly love, and that it pleases God 
that | serve my neighbor. So | do not want to be forced 
to be subject to worldly rulers and lords, but will do it 
willingly of my own accord; not because they command 
me, but for the honor of God, who wants it, and for the 
service of my neighbor. So let all our works be, that they 
flow from desire and love, and all be directed toward our 
neighbor, because we may not do anything for 
ourselves, that we may thereby become godly. Further 
follows: 


v.17.Do honor to everyone. 


We owe honor to everyone, even though we are free; 
for freedom does not extend to wrongdoing, but only to 
good deeds. Now we have often said that every 
Christian by faith obtains all that Christ himself has, and 
so becomes his brother and joint heir. Therefore, as | 
give all glory to the Lord Christ, so | should also do to my 
neighbor. This is not only in outward gestures, such as 
leaning toward him and the like, but rather that | think 
much of him inwardly in my heart, as | think much of 
Christ. "Christians are the temple of God," says St. Paul, 
1 Cor. 3:16, "for the Spirit of God dwells in them." He 
who knows this will certainly show all reverence for his 
neighbor, who is a living temple of God. Thus St. Paul 
also teaches us in Romans 12:10 that one should 
precede the other with reverence, so that each one may 
sit down under the other and lift him up. The gifts of God 
are manifold and unequal, so that one is in a higher 
position than another; but no one knows which is the 
highest in the sight of God. He may well exalt one who 
is in the lowest estate here to the highest there. 
Therefore, even if each one sits high, he should throw 
himself down and honor his neighbor and hold him high. 


Love the brothers. 


| have said above how the apostles separate from 
each other common love and brotherly love. We are 
guilty of loving even our enemies, that is the common 
Christian love. But brotherly love is that we Christians 


1204 Erl. [s, 107-110. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 17-20. 


1205 





to love one another as brothers, and to care for one 
another, since we all have the same goods from God. 
This love is especially required by St. Peter. 


Fear God; honor the King. 


He says to honor kings and all authorities, even if 
they are Gentiles; as Christ also did John 19:11, and 
Jeremiah the prophet exhorted the Jews who were 
carried away to Babylon to pray for those who held them 
captive 2c. 

Here you want to speak: Here you see that one 
should also be obedient to the pope and do what he 
commands. Answer: Yes, if the pope assumes temporal 
authority and acts like another overlord, one should also 
be obedient to him, as if he were to say, "| command you 
to wear a cap or plate, item, to fast on this day, not that 
it counts for anything before God, nor as if it were 
necessary for salvation, but because | want it so, as a 
temporal lord. But if he comes and says, "| command 
you to do this in God's stead, that you accept it as if it 
came from God himself, and stop at the ban and a 
mortal sin," then you say: | will not do it; for | shall so 
honor thee, and be obedient unto thee, that it be not 
against God, who will be feared. Therefore we are to be 
subject to the authorities, and do what they command; 
but that they do not bind our conscience, and command 
only outward things, even if they ride along with us 
tyrannically. For he that taketh away our skirts, let us 
also leave our coats. But if they want to take hold of the 
spiritual government, and catch the conscience, in 
which God alone must sit and rule, one should not obey 
them at all, and also leave the neck over it. 

The temporal realm and government extends no 
further than to external and bodily things; but the pope 
not only takes this to himself, but also wants to have the 
spiritual, and yet has none; for his realm is nothing other 
than clothes, food, endowments, benefices, etc., which 
belong neither to the temporal nor to the spiritual 
government. For what is the world improved by it? It is 
against God to make sin and good works out of it, 





because he is not one; therefore Christ cannot suffer it. 
But he can suffer the temporal government, since it is 
not concerned with sins or good works and spiritual 
things, but has to do with other things, such as how to 
keep and fortify cities, build bridges, establish customs, 
take taxes, keep escorts, protect land and people, and 
punish evildoers. Therefore, a Christian can not only be 
obedient to such a ruler (as long as he does not strike a 
commandment on his conscience) for the sake of 
punishment, but also for the sake of conscience, Rom. 
13:5, which he also does willingly and without constraint. 

Therefore, if any emperor or prince should ask me 
now what my faith is, | shall tell him, not for the sake of 
his territory, but that | am bound to confess my faith 
publicly before everyone. But if he would go further and 
command me to believe otherwise or so, | shall say: 
Dear Lord, wait thou on thy worldly rule; thou hast no 
power to take hold of God in his kingdom, therefore | will 
not obey thee at all. You cannot suffer anyone to 
encroach upon your territory; if someone crosses your 
path without your will, you shoot with guns afterwards: 
do you think that God should suffer that you want to 
push him off his throne and put yourself in his place? St. 
Peter calls the worldly authorities only a human order; 
therefore they have no power to fall into God's order and 
to command by faith. Let that be said of it enough. Now 
continue in the epistle: 

V. 18-20. Servants, be subject with all fear to the 
lords, not only to the kind and gentle, but also to the 
wicked. For this is grace, if a man for conscience' 
sake bears with God iniquity, and suffers iniquity. 
For what price is this, if ye suffer strokes for 
iniquity? But if you suffer and endure for goodness’ 
sake, that is grace with God. 

St. Peter has so far taught how we should be subject 
to secular authorities, and how we should respect them, 
saying how far their power should extend, so that they 
do not encroach on things that belong to the faith. This 
is what is said about the authorities in general, anda 


1206 Eri. 5S, 110-112. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


Teaching for everyone. But now he continues, and 
speaks of such authority, which does not extend over a 
community, but only to particular persons. First, he 
teaches how the household should behave toward their 
masters, and this is the opinion: 

Servants, maids, laborers, day laborers 2c. are 
Christians as well as other people, who are of high 
standing before the world, because they have the word, 
faith, baptism and all heavenly, eternal goods of Christ 
as others; therefore they are as great and high before 
God as they are; but according to the outward nature 
and before the world there is a difference, that they are 
inferior and must serve others. Therefore, because they 
are called to the position of God, they should let this be 
their office, that they are subject to their masters, and 
look to them and take care of them; therefore also the 
prophet in the 123rd Psalm, v. 2, gives a fine similitude, 
thereby indicating how they should serve: "As the eyes 
of the servants look to the hands of their masters, as the 
eyes of the maidservants look to the hands of their 
wives, so our eyes look to the Lord our God" 2c.; that is. 
Servants and maids should do with fear and humility 
what the master or the wife wants; this is what God 
wants, therefore they should also do it gladly with all 
their hearts; in this way they can be sure and certain that 
God likes their work and is pleased with it, if they do it in 
faith and in obedience to God. Therefore, these are the 
best works that each one does according to God's 
command in his profession. A servant or maidservant 
must not think, "Oh, how | am in such a low, wretched 
condition, always having to wait for work, so | cannot 
serve God," as was the common complaint in the Pabst. 
Even if you are a servant, maid 2c., says [t. Peter, 
nothing hinders you; you can serve God just as well as 
another who is of a higher station. Believe that through 
Christ you have obtained forgiveness of sin, 
righteousness and blessedness, and be obedient for his 
sake to your Lord, whether he be pious or wicked, kind 
or strange and angry, and remember: The Lord be what 
he will, and | will serve him, and do this in honor of 
Christ, who served me and died for me, because he will 
have it from me. 

This is the righteous teaching to be found in the 


1207 


This is a tradition that has unfortunately been completely 
suppressed and extinguished in the papacy. But no one 
follows it, except those who are serious Christians. 
Therefore, if you want to be God's child, put this into your 
heart, that you serve as if Christ Himself called you; as 
St. Paul also teaches: "You servants are to be obedient 
to God. Paul teaches, "Ye servants, be obedient in all 
things unto your physical masters, with fear and 
trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ; not with 
service only in view, as pleasing men, but as the 
servants of Christ, that ye do such will of God from the 
heart, with a good will, Let it seem unto you that ye serve 
the Lord, and not men. "2c. "For ye serve the Lord 
Christ," Eph. 6:5-7, Col. 3:24. 

No priest, monk or nun can have such fame and 
security. For none of them can say: God has 
commanded me to keep Mass, to sing matins, to pray 
the seven times, and the like; for they have no command 
from Scripture for themselves. Therefore, if you ask 
them whether they are sure and certain that their 
position pleases God, it is impossible for them to say 
yes. But if you ask a lowly maid why she sweeps the 
house, washes the dishes, milks the cows 2c., she can 
say: | know that my work pleases God, since | have His 
word and command for me to be obedient to my lord and 
wives 2c. This is a great good and a precious treasure, 
which a saint of works is not worthy to know. So also a 
prince can do in his state what God commands and is 
pleased with, if he punishes the wicked and protects the 
pious 2c., as said above; a householder, if he presides 
over his wife and child and his household in a good and 
Christian way 2c. God does not look at how small or 
great the works are, but at the heart, which in faith and 
obedience to God does what its profession requires. But 
it goes on weakly enough: What God gives, nowhere 
wants to go; what men establish and command, 
everyone often runs to. 

Yes, you say, how, then, if | have a whimsical and 
wrathful lord, whom no one can serve with thanksgiving? 
as many such are found. To this St. Peter answers: If 
you are a Christian and want to live to please God, you 
do not have to ask about it, 


1208 en. 52, 112114.Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 18-24. 


1209 





how strange and wondrous your Lord is, but always turn 
your eyes and see what God has given you and wants 
you to do. Therefore you should think: That | serve my 
strange, angry Lord faithfully, | do this for Christ's sake, 
who took on the form of a servant for my sake, Phil. 2, 
7, who wants it from me, and lets me know through his 
apostle St. Paul that it is for his sake. Therefore, do not 
be deceived by the appearance or glitter of hypocritical 
works, but pay attention to what God commands you to 
do and do it with all fear. Certainly, if you allow yourself 
to sin not only against your physical master, but also 
against God, and bring upon yourself his wrath, which is 
infallible to you, he says, "with all fear. Again, if you do 
what God has commanded you, you are doing Him a 
pleasing service and sacrifice. The least work of a 
servant or maidservant is better in the sight of God, if it 
is done according to His command, than the works of all 
the priests and monks in one heap. 

But here St. Peter speaks of servants, as it was with 
them at the same time, when they were serfs, such as 
are still found in some places, especially in Turkey, who 
were sold like cattle, were badly treated and beaten by 
their masters, who also had such freedom that they were 
without danger, even if they beat their servants to death. 
Therefore it was necessary that the apostles 
admonished and comforted such servants with so many 
beautiful, excellent words, that they should also be 
subject to the angry, whimsical masters, whom one can 
do nothing to thank, and serve them faithfully, and suffer, 
even if they did them harm and injustice. 

For he is praiseworthy, he says, who has received a 
good, happy conscience toward God through faith in 
Christ, and thus thinks: "If my Lord were still once so 
angry and strange, | would still not be moved by 
impatience and disobedience, much less pay evil with 
evil, but with all my will endure evil and suffer injustice. 
For if | am greatly wronged and afflicted, what is it but 
that Christ, my Lord and Savior, who never committed 
sin 2c.? 





has shown the greatest, yes, unspeakable good deeds 
to the world, and yet he was so shamefully rewarded for 
it that he had to die as a blasphemer and rebel on the 
cross between two evildoers 2c.? He suffered for the 
sake of good deeds and endured the highest suffering, 
the like of which no man on earth has experienced; | will 
follow him. For the yoke and the burden that he has laid 
on is easy and light. But he who suffers for iniquity, as 
the wicked, disobedient servants, cannot have this glory 
2c. 

Therefore, not only servants, but all Christians must 
bear their cross and follow Christ, and the more one 
suffers injustice, the better it is for him; therefore, you 
should willingly take up such a cross from God and thank 
Him. This is the right suffering that pleases God. For what 
would it be for you to be badly beaten and to deserve it, 
and to boast of the cross? Therefore, St. Peter says: "If 
you suffer and endure for goodness' sake, this is grace 
with God," which is pleasant and a great thanksgiving 
before God, and a right service to God. Behold, there are 
described right, delicious good works to be done; 
whereas the pope with his own has trampled this doctrine 
underfoot, and invented and raised up other works. 
Therefore, we should lift up our hands, give thanks to 
God, and be glad from the heart that we have come to 
this again, and also follow them with all seriousness. Now 
follows further: 


V. 21-24. For to this end were ye called: because 
Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that 
ye should follow in his footsteps: who did no sin, 
neither was deceit found in his mouth; Who 
reproached not when he was reproached, neither 
grieved when he suffered; but reproved him that 
judgeth righteously; who himself offered up our sinin 
his body upon the wood, that we might be freed from 
sin, and live unto righteousness, by whose wounds ye 
were healed. 

This is what | have said, that the servants should be 
formed in the heart and be moved to be willingly subject 
even to their whimsical masters, and to suffer evil for their 
faithfulness and good deeds. Because they hear here 
that Christ, their 


1210 en. 52, 114-116. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1211 





The same thing has happened to our Lord and Savior, 
against whom they are nothing; therefore let them 
remember: Christ, the innocent and undefiled Lamb of 
God, the chosen and precious cornerstone, who has 
done no sin, in whose mouth no deceit is found, 
sacrificed our sin Himself in His body on the cross, not 
for Him, but for us poor, miserable people, so that we 
might be healed by His wounds, and yet has earned no 
thanks from the wicked world: What wonder is it that we, 
who are by nature children of wrath, should receive evil 
reward for our faithful service and labor from our 
physical masters? 2c. 

So now St. Peter wants to say: You servants have 
two reasons that should move you to be gladly and 
willingly subject even to your strange masters. First, 
your profession requires that you suffer for the sake of 
good, and not only endure evil, but also repay it with 
good 1). Secondly, it also requires the example of Christ; 
for over and above the fact that he suffered for us, and 
by his death and resurrection redeemed us from the 
power of the devil, made us righteous and blessed, he 
has also left us an example that we should follow in his 
footsteps, that is, that servants, yes, all of us, each in his 
profession, should show all loyalty and good deeds to 
their masters and to everyone, and in return expect 
ingratitude, hatred, envy, persecution and all misfortune 
as a reward; to this, says St. Peter, we are called. This, 
says St. Peter, is what we are called to do. Christ also 
teaches us this with his own example, who with the 
highest good deeds, both bodily and spiritual, not only 
served his people to whom he was promised, made the 
sick and lepers well and clean, raised the dead 2c., 
preaching the gospel to the poor, but he also became a 
curse, that all the race might be blessed through him: for 
which he received this reward, that he not only heard 
that he was a Samaritan, possessed with the devil, a 
glutton and a winebibber, a publican's and a sinner's 
companion, but he was also finally mocked, reviled, 
scourged, 2c., He is also mocked, scorned, scourged, 
crucified, blasphemed there in the most bitter and 
venomous way, and hanging between two evildoers, as 
an arch-villain, both of them, 


, 1) "with good" is missing in the Wittenberg. 





He died because he had blasphemed God and stirred up 
rebellion against Caesar; and he suffered all these things 
willingly and patiently, not smelling his enemies, not 
reproaching them again, nor grieving them, but bringing 
his cause to him who judges rightly. Yes, he prayed for 
them on the cross, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they 
know not what they do." Therefore, if you want to be a 
true Christian, you should follow your Lord and let 
yourself mourn for those who harm you, and also pray 
for them that God will not punish them. For they do much 
more harm to their souls than they do to your body. If you 
took this to heart, you would forget your misfortune and 
suffer everything gladly. 

But whom such admonition of St. Peter does not 
move to bear all kinds of evil and suffer misfortune, let 
him not boast that he is a Christian; for if the Lord himself 
goes before and treads in the mire, the servant ever goes 
after. If Christ expresses his divine nature and becomes 
the servant of us all, much more should we, who are 
conceived and born in sins, deeply humble ourselves, let 
ourselves go down and become the servants of others 
2c. But if this were to happen, what would our humility, 
obedience, benevolence and suffering be in comparison 
to this high person's humility, obedience, benevolence 
and suffering? of which St. Peter testifies that she has 
not committed any sin 2c., which title belongs to him 
alone. For no saint can boast that he is an apostle, 
prophet or patriarch, that he has not committed any sin 
2c. But they do have the title, as it is written Ps. 14, 3: 
"They have all gone astray, and have all become unfit; 
there is not one who does good, not even one" 2c. That 
is why they all prayed in 2) all of Christendom: Forgive 
us our trespasses, Ps. 32, 5, and were as well comforted 
by the article: Forgiveness of sins through Christ, as we 
are. This is strongly preached, and with many excellent 
words the servants are highly exhorted to obedience; but 
it is a lesson and admonition for the godly who follow 
Christ, for they will not go like him; he does it to all of us 
far before.

Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 2, 21-25. 


1213 





But the great multitude remains as it is, yes, becomes 
worse, aS one now hears everywhere a common 
complaint that the servants are disobedient and 
unfaithful 2c.; God will find them well in his time, punish 
here temporally and there eternally 2c. 

Here St. Peter introduces some sayings from the 
prophet Isaiah in the 53rd, namely these [v. 9]: "He who 
has done no sin, no deceit is found in his mouth"; item 
[v. 5]: "By whose wounds we are healed. All that Christ 
did and said in preaching, counseling, and punishing 
was good, useful, comforting, and blessed; therefore he 
deserved that all should fall at his feet, and bear him up 
in their hands; and had power and right to avenge 
himself on his enemies: neither did he suffer himself to 
be reproached, mocked, blasphemed, and slain, and not 
open his mouth. You should follow the example, and if 
you look at it rightly, and earnestly pursue it, you would 
praise and thank God that you were worthy to become 
like Christ, not grumbling or impatient when you are 
harmed, because your Lord did not rebuke or condemn 
again, but also interceded for his enemies, as | said. 

Here you may speak: How then shall | justify them 
that do me wrong, and say that they have done well? 
Answer: No; but thus shalt thou say: Though | have not 
deserved it, and thou hast wronged me, | will gladly 
suffer it with all my heart, for the sake of my Lord Christ, 
who for his divine, unspeakable good deed suffered all 
evil, and at last an ignominious death upon the cross. 
"He who sacrificed our sin in his own body" (says St. 
Peter), that is, he did not suffer for himself, but for the 
whole human race, so that he might atone for the terrible 
fall of Adae, and set right what the devil had corrupted. 
Whoever does not recognize his gratuitous love, nor is 
grateful to him for it, will not be grateful to God. 





He will not escape the wrath and punishment of the one 
who judges. The Jews, Greeks, Romans 2c. have to 
serve; he will find those who blaspheme and persecute 
the gospel of Christ in his time. 


V. 25 For ye would have been as sheep going 
astray: but now are ye converted unto the Shepherd 
and Bishop of your souls. 


As if to say: Remember that before you also lived in 
the same error and unbelief as those who now put you 
to all harm; but now you are visited and converted 
through Christ, your faithful shepherd and bishop of your 
souls. 

But this is again a saying from the prophet Isaiah, 
Cap. 53, 6. which thus speaks: "We all went astray like 
sheep; each one looked to his own way." But now we 
have received a shepherd (says St. Peter); the Son of 
God came for our sake, that he might be our shepherd 
and bishop; he gives us his Spirit, guides us and feeds 
us with his word, so that we now know how we are 
helped. Therefore, if you know that through him your 
sins have been taken away, you are his sheep, he is 
your shepherd; item, he is your bishop, who strengthens 
and comforts you, so that your soul may have peace and 
rest. Now this is the precious treasure that all Christians 
have. 

So we have two chapters in this epistle, in which St. 
Peter first taught righteous faith, then righteous works of 
love; and he spoke of two kinds of works, first, what we 
should all do in general toward the worldly authorities, 
then how the household servants should behave toward 
their masters; 1) and what St. Peter says here about 
household servants also extends to several other 
persons, namely craftsmen, day laborers, and all kinds 
of hired servants. Now he will go on to teach how 
husband and wife should behave toward each other in a 
Christian manner.

The third chapter. 


V. 1. In the same way, wives are to be subject to 
their husbands. 


Here St. Peter speaks mainly of the women who had 
pagan and unbelieving husbands at that time; and again 
he says of the believing men who had pagan wives. For 
it often happened in those days, when the apostles 
preached the gospel among the Gentiles, that one was a 
Christian and the other was not. Since it was then 
commanded that women should be subject to men, how 
much more must it be so now? Therefore the woman's 
work (says St. Peter) is to be subject to her husband, 
even if he is a Gentile and an unbeliever; and he gives 
the reason why this should be done: 


V. 1. 2. so that even those who do not believe in the 
word may be won over by the way women walk 
without a word, when they see your chaste walk in 
fear. 

That is, if a man sees that his wife, after she has 
become a believer in Christ, is well behaved and fine, that 
he may be provoked to the faith thereby and consider the 
Christian state to be a right good state; and although 
wives are not commanded to preach, yet they should 
lead a chaste, holy walk, in fear and all reverence toward 
their husbands, that they may provoke them to the faith 
thereby; as we read of St. Augustine's mother, who 
converted her husband before he became a pagan. 
Augustine's mother, who converted her husband, wha 
was a pagan, before his death, and after that also her son 
Augustinum. Now this is an outward thing, which one 
should not do in order to become pious before God, fon 
the obedience of a woman to her husband does not make 
her righteous and blessed before God, for one may well 
find an obedient woman who is nevertheless unbelieving; 
but for this reason you should do it, so that you may serve 
your husband, that he may be converted by youn 
honorable, godly conduct. For this is what God has 
decreed in Genesis 3:16, when He says to the woman 
"Your will shall be done for your husband. 








He shall be your master", which is also one of the 
punishments that he has imposed on the consecrated. 
But such (I say) is the outward walk; belongs to the body, 
not to the spirit. 

But this is a great thing, to know what works to do 
that please God; we should run far after it, as we see that 
the world has run with great toil and devotion after that 
which men have devised. This is a high, noble treasure 
that a wife can have, if she keeps herself so that she is 
subject to her husband; then she is sure that her work 
pleases God: what can happen to her that is more joyful? 
Therefore, she who wants to be a Christian woman 
should think like this: | will not consider what kind of 
husband | have, whether he be a Gentile or a Jew, pious 
or wicked; but this | will consider, that God hath put me 
in wedlock, and commanded me that my will should be 
subject to my husband; therefore | will be subject and 
obedient to my husband. When she is in such obedience, 
all her works are golden. 

If the people who are in the marital state knew such 
things and lived according to them, oh how blessed they 
would be! But what is God's work and commandment, no 
one respects; but what men have devised, everyone runs 
to. God wanted to keep this commandment so firmly that 
he also gave the men the power to dissolve the vows that 
the wives had made if they did not please them, as we 
read in Numbers 30:9, so that it would only be peaceful 
and quiet in a house. That is one piece. Now the apostle 
goes on to say how a woman should behave toward other 
people. 


V. 3. 4. Which adornment shall not be by heart, 
with braids of hair, and cloaks of gold, or putting on 
of garments; but the hidden man of the heart 
unfeigned, with a gentle and all-embracing spirit, that 
is delectable in the sight of God. 

This precious treasure, of which St. Peter speaks 
here, is not only to be had by a woman, but also by a 
man. 


1216 e1:. 52, 121-123. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 3, 3-6. 


But here someone would like to ask whether St. Peter 
forbids the Christian women the jewelry. We read of 
Esther that she wore a crown of gold and precious 
jewelry, as befits a queen; so also of Judith. But Esther 
says in her prayer [Pieces in Esther, Cap. 3, 11.]: "Lord, 
you know that | do not respect the splendid ornament 
that | wear on my head when | have to be resplendent, 
but keep it like an unclean cloth, and do not wear it apart 
from the splendor"; and of Judith it is written that she did 
not adorn herself for the sake of showiness, but to praise 
God. Therefore we also say: A Christian woman should 
not adorn herself out of showiness, nor have any desire 
or love for adornment, as the womenfolk commonly do, 
but follow the example of Esther and Judith, adorn 
herself in honor, especially if her husband wants it, or if 
there is any other honest reason for it. But this should be 
her right adornment (as St. Peter says here), that the 
hidden man of her heart is unchanged, pure and sincere 
in faith, without all error and doubt, with a gentle and 
quiet spirit; this is a glorious, delicious adornment before 
God. She is pretty enough adorned when she is adorned 
to her husband. St. Peter does not want her to adorn 
herself to please other people and to be called a beautiful 
woman. Then 1) she should see that she has the inward 
treasure and delicious ornament of the heart, which is 
the hidden man with a gentle and quiet spirit (as St. Peter 
says), and outwardly lead a fine, honorable, chaste walk 
2c. 

It is a sure sign that there is not much spirit where 
one puts much emphasis on the adornment; but if there 
is faith and spirit, he will certainly look at the adornment 
with such eyes as Esther, and speak like her: Lord, you 
know that | consider the crown | wear on my head an 
abomination, and so | must adorn myself; if | did not have 
to do it in honor of my Lord the King, | would rather not. 
Where there is such a woman, she will please the man 
all the more. Therefore they should think (says St. Peter) 
that they adorn the inner man, where there is a gentle, 
quiet spirit, which remains unchanged; not alone, 


1) "shall" is missing in the Wittenberger. 





1217 


He means, as he said, that they should see to it that the 
soul inwardly remains unchanged in the right faith, so 
that it is not injured by false teaching. 

Then such a heart will come forth that does not break 
out and think how it will be seen and praised before the 
world, but how it will increase in faith and knowledge of 
Christ, which is the right inward adornment that is a 
precious thing before God. A woman who is thus minded 
is more beautifully and gloriously adorned in the sight of 
God than when she adorns herself with pure gold, 
precious stones and pearls, and puts on the most 
exquisite garments, which even pagan women can do 
and gloriously flaunt before the world. 

But the adornment of Christian women is, as | said, 
the hidden man of the heart, who is pure from all kinds 
of error and defilement of the spirit. The woman who is 
so adorned, that is, who has a righteous faith and a quiet, 
gentle spirit, that she can obey her husband and be kind 
to him in word and deed, has everything that Christ has. 
For faith (as | said) brings us all the goods of Christ with 
one another. This is a great, precious treasure and such 
an ornament that no one can praise enough. Of this 
ornament one should preach to the womenfolk, that they 
strive for it. If they have it, then they can also make good 
use of the outward things, for everything is pure for the 
pure 2c. Now St. Peter also gives an example of holy 
women, that he stimulates the women to Christianity, 
and says: 


V. 5. 6. For so did the holy women of old adorn 
themselves, who put their hope in God, and were 
subject to their husbands, as Sarah was obedient to 
Abraham, and called him lord. 

As these women have adorned themselves, so do ye 
also, and follow their example. How did they adorn 
themselves? First, they placed their hope in God; 
second, they were obedient to their husbands, not 
coerced or forced, but willingly from the heart for the 
sake of God's command and order. 


1218 en. 52, iis-125.interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


Abraham was obedient, and called him Lord" 2c. For 
thus saith the scripture Gen. 18:10, et seq. when the 
angel came to Abraham, and said, When | come again 
unto thee above a year, Sarah thy wife shall have a son: 
then she laughed with herself, and said, Now that | am 
old, and my lord also is old, shall | yet deal with 
pleasure?" St. Peter took a good look at this saying and 
brought it here, because she would not have called 
Abraham a lord, if she had not been subject to him 
according to God's command and had kept it before her 
eyes. Such is the proper adornment of Christian women, 
to hope in God and to be subject to men. 


What daughters you have become, if you do well 
and are not so shy. 


Women are timid by nature and easily frightened, 
even for very small reasons; that is why some of them 
are so superstitious; one teaches the other that it is not 
worth counting what magic they have. But a Christian 
woman should not be so timid and fearful, running to 
and fro, saying here a blessing, there a blessing; but as 
she meets with it, let it be God's will, and think that no 
evil can befall her. For because she believes in Christ 
and does what is her due, loves her husband, is subject 
to him, loves her children, raises them in the discipline 
and admonition of the Lord, is domesticated, etc., which 
is called doing well by St. Peter, she is sure that her 
position pleases God; why then does she want to be 
afraid? If a child dies, or if she falls ill, or if some other 
misfortune strikes quickly, which she has not foreseen, 
she should not go off the deep end, but should 
command God and put her hope in Him. 2c. This is 
preached to the women. Now follows what the men 
should do. 


V. 7. the same, you men, dwell with them with 
reason, and give honor to the female, as the weakest 
instrument. 


The woman, he says, is God's instrument as well as 
the man, for God needs her to bear children, to give 
birth, to nourish, to wait, and to rule the house; such 
works the woman should do, as St. Paul also teaches 
Titus 2:4 ff. Therefore she is God's instrument 





1219 


and vessel, who created her for this purpose and 
implanted such in her. The man should know this and 
regard his wife for it. Therefore St. Peter says: 
"Husbands, live with your wives with reason. A woman 
should indeed live as the man governs her, what he calls 
her and creates, 1) that shall be done; but he should 
nevertheless neither govern her nor despise her 
according to his great head, but not only deal with her 
neatly and spare her, as a weak vessel and instrument 
of God, but also honor her, as she is also partaker of the 
grace of eternal life: So that the man, who is a stronger 
instrument of God, should deal with his wife, who is 
weaker in body and more stupid and timid in spirit, in 
such a way that she can bear it. He should deal with her 
as he would with a tool, so that he can work. For 
example, if he wants a good knife, he must not use it to 
chop stone. No rule can be given to this: God will teach 
every man himself to deal wisely with his wife, according 
to the skill of every woman. For thou shalt use the power 
thou hast as thou wilt; yea, thou art her husband 
therefore, that thou mayest help her, keep her, and 
protect her, and not that thou mayest destroy her. The 
goal cannot be set for you; you must know for yourself 
how you should proceed with reason. 

So now we also have from husbands what they 
should do for good works that please God, namely, that 
they dwell with their wives, and feed them and deal with 
them cleanly. But it will not always be as straight as you 
would like. Therefore see to it that you are a man and 
have all the more sense where there is too little in a 
woman. You must be patient at times, give in a little, and, 
when necessity demands it, not only give way to the 
weak vessel, but also give it its honor. 

Honor has been interpreted, but | don't know how. 
Some have interpreted it to mean that the husband 
should provide the wife with food, drink and clothing, and 
feed her; others have made it a marital duty. | had 
thought that this was the

2) Wittenberger: not alone not. 


1220 En. 52, 125-127. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 3, 7. 8. 


Opinion, as | said, that the man should look at the 
woman in such a way that she is also a Christian, and 
God's work or equipment; that therefore on both ropes it 
should happen that the woman holds the man in honor, 
and again, the man also gives his honor to the woman. 
If the three of them were well suited, things would go well 
in peace and love; otherwise, where there is no art, there 
is vain unhappiness in the marriage state. Therefore, 
when husband and wife take each other for the sake of 
pleasure alone, thinking they want to have good days 
and good air, they find heartache. But if you consider 
God's work and will, you can live a Christian life in 
marriage, not like the pagans who know nothing of God. 


As also joint heirs of the grace of life. 


The man does not have to consider that the woman 
is weak and infirm, but that she is also baptized and has 
exactly what he has, namely all heavenly, eternal goods 
of God in Christ. For inwardly we are all equal, there is 
no difference between man and woman, Gal. 3, 28. Col. 
3, 11.; but outwardly God wants the man to rule and the 
woman to be subject to him. 


So that your prayer will not be hindered. 


What does St. Peter mean by this? This is what he 
means: If you do not act with reason, but always want to 
murmur, grumble and rumble, and with your head 
through it, and it is also frail, and neither wants to provide 
anything for the other nor have anything to give, then 
you will not be able to pray. There we see that Christians 
should pray. For though they are in the grace of God for 
Christ's sake, in whom they believe, yet the devil does 
not celebrate, but goes about them like a roaring lion 2c.; 
over which the world is to them, persecuting them 2c.; 
so also their own flesh afflicts them; against which they 
have no other defense or weapon, but prayer. But if 
prayer is to be righteous, all dissension, displeasure, 
and anger must be put away; otherwise it is never well 
to pray, nay, it is soon at odds when you begin to say 
Our Father 2c. That is why St. Peter teaches that wives 
should be subject to their husbands; they should in turn 
live with them with reason; if not, their prayer will be 
prevented, 





1221 


which is a sign that they are not Christians, have no 
forgiveness of sins from God, because they do not 
forgive one another 2c. Now these are the right, 
delicious good works that we should do. If this were 
preached and known, we would all have a house full of 
1) good works at home. So far we have heard how 
Christians should be in all ranks, and especially one 
against another. Now he teaches how they should keep 
themselves among themselves, namely, "to be like- 
minded" 2c., then against their enemies who persecute 
them and do them all harm, namely, that they do not 
repay evil with evil 2c., and thus speaks: 


V. 8. Finally, all of you are of the same mind. 


All this is said in no other way than that we should 
love one another. For here is boldly put forth, which the 
Scripture otherwise comprehendeth in few words. So 
now St. Peter wants to say: This is Summa Summarum 
of it, how you should keep yourselves after the outward 
life, that you are like-minded. The apostles St. Peter and 
Paul often use this word, and so much is said that we 
should all have one doctrine, one faith, one mind, one 
courage, one conceit, which seems right and good to 
one, so that 2) the same thing seems right and good to 
the other. It is an excellent, remarkable word, which 
should ever be well grasped; St. Paul wrote especially 
much about it. 

We cannot all do the same work, for every man must 
do one thing for himself; a man another than a woman, 
the servant another than the master, and so on, every 
man according to his calling. Therefore it is a clumsy 
thing to teach that we should all do one work, as the fool 
preachers did, who held up the legends of the saints to 
the people and said, "You are in a state where you 
cannot serve God; therefore look at this or that saint, 
what he has done for a life and for works, follow him. 
There is no doubt that Abraham did a good, delicious 
work when he sacrificed Isaac, his son, because it was 
specially commanded to him by God. Then 


1) the second "full" is missing in the Wittenberger. 
2) "that" is missing in the Wittenberg. 


1222 en.52, 128-130. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1223 





The pagans also wanted to sacrifice their children, which 
was an abomination in the sight of God. In the same 
way, King Solomon did well when he built the Temple, 
and God rewarded him. Now our blind leaders also go 
and preach that one must build churches and temples 
here and there in honor of the dear saints, when nothing 
of this is commanded by God. So it is now the other way 
around, that one does one kind of work, and one has one 
kind of mind, straight against the teachings of St. Peter. 

So you should teach that there should be one mind 
and many works. One heart and many hands. Not all 
should do one work, but each one should wait for his 
own; otherwise there will not remain one mind and heart. 
All Christians should have the thoughts: Nothing makes 
me righteous in the sight of God except faith in Christ; 
so one mind and many works remain, for each one waits 
for that which is commanded him by God; if not, one 
thinks to be saved by this work, another by another, then 
one leaves his work pending, and does something that 
seems good to him, without, yes, against God's 
command, which the Scripture severely reproves. 
Therefore, this admonition, "Be of the same mind, all of 
you," is useful and necessary to be understood, for the 
devil takes special care of it, and has also brought it 
about in such a way that people forget such unity and 
fall on their works; for each one thinks that his work is 
better than the other. That is why they have become so 
divided among themselves, monks against priests, one 
order against the other, because each one wanted to do 
the best work. Then they fell in with one another, and set 
themselves on the orders, and thought that the order 
was better than the other; the Augustinian against the 
preacher, 1) the Carthusian against the Barefoot, 2) so 
that everything was divided, and nowhere was there 
greater disagreement than among the orders. 

But if it had been taught that no work was better in 
the sight of God than another, but that through faith they 
were all made equal, so that hearts were one and all 
men remained like-minded, they could have been.... 


1) Preacher ----- Dominicans. 
2) Barefoot ----- Franciscans. 





nen speak: The order or rank which the bishop leads is 
neither better nor greater in the sight of God than that 
which a bad man leads; nor is the rank which a nun 
leads better than that which a legitimate woman leads, 
and so on. For no one is saved by his rank or order, 
otherwise Christ would have died in vain. But they do not 
want to hear this, but each one wants to be the best, and 
they say: How can my position in the order not be better 
and greater than the position of the common man? 

Therefore, to have one mind is to hold each man's 
work equal to another's, as that the marital estate is as 
good as the virgin's estate; as indeed all things are equal 
in the sight of God, who judges according to the heart 
and faith, not according to the person nor according to 
works. Therefore, we should judge as God judges, so 
that hearts would remain undivided, so that they would 
not be divided over the outward essence, and if there 
were one mind, and if there were unity among us, each 
one would consider it good, and it would please him well, 
what each one would do for work according to his 
profession. 

This is anecessary teaching that St. Paul often points 
out. 2 Cor. 11:3: "I fear lest, as the serpent deceived 
Evam, so also your minds be deceived from the 
simplicity of Christ," that is, lest the devil also deceive 
you, and rend and separate the simple mind which you 
have received from my teaching. Item, Phil. 4, 7: "The 
peace of God, which is higher than all understanding, 
keep your hearts and minds in Christ JEsu." Why does 
the apostle care so much about the mind? Ei, it is all 
because of it. For if | fall into a wrong sense, all is already 
lost. For if | am amonk, and have conceived such a mind 
that my work is more worthy in the sight of God than 
others, and say, Thank God that | have become a monk, 
and that my state is now better than the common 
married state, then pride must follow from the mind, and 
cannot remain outside, that | think myself more pious 
than another, and despise other people: then | deceive 
myself, as the Pharisee Luc. For a married woman, if 
she stand in faith, is better before God than | with my 
order. 


1224 En. 52, 130-132. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 3, 8. 


1225 





Therefore, knowing this, that faith brings with it all that a 
Christian should have, we all have One mind and 
opinion, and there is no difference among works. 

Therefore, St. Peter's saying must be understood to 
mean my spiritual, not outward, sense, and an inward 
opinion or conceit, which concerns the things that are 
valid in the sight of God, that both doctrine and life are 
one and the same, and that | consider good that which 
you consider good, and again, that which is pleasing to 
you is pleasing to me; as | have said. Christians have the 
mind, and over the mind we are to hold fast, lest it go 
mad, as St. Paul speaks. For if the devil perverts the 
mind, he hath perverted the right virgin lock, and 
thereupon all is lost. 


Compassionate, brotherly, warm, friendly. 


To be compassionate means that one takes care of 
the other and lets his neighbor's distress go to his heart 
when he is in trouble, so that you don't think, "That's right, 
that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, 
that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, 
that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right. Where 
there is love, it takes care of the neighbor when he is in 
trouble, so that it goes to its heart just 1) as if it were 
happening to itself. 

But to be brotherly is so much that one holds the 
other as for his brother. Now this is easy to understand, 
for nature itself teaches it. You see that true brothers, if 
they are not otherwise brutes, stick together much harder 
than any other friends. We Christians should do the 
same, for we are all brothers through baptism and have 
the same goods in Christ, so that after baptism my father 
and mother are also my brother and sister, for | have the 
same goods and inheritance that they have in Christ 
through faith. 

"Cordially," viscerosi. | cannot interpret this word in 
any other way than to give a simile. Behold, as a mother 
does toward her child when it is in distress, her motherly 
heart is moved in her womb. This is spoken of in many 
places in Scripture. There is also a history of it in the 
books of the 


1) Thus in the first redaction and in the Erlanger. In the Wittenberg: 
thus probably. 


Kings, 1 Kings 3:16 ff. Two women quarreled about a 
child before King Solomon, one of them wanted to have 
the child. When the king wanted to know which was the 
child's right mother, he had to go into nature, where he 
found it. 2) He said to both wives, "You say that the child 
is yours, and you say that it is yours; so get a sword and 
divide the child into two pieces, give one piece to the one 
and one to the other. Then he came to know which was 
the right mother. For the text speaks there [v. 26] that her 
motherly heart trembled over her son and said: Do not, 
do not! rather give the child to this one alive, and do not 
kill it. Then the king made such a judgment and said: This 
is the right mother, take and give her the child. Therefore 
you can take what this word means "heartily". 

St. Peter wants us to treat each other like true blood 
friends; just as the whole heart, marrow, veins and all 
powers are moved, so it should also be heartfelt and 
motherly here, so that one Christian man should bear 
such courage toward another. But the goal is truly 
ambitious; one will find very few of them who bear such 
a heartfelt love for their neighbor when they see that a 
need affects them, that they are moved just as a mother 
is moved by her child, so that it penetrates through the 
heart and all the veins. There you see what monks' and 
nuns' lives and beings are, how far they are from such 
heartfelt love; if you were to melt them all together in one 
heap, you would not find a drop of such Christian love. 
Therefore, let us watch and take care of ourselves, 
whether we find such a kind of love in ourselves. It is a 
short sermon and soon said, but it is not soon done. 

"Friendly" is that one should outwardly conduct 
oneself in a fine, gentle, sweet manner; not only that one 
should take care of the other, as father and mother do of 
their child, but also that one should deal with the other 
with love and gentleness. There are some stubborn and 
bruised people, like a tree with many branches, so 
unkind that no one likes to deal with them. This comes 
from the fact that the same people are common to all. 


2) Wittenberger: he spoke. 


1226 en. 52, 132-134. interpretations on, the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1227 








They are only full of suspicion and soon become angry; 
no one likes to deal with them. But these are fine people 
who interpret all things for the best, and are not 
suspicious, are not soon angered, can well hold 


something to good, who are called Candidos. This virtue 


is called by St. Paul yonotdotng¢, and is often praised by 
him. 

The gospel portrays the Lord Christ in such a way 
that this virtue is especially felt in him. Now and then the 
Pharisees attack him in this way, now and then, that they 
might see him: yet he will not be angered. Item, although 
the apostles often stumble grossly, and fool here and 
there, he nevertheless nowhere snorts at them, but is 
always friendly, and deals with them in such a way that 
they were heartily pleased to be around him and to deal 
with him. This is also seen among good friends and 
companions on earth; if there are two or three of them 
who are well able to get along with each other, if one of 
them is foolish, the other can very well take it in his favor. 
There it is also a little illustrated what St. Peter means 
here, although not enough, because this kindness 
should be offered to everyone. From this you can see 
the right kind of love that Christians should have for one 
another. The angels in heaven live in this way through 
one another; it should also be this way on earth, but 
weakness and infirmity run underneath. 

Just as St. Peter said that servants and maids, 
husband and wife, should keep themselves in this way, 
so that each one should wait for his office to be done, so 
he wants all of us to be of the same mind in common, 
compassionately 2c. Therefore, if you want to be sure 
and certain that you are doing a good work that is 
pleasing to God, let everything be done in God's name 
that has been preached without God's command, out of 
your own devotion and good opinion, in the devil's 
name, so that the world will go around and earn heaven. 
But how can you be more sure that you please God, if 
you first believe that you have a gracious God through 
Christ, and then do what God has commanded you in 
your profession; and in this you 1) agree with all 
Christians, are compassionate, brotherly, cordial, 
friendly. There- 


1) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "stinipts". 





St. Peter leaves it alone, says only about faith, hope, 
love, and about the works, which every man is obliged 
to do according to God's commandment in a fine state; 
does not remember the monkey game with a word, of 
which the pope's sons alone have cried out, and the 
world has written full of books, namely of their spiritual 
state, vows, chastity 2c., which must be far more holy 
and delicious thing, as St. Peter teaches here. 

Therefore the devil is opposed to Christian doctrine, 
in short, he cannot stand it, for he knows that with it his 
lies will come to nothing; therefore he thinks up what he 
can to suppress such doctrine, awakens his servants, 
who cry out: If you say that our thing is nothing, then the 
devil is speaking to you 2c. Then say to them again: You 
will not punish St. Peter with lies, who first of all points 
us to Christ, then teaches and instructs all classes how 
they should conduct themselves in their outward 
conduct; item, that they should be compassionate to one 
another 2c. and forgive their enemies 2c. These things 
he spake as an apostle of Christ, full of the Holy Ghost; 
thou shalt do no better 2c. | am quite surprised that such 
blindness has arisen among us. Thomas, the preacher- 
monk, 2) has written, and says impudently, that monks 
and priests are in a better state, than common 
Christians, only because they are modest, with clothes, 
food 2c. differently behaved, than the common 
Christians. The high schools have affirmed this, and 
made doctors about it. Then the pope came with his 
own, and raised to sainthood those who taught such 
things. 

Therefore, as | have said, understand what Christ 
himself and all the apostles have taught, namely: If you 
want to do the best good works and be in the best state, 
you will find nothing else than faith and love, which is the 
highest state. Therefore it must be a lie and a forgery for 
them to say that their state is better than faith and love. 
If it is better, it is better than God's word; if it is above 
God's word, it is also above God Himself. Therefore St. 
Paul is right

said that the end-Christ will rise above everything that is 
called God or worship, 2 Thess. 2, 4. Know therefore 
how to judge these things: Where love and kindness are 
not, all works are surely condemned, and trample it all 
under foot. Thus we see how St. Peter has so bravely 
set forth how a righteous Christian life should stand 
according to outward character, after he has masterfully 
taught above how the inward life should stand against 
God; therefore this epistle is to be considered a right 
golden epistle. This is followed by the following: 


V. 9 Do not repay evil with evil, not evil with evil, 
but bless, knowing that you are called to inherit the 
blessing. 


But this is another transfiguration of love, how we 
should do against those who insult and persecute us. If 
they do evil to you (he wants to say), you do good; if they 
rebuke and curse you, you rebuke and bless. This is truly 
a great piece of love. O Lord God, how strange such 
Christians are! 

But why should we give good for evil, blessing those 
who curse us? Therefore (he says) that you are called 
to inherit the blessing, 2) that is, from children of wrath 
and enemies of God, to become children of grace and 
friends of God through Christ; therefore you have no 
cause to reproach again, but to bless 2c. 

For this you have received a blessing from God, not 
only for yourselves, but also to bless those who are still 
cursed, that is, to pray for them that they may also come 
to faith through your teaching, patience and good 
conduct. But if they are lost, continue to offend you and 
curse you, consider how highly God has exalted and 
honored you; for the blessing you are to inherit 4) is not 
temporal, nor is it directed to this fleeting life, but this is 
that you may now be blessed through Christ.

stum with God in grace, have forgiveness of sins, have 
been saved from death and the power of the devil, and 
now have to wait for eternal life and salvation. Of this 
you are sure, because you were baptized into it, and 
have received the Holy Spirit through the word of grace, 
who assures you of it. Therefore, if you should let your 
necks go, what would it be against this glory? Therefore 
you have much more reason to pray for your enemies 
and have compassion on them than to be angry with 
them 2c. They are children of wrath and cursing, they 
could not be more afflicted; if they now do wrong, it will 
be found in its time that they will weep bitterly enough 
and have to suffer their punishment because of it, if here 
not temporally, but there eternally in the abyss of hell. 


V. 10 For whosoever would live to see good days, 
let his tongue be silent, that it speak no evil; and his 
lips, that they deceive not. 


This saying, which St. Peter introduces here from the 
34th Psalm, v. 13 f., is especially important for teaching. 
Because he speaks here of the outward conduct of 
Christians, he has drawn it very finely to it, teaching 
them how they should create peace and good days for 
themselves, saying that they should not stand or strive 
for it, like the children of the world, who can no sooner 
have peace and tranquility, because they take revenge 
and cool their temper on those who have done them 
harm, with hand or mouth. Therefore you shall do to him 
thus: If the world or false brethren prove evil against you, 
do you wrong or harm, reproach and curse you, do not 
be hasty in your anger to avenge yourselves, repay evil 
with evil, and reproach with reproach; Otherwise you will 
get two kinds of misfortune for one, outwardly, damage 
to body, honor or goods, inwardly a troubled heart, an 
evil conscience, lose in addition your best treasure, 
namely God's grace and blessing, and invite upon 
yourselves His wrath and the eternal curse; but 
surrender in patience and set your heart at rest, and 
remember: It is enough that | have received harm in loan 
or goods, or am evil scolded 2c. If | should lose my 
heart's peace and joy over it, and become angry and 
impatient, and do evil again.

1231 





Do and curse, which is the devil's delight and joy? That 
is far away 2c. 

That is St. Peter's "fine tongue keep silent, so that it 
does not speak evil, and his lips, so that they do not 
deceive"; which art only the Christians can, yes, are still 
students in it, because it can not be learned so soon. 
With unbelievers there is a contradiction: if you punish 
them and tell them the truth, they curse you with all their 
plagues; if they suffer or are harmed, they repay you 
sevenfold 2c. 


V. 11: He turns from evil and does good; he seeks 
peace and pursues it. 


This is what the world takes for peace, when 
someone wrongs another, hits him on the head and 
takes revenge on him. But this is no way to achieve 
peace, for no king, no emperor, has ever been able to 
do this, to be content in the face of enemies. The Roman 
Empire was so powerful that it crushed everything that 
opposed it, but they could not keep it that way. Therefore 
this way is useless for peace. For if you put down one 
enemy and deceive him, ten or twenty will rise again until 
he is destroyed. But he that seeketh peace aright, and 
shall find it, that holdeth his tongue and his lips in 
silence, and turneth from evil, and doeth good, as | have 
said; which is another way, as the world goeth. 

To turn from evil and do good means, when one 

hears evil words, not to repay evil with evil, but to bless, 
item. To not only bear and suffer evil and injustice, but 
to overcome evil with good. Therefore, when your 
enemy cools his temper against you and does you all the 
harm he can, if you interrogate, rebuke and do not rage 
again, but bless him and do him all the good you can, 
you seek peace and find it, that is, you keep a good 
conscience and a kind, calm heart that can speak with 
right confidence: Forgive us, dear Lord, our trespasses 
2c. 
But he does not add in vain, "He seeks peace and 
pursues it." For only do not think that peace will pursue 
you; indeed, you will feel it when, through no fault of your 
own, you suffer evil and are scolded. 


that you will be moved to anger, impatience, revenge, 
2c. that you would gladly repay evil with evil; but here it 
is time that you stand firm and overcome yourself, hurt 
yourself and pursue peace. This happens when you do 
not repay evil with evil, nor curse again, but command 
God and comfort yourself that you are a child of grace 
and blessing, and pray that you will not fall into 
temptation. 2c. Now he concludes this exhortation with a 
promise: 


V. 12 For the eyes of the LORD are upon the 
righteous, and his ears upon their prayer: but the 
face of the LORD is upon them that do evil. 


If you can believe that the eyes of the Lord neither 
sleep nor slumber, but look upon those who keep peace 
outwardly with mouth and tongue, and inwardly have a 
kind heart toward their enemies, then you can easily 
endure all kinds of temptation 2c. 

This is a very beautiful, glorious consolation for the 
righteous, that is, believers in Christ, who are persecuted 
in the world and have to suffer much, and yet hold their 
fist so that they do not repay evil with evil, and their 
tongue and lips remain silent, so that they do not curse 
again, but do good to their enemies and bless them, That 
the Lord turn not away his face from them, as though he 
were angry with them; that his eyes also sleep not, nor 
slumber (as they think they do, when they are thus 
persecuted), but look upon them graciously, as his dear 
children, and keep them in a good watch. They must 
suffer much, as the psalm says afterwards; but he helps 
them out of all this 2c. What they ask of God, they are 
surely granted, for his ears, he says, are attentive to their 
prayer. If this is true, as it undoubtedly must be, for the 
prophet David does not lie, then he will not forget our 
prayer, nor will he leave it out of his sight; we should take 
comfort in this. 

This is also what should move a Christian man, that 
he should only suffer with all patience all injustice and 
dishonor that can be inflicted on him. For if one thinks it 
over rightly, he sees that the soul of the one who has 


1232 Eri. 52, 139-141. 


second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 3, 12-15. 


1233 





Suffering, where he does not convert, must burn 
eternally in the infernal fire. For he goes on to say that 
the Lord's face is upon those who do evil; he does not 
look upon them with kindly eyes, as the righteous do, but 
with an angry face. In a man who is fiercely angry, one 
sees his whole face disguised and inverted; he looks 
sour, grits his teeth, frowns, mouths and noses, and all 
the while looks like one who wants to throw himself in 
with all his might. With such a face, he wants to say, the 
Lord looks at those who do evil, so that he wants to 
eradicate their memory from the earth; as all history 
testifies, that he has eradicated many great, powerful 
potentates, so that neither trunk nor root remains. So it 
finally comes to pass that all who persecute the 
righteous do harm only to themselves, lose the blessing 
and the kindly face of the Lord, are not only cut off here 
for a time, but are also guilty there, wherefore they must 
be eternally damned. 

Therefore a Christian heart should say: Dear Father, 
because our enemies fall so horribly into your wrath, and 
throw themselves so miserably into the eternal fire, | 
pray that you will forgive them, save them from wrath, 
and show mercy, as you did to me. For as he looks with 
favor on the righteous, so he looks with displeasure on 
the wicked, and wrinkles his face, and has turned it in 
anger on them. Knowing then that he looks upon us with 
favor, and upon those with disfavor, let us have mercy 
upon them, and let us mourn, and pray that he may 
increase our faith, that we may believe these things (that 
he looks kindly upon us who suffer), and be glad, and 
give understanding to those who persecute us, that they 
may believe it to be true that God is angry with them, that 
they may be afraid of it, and be converted. Further, St. 
Peter speaks: 


V. 13. And who is he that might harm you, if ye do 
that which is good? 


If we do what is good, that is, do not repay evil with 
evil, but are cordial and kind to our enemies, 2c. there is 
no one who can harm us. For though honor, body, and 
goods be taken from us, yet are we unharmed, because 
that 





We have a good that cannot be compared to what can 
be taken away from us. Those who persecute us have 
nothing but good on earth, then eternal damnation; but 
we have an eternal, imperishable good, even if we lose 
the temporal. 


V.14. Even though you suffer for righteousness, 
you are blessed. 


Not only can no one harm you if you suffer for the 
sake of God and righteousness, but you are also blessed 
and should rejoice that you suffer; as Christ also says 
Matt. 5:11 ff: "Blessed are you when men revile you and 
persecute you for my sake, and speak all kinds of evil 
against you, when they lie about it; be joyful and 
confident, for you will be well rewarded in heaven. 
Whoever then grasps the fact that the Lord says these 
things and speaks them so sweetly and comfortingly into 
the heart, stands well; but whoever is not strengthened 
by this, and is not made confident and 2) courageous, 
will probably remain unstrengthened. 


V. 14. 15. But do not be afraid of their defiance, 
and do not be dismayed; but sanctify God in your 
hearts. 


But St. Peter cites a saying from the prophet Isaiah 
Cap. 8, 12. f., where he says: "Do not fear as they do, 
and do not be afraid, but sanctify the LORD of hosts, and 
let him be your fear and your terror" 2c. There we have 
a strong protection and back, on which we may rely, that 
no one can harm us. Let the world terrorize, defy and 
oppress as long as it wants, it must have an end; but our 
comfort and joy will have no end. So let us not be afraid 
of the world, but let us be courageous; but before God 
let us be humble and fearful. 

But what does St. Peter mean by saying that we 
should sanctify God? How can we sanctify Him; must He 
not sanctify us? Answer: He says right, for so we pray 
also in the Lord's Prayer, when we say: "Sanctified" 2c., 
that we sanctify His name, even though He is holy 
before. Therefore, in your hearts (says St. Peter) you 
should sanctify him,

1234 en, 52, 141-143. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


That is, if our Lord God sends us something, whether it 
is good or bad, whether it is good or bad, whether it is 
shame, honor, happiness or misfortune, we should 
consider it not only good, but also holy, and say: This is 
the most precious sanctuary of which we are not worthy 
2c. Therefore the prophet Ps. 145:17 says: "The Lord is 
righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works." 
Therefore, if | accept God's ways, and give Him the 
praise, and consider His works good, holy and delicious, 
| sanctify Him in my heart. 

But those who run to the law books and complain that 
they are wronged, and say that God is asleep and does 
not want to help the right or to prevent injustice, they 
dishonor Him and do not consider Him righteous or holy. 
But he who is a Christian must give right to God, wrong 
to himself, consider God holy, but himself unholy, and 
say that he is holy and righteous in all his deeds and 
works. This is what he wants; as the prophet Daniel says 
Cap. 9, 7:"O Lord, you are righteous in all that you have 
done to us, you do us justice in punishing us" 2c. When 
one sings Deo gratias and Te Deum laudamus, and 
says: God be praised and blessed, when adversity 
befalls us, that is St. Peter and Isaiah sanctifying the 
Lord rightly. 

But by this he does not mean that you should say that 
he who has offended you has done right and well. For 
there is much other judgment between God and me, and 
between me and you. | can have anger, hatred and evil 
air in my heart, so that | do not harm you, and you are 
still unoffended and have nothing against me; but before 
God | am unjust; therefore if he punishes me, he does 
right, | have well deserved it; if he does not punish me, 
he shows me mercy; and so he is always right. But it 
does not follow that he who persecutes me does right. 
For | have not wronged him, as | have done before God. 
When God sends the devil or evil men to punish you, he 
needs them to carry out his justice; so that evil men and 
injustice in the play are also a good thing. 

Thus we read Ezek. 29, 18. f. of the king 
Nebuchadnezzar, where God speaks through the 
prophet: "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar, who is 





1235 


King of Babylon, led his army before Tyre with great 
difficulty, and yet neither he nor his army was rewarded 
for his work before Tyre; behold, | will give him Egypt 
land" 2c. The king had no right to the land of Egypt, but 
God was right to punish the Tyreans through him. So that 
the wicked boys also serve him, and do not eat the bread 
for free, he gives them enough, lets them also serve him, 
that he not only persecutes the heathen, but also his own 
people, in which there were many saints, 2). Reason falls 
in and thinks that they are doing well and justly; but if he 
pays them here alone, he gives them much land here, 
and does it for this very reason, that they are his masters 
and persecute the pious Christians. But if thou sufferest, 
and sanctifieth God, and sayest, Right, O Lord, well unto 
thee; those that have done wrong he will in his time find, 
and cast into the pit of hell, and torment with everlasting 
torment; but thee he will accept with mercy, and give thee 
everlasting blessedness. Therefore let him do it, and he 
will reward you well. 

We have an example of this from St. Job. When all 
his cattle and children were slain, and all his goods taken 
away, he said [Cap. 1:21], "The LORD hath given, and 
the LORD hath taken away: blessed be the name of the 
LORD." And when his wife came, mocking him, scolding 
him, and saying [Cap. 2, 9.], "Do you still hold to your 
piety? bless GOD and die," he answered [v. 10.], "You 
speak as foolish women speak. Have we received good 
from GOtt, nor should we accept evil?" GOD gave, and 
GOD took away (he says); not, GOD gave, the devil took 
away; though the devil had done it. The man has 
sanctified the Lord rightly, therefore he is also so highly 
praised and commended by God. Now continue: 


But always be responsible to everyone, who 
demands the reason for the hope that is in you.

Thanksgiving 2c. This is what the pope has ever done, 
as it is in the day; therefore he is the right anti-Christ. 
For what Christ teaches and gives, he opposes. What 
Christ sets free, he binds. Christ says it is not sin to need 
all kinds of food 2c.; so the pope says it is sin. 

Now therefore learn to give the cause and answer of 
faith: for it shall come to pass, that if it be not in life, it 
shall be in death. Then the devil will come forth and say: 
Why did you call the pope a final Christian? If you are 
not prepared and know the reason, he has won. So now 
here St. Peter wants to say: Because you have now 
become believers, you will have much persecution in the 
future, but in the persecution you must have a hope and 
wait for eternal life. If you are asked why you hope for 
this, you must have God's word to build on. 

The Sophists have also inverted this text, that one 
should overcome the heretics with reason and from 
Aristotle, the natural light, therefore that in Latin it says 


rationem reddere, as if St. Peter meant, one should do it 
with human reason. That is why they say that Scripture 
is much too weak to overthrow heretics, that it must be 
done with reason and come from the brain, from which 
it must be proved that faith is right, since our faith is 
above all reason and is God's power alone. Therefore, 
if people do not want to believe, keep quiet; for you are 
not guilty of forcing them to believe that the Scriptures 
are God's book or word; it is enough that you give your 
reason for it. As, if they do so, and say: You preach that 
one should not hold the doctrine of men, when St. Peter 
and Paul, even Christ himself, were men; if you hear 
such people, who are so blinded and obdurate that they 
deny that this is God's word, what Christ and the 
apostles have spoken and written, or doubt it: then only 
be silent, do not speak a word to them, and let them go; 
only speak thus: | will give thee reason enough from the 
Scriptures; if thou wilt believe it, well; if not, go always. 
Then you say: Ei, so 





then God's word must stand with shame. Command God 
to do so. Therefore, it is necessary to understand this 
and know how to deal with those who now stand up and 
pretend such foolishness. Follow: 


V.16. And this with meekness and fear. 


That is, when you are asked about your faith, you 
should not answer with proud words, and want to lead 
the matter out with defiance and violence, as if you 
wanted to uproot trees, but with such fear and humility, 
as if you were standing before God's court, and should 
answer there. For if it should happen that you were 
summoned before kings and princes, and had prepared 
yourself for a while with sayings, and thought thus: Wait, 
| will answer them rightly; then it may come about that 
the devil takes the sword out of your hands before you 
know it, and gives you a blow, so that you stand with 
shame, and would have armed yourself in vain; he could 
also tear out of your heart the sayings that you would 
have best conceived, so that you would be lacking, if you 
had it well in mind; for he has sensed your thoughts 
before. God allows this to happen, so that he may curb 
your arrogance and humble you. 

Therefore, if thou wouldest that such things should 
not befall thee, thou must stand in fear, relying not on 
thy skill and wisdom, but on the words and promise of 
Christ [Matt. 10:19. f.], "When therefore they shall deliver 
you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for 
it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For 
it is not you who speak, but it is your Father's Spirit who 
speaks through you." It is right for you to answer that you 
are well equipped with sayings from the Scriptures; but 
see to it that you do not insist on them with a proud 
courage, otherwise God will tear the right, strong saying 
out of your mouth and memory, if you were otherwise 
equipped with all sayings beforehand. Therefore fear 
belongs to it. But if thou art thus skillful, thou canst 
answer to princes and lords, and also to the devil 
himself. Only see to it that it is not man's doing, but God's 
word. 


1240 Eri. bs, 148-itio. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 3, 16-18. 


1241 





And have a good conscience, that they which 
speak evil of you, as of evildoers, may be put to 
shame, because they have reproached your good 
walk in Christ. 


St. Peter also said above that we cannot avoid it, if 
we want to cling to the gospel and Christian life, we must 
be blasphemed and condemned by the world, so that we 
are thought to be the most desperate of boys. Therefore, 
we must not allow ourselves to be challenged, but 
earnestly strive to have a good conscience, to fear God, 
and to lead an honorable life. For let the devil and all the 
world rage and rage, let them reproach as they will, they 
will have to stand with shame in the end, because they 
have reproached and blasphemed our good walk in 
Christ (which they regard as error and disobedience); 
when our innocence comes to light, then we will be safe 
and stand with a good conscience. Now these are all 
beautiful and strong sayings that can comfort us and 
make us courageous, and yet keep us in fear. 


V. 17 For it is better, if it is God's will, that you 
suffer for good than for evil. 


It will not happen that those who go to heaven have 
good days on earth, because those who do not go to 
heaven 1) may not have good days either. For it has 
ever been laid upon all men that God says to Adam, "In 
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread"; and to 
the woman, "Thou shalt bring forth children with pain." 
Since misfortune is laid upon us all, how much more 
must those bear the cross who wish to enter into eternal 
life. Therefore he says: "If God wills it so, then it is better 
that you suffer for your own good. Those who suffer for 
iniquity have an evil conscience, and therefore have 
double punishment; but Christians, because they have 
a good conscience, only suffer inwardly in their bodies, 
and inwardly they have comfort, as Christ says Jn 16:33: 
"In the world you are afraid, but in me you have peace" 
2c. 


1) Here we have deleted "the", which is too much, not even in the 
first redaction. 





But here he has set a goal: "if it is God's will"; as he 
also said above: "if it should be so"; so that the 
erroneous spirits may be warded off, as the Donatists 
were, of whom St. Augustine writes, who took such 
sayings that sound of suffering, and killed themselves, 
threw themselves into the sea 2c. God does not want us 
to seek misfortune and choose it ourselves. Go thou and 
exercise thyself in faith and love; if the cross comes, 
accept it; if it does not come, do not seek it. Therefore 
the fiery spirits do wrong to scourge and smite 
themselves, or to choke themselves, and to storm 
heaven with it. We should therefore wait for the body, so 
that it does not become horny, but also not corrupt; and 
we should suffer when another sends us suffering, but 
not choose it from ourselves. This is what the phrase 
means: "if it is God's will"; if he decrees that you should 
be persecuted for his name's sake, accept it and suffer 
it with patience, and be confident, for you are suffering 
for a good deed. 


V.18. Since Christ also once suffered for our sins, 
the righteous for the unrighteous. 


Once again, St. Peter sets the Lord Christ as an 
example for us, always referring to the suffering of 
Christ, so that we should all follow the example, lest he 
should propose a special image to each class. For as 
Christ's example is proposed to everyone in the whole 
community, so he also holds it up to everyone in the 
community, that everyone of whatever rank he is, in all 
his life, as it happens, should keep to it; and thus wants 
to say: Christ has been just, has also suffered for our 
sake who were unjust; but has not sought the cross, but 
waited until it was God's will that he should drink the cup; 
he should be our example, whom we should follow. And 
especially St. Peter introduces the example here, so that 
he now wants to conclude, after he has instructed all 
classes, and will now further transfigure the suffering of 
Christ. 

But actually he says here: "Christ once suffered for 
us", that is, he took upon himself the sin of all the world 
and bore it, 


1242 en. 52, 150-152. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1243 





But he did not die for every sin separately, but once he 
was enough for all of them. In this way he has redeemed 
from their sins all those who come to him and believe in 
him, so that they are now masters over sin and death, 
just as he is. 

The righteous for the unrighteous" (he says), as if to 
say: "We should suffer much more, because we suffer 
for the sake of the righteous, who has no sin; but he died 
for the unrighteous, that he might be sufficient for their 
sin. 


That he might offer us to God. 


All this is said to show the quality of Christ's suffering, 
namely, that He did not die for His own sake, but that He 
sacrificed Himself to God for us. How does this work? 
Did he not sacrifice himself? Answer: It is true that he 
sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us who believe 
in him; but in the same way he also sacrificed us with 
him, so that all who believe in him must also suffer and 
be killed with him according to the flesh, just as he was. 
Thus God has presented us as those who are alive in 
the spirit, yet die in the flesh; as he says afterwards. So 
then we are one sacrifice with him: as he dies, so we 
also die according to the flesh; as he lives spiritually, so 
we also live in the spirit. 


And is dead according to the flesh, but made alive 
according to the Spirit. 

The word flesh is common in Scripture, as is also 
spirit, and the apostles commonly hold the two in 
opposition to each other. Now if this is the opinion that 
Christ through his suffering was taken from the life that 
is flesh and blood; as a man on earth, living in flesh and 
blood, walks and stands, eats, drinks, sleeps, wakes, 
sees, hears, grasps and feels, and recently what the 
body does, which is perishable, to this Christ died. This 
is what St. Paul calls COFDUS animale, that is, as an 
animal lives, in the flesh, not according to the flesh, that 
is, 1) in natural works which the body has; to such life he 
died, so that it ceased with him, and he is now set in 
another life. Therefore he says that he was made alive 
according to the Spirit, that is, he was made alive in the 
flesh. 


1) "that is," is missing in the Wittenberg. 





enter into a spiritual and supernatural life, which fully 
comprehends the life that Christ now has in soul and 
body, so that he no longer has a fleshly body, but a 
spiritual body. This is how St. Paul expresses it. 

So shall it be with us in the last day: we shall become 
spiritual men out of natural men, that is, my body and 
yours shall live without eating and drinking, shall not 
beget children, nor digest, nor cast out, and such like, but 
shall live inwardly according to the Spirit, and the body 
shall be transfigured as the sun is now, and much more 
clearly; shall not be natural flesh and blood, neither shall 
it do natural works, nor works of the flesh, such as 
animals have in common with us. St. Paul also speaks of 
this in 1 Cor. 15:45: "The first man Adam was made in 
the natural life, and the last Adam in the spiritual life"; 
item, v. 49: "As we have borne the image of the earthly, 
so shall we bear the image of the heavenly." From Adam 
we have all natural works, like the unreasoning 2) 
animals according to the five senses; but Christ is 
spiritually flesh and blood, not according to outward 
senses, sleeping not, waking not, yet knowing all things, 
and being in all things. So shall we be also, for he is the 
firstfruits of spiritual life, that is, he is the first that is risen, 
and come into spiritual life. So Christ now lives according 
to the Spirit, that is, he is truly man, but has a spiritual 
body. 

Therefore, the words here are not to be taken as 
separating the spirit from the flesh, but that the body and 
flesh are spiritual, and the spirit is in the body and with 
the body. For St. Peter does not mean here that the Holy 
Spirit raised Christ, but 3) in general, as when | say: "the 
Spirit", "the flesh", 4) | do not mean the Holy Spirit, but 
the inward things which the Spirit does, and which come 
from the Spirit. Follows now: 

V. 19, 20: In the same he went and preached to the 
spirits in prison who did not believe.

1245 





This is a strange text and a darker saying than there 
is in the New Testament, so that | do not yet know for 
sure what St. Peter means. First, the words read as if 
Christ had preached to the spirits, that is, to the souls 
that did not believe when Noah built the ark. | do not 
understand this, nor can | interpret it; no one has 
interpreted it yet. But if someone wants to believe that 
Christ, after he died on the cross, came down to the souls 
and preached to them, | will not refuse. So it would like 
to suffer a mind; but | do not know whether St. Peter 
wants to say that. 

The words may well give such an idea that the Lord 
Christ, after he ascended into heaven, came in the spirit 
and preached, but in such a way that his preaching was 
not bodily. For he speaketh not with a bodily voice, 
neither doeth he any more that which is the natural work 
of the body. Therefore, just as it sounds that he preached 
to the spirits in the same spiritual life, so such preaching 
must also be spiritual preaching, which he does inwardly 
in the heart and soul, so that he may not go with the body 
and preach orally. The text does not say that when he 
died he went down to the souls and preached to them. 
For it says, "in the same," that is, when he was put to 
death according to the flesh and made alive according to 
the Spirit, that is, when he had given up being in the flesh 
and the natural works of the body, and had entered into 
a spiritual being and life, as he is now in heaven, he went 
and preached. Now he has never again gone to hell, after 
he has taken on such a new nature: therefore it must be 
understood that he did this after the resurrection. 

Because the words want to imply that it is said of 
spiritual preaching, we want to stay on the sense that St. 
Peter speaks 1) of the ministry that Christ does through 
outward preaching. For he commanded the apostles to 
preach the gospel bodily; but apart from the preaching 
he himself comes and is also present spiritually, 
speaking and preaching. 


1) "rede" is missing in the Wittenberger. 





He preaches into the hearts of the people, as the 
apostles speak the words orally and bodily into the ears. 
There he preaches to the spirits that are imprisoned in 
the prison of the devil, so that the going is also to be 
understood spiritually like the preaching. 

But that here follows: "To the spirits that believed not" 
2c., we want to interpret according to the divine account, 
that in the being, since Christ is inside, are equal before 
him, who were before times, and are now. For his 
regiment extends both over the dead and the living. And 
in that life the beginning, the middle and the end of the 
world is in one lump. But here in the world there is a 
measure, that time goes on one after another, the Son 
after the Father, and so on. As that we give a likeness: If 
a log lies far from you, or if you look at it lengthwise, you 
cannot see it; but if it lies close to you, or if you stand on 
top of it and look at it lengthwise, you can see it. So on 
earth we cannot comprehend this life; for it is always from 
foot to foot one after the other, until the last day, but 
before God it is all in a moment. For before Him a 
thousand years are as one day, Ps. 90, 4. 2 Petr. 3, 8. 
Thus the first man is just as near to Him as he who is to 
be born at the last, and sees it all at the same time, as 
the eye of man can bring two things together in a 
moment, which are also far from each other. Let it be 
understood, then, that Christ no longer preaches in the 
flesh, but is present with the Word, and preaches to the 
spirits spiritually in the heart. But do not understand that 
he preaches to all spirits. To which spirits did he preach? 
To those "who did not believe". There is the figure that is 
called synecdoche, ex parte totum, the 
is not the same as them, but the same as them, and just 
as unbelieving as them. Therefore, one must look from 
this life into that life. 

This is now the best understanding, as | think, of these 
words of St. Peter, but | do not want to fight too hard 
about it. But | cannot well believe that Christ went down 
to the souls and preached to them there; so the Scripture 
is also against it, and says: Who 


1246 Erl. 52, 155-157. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1247 





The one who does not believe has already been judged, | Christ, there is certainly a Christian church, where 


so that each one may receive what he has believed and 
lived. For this reason, since it is not certain what will 
happen to the dead, the saying cannot be interpreted in 
this way. But it is certain that Christ is present and 
preaches into the heart, where a preacher preaches the 
word of God into the ear; therefore we can draw it 
without hesitation. But to whom better understanding is 
revealed, let him follow it. Now this is the sum of the 
understanding | have shown: Christ went to heaven and 
preached to the spirits, that is, to the souls of men, 
among whom the souls of men were unbelievers in the 
days of Noah. Now follow on: 


Since God once waited and had patience in the 
days of Noah, when the ark was prepared, in which 
few, that is, eight souls were kept by the water. 


But St. Peter wants to lead us into the Scriptures so 
that we can study them, and gives a likeness of the Ark 
of Noah, and interprets the same figure. For it is nice to 
introduce parables with such images; as St. Paul does 
when he speaks of the two sons of Abraha and two 
wives, Sarah and Hagar, Gal. 4, 22. ff, and Christ Joh. 
3, 14. of the serpent that Moses had set up in the desert. 
Such parables can be well understood and are also 
amusing; that is why St. Peter also introduces this one, 
so that faith can be summarized in a physical image. He 
wants to say: As it happened when Noah prepared the 
ark, so it will happen here. Just as he was preserved in 
the box that floated in the middle of the water, so you 
also must be saved in baptism. The water of that time 
drowned all living things, both man and beast: so 
baptism also drowns all that is carnal and natural, and 
makes spiritual men. But we ship in the box, which 
signifies the Lord Christ, or the Christian church, or the 
gospel which Christ preaches, or the body of Christ, to 
which we cling by faith, and are saved, as Noah was in 
the ark. So you see how the picture summarizes what is 
faith and the cross, life and death. Now where there are 
people who believe in 


everything that comes from Adam and that is evil is 
drowned. 


V. 21. Which therefore also makes us blessed in 
baptism, which is signified by that, not the putting 
away of filthiness of the flesh, but the covenant of a 
good conscience with God. 


You are not kept and saved by washing the filth from 
the flesh, that the body may be clean, as the Jews did; 
such cleanliness is no longer valid, but the covenant of 
a good conscience with God, that is, that you feel in 
yourself a good, happy conscience, which is in covenant 
with God and can say: He has promised me grace and 
forgiveness of sins through Christ; | accept this with joy 
and do not doubt that he will keep it for me, for he cannot 
lie. So if you hang on his word and cling to it, you must 
be preserved. Now the covenant to keep us is faith, 
which takes hold of God's promise and holds fast to it; 
not an outward work that you can do. 


Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 


St. Peter adds this so that he may glorify the faith that 
is based on the fact that Christ died, descended to hell, 
and rose from the dead. If he had remained dead, we 
would not have been helped; but because he is risen 
again, sits at the right hand of God, and proclaims to us 
that [we], if we believe in him, have a covenant with God, 
1) and a certain promise of eternal life and blessedness, 
so that we will be kept, like Noah in the ark. So St. Peter 
made the ark entirely spiritual, since there is not flesh 
and blood inside, but a good conscience toward God, 
which 2) is faith. 


V. 22. Who has ascended to the right hand of God 
in heaven, and the angels and the mighty and the 
powers are subject to him. 


He says all this for the transfiguration and 
strengthening of our faith. For Christ has

covenant with GOD."

and help all powers that are in heaven and earth, even 
death and the devil, as all things must serve and be at 
the feet of the Lord Christ. This is now the third chapter; 
the fourth follows. 


must also go to heaven and become lords over all 
creatures, and where there is a power, that he also led 
us there and made us lords. Now this is said to us for 
comfort, that we know that we must be served by 


The fourth chapter. 


V. 1. Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the 
flesh, arm yourselves with the same mind. For he who 
suffers in the flesh ceases from sins 2c. 

St. Peter still remains on one track. As he has hitherto 
admonished us in general that we should suffer if it is 
God's will, and has set Christ as an example for us, so 
he now confirms this further and brings it up again; thus 
he wants to say: Since Christ suffered in the flesh, who 
is our duke and head, and set an example for all of us 
that he has redeemed us through his suffering, we 
should follow him, and also equip ourselves and put on 
such armor. 

For in the Scriptures the life of the Lord Christ, and 
especially his suffering, is held out to us in two ways: 
first, as a gift, as St. Peter did in the first and second 
chapters, first building and teaching faith, that we are 
redeemed by the blood of Christ and our sins are taken 
away, and how he is given and bestowed upon us, which 
cannot be grasped in any other way than by faith. Of this 
also he hath said in the third chapter, saying, "Christ hath 
once suffered for our sins." This is the main and the best 
part of the Gospel. Secondly, Christ is presented and 
given to us as an example and model to follow. For if we 
now have Christ by faith for a gift, we are to go on and 
also do as he does to us, and follow him in all life and 
suffering. This is how St. Peter presents it here. But here 
he does not speak primarily of the works of love, so that 
we may serve our neighbor and do good, which are 
actually called good works (for he has said enough about 
them above), but of 





such works as concern our bodies and serve ourselves, 
so that faith may be strengthened to put to death sin in 
the flesh, and so that we may serve our neighbor all the 
better. For if | keep my body in check so that it does not 
become lustful, | can also leave my neighbor his wife or 
child in peace. So, if | curb hatred and envy, | will be all 
the more skilled to be pleasant and friendly to my 
neighbor. 2c. 

Now we have often said that even though we are 
justified by faith without works and receive the Lord 
Christ for our own, works do not remain outside, but 
certainly follow faith; for faith does not celebrate, but 
serves the neighbor through love, and fights against the 
remaining sins and lusts in the flesh until death. For we 
are not made completely clean by living on earth; each 
one still finds sin and evil lusts in his body. Faith begins 
to take hold of Christ and to kill sin, but it is not yet strong 
and perfect, as it should be; as the Gospel teaches about 
the man who fell among robbers, who stripped him and 
beat him, went away and left him half-dead. He was not 
yet healed, but was bound and accepted by the 
Samaritan to be healed. So it is here also: When we 
believe, our sin, that is, the damage we brought from 
Adam, is bound up and begins to heal; but this happens 
in one more, in the other less, according to whether the 
faith is strong or weak. Therefore, when we have come 
to faith, let this be our deed henceforth, because we live, 
to sweep out sin completely, and to serve one another 
through love. Therefore says St. Peter: 


1250 en. 52, iss.isi. Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1251 





Arm yourselves with the same mind, that is, make a firm 
resolution, and strengthen your hearts with the mind you 
receive from Christ. For he who is in earnest will of 
course say, "My Lord Christ suffered for me, shed his 
blood, and died an ignominious death on the cross for 
my sake; why should | not also suffer if it is his will? If the 
Lord takes the lead in the fight, how much more shall the 
servants go forth with joy? So let us gain courage, that 
we may penetrate and arm ourselves, that 1) we may go 
through joyfully. 

The word "flesh" in the Scriptures does not only mean 
the body, since flesh and blood, bone and skin are on, 
but everything that comes from Adam; when God speaks 
Gen. 6, 3: "Men will no longer let my spirit punish them, 
for they are flesh"; and Isa. 40, 5: "All flesh will see that 
the mouth of the Lord speaks", that is, it will be revealed 
before all men. So we also confess in faith: | believe that 
there is a resurrection of the flesh, that is, that all men 
will rise again. So "flesh" means man through and 
through, as he lives here in this life. Now the works of the 
flesh are told in detail in Gal. 5:19, not only the gross 
vices, which are well known to everyone, as adultery, 
fornication, uncleanness, 2c., but also the spiritual vices, 
as idolatry and heresy, which are not only in the flesh but 
in the mind. Therefore it must be understood that man 
with reason and will, inwardly and outwardly, with body 
and soul, is called flesh, therefore that he seeks with all 
his powers outwardly and inwardly only what is carnal, 
and what is good for the flesh. 

So St. Peter also says here that Christ suffered in the 
flesh. Now it is certain that his suffering extended further 
than into the flesh alone; for his soul suffered the greatest 
hardship, as the prophet Isaiah says, Cap. 53, 11. So 
also understand that which follows here: "He that 
suffereth in the flesh ceaseth to be found." For this does 
not only extend to cutting off one's head. 


1) Wittenberger: thereby. In the first redaction: "thereby". 





and tears the body, but on everything that may hurt the 
person, what he suffers for misery and hardship. For 
there are many people who have healthy bodies, and yet 
inwardly feel much heartache and misery. If it is done for 
Christ's sake, it is useful and good. For "he who suffers 
in the flesh (he says) ceases from sins. For this purpose 
the holy cross is good, that sin may be subdued 
therewith; if it thus appeals to thee, the tickling, envy, 
hatred, wrath, and other sins pass away from thee; 
therefore God has laid the holy cross upon us, that it may 
drive and compel us to flee to Christ, and to seek mercy 
and help of him, and to reach out one hand to another. 
Therefore follows: 


V. 2: That he may live henceforth, which is still in 
the flesh, not according to the lusts of men, but 
according to the will of God. 


From now on, as long as we are on earth, we are to 
take the flesh captive through the cross and suffering and 
force it so that we do not live like the unbelievers in the 
world, who know nothing about God and ask nothing 
about His word, living there without any fear of God in 
their airs as if it would last forever and God would never 
have judgment and punish their sin; But we are now to 
lead an honorable, holy life as God's children, and to do 
so with all earnestness, which our heavenly Father 
desires, not that we can earn anything by it, for Christ 
has acquired the eternal inheritance for us without any 
merit or effort on our part, but that God may be praised 
by it, and the neighbor served. 


For it is enough that we have spent the past time 
of life according to the will of the Gentiles, walking in 
lust, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, drunkenness and 
abominable idolatries. 


We have already done too much, that before we 
came to faith, we spent our lives so shamefully according 
to the pagan will, in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, 
gluttony, drunkenness and abominable idolatries. He 
lists some of the vices in which the savage, crude people 
live; now they are common out of all measure, not only 
among the papists, who blaspheme and persecute the 
gospel, but also among the pagans. 


1252 en. 52, 161-163. Second edit. Sermon on | Petr. 4, 3-7. 


1253 





even among those who want to be praised as lovers of 
it. But St. Peter says that where such vices are rampant 
among people, they are called whatever they want, that 
this is an indication that they do not fear God, have no 
right faith, no love, no patience 2c., but because they all 
drive their wills, live according to their lusts 2c., that they 
are still drowned in abominable idolatry 2c. 

V. 4. 5. They are disconcerted, lest ye run with 
them into the same desolate, unclean things, and 
blaspheme; which shall give account unto him that is 
ready to judge the quick and the dead. 

This is: You have hitherto lived paganly in 
abominable idolatry and shameful sins and vices, as | 
have said; but because you have now departed from 
them, it is strange to the heathen, and seems strange 
and wondrous to them, that you now express yourselves 
of the same former disorderly nature which you had in 
common with them, and never together with them 
blaspheme God's word and those who believe in it, and 
say: How great fools they are, that they turn away from 
all the joys and pleasures of this life 2c. But let them 
think it strange and still blaspheme; they will have to give 
an account of it. Therefore command ye him that is 
ready to judge the living and the dead. 

For to this end the gospel was preached even to 
those who are dead, that they might be judged 
according to the flesh, but live in the Spirit. 

But this is a strange, whimsical text. The words 
clearly say that the gospel is not only preached to the 
living, but also 1) to the dead; and yet they add that they 
are judged according to the flesh. Now they have not 
flesh; therefore it cannot be understood as of the living. 
It is a strange speech, which it is; whether the text comes 
to us completely, or whether something has fallen out, | 
do not know. But | understand it thus: One must not 
worry how God will condemn the Gentiles who died 
many hundred years ago, but who are alive now; 


therefore it is said of men on earth. 
1) "also" is missing in. the Wittenberg. 





But you must understand the word "flesh" in the same 
way as | said above, that the whole man is called flesh, 
as he lives; as he is also called whole spirit, when he 
strives for that which is spiritual. Now this is mixed 
together, as | speak of a man who is wounded, that he is 
whole and yet wounded, so that the healthy part is 
greater than the wounded part; but he alone is called 
wounded according to the part in which he is wounded; 
so here also the spirit is to proceed. Therefore he says 
that they are condemned according to their outward 
nature, but according to their inward nature, that is, 
according to the spirit, they are kept and live. 

But how is it possible that he says that they are alive, 
and yet he says that they are dead? According to my 
understanding, | will interpret it this way, but | will also 
not set a goal for the Holy Spirit to call the unbelievers 
dead. For | cannot accept the idea that the gospel should 
be preached to the dead and deceased, unless St. Peter 
means that the gospel should be preached to the dead 
and deceased. Peter means that the gospel went out 
freely and resounded everywhere, and was not hidden 
from the dead or the living, from angels or devils, not 
preached secretly in a corner, but so publicly that all 
creatures, if they had ears, might have heard it, as Christ 
commanded in the last chapter, "Go into all the world and 
preach the gospel to all creatures." So when it is 
preached, it finds people who are condemned according 
to the flesh, but live according to the Spirit. 


V. 7. But the end of all things is at hand. 


This is also a strange speech. It is now almost a 
thousand and five hundred years that St. Peter 
preached; that is not a near or short time; nor does he 
say that the end of all things is near, and is already here. 
St. John, 1 John 2:18, calls it "the last hour." If the apostle 
did not say it, one would say that it was a lie; but now 
one must firmly hold that the apostle is true. But what he 
means by this he will himself say in the other epistle, 
where he tells why the time is called near, and says: "A 
day is as dew before the Lord.

send years, and a thousand years as one day"; of which 
is also said above. 


V. 8. Be therefore temperate and sober unto 
prayer. 

Here he exhorts them to prayer, indicating that it is 
the duty of every Christian to pray, because the spirit of 
grace and prayer has been poured out on the faithful, 
Zach. 12:10; therefore he that prayeth not, let him not 
think that he is a Christian. True Christians pray without 
ceasing, for their hearts, being where they are and doing 
what they want, are always filled with such thoughts: Oh, 
dear Father, give grace that your name may be sanctified 
in all the world through the preaching of the Gospel, that 
many may be converted, pious and blessed through it, 
that not the devil's will, not the will of the evil world, but 
your gracious, fatherly will be done 2c. Nevertheless, 
they also pray with their mouths, both at home and in 
church, when the congregation comes together to hear 
God's word and to receive the holy sacrament, and when 
they pray for all the needs of all Christendom, and give 
thanks spiritually and physically for the benefits they 
have received. But if the prayer is to be heartfelt and 
earnest, the prayers must be moderate and sober; for he 
who is a drunkard is good for nothing else. How then 
should he fight against the devil with faith and earnest 
prayer, yes, such a one is already devoured by him. 

"Moderate" refers to abundance in vestments, 
clothing, ornaments and all kinds of splendor, so that 
they may keep themselves modest and respectable, as 
befits Christians; "sober" refers to eating and drinking for 
necessity, so that the body may have its abstinence and 
may carry out its business, item, so that the soul may 
also be brave and skillful in acting and contemplating 
God's word, and in praying with earnestness. We must 
eat and drink, therefore God also gives sun and rain, 
makes grain, wine and all kinds of fruit grow, so that we 
may enjoy it with thanksgiving. But indulgence with 
eating and drinking is forbidden. Luc. 21, 34. Christ says: 
"Beware lest your hearts be weighed down with gluttony 
and drunkenness, and with cares of food" 2c. St. Paul, 
Gal. 5, 21, counts eating and drinking among the 
following 


the works of the flesh, saying, "Those who do these 
things will not inherit the kingdom of God." 

So then, St. Peter says: "I faithfully exhort you to be 
moderate and sober, for you are a people called to a 
state in which you must fight without ceasing against sin 
and against the god of this world, the devil, who is your 
adversary, who goes about you and is more greedy for 
your souls than a hungry wolf for a sheep. To resist this, 
1) you must truly not be secure nor asleep, but be 
temperate and sober and armed with prayer and spiritual 
weapons, Eph. 6. There would be much to preach about 
this, for we Germans are even drowned in this shameful 
vice of indulgence 2c. 


Above all, have fervent love for one another, for 
love covers the multitude of sins. 


For your own part, be temperate and sober, that you 
may pray rightly and earnestly; after this, look to those 
around whom you are and live with them, that you may 
love them with all your heart. The apostles used this word 
diligently. Rom. 12, 9. St. Paul says that love is not false. 
1 John 3:18: "Little children, let us not love one another 
in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth"; and Cap. 
1:23 above: "Love one another fervently out of a pure 
heart." For everyone complains about the false people, 
of whom the world is always full, who pretend to be 
friendly with words and gestures, but do not mean it with 
the heart, as the saying goes: Good words and nothing 
behind them; item: Beware of the cats, who lick in front 
and scratch behind. And such cats can cover their 
mischievousness very well, even adorn it, so that they 
think, even if they act so deceitfully, that they have good 
reason and right. God knows, they say, that | begrudge 
him all good things, and would also like to suffer that [it] 
would go according to all his wishes, and where | also 
know how to help him with body and goods, | shall not be 
lacking. But he is too wicked, ungrateful 2c., that if one 
shows him so much good, everything is in vain and lost 
in him 2c. 


1) In the original: "to be entitled against". 


1256 en. 52, 166-168. Second edition. Sermon on | Petr. 4, 8. 9. 


This is a false, deceitful love, which even the worst 
boys on earth have. But you Christians, St. Peter wants 
to say, should have a righteous love, which does not 
glow and shine like a boggart, and yet is hypocrisy at the 
bottom, but which has a heat and fire with it, which burns 
from the heart, which is such a noble virtue that it does 
not let itself be embittered, does not think evil, but bears 
all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures 
all things 2c., 1 Cor. 13, 4. ff, and as St. Peter speaks 
here, which covers not one, two, ten, twenty, a hundred 
2c. Sins covers, but the multitude of sins. For if a man 
love one rightly, and mean him earnestly and faithfully, 
he cannot do so wickedly, he would have it to his credit. 
He may well be angry with him and punish his sin and 
bad behavior, according to the words of Christ Matth. 18, 
15. ff: "If your brother sins against you," 2c. But he 
cannot be his, unless he is a public blasohemer and 
persecutor of his word; of whom the prophet Psalm 
139:22 says: "| hate them in all seriousness" 2c. 

A pious father loves his son with all his heart; but if 
he is wicked and disobedient, the more he loves him, the 
more severely he punishes him with words, even 
chastising him, so that the blood will flow afterwards, not 
out of enmity, or that he has a desire for it and wants to 
strangle him, but that it hurts him that he does not want 
to be pious; nevertheless, he considers him his dear son 
and heir, and his father's heart remains toward him, 
even though he may act differently with words and 
gestures. So even a pious mother, even if she has a 
shabby and unkind 1) child, does not throw him away 
because of this, nor will she be unkind to him, but cares 
for him more, has greater care, trouble and work with 
him than with the others at all. She does not like the 
sores and bruises, but because it is her child, love blinds 
her, so that even the bad sores do not have to be bad, 
but have the name, so that the child will be fine and fresh 
after it. If it looks bad, it must be called sweet-skinned; if 
it is black, it must be brown 2c. Thus she can not only 
cover the infirmities of her child, but also adorn it. 

This is how it should be among us Christians. 


1) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "netted". 





1257 


It is never lacking, you do and speak at times something 
that upsets me, | on the other hand, in which you have 
no pleasure; as in the body one limb injures the other, 
the teeth bite into the tongue, the fingers grasp into the 
eyes 2c., and yet does not happen out of intent. Then we 
should keep to St. Peter's teaching, not only bear one 
another's burdens, cover their faults and infirmities, but 
also excuse and adorn them, as St. Paul also teaches in 
1 Corinthians 12:26: "The members that seem to us to 
be the most dishonest, to them we give the most honor, 
and those that seem to us to be evil, to them we adorn 
the most" 2c. 

This saying, which St. Peter drew from Solomon's 
Proverbs, chap. 10, 12, has been interpreted as if it were 
meant to sound against faith; therefore the adversaries 
reproach us with it, saying: "You teach that faith alone 
makes one pious, and that no one can be freed from sin 
by works; why then do Solomon and St. Peter speak 
here? Love covers sin? Answer: He who has hatred for 
another, says Solomon, does not cease from strife and 
quarreling; but where there is love, it also covers sin and 
forgives gladly. He who holds anger is an unhappy man, 
does not allow himself to be reconciled, remains full of 
anger and hatred; again, a man who is full of love cannot 
be angered, no matter how much he is harmed, he 
covers everything up and acts as if he did not see it, so 
that the covering up is said against the neighbor, not 
against God. No one should and can cover your sin 
before God except the faith that holds Christ, who loved 
you and gave himself up for you; but my neighbor's sin 
covers my love. Just as God covers my sin with His love 
when | believe in Christ, so | should also cover my 
neighbor's sin with my love. 


V. 9. Be hospitable among yourselves, without 
murmuring. 


2) At the same time, the apostles and disciples of 
Christ went through all countries and kingdoms, 
preaching the gospel in all the nations.

interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1259 





Wherever they went, they were strangers and 
sojourners, having nothing of their own, as Christ had 
commanded them not to take anything with them on their 
journey, but to be careful and anxious to do their duty 
well. For wherever they went, they would find people 
who would listen to them, accept them, and give them 
food and other necessities, for a laborer is worthy of his 
food. From this also comes this exhortation of St. Peter 
that Christians should be hospitable to one another, but 
especially gladly receive those who let their house and 
yard be open to them, let them eat and drink with them, 
and show all kindness to those who are teachers of the 
gospel, even to other poor brethren who are driven into 
misery because of the confession of faith; and they 
should do this without murmuring, that is, with joy and 
gladly from the heart, for the sake of Christ, who is 
received in such people, Matth. 10:40; that therefore to 
lodge gladly and to be hospitable is also one of the 
virtues that should shine among Christians; but as 
strange as Christians are, so is this virtue. 

Now St. Peter comes into the church, speaks of the 
gifts of the Holy Spirit, so that Christianity may be 
adorned, thereby serving and helping not the body but 
the soul, and says: 


V. 10. And serve one another, each with the gift he 
has received, as good stewards of the many graces of 
God. 


The world, what gifts it has, be it wisdom, art, 
understanding, power, honor, goods, etc., does not think 
otherwise, it has them from itself, does not believe that it 
has received them from God; therefore it defies them, 
needs them only for its own benefit, does not serve its 
neighbor with them, yes, wants to be highly honored and 
celebrated by those who do not have them. On the other 
hand, St. Peter here teaches us Christians that all 
goods, bodily or spiritual, that we have are gifts from 
God, which he gives us so that one may serve the other 
with them, and the more one receives from him, the 
more he has to charge him. This is what he means when 
he says above, "Have a fervent love for one another," 
proving that you are hospitable to one another; and here, 
"Serve one another, each with the gift, 








which he has received" 2c.As if to say: "You have gifts 
that are not innate to you, nor did you bring them as your 
own inheritance from your mother's womb, but you 
received them from God, not that you should blow 
yourselves up for their sake, 1) be held great and 
glorious by others, but that you should be God's faithful 
stewards, making good use of the various gifts that He 
has adorned you with, namely, for His praise, honor and 
glory, and for your neighbor's benefit and salvation. 

St. Peter speaks here mainly of the spiritual gifts, of 
which the world knows nothing, and asks nothing about 
them (for it alone cares how it fills the belly 2c.). The Holy 
Spirit pours these out abundantly on his Christians, 
adorns and decorates them with them; gives one to 
speak of wisdom through the Spirit, another of 
knowledge 2c., 1 Cor. 12, 4, ff. Rom. 12, 6. Therefore let 
those who have such gifts, especially if they are 
commanded to teach the church of God and to feed it 
with the pure word, see to it that they use them as St. 
Peter teaches here, namely, to faithfully serve those over 
whom they preside, so that they may come to the right 
knowledge and faith of Christ through them and be 
saved. St. Paul 1 Cor. 12, when he speaks of such gifts 
for a long time, finally strikes with a mighty thunder and 
speaks 1 Cor. 13, 1. ff: If any man, even he, could speak 
with the tongues of men and of angels, and prophesy, 
and know all mysteries and knowledge, and have all 
faith, that he might remove mountains, and give all his 
substance to the poor, and be burned, and not have love, 
he is nothing. 

This is truly a very hard thing to say and a terrible 
thing to hear, that a man should be a fine, excellent, 
learned man, having many beautiful spiritual gifts, well 
taught and experienced in the Scriptures, and also well 
eloquent and teachable, so that he can present it finely 
to others, so that they can understand it well, grasp it and 
keep it well; and yet nothing should help him, but with all 
this glorious adornment, even if he were once so great 
and glorious, he should be nothing and lost. How does 
this happen? St. Pau-

1261 





lus interprets himself, saying: If he does not have love, 
that is, if he exalts himself with such gifts as if they had 
grown on him and he had not received them, he makes 
an idol out of them, seeks only his benefit, how he may 
come to great honors and high status by being carried 
on the hands and worshipped for the sake of his high 
intellect and skill; asks nothing about where God's honor 
and the neighbor's benefit and salvation remain. 

These are peevish people, but they are very mean in 
the world, especially among preachers. As soon as a 
man feels that he is able to do something before another, 
that he is able to teach, that he has a fine voice, and that 
he can easily get away from him, he takes it upon 
himself, becomes proud, despises the others who do not 
do the same, and even makes himself believe that he 
knows better than those from whom he has learned; 
immediately a pupil becomes a master who wants to do 
it before anyone else in the world. When the mob falls 
upon him, praises and extols his skill (as such spirits 
strive for it with all their diligence), this first soothes him 
and tickles him that he does not know whether he is 
walking on the earth or on the clouds. These do the 
greatest harm in Christianity; what pious, righteous 
teachers have done well and planted and built for a long 
time with great effort and work, they break and destroy 
in a short time, and yet their thing is considered better 
and holier than the other, must also have the name, as if 
they sought God's honor and the neighbor's salvation. 
2c. 

The apostles had a lot to do 1) with such shameful 
people, that is why they exhort so faithfully that one 
needs the spiritual gifts 2c. But it did not help. How was 
St. Paul? When he had preached for a long time, and 
with great care and driving had now and then built 
churches, and had hardly turned his back, the false 
brethren were soon after him, promising his person and 
doctrine, were well-talked-of and skilful people and of 
greater reputation than St. Paul; thus they misled the 
people and made them dislike him, as one can well see 
in his epistles 2c. Therefore he also speaks so 
vehemently against such ambitious spirits, saying: If 


1) "much" is missing in the Wittenberg’. 





Even if they once had such beautiful gifts, if it were 
possible, spoke with the tongues of angels, knew all the 
prophecy, knowledge and secrets of the Scriptures, and 
raised the dead, they are still of the devil, as they go and 
stand; just as Christ passes a terrible judgment on such, 
when he says Matth. 7:23: "Depart from me, ye workers 
lof iniquity; | never knew you," when they had preached in 
his name, cast out devils, and done many deeds; and 
Matt. 11:19: He complains that wisdom must be justified 
by her children. 

Therefore, this is a necessary exhortation that St. 
Peter gives here, that each one, as skillful and learned as 
he may be, use the gifts he has received so that the body 
lof Christ, that is, his congregation, may be edified by 
them; for to whom much is given, much will be sought 2c. 
so that in all things, as he says afterwards, God may be 
glorified through Jesus Christ. Whoever then preaches 
God's word purely, without all addition of human doctrine, 
that God out of pure love gave His only begotten Son 
Jesus Christ for the sin of the cursed world 2c., seeks not 
his own glory but God's, not how He may rule over you, 
but serves you with His gift, showing you how you should 
be rid of your sin and be saved 2c. Whoever does the 
lopposition seeks his honor and benefit, as is the nature 
and characteristic of all saints of works 2c. Here it would 
also be good to say about the bodily gifts, how one should 
use them properly; but it is too long here, also elsewhere 
it is often dealt with. 


V. 11: If anyone speaks, he speaks it as the word 
of God. 


He divides the gifts into two parts, speaking and 
doing; for all the works of those who have an office in the 
church are comprised in the two parts: speaking and 
doing; thus he who is a steward in the church of God 
either speaks or does something, sometimes he does 
both. If he speaks, he sees to it that he speaks God's 
word. Here both the teachers and the hearers are bound, 
that these should speak nothing in the church, those 
should hear nothing, but God's word. Because here is not 
acted as one country and people, 


1262 en. ss, 178-17s. Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1263 





How to govern, build and plant a house and farm 2c. but 
how to get rid of sin, obtain God's grace and become 
blessed, how God is disposed towards us 2c. No jurist, 
philosopher, work saint, nor the pope will teach you this 
from his canons, for no one has ever seen God. But if 1) 
you want to know it, you must learn it from the gospel of 
Christ, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has 
proclaimed the Father's will to us in his word. Therefore 
whoever is called to speak in the church, that is, to 
preach, teach, and exhort, let him speak what Christ has 
spoken and commanded to be spoken in the matter of 
salvation. He says that he is the good shepherd who lays 
down his life for the sheep and gives them eternal life; 
that if anyone keeps his word, he will not see death 
forever. He is the resurrection and the life; he who 
believes in him, though he die, yet shall he live. He is the 
way, the truth and the life, so that no one comes to the 
Father except through him. But to the apostles he speaks 
Matth. 28, 19. that they should teach all nations 
everything that he had commanded them 2c., namely, as 
St. Lucas speaks, preach repentance and forgiveness of 
sins in his name; and St. Marcus: "Whoever believes and 
is baptized" 2c. Where the teaching goes, both preacher 
and hearer are sure that the latter soeak God's word, the 
latter hear the same. There the sheep of Christ hear his 
voice, and if they believe, it happens to them according 
to his word. But if the teaching is different, and proposes 
a different means of getting rid of sin than through Christ, 
it is already wrong. For the teachers do not speak God's 
word, neither do the hearers hear it; therefore their faith 
is not right, they cannot be freed from sin, nor be saved 
2c. 


If a man has an office, to do it, as from the wealth 
that God gives. 


That is, whoever rules in the Christian church, has an 
office or ministry to care for souls, he should not go as 
he pleases, saying, | am Lord, | must be obeyed; what | 
create, 2) that shall be done. 


1) Wittenberger and Erlanger: "Shall. 
2) create - order, command. 


be. No, God wants it so that one should do nothing in the 
church, for He has commanded and commanded it, so 
that it is God's work and order. Therefore, no one should 
do anything unless he is sure that God is doing it, that it 
is God's word or work; and that is why: because God does 
not want anyone to think that what he is doing with the 
Christian church is a joke. Therefore, we must stand in 
such certainty that God speaks and works in us, and our 
faith can thus say: "What | have said and done, God has 
done and said; so that | also die on it. Otherwise, if | am 
not sure of the matter, then my faith stands on an evil 
foundation, then the devil pulls me away. 

Therefore, he who baptizes, administers the 
sacrament, absolves. 2c. does not do it out of his own 
power, otherwise he blasphemes and defiles God, but out 
of the ability of him who commanded it, saying: "Go into 
all the world and preach the gospel to all creatures. St. 
Paul also says in 1 Cor. 11 that he did not institute the 
Lord's Supper, but that the Lord was the first instigator of 
it, from whom he received it and gave it to them. So also, 
if | lay hands on someone and give him absolution, | do it 
according to Christ's word, as he says Matth. 18, 18: 
"Truly | say to you: Whatever you loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven. "2c. So now St. Peter wants that one 
should speak nothing in the church, except the word of 
God, and do nothing, because he has commanded and 
ordered it. 

Therefore, it is seriously forbidden to accept the 
commandment of any man, whether he be a pope or a 
bishop, unless one is sure that God does what he does, 
and can say: | have God's word and commandment. If 
this is not the case, he should be considered a liar. For 
God has decreed that our conscience should stand on a 
rock. This is what is said of the common rule of the 
church, that no one should follow his own conceit in it, 
and do nothing unless he is sure that God will have it. 
From this you can see how St. Peter has so long before 
pushed the Pabst's regiment to the ground, as it is doing 
now. Hold it against this saying: "If someone speaks, if 
someone has an office" 2c., then you will find that [it] is 
not at all 


1264 Erl. $2, 175-177. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 


4, 11.12. 1265 





has been reversed. Neither the word of God nor the work 
of God remained in the right use, but was most horribly 
reversed, and the poor people were led astray by the 
teachings of men and their own works 2c. Follows: 


That in all things God may be glorified through 
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power forever 
and ever. Amen. 


This is the end of the song. Everything that is done in 
the church, both in speech and deed, must be directed 
toward praising God in all things, and this through Jesus 
Christ. This happens when God's unspeakable grace 
and mercy are proclaimed through the Gospel, which He 
has shown us in Christ Jesus, whom He made to be sin 
for us, so that in Him we might have the righteousness 
that is valid before God. Where this is recognized, God 
alone is praised and glorified, as the one who out of pure 
fatherly grace, without any action on our part, has given 
such a precious treasure for our sin 2c. This is the true 
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving that is pleasing to 
God, but that it is made through Jesus Christ; for without 
and apart from Him, God is not pleased with our prayer 
or thanksgiving. 

With the words of St. Peter: "To whom be honor and 
power from everlasting to everlasting," he indicates that 
Christ is true God; for he ascribes to him the very thing 
that he ascribes to the Father, namely divine honor and 
power, which he has from everlasting to everlasting; 
which he would not do if Christ were not true God. 
Otherwise it would mean to rob God of His honor, which 
He cannot suffer, as He speaks through Isaiah, Is. 42, 8: 
"I will not give My honor to another." 


V. 12. Beloved, do not let the heat that comes upon 
you alienate you, so that you are tempted as if 
something strange were happening to you. 

But this is a way of speaking, not common in our 
language. But St. Peter needs the same speech to 


remind us of what the Scriptures say, which speak of 
suffering as being like an oven full of fire and heat. 





In the first chapter, v. 8, he said: "That your faith may be 
found righteous, and much more precious than the gold 
that perishes, which is tried by fire. So also one reads in 
the prophet Isaiah Cap. 48:10, where God says: "I will 
choose you in the furnace of misery"; and Ps. 17:3: "You 
purify me, and find nothing"; item, Ps. 26:2: "Test me, O 
Lord, and try me; purify my kidneys and my heart"; item, 
Ps. 66:10, 12: "God, you have tried us and purified us 
as silver is purified; we have come into fire and water." 
So it is the custom of Scripture to call suffering a heat or 
fire; for it burns and hurts the old Adam out of measure. 
Here St. Peter agrees that we should not let ourselves 
be alienated or think ourselves strange and weird, as if 
the heat or blaze should not happen to us, by which we 
are tempted, as if gold were melted in the fire. 

When faith is challenged, God does not let it go, but 
sends the holy cross on our backs to strengthen us and 
make the faith in us strong. The holy gospel is a powerful 
word, but it cannot come to its work without challenge, 
and no one realizes that it has such power except those 
who taste it. Where there is suffering and the cross, it 
can prove and exercise its power. It is a word of life; 
therefore it must exercise its power in death. If there is 
no death and dying, it can do nothing, and no one can 
see that it does such virtue and is stronger than sin and 
death. That is why he says: "That God has decreed that 
you shall meet with heat, that is, with various 
misfortunes and sufferings, do not let this seem strange 
to you, for it is for your own good that you, having been 
tried and tested, hold fast to His word. Therefore, it is 
written in the Book of Wisdom, Cap. 10, 12, about Jacob, 
that wisdom, that is, God's word, gave him victory in a 
strong battle, that he might learn how divine wisdom is 
stronger than all things. This is the reason why God lays 
out the Cross to all believers, so that they may taste and 
try the power of God, which they have grasped through 
faith.

V. 13. But rejoice that you suffer with Christ. 


Do not be surprised, he wants to say, that you have 
to suffer a lot, do not be unwilling and sad about it, as if 
your God has forgotten and left you, but take it as a sure 
sign of his fatherly will towards you, because whom he 
loves he chastises and chastises every son whom he 
receives. This he has well proved in Jesus Christ, his 
only begotten Son, and has made him a curse 2c. 
Therefore rejoice that you have come to glory, and that 
you are now conformed to the likeness of Christ, 
following in his footsteps, and suffering with him; and it 
shall be well rewarded you, as he further saith: 


That you may also have joy and gladness at the 
time of the revelation of his glory. 


In the first chapter above, v. 6 f., he speaks of such 
things, saying: "You are now for a little while (when it 
shall be) sorrowful in many temptations, that your faith 
may be found righteous and more precious 2c. when 
now Jesus Christ is revealed" 2c. Here he adds 
something about his glory, which will be revealed in that 
day, which will be unspeakable and incomprehensible, 
of which we will have eternal joy and delight, against 
which all suffering, as St. Paul says in Romans 8:18, 
which we may encounter in this life, is nothing at all. 
Whoever grasps this, no suffering is too hard for him, as 
one reads of many martyrs 2), both male and female, 
who went cheerfully to the torture as if they were going 
to a good life. So also the apostles went cheerfully from 
the council's presence, thanking God that they had been 
worthy to suffer shame for Christ's name's sake, Apost. 
5, 41. 


V. 14. Blessed are you when you are reviled above 
the name of Christ. 

As if he were to say, "This is the reason for 
everything; if you do not believe and confess this name, 
the world will also love you and 


1) "not" is missing in the Wittenberger. 2) Wittenberger: "Martern”. 


There is no more hostile name on earth than Jesus 
Christ; not that one could not call him or hear him called, 
yes, the worst and most bitter enemies of this name lead 
and praise him most of all, calling themselves the 
Christian church and God's people, but they blasoheme 
and condemn us as heretics and the worst enemies of 
God. Why? Because we do not let this name remain a 
bad name, written with empty letters, like mine and 
yours, but believe, preach and confess that the person 
called Jesus Christ is, according to his name, the only 
Savior of the world, who saves from sins, the only High 
Priest, who reconciles sinners with God, the only Lord 
and King, who helps from all fear and distress, and that 
only those who recognize him as such, redeemed from 
sin, death, 2c., attain grace and eternal blessedness. 
This is unpleasant to them. They grant him the name, 
that he shall be called Jesus Christ, as | Martinus; but 
that he shall lead him in deed, as the angel indicates 
Matth. 1, 21: "He shall be called Jesus, for he shall save 
his people from their sins", and Luc. 2, 10. f., where the 
angel says to the shepherds, "Fear not; behold, | 
proclaim to you great joy, which shall be to all the 
people: for unto you is born this day a Saviour, which is 
Christ the Lord." 2c.: Before they admit it, they condemn 
his word, persecuting and strangling as heretics those 
who teach and confess it; and if they had him, they 
would have crucified him one more time. For if they 
allowed this, they would have to confess that 
monasticism, human righteousness, chosen works and 
worship 2c. do not save from sins, attain grace and 
eternal life 2c. But this they will well leave undone. 
Therefore the name JEsus Christ is with them in the 
reason of the truth a hostile and cursed name. For he 
that speaketh not by the Spirit of God, saith St. Paul 1 
Cor. 12:3, curseth JEsum; and again, "No man can call 
JEsum a Lord, except it be by the Holy Ghost." Dear, do 
not let him be to me a bad doctor of the holy Scriptures, 
who can rightly call the name Jesus Christ, if he has not 
otherwise written or read many books 2c.

1269 





For the Spirit, who is the Spirit of glory and of 
God, rests upon you. With them he is blasphemed, but 
with you he is praised. 

You have, he says, with you the Spirit of God, which 
is a Spirit of glory, for he does not make you glorious in 
the sight of the world, but in the sight of God, for which 
reason your glory is still hidden; but when Christ's glory 
is revealed, it will come in daylight and have no end. Here 
we see that the Holy Spirit is especially given to 
transfigure and glorify, just as He transfigured and 
glorified Christ. 

Now this same Spirit (he says) rests on you, because 
you are children through Christ, confess his name, and 
suffer persecution for his sake. He, not you, is 
blasphemed in you by them, because what he does and 
says in and through you, the devil must have done and 
said. Therefore, do not accept blasphemy; it attacks the 
Spirit, who is the Spirit of glory; do not worry, you are 
gloriously honored enough. If that rests upon you, even 
in that day shall your glory be made manifest before all 
the world 2c. This is the comfort we Christians have, that 
we can say: The word is not mine, faith is not mine, all 
that | have is God's gift and work: therefore he that 
blasphemeth me blasphemeth him that hath given me all 
these things: as Christ saith, Luc. 10:16, He that 
despiseth you despiseth me 2c. 

Therefore, St. Peter wants to say: Know that the spirit 
you have is so strong that it will punish your enemies; as 
God also says in Exodus 23:22: "If you will obey my 
commandments, | will be an enemy to your enemies"; 
and the Scriptures indicate many times that the enemies 
of God's people are the enemies of God. Now if we are 
reviled because we are Christians and believe, we are 
not reviled, but the reviling is actually against God 
Himself. Therefore he says: "Be of good cheer, for this 
happens to the spirit that is not yours, but God's. Further 
he adds a warning: 

V. 15. 16. But let no one among you suffer as a 
murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or one who takes 
hold of a foreign office. But if he suffer as a Christian, 
let him not be ashamed, but let him honor God in such 
a case. 


So he wants to say: You have heard how you have to 
suffer and how you should keep yourselves in it; but see 
to it that you suffer as Christians who suffer for the sake 
of charity and righteousness, as he also said Cap. 3:14, 
not as murderers, thieves, evildoers, or those who are 
subject to something they are not commanded to do, but 
as the spirit of a mob, who, under the appearance of 
truth, preach lies and error and stir up sedition, who 
suffer for the sake of their evil deeds. 

But if you suffer as Christians, you should not be 1) 
ashamed, but praise God that you are worthy to suffer 
shame for the sake of His word and name. He makes 
suffering and torture very glorious and precious, so that 
it is such a wonderful thing, for which we should praise 
God when it comes to us that we should suffer in this 
way; just as Christ does in Matt. 5:12, where He says: 
"Blessed are you when men revile and persecute you for 
my sake, and say all kinds of evil against you, when they 
lie about it. Be glad and of good cheer, for you will be well 
rewarded in heaven" 2c. 


V. 17 For it is time for judgment to begin against 
the house of God. But first of all, what will be the end 
of those who do not believe in the gospel of God? 


Here he touches two prophetic sayings at once. First, 
the prophet Jeremiah, Cap. 25, 29, thus: "Behold, | 
began to afflict in the city that is called by my name," that 
is, | first punish my dearest children who believe in me; 
they must be held up before all others and be led into the 
fire, "and you" who do not believe in me, who are my 
enemies, "should go unpunished" ? And Cap. 49, 12. He 
says: "Behold, those who were not guilty of drinking the 
cup must drink it; and you should go unpunished? Thou 
shalt not go unpunished, but thou must drink also." That 
is: | smite my beloved, that thou mayest see what | will 
do to the enemies. See what words these are: the greater 
the saints God has, the more shamefully he lets them 
perish; what will become of those who blaspheme his 
word and persecute his saints? So also Ezek. 9, 6. 


1) "not" is missing in the Erlanger. 


1270 Erl. 5s, 182-184. interpretations on the 1st epistle St, 


The prophet saw some men in armor with their 
murderous weapons, who were to kill everyone, to 
whom God said: "Attack my sanctuary. This is what St. 
Peter means here. Therefore he says, "The time is here, 
as the prophets have said, that judgment must begin 
upon us. When the Gospel is preached, God starts and 
punishes sin, killing and making alive. He strikes the 
pious with the tail of the fox, and is first of all the 
motherwort. But what will happen to those who do not 
believe? As if he should say: If he is so serious with his 
dear children, you can well calculate what kind of 
punishment will come upon the unbelievers 2c. 


V. 18. And if the righteous is hardly preserved, 
where will the wicked and the sinner appear? 


This saying is also taken from the Book of Proverbs, 
Cap. Il, 34, where Solomon says, "If the righteous must 
suffer on earth, how much more the wicked and the 
sinner?" Now St. Peter has often thought of the suffering 
and affliction which Christians have in this life; for they 
are not only persecuted by the world, but the devil also 
terrifies them in the heart, holds sin against them, and 
makes them great, so that they fall into sadness and 
gloom: are thus both afflicted outwardly with persecution 
and contempt, and inwardly with trembling and terror. 
Then the world cannot judge them otherwise than that 
they are damned people who have neither comfort nor 
help from God; indeed, they themselves do not allow 
themselves to think otherwise, because they feel such 
sadness and melancholy of spirit, that God is angry with 
them and has abandoned them. Therefore 


1271 


Peter. 


comes the miserable lamentation in the Psalms [Ps. 31, 
23]: "| am cast out of your sight" 2c. This is what St. Peter 
means when he says: "The righteous can hardly be 
preserved, for even if he believes and holds fast to God's 
promise, it is hard and laborious for him to get through 
and be saved, for the devil makes it sour and hot enough 
for him: where then will the wicked and sinner remain? 
So if God gives faith a push so that it wriggles, how can 
he stay and stand who is not only without faith, but also 
despises God's word and counsel and blasphemes His 
saints. Therefore, he resolves upon it: 


V. 19. Therefore, those who suffer according to 
God's will should commend their souls to Him, as to 
the faithful Creator, in good works. 


That is, to whom God sends a suffering that they did 
not seek and choose themselves, they should command 
their souls to Him. They do well, remain in good works, 
do not turn away for the sake of suffering, entrust 
themselves to their Creator, who is faithful. This is a great 
comfort to us. God created your soul without all your 
worries and efforts when you were still nothing; he will 
also keep it well for you; therefore trust him with it, but in 
such a way that it will be done with good works, so that 
you will not become impatient, sad and angry, and desire 
to take revenge on those who harm you, nor grumble 
against God, punish him with lies, and fall into despair; 
But hold fast on both sides, forgive your enemies, and 
pray for them, and give glory to God, that he may be 
merciful, true and faithful, and not forsake you in all 
distress, but will graciously help you out, though it may 
feel otherwise with you. 





The fifth chapter. 


V. 1. I exhort the elders who are among you, fellow 
elders and witnesses of the sufferings that are in 
Christ, and partakers of the glory that is to be 
revealed. 

In the fourth chapter above, St. Peter has given an 
instruction on how to keep the 


who preside over the people in spiritual government, 
that no one should teach or preach anything unless he 
is sure that it is the word of God, so that our conscience 
may stand on a firm rock. For it is bound up with us 
Christians that we should be sure of what we preach.

therefore he also calls himself an elder. And here St. 
Peter humbles himself; he does not say that he is a ruler 
although he would have had power, because he was a 
apostle of Christ; and he does not call himself only 
fellow elder, 


Christ, the arch-shepherd, has many shepherds 
under him, and he has handed out his flock to them, 
which is scattered over the face of the whole earth. What 
shall they do? They shall feed his flock. The pope has 
taken this text upon himself, and wants to 


1274 en. 52, 186-188. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


1275 





prove that he is overlord, and may deal with the sheep 
as he pleases. But it is well known what pasture means, 
namely, that the shepherds give pasture to the sheep 
and present fodder, so that they may grow fat, strong 
and fruitful; above that they also look lest the wolves 
come and tear the sheep; it is called feeding the sheep, 
not slaughtering and strangling them. But he speaks of 
spiritual feeding, which is done by the pure word of God 
2c. 

So St. Peter actually calls it Christ's army; as if he 
should say: Just do not think that the army is yours, you 
are only servants of it. So he also said above Cap. 2, 25: 
"You are now converted to the bishop and shepherd of 
your souls." And Apost. 20, 28. St. Paul says to the 
elders: "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and unto 
all the host, among whom the Holy Ghost hath made you 
bishops, to feed the congregation of God, which he hath 
purchased by his own blood" 2c. So then the bishops are 
servants of Christ, to shepherd His flock and to feed it. 
But to feed is not, as has been said, but to preach the 
Gospel, so that the sheep may feed on the Gospel and 
the Word of God, from which they are fed and become 
fat and fruitful. So also Christ says to St. Peter, "Feed my 
sheep," that is, the sheep you are to feed are not yours, 
but mine. Those who do this are elders or bishops, even 
if they are only poor village priests; but those who do not 
are not bishops before God. 2c. 

Whether these sayings are bright and clear enough, 
and 1) cannot be understood otherwise than from 
spiritual pasture, nor have they interpreted them 2) to the 
effect that the pope has external authority over all of 
Christendom, and yet none of them preaches a word of 
the Gospel; | fear that in St. Peter's time there were very 
few popes who preached the Gospel. St. Gregory, the 
pope, has certainly been a holy man, but his sermons 
are not worth a penny; so that it seems that the chair at 
Rome is especially cursed by God. Many popes have 
been martyred for the sake of the Gospel. 


1) "and" is missing in the Erlanger. 
2) "they" is missing in the Wittenberger. 





But there is nothing written of them that is special, in 
which they have taught faith in Christ. 2c. Nevertheless 
they go on, saying and writing that they must feed, and 
yet do nothing, except that they catch and torture the 
consciences with their own laws, preach nothing of 
Christ; all they have to do is that by this and such 
sayings, which speak of feeding, the tyranny of the pope 
may be confirmed, that he is the highest lord on earth. 
But let them always go, there is no hearing. 

From St. Peter's words (when he says: "Feed the 
flock of Christ" 2c.) it is well to be understood that he 
speaks to those who feed the flock of Christ with the 
Gospel; those who are able to teach others should be 
chosen for this office, as St. Paul also says to Timothy [2 
Tim. 2:2]: "What you have heard from me, command 
faithful men who are able to teach others also." But a 
preacher must not only feed, that is, preach the gospel 
purely to the sheep of Christ and instruct them how to be 
true Christians, but he must also ward off the wolves so 
that they do not attack the sheep, introduce error and 
lead them astray with false teaching, just as the devil 
does not rest. Now there are many people who may well 
suffer the gospel to be preached, but that they cry not 
against the wolves. But though | preach rightly, and feed 
and teach the sheep well, yet am | not rightly 
shepherding the sheep, and keeping them, lest the 
wolves come and lead them away again. For what is it 
built, if | cast out stones, 3) and watch another throw 
them in again? The wolf can well suffer that the sheep 
have good pasture; he has them the better that they are 
hostile; but he cannot suffer that the dogs bark hostilely. 
Therefore it is a great thing who takes it to heart that one 
should feed rightly, as God has commanded. Both must 
be together; as St. Paul also teaches Titus 1:9: "An 
elder," he says, "should hold to the word that is sure and 
able to teach, that he may be mighty to exhort by sound 
doctrine, and to punish the gainsayers." 


3) About the reading: "eject" compare Col. 1101. 


1276 en. ss, 188-181. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 5, 2. 


The flock (says St. Peter) that is among or with you, 
or that is commanded to you, not that you should be 
masters over it, but that you should feed it, that is, 
instruct, comfort and admonish it with God's word, how 
to believe, love, live Christianly, and grow and increase 
in the knowledge of Christ 2c. 


And look at them. 


The Greek word émytyomobvtes, which is, 
are bishops, which St. Peter here needs, comes from the 


little word émiayomoc, which means on 

German ein Aufseher oder Wachter, der auf der Wache 
oder auf der Warte liegt, und um sich herumsehen, dass 
es Uberall richtig zugehehen; deshalb Bischof und 
Aeltester Ein Ding ist. It is therefore a lie that they now 
say that the office of bishop is a dignity or rule, and that 
he is a bishop who wears a pointed hat on his head 2c. 
It is not a dignity or a rule, but an office, that he should 
visit those who are commanded to him, that he should 
look after them, and be their watchman, that he may 
know what faults, deficiencies, and infirmities are 
everywhere among them; where one is weak and has an 
evil conscience, that he may help and comfort; where 
one falls, that he may straighten him out; where one is 
wild, that he may punish him, and the like; so that by 
such his faithfulness and diligence the Christian people 
may be sufficiently provided for. Therefore he says, 
"Look at the flock," as if to say, "You are not commanded 
to feed geese or cows, but the community of God, which 
he purchased with his own blood," Acts 20:28. 20, 28. 
Therefore watch carefully, you will have to give an 
account for them. That is why | have often said that if 
there were a proper government now, there would have 
to be three or four bishops in a city, after which it is, who 
would provide the community with God's word and have 
respect where it is lacking everywhere. 


Not compelled, but voluntary. 


Here St. Peter touches two things, which might 
frighten someone to preside over the people. In the first 
place, there are some who are devout, and yet they do 
not like to be used as pastors and preachers, for it is a 
laborious office to see how the sheep live everywhere, 
to help them and to guide them. 





1277 


and night, and prevent wolves from entering; for this 
purpose one must also stake life and limb on it. 
Therefore he speaks: You shall not be forced to do it. It 
is true that no one should enter this office without being 
called; but if he is called and required, he should go 
willingly and do what his office requires. For those who 
are compelled to do it, who have no desire and love for 
it, will not do it well. Therefore he says, "Not compelled," 
that is, unwillingly, unenthusiastically, and 
discontentedly, as those who alone consider the toil and 
labor and displeasure, even driving, but voluntarily, to 
the praise of Christ, whose servant and steward they 
are, and to the benefit and salvation of the people whom 
they are commanded. 


Not for the sake of shameful gain. 


The others are worse than the first, who preside over 
the people, and seek their profit in feeding their bellies. 
These seek the wool and milk of the sheep, asking 
nothing of how they are fed, as our bishops are now 
doing. Now this is almost an injurious and abominable 
lamentation; for if he who is to feed is thus bent on his 
own use and greedy for gain, he will soon become a wolf. 
That is why both apostles, St. Peter and Paul, often 
reported it, and also the prophets. Ezk. 34, 2. 3. is written 
like this: "Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed 
themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock? 
But ye eat the fat, and clothe yourselves with the wool, 
and slay that which is fattened; but ye will not feed the 
sheep" 2c. 


But out of good will. 


This is that a pastor has a desire for it, is inclined to 
it, and does it gladly from the heart, remains happy to 
teach, even in poverty and lack, completely free of 
charge, because he knows that he does God good in it, 
and shows his neighbor the highest good deeds. He 
does not seek his own glory in the feeding of God, nor 
his own profit and benefit from the sheep he is 
commanded to feed, as Moses, Samuel and all pious 
shepherds have done and still do. 2c. So we have two 
kinds of evil shepherds: the first, who do not like to do it, 
shunning the work, ingratitude and the cross; the 
second, who do not like to do it, shunning the work, 
ingratitude and the cross.

do as they please. For we have one Lord, who is Christ, 
who rules our souls. The bishops shall do nothing but 
feed. 

Then St. Peter overturned with one word and 
condemned all the rule that the pope now leads, and 
clearly concludes that he and his bishops have no power 
to command a word, but that they alone should be 
servants and say: This is what your Lord Christ says, 
therefore you should do it. For thus Christ teaches Luc. 
22, 25. f.: "The worldly kings reign, and the mighty are 
called gracious lords; but ye not so, but the greatest 
among you shall be as the youngest, and the chiefest as 
a servant." And St. Paul 2 Cor. 4:5: "We preach not 
ourselves, but JESUS Christ, that he is the LORD; but we 
your servants for JESUS' sake." The Pope, however, has 
it the other way around, does not only want to be Lord 
over God's people, but also blasohemes the Majesties 
2c. 


But become models of the herd. 


That is, think that you step in front and lead such a 
holy way, that you give a good example to the people with 
your life, which they follow. O! how unequal are our 
nobles 2) to those elders or bishops of whom St. Peter 
speaks here: They are tyrants more than pastors, 
binding, as Christ says, heavy and infallible burdens, and 
laying them on the poor afflicted consciences; but they do 
not stir the same with a finger, if they should not preach 
a word, nor do they preach a word, if they should not 
preach a word.

diligently feed Christ's flock, which you have been 
commanded to do. This is the admonition that St. Peter 
gives to those who are to care for souls. From this you 
can strongly conclude and clearly prove that the pope 
with his bishops is the end-Christ or anti-Christ; since he 
who does none of what St. Peter demands here, does not 
feed Christ's flock, not to mention that he should do it 
willingly and from the bottom of his heart and be an 
example to it in faith, love, spirit, etc., but rather does 
exactly the opposite, but he does exactly the opposite, 
and not only does not want to feed the herd nor let it feed, 
nor does he want to be master over it himself, doing 
everything for the sake of shameful gain, but he himself 
is the wolf that tears it apart, and yet he boasts that he is 
the Lord Christ's governor. 4) He is the wolf that tears it 
apart, and yet he boasts that he is the Lord Christ's 
governor. Now, as he is a steward, so shall he be 
rewarded. 

Therefore it is necessary for the simple to grasp this 
and similar sayings well, and to hold the pope's rule 
against them when they are asked and examined, so that 
they can answer and say, "Thus Christ said and did," and 
the pope teaches and acts contrary to this. Christ says 
yes; the pope says no. Because they are against each 
other, one of them must lie. Now Christ does not lie; 
therefore | conclude that the pope is a liar and the right 
end-Christian. So you must be equipped with the 
Scriptures, so that you can not only call the pope an end- 
Christian, but also know how to prove it clearly,

that you may surely die on it, and stand against the devil 
in death. Now follow on: 


V. 5. In the same way, you young people, 
be subject to the elders. 


These are the last admonitions in this epistle. St. 
Peter wants to have such an order in Christianity, that 
the young should be subject to the old, honor them and 
humble themselves before them; as it is also written: 
"Before a gray head you shall rise, and honor the old. If 
this were the case, there would not be much law. He 
wants to have it straight so that the youth should be 
governed according to the understanding of the 
ancients, as they know best, that it may be done to the 
praise of God. For he speaks here of such old men as 
are learned, understanding, and enlightened with the 
Holy Spirit. For if they themselves are fools, and 
understand nothing, no good government comes of it; 
but if they are wise and experienced, it is good that they 
govern the youth. But St. Peter does not yet speak of 
worldly government, but in general that the elders 
should govern the young in spirit, be they priests or other 
old men. 

Nevertheless, it is a common doctrine that affects all 
people, regardless of their status. Now it is a common 
complaint that the youth is rough, wild and naughty: 
children do not want to be subject to 1) their parents, 
pupils to their preceptors, servants to masters and 
wives; there is no more obedience and discipline among 
the young people, but only pride and wantonness; 
everyone wants to do what he desires, to be a squire, 2) 
to be free and unpunished. God will not allow this to 
continue. Now whoever wants to be a Christian, and let 
him be told, know that it is not up to him whether he 
wants to be a subject or not, but he should do it with 
goodness and will. God wills it, who speaks here through 
St. Peter: "Young people, be subject to the elders. 

Moreover, Christ is set before you as an example, 
that you should be like him. Wel- 

Erlanger: the. é tama 2" 

re The comma after "Junker" (which the Erlangen edition, vol. 52, 


4 (incorrectly paginated "192"4) has omitted) is found in the 


ittenberg edition. Buchwald, Elf ungedruckte Predigten, p. 37, 


offers: "Jedermann will Junker Frei fein.” 


Although he was in divine form and equal to God, he 
became the servant of all of us and was obedient to 
death, even death on the cross, Phil. 2, 6-8. And above 
Cap. 2, 18. the apostle exhorts the servants not only to 
be subject and to prove all loyalty even to their whimsical 
masters, but also to suffer ingratitude and all evil from 
them, and to follow in the footsteps of their Lord Christ, 
who has done no sin 2c. If then you despise the 
commandment of God, your Creator, and do not let the 
example of Christ your Lord and Savior move you, you 
are not a Christian, you have lost your baptism, Christ's 
suffering and blood, God's grace and mercy, yes, you are 
incurring God's severe and unmistakable wrath and 
disgrace; which, as St. Peter says afterwards, is the 
hope of the world. He will overthrow and exterminate you 
poor maggot with his mighty hand, so that he will also 
cast the disobedient angels into hell with chains of 
darkness; as one not only reads this in all histories, but 
also experiences it daily. | fear that the disobedience and 
courage of the young people will soon be punished more 
horribly than anyone thinks; God will first take away His 
own in mercy, so that they may not see such misery. 


All of you be subject to one another, and hold fast 
to humility. 

Here he restrains himself and moderates his words, 
wanting all Christians to be submissive to one another. 
But how does this rhyme, if the elders are to rule, and yet 
at the same time also be submissive? Should it be 
reversed? We want to let the words remain, so that they 
are said in general to all Christians, that one should be 
subject to the other; the young, as said, to the elders, and 
again, the elders (especially when they are in office) to 
the young, that is, to be ready to serve them with their 
gifts, spiritually and physically, every hour and moment, 
if need requires it, as, with comfort, advice, admonition, 
help, punishment 2c.For this reason also, because both 
old and young have the same spiritual goods, the young 
just the word of grace, faith, baptism, hope, spirit, Christ, 
God, life, blessedness, as the old.

have. There is no difference at all, neither old nor young, 
but all are one in Christ. Therefore, he who is a Christian 
with all his heart, who is gifted with the highest gifts and 
is the teacher of others, humbles himself even against 
the least Christian; for he belongs to Christ as much as 
he does, and has bought him as dearly as he has bought 
him; indeed, he not only bears the infirmities and 
burdens of the weak, but also covers them up; that is, in 
fact, to serve and to be subject. Also, one often finds 
young people who are more skillful and more highly 
gifted by God than old people. That is why St. Peter 
wants us to be subjects of one another. 

St. Paul also teaches Rom. 12, 10: "One should 
precede the other with reverence, and Phil. 2, 3: 
"Through humility respect one another more highly than 
yourselves"; item, Christ Luc. 14, 8-10.If you are invited 
to a wedding, do not sit on top, lest someone more 
honest than you be invited by him; and if he who invited 
you and you who invited him comes, say to you, 'Move 
away from him,' and you will have to sit with shame on 
the bottom; but if you are invited, go and sit on the 
bottom, so that when he who invited you comes, he may 
say to you, 'Friend, move up. Upon this he introduces the 
saying, as elsewhere more [v. 11.] "He that exalteth 
himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself 
shall be exalted." 

For this reason the young should be subject to the 
elders, but nevertheless the elders should be so skilled 
that each one considers himself the least in his heart. If 
this were done, we would have good peace and 
prosperity on earth. 


Hold fast to humility. For God resists the proud, 
but gives grace to the humble. 


God distributes His gifts among the people of His 
pleasure, adorning some with bodily gifts, such as 
health, strength, beauty, wealth, honor, power 2c., some 
with spiritual gifts, such as wisdom, understanding of the 
Holy Scriptures 2c., and this, as was also said above, so 
that 


1) Erlanger: ebenwohl. 





They should recognize that they have received such gifts 
from him, thank him for them and use them for the 
benefit of their neighbor. This is what St. Peter teaches 
here when he says, "Hold fast to humility," and it is a 
serious and necessary teaching. For it is no different in 
the world: if someone has something before another, he 
boasts, becomes hopeful and proud; as if he were rich, 
noble, powerful, beautiful 2c., item, learned, eloquent, 
pious 2c. does not think that he has it from God, let alone 
that he should thank him for it, much less that he should 
serve and advise his neighbor with it; but thinks it has 
grown on him, for this reason thinks much of himself, no 
one is good enough for him, yes, others stink before him; 
thus he needs what he has only for the contempt and 
harm of his neighbor, and on top of that wants to be 
celebrated and worshipped by him; there is neither love 
nor humility, but only contempt and arrogance. 
Therefore such a man sins not only in the other table 
against his neighbor, but also in the first against God, 
whose grace and mercy he should preach and praise 
(for which he has been given the gifts); but he does not 
do so, but seeks his glory and honor in it. This is called 
blaspheming and desecrating God's name in the most 
horrible way. Therefore, the hopefulness that arises and 
grows from the gifts of the spirit is a devilish vice that is 
radically against God's name and word. 

But this is not how it should be among you Christians, 
says St. Peter, but you should know that God's will and 
His serious commandment is that you, as one body in 
Christ and one member of another, should have a 
fervent love, and also be one subject to the other, 
because you have the same faith, hope, baptism, spirit, 
and in sum the same goods in Christ, in whom you are 
one without any difference. But if anyone is adorned with 
beautiful, high gifts before others, let him know that he 
has received them from God for this reason, that he may 
serve those who do not have them, so that God may be 
glorified through Jesus Christ. Therefore, the more 
highly you are gifted, the more deeply you humble 
yourselves 2) even toward the least of these; but they let 
themselves be taught, instructed, corrected, 
admonished, and punished by you, 


2) "also" is missing in the Erlanger.

We also accept it with all humility, so that you tie your 
hands together and hold on to it firmly and strongly, so 
that it remains whole and round and is not torn apart and 
torn apart by anger, arrogance, disagreement and 
impatience. But this truly requires great earnestness, for 
it will not go down easily, nor will it let itself be put on like 
a skirt. Therefore he speaks further: 


V. 6. Humble yourselves therefore under the 
mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in his 
time. 


Because God wants you to submit to one another, do 
it willingly and gladly, and he will exalt you in due time. 
But if you will not do it willingly, you will have to do it; he 
will throw you down. 

But it has an appearance, when God lets His own be 
pushed down, as if He wanted to be outside too long. 
Therefore he says: Do not err in this, put it out of your 
sight, and rely on the fact that you have a certain 
assurance that it is God's hand and His will. Therefore, 
you should not look at the time, how long you humble 
yourselves and submit to others. For even if God 
forgives, He will still exalt you. 

But if you do the contrary, do not let this faithful 
admonition of mine move you, nor let Christ's spirit rule 
you, but follow the devil, who is a proud, hopeful spirit, 
and does nothing but sow hope in men's hearts, so that 
they rely on temporal goods, honor, power, wisdom, 
holiness 2c. and do not take comfort in Christ's suffering, 
do not ask about God's providence and promise: then 
you should know that you are incurring the wrath and 
enmity of God, who created you and has your life in his 
hands. He resists the hopeful who do not want to humble 
themselves under his mighty hand, he can overthrow 
you in an instant and cast you into the abyss of hell, as 
he has proven from the beginning of the world; as you 
can read not only in the Bible, but also in all histories, 
and you can see it every day before your eyes, if you 
only want to believe it. 

Mary, the holy Mother of GOD, also sings in the 
manner in her Magnificat, stroking the 


He further elaborates on St. Peter's saying and says that 
God shows His mercy to those who fear Him; item, He 
raises the lowly, feeds and fills the hungry with goods, 
and finally delivers them from all misery and makes them 
blessed. On the other hand, he scatters the proud in their 
hearts, pushes the mighty from the throne, and leaves 
the rich empty, so that they finally have to live in want 
forever, which St. Peter summarizes thus: "God resists 
the proud, but gives grace to the humble. But this is 
believed on both sides to be better. 1) The proud, the 
powerful and the rich have it all their own way and desire, 
whatever their heart desires. Therefore they do not think 
otherwise, because they have a gracious God, believe 
nothing less than that he should resist them and 
overthrow them. Again, because the pious must suffer 
much, as we have heard throughout the epistle, it is as if 
God is angry with them and resists them with all his 
might. Therefore, because it is so absurd, 2) Christians 
should not allow themselves to be challenged, but 2) 
should keep God's word and take comfort in His promise, 
as St. Peter teaches further, saying: 


V. 7 Cast all your care upon him, for he cares for 
you. 


This is a beautiful, comforting saying, which every 
Christian should well imagine and write in his heart, so 
that he can comfort himself with it against all adversity 
and temptation. If then St. Peter will say thus: If the world 
persecutes you, if the devil with his fiery darts frightens 
and saddens your heart, if false brothers prove 
wickedness and mischievousness to you, or if anything 
else, no matter what it may be, looks at you, then do not 
become angry and impatient, do not grumble and 
complain, and even if it lasts a long time, and there is no 
end to it, do not let the time be too long, but let God take 
the matter home, he will do it well. Yes, in this way we 
only give them cause to trample us underfoot, to do us all 
harm and damage, and finally to strangle us. Therefore 
do not worry about anything, let him take care of it, and 
remember the rest.

not, Where shall | get money, house, food? how shall | 
feed my wife and child? how shall | get out of this trouble 
or journey? where shall | stay when | die? but follow my 
advice: Let every man in his condition do what God has 
commanded him to do; if he encounters some evil in this, 
let him suffer it, and herewith prove his patience and 
humility, and take comfort in the fact that God, to whom 
he has now been reconciled through Christ, and through 
faith in him has become his child, is almighty and 
merciful; let him call upon Him, and cast all his concerns, 
whether bodily or spiritual, home to Him with all 
confidence, for He cares for us. We should not doubt 
this. 

The prophet David also speaks Psalm 55:23 (from 
which St. Peter introduced this saying), where he says: 
"Cast your concern upon the Lord, and he will provide 
for you (for he is too long in procrastinating, and in the 
meantime always leaves me in trouble; ei, hold fast and 
wait); he will not leave the righteous in trouble forever." 
There are many more such sayings in the Bible. 
Therefore, this teaching is nowhere to be found except 
in the Holy Scriptures; no philosopher or lawgiver 
teaches that one should cast all worry on God. That is 
why the world knows nothing about it, turns everything 
around, not only leaves it to do what it should, but also 
does not want to suffer anything. If it meets it differently 
than it had thought, it becomes angry and impatient, and 
thinks how it can avenge itself; thus, contrary to St. 
Peter's advice, it takes upon itself the care that it should 
cast upon God, which is too heavy and infallible for it. 
Therefore we see that commonly all people, especially 
people of high rank, carry themselves with worries and 
fear day and night, can never be satisfied, so they spend 
their lives miserably with futile, useless worries, and if it 
does not work out and wants to go on as they intend (as 
it commonly happens; but if it does, then it only brings 
them greater ruin), they become mad and foolish, and 
also die in part from great suffering. What is lacking? 
That they do not follow St. Peter's advice, do not cast 
their care on God, but keep it with them, and want to 
carry it themselves 2c. 

But you have such assurance, so that you may be 
sure that GOD will not forsake you, but 





1287 


will certainly take care of you. Therefore cast all your 
care upon him, and let him do it. These are sweet words 
beyond measure; how could he make it sweeter and 
kinder? But why does he need so much irritation? 
Because no one likes to let himself down and let his mind 
go. Therefore he gives such comfort that God not only 
looks after us, but also cares for us and takes care of us 
warmly. So let each one do what he is commanded to do 
by God, and if you have done it well and faithfully, and 
have earned the world's hatred and wrath with it (for they 
are not worthy of anything else), then only suffer it 
cheerfully, always continue, and do not let anything deter 
you from your profession. But if you are to be exalted, do 
not worry about it, but let God take care of it. So it is 
divided quite finely: the small things, that is, the work and 
the suffering (it cannot be otherwise), remain on you; the 
greatest things, that is, the worry, God takes upon 
Himself. Then you can get through finely, which would 
otherwise be impossible for you, if the worry would also 
remain on you 2c. At the end he still gives a faithful 
warning and says: 


V. 8, 9: Be sober and watchful, for your adversary 
the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking 
whom he may devour. Resist him firmly in faith. 


There he gives us a warning, and wants to open our 
eyes, and would be well worth that one writes the saying 
with golden letters. There you see what this life is, and 
how it is depicted, that we should probably always wish 
that we were dead. We are here in the devil's kingdom, 
no different than if a pilgrim came to a place where he 
knew that they were all robbers and murderers in the 
house; if he had to come there, he would still prepare 
himself, and provide as best he could, and not sleep 
much: so we are in the world, where the devil is so 
master that he has the hearts of men in his power, does 
through them what he wills. It is frightening, if you look 
at it right. That is why St. Peter wants to warn us to be 
careful, as a faithful apostle of Christ, who knows how 
the devil is, who he is and what his mind is. 


1288 en, 52, 202-204. Second edition. Sermon on 1 Petr. 5, 8. 9. 


1289 





But it is by nature such a malicious and poisonous 
spirit that it can suffer nothing good; it is sorry that an 
apple, cherry 2c. grows, it also hurts and upsets it that a 
few healthy people live on earth, and if God did not 
prevent it, it would throw everything into a heap. But he 
is not so bitter toward any thing as he is toward the dear 
Word; for he can hide himself among all creatures, but 
the Word exposes him, and shows everyone how black 
he is. Since you then, as St. Peter says, have God's word 
and are attached to it by faith, you should be sure that 
you have him as an enemy, and you should know that 
he is not only a wise and cunning spirit, but also a 
wicked, poisonous one, and so powerful that he is mighty 
over the whole world; therefore Christ also calls him John 
14:30, a prince, and St. Paul 2 Corinthians 4:4, 
Ephesians 6:12, a god and lord of this world. 

Now if he, your adversary, the devil, were far from 
you and left you alone, that would be a bad thing; but he 
is not. He is not a thousand miles from you, but is around 
and with you, so near that he could not be nearer to you; 
nor does he lie on a cushion, sleeping and snoring, but 
goes about day and night without ceasing; Not that he 
would jest and play with you, or see what you do, but he 
is angry and enraged, and hungrier than any wolf or lion, 
and does not seek how he may feed on yours, or do you 
any harm, or cut a wound, or give a sting, or burn house 
and home; but his whole earnestness is, 2) that he may 
devour you whole. Go around so long, seek and try 
everything, until he finally brings you to the trap; now set 
on you, and provoke you to adultery, anger, now to 
avarice, hope 2c. If it does not work that way, he tries it 
with terror, unbelief 2c. that you should leave God's word 
and despair of his grace. He can also disguise himself 
into an angel of light outside of the temptation, so that 
one does not think otherwise, because everything that 
he gives him and disputes with him from the Scriptures 
is certainly God's word and the truth, 


1) "a" is missing in the Erlanger. 
2) Erlanger: is. 


He swears and dies by it, and yet it is all falsehood and 
lies. This is how cunningly and wickedly he deals with 
you Christians, for he caught the wicked in his snares 
before, so that they must do, speak and think what he 
wants, 2 Tim. 2, 26. Peter warns us faithfully and tells us 
about our enemy, so that we should beware of him; as 
St. Paul also does, 2 Cor. 2, 11, and says: "We are not 
unaware of what Satan has in mind; and Eph. 6, 12: "We 
do not have to fight with flesh and blood" 2c. 

But especially is it to be noted here that he says, "The 
devil walks about. He does not go under your eyes when 
you are armed, but looks behind and in front, inside and 
outside, where and how he may attack you. If he attacks 
you here and now, he will soon go there and attack you 
in another place, breaking from one side to the other, and 
he will need all kinds of lift and trickery to bring you down; 
and if you are already well armed in one place, he will 
invade you in another. If he cannot overthrow you there, 
he will attack you elsewhere, and so he will never stop, 
but will go around and around, never leaving you alone. 
So we are safe, and we do not pay much attention, we 
do not walk and we do not watch, so he can tear down 
well. Therefore we are poor people, that we walk so 
carelessly. If we looked at it right, we should cry murder 
over our lives, hence Job Cap. 7, 1. calls it an eternal 
battle. Why then does God leave us in this life and 
sorrow? So that faith may be exercised and grow, and so 
that we may hurry out of this life and have a desire after 
death, and gain a desire to die. But how we are to oppose 
the devil in this life, and to resist him, is taught by St. 
Peter. Peter teaches and says: "First of all, you should 
be sober and courageous, not only in the body, but much 
more in the soul, and make every effort to ensure that the 
soul is not drunk and sleepy, but sober and courageous, 
that is, that it always breathes God's word, considers it 
and observes it, and diligently adheres to it, thanking God 
for it and praying that it may understand it better and 
more firmly adhere to it. Where this happens, the body 
remains 


1290 en. 52, 204-207. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


also fine, sober and brave, likes to go to church, listens 
to God's word, does not let anything hinder him, keeps 
himself moderate 2c.; but if the body is full, lazy and 
sluggish, it is a sure sign that the soul is spiritually drunk 
before, that is, surely, full and tired of the word, sleeps 
and snores to it. Therefore, the devil is especially 
concerned to make us spiritually drunk, so that in time 
we lose our love and desire for God's word and become 
disgusted with it, to be the preachers of it, when they 
punish us for our vices and threaten us with God's 
judgment; or else when he perverts and falsifies it 
through his preachers, but with such a pretense that 
those who hear it and are not well informed .do not know 
otherwise than that it is the true truth; as we have well 
experienced these years ago with the Sacramentarians, 
the Anabaptists, and other sects. So both the right 
doctrine and faith are lost, and there is no more 
resistance against the devil. 


V. 9: Resist firmly in faith. 


You should be sober and watchful, so that both the 
body and the soul are sent. But with this the devil is not 
yet defeated. The right sword is that you are strong and 
firm in faith. If you take hold of God's word in your heart 
and hold on to it with faith, the devil cannot win, but must 
flee. So if you can say, "This is what my God has said, 
then | will get up; then you will see that he will soon go 
away; for then, unwillingness, evil desire, anger, avarice, 
melancholy and doubting will all go away. But the devil 
is cunning and does not like to let you do this; he reaches 
out and takes the sword out of your hand. If he makes 
you lazy, so that the body becomes clumsy and the soul 
careless, does not practice God's word, does not hold 
fast to it, he soon snatches the sword out of your hand. 
This is what he did to Eve; she had God's word, and if 
she had stuck to it, she would not have fallen. But when 
the devil saw that she did not hold fast to the word, he 
tore it out of her heart; so soon it happened that she was 
deceived and brought the transgression upon the whole 
human race. 

So St. Peter's has instructed us sufficiently 


1291 


set how we shall contend with the devil. It costs not much 
running to and fro, nor any work that thou canst do, but 
no more than that thou cleave to the word by faith. When 
he comes, and wants to drive you into a melancholy 
because of sin, then only take hold of the word of grace, 
which promises forgiveness of sins through Christ, and 
consider it with all your heart, and he will soon desist. St. 
Peter continues: 


And know that your brothers in the world have 
the same suffering. 


Shortly before St. Peter denied Christ, the Lord told 
him that the devil would see him and bring him to deny 
him three times. "But |," he continues, "have prayed for 
thee, that thy faith cease not; and if thou be converted 
some day, strengthen thy brethren." What the Lord 
commanded him to do there, he does in this place 
especially, namely, comfort his brethren, that is, the 
Christians who are afflicted and challenged by the devil; 
so now | will say, | have preached to you about the devil, 
and have painted him with his right color, that he neither 
sleeps nor feasts, but watches, and goes about without 
ceasing 2c. This you will certainly learn 2c. 

Now the Christian's trials and sufferings are twofold, 
spiritual and bodily. The spiritual in the first table is the 
highest and most severe; the physical in the second is 
less and more bearable. According as they are strong or 
weak in faith, so is their suffering. Some are challenged 
with gross sins, such as fornication, anger, impatience, 
etc.; this hurts pious, Christian hearts; they would rather 
be rid of such challenges, but they do not accomplish it, 
but fight against it, killing business through the spirit of 
the flesh. But if they persist and continue in it, they are 
not Christians, even if they boast of it, and will die eternal 
death, Rom. 8:13. Some are more severely afflicted by 
the devil, that they are persecuted, chased away for the 
sake of God's word, deprived of their own, even 
murdered in part for the sake of confessing the truth; 
they suffer more severely than the first. But because 
they suffer this for the sake of a good 


1292 en. 52, so7-Lo9. Second edit. Sermon on 1 Petr. 5, 9. 


They take great comfort in suffering for the sake of 
Christ and his word. Therefore, though they suffer 
anguish and distress in their hearts, yet their hearts are 
content, and they are at ease with God through Christ. 

Above this, the devil attacks some Christians in 
particular (who are usually highly enlightened and 
experienced people) with severe spiritual temptations, 
sometimes giving them horrible, blasphemous thoughts 
in their hearts, so that they do not look at God, recognize 
or think that He is merciful, true, faithful, patient 2c. but 
think of him as the antitype, hate his judgment because 
of it, do not like his rule at all, lose both God and his 
promise, can neither pray nor call on him because of it, 
and are only angry and grumble against him. This is a 
high, dangerous and unmistakable temptation in the first 
tablet, if it should last for a while, which consumes 
marrow and bone, about which it is often lamented in the 
Psalter, the same in Job, Jeremiah 2c. | think that St. 
Peter would also have experienced a good part of it, 
since he denied Christ, and if the Lord had not prayed 
for him beforehand, and soon after the fall had 
graciously looked upon him, let peace be proclaimed to 
him, and even comforted him afterwards, he would have 
had to despair, would have perished and died in his sin, 
and would have followed Judah. 

Therefore, what he says here, he says from his own 
experience, for the comfort and strengthening of all 
Christians who suffer and are challenged; as if he 
should say: None of you who suffer and are challenged, 
bodily or spiritually, even in the highest and most terrible 
way, should think that he suffers something special, new 
and strange, or as if no one before and beside him had 
felt and endured such severe and terrible trials; no, you 
alone are not. Your suffering and affliction cannot be so 
great, heavy and strange; your brothers who live before 
and with you have experienced the same and even 
greater and more difficult things; if you do not want to 
believe it, learn it from me. | was so presumptuous that 
| not only thought to stand firm with my Lord and Master, 
even though the others all departed from him, but also 
to go with him to prison and death; | was so sure of the 
matter that | lied to the dear Lord about it. 


1293 


He told me that | would not only be angry with him that 
night along with the others, but that | would also do more 
evil than they, namely, deny him three times. What 
happened? He remained true, but with me it turned out 
that | not only became a liar and disgracefully denied 
him, but also cursed myself and swore horribly that | had 
never known him. Let this also be a suffering and a 
challenge, and only a good, strong one. 

Therefore Christ the Lord also commanded me that, 
when | am restored after my fall, | should strengthen and 
comfort my brethren; Therefore | say, as an apostle of 
Christ, as one who has a special command, and also as 
one who has experienced it myself, that no affliction or 
temptation so great, strange, and wondrous can occur 
and be encountered by you, in which you have not also 
been tempted and exercised just as you have, or even 
more severely, not only the dear children of God, your 
brothers, who have been before you from the beginning 
of the world, but also those who are now living in your 
time, scattered now and then in the world, as far as 
Christ's name is known and will be known, encounter the 
same as you encounter; for they also have the devil for 
an adversary, who goes about them, seeking to devour 
them as well as you 2c. 

Therefore, whoever is a Christian and intends to 
remain so in earnest, do not be secure, lazy or slothful, 
but be courageous, teach and practice the word 
diligently, persevere in prayer, and send himself to trial 
and suffering, knowing that he has been called to it, as 
the apostle said above Cap. 2, 21. For so says Christ 
Himself, Matth. 16, 24: "If anyone would come after Me, 
let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow 
Me"; and Joh. 16, 33: "In the world you are afraid" 2c.; 
and St. Paul, Apost. 14, 22: "We must go through much 
tribulation into the kingdom of God"; and 2 Tim. 3, 12: 
"All who would live godly in Christ JEsu must suffer 
persecution." Therefore, if it comes to pass that you are 
persecuted and suffer as a Christian, accept it as a sign 
of grace, for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and 
chastises every son whom he receives. And know that 
you do not suffer alone, but the whole Christian 
community. 


1294 en. 52, sos-211. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. Peter. 


You can't find it so strange and weird, others experience 
the same, yes, probably something higher and more 
difficult. 

What the great saints, as prophets, apostles and 
especially the patriarchs, who have lived so long, have 
endured for anguish and sorrow, that is undescribed, but 
in part briefly indicated, will also remain unthought and 
unspoken, until it will be seen in that day. Adam and Eve 
had the hardest time; they had no example before them 
to comfort them. We have the whole Scripture before us; 
there we see how it was with all the saints and with the 
head and Lord of them. This, then, in short, is the 
opinion: that we should give ourselves up to suffer here 
for a short time, and follow our Lord Christ, yet await 
eternal life and glory; not because of our suffering, but 
because it is promised by God and acquired through 
Christ 2c. 1) 

This is now the epistle; in it you have heard enough 
about what the right Christian doctrine is, how 
masterfully St. Peter has described faith, love and the 
holy cross, and how he instructs and warns us how we 
should fight with the devil. Whoever now grasps the 
epistle has without a doubt enough that he does not 
need more without God abundantly teaching just that in 
other books as well. The apostle has not forgotten 
anything that is necessary for a Christian to know. 

In the end, he does what a good preacher should do; 
he not only thinks how to feed the sheep, but also cares 
for them and pleads for them, and concludes with a 
prayer that God will give them grace and strength to 
grasp and keep the word. 

V. 10. But the God of all grace, who has called you 
to His eternal glory in Christ, the same will prepare, 
strengthen, fortify and establish you who suffer a 
little while. 

This is the desire, so that he may command them to 
GOD. God, who alone gives grace, and not one piece of 
grace, but abundantly all grace in one heap, who has 
called you through Christ, that you may have eternal 
glor-

1539 are used. Luther preached on 1 Petr. 5, 9 on July 13, 1539.

not by your own merit, but through Christ. If you have 
him, you have eternal glory and blessedness through 
faith without your merit; he who began it with you will 
also bring it on, and make it perfect for you, so that you 
may grow strong, increase, and stand firm, and so that 
you may accomplish many good things. For this purpose 
he will strengthen you 2) and establish you, that you may 
bear and suffer all things. 

V. 11: To Him be glory and power forever and 
ever. Amen. 

This is the sacrifice of praise that we Christians 
should offer to God; for since he does it all, initiates and 
leads out our salvation, gives us his dear Son without 
our merit, sends him to die for our sin, sends us the Holy 
Spirit, who strengthens and comforts us throughout our 
lives, keeps us in pure doctrine 2c., then the glory and 
praise of him who is the deed and the power is just. 
Therefore be he praised for ever and ever. Amen. Now 
he adds something to the conclusion: 

V. 12. Through your faithful brother Sylvanum 
(as I eighth) I have written you a little to exhort and 
testify that this is the right grace of God in which you 
stand. 

Although | know, he says, that you also heard it 
before, and already know well that you must not let me 
teach it to you, yet | have written this to you, that | also 
exhort you (as the right apostles should do) to continue 
in it, that you may practice and exercise it, and not think 
that | preach anything else than you have heard before.

together in Babylonia.

respect, but | do not know for sure that he means Rome, 
because it is believed that he wrote the epistle from 
Rome. Otherwise there are two Babylonia, one in 
Chaldea, the other in Egypt, where Alcayr is now. But 
Rome is not called Babylonia because spiritually, on the 
opinion, as he said above Cap. 4, 4. said, the mixture of 
the disorderly being; because Babel Hebrew means a 
mixture. So perhaps that is why he called Rome

A mixture, that there was such a disorderly being anda 
mixture of all kinds of shameful life and 
unrighteousness, and what was in all the world for 
shame, everything has flowed there. In the same (he 
says) are believers, who are chosen together with you, 
and are partakers of God's grace in Christ, who send 
you their greetings. But | will give you liberty here, that 
each one may hold and understand Babylon as he 
pleases, for there is no power in it. 


And my son Marcus. 

Hear: greet you also. It is said here that he means 
Marcum, the evangelist, and does not call him his son 
in the flesh but in the spirit, as St. Paul calls Timothy and 
Titus his sons, and tells the Corinthians that he has born 
them in Christ. 


V. 14. Greet one another with the kiss of love. 


This custom has passed away. In the Gospel it is 
clearly read that Christ received his disciples with the 
kiss, and such has been a way in the same countries. 
St. Paul also often speaks of the kiss. 


Peace be with all who are in Christ JEsu. Amen. 


That is, those who believe in Christ. This is the 
parting, that he may command them to God. So we have 
the first epistle; God grant us grace to grasp it and keep 
it, and so that we may increase in faith, hope, love, 
patience, and finally come to where St. Peter directs us 
in this epistle. Amen.

Held on Trinity Day, June 1, 1539. 


Be hospitable among yourselves without

gift he has received, as good stewards of the many 
graces of God. If anyone speaks, speak it as the word 
of God. If anyone has an office, that he may do it as 
of the ability which God has given, that in all things 
God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom

St. Peter thus preached to Christians that they should 


live moderately and soberly [1 Pet. 4:8.], and many other 
commands and precepts 





more to it. And | have said about the German gluttony, 
1) and especially that here in the city, under the 
preaching, they encourage drinking in the taverns. For if 
we were Christians and believed the word, we would 
also honor the ministry of preaching and not mock it or 
desecrate it, as is unfortunately done. We have also 
heard that Christians are not to have a bad love, but a 
fervent love that can suffer, endure and forgive, a love 
that is not in the least bit bad, but in the least bit good.

1298 Interpretations on the | Epistle of St. Peter. 1299 





Love that is red, a love that covers everything and is 
fervent, that forgives and does not keep discord o 
hatred. But if anyone does not have love, he is not 
Christian. 

"Be hospitable among’ yourselves without 
murmuring." At that time all the apostles and disciples} 
were strangers and guests. But the people became 
ungrateful, especially those who wanted to be good 
Christians. Paul also chastised the Corinthians for not 
wanting to give anything. For the apostles were poor, 
having nothing but the gospel. They did not live in thei 
own houses, as we preachers do now. Therefore, where} 
they went and preached the gospel, it could not be 
otherwise than that they lodged with the gospel with the 
people where they went, and were lodged and fed by the 
hearers. They were driven out of Jerusalem, just as 
many Christians are driven into misery in our time, 
Therefore this virtue should be with the Christians, that 
they should gladly shelter and be kind to the Christians| 
who have been driven out. But a friendly attention is 
needed, because many abuse us shamefully, especially 
the monks who have run away. The world is much worse Spirit, and yet not be saved; for he does not need to use 
now than in the apostles' time. But we should leniently| these gifts for the benefit of his neighbor, but thinks: It is 
help the poor, especially the exiles, who have a sure | alone, and others must worship me for God. And then,

Says: "Be sober!" and now comes into the church and] does not know whether he will walk on the earth or in 
into the gifts of the Holy Spirit, takes, the pieces before, the clouds. Some have a fine mind and go to them 
which go there except the hostel. For "to be sober" is 
preached from the belly and from bodily things. But this 
goes to the soul and the gifts that the body can no 
comprehend, but the soul. 

But they are all God's gifts; if you have house, farm, 
grain, wine, accept them all as God's gift. If one has 
husband, 


or a man a wife, his servants and maids, they are all 
God's gifts, if you want to look far. But | will draw it in and 
interpret it from the spiritual gifts, which belong to the 
Christian church and people's happiness. For the Holy 
Spirit pours out abundantly all kinds of gifts, so that one 
person has more than another, as is also shown in 1 
Corinthians 12 and Romans 12. For the Holy Spirit 
giveth no man all things with one another, 2) but to every 
man his own special gifts, which he shall use for the 
common good. But no one does this] except the 
apostles, who were the process 3) after them also the 
prophets [etc.]. Now the whole church should be careful 
to use the gifts for the salvation and blessedness of the 
church. But the gifts are various. But see to it that people 
are brought to serve one another with such gifts. St. Paul 
also does this. When he has long told about the gifts, he 
strikes with thunder and says that it is nothing if | had all 
the gifts and lacked love, as you can see in 1 Corinthians 
13. 

This is a wonderful sermon. For a man should be a 
learned and refined man, and have the gifts of the Holy

the trafficking 1) quickly. This tickles them and does 
them so much good that they then make sects and 
become ravening wolves, seeking only their honor, 
benefit, power and dominion. Therefore preach and 
admonish St. Paul and St. Peter, as Apost. 20, 28. and 
1 Petr. 5, 2.: "Not forced." Why do you preach this? 
Where does he see such a one teaching the people and 
[not seeking to be] 2) a lord over the people, having such 
great honor? and are [yet] 2) all pious! St. Peter sees 
well that it does not want to be this way, but this is how 
it is: When the Holy Spirit has distributed his gifts, and 
they are fine people, they cannot say, | received it, as 
St. Peter teaches; but it has grown on him. He does not 
think that they are gifts of the Holy Spirit. But | know it, 
how a great fool this one is, and even stinketh; saying, 
Here! Here is the man! They must not be God's gifts, 
since God would be praised and honored by them, but 
only for our honor, pride and avarice; not for the 
neighbor's benefit and blessedness, but for my dominion 
and for the neighbor's contempt. So also a good lawyer 
does not think: | have received this gift from God, but he 
also goes along in the clouds: Here sits the man! So 
does a doctor. But beware, lest you think you have 
received gifts and despise others. For then they will not 
consider them gifts of the Holy Spirit, but such as they 
have by their own power, and therefore they should be 
celebrated and worshipped. So does a new preacher 
who has once preached a sermon. He then despises all 
the others; if he knows a little Greek or Hebrew word, he 
thinks the whole world is full of fools against him. So we 
do not recognize the gifts we have received, but then 
trample underfoot the old people and teachers. 

This is how it is in the secular classes. A nobleman 
does not think that he has his shield, helmet and nobility 
from God, but thinks that he must therefore despise 
others and use them. He does not think that he has his 
shield, helmet and nobility from God, but thinks that he 
must despise others and use them to harm and ruin his 
country and people. So there is no aemt- 


1) By "Handel" is to be understood here the preaching, as follows 
from Col. 1260. The following also proves this. 
2) Inserted by us. 


The little one is so small, he doesn't know how to stand 
inside, so that only his dirt stinks quickly. By the body, 
that one should not serve God and benefit any city, but 
tyrannize with the gifts and thus think: | did not receive it 
from God, but it has grown on me. Thus we abuse not 
only the spiritual gifts, but also the bodily gifts. That is 
why Moses says [Deut. 32:15], "He grew fat and thick 
and strong, and forsook the God who made him." Those 
whom fortune favors, it makes fools of. If our Lord God 
gives us much, it makes fools of us. If one is rich, they 
also want to be wise. Much more one wants to be wise 
in the holy scriptures. If one understands a chapter, he 
thinks all the others are fools. 

Therefore, when the Holy Spirit distributes the gifts, 
we have no need of them. Now they are beautiful gifts 
and given to us to praise God and to benefit our 
neighbor. But we turn them around so that they are 
praised, and not for the benefit of our neighbor, but for 
harm. Shouldn't there be hellish fire, lightning and 
thunder if we misuse God's gifts, which God has given 
us for His praise and for the salvation of our neighbor? 

Every man look to himself! It is a wonderful, beautiful 
thing if someone has many gifts. But in the 12th chapter 
of Luke [v. 48] it is said: "Whoever has much, a heavy 
account will be demanded of him. If then thou hast not 
received a thousand florins, thou must not reckon them. 
But if thou hast had them, and hast not used them aright, 
beware! So, if you are a nobleman, mayor, magistrate, 
peasant, authority, another may not answer for it, but 
you must answer. If he has adorned and decorated you 
and hung the regiment on your neck, you must answer 
for it. If you are a doctor, a layman will not answer for it. 
You have not been given the power to abuse it for the 
condemnation of others. Much more, if he has given you 
a high intellect, a judgment against heretics, a good 
voice, a healthy body, you are a learned magister: that 
is good, but pray to God that you use such gifts of God 
rightly and always set the rule that you use the gifts for 
God's honor and glory.

and the neighbor's benefit. For | must give greater 
account than any poor schoolmaster. For | can do what 
they cannot. If | am proud and seek my honor, | am in 
the pit of hell. But he that hath not, let him not lack; and 
he that hath, let him lack, if he abuse it. For this is the 
way God wants it, that each one should serve the other, 
and everything should be done for the glory of God. If 
you fail in these two things, you will be condemned with 
your glorious gifts. Therefore, see that you direct all your 
gifts to love, service and kindness toward your neighbor, 
and that you have fervent love, so that God may be 
honored. If you do not do this, you are not a Christian. 

"With 1) the gift." "You are God's stewards." He now 
speaks of the church overseers 2) and stewards. 
Therefore see that your house is properly supplied and 
fed. He tells all kinds of examples of the various gifts of 
God. "If any man speak." St. Peter 3) divided the gifts 
into two parts, speaking and doing. For man can do no 
more than these two things. He suffers the other. Who 
then in this house is a householder, speaking or doing 
anything, or 4) both, there is bound up in me, that | may 
know that it is the word of God which is spoken unto 
thee, that thou mayest hear it, John 10:16. For neither 
shall we hear any thing but his word, neither shall | 
preach any thing but the word of God, lest the devil 
speak, or men speak only, or our reason, or philosophy. 
For nothing shall be preached nor heard here but the 
divine word alone, that | may say: | speak well; you hear 
the word of God. For God has also chosen for Himself a 
place on earth where He has His dwelling place, where 
His house is, wherein He alone speaks. 

But St. Peter speaks in a prophetic way that the 
Church is a bride, so a man is familiar. But Christ is the 
bridegroom, the Christian church is the bride.

The Virgin and Bride is the daughter of the Heavenly 
Father, who has given her to His Son Christ. The Holy 
Spirit is the chamberlain in a woman's room, who 
distributes the ornaments of glorious jewels and gifts. 
For this reason, the Christian church is glorious. For the 
prophets also make God the bridegroom, as Zechariah 
says [9:9]: "Rejoice, O daughter of Zion; be glad, O 
daughter of Jerusalem!" So also in the Gospel of the 
great supper [Luc. 14, 16. ff.]. Since Christ is a 
bridegroom, and the Father gives out the bride, and the 
Holy Spirit adorns her, she should hear nothing else but 
the bridegroom, the Word of God, and should hear no 
one else, not become a harlot. Therefore, the prophets 
have said that Israel is a virgin, for she is chaste and 
pure and clings only to the Word of God; as God also 
says to Elijah [1 Kings 19:18], "| have kept seven 
thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal, nor 
worshiped him. This is the bride. Next to them were 
many thousands who were harlots, and God also wanted 
to make a chamber, because he wanted to preach alone, 
and, as it happens on earth, if one has a bride, and there 
should be another around her, it would make bad blood 
and cost blood, it means a knife. Therefore it is called a 
bridal chamber, that the bridegroom and the bride alone 
should be in it, and father and mother and all the 
household should go away. 

Otherwise God has given the housekeeping and the 
worldly regiment. There you hear lawyers and doctors in 
the right. They belong to the courts of kings and princes. 
But in the brewery, you must not speak of such things, 
but only of the word of the Lord Christ. God has given 
house and farm. If you want to be wise and speak, you 
will have to do more than ten can do. If you want to do 
right in housekeeping, you will find enough. But in the 
secret chamber, there it shall be said: Out with lawyers, 
out with philosophers! and let them teach what they 
want, but listen to God's word alone. For the church 
should neither kiss nor embrace anyone else, but only 
the bridegroom, not the devil. For she is the daughter of 
God, the heavenly Father,

and the Holy Spirit has graced them with his gifts. These 
things are commanded me and thee, that thou 
shouldest hear, and | should teach. For this reason | 
must not listen to all others who preach something 
different, just as the pope also does, pushing his filth 
upon us so that we lose the gospel. But if it were 
followed here, the devil would have torn apart the bridal 
chamber and led the virgin into the wilderness, as 
Revelation says in the 12th chapter of John, so that no 
one saw her anymore. 

This should be the first thing, to hear the word of 
God. For the Bridegroom alone will speak, and the bride 
shall hear no one else but the Bridegroom. And with 
such a gift one should serve others, so that one's 
neighbor may be helped and God may be praised. For 
if | preach in such a way that you understand that it is 
the word of God, you cannot condemn me, and you 
cannot then be subject to me, that | should rule over you, 
nor can you then flatter me, that | should teach you, for 
it is the word of God. To him be praise and honor who 
has helped you with it. There is then no selfishness, 
avarice, pride. But if it is the other way around, then you 
add dirt to it and make an idol out of the gift. That's how 
it will harm you the most. 

But if a brew and mixture is made with the divine 
word and the statutes of men, you have immediately 
established a dominion, as the pope did, that whoever 
did not want to be obedient to him was condemned as 
a heretic, and with his preaching he brought about that 
the Antichrist became a lord over the church and 
blasphemed God and made us servants. So the bride of 
Christ is made a whore, just as it happens naturally; if a 
wife lets another to her, she is a whore. Thus the bridal 
chamber of Christ was made a whorehouse by the pope 
and the mobs, and many pious, chaste, chaste virgins 
were made whores. Therefore, see that the bridal 
chamber remains pure. If | do not seek God's glory and 
my neighbor's happiness with my gifts, | am 
condemned, just as you become an adulterer when you 
take another wife. 

So learn that nothing should resound in the church 
but God's word alone. Otherwise 





You are tired of talking about land and people, house 
and farm, each according to his status. But do not enter 
the Christian church with such filth! For there the word 
of God alone shall rule. There then remains God's praise 
and honor, and the neighbor's salvation and happiness. 
There you do not thank me, but the honor comes to the 
one who deserves it, namely God the Father through the 
Lord Christ. Then also give him thanks and praise 1) him 
that he has preached faithfully and you have listened. 

The other part: "If anyone has an office, that he do it 
as from the wealth that God gives. Here, each one 
should think about what he is doing, so that it does not 
come from his own devotion or endowment. For God 
does not want anything else to be heard in the bridal 
chamber except God's word and His works, and what 
He does with her and creates. Otherwise she is a whore. 
Whoever wants to preach, counsel, comfort and instruct, 
let him distinguish himself so that he remains only with 
God's word. 

So whoever does anything, let him do it from the 
power and ability that God provides. For this reason we 
boast so great and glorious that we have only God's 
word in our churches. But we are so ungrateful. We 
suffer nothing to be taught but the bad word of God. We 
don't want the charade of the pope and the cults. But we 
should do so: baptize, sit in confession, administer the 
sacrament. Where does the ability come from that a 
child, washed in baptism, should be clean from all its 
sins, and that | should put on its vest shirt as a sign? 
Now it is the work of the Holy Spirit when | baptize in the 
name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Where does 
the great power come from that a sinful man should 
subject himself to such a power that he wants to baptize 
a child and save it from sins, death and the devil? This 
does not grow in his heart, but it corrupts from the fact 
that Christ says [Marc. 16, 15.]: "Go into all the world 
and preach the gospel to every creature," so that 
through Jesus Christ we may be saved and God may be 
glorified through Jesus Christ, as St. Peter says; and yet 
this is what we must do.

do. They say, "We baptize," but it is out of the wealth 
that God provides. If you are not sure that the ability is 
from God, then stop! It should be said: | do not baptize, 
and yet | baptize. It should be known that it is God's work 
and ability that | lay hands on you and absolve you, 
saying: "| absolve you of all your sins, be of good cheer! 
Why should you forgive sin and set your heart at peace 
with God? If | do it now out of my own wealth, | have 
blasphemed and profaned God, as the pope and the 
bishops do, who say: | alone am the high priest; if you 
put on a cap, you are blessed. No! Say thou, Where is 
the word of God? But the Holy Spirit, saith he, hath 
inspired me. Lie in the name of the devil! Thou hast not 
the power of God, but a noisome trumpery and monkey 
play. But they lead the saying [Matth. 16, 19.], "What 
thou shalt loose on earth, that shall be loosed also in 
heaven." We have this power, if we believe. It has power 
and emphasis. It is not ours, but His who says, "I give 
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven" [Matt. 16:19]. If 
he wants to let it be solved and absolved, then it applies. 
What shall my absolving be, if he does not do it? God 
says to Moses: You shall not bless, | will bless. 
Therefore, one should not do anything in the church, 
unless one is sure that God will provide the means first. 
So, the pope says: The holy water has this power, this 
herb has that power. From where does the water and 
herb you consecrate have such power and authority to 
take away sin and drive out the devil? From where? 
Well, baptism, absolution, the Lord's Supper, the laying 
on of hands! Yes, but, my brother, this cannot be 
compared to that. The Lamb of God has no resemblance 
to consecration, 1) except from the devil. 

Therefore, the bridal chamber should be kept pure, 
and nothing should be done, except to say that God 
speaks, baptizes, and administers the sacrament.

are God's tongue, hand and instruments. So, if we 
ordain priests and command them to preach God's word 
and comfort the sick, how do | know that this is an 
ability? That St. Paul 1 Tim. 3, 1. says: "If anyone desires 
a bishop's office, he desires a goodly work." If he had 
not commanded that the church should raise up 
preachers, who would? In the church nothing is to be 
taught but the word of God, and there one does what he 
has ordered, and then each one thinks: | am in the state 
that God has established, whether | am a lord or a 
servant, a prince or a subject. Outside the church, where 
there is a house and court regiment, and even more so 
in the bridal chamber, one must know what God's word 
and work is. 

"That in all things God may be glorified through Jesus 
Christ. This is how it should be. Let all things bring glory 
to God the Father, that he may be glorified. For the 
Word, the sacraments, absolution, matrimony, the 
power of the keys, are all God's work. But in the world 
we turn it around. Each one uses the gifts of God for his 
own glory and benefit, not for God's glory and his 
neighbor's blessedness. But in eternal life it will not be 
like that. 

Now he decides that Christ is natural God, who shall 
have "honor" "from eternity to eternity". But he was born 
at the time of Augustus, so how can he be God from 
eternity? He is at the same time the only Son of God and 
also of the Virgin. From the Father he is born in eternity, 
but from Mary temporally, and are not two sons and 
Christ. For the Son of God is also the Son of Mary. He is 
not separated. Therefore it is said to the Hebrews [13, 
8.], "JEsus Christ yesterday and today, and the same 
also forever!" And Peter above in the 1st chapter [v. 20]: 
"Who indeed was given before the foundation of the 
world was laid", and 1 Cor. 10, 9. Paul says that the 
children of Israel tempted Christ in the wilderness, and 
that he was also with them and led them out of Egypt. 
But he was not yet born a man at that time. But as long 
as the Godhead is, so long shall he also be the Son of 
Mary.

Second sermon on 1 Peter 5:5, 6. 


Held on the 3rd Sunday after Trinity, June 22, 1539. 


Like them, young people, be subject to the elders. 
All of you be subject to one another, and hold fast to 
humility. For God resists the proud, but gives grace 
to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under 
the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in his 
time. 

This epistle does not teach about the main thing that 
1) we call Christian faith, but only exhorts to good works. 
For we see and grasp here that we are not such 
preachers who forbid good works, but we teach and 
preach about good works. But there are four good 
pieces in it. 

The first one is about humility. He spoke of the 
preachers, as can be seen from the beginning of the 5th 
chapter, and told them, who govern the people with the 
word and sacraments, that they are not set as lords, that 
their rule is not worldly. The world must have this, and 
God has given it sword, gallows and other powers. No 
preacher should exalt himself, but be humble and help 
the people with preaching and good examples. For our 
rule is not dominion. All others should do the same, even 
if they are not preachers or in spiritual government, but 
are who or what they are. The young people should 
humble themselves, the youth should honor their age. 
One should be respectful to a gray head. For this is 
honestly and well suited to youth. If only we could 
persuade the youth! The young males and females 
should be obedient to the old matrons, and the maids to 
the wives. Students and servants should be obedient 
and humble. Learn this and see if it would not stand well 
in the world if it were so. So the young team should 
honor the old age. The boys should also be humble and 
let themselves be drawn and obey their parents, and 
also be willing to obey their masters. If they now followed 


St. Peter's teaching, then they would have 
1) Buchwald: that. 





We have enough good works to do. | would rather see 
such a city, where the youth would be obedient to the 
elders, otherwise see a hundred barefoot monasteries. 
If the youth were admonished and followed, even if the 
old men and women honored the young, then it would be 
well. 

It is now a very mean complaint how disobedient, 
wanton, hopeful and proud the youth is. For when a 
schoolmaster punishes a pupil, or a matron scolds a 
maiden, she says: What is it to thee? Well, it is God's 
commandment that one should be humble. It is not 
arbitrary that it should be up to thee whether thou shalt 
do it or not, but thou shalt do it with goodness and will, 
or thou shalt have thunder over thy head. The youth is 
now wild, rough and naughty, and no one wants to be 
punished, but everyone wants to be a squire, free 2). But 
everyone will be to this vice and one speaks of the 
courtly: Fie on you, you impudent, you proud wretch! 
One is despised and cursed, and also maligned by those 
whom it does not concern, and arrogance or pride harms 
no one but yourself. And this is yet to be despised, that 
men spit upon one another; but God above in heaven will 
not suffer it, saying, Ye shall not be hopeful. If you will 
not be humble for the sake of the Lord Christ's example, 
which is set before us and preached to us, and if you will 
not let the world curse you for the sake of men, for the 
sake of your contempt, then do it for the sake of the 
wretched devil, who is cast out of heaven for the sake of 
hope. If then thou art hopeful, thou hast first of all for an 
enemy the whole human race, which saith, Behold, thou 
young wretch, fie on thee! Above that, that the whole 
world also sneers at you, you also have God as your 
enemy. You have started a vicious quarrel against God, 
who has rejected you.

ungestraft sein".

create. If therefore thou wouldest not spare thyself, that 
the world should grudge thee, consider that our Lord 
taketh thunder and lightning in his hand, and wilt smite 
thee therewith. 

But the world follows the example of the devil. For if 
you look at the Bible, you will find that the devil wanted 
to sit hard with our Lord God, and Lucifer says [Is. 14:13]: 
"| will ascend into heaven, and exalt my throne above 
the stars of God." But he fell into the abyss of hell. We 
follow this example, especially the young people, who do 
not think otherwise than that they are everything. 

Look at the examples in my time! Muenzer was proud 
of his heart, and so were the Anabaptists. But how did 
they fare? They have not only done great harm to the 
court, but also disgraced it. But not only the world is 
unfavorable to them, but also all creatures, God and the 
angels. Therefore he admonishes us not only with 
frightening examples, but also with kind words, and 
says: "The bishops should first remain in their office and 
let emperors and kings rule. Then he addresses the 
youth; when they are punished and admonished by old 
honest people, they should not say, "What are you 
asking about that, you old man, but call them fathers? 
But if you do, you must hear: She has hardly crawled out 
of her shell and does not look at an honest matron! 
Therefore let the devil take you in marriage. Then God 
says: You are not a Christian, your baptism and Christ 
are lost in you. You are of the devil, as you stand and 
walk. | have seen many such virgins who remained 
sitting and were despised. But Christ humbled himself 
for our sake even to the death of the cross, Phil. 2:8. 
Therefore we should also humble ourselves, or we are 
not Christians. And if we are proud against those who 
are higher than we are, then the baptism, suffering and 
blood of Christ are lost to us. 

The spirits of the wicked are hopeful in the first table, 
and they have a devilish arrogance (which is straight 
against the name and word of God), which grows out of 
the spiritual 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter.

goods. These are usually the bishops, preachers and 
their disciples, who have learned something from them, 
because they turn into rats. Therefore they puff 
themselves up, saying: "| am learned, | have the spirit of 
God," and think that they are so wise that the whole 
world is vain fools against them. 

This hope arises and grows from the gifts of the spirit, 
as being learned in the Scriptures, about which they 
especially boast a lot. After that, that one is a learned 
lawyer or doctor of medicine. These are all gifts of God, 
that one is a skilled theologian, jurist or medicus. From 
this arises a haughtiness, that they think the others are 
all geese and fools, or stink before them as dirt, not 
thinking that their skill is God's gift or grace. Item, if one 
can make a little verse, he does not consider it a gift of 
God, but as if it had grown on him by nature, then they 
pride themselves on the gifts of God and abuse them, 
blaspheme and disgrace God, whom they should 
otherwise honor and praise. A theologian remembers: | 
am an excellent, learned man. But you say here: | should 
serve others with my art, and should not want to be a 
delicious magister or a lord. But the devil does not let us 
recognize the gifts of God, but only tempts us to pride 
ourselves with them. Lawyers who are not theologians 
are the worst. So are theologians who do not have the 
Spirit of God; no one can agree with them. To all of them 
St. Peter says: You should not be proud! 

And here lift up and learn what right good works are! 
What is a cap or a plate against it? Learn then to say, 
Though | have more gifts than another, yet am | no 
better. Why am | proud? What am | bragging about? Do 
| want to push our Lord God down from heaven? 
Therefore | will be humble. For the humble are our Lord 
God's friends, and God is also their friend. And if they do 
not humble themselves, everything about them, baptism 
and Christ, is lost. Therefore he says, "Hold fast to 
humility!" For the devil will also want to take away this 
virtue. 

Let every trustworthy person know that 


1312 


that he has made God his adversary, and that he has 
lost Christ and baptism! This is pride against the first 
table, if we do not use the gifts of God for His glory and 
the benefit of our neighbor. So with this pride | make 
everyone despise me, yes, God himself is mine, and | 
will not partake of the gifts and goods of Christ; as we 
see then that the rotten spirits all go to the devil with the 
wicked. 

After that, arrogance is in the other table. Since 1) 
one is a prince or nobleman, he thinks the others are all 
geese. And if they are learned, they make themselves 
believe that they are doing well by despising others. But 
here you have a verdict that God and the world are 
looking at you. What an excellent work it is when a prince 
is born of a high tribe, and yet lives humbly, not exalting 
himself with jewelry and gifts! Should such not stand 
better than a cap or plate? Is it not a beautiful virtue 
when a count is humble! No more adornment adorns 
him. For God is well pleased with humility. Therefore 
hear what God says, who says: Humble yourself, or you 
are not a Christian, but the property of the devil. Your 
cap or crown will not save you from death and sins. 
Therefore, remember to judge yourself first by the 
example of the Lord Christ and not by the image of the 
devil. 

This is the arrogance of the burghers and peasants. 
That is why they have so many guilders and thalers. 
They make themselves believe that they should be 
worshipped. But it is ridiculous for them to be so proud. 
It reminds me of the way they used to decorate pictures. 
If a citizen is a little learned, he is a fine little creature. 
Then the goose feathers have also grown. About this is 
also the women's court. Some are so beautiful that they 
stink with pride. She lets herself think that her dirt stinks, 
too. 

St. Peter wants to indicate that the world does not like 
hope. For the world is not like whores and thieves, as it 
is like this vice, piety. But here you hear the judgment of 
God, of all the angels and nations, that 


1) Buchwald: that. 


Five sermons on 1 Petr. Cap. 4 and 5. 


1313 


The proud are unpleasant and cursed people. And if you 
are also proud, you have lost God's grace and mercy, 
and Christ is of no use to you, and you have also lost His 
everlasting kingdom. Therefore he says, "Hold fast to 
humility." Let me tell you a lesson! If you are proud, 
whether in the first or in the second table, as God has 
adorned and gifted you, whether in soul or in body, that 
you are noble, beautiful, or rich in goods, each one learn 
the lesson: "God resists the hopeful." There you have an 
enemy, who is called God, with his dear angels and 
saints, and the 2) world, which is otherwise bad and evil. 
Such a rejected filth is arrogance, that even the evil 
world cannot let you go unchallenged. Write the rhyme 
in your house, much more in your heart: "God resists the 
hopeful", and do not forget it! God is then not only 
unfavorable to you, but you have a quarrel against God, 
and have lost God, Christ and baptism, and are in the 
devil's jaws and crawling up his ass. Therefore, if a 
Christian wants to be such a Christian, it is not 
necessary for him to go to a monastery and call upon the 
saints. Here St. Peter shows him what pleases God and 
what adorns and decorates you before God more than 
any emperor's crown and splendor; namely, that 
everyone be humble in his position. If an old, honest man 
punishes or admonishes you, accept it kindly. If you are 
a theologian and have many gifts, humble yourself even 
against a child still in the cradle or recently born, or you 
will have God as your enemy. 

This is truly a fine sermon of good works. And this is 
a fine house, village, city and school, where children 
behave against their parents, and students against their 
teachers, young journeymen against old people, young 
women against honest matrons. But the devil prevents 
it. We cannot get this angelic clothing. Because the devil 
is proud. Therefore he cannot suffer you to be humble. 
When a maid is scolded, she says: | would make my wife 
hellish. 


2) Buchwald: the. 


1314 


Have fire! So also a servant says: Before | would suffer 
this, | would have the Lord St. Vitus. 1) Now be proud, 
but know that the devil is your god, and just as he has 
fallen and been thrust out of heaven into hell, so he will 
also drag you with him. It is no trouble for a man to wear 
a gray cap and flask, for now everyone wears a flask. 
So it is not much work to get up at night and sing. But 
that you, maiden, should hold an honest matron in 
honor, or that a student should let himself be pulled by 
his schoolmaster, and that one of the nobility should be 
humble, that will not follow. The devil is blocking and 
defending himself. Therefore St. Peter says: "Hold fast 
to humility", as if he should say: If you want to be 
humble, you must be braided, stapled and knotted 
together. As if someone already wants to anger me and 
gives me cause for impatience, gives me an evil word or 
an opportunity for malice or anger, and the devil also 
provokes me to it, then one says: "Shall | suffer this? 
Soon one falls into the other's hair. Therefore you must 
join your hands together. For humility will not come in, 
nor will it be put on like a gray skirt. For there is the devil, 
who does nothing but sow hope among men, so that 
they say, "| have as much money in my pocket as you 
have. Item: | am as noble, beautiful and learned as you. 
Let it be true at once, but think: Why was beauty, skill, 
wisdom and understanding given to me by God, but that 
| should serve God humbly with them and be beneficial 
to my neighbor? Even if | am provoked to anger, | shall 
not do it, but hold fast, clench my claws; for it is easily 
taken. It tickles you that you are noble. That is one 
reason why it wants to drive away your hope and take 
away your humility. 

If we acted in such a way as to be humble, we would 
be full of good works. For it is impossible that a humble 
man should do or do any evil work. If aman is noble and 
humble, he is full of good works, and he wins the love 
and favor of his fellow men.

Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1315 


Subjects and grace with God, that he may grow and 
increase in the knowledge and faith of the Lord Christ. 
Humility does not make one proud, nor does it make one 
do evil, and in the meantime we made the monks wear 
caps. Our humility is useful and useful to men and 
pleasing to God. But if you are not humble, then hatred, 
envy, anger, malice, all kinds of harm, oppression, 
hindrance, defense and all kinds of devilish works flow 
out of your attitude of hope. 

But these are right works that adorn us and are 
acceptable before God, before all angels and before the 
world, even before all evil people, namely humility, that 
the humble have a fine peaceful heart. For otherwise one 
has a troubled heart and disfavor with God and men. 
Whoever wants to have God as his enemy, let him follow 
the devil and be only proud! He will soon lose Christ, who 
redeemed him with his blood, and his baptism will be in 
vain. 

Therefore he says not only, "Be humble," but also, 
"Hold fast to humility. For evil men and the devil will 
tempt you to hope. But therefore beware of this vice. "For 
God resists the proud." If you are proud, you can do no 
good. For what you do comes from pride. 

There St. Peter lets a little bit of the dread underrun, 
as if he should say: You have a "mighty hand" over you, 
so that the hope can steer. For hope is a water bubble, 
and not yet so strong, which makes a great belly, as if it 
wanted to storm the sky. But there is no power nor force 
behind it, and it is capable of as much strength as a fly's 
foot. Even if one were graced and adorned with many 
gifts, one is still like a water bubble. As Isaiah said in the 
40th chapter [P. 6. 7.]: "All flesh is like hay, and all its 
goodness is like a flower of the field. The hay withers, 
the flower fades; for the Spirit of the Lord blows in it." 
Item, in the same chapter the prophet says: "Behold, the 
Gentiles are esteemed as a drop that abideth in the 
bucket, and as a mite that abideth in the balance. 
Behold, the isles are as a little stick."

If it is so about you that you do not know from your 
power and authority whether you will still live tomorrow 
or have your thalers and use them, and you are not sure 
of your life for a moment, but above you, up in heaven, 
is the "mighty hand" that is stretched out with thunder 
and lightning, what are we proud of? He did not spare 
the angels, who were pure and glorious creatures and 
had beautiful angelic gifts. He will not spare yours either. 
It is a glorious gift that one is a prince, just as Ezekiel 
says of the prince of Tyre [27:3, 28:2, 14] that he is the 
most beautiful on earth, as the most beautiful angels are 
in heaven. Yet he says, "How will you fare? You must go 
to the abyss of hell. The fact that you are a nobleman is 
given to you by God. Otherwise you are born as naked 
in the world as another, and you are not sure of your life 
for a moment. 

Read all the histories and you will find it alfo, and 
experience will also teach you. 2) The pope is also proud 
and has had his feet kissed. Pope Alexander III stepped 
on the neck of the Emperor Barbarossa and told the 
verse from the 91st Psalm [v. 13.]: "On the lions and 
vipers you will walk and tread on the young lions and 
dragons." 3) Wasn't that a splendid arrogance? But the 
emperor suffered it patiently and said: | do it not to thee, 
but in honor of St. Petro. But 


1) Buchwald: morning. 
2) Buchwald: learn. 
3) Cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, vol. XIX, 1964. 





the pope stepped on his neck once again. This 
arrogance has been too great. 

Now our Lord God can. He is a visitator; he sleeps, 
lets you be arrogant and grow. If it will be too much, God 
opens his eyes. Then the pope will no longer kick the 
emperor. 

The Turk is also proud; but | hope he is on the highest 
level. He may scuffle us one more; for the text is not 
missing: "God resists the proud. If the Turk were a 
hundred thousand times as proud, it would not help him 
if he opened his eyes, whose power is above. He will 
then ask as little about the Turkish emperor's and the 
pope's power as | ask about a fly. Therefore see that you 
do not despise this, and humble yourself! Then you will 
have a gracious God, and men will also be kind and 
favorable to you. For even wicked and evil men praise 
this virtue. Therefore, we should not boast or be proud, 
but fear the wrath of God. He will make you "high" before 
Him and before men "in His time". Again, the hour will 
not fail to come when you will be cast down for the sake 
of hope. 

This would be reason enough to humble oneself. But 
the devil does not admit it. He wants such poor water 
bubbles to be proud. If you want to have an angry God, 
and if all the sacraments that God has otherwise given 
you are in vain, then lift yourself up and be hopeful. 
Again, if God is to be your friend, and if it is good for you, 
be humble!

Today is the day of St. Peter and St. Paul, therefore they 
should be remembered as the highest apostles. But their 
legends are very much falsified by the pope, without it 
being known for certain in the Gospel that they were 
called by Christ to the apostleship. All other books say 
that St. Peter was crucified in Rome. But the pope leans 
very much from St. Peter. Today, the highest feast is 
held in Rome, not for the sake of St. Peter, but because 
the Pope is the head of the whole world for the sake of 
St. Peter. Today, in Rome, St. Peter's and St. Paul's 
heads are also pointed out, and all the prestige is left for 
real skulls, since they are wooden and painted with 
colors. The pope and his people know well that they are 
wooden skulls; only that he thus fools and mimics us. No 
man has virtue in himself, as the pope and his have, that 
they mock God and man. The Turk and the Tartars are 
also wicked men; but that they should point wood to St. 
Peter's and Paul's heads, they do not. But the Pabst's 
way is to ape us poor Christians and lead us around by 
the nose. Therefore, we should thank God that we have 
come out of this error and must no longer hold the work 
of fools high and for sanctity, as it is still highly 
celebrated in Rome. | have seen several paintings there, 
which the evangelist St. Lucas is said to have painted. 

But now we do not have St. Paul's and Peter's heads, 
nor anything else from their bones, but both their spirit 
and soul, and what they had in their heart, we still know. 
It is not really known in Rome where the heads of both 
apostles have gone. For God did it to them as He did to 
Moses, who had to die with Miriam in the desert, and the 
Jews did not know their burial place, so that they would 
not worship Moses' corpse. 

It is said that in the kingdom of France there are six 
apostles and in Spain four, St. Matthias is said to be in 
Trier. 1) But we have St. John, St. Peter, St. Paul alive 
with us, as well as the Lord.

Christ; spirit and soul live in us, speak with us. For what 
would | gain from this if | had their bones with me in a 
golden coffin? They could not talk to me, and | would 
gain nothing at all with them if we were not also to hear 
their language and speech. Therefore let them be fooled 
by the sanctuary they have invented; we still have their 
doctrine, sermon and epistles. Let us make a proper 
shrine, that we may lay up their doctrine, wisdom, and 
thoughts in it. For even if we had their bones and had a 
golden church built for them, it would not help us. But 
here we can still hear them speak, just as if they were 
still alive. For if they were alive, they could not speak 
otherwise than as they wrote in their epistles. For this 
reason we now have them spiritually alive with us. Let 
this be a sanctuary for us, which they do not have in 
Rome. So we celebrate the feasts of the apostles every 
day, as often as we preach their gospels and epistles, 
and those who hear them now hear them as well as 
those who lived in their time and heard them. Therefore 
we are blessed people who still have the apostles’ 
writings, and | would rather have David's soul and spirit 
than his body. For the body could not speak to me, but 
when | open the psalter, David speaks to me as if he 
were present with me. So we are set much higher than 
the pope, if we alone accepted their preaching and 
honored them spiritually. For one does them no honor, if 
one closes their dead legs in a golden coffin and keeps 
them. But take his epistle to the Romans and other 
epistles, and learn from them to know Christ, whom | 
have taught, that ye may know to say of me, how | have 
taught Christ. So even St. Peter, St. Paul and all the 
saints say to us that we should honor them in this way. 
So | would rather that anyone accept my teaching than 
put my dead body in a box of gold. 

So we honor the saints St. Peter and St. Paul, that we 
may know what their heart was, if we accept and listen 
to their teaching, which they spoke through the Holy 
Spirit, 


2) Buchwald: on it.

who dwelt in their souls. Now accept St. Peter, you have 
his spirit, soul and heart here, since he says: "Humble 
yourselves! It is an honor for me that you have kept this 
and have recognized your God and Lord through me. 

Now we hear further about St. Peter's sanctuary. 
"Cast all your care upon him." This is a beautiful sermon, 
as he preaches from his heart, saying: "Learn to cast all 
your care upon God, and be sure that he will take care 
of you." He speaks of the Christians, who have to suffer 
much in the world, and says: "Whatever you have, bodily 
and spiritual, cast it confidently home to him with all joy; 
do not think: Where will | take money or a house, this or 
that, where will | stay if | am to die? The world thus does 
that it can do nothing else but care, does not cast its care 
on God, but cares how it may become rich, how it may 
be healthy. It also has on itself the spiritual concern, how 
it may receive a gracious God and die blessedly. 

But hear thou St. Peter, what thou shalt do! The 55th 
Psalm [v. 23.], "Cast thy cause upon the Lord. He will 
provide for thee, and will not leave the righteous in 
trouble for ever." So also here St. Peter says: "Give it 
from yourself and let it be from God and say: Oh, 
heavenly Father, you have created me; now it does not 
work as | would like it to work differently. And go thou 
then, establish thy office and work of thy profession, 
saith GOD, and let me take care! This doctrine we 
Christians hold (which is found nowhere else [but in the 
Holy Scriptures]) 1) alone; [it is] in St. Peter's heart, and 
written by his heart and pen. No pagan, no jurist can 
throw away the care, but are all very careful, and if it 
does not turn out as they would like, they want to 
become mad and foolish. Here, look at the lives of all 
people, especially the great merchants; they spend their 
lives with useless worries and plots, and when things go 
badly, they want to fly off the handle. It was much better 
that 


1) We made this addition from the interpretation of the first epistle 
of St. Peter, Col. 1284, from the Berten: "Dieweil es GOtt so will 
haben." This sentence reads in Buchwald: "We Christians hold this 
doctrine, which is found nowhere else, in St. Peter's Pagans alone"

| would follow St. Peter's advice, and | would arrange my 
office and let God take care of it; that a prince would 
protect the pious and punish the wicked, and could order 
God to take care of them. No, one does not do that. Yes, 
| should punish him or speak harshly to him, so that he 
might do me harm! Oh, if you want to be careful, then just 
leave the office! Now you like to hear us praising and 
extolling all the estates, but nevertheless no one wants 
to do his duty. When the authorities are called upon to 
perform their office, they hesitate and fear that this or that 
may happen to them. Now the authorities have not been 
praised by us because they alone come in beautiful 
clothes. Nor is the clergy praised because a bishop is a 
splendid, handsome person, but because he is 
supposed to go out and grab the hair and wool of those 
who live angrily and punish them. This is what God 
wants; then the honor will be found. But the authorities 
want to be praised for being highborn, and they want to 
use the Gospel alone for this purpose, where it is good 
for them. But it is said: Do your duty and give the care to 
the Lord. 

Some also say of me: "I should not write against the 
bishops as | did against the bishop of Mainz, because it 
might cause unpleasantness. | will let God take care of 
that. If you do not want to do the same, what do you seek 
in the office? Let someone else sit in it, who can order 
God to take care of it! There is a lack of all ranks, and 
especially of regimentation, so that no one wants to hang 
on the cat's bells. The lower classes should govern 
themselves. But it does not happen; God knows it well. 
That is why he established the authorities and gave them 
parents, because children are evil by nature. 

It is lacking that one does not want to take it and 
command God to take care of it. God has taken upon 
Himself the greatest thing, namely the worry. God had 
the light before He made the sun, and He could do 
without the sun. So he could also rule without you and 
punish all murder and vice; but he does not want to do it, 
he wants to use you for this, since you, regent, are to 
punish the wicked, as St. Paul says Romans 13:4. He 
could also preach to all without the apostles, comforting 
the afflicted, 


1322

1323 





and punish, but he will do it by means. But the 
negligence of the authorities is now great; they are lazy 
dogs that feist on the cushion, and make a stink, as 
Isaiah says, eating the good morsels out of the bowl. But 
if we are Christians, we must confess that a Christian will 
speak and live in a way that offends people, and will 
punish sin. 

But only do so, says St. Peter, do not be so careful; 
but do what you have to do in your position and office, 
go through with boots and spurs! If we were not such 
lazy, gluttonous dogs, God would accomplish much 
through us. 

With the Turks and the Jews there is vain work and 

stopping, and our Lord God lets the enemy succeed. The 
priest does the same. But we don't want to do anything, 
we all want to sit on our cushions. If you are afraid of 
people's useless speeches, blasphemies, and scurrilous 
words, you are a felt. Rather, say: | have power and 
authority from God to punish, to ward off evil, so that 
everyone may be afraid, otherwise you yourself are the 
cause of an evil regime and of all evil; just as | was put 
in the preaching ministry for this reason, that | should 
punish; whether it upsets the people and they are angry 
about it, what is it to me? | did not start it for this reason, 
so that | would be praised. Let it be as God wills! So let 
us continue in doing and suffering, and cast our care 
upon him. In the same way, when | am sick or in mortal 
distress, | should say. If you are a Christian, you are 
talking here about St. Peter's sanctuary, that God has let 
you live so long, and has not preserved you because of 
your sorrow, as your own experience testifies, and has 
given you his dear Son. Into the hands of God | will 
entrust myself; go, dear soul! 
Thus, the Holy Spirit through St. Peter wants to make the 
hearts of all Christians peaceful and comforting, so that 
they will do everything they are commanded to do in their 
profession, and also suffer everything, and still have a 
joyful heart that God can command everything and say: 
| do what God has commanded me to do. If | have to 
suffer persecution, | suffer as much as | can. If | have to 
die because of it, then | command God to do my best. 





Soul, so that the care remains with God alone, who has 
taken it upon himself. Oh, if one could persuade the wise 
people and the princes and the great merchants, who 
think that they often want to help things with their 
suggestions, wise counsels and practices, that they 
would do their duty and let God take care (for He has 
taken the greatest upon Himself), then things would be 
much different for them. 

But we even turn it around, bite and eat ourselves 
with the worries, how this or that may happen. Then we 
fail to see that it does not happen. The preacher of 
Solomon also says: "Do what is your duty and do not 
worry. For a long time you must worry that it will rain or 
that the sun will shine. Nothing will come of your care, 
but plow the earth and pray that God's will be done and 
the grain will grow well. The great worry of farmers and 
noblemen is the devil. We Christians are called to work 
and suffer. He who wants to do his work properly will 
have to suffer, but let him command God to take care of 
it. That is why | say that everyone should do what he is 
obliged to do in his profession, work and suffer, and the 
third, as the care, give home to our Lord God. But the 
world does not follow St. Peter's advice, but does the 
opposite. It does nothing and hinders the trades, nor 
does it want to suffer anything, but the people fall into 
vain sorrow. Wouldn't it be better to work and go about it 
freshly and confidently, even if one had to suffer 
something unpleasant about it, that one would only be 
cheerful about it and say: Therefore, | have not slept; 1) 
| have prayed and commanded God the matter, God will 
send it well. 

We Christians have this teaching. The pope, the 
lawyers and the Turks do not have it. The Jews have 
nothing but blasphemy against Christ. But we know that 
God is almighty and can give everything, and we should 
call upon Him boldly and boldly as our dear Father and 
cast our cares upon Him. He is pleased to do so. This is 
what we can do, so that we can get rid of our worries 
altogether. He also has a strong neck and back and can 
carry it well. 


1) Buchwald: "and would therefore speak without being left out: |" 
2c. - For our improvement, compare Walch, old edition, vol. 9, 1276, 
§ 33.

Therefore throw them on him, "because", says St. Peter, 
"he cares for you". If he said that about gold and silver, 
that it had the power and strength to take care of our life, 
health and food! If a prince could do that, provide for 
every man! But since it is now preached by God, who is 
true and almighty, that we should confidently cast all 
care upon him, if we could do that, this life would be half 
a paradise. But because of our care we lead a 
troublesome and miserable life. Verily, in times past we 
ran to Rome, to St. Jacob and now and then, and would 
have liked to be free of worry. | became a monk for the 
sake of sorrow and gladly sought a happy good 
conscience toward God at the end of the world. But now 
it comes to us, and without money, that God, who 
created you, sustains you and preserves your life. He 
also takes care of you. Earlier you were tired of torture. 
When you work and suffer what seems evil to you, when 
things do not go your way, know that God cares for you! 

If we did that, we would have half of heaven and 
paradise. Think what a treasure it is to have a quiet, 
peaceful heart. Even if you are sick and full of French, 
your courage is good and joyful in the Lord. Now where 
the pestilence comes from, | ask nothing of it, for God is 
careful for me. And to such people all evil and 
wickedness would be a sweet yoke. Otherwise, one 
cannot do any good work, nor suffer anything, and 
becomes an unfit person, so that sin and shame are the 
result. 

Now if you want to see St. Peter, not the head, but 
his heart, hear what he says here: "Cast all your anxiety 
out of him! Do not keep them 1) with you, and do not so 
as to remember: Who knoweth whether he remember 
me? For then you make yourself such a man, unfit to 
work and to suffer. Yes, say the wise men, do not throw 
it into the corner, it cannot be thrown away like that! 
Therefore, St. Peter says, "Do not doubt what God has 
commanded here, that you may cast your trust in Him, 
and you can 


1) Buchwald: "Keep it". 


Five sermons on 1 Petr. Cap. 4 and 5. 


1325 


don't throw so much at him, he'd rather [if you throw all 
your worries at him]. 2) If we learned this art, we would 
do more in one year than others do in a hundred years. 
A fearful prince does not execute his office. But he says: 
Dear God, | command you, | will dare it in your name. If 
it goes badly for me, you will help, - he can do much 
good; for the great stone "unbelief", that is, his worries 
and thoughts are gone. For he hangs it on our Lord 
God's neck, there it lies well. 

It is a fine golden saying, which every Christian 
should know well, that St. Peter says: Be sure that God 
cares for you. Otherwise the devil sows worry in our 
hearts; but worry does not belong in it, but on our Lord 
God's back, who says: | will see to it that your work goes 
forth. When the opposite is done, their hearts are full of 
sadness and sorrow, and because of this they become 
sullen, afraid of all bushes, and impatient. It serves them 
right; why do they turn the hindmost into the foremost? 
Those who are in office do not want it. If we had people 
who governed in this way, things would be fine. But none 
of the mayors, nobles and priests will do anything. Truly, 
if you neglect and neglect the government with your 
care, you will have to give God a heavy account for it. 
But here you have a crown and a rosary, so that people 
will honor you. They also give honor, authority to the 
authorities. But you, authorities, do not do your duty, you 
only want to eat the fat and not step into the dung. So 
now the youth also wants to be pulled. If they could 
govern themselves, there would be no need for so many 
estates and order, authorities. But God wants to prove 
His majesty and strength in our weakness. He accepts 
me as a preacher who is like a fly and a water bubble. 
Before, he created us from nothing. So we human 
beings are still the same as nothing. For today we are 
alive, tomorrow we are dead, and yet He does not meet 
the devil with 


2) Supplemented by Buchwald.

Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1327 





The Lord will not be able to do the glorious majesty that 
he will do on the last day, but he will do it in weakness 
and foolishness. There he can also do great things. 

Now St. Peter preaches about the devil. Here you 
see that the devil is the cause of all sorrow and 
misfortune. 


Be sober and watchful, for your adversary the 
devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom 
he may devour. 


He wants to say that we are not set on the cushion, 
and that we should eat the fat above, but we have an 
adversary, the devil. That would be still low; but that is 
hard, that he is hostile to us and is grievous, and in 
addition he is wicked and strong. He does not want to 
fight with stones and trees, even though he sometimes 
rumbles in the woods and throws everything over, but he 
means you Christians. 

This enemy is not so that he snores and sleeps and 
sits on a cushion, but he goes about day and night, and 
there is no feasting with him, and does not go about that 


he sees what we do, but how he devours us. Therefore 
we should not be safe, as if the devil were far from us 
and beyond the sea, but with us in the city, in the 
chamber, yes, in our flesh and blood. And we also see 
how much misfortune, murder, death, fornication and 
avarice he causes, except the great gross murders. He 
causes many miserable cases. Listen to St. Peter, who 
says: "We have an adversary, who not only hinders the 
spiritual and temporal government, but also brings and 
leads us into other gross evil and sin. There we only hear 
him, here 1) we grasp him. That is why people do not 
hear God's word and become such people. We have 
enough to do who hear God's word daily and learn to 
resist this enemy. How will others resist him, who live 
without all knowledge of God, without faith and fear of 
God? 


1) "grasp" put by us, instead of: "praise" in Buchwald. Already 
earlier (St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. 7, 1514) we saw that Buchwald read g 
in p: "to throw out with rags" instead of: "nnt lungs". 





Fourth sermon on I Peter 5:8. 


Held on the 5th Sunday after Trinity, July 6, 1539. 


You have heard how St. Peter exhorts that everyone 
should be humble in his position. For God has distributed 
many gifts to men, and has also ordained many ranks. 
But for the sake of these gifts, since God has adorned 
one before another, let no one exalt himself and be 
proud, item, that we should learn to cast all our care upon 
God, for he cares for us. For this he says, "Watch," for 
this | will forewarn you: "The devil prowls about like a 
roaring lion." This warning he gives us. Now we know 
that the devil has two kinds in him: namely, he is a 
murderer and a liar, and he has been so from the 
beginning of the world; from the beginning he has not 
stood in the truth, but has fallen out. 


So he is a death-slayer from the creation of the world. 
As soon as Adam was created, he struck dead. With lies 
he also strikes the soul dead, just as he brings the body 
into the earth, so that a man must die in heaven and on 
earth. This is the devil's work and fruit. He does not 
cease, but carries on the work from the beginning to the 
end of the world. Therefore, you Christians who have 
been saved from death by the suffering, death and 
bloodshed of Christ are warned to escape from the 
murderer and liar. The soul lives in Christ, though the 
body rests for a time in the earth. For we are no longer 
under the liar and murderer, but under Christ, who is the 
truth and the life. Our soul lives through 


1328 


Five sermons on 1 Petr. Cap. 4 and 5. 


1329 





the truth, that is, by faith; for he, Christ, is the life. 
Although we are completed in body and soul, that we 
may live in heaven and in the flesh, we have not yet 
escaped, we are still under the dominion of the devil. 
However, as far as the soul is concerned, we are free. 
But we must take care that the devil does not kill us 
again and snatch away the life of the soul. It shall do you 
no harm that the soul is corrupt, and you are subject to 
death in the flesh. Christ lives, and we also must live, as 
it is written in John 14:19. Therefore fight and contend, 
abide in life and truth, lest the devil deceive you. 
Therefore he says, "Watch" not without cause. For you 
have an enemy, the devil, who first kills you in body and 
soul. You must resist him. If it were not for the fact that 
God had not put us into battle with the devil 1) we would 
already be in heaven. But the devil has not yet been 
judged, nor has he been pushed into the abyss of hell, 
so we Christians must be sober and watchful. For we do 
not defend ourselves physically, but by praying. In the 
world you see how Satan rumbles against the Christian 
faith. The Turk does nothing but murder, and he burns 
with murder. He drowns him who commits murder. So 
does the Frenchman. The world is almost nothing but 
murder, even if they are not Christians. That is why God 
has ordered the authorities and powers to be resisted. 
They should be sober and brave, but wait for the office. 
It is not for you alone to seek honor. That is not our 
particular concern. However, we should thank God that 
God has set the status of parents and authorities before 
the devil. Otherwise there would be no peace. The 
physical life is not yet saved. Even if a pious ruler rules 
well, he is not blessed. For he will have his eternal life 
only afterwards. Many "consider temporal prosperity" [2 
Pet 2:13]. But that the poor sack of maggots will live 
forever, the dominion of the world cannot help you. But 
even so, to the life that is here on earth... 


1) Buchwald: rushed. 


God has given parents rods and the sword to the 
authorities, so that they may be preserved. But here he 
teaches especially that we live in such a way that we do 
not die in body or soul. For there shall be no cloud 
between us and God and His angels. 

Our life has begun in body and soul. So now he says: 
"Watch", not only according to the body, but much more 
according to the soul. For a Christian who is a full sow, 
the devil has soon won and torn the word of God and the 
faith from his heart, so that he dies again in body and 
soul. One must be careful that the soul is not sleepy or 
drunk. Where the body will be full, a drunken soul will 
follow. But where the soul is strong, the body will go to 
church and hear God's word and pray. But if the body is 
full and slothful by heart, the soul will follow, not heeding 
what is preached or taught. If the body is full of 
drunkenness, the soul is also full of drunkenness, if we 
are sure and let the spirits of the devil get the upper 
hand. For the devil not only makes us drunk with the 
candelabra, but also in the spirit, so that he takes away 
our faith and doctrine. If you now believe firmly, are 
sober, brave and active, he thinks about how he can 
make you drunk and makes a spiritual drunkard out of 
you. This is how he holds up to us learned fairy tales that 
have a semblance of godliness. When the spirits of the 
wicked come to us, they pour us a drink. To drink and to 
eat is to teach and to believe. If one pours poison, it goes 
down well. If we live by it, we go to the devil. So we must 
not only watch carefully and live soberly in body, but also 
in soul. 

For Satan comes with a sweet, lovely wine, which is 
called human reason, is a beautiful mash, makes many 
boys, that one preaches something, so is not God's 
word, but a side doctrine, something new to think up next 
to it. That makes then that one despises God's word, if 
one is not sober and brave, that one believes, but one 
sleeps and is full, - from those he is not far away. Since 
Munzer got his peasants drunk, they should kill the 
godless authorities. For 


1330

1331 





He who is drunk with lies is also drunk with murder. 

"We have not followed wise fables," but "we have a 
firm prophetic word" [2 Pet. 1:16, 19]. It is true, it is 
wisely, reasonably, wisely given, as if someone 
preaches: You see how wicked the rulers are now, they 
are tyrants and despots, therefore they should be put to 
death. So also the Anabaptists say, "Is it not great 
blindness that a handful of water should cleanse the 
soul, otherwise a cow will drink of the water? Fie on the 
bath! That is wisely spoken. But he is the devil, who 
"walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may 
devour. Then reason says, "Water is water," and 
baptism is no better than other water, which the dog 
licks, and the soul is killed by the lie. For it is not pure 
water, but water put into God's word, since God speaks 
to us through baptism. 

Item, what is this, say the commentators, 1) that they 
give you bread baked in an oven, and wine grown on the 
vine? This is said very wisely and learnedly, and yet they 
are fairy tales. He who is not watchful and sober here 
will soon be deceived. Item: | lay my hand on your head, 
and you have forgiveness of sins. Reason says, "Are 
you mad and foolish? Shall this take away thy sin, if a 
fainting priest put forth his hand, or pour upon thee a 
handful of water? No, the spirit must do it! What should 
the word do? Don't you see that no fruit comes from it? 
Here you are not sober nor brave, otherwise you would 
say: | know well that the hand that is laid on the head 
does nothing. But what do you say to this, because God 
says: If you absolve, | will do it? - then he rolls over and 
says, "I didn't know. 

For this reason St. Peter says: "Resist it!" But one 
must be sober and courageous, and keep to the divine 
word. For our faith is thus determined by the

The reason of the devil is the bride of the devil. It is the 
reason of the devil's bride. If the emperor were so great 
as to say: My crown is a crown before God, and the 
philosophers and jurists said: The laws and rights are 
delicious things before God, - so | will stand before God! 
Before the world it shall be a crown; before GOD he shall 
leave the crown behind and say: Have mercy on me, 
God! So even those who have protection and a shield 
cannot boast that they pleased God because He 
commanded them the crown and the sword. Reason has 
the advantage that it is equipped with God's sayings, so 
that earthly wisdom pleases Him. But on the contrary, it 
is only on earth; in heaven it is said [1 Cor. 3:19], "The 
wisdom of this world is foolishness with God," and [1 
Cor. 1:19], "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise." So the 
parents' estate, the authority, which he has nevertheless 
confirmed and instituted, will not stand before him, much 
less will a crown or jurist's work ring a bell, or that thou 
shouldest reason and think out of thy heart, as the 
monks and Anabaptists do. Be wise in the place where 
you require a city or are placed in a household. It is still 
too little. Reason in law books still rules well, but before 
God it is not good enough for reason itself to choose 
something that should be valid before God. 

St. Peter says: they are "clever fables" [2 Petr. 1, 16], 
like putting on a cap. It is a quiet being: one gets away 
from housekeeping and city life, even from people, and 
one can lead a peaceful, quiet life. It is reasonable 
enough to abstain from all kinds of trouble, not to look at 
the least thing that happens in a house. That is truly a 
finely taught thing, but it is called an idle thing and 
useless drivel. Where do | see this from? By God's word, 
which says [Ps. 119:85]: "The proud dig pits for me that 
are not according to your law," 2) they preach to me well. 
But when | looked at it in the light, it was not as your law. 
How beautiful is the lie, it shines.

The truth is not so fine. That | hear God's word, believe, 
receive the sacrament, govern my house, does not 
seem as fine as a Carl house walking in its gray cap. The 
same shines; that is an excellent, beautiful lie. For it 
leaves the preachers and others in the sweat. In the old 
days, a preacher and priest were never so honored as a 
barefoot monk. For the cap and the plate have a greater 
prestige. 

Therefore, distinguish between what God has ordered 
and what reason has invented. | do not want to discard 
reason altogether. If reason is confirmed by God, 
accept it as: God has commanded parents to take care 
of how to raise their children. After that, see if reason is 
without God's word, even in worldly matters. A judge 
soon notices when another refuses to exercise his 
judicial office. So a householder soon notices when 
another wants to sleep with his wife. But if reason here 
goes against God's word, it can clean itself so that it is 
not soon known. If a shoemaker were to speak of his 
trade in the sermon, everyone would run out of the 
church and say, "What does this belong to the life of the 
soul? Go to your house and do your trade. But if one 
says: | have the Holy Spirit; it is not to be believed that 
water should cleanse the soul, that God and man are 
one thing, that the Virgin Mary is a mother, that if you die 
and are eaten by worms, you still say that you live, - one 
cannot say like that: Out of the church! You don't do that, 
because reason wins, if you don't take God's word. The 
Turk sneers at our fists, thinks that no geese are as 
foolish as we Christians. For the Turk thinks that we 
worship three gods, but that they are God's people. For 
they honor only One God. And as there is no more than 
One God in heaven, so he (the Turk) alone is a Lord on 
earth. See what the devil does and can do! They think 
they are the right people of God, and our people, when 
they are caught in Turkey, fall to their faith. After that 
(they say): that we believe that baptism 





But we get and fight in honor of our Lord God. The devil 
has deceived them into thinking that we call on three 
gods. We also know only of One God, who created 
heaven and earth. Whoever brings this sermon to the 
Turks, God will find him. 

In Arius, Macedonius and in the pope, there is vain 
reason. In short, it should be dead in Christ. One must 
resist the devil! How then? "Firm in faith! Because reason 
cannot exist without God's word. Therefore you will not 
resist the devil, but only with the divine word. Without it 
he will snatch away your blessedness, and if he gets a 
little space where he can crawl through with his head, the 
whole body will follow. Therefore resist him "firmly in 
faith" and learn to distinguish reason from faith and to 
speak: It may be well taught, but it is fables and fool's 
heiding, vain fairy tales and lies, for God's word is not 
there. But they say: A virgin can not be a mother. 
Likewise Brod cannot be Leijob. There the reason is 
caught and must give such thoughts applause. But say 
thou, If reason shall teach me, why do we not leave the 
gospel and the book of the holy scriptures, and cast them 
away from us? We preach something higher than reason 
can comprehend. Yes, we show reason that the wisdom 
of the world is called foolishness before God. If you want 
to understand by reason that baptism washes away sins, 
what can | believe? 1) If | can understand with my reason 
that a mother can be a virgin, then St. Gabriel may be 
silent and may not proclaim it to me. 

It is not enough for one to be learned, wise and 
prudent, and to insist and defy God. St. Paul says [1 Cor. 
2, 5] that faith does not stand on human wisdom, but on 
divine wisdom. These are just the intrigues and 
intricacies, so that the

reason that baptism washes away sins, there would be no need for

Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. Peter. 


1335 





Devil seeks to devour us. He does not say: If you put on 
a cap, you will go to the devil. Behold, what a wretched 
and miserable creature there is in the world among all 
classes! Therefore we must be sober, not only in body, 
but also in soul, so that we cannot keep enough to the 
word of God, and be sure that "the devil walks about as 
a roaring lion. You have not a little adversary, but the 
devil, whom Christ [John 12:31] calls a "prince of this 
world,” and St. Paul [2 Cor. 4:4] a "god of this world," 
who has great wisdom, and has reason beforehand that 
we should believe him gladly. You cannot escape from 
this same strong spirit, if you follow reason, which says: 
There is water with the dear God; water is water. But if 
you are awake, you can say, There is one in the water, 
who is called the Holy Spirit. So also in the Lord's 
Supper, you must not judge according to what reason 
sees and has, but hold up to it the wisdom of God and 
the Holy Spirit. There the devil flees, because the world 
becomes too narrow for him. Do not worry then, if you 
are well instructed and equipped with God's word, that 
he will stay with you for a long time! He is not only wise 
and prudent, but also evil, and is called "our adversary," 
who is still in this body and soul. But through Christ we 
overcome him. He cannot stand him, and wants to say 
to St. Peter: Only do not think that he is far from you, but 
know that he is so near to you that you have to struggle 
with your firm faith to keep yourselves from him. For he 
is in your chamber, in your flesh. This one he tempts with 
unbelief, that one with murder, that one with fornication. 
When you look at his works, you see him very near. 
Behold, how he deceiveth and deceiveth the Turk, and 
the pope, and the rats, and us that are alive, that it were 
better that we should live 1). For the devil is such an 
adversary, 


1) "bethdrt" and "betriigt" put by us instead of: "bethdre" and 
"betrige”. 





who fights against us day and night. He will not press us 
much or do us harm who is over a mile from us, but who 
is near us. And especially in matters of faith he is so near 
that he contends with you without ceasing. Therefore be 
firm! For all around he seeks you until he finds you, seeks 
a gap and climbs over the fence, since he is low, now 
with adultery, soon with wrath, and will not come, so he 
comes with avarice, impatience, doubt and with other 
sins. He does not celebrate, but creeps around where he 
can catch one, so that if he does not catch you with one 
sin, he will have another ready to devour you. And this is 
no joke to him. He does not want to play with you, but is 
angry as a roaring lion, and as hungry as a lion may be. 
He will not give you a blow or a thrust, but will devour you 
so that nothing heavenly or earthly will remain with you. 
And that is why St. Peter warns us so earnestly, 
especially the preachers. For no one can resist him, 
except in faith, that is, through the word of God. If you let 
this go, as our adversaries do, then it is over for you. And 
he does not fight with them, because they do not fight 
back; he has not even eaten the papist theologians and 
the jurists. But what is under Christ, hears God's word 
and practices it, prays and is careful that the word of God 
is not taken away from him, to them he clings. For the 
others are safe, thinking that the devil is in Babylon, and 
2) indulging in all kinds of sins. But he walketh about hard 
with you, and controverteth you, and is wroth, and will not 
give a hoot, but devoureth. But we must defend 
ourselves with faith. Item, if we do not want to follow 
reason, he is such a cunning spirit that he puts on the 
holy Scriptures and adorns himself as an "angel of light" 
[2 Cor. 11:14]. Now this is another sermon.

Five sermons on 1 Petr. Cap. 4 and 5. 


1337 





Fifth sermon on 1 Peter 5:9. 


Held on the 6th Sunday after Trinity, July 13, 1539. 


You have heard that the devil is our adversary, and 
how he does not rest, but goes about and is valiant, not 
that he will scold us, but it is a matter of life or eternal 
death. Thus he deals especially with Christians who are 
called to the kingdom of Christ and hold to the seed 
given. For in short, he does not want to suffer Christ. So 
we are not placed in the state of Christianity to be safe, 
but to be brave, and to diligently practice, hear and pray 
the word of God. It follows further: 

"And know that the same sufferings are upon your 
brethren which are in the world." This is a precious 


saying, which he not only speculated from the Holy 
Spirit, but also from experience, as he had been in the 
Hanse Caipha and denied the Lord Christ three times, 
as he was in such despair and fear that if Christ had not 
looked at him, he would have followed Judae's example. 
But after the resurrection, the Lord called Mary 
Magdalene to go to Petro for the first time. And to him 
he also says in the supper [Luc. 22, 32.]: "But | have 
prayed for thee, that thy faith cease not. And if thou be 
converted some day, strengthen thy brethren." This is 
what St. Peter does especially in this place, 
strengthening his brothers, saying, "You have to suffer. 
And in the first tablet there is true suffering. In the other 
table there is suffering, although it is also hard, as when 
one is deprived of goods, house, farm, and body. Some 
become mad and foolish over it. Another has a suffering, 
as a lewd heat, because flesh and blood wallet. For the 
devil seeks everyone with his temptation. Youth has its 
own special temptation. The old also have their own 
plague. 

But it is still nothing against the temptation, since 
here St. Peter says about it. In the other table, the other 
temptations are felt, and men understand them for what 
they are. Item, if someone is attacked with avarice, he is 
concerned about money, and all are temptations, which 
are understandable. Dar 


after one is strong, then God gives him a cross. A child 
cannot carry a sword. The high Christian temptations are 
so high and heavy that they cannot be understood, 
especially those that go against the first commandment. 

| have heard that some have been in monasteries 
who have not felt any challenge. That is why they asked 
God to send them a challenge. Now this challenge was 
given to them, so that they dreamt that they were in 
Rome at the singing dances. When they wanted to be 
delivered from the temptation, another one was given to 
them against the first tablet. Then they would have 
desired the first challenge again. For the temptations 
against the first tablet are very dangerous, such as: that 
one should doubt and disbelieve in God, blasphemy and 
others, which | must not mention for the sake of those 
who have not tried them, and then a man will faint and 
wither inwardly, and those who are to become pastors 
may pay good attention to this text. 

"And know that these same sufferings are upon your 
brethren which are in the world." Learn this, he wants to 
say, now | have preached about the devil. This you will 
also learn. Therefore, when these things happen to you, 
do not think that you are alone, nor are you the first. For 


Gaudium est miseris socium habere in poenis. 1) 
And St. Peter consoles you greatly out of measure, 
namely, that not one alone, but the whole Christian 
church suffers in the world, as he said in the fourth 
chapter [v. 12]: "Beloved, do not let the heat which 
befalls you (which befalls you, that you are tempted) be 
strange to you, as if something strange were happening 
to you," as if it were a new and strange thing to us. Do 
not say, "I have a strange cross that others do not have. 
No, your brothers will have to suffer the same in India 
and France. But the devil takes hold of some in 


for the unfortunate to have a fellow sufferer in their

Interpretations on the 1st 


Epistle of St. Peter. 1339 





He is especially interested in those who are not plagued 
with carnal desires (for the young fellows have enough 
to bear), and he chases the men into misery. But if he 
comes and seizes you alone and gives you blasphemous 
thoughts, know that he cannot attack you so shamefully, 
remember that you are not alone! It would not be good, 
nor tolerable, that a young journeyman should have and 
bear the cross of St. Peter and St. Paul. But when it 
comes to the high temptations, that one does not say and 
think that he has such a temptation to despair or to hate 
God, that God wants to judge and condemn him. The 
devil's rule is like this, and some think: Peter and Paul 
did not suffer such things that | suffer. 

| have seen a virgin who had this mentation: when 
she was in the church and saw that the sacrament had 
been elevated, she would have thought to herself, what 
a great sham the priest is raising, and was then 
frightened by this thought, that she had sunk down. Then 
she might have said: | alone have the suffering. 
Therefore St. Peter comforts us that others also have 
suffering, as he himself was admonished and reminded 
of it by the Lord Christ, Luke 22:32. 32, when he says: "I 
have prayed for you that your faith may not cease. And 
when thou shalt be converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
Even though the pope uses this saying to confirm his 
power, sovereignty and dominion, St. Peter comforts the 


brethren by the command of Christ. It is said: Confirma 


fratres, 1) not: Be a lord of the whole world! 

But let no one think, "Oh, how grievous and terrible a 
trial | must suffer, and that thou shouldest suffer 
something strange and new," but say, "Praise be to God. 
It is not only me, we must be made perfect through such 
suffering. The martyrs were thus challenged more 
strangely than you may be. No heart will consider or say 
what Adam suffered when God said to him, "Adam, 
where are you?" It is undescribed and will probably 
remain undescribed. It will also remain undiscussed and 
unspoken. 


1) le. Strengthen your brothers. 
2) Buchwald: "sonderlichs Neues. Cf. in this volume Col. 1292. 


land therefore you see that Adam and Eve never came 
together for thirty years after the fall, nor would they have 
come together if they had not been reminded by an 
langel. Therefore, when Adam comes to disputation with 
us on the last day, we will confess that we are disciples 
against him, but that he is our father. So also of the other 
prophets and patriarchs. But with Adam and Eve it was 
most annual, for they had no examples for themselves to 
hold on to and comfort themselves. 

No one says, "It is too horrible! No one has suffered 
las much as | have. Nay, know, if thou be a Christian, that 
thou sufferest not alone, but all thy brethren that are with 
thee in this life, not they that are dead. The Christians in 
India also have examples of this suffering. For they also 
have the same devil who seeks to devour them, they also 
have the same Christ whom the devil hates, and for 
whose sake we must suffer. Therefore say, | not only 
suffer, but the whole Christian church also suffers with 
me, which liveth and shall live at the last day. 

It is a glorious consolation that the Christian church 
suffers with us. For the devil does not seek me alone, but 
las he seeks me, so he seeks others also. Therefore, pray 
land be comforted, as it was said to St. Peter, "Strengthen 
Your brothers." 

Ages ago, | thought: | wanted to dispute with St. Peter 
land Paul who had had the greatest suffering. | have often 
not been able to solve the devil's argument, but have 
pointed to Christ. And when Christ leaves us, he is far too 
strong for us. He has such great power and wisdom that 
it is not possible for a Christian to silence his arguments, 
rebuttals and refutations, unless the Holy Spirit is with 
him and gives him a saying to meet him. He often repels 
all my art and takes the sword from my fist and fights 
lagainst me with my own defense. Because of this, the 
red spirits and safe people are poor, miserable drops. 
When they read and look at their thoughts, they are so 
sure that they think they have eaten God. That is why 
they also create hordes and have no experience of what 
ithe devil is like.

| only say: | know that | am more learned than any other 
doctor. 1) But | give this testimony to the devil that he 
often knocks me down. But this he does with them, that 
he makes the glass red. They swear by it, they also 
firmly believe that this is God's word, they do not think 
that they have a colored and painted glass in front of 
their eyes. Then he lets it be good for them, does not 
take it away from them, so that 2) they stand firm. This 
is a sure sign that they do not know the devil. 

Muenzer was also so firm that he said: | would not 
look at Christ if he did not speak to me. 3) Now, because 
the devil does not attack them, they stand firm. The right 
Christians, when they are tempted, stand in great fears, 
so that they do not take up the sword. [4) As some say, 
"God will not take this away from me. Therefore those 
who are so stiffnecked and can eat the devil are not, 
unless the Holy Spirit is with them and helps them, and 
they are soon devoured. Therefore, the godly are often 
weak and complain about it, as St. Paul does to the 
Romans in chapter 7. The others have done it long ago. 

Therefore learn this admonition, that you may also 
comfort the weak. The devotees have long eaten the 
devil, but they have been devoured by the devil seven 
times over. Arius, who caused the chaos that in Europe 
only two bishops remained steadfast and did not 
consent to his blasphemy against Christ, also said: "Oh, 
| must suffer! This must be for the sake of the truth, 
which overcomes everything. But his bishop at 
Alexandria punished his error and defended that Christ 
was not only a creature but also the Creator. This was 
Arius' suffering, that he was not allowed to be justified in 
blaspheming and desecrating Christ. For the bishop 
said, "You do wrong to spread this blasohemy among 
the people.

So Munzer was also a martyr, that his rebellion was 
rejected. So our antinomians also become martyrs. For 
they have heard that the church should suffer, but why? 
That they should blaspheme God's word? But the 
Christian church does not suffer like them. For the 
Christians do not pride themselves and do not insist in 
this way. The others do not feel any challenge. They also 
speak of Duke George as having suffered great 
persecution. But he proved the opposite. Why? Because 
they do not want to allow him to kill and exterminate our 
teachings. Thus a harlot is also a great martyr, because 
one does not want to confess to her that she commits 
fornication. Kohlhas 5) is also a great martyr because 
the prince is after him. 6) Isn't it a disagreeable thing that 
those who do harm, who seduce souls, still want to be 
holy and martyrs? 

St. Peter has enough to comfort those who are in high 
temptations. They need it to be said to them that they 
are right, for otherwise they doubt whether they are right. 
But thou needest not do as the ruffians do, that it may 
yet be right, if it disquiet a thousand devils. But 
Christians are not like that, but often lose God our Father 
and the Lord Christ in the high temptations. Then it is 
necessary to say: Confirma fratres in terris! 7) No, you 
are not alone who suffer, and what happens to you also 
happened to me. 8) If you do not want to believe it, look 
into the palace of Caipha [Matth. 26, 69. ff.]. | also said 
at first, | will go into prison with the Lord Christ and die 
with him. But when the maid came, And said, Thou also 
art one of the Galileans, - O, then knew | not the man.

So Christians are not hopeful, proud, stubborn, 
remain in humility when they are strengthened and 
made stiff. | am now talking about the high temptations,

| have to become more humiliated, even for the sake of 
the other common people, so that one can say: Do not 
despair, hold on! No one is so martyred as | am. No, do 
not say so! Have you not seen what the first parents 
suffered? Read the Bible, what have all the saints 
suffered! St. Peter says that you alone do not suffer. It is 
nothing new that happens to you. But one says: It is truly 
new to me. But listen: others have it too. St. Peter has

than others. But the epistle to the Hebrews in chapter 12 
[v. 4] says that no one sweated blood, neither Peter nor 
Paul, but he. 

So say now, when the high temptations come: | will 
let him answer who has sweated blood for me. Again, 
because the red glass is before our eyes, we see nothing 
but red. Our temptations cannot be so evil as the 
apostles and especially the Lord Christ. Therefore do not 
doubt, say: | also belong to the round dance and will also 
hold the title, and will also be a fellowoffer of the following 
blessedness. Therefore we cannot suffer such evil: we 
have brothers and companions, St. Peter, Paul, all the 
prophets, patriarchs and especially Christ. 


XI. D. Martin Luther's interpretations of the second 


epistle of 


St. Peter. 


The second epistle of St. Peter preached and interpreted. *) 
Preached in 1523, printed in 1524. 


Preface.

the righteous, pure doctrine of faith would be falsified, 
obscured, and suppressed; and he wanted to counter 
two kinds of error, which come from unrighteous 


2) Wittenberger: because. 


The first is to follow the teaching of faith in the true 
sense, and to defend both sides, namely, not to give 
works the power to make one pious and pleasing in the 
sight of God, which belongs to faith; and again, not to let 
anyone think that faith can be without good works. For 
when one preaches of faith that it is 


*) In 1523 Luther preached on Sunday afternoons on the first and second epistle of St. Peter and on the epistle of St. Jude, as has 
already been said in the first note on the interpretation of the first epistle of St. Peter. The first single edition of our epistle was published in 
1524 in Wittenberg by Hans Lufft under the title: "Die ander Epistel S. Petri vnd eyne S. Judas gepredigt vnd ausgelegt durch Mart. Luther. 
Wittemberg D. XxXiIlll." In the same year two more single printings followed without indication of place and printer under the same title; one 
printing appeared at Strasbourg. In the collections: Wittenberger (1556), vol. I, p. 549; Jenaer (1585), vol. Il, p. 371; Altenburger, vol. Il, p. 
464; Leipziger, vol. XI, p. 546; and Erlanger, vol. 52, p. 212. The Latin translation is found in the Latin Wittenberger, Dom. V, lol. 485. We give 
the text according to the Jena edition, comparing the Latin Wittenberger and the Erlanger. The German Wittenberg edition has allowed itself 
great changes not only in the preface, but also in the interpretation, which is why we must dispense with an indication of the variants. We have 


given a few samples of them in the beginning. 


1344 Erl. 52, 213-215. 
without all the addition of works, people say that one 
must not do any work, as we see from daily experience; 
and again, if one falls on works and lifts them up, then 
faith must lie low, so that the middle road is difficult to 
maintain here where there are not righteous preachers. 
Now we have always taught that faith alone justifies 1) 
and sanctifies before God. After that, when faith is 
present, good works should and must follow from it; 2) 
since it is not possible that we should walk idly in this life 
and do no work. 


1) Wittenberger: just. 

2) From here on, the Wittenberg edition omits our preface and 
adds Luther's preface to the second epistle of St. Peter with a few 
introductory words (Walch, alte Ausg., Bd. XI V, 144). 


Sermon On 2 Petr. 1, 1. 2. 


W. IX, 833-836. 1345 


2 In this epistle, St. Peter also teaches and confronts 
those who might have taken a wrong understanding 
from the previous epistle: it would be enough to believe 
if one did no works. And against these especially goes 
the first chapter, in which he teaches that believers 
should test themselves by good works, and become 
certain of their faith. The other chapter is against those 
who are strict about works and suppress faith. Therefore 
he warns against the false teachers of the future, who 
would completely destroy the faith through the teachings 
of men. For he has well seen what a terrible seduction 
would become in the world; as it already began, as St. 
Paul says 2 Thess. 2, 7: "The secret of wickedness is 
already stirring. So this epistle is written to us as a 
warning that we prove faith by good works, that is, that 
we do not trust in works. 


The first chapter.

Christ, to those who have come to the same faith with

this epistle, that it may be known who is writing and to 
whom he is writing, namely, to those who have heard 
God's word and stand in faith. 4) But what kind of faith 
is it? "In the righteousness (he says) that God gives." 
There he gives justification 5) to faith alone, as St. Paul 
also Rom. 1, 17: "In the gospel is revealed the 
righteousness that is valid before God, which comes 
from faith"; 6) as it is written [Hab. 2, 4.]: "The just shall 
live by his faith." With this St. Peter wants to admonish 
them to be prepared, and the teaching

5) Wittenberger: "he gives justice". 

6) Wittenberger: which comes from faith in faith. 





of faith, which they have now grasped and know well. 

(2) And by adding "in the righteousness which God 
gives," he separates all human righteousness. For by 
faith alone are we justified before God; wherefore also 
faith is called the righteousness of God, for it is of no 
account before the world, yea, it is also condemned. 7) 

Grace and peace multiply among you through the 
knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord. 

3 This is the greeting that is written at the beginning 
of the letters, and it means the following: | wish you, 
instead of my ministry, to increase in grace and peace, 
and to become richer and richer; which grace comes 
from the knowledge of God and of the Lord Christ, which 
no one can have.

who has the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ. 

4 The knowledge of God is always referred to by the 
apostles and the prophets in the Scriptures, as Isaiah, 
Cap. 11, 9.They shall not hurt nor choke in all my 
mountain; for the land is filled with the knowledge of God, 
as the land is covered with water," that is, the knowledge 
of God will break out as abundantly as when water pours 
out and breaks away, drowning a whole land; from this 
will follow such peace that no one will hurt or harm 
another. Now this is not called knowing God, that you 
believe, as the Turks, Jews, and devils believe, that God 
created all things; item, that Christ was born of a virgin, 
suffered, died, and rose again; but this is the right 
knowledge, when you believe and know that God and 
Christ are your God and your Christ; which the devil and 
false Christians cannot believe. 1) Thus knowledge is 
nothing else than righteous Christian faith. For if you 
know God and Christ in this way, you will also rely on 
Him with all your heart and trust Him in happiness and 
misfortune, in life and death. The evil consciences 
cannot have such trust, for they do not recognize God 
beyond the fact that he is the God of St. Peter and of all 
the saints in heaven; but they do not recognize him as 
their God, but consider him to be their master of the rod 
and their wrathful judge. 

5. to have God is to have all grace, all mercy, and 
everything that can be called good. To have Christ is to 
have the Savior and Mediator who has brought us to the 
point that God is ours, and has purchased for us all grace 
from Him. You must intertwine these things so that Christ 
may be yours and you yours, and then you will have a 
righteous knowledge. A woman who lives without 
marriage may well say that this is a man, but she cannot 
say that he is her husband: so 1) we all may well say that 
this is a God, but we do not all say that he is our God. 
For we cannot all put our trust in him, nor 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: could. 





comfort us. To this knowledge also belongs that the 


Scripture calls faciem et vultum Domini, the face of 
the Lord, of which the prophets speak much. He who 
does not see God's face does not know Him, but sees 
only His back, that is, an angry and ungracious God. 

(6) And here you see that St. Peter does not 
particularly intend to write about faith, since he did so 
sufficiently in the first epistle, but wants to exhort the 
faithful to show their faith by good works. For he does 
not want faith without good works, nor again, works 
without faith, but faith beforehand, and good works on 
and from faith. Therefore he speaks thus: 


V. 3. after all of His divine power (which is for life 
and godly living) has been given to us. 


(7) This is the first part where Peter begins to write 
what we have received from God through faith, namely, 
that (since we have known God through faith) "all divine 
power" has been given to us. But what kind of power is 
it? It is such power that serves us for life and godly walk, 
that is, when we believe, we come upon so much that 
God gives us all kinds of His power. It is in us and with 
us: what we speak and do, we do not do, but God does 
it Himself. He is strong, powerful and omnipotent in us, 
even though we suffer and die and are weak before the 
world, so that there is neither strength nor ability in us if 
we do not have this power of God. 

8 But this power of God that is in us is not meant by 
St. Peter to mean that we should also create heaven and 
earth and do such miracles as God does, for what would 
that help us? But we have God's power with us as far as 
it is useful and necessary for us. Therefore the apostle 
adds, "That which is for life and godly living," that is, we 
have such power from God, by which we are abundantly 
endowed to do good and to live forever. 2) The apostle 
says, "We have the power of God with us. 


2) "to" stands alone in the Wittenberg. 


1348 En. ss, 217-219. 


Sermon on 2 Petr. 1, 3. 4. W. Ix, 839-812. 


1349 





Through the knowledge of Him who called 
us. 


9 Such God's power and great mercy come from no 
other source than this knowledge of God. For if you 
consider him to be a God, he also acts with you as a 
God. Paul also says in 1 Cor. 1:5-7: "You have been 
enriched in every way with every word and knowledge, 
since 1) the preaching of Christ has been strengthened 
in you, so that now you have no lack. Now this is the 
greatest, noblest and most necessary thing that God can 
give us, for which we should not take everything that is 
in heaven and on earth. For what good would it be if you 
could "go through fire and water and perform all kinds of 
miracles" and not have that? Many people who perform 
such miracles are also condemned. But this is above all 
miracles, that God gives us such power that all our sins 
are forgiven and destroyed, death, the devil, and hell are 
overcome and swallowed up, that we may have a 
fearless conscience and a merry heart, and not be afraid 
of any thing. 


By his glory and virtue. 


(10) How did the calling come about, by which we are 
called by God? Thus, God sent forth and preached the 
holy gospel into the world, for which no man labored 
beforehand, nor did he ask or plead with him; but before 
any man thought of it, he offered, gave, and abundantly 
poured out such grace to us, that he alone might have 
the glory and praise of it, and we alone might ascribe to 
him the virtue and power, for it is not our work, but his 
alone. Therefore, since the work is not ours, let us not 
be ashamed as if we had done it, but let us praise and 
thank him for giving us the gospel, and through it giving 
us strength and power against the devil, death and all 
calamities. 


V. 4. by which 2) the most precious and 
greatest promises are given to us. 

(11) St. Peter adds this to explain the nature and 
manner of faith. If we recognize him as God, then 
through faith we have eternal life and divine life. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: "des". 
2) Jenaer and Erlanger: which. 





We have the power to overcome death and the devil, but 
we see it and do not grasp it; but it is promised to us; we 
have it all, but it does not yet appear; but on the last day 
we shall see it presently. Here it begins in faith, but we 
do not have it completely; but we have the promise that 
we will live here in divine power, and after that we will be 
eternally blessed. He therefore that believeth, hath it; he 
that believeth not, hath it not, and must be eternally lost. 
Peter goes on to say what a great and precious thing 
this is, saying: 


Namely, that through the same you may become 
fellow members of the divine nature, if you flee the 
perishable lusts of the world. 


(12) This we have (he says) by the power of faith, that 
we are partakers, and have fellowship or communion 
with the divine nature. This is such a saying, the like of 
which is not found in the New and Old Testaments, 
though it is a small thing among unbelievers that we 
should have fellowship with the divine nature itself. But 
what is God's nature? It is eternal truth, righteousness, 
wisdom, eternal life, peace, joy and pleasure, and what 
can be called good. Whoever is made a partaker of 
God's nature has all this, that he lives forever and has 
eternal peace, joy and pleasure, and is pure, clean, 
righteous and almighty against the devil, sin and death. 
Therefore Peter wants to say: As little as God can be 
taken away, that he is not eternal life and eternal truth, 
so little can it be taken away from you. If anyone does 
anything to you, it must be done to him; for he who wants 
to oppress a Christian must oppress God. 

(13) All these things are comprehended in the little 
word "God's nature," and he also used it for this reason, 
that he might comprehend all these things; and it is truly 
a great thing when it is believed. But these, as | said 
above, are all instructions, so that he does not lay a 
foundation of faith, but emphasizes what great and 
abundant goods we get through faith; therefore he says, 
"You will have all these things if you live in such a way 
that you prove faith by fleeing worldly pleasures. He 
continues in this way: 


1350 


Eri. SL, [so-222. 


Interpretations on the 2nd epistle of St. Peter. w. ix, 842-844. 


1351 





V. 5: So put all your diligence into it, and in your 
faith give virtue. 


14 Here now St. Peter takes up the exhortation that 
they should prove faith with good works, since such 
great good has been given to you through faith (he 
means to say) that you truly have all that is God's; 
therefore do so, be diligent and not slothful: "Abound in 
your faith in virtue," that is, let your faith break forth 
before men, that it may be serviceable, busy, strong, and 
active, and do many works, not remaining slothful and 
unfruitful. You have a good inheritance and a good field, 
but see to it that you do not let thistles or weeds grow in 
it. 


And in the virtue of modesty. 


15 "Modesty" or knowledge is, first of all, that one 
leads the outward life and the virtue of faith with reason. 
For one should force and tame the body so far that it 
remains sober, brave and skillful for good, not that one 
hurts and strangles it, as some mad saints do. For 
though God is like the sins that remain in the flesh, yet 
he does not want you to strangle the body for it; you shall 
resist its mischievousness and wantonness, but you 
shall not spoil it nor harm it for that reason, but give it its 
food and need, that it may remain healthy and alive. On 
the other hand, this also means modesty, that one leads 
a fine modest life, and drives with reason in external 
things, as in food, and the like, so that one does nothing 
with unreasonableness, and gives no annoyance to the 
neighbor. 


V. 6. and in modesty temperance. 


16 "Temperance" is not only in eating and drinking, 
but a measure in all conduct and behavior, words, works 
and deeds, so that one does not live too lavishly, and 
avoids the excess of adornment and clothing, so that no 
one breaks out 1) too gloriously, and ranges too high. 
But St. Peter does not want to set a rule, measure or 
goal for this, as the orders have subjected themselves 
to, who want to have it all with rules. 


1) Jenaer: hervor. 





and commandments were laid upon them, which were to 
pass through and through. It is not fitting in Christendom 
that laws should be laid down, that a common rule 
should be laid down for temperance; for men are 
unequal one to another, one being of a strong and 
another of a weak nature, and none of all things always 
as skillful as another. Therefore let each man judge for 
himself how he is able and what he can bear. 2) 


And in moderation patience. 


17 Thus St. Peter says: If you live a moderate and 
modest life, do not think that you will live without 
temptation and persecution. For if ye believe, and walk 
a good Christian walk, the world will not leave it alone; it 
must persecute you and be against you; in which ye 
must have patience, which is the fruit of faith. 


And in patience godliness. 


18) This is that in all outward life, whatever we do or 
suffer, we keep ourselves so that we serve God in it, not 
seeking our own honor and benefit, but that God alone 
may be glorified by it; and that we place ourselves so 
that it may be seen 3) that we do everything for God's 
sake. 


V. 7. and in godliness brotherly love. 


(19) St. Peter binds us with this, that we should all 
reach out to one another as brothers, and that one 
should take care of the other, and that none should be 
the enemy of the other, nor despise or offend. This is 
also a proof of faith, that we may testify that we have the 
godliness of which he said. 


And in brotherly love, common love. 


20 Common love goes both over friends and 
enemies, even over those who are not friendly and 
brotherly toward us. Thus, St. Peter has written here in 
short words what belongs to a Christian life, 


2) Jenaer and Erlanger: could.

1353 


W. IX, 844-847. 





and what are the works and fruits of faith, modesty, 
temperance, patience, a godly life, brotherly love, and 
being pleasant to everyone. Therefore, he now 
continues: 


V. 8 For if these things abound among you, they 
will not make you slothful or unfruitful in the 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 


(21) That is, if ye do such works, ye are of the right 
course, and have a righteous faith, and the knowledge 
of Christ is active and fruitful in you. Therefore see to it 
that you do not throw these things to the winds, constrain 
your bodies, and also do to your neighbors as you know 
Christ has done to you. 


V. 9 But he who is not ready for these things is 
blind, groping with his hand, forgetting the cleansing 
of his former sins. 

22. He that hath not such a store of the fruits of faith, 
groping to and fro like a blind man, standing in such a 
life, that he knoweth not his place, having not righteous 
faith, and having no more of the knowledge of Christ, 
than that he can tell how he hath heard it; Therefore he 
goes and gropes, like a blind man by the way, in an 
uncertain life, and forgets that he is baptized, and that 
his sins are forgiven him, and becomes ungrateful, and 
a lazy, negligent man, who lets nothing go to his heart, 
and neither feels nor tastes such great grace and goods. 

(23) This is the exhortation of St. Peter, to provoke 
and urge us who believe to works, that we may prove 
that faith is true in us, always maintaining that faith alone 
justifies. Where then it is, works must follow. What 
follows will be part of the strengthening. 


V. 10. Dam, dear brethren, do the more diligently 
to establish your profession and election. 

(24) The election and eternal provision of God is firm 
enough in itself that it cannot be made firm; the calling is 
also strong and firm. For whosoever heareth and 
believeth in the gospel, and is baptized, is called and 
saved. Because we then 





Now that we have also been called to this, we should be 
so diligent (says St. Peter) that our calling and election 
may also be firm with us, and not only with God. 

(25) Now this is such a way of speaking the 
Scriptures, as St. Paul says in Eph. 2:12: "Ye were 
sojourners in the testaments of promise, that ye had no 
hope, and were without God in the world. For although 
there is no man, either evil or good, over whom God is 
not Lord, since all creatures are his, yet Paul says that 
he has no God who does not know him, love him, and 
trust in him, even though he himself remains God. So 
also here, although the calling and election is strong 
enough in itself, it is not strong and firm with you, 
because you are not yet sure that it concerns you. 
Therefore Peter wants us to make such a calling and 
election firm for ourselves with good works. 

26 Thus you see what this apostle gives to the fruits 
of faith. Although these belong to the neighbor, so that 
he may be served by them, yet the fruit is not left out, so 
that faith becomes stronger through it, and does more 
and more good works. So this is a much different power 
than the bodily. For the bodily strength decreases and is 
consumed when one needs and does one thing too 
much; but this spiritual strength, the more one practices 
and does it, the stronger it becomes and decreases 
when one does not do it. That is why God first led, drove 
and exercised Christianity with the struggle of faith, in 
disgrace, death and bloodshed, so that it would become 
quite strong and powerful, and the more it was pressed, 
the more it went over itself. This is what St. Peter means, 
that one should not let the faith rest and lie still, because 
it is so skillful that it becomes more and more strong by 
being driven and exercised, until it becomes certain of 
its calling and election, and cannot fail. 

(27) And here also a goal is set, how one is to deal 
with the transgression. There are many careless spirits 
who have not felt much of faith, who fall in, bump into 
the top, and first worry about this thing, and want to find 
out by reason whether they are provided for, so that they 
may be sure where they stand. Only soon stop this. 


1354 Erl. 52, SL4-LL6. 
it is not the handle to it. But if you want to be sure, you 
must come to it by the way that St. Peter proposes to 
you here. If you take any other way, you have already 
failed; your own experience must teach you. If faith is 
well exercised and pursued, then you will finally be sure 
that you are not lacking, as follows: 


For if you do this, you will not fall. 

That is, you will stand firm, neither stumble nor sin, 
but go through it properly and freshly, and everything will 
work itself out. Otherwise, if you want to direct it with 
your thoughts, the devil will soon plunge you into despair 
and hatred of God. 


V.11. And so the entrance to the eternal kingdom 
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be 
abundantly presented to you. 


This is the road by which one enters the kingdom of 
heaven; therefore let no one take it into his mind to enter 
by such a dream and thought of faith, which he himself 
has invented in his heart; it must be a living, well- 
practiced and driven faith. Help God, how our deceivers 
have written, taught and said against this text: Whoever 
has even the least degree and only a spark of faith, if he 
is to die, he will be blessed. If thou wilt save it, and get 
such faith so suddenly and swiftly, thou shalt have 
tarried too long. Do you hear that those who are strong 
have enough to send? But one should not despair of 
such weak ones. For it may well happen that they come 
through, but it will be hard and difficult, and will cost 
much effort. But he that practiseth well in life, that his 
faith be urged and strengthened with good works, shall 
have an abundant entrance, and shall go into that life 
with good courage and confidence, so that he dieth 
defiantly, and despiseth life, and goeth straightway with 
glory, and leapeth into it with joy. But those, where they 
enter otherwise, will not so go with joy, the door of which 
will be closed. 


Interpretations on the 2nd epistle of St. Peter. w. Ix, 847-849. 





1355 


will not be so wide open to them, nor will they have such 
an abundant entrance, but will become narrow and sour 
to them that they will fidget, and would rather be weak 
all their lives than die one day. 


V. 12. Therefore I will not neglect to remind you 
of these things at all times, even though you know 
them and are strengthened in the present truth. 


(30) This is what we have often said: Although God 
has now shed such great light through the revelation of 
the Gospel that we know what a righteous Christian life 
and doctrine is, and see how all the Scriptures urge it; 
nevertheless, one should not cease, but should do the 
same daily, not for the sake of doctrine, but for the sake 
of remembrance. For there are two kinds of ministry in 
Christendom, as St. Paul says Rom. 12:7, 8: "If any man 
teach, let him wait for doctrine; if any man exhort, let him 
wait for exhortation." "Teaching" is when one lays the 
foundation of faith, and proclaims it to those who know 
not of it. "But to exhort," or, as Peter says here, "to 
remind," is to preach to those who know and have heard 
it before, that one had on and awaken them, that they 
not forsake it, but continue and increase. We are all 
burdened with the old, rotten sack, with our flesh and 
blood, which always wants the wrong way, always pulls 
us down to itself, so that the soul easily falls asleep. 
Therefore we must always drive and stop, as a 
householder drives the household, so that they do not 
become lazy, even though they know what they should 
do. For since one must do this for the sake of temporal 
nourishment, much more must one do it here in spiritual 
matters. 


V. 13. For I count it expedient, as long as I am in 
this tabernacle, to awaken and remind you. 


(31) St. Peter calls his body "a tabernacle" in which 
the soul dwells, and is speaking in the same way as in 
the first epistle [Cap. 3, 7] he calls a female body a 
vessel or armor. St. Paul also says in 2 Cor. 5, 1. 2. 4: 
"We know, if our earthly house of this tabernacle is 
broken, that we have a building constructed by God, a 
house not made with hands, which is eternal in heaven. 
And 


1356 Erl. 52, 228-229. sermon on 2 Pet. 1, 13-18. w. ix. 849-852. 


1357 





above which we also long for our dwelling place, which 
is from heaven. For while we are in the tabernacle, we 
long" 2c. Item, v. 6-8: "But we are confident, knowing 
that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent 
from the Lord: but we rather desire to be absent from the 
body, and to be at home with the Lord.” The apostle Paul 
also calls the body a house, and makes two homes and 
two pilgrimages. So Peter calls the body a tabernacle in 
which the soul rests. And makes it small enough, will not 
call it a house, but a little house and barn, as the 
shepherds have. Great is the treasure, but small is the 
house in which it lies and dwells. 


V. 14, 15: For I know that I must soon leave my 
tabernacle, as the Lord Christ has also told me. But I 
will be diligent to keep this in remembrance for all of 
you after my departure. 


Here Peter testifies of himself that he was sure of 
eternal life and that God had revealed to him beforehand 
when he was to die. This happened for our sake and for 
the sake of our faith. For there must have been some 
such people who knew for certain that they had been 
chosen, who were to establish the faith, so that it would 
be known that they were not preaching the doctrine of 
men, but the word of God; but before they came to such 
assurance, God had well tried and swept them before. 
So Peter says: "I will not only remind you with a living 
voice, but | will also put these things into writing and 
command you through others, so that you will always 
keep them in mind during my life and after my death, and 
not let them go. See how much concern the apostle had 
for the souls; unfortunately, it has not yet helped. 


V. 16-18. For we have not followed wise fables, when 
we made known to you the power and the future of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, but we have been spectators 
of His majesty, when He received glory and honor 
from God the Father by a voice that came to Him 
from the magnificent glory, saying: This is my 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 


I have fallen. And this voice we heard from heaven, 
when we were with him in the holy mountain. 


Then St. Peter tells a story, described in the Gospel, 
Matth. 17, 1. ff, how Jesus took three of his disciples, 
Peter, Jacob and John, and led them away to a high 
mountain, and was transfigured before them, and his 
face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white 
as light, and Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking 
with him. 5: "This is my beloved Son, in whom | am well 
pleased; obey him." When the disciples heard this, they 
fell on their faces and were greatly afraid; but Jesus 
came to them, touched them, and said, wv. 7-9: "Arise, 
do not be afraid. Then they lifted up their eyes, and saw 
no man, save JEsus alone. And when they were come 
down from the mountain, he commanded them that they 
should tell this vision to no man, till he should rise from 
the dead." So now St. Peter wants to say: "That | preach 
to you about Christ and about his future, the gospel that 
we preach, we did not make up out of our fingers or think 
up ourselves, nor did we take it from the clever fables 
who know how to speak magnificently about all things 
(as the Greeks were at the same time). For these are 
vain fables and fairy tales and useless talk, which they 
pretend to be wise and want to be wise in. We have not 
heard such things, nor have we followed them; that is, 
we do not preach man's words, but we are sure that they 
are from God, and we have seen and heard them with 
our eyes and ears, namely, when we were with Christ on 
the mountain, and saw and heard his glory. The glory 
was that his face shone like the sun, and his raiment was 
white as snow; and we heard a voice from the highest 
Majesty, saying, "This is my beloved Son, whom ye shall 
hear." 

(34) Let every preacher be so sure, and not doubt that 
he has God's word and preaches it, that he may die on 
it, since it is our life. Now no man is so holy that he 
should die on the doctrine which he himself has taught. 
Therefore, it is decided here that the apostles were 
ordained by God. 


1358 en. 52, 29-231. interpretations on the 2nd epistle of St. Peter. w. 1x, 852-855. 


1359 





have known that their gospel was the word of God. And 
here it is also proven that the gospel is nothing else but 
a sermon of Christ. Therefore no other preaching is to 
be heard, for the Father will have no other. "This is my 
beloved Son (saith he), whom ye hear," he is your 
Doctor; as if he should say, If ye hear this, ye have heard 
me. Therefore Peter says, "We have proclaimed and 
made known to you Christ, that he is the Lord, and has 
dominion over all things, and that he has all power; and 
he who believes in him has all such power. These things 
we have not devised ourselves, but have seen and 
heard by the revelation of God, who commanded us to 
hear Christ. 

35 But why does Peter separate the power and the 
future of Christ? The power is, as we have heard above, 
that he is mighty over all things, that all things must be 
at his feet; it will last forever, as long as the world stands; 
because we are flesh and blood, and live on earth, 
Christ's kingdom will continue until the last day; after that 
another time will come, when he will hand over the 
kingdom to God the Father, of which St. Paul says, "The 
firstfruits are Christ; after that those who belong to Christ 
will be his future. Paul 1 Cor. 15, 23. 24. says: "The first 
fruits are Christ; then those who belong to Christ, who 
will be at his future time; then the end, when he will hand 
over the kingdom to God and the Father" 2c. Item, v. 28: 
"But when all things shall be subject unto him, then shall 
the Son himself also be subject unto him that put all 
things under him." 

How, then, is not now the kingdom of God the 
Father? Is not everything subject to Him? Answer: St. 
Paul lays himself out in the same place, and says: "That 
God may be all in all"; that is, what each one will need 
and have, that will be God's; as St. Peter said above [v. 
4] that we are to become "comrades" in the divine 
nature. Therefore, we shall have all that God has, and 
all that we need we shall have in Him, wisdom, 
righteousness, strength and life, which we now believe 
and have in our ears alone, and in the word of God; but 
then the word shall cease, and our soul shall be turned 
away. 





and see and feel everything presently. 

37 This is what St. Paul and Peter mean, that the 
power of Christ's kingdom is going on now, now he leads 
the word, and with it he reigns through his humanity over 
devils, sin, death and all things; but on the last day it will 
be revealed. Therefore, even though God reigns forever, 
it is not revealed to us; He sees us, but we do not see 
Him. Therefore Christ must hand over the kingdom to 
him, so that we may also see it; then we will be Christ's 
brothers and God's children. Thus Christ received glory 
and honor from God (says St. Peter), when the Father 
subjected all things to Him and made Him Lord, and 
glorified Him with this voice, saying: "This is My beloved 
Son, in whom | am well pleased. With this, St. Peter 
wants to confirm his teaching and preaching, so that one 
knows where it comes from. But nothing more happened 
to him than that he heard these things and was able to 
preach them; but the Holy Spirit also had to come and 
strengthen him so that he believed them and preached 
and confessed them joyfully. This belongs to the 
preaching ministry alone, not to the soul; but this 
belongs to the spirit. 


v.19. We have a firm prophetic word, and you do 
well to heed it as a light shining in a dark place until 
the day dawns and the morning star rises in your 
hearts. 


(38) Then St. Peter rightly takes up the matter, and 
will say this much: "Therefore all that | preach is to be 
done, that your conscience may be sure, and your heart 
may stand firm upon it, and not be moved away from it, 
that both | and you may be sure that we have the word 
of God; for it is an earnest dealing with the gospel, that 
it may be taken and kept pure and true, without addition 
or false doctrine. Therefore Peter began to write against 
the doctrine of men. 

039 But why saith he, We have a firm prophetic word? 
Answer: | think we will not have such prophets from now 
on. 


1) "dem" and immediately following "der" are used by us instead 
of: "das" and "die". - Belonging is often construed by Luther with the 
accusative. 


1360 En. 52, 231-233. sermon on 2 Petr. 1, 19-21. 


as the Jews had in the Old Testament. But a prophet is 
supposed to be the one who preaches about Jesus 
Christ. Therefore, although many prophets in the Old 
Testament prophesied of things to come, they actually 
came and were sent by God to proclaim Christ. Now 
those who believe in Christ are all prophets, for they have 
the right headship that prophets should have, even 
though they do not all have the gift of prophecy. For a 
we are brethren, kings, and priests by the faith of the Lor 
Christ, so also by Christ are we all prophets. For we ca 
all tell what belongs to salvation and the glory of God an 
Christian life, and also of things to come, as much as we 
need to know; as that the last day will come, and we wil 
rise from the dead; for this we understand all Scripture! 
Of this also Paul says 1 Cor. 14:31, "Ye can all prophesy, 
one by one." 

040 Peter therefore saith, We have this prophetia 
word, which is fast unto him: only see that it be fast unta 
you: and ye do well to take heed. As if to say, "It will be 
necessary for you to hold fast to it," for the gospel is just 
as if one were imprisoned in a house in the middle of the 
night, when it was pitch dark, and it would be necessary 
to light a lamp until daylight came, so that he could see 
So the gospel is actually in the middle of the night an 
darkness. For all men's reason is vain error an 
blindness; so the world is nothing else but a kingdom o 
darkness. In this darkness God has lit a light, namely the 
gospel, in which we can see and walk as long as we are 
on earth, until the dawn comes and the day dawns. 


41 Therefore this text is also strong against al 
doctrines of men. For since the Word of God is the light 
in a dark and gloomy place, it is decided that everything 
else is gloom. For if there were any other light without the 
word, St. Peter would not say so. 





1) "den" is missing in the Jenaer and in the Erlanger. 


W. IX, 855-857. 1361 


Therefore, do not look at how reasonable people are 
who teach something different, how great they pretend 
to be; where you do not feel God's word, do not doubt 
that it is darkness, and do not let anything challenge you 
that they say they have the Holy Spirit. How can they 
have God's Spirit if they do not have God's Word? 
Therefore they do nothing but call the darkness light, 
and make the light darkness, as Isaiah chap. 5:20 says. 
This is the word of God, the gospel, that through 
Christ we are redeemed from death, sin and hell; 
whoever hears this has the light and lamp kindled in his 
heart, whereby we can see, which enlightens us and 
teaches us what we should know. But where this is not, 
there we go, and want to find the way to heaven by our 
own imaginations and works; of this you can judge by 
your light, and see that it is darkness. Therefore, 
because they do not want to have or accept the light, 
they must remain in darkness and blindness, for the light 
teaches us everything we should know and what is 
necessary for salvation, which the world does not 
recognize through its wisdom and reason. And we must 
have the light and cling to it until the last day. After that, 
we will no longer be allowed to hear the word, just as the 
natural light is extinguished when the day dawns. 


V. 20. 21. And this you should know for the first, 
that no prophecy in the Scripture is done by its own 
interpretation. For no prophecy has ever been 
produced by human will, but the holy people of God 
have spoken, driven by the Holy Spirit. 


Here Peter attacks the false teachers 2). Since you 
know (he says) that we have the word of God, stay on it 
and do not be deceived by other false teachers, even if 
they come and pretend that they also have the Holy 
Spirit. For "this you shall know first (for the other he will 
say afterwards), that no prophecy in the Scriptures is 
done by their own interpretation"; so judge yourselves, 
and think not, 


2) Jenaer and Erlanger: "Lehre".

that you will interpret the Scriptures by your own reason 
and wisdom. 

(44) All the fathers' own interpretations of Scripture’ 
are hereby laid down and struck down, and it is forbidden 
to build upon such interpretations. If Jerome or Augustine 
or any of the fathers have interpreted it themselves, we 
will not. Peter has forbidden, thou shalt not interpret 
thyself; let the Holy Spirit interpret it himself, or let it 
remain uninterpreted. If then one of the holy fathers can 
prove that he has his interpretation from Scripture, which 
proves that it should be interpreted in this way, then it is 
right; if not, then | should not believe him. 

45 Thus Peter attacks even the bravest and best 
teachers; therefore we must be sure that no one is to be 
believed, though he himself interprets and expounds the 
Scriptures. For no right understanding can be made by 
one's own interpretation. Now here all teachers and 
fathers, as many as there are, 1) who have interpreted 
the Scriptures, have stumbled. As when they interpret 
the saying of Christ Matth. 16, 18: "You are Peter, and 
on this rock | will build my church," to the pope, this is a 
human, self-invented interpretation; therefore one should 
not believe them. For they cannot prove from the 
Scriptures that Peter is any of the 


1) Walch and the Erlanger: are. 


Pabst's name. But this we can prove that the rock is 
Christ and the faith, as Paul says. This interpretation is 
right. For of this we are sure that it was not devised by 
men, but drawn from the Word of God. Now the things 
which are written and preached in the prophets (says 
Peter) were not invented or devised by men, but were 
spoken by holy and righteous men out of the Holy Spirit. 

46 This is the first chapter, in which St. Peter first 
taught what righteous good works are, so that we may 
prove our faith. Secondly, that nothing should be 
preached in Christendom but the Word of God alone. 
The reason why this should be so is no other, as we 
have said, but that one must preach such a word as 
endures forever, so that souls may be preserved and 
live forever. Now follows a faithful admonition, which 
Christ, Paul, and all the apostles also gave, to beware 
and beware of false preachers. This is especially 
important for us to understand, so that we do not allow 
ourselves to be carried away by the right and authority 
that all Christians have, to judge and pass judgment on 
all doctrine, and do not let it come to this, that we should 
first wait until the Concilia conclude what we should 
believe, and follow it. Let us now see. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. But there were also false prophets 
among the people, just as there will be 
false teachers among you. 


This is what St. Peter wants to say: All prophecy shall 
proceed from the Holy Spirit until the end of the world, 
as it proceeded from the beginning of the world, that 
nothing shall be preached but the word of God. But it 
has always been so, that beside the righteous prophets 
and God's word there have been false teachers, and will 
remain so. Therefore, since you now have God's word, 
you should take care that you also have false teachers. 





This has been sufficiently warned, and it cannot be 
lacking where God's word is preached righteously, that 
false preachers also rise up alongside it. The reason for 
this is that not everyone grasps the word and believes 
in it, even though it is preached to everyone. Those who 
believe it follow it and keep it; but the majority who do 
not believe take a false understanding of it, so that false 
teachers arise. 

But we, unfortunately, did not pay attention to this 
piece, nor to this warning, 


2) "da" is missing in Walch and in the Erlanger. 


1364 


Erl. 5S, S35-S37. 


Sermon On 2 Petr. 2, 1.

W. IX, 861-864. 





but ran, and what was preached we did; then we burst 
and fell upon it, and went in the delusion, as if the pope 
with his clergy and monks could not err; so they that 
should have prevented such things were the first that did 
it in us. Therefore we are not excused if we believe 
wrongly and follow false teachers; 1) it will not help us 
that we did not know it, since we were warned before. 
For this purpose God has commanded us that each one 
should judge what he or she preaches and give an 
account of it; if we do not, we are lost. Therefore it is for 
the salvation of every man's soul that he may know what 
is the word of God and what are false teachings. 

3 Such warnings against false teachers are now 
much more back and forth in Scripture. St. Paul Apost. 
20, 29. 30, also gives such an admonition after his 
sermon, so that he may bless those of Ephesus and give 
them the last, saying thus: "| know that after my 
departure grievous wolves will come among you, which 
will not spare the flock. Also out of yourselves shall arise 
men, speaking perverse doctrine, to draw the disciples 
after themselves." Christ also proclaims Matth. 24, 23. 
24.: "If anyone shall say unto you, Behold, here is Christ, 
or there, believe it not. For false Christs and false 
prophets shall arise, and shall shew great signs and 
wonders, to deceive into error (where it is possible) even 
the elect." And again Paul 1 Tim. 4, 1. 2.: "The Spirit 
clearly says that in the last times some will depart from 
the faith and follow the false spirits and doctrines of the 
devil, through those who are false teachers of lies" 2c. 
As strong as such admonitions have gone, if we have 
ever been witty, it has not helped; the admonitions have 
been silent, so we have always gone and let ourselves 
be deceived. 

4 Now let us see who they are, the false teachers that 
Peter is talking about here. | mean that God, out of His 
special counsel, has forgiven them. 


1) Thus the Wittenbergers and the Jenaers. Erlanger: "Shears". 





that our teachers should be called doctores, so that one 
can see which ones Peter means; for he uses the word 
here: falsi doctores, false teachers; do not say false 
prophets or false apostles. In order that he may hit the 
high schools, where such people are made, from which 
come all the preachers in the world, so that there is not 
a city under the papacy that has not made such teachers 
in the high schools. For all the world thinks that these 
are the fountains from which should spring to teach the 
people. This is a desperate error, that no more 
abominable thing ever came on earth than from the high 
schools. Therefore Peter says that such will be vain false 
teachers. But what will they do? Follow on: 


The next to introduce perishable cults. 


(5) He calls them "corrupt sects" or orders and 
orders, so that whoever gets into them is already lost. 
These will introduce (he says), not that they should 
preach in such a way that the gospel and the holy 
Scriptures would be false, for that would be completely 
contrary; but will keep and let remain these names, God, 
Christ, faith, church, baptism, sacrament; but will go 
under these names and set up something that is not of 
this kind. Therefore there is a great difference when | 
say: This one preaches against that, or: preaches beside 
it. So if | preach that Christ is the Son of God and a true 
man, and he who believes in him will be saved, this is 
righteous preaching and the true gospel. But if anyone 
preaches that Christ is not the Son of God, nor a true 
man, and that faith does not save, this is a direct 
contradiction. St. Peter does not speak of this (for our 
high schools, priests and monks do not), but of the 
secondary doctrine which they introduce into the true 
doctrine. As when they speak thus: It is true that Christ 
is true God and man, died for our sins, and that no one 
can be saved who does not believe in him; but this 
belongs only to the common state. But we want to 
establish a more perfect, that one vows chastity, poverty 
and obedience, as much as fasting, consecrating 2c.; 
whoever does this, will be saved by 


1366 


Erl. 52' SS7-sss. 


Interpretations on the 2nd epistle of St. Peter. w. Ix, 864-866. 


1367 





Open your mouth to heaven. Wherever such things are 
preached and heard, that there is no better and more 
blessed thing than virginity and obedience, and that 
monks and priests are in a higher and more perfect state 
than the common man, there is no outright contradiction 
of pure Christian doctrine, nor denial of faith and 
baptism, and that Christ is the Beatificator; but 
nevertheless such things are introduced beside them, 
and lead men astray from the right road, so that they 
build on their nature and works, that they think no more 
of Christ than these words: We believe that Christ is the 
Son of God and man, died and rose again, and saved 
the world, 2c. but they do not put their trust in him at all. 
For if they did, they would not remain an hour in their 
being. So they also preached among the laity, saying, 
"You are Christians, but it is not enough, you must also 
do such and such works, build churches, monasteries. 
To endow masses, vigils 2c. Then the common crowd 
came in and thought it was right, so that Christianity is 
divided and divided into such sects that there are almost 
as many of them as there are cities and people. 

(6) And so one should have preached and taught: 
You are already Christians, and just as well as those 
over a hundred miles; you all have One Christ, One 
Baptism, One Faith, One Spirit, One Word, One God; 
therefore no work that can be done helps to make a 
Christian. In this way, the people would be kept in a 
common faith, and there would be no difference before 
God, but one like the other. They have torn apart this 
unity by saying: You are a Christian, but you must do 
works to be saved, and thus lead us from faith to works. 
That is why St. Peter, if one wants to interpret it correctly, 
says nothing else but this: "High schools, doctors, 
priests, and monks will come, and the people all 
together, who will introduce corrupt sects and orders, 
and lead the people astray with false teachings. This is 
exactly what he means, for they all thought that their 
orders would make them blessed, and that they would 
be trusted and relied upon. For where they did not think 
so, they stayed out. 





And will deny the Lord who bought them. 

007 O, they say, we deny the Lord nothing 
everywhere. When they say, If thou be redeemed by 
Christ, and his blood purge thy sin, what wilt thou purge 
with thy nature? they say, Faith alone doth not do it; 
works must also do it. So they confess the Lord Christ 
with their mouths, but with their hearts they deny him 
altogether. 

8 Behold, how well St. Peter speaks: "They deny the 
Lord," he says, "who bought them. They ought to be 
under him, as under a Lord of their own: but though they 
believe that he is a Lord, and hath bought all the world 
with his blood, yet they believe not that they are bought, 
and that he is their Lord, and say, He hath bought and 
redeemed them, but that is not enough; they must atone 
for sin with works, and do enough for it. 

9 Thus we say: If you take away and blot out your sin 
yourself, what has Christ done? You cannot ever make 
two Christs to take away sin. He alone shall and will be 
the one who takes away sin. If this is true, then | cannot 
presume to take away sin myself. But if | do, | cannot 
say nor believe that he takes it away. This then is called 
denying Christ. For though they think Christ is the Lord, 
yet they deny that he bought them. They believe that he 
sits in heaven and is a Lord, but that his real work is to 
take away sin, they take that from him and attribute it to 
their works. So they leave him no more than the name 
and title: over his work, his power and his office they 
want to have themselves. Therefore Christ said rightly, 
Matth. 24, 5: "Many will come under my name, saying | 
am Christ; and will deceive many." For they are actually 
those who do not say, My name is Christ; but: For they 
take to themselves the very office which belongs to 
Christ, and so thrust him from the throne, and set 
themselves thereon. This is seen before the eyes, that 
it is so, that no man can deny it. That is why it is called 


1 368 Erl. SS, S8S-S4S. Sermon on 2 Pet. 2:1-3. 


1369 


W. IX, 866-869. 





St. Peter condemned them, or corrupt sects, for they all 
run straight to hell, so that | think that hardly one in a 
thousand will be preserved. For he that shall be 
preserved therein must say thus, My obedience, my 
chastity 2c. doth not make me blessed, my works take 
away no sin. But how many there are who have this 
opinion, and remain in such a damned state! 


And will bring upon themselves a_ swift 
damnation. 


(10) That is, their condemnation will soon overtake 

them; although it may be seen that God will delay a long 
time, yet he will come soon enough. But it will not 
happen bodily, so that one could see it with the eyes; but 
as the 55th Psalm, v. 24, says: "They will not bring their 
days to the half," that is, death will seize them before 
they know it, so that they will say, as Ezekiel says, Isa. 
38, 10: "I have said, in the means of my life | must go 
down to hell." As if they should say: Lord God, is death 
already here? For those who do not live in faith never 
tire of life; the longer they live, the longer they want to 
live, and the more holy they seem, the more terrible 
death becomes to them, especially to those who have 
tender consciences, and are hostile to works and fearful. 
For it is not possible to overcome death with human 
strength; where there is no faith, the conscience must 
wriggle and despair; where faith is strong, death comes 
too slowly: again, it always comes too soon to the 
unbelievers, for there is no cessation of the desire and 
lust to live. 
11 This is what Peter means here: "These people who 
set up such sects and deny Christ in this way will die with 
great displeasure, trembling and fear, because they 
cannot think otherwise than, 'Who knows whether God 
will be merciful to me and forgive my sin? The longer 
they remain in it, the more terrible death becomes for 
them. For death cannot be overcome before sin and the 
evil conscience. 


Be gone first. So their condemnation will come upon 
them in haste, so that they will have to remain in death 
forever. 


V. 2. and many will follow their destruction. 

(12) Now we see before our eyes that the same thing 
happened as St. Peter proclaimed before. There has not 
been a father or mother who has not wanted a priest, a 
monk or a nun for her child; so one fool has made 
another. For when men have seen the misfortunes and 
miseries of wedlock, and have not known what a blessed 
estate it is, they have sought to help their children that 
they may have good days, and be free from such 
unpleasantness. Therefore Peter did not proclaim 
otherwise than that the world would become full of 
priests, monks and nuns. The youth and the best in the 
Wett ran to the devil in droves, that St. Peter, 
unfortunately, says all too true that many of them would 
follow this ruin. 


Through which the way of the truthful will be 
blasphemed. 


13. This is also a piece that you can see before your 
eyes. To "blasoheme" means to reproach, condemn and 
curse. As when one condemns the Christian state as 
error and heresy. Now when one preaches and says that 
their way is contrary to the gospel, because they lead 
people from faith to works, they go to them and cry out: 
They blaspheme even more, that they turn back what 
Christ said, and say no to it; as, that they make of what 
Christ commanded no more than counsels; item, that 
they forbid what Christ freely willed, and make sin where 
he makes none, condemning and burning him that 
preaches against it. The way of truth is a righteous life 
and walk, where there is neither pretense nor hypocrisy, 
which is the faith in which all Christians walk; which they 
cannot suffer, blasoheming and condemning it, that they 
may exalt and protect their nature and sect. 


V. 3. And through avarice with invented words 
they will skin you. 


(14) This is the manner of all false teachers, that they 
preach of covetousness, that they may make their

Interpretations On the 2nd Epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 869-S7I. 


1371 





As you Can see, no one has ever said a mass or vigil for 
free. No monastery or foundation has ever been built 
that does not pay enough interest. There is no 
monastery in the world that serves the world for God's 
sake. It is all about money. But if one preaches the faith 
righteously, this does not bring much money; for then all 
pilgrimages, letters of indulgence, monasteries and 
convents must fall away, to which one has turned and 
given more than half of all the world's goods, from which 
no one has had any benefit, but only priests and monks. 

(15) But how do they lay hold of money? "With 
invented words (says Peter) they will bargain for you." 
For they have chosen words according to this, that they 
may defraud men of money. As when they say, "If you 
give so many hundred florins to our dear women and to 
this or that saint, you will do a great and excellent work, 
and earn so many indulgences and forgiveness of sins, 
and deliver so many souls from purgatory 2c. These and 
the like are vain, exquisite, fictitious words, so that only 
money is scraped from us. For there is truly no merit, nor 
grace, nor sin blotted out: Nor do they interpret all the 
noble words to make money with them. So also the 
sacrament, which is holy and full of grace, has become 
nothing else but a fair. For they do nothing else with it, 
than that they grease the mouths of the people, and 
scam money from them. Therefore, see if St. Peter has 
not rightly struck and depicted our clergy. 


About whom the verdict of long ago is not tardy, 
and their condemnation does not sleep. 


(16) They will not go on for long, nor will they go out, 
but when they have gone to the top, their judgment and 
condemnation will fall upon them. It is already happening 
now, they will not escape it, as St. Paul also says 2 Tim. 
3, 9: "Their foolishness will be revealed to everyone", so 
that they will be put to shame. May God grant that they 
may be converted and come out of the wicked life when 
they hear and know it. For although there are some who 
have not been deceived in the state of 





But if he is to become a man, he is no more in himself 
than vain corrupt sects: 

Thus St. Peter began to describe the shameful, 
ungodly life that would follow according to the righteous 
teaching of the gospel preached by the apostles. Now 
he continues, and gives us three terrible examples: of 
the angels, of the whole world, and of Sodoma, as God 
has condemned it, and speaks thus: 


v. 4 For if God has not spared the angels who have 
sinned, He has cast them into hell with chains of 
darkness and delivered them up to be judged. 


(18) With these words St. Peter frightens those who 
live boldly and securely, as we see that those who cling 
to that which the pope has set up are so defiant and 
insolent, as if they wanted to trample everyone 
underfoot. Therefore he wants to say: Is it not a great 
presumption of them that they go along so meagerly, 
and want to lead everything out with their heads, as if 
God should leave them and spare them, who 
nevertheless the angel 1) did not spare? As if he were to 
say, "These examples should also reasonably frighten 
the saints when they see such a serious judgment that 
God has not spared the high spirits and noble creatures, 
which are much wiser and wiser than we are, but has 
cast them into the chains of darkness. This is the severe 
judgment and condemnation to which He has decreed 
them, in which they are imprisoned and condemned, so 
that they cannot escape from the hands of God, so that 
they are thrown into the outer darkness, as Christ says 
in the Gospel, Matth. 22, 13. 

19 And here St. Peter also shows that the devils have 
not yet finally had their chastisement, but are therefore 
going on in a hardened, desperate state, and are waiting 
for their judgment every moment; like a man who is 2) 
condemned to death, is completely desperate, 
hardened, and becomes more and more evil; but their 
punishment has not yet passed over them, but they are 
now alone composed and kept for it. This is the first 
example, now follows the other: 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: the angels. 
2) Jenaer and Erlanger: that. 


1372 


Erl. 5S, 244-S46. 


V. 5. and spared not the former world, but 
preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and 
brought the flood upon the world of the wicked. 


(20) This is also a terrible example, and there is none 
more cruel in Scripture; one who is also strong in faith 
should almost despair of it. For when such sayings and 
God's judgment go to a man's heart, and he thinks of 
them when he is to die, he must fidget and tremble, if he 
is not well prepared, that among so many in all the world 
none but the eighth have been kept. What did they do to 
deserve that God should drown the world with such a 
severe judgment, all together in one heap, man and 
woman, master and servant, young and old, beast and 
bird? Because they led such a wicked life. Noah was a 
pious man and a preacher of righteousness, and had lived 
five hundred years before the flood, when God 
commanded him to build a box, and after that he built ita 
hundred years, and always led a righteous godly life. 

(21) You can imagine the cross he had to bear, and 
the worry and fear the pious man had to endure, since he 
had to testify 1) with words and deeds that he was a 
Christian. For it is not fitting that faith should hide itself 
and not break out before the people with preaching and 
good deeds. So this one alone, perhaps a long time 
before God called him to build the box, did not preach the 
ministry and the word of God in one place, but 
undoubtedly through many countries. Therefore he must 
have suffered great and much persecution, that he was 
especially (as Peter says) preserved and kept by God; 
otherwise he would soon have perished and been 
strangled. For with this he had to incur much envy and 
hatred, and make many high, wise and holy people his 
enemy; but it did not help, because the world despised 
God's word and only became more and more evil. 

22) When they had practiced their wickedness for a 
long time, God said Gen. 6:3: "My Spirit will not be a judge 
among the people forever.

Sermon on 2 Petr. 2, 5. 6.

People, because they are flesh. | will give them a 
hundred and twenty years. Item, v. 7: "I will destroy the 
men whom | have created from the earth, from man even 
to the worm" 2c. These words he preached and 
practiced daily, and began to build the box when he was 
commanded, and made over it an hundred years. But 
the people laughed at him and became even more stiff- 
necked and obstinate. As for the sin for which God 
destroyed the world, the text says Genesis 6:2, 4.The 
children of God," that is, those who came from the holy 
fathers and were instructed and raised in the faith and 
the knowledge of God, "saw the daughters of men as 
beautiful, and took them as wives whomsoever they 
pleased; and afterward they became mighty tyrants," 
doing whatever they pleased according to their own will; 
therefore God punished the world and destroyed it with 
the flood. 


V. 6. and made the cities of Sodoma and 
Gomorrah ashes, turned them upside down and 
condemned them, to set an example to those who will 
be ungodly in the future. 


(23) This is the third example of how the five cities 
were destroyed, Genesis 19:24, 25, of which also the 
prophet Ezekiel, Cap. 16:49 ff, says to the city of 
Jerusalem, "This was the sin of Sodom, your sister, in 
that they had hoped, in that they had plenty of bread, in 
that they had abounded, and in that they had not 
reached out to the poor, and had exalted themselves, 
and had wrought this shameful abomination before me, 
wherefore | also destroyed them. For Sodoma was a 
land like a garden of God (as Moses speaks 1 Mos. 13, 
10.), and a lard pit of delicious oil and wine and all things, 
that everyone thought God dwelt there. Therefore they 
were safe and led such a shameful life as Moses 
describes. This sin was not brought on by anyone, but 
by their pride, so that they had enough to eat and drink, 
and plenty, and idleness besides. As we can see, the 
richer the cities, the more shameful the lives they lead; 
but where there is hunger and sorrow, there are also 
fewer sins. Therefore God allows His people to sour their 
food, so that they remain pious.

(24) These are the three terrible examples that St. 
Peter gives to the wicked. Because he now urges this 
upon them, we must take it for granted that it is the same 
here. And this is actually spoken of the spiritual state, 
pope, cardinals, bishops, priests, monks and nuns, and 
all those who are attached to them; who, like the angels, 
were appointed in the place of the apostles to preach 


and proclaim the word of God. For angelus is a 
messenger or skillful one who advertises his message 
orally; therefore the preachers in Scripture are called 


angeli, that is, God's messengers. Such angels should 
be our ministers. But as those angels fell away from God, 
and set themselves above God, and wanted to be their 
own lords, so do these also, and keep no more than the 
name that they are called messengers, as those alone 
are called angels. So now these also, because they have 
fallen away from God, are bound with the devil in bands 
of darkness, and are kept for damnation, as he said 
above [v. 3]: "that their judgment is not delayed, and their 
damnation does not sleep," even though the punishment 
has not yet passed over them. 

(25) Secondly, they are like the former world, which, 
though they heard prophets and the word of God, yet 
blasphemed and profaned it, and as Moses writes, 
Genesis 6:2, 4, took wives as they pleased, and became 
great and mighty tyrants. There see, whether it does not 
go now everything alfo, which Moses writes from those 
1). These are the great Hansen, live in the Sause, 
oppress the world by their tyranny, and may nobody 
reproach them; in addition they may, whom they want, 
his wife and daughters take. In spite of that someone 
complains about it. For if anyone complains about it, they 
themselves are judges, and no one can accuse them. 
After that, what they may devise, what they may bring to 
themselves with treachery and treasure, that they also 
do. And if one wants to attack them, they say: "It is the 
spiritual property of the church; it is free, therefore one 
must not touch it. And those who preach God's word, 
punish them for their lives, and proclaim God's judgment 
over them, ridicule them, do not want to hear it, and 
persecute the same preachers. 


1) Jenaer: "jnen" i.e. them. 


of righteousness, and remain great, mighty lords, 
wanting to keep the name that they are called clergymen, 
like those children of God, and rule with full power 
according to all their might; but they must perish and be 
destroyed at last; but the others, who preach God's word, 
are preserved and kept. 

26. Third, as the land where the cities of Sodoma and 
Gomorrah were was a lard pit, and had all that the earth 
could bear; whereof the people went idle, and did eat and 
drink to their fill, not reaching out to the poor: So it is also 
in our spiritual state; they have everywhere the best land, 
the best castles and cities, and the greatest pensions 
and interest; so they also have enough to eat and drink; 
there is also no idle people on earth, who live without all 
care and work, and feed themselves only on poor 
people's sweat. But what the idleness brjnge, that one 
sees before eyes. The pope forbids them to take wives 
in marriage. If they keep whores with them and have 
children, then they must give money from each child to 
their bishop; with this they want to counsel the thing and 
prevent the sins. 2) The bishop is the one who has to pay 
the money. Here | do not want to say about other secret 
sins, which must not be touched. Summa Summarum, 
here you see that St. Peter considers the spiritual state 
nothing else than Sodoma and Gomorrah. For they are 
all such people, of whom no one can enjoy, who reach 
out to no one, but snatch to themselves everything they 
can, under such pretense that they pretend that what is 
given to them is given to God, and leave no one to be 
helped who is in need. Therefore, as those have turned 
back and become ashes, so must they also be destroyed 
at the last day. 


V. 7: And he redeemed righteous Lot, who was 
deceived by the lewdness of the abominable. 

027 Was it not a great abomination that they 
committed not only fornication and adultery, but such sin 
as is not to be told, openly and brazenly? that they 
spared not even the angels that came to Lot. And this 
they both did. Young and old, in all corners of the

City. Against this, the pious Lot preached daily and 
punished them, but it did not help, but was deafened by 
them, so that he had to stand still and could not counsel 
the evil, as is happening to us now. For now there is no 
hope that the horrible being who leads the world can be 
advised or helped. 


V. 8 For while he dwelt among them justified, that 
he should see and hear, they tormented the righteous 
soul from day to day with their unrighteous works. 


Then Peter describes the cross that the holy man had 
to bear because he preached to the people and raised 
his daughters in the faith, and thus was preserved with 
them by God. Now St. Peter decides how the wicked will 
be kept for punishment until the last day. 


V. 9. 10. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly 
from temptation, but to keep the unrighteous for the 
day of judgment, to torment them, but mostly those 
who walk according to the flesh, in the lust of 
uncleanness. 


This is a great anger and seriousness from the 
apostle. If God has not spared the young and the new 
world, how much more severely and cruelly will He 
punish them now that the gospel has been revealed and 
preached, and no such great light has ever gone out 
before; as Christ also proclaimed in Matt. 11:23, 24: 
"Woe to you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, 
you will be cast down to hell. For if the deeds that were 
done in you had been done in Sodom, they would still be 
there today. But | say unto you, that the land of Sodom 
shall be worse off at the last judgment than thou." But 
such a reproach is of no avail, the wicked do not turn to 
it. 

30 "To walk in the pleasure of uncleanness" is thus 
to live like an unreasonable animal, according to its own 
sense and all pleasure. So it is all set in the pabst's laws, 
as it has pleased him, and has had to serve everything 
to their will and tyranny, and have directed it and 
interpreted it as they desire, and according to that.

said that the Holy See of Rome could not be wrong. 
There is not one who has preached anything about faith 
or love, but have taught nothing without what they 
themselves have devised. 


V. 10. 11. And the rulers despise, scorn, think 
highly of themselves, not trembling to blaspheme the 
majesties; yet the angels, who are greater in strength 
and might, endure not the blasphemous judgment 
against them from the Lord. 


31 He calls kings, princes, lords, and all temporal 
authorities "lords"; not the pope and bishops, for these 
should not be lords, since Christ in the New Testament 
appointed no more than servants, that one Christian 
should serve and honor another. Therefore Peter means 
that they should be submissive and obedient to the 
worldly overlords, so that the sword, which was 
appointed by God's order, would be in fear. So they do 
the opposite, they have pulled themselves out and say 
that they are not subject to the worldly authorities. Yes, 
they have not only pulled themselves out, but have also 
thrown them under themselves and trampled them 
underfoot, and have insolently let themselves be called 
lords, even by kings and princes; as the pope writes of 
himself that he is a lord of heaven and earth, and has 
both spiritual and temporal swords in his hand, so that 
everyone must fall at his feet. 

32) About 2) St. Peter says, "that they also not 
tremble to blaspheme the majesties. For it was a small 
and bad thing for the pope to banish kings and princes, 
to malign them, and to depose them from the throne. 
Item, that he should cause misfortune among them, and 
set the princes on one another, and those who opposed 
him, he soon overpowered and trampled under himself; 
Not because they did anything against faith or love, but 
only because they did not want to be subject to the 
Roman see, nor kiss the feet of the pope, because their 
[the popes'] power was so much greater than that of 
worldly lords, as much as the sun is above the moon, 
and as high as heaven is from earth, as they blasoheme 
and lie.

1) To be subject and obedient to them, and to praise 
them, and to pray for them; as the Lord Christ submitted 
to Pilate, and gave the interest groschen to the emperor. 
They should tremble that they should blaspheme the 
majesties, so they are undaunted and meager for it, and 
blaspheme them with full iniquity and boldness, "if even 
the strongest angels cannot bear the judgment against 
them from the Lord," and yet they are obdurate, 
blaspheming and cursing the same, which they cannot 
escape; how then will these wretched people bear it? 


V. 12. 13. But they are like the unreasoning beasts, 
which are naturally born to see and to strangle, 
blaspheming that they know not, and in their 
strangulation they shall be strangled, and shall bring 
away the reward of iniquity. 


33 St. Peter calls them "unreasonable beasts," 
because they have no taste of the Spirit in them, they 
have no spiritual office that they should have, but live like 
swine and are drowned in the flesh. 

(34) And that he saith, They that are born to see and 
to slay, may be understood in two ways: first, as they that 
see and slay, as there are wolves, lions, bears, 
sparrowhawks, and eagles: that is, they that scrape and 
snatch from men all that they can, both goods and honor; 
and secondly, as they that are seen, slay, and are to be 
slain in the judgment of the last day. 


They respect the temporal well-being for pleasure. 


35 Behold, how angry is St. Peter. | should not 
reproach the young men so cruelly; they think that if they 
only "live well" and have good days, they have enough 
of all things and are quite well off. This can be felt in their 
spiritual right, where they say: whoever touches their 
goods or their bellies is the devil; since they themselves 
cannot deny that their regiment is completely ordered so 
that they have lazy and idle days. 


1) Erlanger: those. 


and have enough of everything, do not want to burden 
themselves with toil or work, but let everyone make 
enough for them, and pretend that they must go to the 
choir and pray. God has commanded all men to eat their 
bread by the sweat of their brow, and has laid on every 
man misfortune and heartache: so these young men 
want to pull their heads out of the noose and sit on the 
cushions. But this is the greatest blindness, that they are 
so obdurate, and think that such a shameful life is right 
and praiseworthy. 


They are stains and unflathe. 


They know no other than that they adorn Christianity 
as the sun and moon adorn the heavens, and are the 
noblest and best jewels, as gold and precious stones; so 
St. Peter calls them stains and blots. The righteous 
Christian life therefore walks in faith, serves everyone 
through love, wears the holy cross, which is the right 
color, adornment, jewel and honor of the Christian 
church; but these have pleasure and well-being for the 
cross; for the love of their neighbor they seek their 
benefit, snatch everything to themselves, and let nothing 
of themselves benefit another; to this end they know 
nothing at all of faith. Therefore they are nothing but 
stains and blemishes, of which Christianity must have 
shame and ridicule. This, | think, is enough to reproach 
our spiritual masters. 


They lead a tender 2) life from your love, well feed 
on yours. 


(37) What was first given out of Christian love, to 
maintain a common chest for widows and orphans and 
other poor people, so that no one among the Christians 
might suffer want or beg, such property has now all gone 
to foundations and monasteries, from which our clergy 
fatten their bellies, live most tenderly, and bring it all 
through with good days, and say that it is their due, and 
that no one should punish them for it. The Holy Spirit 
does not want the church servant to lead a tender life 
from other people's work; for the craftsmen and the 
common man with wife and child are otherwise well 
denied.

1380 Eni. 52, 253-255. sermon on 2 Pet. 2, 14-46. 


V. 14. have eyes full of adultery. 


(38) This must always follow when the body has 
enough to eat and drink and is idle, as said above [§35]. 
But why does St. Peter not say they are adulterers, but 
"they have eyes full of adultery"? So much he wants to 
say: They think only of fornication all the time, and can 
never control fornication, nor become full and weary; 
this makes them always splurge and live well, so that 
they can extend it 1) and that they are allowed to live 
freely and unpunished as they wish; as follows: 


Their sin cannot be resisted. 


39 The pope has forbidden that no prince or secular 
authority should punish the clergy, and where they are 
subject to it, he puts them under ban, but ordered the 
bishops to do the same. But because they are boys 
themselves, they see through their fingers. So they have 
stripped themselves of the secular rule and sword, so 
that no one may resist their will of courage, and they all 
live as they wish, just as they did before the flood. 


Attract to themselves the frivolous souls. 


(40) With such great pretenses, which they put on 
under the evil life, as with masses, prayers, singing, etc., 
they entice and provoke the frivolous and unstable 
souls, who are without faith, that everything wants to 
become spiritual, and everything is brought up to that 
end. For it is thought that in the state everyone has 
enough and good days, and will get to heaven; and yet 
everything is to be done only to fill the belly and our lazy 
sack. 


Have a heart, sly with avarice. 


41 The vice is also so gross and public among the 
clergy that even the common man has complained 
about it. He does not say, however, that they are stingy, 
but rather, "have a heart that is cunning in avarice,” and 
are especially practiced at it. This can be seen in the fact 
that they have invented so many quick and shrewd tricks 
that it is innumerable, so that they bring all the world's 
goods to themselves. Everything that this people 
practices and does is pure avarice, and everything has 
to be 


1) extend - prolong; here as much as continue. 


W. IX, 882-884. 1381 


Money enough. They also prove it in the most honest 
way, how they are skillful and equipped on all sides to 
deprive people of money, so that St. Peter will not 
become a liar. 


They are children of malediction. 


This is said so much in Hebrew: They are cursed 
people, subject to the malediction of God, that they have 
neither happiness nor blessedness before God, and only 
get worse from day to day, and always greater 
blasphemers, so that they may incur God's wrath and 
terrible judgment enough. This is said hard and terrible 
enough; it is high time that whoever can flee and run 
from the cursed state, flee and run. If we are to use such 
a title, it is pitiful. For if the high majesty thus chides, 
curses and condemns, who will bear it? 


V.15. They have left the right way and have gone 
astray. 


(43) They should have taught the right way, how one 
must hold on to Christ through faith and come to God, 
and through love for one's neighbor, and then bear the 
holy cross, and suffer what is repugnant to us because 
of it; so they preach no more, except: Run hither and 
thither, become a 3) monk and priest, endow churches, 
masses 2c., and thus lead people from faith to their 
works, which are of no use to the neighbor. 


V. 15, 16: And they followed the way of Balaam 
the son of Bosor, who loved the reward of iniquity, 
but had a punishment of his transgression, the dumb 
beast of burden speaking with the voice of man, and 
rebuking the prophet's foolishness. 


44 Here he introduces a figure from the fourth book 
of Moses in the 22nd, 23rd and 24th chapters. When the 
children of Israel were come out of Egypt, and were 
entered into the land of Moab, Balak the king sent unto 
a prophet of Syria, whose name was Balaam, and 
besought him to come and curse the people of Judah, 
that they might be weakened, and that he might smite 
them.

would like. Then God came to Balaam and forbade him 
not to curse the people. Therefore, 1) the prophet 
refused to go with them. Then the king sent to him again, 
promising to give him good enough. Then God permitted 
him to go to him, but that he should speak nothing but 
what he would tell him. So he got ready and rode out of 
a donkey, and the angel of God came and stood in the 
way, and stood before him with a bare sword. The 
donkey noticed this and turned aside from the path. Then 
the prophet smote her to go into [the] 2) way. Then the 
angel entered a narrow place in the way, where the ass 
could not turn aside. She pressed herself against the wall 
and rubbed the prophet's foot; then she fell on her knees 
under him. This angered him, so that he became 
enraged and struck the donkey with his staff. Then God 
opened the mouth of the beast, and it spoke with the 
voice of a man, and said, What have | done to thee, that 
thou hast smitten me thus? And he said, Oh, if | had a 
sword in my hand, | would slay thee. And the ass 
answered and said, | am the ass upon which thou hast 
ridden unto this day, and have never done this before. 
Then the prophet's eyes were opened, and he saw the 
angel with the bare sword; and he was afraid, and would 
have been drawn back again. Then the angel 
commanded him to depart; but beside this he 
commanded him that he should speak no other words 
than those which he had spoken unto him. 

045 And when the prophet was come unto the king, 
he brought him up to a high place, whereon he could see 
all the people of Israel. Then the prophet set up seven 
altars, and on each he offered a sacrifice, and went and 
asked the Lord what he should say; and God put the 
words into his mouth. Then he began to bless and praise 
the people of Israel with beautiful words, which he did 
three times in succession. Then the king was wroth, and 
said, If | have not called thee to curse mine enemies, 3) 
now thou hast cursed them thrice.

blesses: | thought to honor thee; but the LORD hath 
refused thee the honor. Balaam answered him and said, 
"If | had told you before that if you gave me your house 
full of silver and gold, | could not speak otherwise than 
what God would tell me. The prophet then gave the king 
advice on how to deal with the people, because he did 
not want to curse them and force them to sin against 
God. Then the king set up an idol called Baal Peor, and 
made the wives of the Moabites, lords and princes' 
daughters, invite the people to sacrifice to their gods, 
and when they brought them, they worshiped the idol, 
ate and drank, and sinned with the wives. Then God was 
angry and put the leaders of the people to death on the 
gallows, killing four and twenty thousand men in one 
day. This was done by Balaam the prophet for the sake 
of money. 

(46) This is what St. Peter is talking about here, and 
he wants to say that our clergy are actually Balaam's 
children and disciples. For just as he gave evil counsel 
to set up an idol, so that the children of Israel were made 
to sin and angered God by being beaten, so our bishops 
have also set up an idol under God's name, namely, their 
human doctrine of their own works, and they forsake the 
faith and snatch Christian souls to themselves, which 
they defile, and thereby arouse God to anger, because 
he has punished the world with blindness and hardening; 
We have all this to thank our spiritual nobles for. Thus 
Peter actually compares these false teachers to the 
prophet Balaam, that they, just like Balaam, only 
establish such idolatry for the sake of money, and 
corrupt souls. 

47 His proper name is also correct. For Balaam in 
Hebrew is called a devourer, as one who opens his 
mouth and devours and eats everything. He bore this 
shameful name because he caused so many people to 
sin that they were strangled and perished. Such 
Balaamites are our bishops and clergymen; they are the 
devil's jaws, so that he may be so 4) un- 


4) Jenaer: so much. 


1 384 Erl. SS, SS7-260. sermon On 2 Petr. 2, 15-18. 


and devours countless souls to itself. The surname of the 
1) prophet is Mus Bosor, which means flesh, or, as 


Moses says, Mus Beor, which means a fool. A fool is his 
father; therefore these are also blind, foolish, and foolish 
people, who themselves need to be governed. Such 
people are carried by the flesh; for the spirit makes other 
people. So God has given them their proper name in the 
Scriptures, and therein he has pictured them, that they 
might be known for what they are. 

Now "the dumb beast of burden," the ass, means the 
people who let themselves be tamed and ridden, and go 
as they are led; as the ass was bruised and severely 
beaten, when it went by the way side in the hollow way, 
and had to go back into the way, until it could never give 
way before the angel, nor step aside, and had to fall 
down. For so the deceivers also drove the people, when 
they felt that it was not to be suffered, and that they led 
wrongly with them, and wanted to step aside. But the 
force was too great, so that they deceived the people 
until God opened our mouths and put the word into our 
mouths, so that even the children would speak of it, so 
that their foolishness would be revealed and they would 
be ashamed. 

(49) This is how they are to be met when they go 
about pretending that it is not proper for the laity to read 
the Scriptures and speak about them, but that they 
should hear what the council decides. Then you may 
answer: Did not God also speak through an ass? Let it 
suffice you that we confess that you have preached the 
word of God in times past. But now that you have 
become fools and possessed by avarice, what wonder is 
it that the common people are now awakened by God 
and begin to speak the truth, having been weighed down 
and oppressed by you like a dumb beast of burden? This 
is the comparison of the prophet Balaam. Now St. Peter 
goes on to say about the false teachers: 


V. 17. These are wells without water, and clouds 
driven by the whirlwind. 

50. as Solomon Proverbs 25, 14. gives a simile and 
says: as if 


1) Erlanger: this. 


1385 


W. IX, 887-889. 


a great cloud and a strong wind comes, and yet no rain 
follows: so is a man who boasts highly, and does not 
keep what he speaks. So Peter also says here, "There 
are fountains without water, and clouds driven about by 
the whirl of the wind"; that is, they pretend to be great 
things, and there is nothing behind them; they are like 
fountains that are dry, distorted, and dried up, though 
they have the glory and title that they are the right 
fountains. For those who teach are called wells in the 
Scriptures, as those from whom the wholesome doctrine 
is to spring, by which the souls are to be refreshed. They 
are smeared and anointed for the ministry, but what do 
they do? Nothing everywhere, there is nothing more than 
the mere name, just as they are called shepherds, yet 
they are wolves. 

51. For this purpose they are "clouds driven by the 
wind", not as the thick, black and dark clouds that are 
used to give rain, but like the light ones in the air, they 
float and fly, 2) and are fine and light, which the wind 
drives wherever it wants, after which nothing can follow: 
So our teachers also float up and soar high in 
Christendom, like clouds in the sky, but are driven where 
the devil wills, to which they are ready for all lusts; but 
preach no word of God at all, like the righteous teachers 
and preachers, who are called clouds in Scripture, as 
Isa. 5, 6. as also by all that gives water, preachers are 
signified in the Scriptures. 


Which is kept a dark gloom for eternity. 
52. they live well now, and do as they please; but 


eternal darkness will come upon them, though they 
neither believe nor feel it. 


V. 18 For they speak of pompous words, since 
there is nothing behind them. 


(53) Do you ask how they can be called fountains 
without water and clouds without rain, when they preach 
to the whole world? Answer St. Peter: They rain and 
preach, alas, all too much, but they are nothing but vain, 
pompous and puffed-up words, so that they blow the 
ears of the poor crowd full, so that

one thinks it is a delicious thing, and yet there is nothing 
behind it; as the monks, with high, brave words, extol 
their obedience, poverty and chastity, so that one thinks 
they are holy people, but it is nothing but vain deceit, and 
neither faith nor love is to be found in it at all. It is also 
the case that they pretend that the episcopal state is a 
perfect state, while they do nothing else but show off and 
ride beautiful stallions, and sometimes consecrate 
churches and altars and baptize bells. The entire 
spiritual right of the pope is full of such pompous and 
pompous words through and through. 


And provoke through lust to the lust of the flesh 
those who had rightly escaped and now walk in error. 


(54) These wells and teachers do this, so that those 
who have barely escaped fall into the snare of the 
wicked, and are caught. A child who has been baptized 
and escaped from all sins, escaped from the devil, and 
placed from Adam into Christ, when he comes to his 
senses, is so soon entangled and led into error. They 
should be taught faith and love and the holy cross: so 
our clergy go to and throw up their works, by which they 
fall back again into error, even if they have escaped. But 
how does this happen? In such a way that through lust 
they excite people to the lust of the flesh. Their highest 
provocation is that they say: priests, monks and nuns 
should not become married; and they bind them to keep 
chastity. In this way they do no more than incite people 
to unchastity, so that wretched people must perish in evil 
pleasures, and they cannot be helped. 

(55) Now here you see clearly that Peter speaks of 
none other than the teachers who rule in Christendom, 
where there are baptized and believing people; for 
among the Turks and the Gentiles no one escapes in this 
way, but among the Christians, where they have room to 
deceive souls and bring them into the snare of the devil. 


V.19. And promise them liberty, if they themselves 
are servants of destruction. For by whomsoever a 
man is overcome, he is his servant. 


(56) They raise up such estates by which one is to be 
saved, as Thomas the preacher-monk impudently wrote: 
If any man enter into an order, that it be as much as if he 
came now out of baptism. There they promise freedom 
and forgiveness of sin by their own works. Such 
blasphemy must be heard, that they equate their human 
dreams and illusionary works, which are without faith, 
with faith and baptism, which God instituted and which 
are actually His work. Who should suffer this and keep 
silent about it? Such sayings were made by the monks 
and spread among the young people, and such teachers 
were made saints, but the other righteous saints were 
burned to powder. 


V. 20. For if they have escaped the uncleanness of 
the wager through the knowledge of the Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ, but are again caught up in it and 
overcome, the latter has become more grievous to 
them than the former. 


(57) Then Peter proves why they are the servants of 
perdition. "To know Christ means to know what he is, 
namely our Savior, who gives us our sin out of pure 
grace. By this knowledge we flee from unrighteousness, 
and come away from the uncleanness of the world. But 
when they have escaped in baptism, they are thrown 
back into it again, so that they again step from faith into 
their own doing. For where there is no faith, there is no 
spirit; but where there is no spirit, there is nothing but 
flesh; so there can be nothing pure. This is how it has 
been in Christianity up to now. Rome at first heard the 
gospel truthfully, but then fell away and fell into the 
doctrine of men, until all abominations arose there. 
Therefore the last has become worse to them than the 
first, that they are now much worse Gentiles than they 
ever were before they heard God's word. 


V. 21, 22: For it were better for them not to know 
the way of righteousness, than to know it, and to turn 
from the holy commandment which is given unto 
them. The true saying has happened to them: The 
dog eats again what he has eaten, 


1388 Erl. SS, 26L-z64. Sermon on 2 Pet. 2, 21. 22. 3, 1-4. 


and the sow rolls in the mud again after the glut. 

58 St. Peter took the proverb from the Book of 
Proverbs, Cap. 26, II, where Solomon says, "A man who 
returns to his foolishness is like a dog that eats again 
what it has eaten. By baptism they have cast out 
unbelief, and have been washed from the unclean 
nature, and have entered into a pure nature of faith and 
love: then they fall again from unbelief and their own 
works, and defile themselves again in filth. Therefore, 
this saying should not be applied to works, for it does 
little good to say after confession, "You shall henceforth 
be chaste, meek, and patient." 2c. Rather, if you want to 
become godly, ask God to give you a righteous faith, and 
then begin to step away from unbelief. When you have 
faith, good works will come to you, so that you will live 
purely and chastely. Otherwise you will not be preserved 
by any other means; and even if you can hide the evil in 
your heart for a while, it will come out at last. 

(59) This is the other chapter of this epistle, in which 
he said before about our teachers, how we would be so 
miserably deceived by them. Though we have been 
warned enough, we 


W. IX, 892-895. 1389 

But we have not heeded it; therefore it is our fault that 
we have not grasped the gospel, and with our nature 
have earned such wrath from God. We all like to hear 
that the pope is attacked and scolded with priests and 
monks, but no one wants to mend his ways. It is not such 
a frivolous game that one may laugh, but such 
seriousness that the heart should be frightened and 
tremble. Therefore we should attack it with seriousness, 
and pray that God will turn away his wrath and such a 
plague from us. For the affliction did not come upon us 
unawares, but was sent upon us by God as a 
punishment, as Paul says in 2 Thess. 2:10, Il: "Because 
they have not received the love of the truth, that they 
might be saved, therefore God will send them strong 
error, that they may believe the lie" 2c. For if the 
punishment had only gone so far that only the false 
teachers were lost, it would still be small compared to 
the fact that they had the rule and led all the world with 
them to hell. Therefore, there is no remedy for the evil, 
except to attack the matter with God's fear and humility, 
to confess our guilt, and to call upon God to take away 
the punishment from us. With prayer one must storm 
against the false teachers, otherwise the devil will not let 
him win. Now continue: 


The third chapter. 


This is the other epistle that I write to you, 
beloved, in which I awaken and remind you to 
remember the words that were spoken to you before 
by the holy prophets and our commandment that we 
find apostles of the Lord and Savior. 

Here St. Peter comes to us again and warns us in this 
chapter that we should be prepared and wait for the last 
day at any moment; and says first of all 1) that he wrote 
this epistle, not to lay the foundation of faith, which he 
did before, but to awaken them, to remind them, to have 
them, and to drive them to it. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: from first. 


Do not forget them, and remain in the true sense and 
understanding that they have of a righteous Christian 
life. For the office of the preacher, as we have often said, 
is not only to teach, but also always to exhort and 
admonish. For since our flesh and blood always cling to 
us, God's word must be steadfast in us, so that we do 
not leave room for the flesh, but fight and resist it. 


V. 3. 4. And know this first, that in the last days 
there shall come scoffers, walking after their own 
lusts, saying, Where is the promise of his future? For 
after the fathers have fallen asleep, all things remain 
as they were from the beginning of the creatures.

1391 





(2) They are still going back and forth with a book 
about the end of Christ, in which it is written that before 
the last day people will fall into such error that they will 
say there is no God, and they will mock everything that is 
preached about Christ and the last day. This is true, 
wherever it is taken from. But it is not to be understood 
that the whole world will say and hold such things, but the 
several parts. For it is already present, and will become 
even more prevalent when the gospel will come to the 
people in a big way; then the people will be stirred up 
finely, and many hearts will "break out" in a big way, 
which are now hidden and not revealed. There have also 
been many of them who did not think anything of the fact 
that the last day is to come. St. Peter warns against such 
scoffers here, and announces to us beforehand that they 
will come, and even strike themselves into the 
entrenchment, and live as they please. In Rome and in 
the Netherlands, this saying has long since been fulfilled, 
and those who come out also bring out such delusions. 
Therefore, as they have long done inside, 1) so must the 
people do outside. 

3 For this very purpose, when the last day is now at 
the door, such people must come forth, that it may be 
fulfilled which Christ saith Matt. 24:37-39: "As it was in 
the days of Noah, so shall also the future of the Son of 
man be. For as they were in the days before the flood, 
they did eat, they drank, they freed themselves, and were 
freed, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and 
they knew it not, until the flood came, and took them all 
away. So shall also the future of the Son of man be." Item 
v. 44: "The Son of Man will come at an hour when you do 
not think. Item Luc. 21, 35: "That day will come as a snare 
upon all who dwell on the earth." And again Luc. 17, 24: 
"As the lightning flashes from heaven above, and shines 
upon all that is under heaven; so shall the Son of man be 
in his day." That is, so swiftly and unawares and suddenly 
he will break in, when the world will live in all certainty 
and throw God's word to the wind. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: therein. 


4 Therefore this will be the sign of the last day, when 
it is near, when people live as they please, according to 
all their lusts, and such talk goes among them, "Where is 
the promise of his future?" The world has stood so long, 
and always remained, should it only now become 
different? So Peter warns us not to fret, and have a sure 
sign that the day will soon come. Follow on: 


V. 5. 6. But willingly they do not want to know that 
the heavens were also before times, and the earth of 
water, and consisted in water by the word of God; 
nevertheless, at that time the world was destroyed by 
these 2) with the flood of sin. 


(5) Such are they, saith he, that do not diligently read 
the scriptures, but wilfully think not, and know that it was 
so in time past. When Noah built the box, the world was 
destroyed by water, which existed and was made by and 
in the water, and the people were so sure and certain 
that they thought there was no need; nevertheless they 
were all destroyed by the water. As if he were to say, "If 
God then destroyed the world with water, and proved by 
an example that he can sink it, rather he will do it now, 
because he has promised it. 

But here St. Peter speaks a little sharply of the 
creation. The heavens and the earth also stood firm in 
time past, were made of water, and existed in water by 
the word of God. Heaven and earth have a beginning, 
have not been eternal; heaven was made of water, and 
was water above and below. But the earth was made of 
water and existed in water as Moses describes, which 
St. Peter touches here. All this is preserved by the Word 
of God, as it is also made by it, for it is not their nature to 
exist in this way. Therefore, if God did not uphold it, it 
would soon all fall apart and perish in the water. For God 
has spoken a mighty word, when He says Genesis 1:9: 
"Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together 
into one place, and let the waters be gathered into 
another place. 


2) Luther's marginal gloss: "word and water". The editions offer: 
"the same". 


1392 


Erl. SS, 266-S68. 


Sermon on 2 Pet. 3, 5-10. 


1393 


W. IX, 898-SOI. 





The water is put aside, and gives room for the earth to 
come forth, on which one may dwell; otherwise, by 
nature, the water would float over the earth. Therefore, 
this is one of the greatest miraculous signs that God still 
performs today. 

Therefore, St. Peter will say: "The scoffers are so 
stubborn and obstinate that they do not want to honor 
the Holy Spirit by reading how God preserves the earth 
in the water, so that they would realize that it is all in 
God's hand. Therefore, because God drowned the earth 
that time, He will do it to us 1) as well. For that example 
should ever move us, because he did not lie there, that 
he will not lie now either. 


V. 7. But the heavens which are yet, and the earth, 
are preserved by his word, to be kept in the fire in 
the day of judgment and condemnation of ungodly 
men. 


(8) In the days when God destroyed the world with 
the flood, the waters came down from above, and went 
up from beneath, and closed in on every side, so that 
nothing could be seen but water, and the earth, as its 
nature was, had to be drowned in water; but now he has 
promised, and given as a sign the rainbow in the sky, 
that he will no longer destroy the world with water. 
Therefore he will consume it by fire and make it dissolve, 
so that there will be fire just as there was water. St. Paul 
also says in 2 Thess. 1, 7. 8: "When the Lord Jesus is 
revealed from heaven with the angels of his power and 
with flaming fire" 2c. Item, 1 Cor. 3, 13.: "Every man's 
work shall be made manifest, the day of the LORD shall 
make ek clear, which shall be opened with fire." So, 
when the last day comes and bursts in, in a moment all 
that is in heaven and earth will become powder and 
ashes, and must be changed by fire, just as it was 
changed by water. 2c. This shall be the sign that God 
will not lie, because he has made that a sign. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: still also. 
2) "alleding" - absolutely. Cf. Walch, St. Louis edition, XVIII, 1331. 





V. 8-10. But one thing be not withheld from you, 
beloved, that one day in the sight of the Lord is as a 
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The 
LORD does not waste the promise, as some do the 
delay, but is longsuffering toward you, and wills that 
no man perish, but that every man repent. But the 
day of the LORD will come as a thief in the night, in 
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great 
noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, 
and the earth and the works that are therein shall be 
burned up. 


(9) With these words, St. Peter meets those of whom 
he has now said, who are speaking: The apostles said 
many things, that the last day would soon come, and 
now so long atime has passed, and yet all things stand 
as before. And hath taken this saying out of Moses, 
Psalm 90:4, saying, A thousand years are before thine 
eyes, as the day that passed yesterday." So this goes: 
There are two reputations: one before God, the other 
before the world. So also this life and that life 3) are two; 
this life cannot be that life, since no one can come to that 
life except through death, that is, through the cessation 
of this life. Now this life is eating, drinking, sleeping, 
sleeping, begetting children 2c., there it goes everything 
after the number, hours, day and year after each other. 
If you now want to look at that life, you must put the 
course of the present life out of your mind altogether, 
must not think that you can thus count it; there it will all 
be one day. One hour, one moment. 

(10) Since there is no reckoning of time in the sight of 
God, a thousand years must be before Him as if it were 
one day. Therefore, the first man, Adam, is as near to 
Him as the last who will be born before the last day. For 
God does not see time by length, but by distance. As 
when you look across a long tree that lies before you, 
you can grasp both places 4) and corners in your face at 
the same time. You cannot do that if you look at it 
lengthwise. Through our reason, we cannot look at time 
in any other way than by its length, 


3) "Life" is missing in the Jena. 
4) Place -end. 


1394 Erl. SS, $68-27I. Interpretations on the 2nd epistle of St. Peter. W. IX, 901-904. 


1395 





must begin to count from Adam, one year after another, 
until the last day. But before God it is all in one heap; 
what is long before us is short before Him, and again. 
For there is no measure nor number. So now the man 
dies, the body is buried and decays, lies in the earth, and 
knows nothing. But when the first man gets up on the last 
day, he will think that he has hardly lain there one hour. 
Then he will look around and realize that so many people 
were born from him and came after him, of which he 
knew nothing. 

11 Therefore St. Peter says: "The Lord does not spoil 
the promise, as some scoffers think, but is patient; 
therefore be prepared for the last day, for it will come 
soon enough after each one's death, so that he will say: 
Behold, | have died but now. But it comes too quickly for 
the world, when people say that there is peace, there is 
no need, it will break and fall upon them, as St. Paul says 
1 Thess. 5, 3. And in such a great crash the day will 
break and burst, like a great thunderstorm, that 
everything must be consumed in an instant. 


V. 11. 12. If all these things are to pass away, how 
then shall ye be skillful in holy walk and godly 
conduct, waiting and hastening to the future of the 
day of the LORD. 


(12) Knowing that all things must pass away, both 
heaven and earth, think how ready you must be with holy 
and godly lives and beings to meet that day. So Peter 
describes this day as coming already now, that they 
should be ready for it, hope for it with joy, and also hurry 
to meet it, as the one who redeems us from sin, death 
and hell. 


V.13. In which the heavens will be dissolved by 
fire, and the elements will be melted by heat. But new 
heavens and a new earth, according to his promise, 
we await, in which righteousness dwells. 


God promised through the prophets that He would 
create new heavens and earth; as Isa. 65:17: Behold, | 
will create new heavens and earth. 





Create a new heaven and a new earth, wherein ye shall 
rejoice, shout, and leap. Item, Cap. 30, 26: "The light of 
the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the 
brightness of the sun shall be seven times as bright," as 
if seven days were joined together. And Christ says 
Matth. 13, 43: "The righteous will shine like the sun in 
their Father's kingdom." How this will happen, we cannot 
know, unless it is promised that such heaven and earth 
shall be, wherein shall dwell no sin, but righteousness, 
and the children of God, as St. Paul says in Romans 8, 
"There shall be love, joy and gladness, and nothing but 
the kingdom of God. 

14 Here one may wonder whether the blessed will 
dwell in heaven or on earth. The text here sounds that 
they will dwell on earth, that is, that all of heaven and 
earth will be a new paradise in which God dwells. For 
God does not dwell in heaven alone, but in all places; 
therefore the elect will also be where He is. 


v. 14. Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting, 
be diligent that you may be found undefiled before 


him and blameless in peace. 


(15) Because ye have escaped such calamities (he 
says), and come to such great joys, ye shall be moved 
to despise willingly all things that are on earth, and to 
suffer gladly those things which ye ought; wherefore ye 
shall take care that ye live blamelessly and 
irreproachably. 

v. 15. And the longsuffering of our Lord Jesus 
Christ is respected for your salvation. 


16 So that he spares and consumes and does not 
judge soon, consider that your gain. He would have 
cause to be angry and to punish, but he does not do so 
out of mercy. 

v. 16. As our dear brother Paul also wrote 
according to the wisdom given him, as he also speaks 
of it in all the epistles, in which some things are 
difficult to understand, which confuse the unlearned 
and reckless, as well as the other writings, to their 
own condemnation. 


17 Then St. Peter gives testimony of his teaching to 
the apostle Paul, which is sufficient. 


1396 En:ss, 271. Sermon on 2 Petr. 3, 16-18. 


w. ix, got. 1397 





indicates that this epistle was written long after St. Paul's 
epistles. 1) And this is one of the sayings that might 
cause someone to think that this epistle is not St. 
Peter's, as there was one before in this chapter, saying, 
v. 9: The Lord does not want anyone to be lost, but that 
everyone should repent. For he goes down a little under 
the apostolic spirit. But it is believable that it is no less of 
the apostle. For since he writes here not of faith but of 
love, he also lets himself down, as is the way of love, 
that it goes under itself toward the neighbor, as faith 
goes over itself. 

18 But he saw that many reckless spirits confused 
and perverted St. Paul's words and teaching, so that 
some things in his epistles are difficult to understand. For 
example, when he says Rom. 3, 28, that no one is 
justified by works, but only by faith. Item, Gal. 3, 19: The 
law was given to make sin greater. Rom. 5:20: Where 
sin abounds, grace abounds still more, and more such 
sayings. For if they 


1) The following section up to the end of this paragraph has been 
omitted in the Wittenberg edition. The reason for this omission will be 
ine concern Luther expresses regarding the apostolic writing of the 
etter. 


When they hear this, they say: If this be true, let us go 
idle, and do no good work, and so become godly. As 
they say now, we forbid good works. For if St. Paul's 
words were perverted, what wonder that ours also 
should be perverted? 


But ye, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, 
take heed lest ye be deceived with them through the 
error of the wicked, and escape out of your own 
stronghold. But grow in the grace and knowledge of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; to Him be praise 
now and forever, amen. 


(19) Knowing, saith he, all things that are spoken 
above, and seeing that many false teachers must come, 
which deceive the world, and such scoffers as pervert 
the scriptures, and will not understand them; take heed 
to yourselves, be diligentlyware of them, lest ye fall from 
the faith through erroneous doctrine, and grow stronger 
day by day in the continual exercise and preaching of 
the word of God. See how much the apostle cares for 
those who have believed, which also drove him to write 
the two epistles, in which everything is abundantly 
written that a Christian should know, as well as what is 
to come. May God grant us His grace to grasp and retain 
it, amen.

The first epistle of St. John interpreted. *) 


Laid out in lectures from August to October 1527. 
Translated from the Latin by M. Johann Jakob Greif. 


Preface. 


1. This is an excellent epistle, as it can uplift the 
sorrowful hearts, and is written according to the ordinary 
spelling of John, thus portraying Christ to us beautifully 
and sweetly. 

The opportunity to write this was given because at the 
same time heretics and sleepy people had gained the 
upper hand in Christianity; which always happens when 
the word of God has been brought back on track, since 
the devil strives without ceasing, and seeks in all ways 
and means to overthrow us, so that we should let go of 
the preached word and good works. In John's time, the 
Cerinthians stood up and denied the divinity of Christ, 
and there were lazy Christians who thought that it was 
enough to hear Christ's word, and that it was not 


Against both evils the apostle acts here and urges us to 
keep the word and to love one another. 

(3) Thus we shall never cease to learn, or become so 
perfect, that the necessity of the divine word shall not 
remain; for the devil is always at work. So the use of the 
divine word, the encouragement of the same, the 
training in the same is always necessary. It is a living 
and powerful word, but we snore and are lazy. It is a 
word of life, but we are daily in death. And because we 
are never without sin and danger of death, we should 
never cease from the ruminations of the Word. And so 
this epistle is written in exhortation. In sum, the apostle 
wants to teach in this epistle faith against heretics and 
true love against the vicious. 


necessary to leave the world and do good to one's 
neighbor. 








*) As Mathesius (Luther's Life, St. Louis Edition, p. 100) reports, Luther read during the plague in 1527, when the university had been 
moved to Jena for the sake of the prevailing illness, "for the students who stayed with him, the first) Epistle of John, which," he says, "M. 
Georg Rérer subsequently gave me to copy. He erroneously reports "in the 28th year", because already around New Year's Day 1528 the 
university was moved from Jena back to Wittenberg. These readings have been preserved in records of listeners in two editions. One was 
published in Leipzig in 1708 under the title: D. Martini Lutheri commentarius in S. Joannis, evangelistae et apostoli, epistolam catholicam, a 
Jacobo Praeposito, theologiae Licentiato et ecclesiae Bremensis antistite, quondam exceptus et primum nunc editus ex bibliotheca 
Vitenbergensi cum aliquot D. Lutheri ad eundem epistolis et praefatione, edited by D. Johann Georg Neumann. The assumption, which the 
editor expresses on the title, that Jacob Probst copied the lectures (Walch adds: "vermuthlich gegen das Jahr 1524"), is, as Késtlin (Martin 
Luther, 3rd ed., vol. Il, p. 648 aa p. 157) correctly remarks, "impossible"; for Probst stayed in Wittenberg only from about the second half of 
the year 1522 to May 1524. Already on May 11, 1524, he had an appointment as pastor to the second church in Bremen. (De Wette, vol. Il, 
p. 511.) It should be noted in passing that he is not also called "Sprenger," as Walch calls him in the introduction to the 9th volume, p. 19; nor 
is he called "Spreng," which De Wette, vol. Il, p. 207, offers in the text and note; but "from Apern," Iperensis (cf. De Wette, vol. Il, p. 511), has 
been read into "Spreng." But the interpretation contains (Késtlin |. 6.) "multiple relations to the Peasants' War, Zwingli, Sacramentirer 2c." 
which point to a later time. "Therefore, they cannot have been copied by him, but only copied by him from another's postscript." Yes, Luther's 
own words in § 45 of the second chapter: "as we have heard enough in Ecclesiastes of Solomon," also give us a clue for the closer 
determination of the time. From these words it is clear that the lectures on Ecclesiastes Solomon were finished. However, Luther "finished 
them in November of 1526" (Késtlin, Martin Luther [8rd ed., vol. 2, p. 156). - The other redaction was published in 1797 by Bruns under the 
title: M. Imttieri Lcdolia 6t 8orlnon.es in I. low. epistolain etc. "Both rewriters (says Késtlin I. e.) have not kept to the letter, and indeed the one 
of Bruns' text has proceeded even more freely than the other." The former, better redaction has M. I. |. Greif translated it for the Leipzig edition 
(Vol. XI, p. 572), and Walch printed this translation. We reproduce the same.

The first chapter. 


V. 1. that was there from the beginning. 


(1) Behold how plainly the apostle speaks. 
Something is left out, and must therefore be added: We 
preach to you the word of life, which was from the 
beginning, otherwise it is a purely childish speech. The 
apostle slurs more than he speaks, and yet in this is the 
most majestic thing, but expressed in the most simple 
words. We want to hear the sound of the Spirit, who 
wants to proclaim the word of life; not the one that was 
born recently, but "the one that was from the beginning". 
Hereby, then, he strikes down the Cerinthum who denied 
the divine nature of Christ. | speak, he says, of Christ; 
not who took his beginning from Mary, but "who was 
from the beginning"; the word of life, which is eternal, is 
spoken of. This word has taken flesh. 


That we have heard. 


He says that he was true man and God. The 
Godhead could neither be heard nor seen; therefore, he 
was true man. 


That we have seen with our eyes, that we have 
looked upon. 


(3) He heaps up the words, making the matter great 
and important. We have examined and considered it 
diligently and carefully; we have not been deceived, but 
are sure that it was not a deception. He says this 
because he wants to make his listeners certain of the 
matter. Peter also speaks in the same way, 2 Ep. I, 16- 
18: "We did not follow clever fables when we told you 
about the power and future of our Lord Jesus Christ, but 
we saw His glory for ourselves, when He received glory 
and honor from God the Father through a voice that 
came to Him from the great glory, like this: This is my 
beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased. And this voice 
we have heard brought down from heaven, when we 
were with him in the holy mountain." 





And have palpated our hands. 


4 Do not doubt our speech. The heretics begin to 
argue about the communication of the divine attributes, 
how each nature must be given its own attributes; thus 
they fall into new errors. Be careful; get used to speak of 
the Lord Jesus in the way the Scriptures speak of him, 
refrain from inventing new words. Joh. 14, 9. Christ says: 
"Philip, whoever sees me, sees also my Father." Philip 
imagined the Father after the humanity of Christ. These 
fluttering thoughts could have easily separated him from 
Christ. But Christ draws him away from these fluttering 
thoughts when he says, "So long am | with you, and you 
do not know me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the 
Father." We believe JEsus Christ to be One Person, yet 
consisting of two natures. Now what is said of the fine 
person is said of the whole person. But that the 
enthusiasts say that Christ suffered according to 
humanity, this is false. The Scripture says that these two 
natures are in One Person; indeed, the Scripture says 
that the Jews crucified the Son of God, not mankind, 
Rom. 8, 3. Likewise 1 Cor. 2, 7. 8.: "If the rulers of this 
world had known the secret, hidden wisdom of God, they 
would not have crucified (he does not speak of mankind, 
but) the Lord of glory." So also Luc. 1, 35. "The holy thing 
that is born of thee shall be called the Son of GOD"; he 
does not speak, mankind, because of the unity of the 
person. What is attached to one nature is also attached 
to the other, yes, it refers to the whole person. Christ 
Himself, the Son of God Himself, is given for us. If 
eternal life was to be given, an eternal and inestimable 
ransom had to be given, as it says in Rom. 8:32: "God 
did not spare His only begotten Son, but gave Him up 
for us all; how shall He not with Him give us all things?"

not sin, and put terror and fear in the hearts of men. He

boasts of the power of death; likewise, that this one falls 


into sin, that one into blasphemy, because he abandons 
faith, hope 2c. On the other hand, it behooves a 
Christian to always stand in the fear of the Lord, to 
always pray that God will protect him and surround those 
who fear him. The devil encamps around them with his 
army, as Peter, 1 Ep. 5, 8, says: "The devil goes about 
like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour." When 
God withdraws His hand, we immediately fall into all 
misfortune. In short, Christ has more weapons of 
righteousness than Satan has weapons. of 
unrighteousness; Christ has more life than the devil has 
death. 


Which was with the Father, and appeared to us. 


11. which was hidden in the Father in heaven before 
the world was created. This we preach to you quite 
boldly, you may only (certainly) believe it. But that we 
preach it so boldly and with all joy, it is because we are 
all too certain of it. 


V. 3: What we have seen and heard we proclaim 
to you. 


Hereby he repeats what he said above [v. 1]. We 
have not chosen such idiosyncratic religions, which 
have been brought forth by human will, and which their 
originators themselves have neither seen nor heard. 
Therefore, such religions must be abandoned and 
trampled underfoot. What will the devil, the author of 
death, ask about your dirty cap, about your impure 
virginity? He also had virgins (who served him) under 
the Roman Empire. For the devil has the wrath of God 
for himself, against you, for he knows that all sins 
displease God. He puts fear in our hearts and frightens 
us. Certainly, one must confront him and argue with 
other things than with such foolish sects and religions of 
ours in the papacy. God protects us in Christ against 
Satan because we are weak instruments. "We do not 
have to fight with flesh and blood, but with princes and 
mighty men", Eph. 6, 12. 





That you may also have fellowship with us. 


(13) | would gladly share this great treasure with you, 
but | cannot do it in any other way than through the Word. 
Only the chosen witnesses have seen and known it. 
Therefore, even if you cannot see and hear it as we do, 
believe; and with it my treasure will be shown to you. 


And let our fellowship be with the Father and with 
His Son, JEsu Christo. 


(14) This is a priceless love; certainly a great 
fellowship and company. But we are no better than you 
for this, even though we have seen him; and you are no 
less for this, even though you have not seen him, if only 
you believe. Thus Peter says, 2 Ep. 1, 4, "that we may 
be made partakers of the divine nature," because we 
have all the goods that God has. What wretched people 
we are, that we do not respect these so holy things, and 
seek other sects and mediators. Through the word that 
is preached to us, we have fellowship with Christ. He 
calls the Son specifically, because he writes in the 
epistle that the Father and the Son have life, truth and 
eternal blessedness. On our side are all sins. We have 
fellowship with his goods, he has fellowship with our 
misery. | believe in Christ; therefore my sin is in Christ. 


V.4 And these things we write unto you, that your 
joy may be full. 


In this way, we are doing you a favor. Your joy has 
begun over this realization. You are rejoicing over a 
priceless good. Who should not rejoice that God is 
reconciled? Who should not rejoice over the communion 
with God? 


Vv. 5 And this is the proclamation which we have 
heard from him and proclaim to you. 


16 Here we see that the holy man repeats and 
inculcates the same thing very much. But for this reason 
he insists on these words: "We testify", "we proclaim to 
you", so that he may make us, who are slippery, certain 
in the word and thereby be resounding. For the holy man 
sees our wretched condition, and the devil's cunning, 


that we are indeed in it. 


1406 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 917-920. 


1407 





that he should repeat the words. Therefore this is a new 
repetition: "And this is the proclamation which we have 
heard from him, and proclaim unto you." He commanded 
that we should proclaim it, that no one might doubt the 
thing itself, because the thing which is proclaimed is 
great and important. 


That GOD is a light. 


17 Meanwhile John says: "The light came into the 
world, and men loved darkness rather than light," John 
3:19, and thus opposes the light of the world, because all 
men, even the saints and the rulers, are decided under 
the general darkness. Therefore John says: "We 
proclaim to you the light which we have heard, and if we 
did not proclaim it to you, you would not have it. 

The monks and wise men of this world, who walk in 
their ways, walk in darkness. Aristotle makes this 
conclusion: If God should see everything that is going on 
here, he would never be calm in his mind; consequently, 
he does not pay attention to our being. But the more 
subtle people are, the less they think of God. The monks, 
wanting to follow reason, have chosen their own 
righteousness, and want to be transformed into a better 
being by their own works. The wiser, the more foolish. A 
simple layman, when he wants to die, has the Crucifix 
brought to him, remembers Christ, and prays, and has 
better thoughts than those. Everything that people invent 
themselves in the work of salvation turns out badly. 


GOd is a light. 


What is not Christ is not light. As often as | hear from 
Fathers, from Augustino, Hieronymo, from Conciliis, | 
ask: Is it also a proclamation? And it is not. So | say: Troll 
yourself. 


God a light. 


20 If the world and the flesh cannot grasp this, let us not 
be deceived. We know that the Son of God took on flesh 
and was crucified for us. The flesh scorns this, and the 
world regards it as nothing. In sum, the whole world shall 





recognize that it is in darkness, and shall be converted 
to this sermon, and recognize this light. 
And there is no darkness in him. 


21 We preach this light. Although no one sees the 
light, it is proclaimed through the word. If we believe it, 
we will surely come to the same light. The followers of 
Cerinthi want to tear apart this light. 

(22) It must be diligently noted from whence heresies 
spring, namely, from one's own reason, when the flesh 
begins to think to itself: This or that pleases me well, and 
seems good to me, therefore it will also please God. The 
fathers have said it, therefore it is true. If you want to 
please God, hear His word and believe in His Son who 
died for you. This is not my reason, | do not invent this 
appearance, but God Himself is the light. They want to 


smear tenebras (darknesses) on our Lord GOtt. They 
smear God on the cap, and stick the divine truth on the 
lies. This is putting darkness into the light. But there is 
no darkness in him, not even the slightest. 


V. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him. 


(23) He goes swiftly to the enthusiasts of his time. We 
see that they are far bolder than the true Christians, and 
boast as if they are assured of their fellowship with God, 
not realizing their weakness. Christians speak of their 
faith and holy fellowship with fear and trembling, and 
desire to increase in it. Christians say: Lord help, Lord 
help. Paul says: "| do not yet count myself worthy that | 
have grasped it," Phil. 3, 13. Let us all, says John, 
remain in this light and say: This is the true light, but we 
do not yet recognize it. Oh, that we would recognize it 
more perfectly! 


And if we walk in darkness, we lie, and 
do not do the truth. 


(24) If we do not continue in the preaching, the word 
is not in us, but lies and deceitful thoughts. The heretics 
walk in darkness, saying there is light. 


1408 


Interpretation on 1 John 1:6-8. 


W. ix, 920-923. 1409 





These are two evils: to err and to defend error. They do} 
many things, but they taste of lies: they lie about faith, 
and do not do the truth about works. Above all, one must 
see to it that the heart has this light, and then the works 
will also follow. But if the light is impure, that is, if faith is 
mixed with the doctrines of men, we do many works, but 
in vain, because they are not light. But Christ is our light. 
The angels see this light, but we hear it. 


V. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, 
we have fellowship one with another. And the blood o 
JEsu Christ, his Son, makes us clean from all sin. 


(25) It is to be wondered at that we preach every year} 
of the blood of Christ and His suffering, and yet see so 
many sects break out. O great darkness of the former 
times! But we, if we remain in the preached word, have 
this treasure, which is Christ's blood. If we are challenged 
by sins, it does us no harm. Christ's blood was not shed 
for the devil or for the angels, but for sinners. Now if | feel 
sin, why should | despair? why should | not believe that it 
is forgiven? because Christ's blood washes away sins. 
This is what the whole thing comes down to, that we cling 
firmly to the word, so there is no need. 

(26) The apostles are diligent that we should keep the 
word diligently and sincerely. If we abide in the light, we} 
know what sin is; if we know, we have the blood of Christ, 
with which we are washed. The devil challenges nothing 
so fiercely, and deals with 1) nothing so much, as to 
snatch this light from us. Therefore we must take care of 
nothing more than that we may remain in it. 


V. 8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, 
and the truth is not in us. 


This is a sweet and comforting word. Augustine noted 
that there is something an- 


1) "with" put by us instead of: on. 





The other is "to have sin" and the other is "to sin". And | 
like this opinion, since Paul ascribes indwelling sin to the 
justified, as Rom. 7, 17: "Therefore | do not do the same 
(evil), but the sin that dwells in me," and Hebr. 12, 1: "Sin 
always clings to us and makes us sluggish. For even 
though we have become a new creature, the remnants 
of sin always remain in us. We have sin, and the poison 
is still in us; and this sin tempts us to the fruits of sin. Just 
as we see in David, to whom the clinging, adhering and 
indwelling sin said: Kill Uriam. And since he consented 
to the same, he sinned. Peter was also provoked in this 
way, since he, after receiving the spirit of the gospel, 
forced the Gentiles to live Jewishly, about which sin Paul 
and Barnabas were indignant, Gal. 2, 11. ff. And we, who 
are not like the apostles in any way, even though we are 
Christians and sprinkled with the blood of Christ, often 
err. 

28 Therefore, the true knowledge of Christ causes 
man to feel and sense that he has sin, and causes us to 
groan over it. 

29 The papists act contrary to this, and they despair. 
They boast of their many righteousnesses, orders, and 
want to be without sin, which the school teachers teach 
as something possible, and Zwinglius teaches that 
original sin is only a mere defect. Those who despair are 
those who feel sin and die in their consciences, and are 
thus tormented on all sides, so that they must 
necessarily despair. And yet one should not despair for 
the sake of sin, or even for the sake of the fruits of sin. 
For though we fall, yet shall we rise again. 

(30) Finally, this should be kept very firmly in mind, 
that no one is or becomes righteous before God except 
through the blood of Jesus Christ. For God alone is just, 
true and wise. In everything we do, even by faith, we 
should say that it is sin, and "we are worthless servants", 
Luc. 17, 10. But through the righteousness of God alone 
we attain salvation, and through it we are saved. 


1410 


If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving 
ourselves. 


This is spoken against the imaginary saints. To be 
able to believe that the blood of Christ makes us free from 
all sin is a necessary thing, but it is a gift from God. But if 
we remain with our righteousness and boast of it, we will 
not be subject to divine righteousness. How difficult it is 
to leave the statutes of men, we learn from the example 
of Peter. And see what kind of righteousness he causes 
the Gentiles to fall into by his example, to their great harm 
and condemnation. So it is a divine power when one 
renounces piety, that is, trust in his own perfection. The 
flesh and blind reason always resist. 

The monks have taught that their state is perfection. 
We Christians do not boast of perfection, but always pray 
that we may grow in the knowledge of God and Christ, 
as Peter exhorts, 2 Ep. 3, 18. For all our conduct does 
not make us righteous. For "we are justified without merit, 
by His grace," Rom. 3:24. And this must be inculcated, 
lest we despair when we sin, we sin on whatever 
occasion. But, how if the monks rely on the fathers? What 
shall we say of them? | use to answer: If the fathers built 
on the foundation of Christ stubble, hay, wood, they 
finally recognized this in death, they said: | will neither be 
condemned by the evil works | have done, nor by the 
good works | have done be saved, 1) but by the blood of 
Christ | will be preserved. As St. Bernard said: The 
doings of the monks are uncertain, but the doings of our 
Lord Christ are exceedingly sure. 


And the truth is not within us. 


(33) Even if they imagine that they have the truth, 
condemning us and our doctrine as heresy, they do not 
have the truth, but are against the truth. 


1) So put by us instead of, "| shall not be condemned by the good 
works which | have done, neither shall | be saved by the evil works 
which | have done. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 923-92S. 


1411 


V. 9 But if we confess our sin, he is faithful and just 
to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all 
unrighteousness. 


34 This is the other piece, that you should not despair. 
First he speaks: | will deliver you from pride and 
confidence in your own righteousness; then from despair, 
just as if you had no sin. In order that you may be freed 
from Satan's sin, recognize and confess it only before 
God, and give Him glory with David in the 51st Psalm, v. 
5. f.: "| recognize my iniquity, and my sin is always before 
me. In you alone have | sinned, and done evil in your 
sight, that you may be right in your words, and pure when 
you are judged"; that is, that your word may be true, so | 
confess that | am a sinner. And, v. 6: "In you alone have 
| sinned," because before you no one is pure. And in the 
143rd Psalm, v. 2: "Do not enter into judgment with me." 
Likewise from the 9th chapter of Daniel, v. 7: "You, Lord, 
are righteous, but we must be ashamed." Those puffed- 
up saints bring with them a sack full of prayers and alms, 
and trust in their own righteousness, boasting and 
saying: This, that | have done, therefore | have been 
justified before you. The laymen were clothed in a monk's 
habit for the sake of trusting in the good works done by 
the one whose habit it was. But by this very fact they 
departed from the reason, Christ, by seeking 
blessedness in the works of the latter. But "cursed is the 
man who takes flesh for his arm" and puts his trust in it, 
Jer. 17:5. 


But if we confess our sin. 


35. only give this honor to GOD: to you, GOD, alone 
is righteousness due; to you, GOD, alone is this honor 
due, that you be counted righteous, and make him 
righteous who is of faith. 


He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to 
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 

36. God is "faithful" in keeping His promises, "just" in 
giving righteousness to the one who confesses. He 
[namely, GOD] is just. Immediately as if God said: 
Because you say that | am righteous, and am 


1412 


Interpretation on 1 John 1, 9. 10. W. ix, 925-928. 


141Z 





Therefore | will give you my righteousness and make you 
righteous. Therefore, if you can say: We have no 
righteousness, you may be sure that God is faithful and 
keeps his promises steadfastly, that he will forgive your 
sin for Christ's sake; and that he is just, who gives to each 
one his due, and gives to him who confesses his sin and 
believes the righteousness acquired through Christ's 
death, and so justifies you. David confessed his sin; but 
Saul excused it before Samuel, and could not say, as 
David did, "| have sinned." For he only wanted to be 
honored before the people, 1 Sam. 15, 30. This is what 
we do when we confess our sins, so that we do not want 
to be shamed before the people. Saul only wanted the 
prophet to pray for him before the elders of Israel. For he 
did not want to be seen at all as having sinned against 
the Lord; but for this very reason he, along with all the 
hypocrites, was put to shame before God. 

(37) Furthermore, this saying cannot be understood 
from the confession of the ears (although | do not reject 
this either), but from the confession and confession 
before God, where we confess both our sins and our 
faith. God then forgives the sin, gives grace and a quiet 
conscience, taking away the scruples and bites of the 
conscience. 


V. 10. If we say, We have not sinned. 


(38) Not only do we have sin, but we also sin because 
of the weakness of our sinful flesh, or because we are in 
the sinful flesh, and there is a perpetual conflict between 
the flesh and the spirit, as Paul says to Romans chap. 
7:18: "| know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no 
good thing. | may want to, but | cannot do what is good." 
And not only is the carnal lust of a man against a woman, 
and again the carnal lust of a woman against a man, sin, 
but there are many more vicious things, which, in the 
legends of the saints, are claimed to be good morals, 
which 





have taken only the form and appearance of holiness. 
The fathers only looked at the outward sins, but not at 
the inward lust of the flesh, such as envy, jealousy, the 
hostile heart, the fall from faith and hope. Likewise, we 
still have sin, which still bites and tempts to sin, but does 
not reign. But we and our sin are like a bound man who 
is being led to death, who has been stripped of all the 
weapons that could harm him, but he is not yet dead. For 
this reason sin is in our flesh, surging, raging, and 
raging, and it does not cease. For we always love our 
own, rely on our own strength, and do not put our trust 
in the Word, and do not believe God. This, and nothing 
else, is what our flesh wants. But the fathers, and we too, 
do not see such things, but look to the outward works, 
as to the many fasts. 

(39) Fasting does not cure the lust of the flesh, but 
rather weakens the health of the body, as we see 
happened with Bernard. But the best remedy against sin 
is to study diligently in the word of the Lord. Fasting does 
indeed contribute something to the subduing or 
suppression of the lusts, but it does not do or make the 
matter alone; another remedy, which is better and more 
necessary, is required. 


So we say we have not sinned. 
40 Others explain this from the past sin, but | would 
rather explain it (indicatively) from the present. For the 
Hebrew language expresses the verbum praeteriti 


temporis by the verbum praesentis temporis; indeed, | 
perceive that even John often speaks according to the 
dialect of the Hebrews. He means to say this much: we 
have sin, and sin. "For we all lack manifold," saith 
Jacobus Cap. 3, 2. And Paul: "| am carnal, and sold 
under sin. | do not do what | want to do, but what | do not 
want to do, | do," Rom. 7:14 ff. And so the flesh does not 
do what the Spirit wills. Sin is not so dead that it should 
not stir, since we have the lust of the flesh in us; but it 
does not have the 


1414 


Interpretations on the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 928-932. 


1415 





Dominion. And in this alone is a Christian distinguished 
from other men, that sin does not reign in him. 

(41) And even spiritual pride is also sin, if you esteem 
a good work that you have done today; likewise, if you 
only grieve, if you only despair that you have committed 
incest. 1) For this reason one must accuse sin and fight 
against it all one's life. For this reason a Christian should 
not snore and sleep, as the monks do when they have 
said their masses. 

Accordingly, a Christian is righteous, holy, pious, and 
a blessed man and child of God, that is, in the spirit; but 
in the flesh he still has sin. However, because he is born 
again through the Spirit and believes, sin is not imputed 
to him. 


Thus we make Him a liar, and His word is not in 
US. 


43 These are those who consider themselves holy 
and righteous because of their works. For "God has 
decreed all things under sin," Gal. 3:22, "that all the 
world might be guilty of God," Rom. 3:19. And again, 
Cap. 11:32: "God has decreed all things under unbelief, 
that He might have mercy on all." God offers His mercy 
to both the pious and the wicked. Therefore, they are all 
under sin. For mercy belongs to

for the unjust and not for the righteous. For in the sight 
of God no one is justified, therefore mercy is necessarily 
offered to all. 

44 From the time of John the Apostle, heresy sprang 
up, which argues against the grace of God and wants to 
be without sin, and even prescribes a rule of life, 
according to which it imagines itself to be holy. There is 
no doubt that they were preachers of circumcision from 
Judaism, as Paul generally calls them "those of the 
circumcision". The holy apostles, and especially John, 
oppose them. 

(45) A Christian always cries out, Forgive us our sins; 
he must always contend with them. For this reason, 
even though they still cling to him, they are not imputed 
to him. For blasphemy is a great sin; but those who put 
their trust in their own righteousness blaspheme God. 
Such were our monks, who sinned with their imagined 
holiness, thinking that they would not commit any gross 
sins, since they otherwise lived in the greatest security. 
On the other hand, those who have fallen into sin 
through despair also belong to this category. 

Therefore, it is a great gift from God to have His word, 
to recognize sin from the Law, and to believe the 
Gospel. Where either is lacking, God is made a liar and 
blasphemed. 


The second chapter. 


V. 1. My little children, I write these 
things to you so that you will not sin. 


1. he may be called a theologian who can tell us how 
this text rhymes together. We sin in the world, we have 
sin. Who should not be timid in faith at times, like Peter 
at Antioch? Why does the apostle say, "That we should 
not sin"? The apostle's opinion is this: That we should 
be careful, and in the 





Walk in the fear of the Lord. We are not to say, "If this is 
the case, | will sin. For John says, "Sinful desire should 
not rule in you, but you should watch. But even if you 
keep a watchful eye, sin remains, and you sin from day 
to day. Therefore you must be careful. For our spirit 
wants to have food all the time. We must also read the 
Psalms and the Scriptures often and diligently. This is 
our armor. 


1416 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:1, 2. W. ix, 932-935. 


1417 





So that you do not sin. 


(2) That ye may contend against sin, and walk 
carefully. One should not merely pretend with the mouth, 
as the priests and monks do, but one should and must 
contend against sin. | say this so that one may learn to 
recognize himself. For a broken and humble heart does 
not displease God. 


And if anyone sins, we have an advocate. 


Who does not sometimes go off track? | and 
everyone lack praise. We should not despair of the 
mercy of God. He who is conceited about his merits and 
mistrusts the mercy of God commits the same sin. For 
God says: | am merciful to all, even to those who sin 
when they call upon me, Ps. 86, 5. No righteousness is 
so great that it pleases me. So, if anyone makes a 
mistake and sins, let him not compound his sin with 
despair. 

4 The devil always frightens the heart after sin and 
makes us tremble. For this reason he plunges man into 
sin, that he may finally drive him to despair. On the 
contrary, he allows some to live securely without 
temptation, so that they imagine and believe that they 
are holy. And when he tears the word out of the heart, 
then he has overcome. This is his guile: he wants to turn 
the saints into sinners, and the sinners who are still 
confident in their sins into saints. Do not despair of sin, 
but lift up your eyes to where Christ pleads for us. For 
he is our Advocate and Advocate, and prayeth for us, 
saying, Father, for this man have | suffered, and | receive 
him. This prayer cannot be in vain. We have a high priest 
in him, Hebr. 5, 10. 

(5) But although we have had Christ as our High 
Priest, Advocate, Mediator, Reconciler and Comforter, 
we have nevertheless taken refuge in the departed 
saints and considered Christ as a judge. Therefore, this 
text should be written with golden letters, and the heart 


before. Therefore, take hold of him and say: "Lord Christ, 
| know of no other advocate, comforter and mediator 
than you alone, and | do not doubt that you are also 
against me, but | cling to it with my heart and believe it. 
For us Christ is born, for us he suffers, for our sake he 
went to heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and 
prays for us. Satan is working with all his might to blind 
our hearts so that they will not believe what the Holy 
Spirit says through John. How wonderful is the condition 
of Christians! For a man is a sinner, and a righteous 
man. A sinner because of the sin-infected flesh he 
carries about him; a righteous man because of the Spirit 
who draws him back from sin. This state cannot be 
comprehended by any reason. 


JEsum Christum, who is righteous. 


006 He is righteous, and undefiled, and without sin. 
That which | have of righteousness hath my Comforter, 
which crieth unto the Father for me, Spare him; and he 
is already spared: Forgive him, help him! The 
righteousness of JEsu Christ is on our side. For the 
righteousness of God is ours in Jesus Christ. 


V. 2. And the same is the propitiation for our sin. 


7 He sits at the right hand of the Father, not to frighten 
us, but to be the propitiation for us. And yet we look for 
other advocates, other atoners and propitiators for our 
sins. Our sins are too great; they cannot be redeemed 
by our works, but only by Christ's bitter suffering and the 
shedding of His precious blood. Sin causes heartache 
and paints Christ differently than he is, and shows him 
to us through a painted glass. This was also done by 
some teachers, including Cyprian, the holy martyr. 

8 However, this must be preached to the frightened, 
but not to the puffed-up hearts. Christ wants to be a Lord 
and author of life, not of sin, who does not despise a 
broken and humble heart. 


1418 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 935-938. 


1419 





Not only for ours, but also for the whole world. 


(9) It is a foregone conclusion that you also are a part 
of the world, lest your heart should deceive you by 
thinking, "The Lord died for Peter and Paul; for them he 
was sufficient, but not for me. To him then may every one 
that sinneth take his refuge, because he became the 
propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and bear the 
sins of the whole world. For all the wicked are pointed to 
him alone, and called to him; but they will not accept it. 
Therefore it is said in Isa. 49:4, "I labor in vain, and spend 
my strength in vain and useless." Christ is so merciful 
and kind that, where possible, he himself wept for every 
needy sinner. He is the most merciful and the most 
compassionate of all men, who has more compassion for 
every limb than Peter had for a rod or a weal. Imagine a 
man who is exceedingly kind and gentle, and you shall 
know that Christ is much kinder to you. For as he was on 
earth, so is he in heaven. So Christ is appointed bishop 
and beatifier of our souls; but in his time he will come as 
a judge. Seeing this, let us not give occasion to draw 
such things upon ourselves. 


V. 3. And by this we notice. 


(10) The apostle writes against two kinds of people, 
as we said in the beginning, namely, against the 
imaginary saints of works, and against the free spirits 
and secure people who only want to live according to 
their lusts. He wants to say: Where there is a true 
knowledge of Christ, it will not be unfruitful or without truly 
good works. 

ll. So far we have heard how John presented the 
summa and the short content of Christianity, namely the 
true knowledge of God and Christ. Now he reminds us 
that we must also see to it that the knowledge itself is not 
fabricated and falsified. Which we see in many, in whom 
it is not thorough, but inconstant, and as it were like a 
foam floating over the water. These are better, to be 
sure, than the 





However, nothing follows from it, and they are not 
considered to believe truly if they do not prove faith by 
good works. For true knowledge does not consist in 
speculation, but proceeds to action. 


That we know him, if we had his commandments. 


He speaks against all Christians in general, 
especially against the free spirits who remain in their 
former way of life, avarice, ambition, fornication. The 
knowledge of Christ is given to us so that we may fulfill 
the commandments of God. For the first part of 
Christianity is the law, the other is brotherly love, Rom. 
13:8: "Owe no man anything, but to love one another." 
And Matth. 7, 12: "All things whatsoever ye would that 
men should do to you, do ye even so to them." For the 
time being we are freed from sin, and hereafter we serve 
our neighbor with all our strength. And by this you know 
that the kingdom of God is in you, if you do not hate your 
brother. For even if you are sometimes angry, you must 
forgive and consider that you have done wrong. If a sinful 
desire occurs to you, you must neither despair nor desist 
from fighting. A Christian contends against those who do 
not know Christ and against those who do not watch 
rightly, who must be instructed to stay in sound doctrine, 
and must be diligently admonished, though they have 
their deficiencies in both. However, one must not refrain 
from preaching; but the hypocritical and negligent 
Christians must be reminded and admonished, but the 
ignorant and erring ones must be taught at every 
opportunity. 


V. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his 
commandments, is a liar. 


(13) He speaks against the glory seekers, who seek 
nothing in all their doings but to make a name for 
themselves and to gain honor. (John is dealing with sons 
and daughters.) Such are our boasters, who pretend to 
know God and keep His commandments, when they do 
not keep or believe them or His word. For these sayings 
are the same in John, keeping God's commandments or 
keeping God's word, as we can see from the following 
passage. 


1420 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:4-7. 


W. ix, 938-940. 1421 





see the fifth verse. But he who speaks otherwise than he 
is minded is a liar. 


And in such there is no truth. 


14 This is what | said above [Cap. 1, 5., § 19 ff.): "God 
is alight, and in him is no darkness." But in these people 
there are darknesses of untruth, errors and heresies, 
each one inventing his own worship according to his own 
thoughts. They portray God to them differently than He 
is. He wants to say this much: Everything you pretend is 
not true, say and do what you want. And behold, how he 
nevertheless makes a distinction among the sayings that 
one is a liar and that the truth is not in one. For the 
heretics are actually hit with this, who pretend the faith 
of salvation in a lying way, since they did not even come 
to the knowledge of the truth. 

(15) The ugly people, the Donatists, boasted much of 
faith, life, and temperance, and that they laid hands on 
themselves, or killed themselves among themselves. 
For in the morning, when one came to the other, he 
immediately proposed, "Kill me. If the latter did not want 
to do it, the latter threw himself down from a height and 
thus killed himself. These were exceedingly glorious 
deeds among them; and yet the truth was not in them. 
For Augustine, writing against them, says: "For 
martyrdom a cause and punishment is required," and 
ser’j destroyed all their glory. 


V. 5 But he who keeps his word. 


This is a conclusion that the apostle makes from the 
preceding, since the words that precede and are 
explained next contain a dilemma. So | understand that 
John is not talking about the commandments, but about 
the word of the gospel, which he who knows God keeps; 
as Jesus says of Himself, John 8:55: "I know Him, and 
keep His word." 


In such, truly, the love of God is perfect. 


He has comfort in his heart because he loves God 
and his neighbor. 





By this we know that we are in Him. 


This expression is peculiar to John. Christ would say: 
"He who abides in me, and | in him, bears much fruit", 
Joh. 15, 5. |, wretched Christian, am covered and 
enclosed by the wings of grace of Christ, who is the 
eternal righteousness, and | do not want to let sin reign 
in me; therefore | hope, even believe, that | am in him. 


By this we know that we are in Him. 


(19) We have heard that John is talking about 
testifying to our faith by good works and by the fruits of 
love. To love your brother, it is not enough that you do 
not hate him, but you must also do good to him. 


V. 6: He who says that he abides in him shall walk 
even as he walked. 


20 As often as he uses the words: "He who says", he 
always gives a sting to the boastful and conceited 
Christians. This should be the sign by which they can 
recognize whether they are true Christians or not. Where 
Christ dwells through faith, he makes the same people 
similar, namely humble, meek and willing to help their 
neighbor in every need. 


V. 7. Brethren, I am not writing you a new 
commandment, but the old commandment. 


21 The holy man writes this in such a way that he 
wants to take them first and prevent them from the error 
of the false teachers; for John writes against the new 
teachers. He then goes on to attack them, saying: "Do 
not think that | am writing anything new to you; indeed, 
you have enough new things. Wherever the light of truth 
rises, there the devil is present, raising up new teachers. 
Yes, brethren, | write these things that | may preserve 
you in the doctrine which ye have received. So Paul 
reminds us of this in his epistles everywhere. So we too 
must fight with all our might to preserve the teaching 
against the new teachers. Dear brethren, do not think 
that | will teach anything new. | am only trying to keep 
you in the doctrine given at the beginning. 


1422 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 940-943. 


1423 





may. | will keep you in simplicity against the new 
teachers. Remain in simplicity and in the old teaching 
that you have received. Above all, beware that you do 
not boast, that you do not seek glory. In the holy 
scriptures, it is a devilish temptation to boast. Therefore, 
God has decreed that the word of the Gospel should be 
a word of the cross, so that He may suppress vain glory. 


The old commandment is the word you heard 
from the beginning. 


22 "The old commandment," namely, of the Gospel 
preached. From this passage we can conclude that this 
epistle was written shortly before the end of John's life 
(as well as the other epistle of Peter). Even the apostles 
had to tolerate these new teachers during their lifetime; 
therefore it is no wonder that we also have to suffer such 
things today. 


V. 8 Again I write unto you a new commandment, 
which is true of him, and of you. 


(23) It is truly a new doctrine; indeed, it alone is the 
right doctrine. This again goes to the new teachers and 
heretics. If they want something new, let them accept 
this teaching, which is certainly new, which has never 
been known to the world, and which is new to those to 
whom it has been made known, because it renews those 
who accept it from day to day. It is a new commandment 
with Christ who is now revealed, and with us whom it 
enlightens. Therefore keep above this teaching. The 
other teachings will be darkness and not light. In sum, 
beware of new doctrine; even as Paul also saith, "Be not 
swayed and swallowed up in all wind of doctrine, by the 
craftiness of men, and deceitfulness, that they may 
deceive us." Eph. 4, 14. 


For the darkness has passed away, and 
the true light now shines. 


Hereby he condemns the adversaries again, with 
whom the darkness had not yet passed away. They 
have a deceitful light, not the true light; they disguised 
themselves as angels of light and took the form of 
teachers. 


himself. Thus the devil creeps into our hearts, not as if 
he were a hasty evil and false one, but as if he were a 
good and the best spirit, and as if he were an angel of 
light. So do his teachers, who are called servants of 
Christ and deceive people under these titles. But the 
true light shines in him, and in us; we remain in that. But 
they have a deceitful light. 


V. 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his 
brother is still in darkness. 


(25) The heretics cannot refrain from this, for as the 
spirits are, so they bring forth fruit. We are bound to hate 
their teachings and doings. "I hate, O Lord, them that 
hate thee, and am angry with them because they set 
themselves against thee. | hate them in all earnestness, 
therefore they are mine," Ps. 139:21, 22. So | should 
hate them with all my heart. Shall it not grieve me for 
Christ's sake that they should thus pervert the words of 
Christ? "This is my body" means something like, it 
means my body. If we do this, they hate us and cry out 
that we are despisers of love. Outwardly they pretend all 
politeness and love, but inwardly they are full of hatred. 
He who is not in the true light cannot love his brother, 
nay, he would rather that all love should be 
extinguished; only that their doctrines should remain, so 
they conceal their hatred, their persecutions and 
tyrannies under the name of promoting divine honor, 
and a burning zeal for the truth. But he who does not 
remain in the true light does not remain in love. The fruits 
of the spirit do not grow without in the spirit. "A rotten 
tree cannot bear good fruit," Matth. 7, 18. 


Whoever says he is in the light. 


(26) How the spirits of the Reds say this still this hour, 
because of the appearance of the confession. [1) They 
do not realize that they are still in darkness; indeed, they 
say they are in the light. But Christ and his own see that 
they are in darkness, because they obscure the light of 
the gospel. They have the honor of having the gospel 
before the devil. 


1) Inserted by us. 


1424 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:9-12.

and the world. This was encountered by the apostles; 
therefore, it is no wonder that it is encountered by us as 
well. 


V. 10: He who loves his brother abides in the light. 


(27) This is a contrast: the Christians love, and those 
also love. But a Christian would not want them to perish; 
indeed, he would like to see them helped, even though 
they hate the teaching fiercely. Whether it comes from 
holy and good hatred, Christ will judge. 


And there is no annoyance with him. 


28 This is an ambiguous expression, which can be 
understood both from the taken and given accidents. | 


would rather understand it from the candalo passivo, or 
the taken*error, that it means so much as: He walks in 
the light, and is not vexed by those their appearance of 
light, but remains steadily in the light, and does not let 
any vexation challenge him. "Great peace have they that 
love thy law, and shall not stumble," Ps. 119:165. So he 
vexeth no man. .But | believe not that he speaketh of this 
weakness of the brethren. "Love is not provoked"; "love 
never ceases", 1 Cor. 13, 5. 8. A Christian does not 
stumble at anything, but is constant in the knowledge of 
this light; he hears of new teaching, but does not turn to 
it; he hears of persecution, but with deaf ears. On the 
other hand, the adversaries think evil, it may be spoken 
to them kindly or harshly. They turn our sweet words into 
poison and flattery. Paul says: "Avoid a heretical man 
when he is once and again admonished," Titus 3:10, for 
he cannot be moved either to good or evil. "If a wise man 
comes to deal with a fool, he is angry or laughs, he has 
no rest," Proverbs 29:9. 


V. 11: But he that hateth his brother is in 
darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not 
whither he goeth. 

29) To believe in dark things and to hold to them is to 


be in darkness. Everything they do and suffer in this 
opinion of the heart is darkness. They 





think that they go to the kingdom and to glory, and yet 
they go to hell. For John sticks to the similitude he started 
with when he took it from the light of the flesh. 


For the darkness has blinded his eyes. 


(30) The heretics boast that they have the light, but 
they are all darkness. And with these words he wants to 
instruct us in good time, so that we may see what it is to 
deviate from the true light. We do not believe it, but Christ 
knows with what indescribable effort and persecution 
Satan is working to tear this light out of our hearts and 
eradicate it. He inquires little about apparent life and 
change; "he goes about seeking whom he may devour,” 
1 Pet. 5:8, for he finds many not ready, therefore he 
overthrows many. The wind of the devil is great and 
stormy, so that he seeks to extinguish our light. 

Yesterday we heard about the hatred of the godless 
hypocrites. Heretics are also the new teachers who 
introduce pernicious sects, whose hatred, because it is 
splendidly adorned with the best appearance of holiness 
and faith, is not recognized by the flesh without the help 
of the Holy Spirit. For they call their pretensions a zeal for 
the glory of God. For the rest, it deals with hatred and 
gross vices. For the Scriptures have this habit of 
punishing first those who sin under the appearance of 
holiness, and then those who sin grossly. Therefore it 
comes gradually on those who are careless and slothful. 


V. 12. Dear children, I write to you that your sins 
are forgiven you through his name. 


(32) This is a new admonition to the pious, whom he 
hereby admonishes that because they have the sound 
doctrine, they should also bear fruit. It is the same for all 
of them, except that he attributes to the parents a 
knowledge that they, as parents, should have more 
understanding than the young people. John thus 
indicates that the young have a hotter inclination to sin. A 
young 


1426 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 946-948. 


1427 





A man is inclined to lust, a man to avarice and to 
ambition. So there are also spiritual vices, to which one 
has a hotter inclination than the other. Thus David prays: 
"Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my 
transgression," Ps. 25:7. Thus Job says, Cap. 13:26: 
"Thou wilt kill me for the sin of my youth. 

(33) Therefore he boasts that the kingdom of Christ is 
a kingdom of forgiveness of sins, because those who 
have fallen have hope of forgiveness. The wicked teach 
this very thing, but they do not have the same opinion 
and understanding of it. Therefore this must be diligently 
noted, that all may know that this is the summa and brief 
epitome of the sermon, namely, the forgiveness of sins. 
If this is true, it follows that we are under sin and sin. For 
otherwise we would not say, "Forgive us our trespasses," 
Matth. 6, 12. "Who can tell how often he trespasses? 
Forgive me the hidden faults," Ps. 19, 13. The prayer of 
the Lord makes us guilty of sin, and subject to many sins. 
When we pray, "Hallowed be thy name," it follows that 
we do not hallow the name of God. This life is nothing but 
a desecration of the name of God; and by it the kingdom 
of Satan is extended, that it is full of theft, robbery, 
adultery and other offences. The pious alone say: Deliver 
us from this kingdom. 

34. but the forgiveness of sins is not instituted that we 
may be permitted to sin, or that we may sin, but that we 
may know sin; that we may know that we are in sin; that 
we may contend against sin. A physician discovers the 
disease, not that he takes pleasure in the disease, but 
rather that the sick person should sigh and ask to be 
delivered from the disease. But he takes hope to get well 
again from the faithfulness of the physician who makes 
this promise to him. Thus, in Holy Baptism, we too are 
transferred from darkness into light and into the place of 
forgiveness of sins. 

35 It would be good if the Hieronymi and other books 
had not come to light at all, because they are based on| 
our own effort. 








too much. This has given the monks the opportunity to 
torture themselves the more sin dwelt in them. If they fast 
a lot, it is a good remedy against the throat, but in the 
meantime arrogance creeps in unnoticed; one sin is 
pronounced, but a twofold other sin is introduced. Such 
mortifications have their use, but the sins are not swept 
out by them. The heart is kept from breaking out, but it is 
not healed. 


That your sins may be forgiven through 
his name. 


(36) It is not because of the effort of works that sins 
are forgiven, but when | call upon the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, believing that he is the propitiation for our 
sins. This is the truth; but the devil does not let us stay 
on this way, he soon introduces our works. Therefore, let 
no one cling to his own works. Our natural way is this: | 
have sinned with works, therefore | will also reconcile 
God with works. The devil is present who reinforces our 
error. Against this sin we must use this promise: "Sins 
are forgiven through His name." 


v. 13. I write to you fathers, because you 
know him who is from the beginning. 


(37) Have not the Jews also known him, and yet they 
have not forgiveness of sins? Only, they have not known 
the name of him in whom is our salvation, according to 
the saying, "He knoweth my name, therefore will | protect 
him," Pj. 91, 14. Neither have they known him who is from 
the beginning, that is, the eternal Son of God, but another 
and new God, contrary to the commandment of God, Ps. 
81, 9. 10.: "Hear, my people, | will testify among you, 
Israel, you shall hear me, that there is no other God 
among you, and that you worship no strange god." The 
new teachers have invented a new God; they go into the 
deserts, fast, build monasteries, make vows, and say: If 
you do this, you will please God. This is not the true God, 
but a new one; 


1428 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:13-15. 


W. ix, 1429 





because the true God does not look at me because of 
my works. 

Making new gods is inventing new ways, new 
religions, to serve God. Whoever introduces a new 
doctrine introduces a new god, and denies the old one 
that has been from the beginning. This is a true idolatry, 
anew god, that is, worshipping Satan. So everything that 
we have against the prescribed word is nothing but 
idolatry and godlessness. But it is hard for us to believe 
this, who are used to idolatry. 


I am writing to you young men because you have 
overcome the evil one. 


39 John writes to people of all classes, which is why 
he wanted the young to share in the grace. He 
undoubtedly means the age that is still under the 
supervision of parents. For this age needs instruction 
above all others, and none is more inclined to sin than 
this age. 


Because you have overcome the villain. 


The young people follow the impulse of their desires, 
they do not have much reason. In Christ we have victory 
over the devil and against the devil's power. The devil's 
power is death, sin, an evil conscience, by which things 
he rules. He also has shields and weapons, and through 
death makes hearts tremble, inclining the will to sin 
wherever he wills. From all these we are not only 
delivered, but also have the victory over them. He who 
has overcome the world has also overcome the devil. A 
young person who believes in Christ has victory over 
everything that Satan is powerful over. So he has the 
victory: not that sin, evil conscience, death should not be 
felt, but that they should be overcome because Christ is 
greater than they. They have already been overcome, 
but not yet eradicated; a beginning has been made to 
heal the disease, but it has not yet been completely taken 
away. 


Iam writing to you children because you know the 
Father. 


41 Because John here with difference, and after a certain 
division, namely of the 





Age, talk, so he finally calls the children who are lying in 
the womb, as if he wanted to say: Dear little children, 
you also have a heavenly father. But | do not approve of 
their saying that the children do not believe. They say 
that they do not see faith in them, to which | reply, "They 
do not see it in the elderly either. They further object that 
adults know that they believe and profess faith, but this 
is not found in children. But how do you know that they 
are telling the truth, since Simon the Magician boasted 
of this, and yet he was a deceiver? But as sin reigns over 
all, so grace through Christ reigns over all. For as a child 
is made guilty by a strange sin, so he is made righteous 
by a strange righteousness. Reason is against faith, but 
the less it is strong in the children, the more they believe. 
Christ invites the little children to Himself, just as He did 
elsewhere: "Let the little children come to Me, for such 
is the kingdom of heaven," Matth. 19, 14. But He does 
not let anyone come to Him without faith. 


v. 14. [have written to you fathers, that you may 
know him who is from the beginning. I have written 
to you young men that you may be strong, and that 
the word of God may abide with you, and that you 
may overcome the wicked one. 


He wants to comfort and admonish everyone to 
remain in the purity of the word of God. Having 
previously mentioned all the ages, he again mentions 
the fathers and the young men or adults. But he attaches 
to each age such a figure of speech, which actually 
belongs to them, and draws it to the spiritual mind. The 
fathers build a city, the young men defend and protect it, 
the boys are preserved in it. All overcome the devil 
through the word, but in a new way of warfare, through 
the word. 


Vv. 15. Do not love the competition, nor what is in 
the world. 


(43) We have heard so far how John encouraged or 
praised the fathers, the young men, the boys. But he 
praises them because of 


1430 


of the faith they had received, that they might remember 
what a great grace it was that they had come to faith and 
had known it. As if | said, "Gentlemen, you are in true 
knowledge, you have been called to a holy calling: see 
then that you walk worthily according to this calling, that 
you bring forth such fruits of repentance as are fitting for 
the same. "Love not the world." 

44 John speaks to the children in such a simple way 
that it seems as if Erasmus was annoyed by his 
simplicity. But the Holy Spirit is a teacher of the simple, 
therefore he uses simplicity. 

Many do not know what the world is, as we have 
heard enough in Ecclesiastes, 1) since some understand 
by the world even the creatures of God, as the 
Franciscan monks understand money, society, by it. But 
they are mistaken, for all God's creatures are good, and 
Christ himself made use of money and lived in the midst 
of human society. Therefore, in this place, the world is 
ungodliness itself, the human affect, according to which 
aman does not have the true use of God's creatures; as 
is expressed by those who do not rightly recognize God's 
creatures, nor rightly need them, who only make use of 
the things in the world for their own pleasure and honor. 
The world is everywhere subject to vanity; man himself 
is vain, and needs all these things in a vain way. 
Therefore, those who flee the world in such a way that 
they shun contact with other people sin. Likewise, those 
who despise the creatures of God, do not eat meat, do 
not wear this or that garment. These need the creatures 
of God in such a way that they want to be saved by them; 
but this is the spiritual abuse of the world. 

46 But "to love the world" is based on the worldly 
affect and inclination, that one is worldly-minded and has 
his heart set on it. In the world you should be like a 
burning and shining light, so that others may be kindled 
by it. To be in the world,

1431 


To see the world, to feel the world, is something different 
than to love the world; just as it is something different to 
have sin, to feel sin, than to love sin. Abraham had 
possessions and goods, but he did not love them, 
because he distributed them and realized that he was 
set up as the steward of the goods according to the will 
of God. David was a mighty king, but he did not seek his 
own, but managed it according to the will of God. For as 
far as his person was concerned, he said of himself: "I 
am both your pilgrim and your stranger, like all my 
fathers", Ps. 39, 13. He recognized himself for a 
stranger, he said he was a sojourner. David did not 
administer the kingdom according to his will, but 
according to God's will and for the advancement of His 
glory; and thus he did not love the world. Moreover, 
where one oppresses and afflicts the poor, and needs 
other people's goods as his own, there is the world; that 
is wrong. Through Christ | was placed in the midst of the 
world, that is, through baptism, so that by my example 
the others might be confirmed and raised up. For this 
reason it is ungodly to treat the world as they do. 

Christ says: "The Holy Spirit will punish the world for 
sin", Jn 16:8. So the world is nothing else but the people 
who have left God, who do not know anything about 
God, who have turned away from the creatures for their 
own benefit and glory. 


If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not 
in him. 

For the love of God and the love of the world do not 
coincide with each other. It is One thing against which 
the love of the world and the love of God are expressed. 
Jacob says, "They are children that God has given to 
your servant," Gen. 33:5. He who loves his children so 
that they are God's gifts also loves God. But he who so 
loves them that they become children of the world, and 
says: Behold, this is my child, | will gather treasures for 
him, he loves the world. He who so loves his wife, as she 
is a gift of God, does not love the world, because she 
was given by God, Sir. 26, 3. and "children are a gift of 
God", Ps. 127, 3. He who does otherwise, the 


1432 Interpretation of 1 John 2:15-17. W. ix, 954-956. 1433 





loves the world. So if we only take into account the esse 


donum (that it is a gift), then it is right. This is what Jacob 
intended when he said: "The friendship of the world is 
God's enmity; whoever wants to be the friend of the world 
will be the enemy of God", Jac. 4, 4. The cause lies in 
the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes; this is not 
from the Father, but rather from the world, as follows: 


For all that is in the world (the lust of the flesh, the 
lust of the eyes, and the life of hope) is not of the 
Father but of the world. 


(49) The lust of the flesh is of the world; that is, the 
pleasure of pursuing my flesh and giving it free rein, 
which is adultery, fornication, eating and drinking, 
idleness, and sleep. It is not the same with fornicators as 
with married couples. The latter set aside the word of 
God, let their flesh have its way, and do according to the 
lust of the flesh. These have the word of the institution of 
the marriage state, and know that they live in a state 
ordered by God. These are of the world; these renounce 
worldly desires. It is a frenzy to cherish the flesh, that by 
means of it you may exercise all the pleasures of the 
flesh. But when you enter into true and lawful matrimony, 
this raging and frolicking of the flesh falls away. 


Eye candy. 


There are many things that irritate the eyes. | believe, 
however, that avarice is particularly understood here. For 
the eyes do get tired of other things, but they do not get 
tired of money, but always have a desire for more, 
namely for many lying grounds, for fields, for houses. 
Avarice is not satisfied with what it needs, but also 
desires what it can never use. The wealth of the wicked 
is, as the poet says: Tanquam pictis gaudere tabellis, as 
when one takes pleasure in painted pictures. | don't eat 
the pictures, | don't put them on like the clothes, | don't 
wear them. 








| do not sleep on them. From this you can see how those 
do not flee the world who separate themselves from the 
company of other people, who collect riches frequently, 
who build great palaces. So the cardinals, bishops, 
abbots take pleasure in painted pictures and feast their 
eyes on them. That is nothing more to them than a feast 
for the eyes. Are these not of the world? 


Hopeful life. 


This is a great annoyance. Something else are the 
goods of this life, from which we have to maintain it, and 
something else is the hope of life. A Christian is allowed 
to strive for the latter, according to 1 John 3:17: "If 
anyone has the goods of this world," 2c. But in this, 
namely in the hope and splendid way of life, he should 
have an abhorrence, because it is an abuse of food and 
possessions. The like we see in the rich glutton in Luca, 
Cap. 16, 1. ff. Therefore, one should not exalt oneself 
and strive for high things, but be content with what one 
has. But the world is quite different in mind, always 
seeking high things; everyone wants to ascend high; no 
one is satisfied with his condition in clothing, food and 
other things. But such a man is not of the Father, but of 
the world. Where the love of the Father is, there is no 
desire for the world, and for high things. "If we have food 
and raiment, let us be content," 1 Tim. 6:8. 


v. 17: And the world perishes with its lust. 


The outward appearance of the world is great, but the 
imaginations of our desires are even greater, in that we 
desire greater things than the world has. But both pass 
away. It is a pity, that no sooner is it done by a few hours 
than the world's desire is gone. Then they speak: If | had 
known that it would end so soon, | would have stayed 
away. So the unwise build on the sand. 


But he who does the will of God abides forever. 


(53) So then, those who do the will of God, that is, 
those who do the will of God, act wisely and wisely, 


1434 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 956-959. 


1435 





Who believe on the name of the Son of GOD, as he 
elsewhere speaks, and love one another; 1 John 3:23: 
"This is his commandment, that we believe on the name 
of his Son JEsu Christ, and love one another, as he hath 
commanded us." These do not love the world, but 
exercise themselves with fruits of the love of GOD; and 
these do not perish. For just as the will of God does not 
pass away, so also those who do the will of God do not 
pass away and remain forever. This is a wonderful 
teaching on the one hand, that those who stand in the 
knowledge of God know that they will not perish. 


V. 18. Children, it is the last hour. 


Here John begins to discover the reason why he 
wrote this epistle, and we have already thought about 
the reason why he wrote it, namely that the false 
teachers, who filled everything with false doctrines, 
forced him to write this epistle. The Cerinthians and 
Ebionites were waiting for new revelations and a new 
world. Here he publicly points fingers at them and calls 
them anti-Christians, and inculcates the apostolic 
teaching when he says: "Children, it is the last hour. For 
all the apostles speak in this way. 

(55) Before this, | thought about how this time could 
be called "the last hour," since Christ's kingdom was to 
be eternal. And finally | realized that it is called the last 
hour, not because of the shortness of time, but because 
of the nature of the teaching. So, because this doctrine 
is the very latest or last, we must not wait for a new kind 
of doctrine. This teaching is followed by a bright 
revelation. This cannot be said of the kingdom of Moses, 
because it was said that it would be followed by another 
kingdom, that of Christ. Now that this has taken place, 
we must conclude that this is the last hour. And again: 
Because the teachings of the gospel are obscured and 
abolished by the Antichrist, this is the last hour. For 
therefore John recognizes that it is the last time: 
"Therefore we recognize that it is the last hour." 





And as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming. 
(56) There is something omitted here, and it must be 
understood: Thus it has come to pass, thus it has come to 
pass; as pious teachers have said before, thus the heretics 
now rise up, as the Cerinthians, Ebionites, and others, 
whom they have called, with an excellent word, 


antichristos, or antichrists. So when Paul says: 
"Wickedness is already stirring up secretly, but he who 
stops it now must be removed; and then the wicked will be 
revealed," 2 Thess. 2:7, he means that the true Antichrist 
will soon be there, and is already betraying his heresies. 
For this Antichrist argues against the person of Christ, 
another against his humanity, the third against the deity of 
Christ. These are counter-Christians in parts, who are only 
against Christ in certain parts, such as the enthusiasts are. 
Another is against the whole of Christ, and this is the head 
of all, which is the pabstry. For the chief article of Christian 
doctrine is this, that Christ is our righteousness. Now 
whoever attacks this takes away the whole of Christ and 
is the true anti-Christ; the others encourage him. One who 
brings heresy against the person of Christ is not so great 
a heretic as one who brings heresy against the merit of 
Christ. 

There are two kinds of righteousness, my 
righteousness and Christ's righteousness. The gospel 
preaches that we are to be placed in Christ's 
righteousness and transferred from our righteousness to 
Christ's righteousness. Thus Paul says: "We are justified 
without merit by His grace through the redemption that 
came about by Christ Jesus", Rom. 3, 24. "Christ was 
made for us by God for wisdom, righteousness, 
sanctification and redemption", 1 Cor. 1, 30. But the Pope 
has decreed new ways of life by which one is to bring 
about righteousness before God, namely, one's own 
satisfactions. When the Pope taught that our 
righteousness is nothing, and that it is Christ's 
righteousness alone by which we are justified, he was 
saying just as much as: therefore the mass is nothing; 
therefore the monastic life is nothing. 


1436 


Interpretation on 1 John 2, 18. 19. W. ix. 959-962. 


1437 





and their own gratifications are of no use; and thus the 
whole kingdom of the pope would be reversed. They say 
that the merit of Christ makes us blessed, but they 
interfere with their own righteousness. This truly means 
to reject Christ, yes, to destroy Christ, and "to hold the 
Son of God up to ridicule," Heb. 6:6. To do enough for 
sins is as much as to absolve from them, to destroy the 
power of the devil and hell. 

58. But, O wretched Carthusians, who toil so much, 
what is your victory against hell? For when | say: |ama 
Christian and anointed, and yet | will toil this way and 
that, choosing these and those works, that | may be 
saved, and be sufficient for my sin, it is as much as if | 
said, Christ did not suffice for me with his blood. 
Consequently, Christ died in vain. "For if righteousness 
comes through the law, then Christ died in vain," Gal. 
2:21. The impulse of our nature is merely that it wants to 
eradicate sin by its powers, which is seen in Pelagius; 
he was the foundation and cornerstone of all papists. 
That is where the monasteries came from, which are the 
fortresses of the Antichrist. As a result, justification by 
faith in Christ has gradually fallen into contempt, and the 
Antichrist has risen. Now he sits in the holy place; and 
when Christ says, Believe in me, he says, Believe in me. 
Let it be done that Christ is preached, but in such a way 
that his rules and statutes are not preached against. | 
am afraid that most of them die praying that God will 
forgive them for sinning against the rules, and not for 
sinning against the word of the gospel, and therefore 
their condemnation is to be feared. The wretched people 
do not recognize the true physician. When Moses set up 
the serpent of brass, no one could be healed by his own 
efforts until he looked at the serpent, Deut. 21:9. So too, 
when sin bites us, we cannot be freed from it until we 
look at Christ crucified. Therefore we must cling to the 
wounds and the blood of Christ if we do not want to 
perish, Joh. 3, 14. 


And now many have become anti-Christians, so 
we realize that the last hour is here. 


59 John makes this conclusion: because there are 
many unbelievers, it follows that the last hour is here. 
How does it follow? Thus: For when the teaching 
ceases, Christ recedes. But if Christ withdraws, what 
else is there to wait for but the darkness of ignorance 
and the works of darkness? When this night falls, it is the 
last hour. 


V. 19. They went out from us, but they were not of 
us. For if they had been of us, they would have 
remained with us; but that they might be made 
manifest that they were not all of us. 


60 This is lamentable and pitiful, but comforting. The 
wheat is not to blame for the weeds growing up; and the 
truth is not the cause of so many misfortunes. Nowadays 
we are blamed for all the misfortunes that happen in the 
world, and therefore we suffer the most sensitive shame 
and reproach: If he had left the papacy alone, they say, 
perhaps not so many heretics would have risen, perhaps 
the peasants’ revolt would not have happened. But on 
whom does the blame lie? Not of truth or light, but of 
error and darkness. Not the one who flees from 
darkness, but the one who remains in darkness, is the 
antichrist. When they go out from us, it never goes off 
without tumult. Thomas Munzer was among us. But 
since he wanted to be clever and went out from us, he 
became an instigator of sedition, and his henchmen 
came to this city and put everything in turmoil. When the 
boys come with a new gospel, such misfortune must 
follow. | see this misfortune and sigh over it. And | have 
often thought to myself: would it not have been better to 
keep the papacy than to see so much rebellion and 
unrest? But it is better to snatch some out of the devil's 
jaws than for all to be lost. The day will make it evident 
which have been of us, and begotten of the gospel of 
truth, and which have not. "For if they had been of us, 
they would have remained with us." 


1438 


V. 20. And you have the anointing from Him who 
is holy. 

Here he opposes the anointing to the Antichrist and 
the heretics, who expected another Christ or anointed 
one, and another anointing. From these he withdraws 
his own. You already have the anointing and know 
everything that is sufficient for salvation. 

(62) Here the listeners might have said: Dear John, 
you are attributing too much to us. But although a 
teacher understands the mysteries better, there may be 
two or three in the assembly who know all that pertains 
to their blessedness and have the Holy Spirit. For the 
sake of these, he should humble himself and show 
himself humble in the judgment of himself. For you know 
(he means to say) what is necessary for godliness. 

The anointing" means something completely different 
with the Christians than with the Latins. For from this 
passage the pope takes the name of his ordination, 
which he calls the anointing, 1) and does not understand 
that all Christians are anointed in this way. This true 
anointing is nothing else than the Holy Spirit, which was 
poured out at the holy feast of Pentecost. With this, 
Christ was anointed according to his human nature 
without measure, but his companions according to a 
certain measure. Therefore it is said: "Your God has 
anointed you with the oil of gladness, more than your 
companions," Ps. 45:8. This spiritual anointing makes 
kings and priests. Just as it makes Christ king and priest, 
so it also makes us kings and priests in the sight of God, 
that is, believers and elect. The Franciscans and 
Dominicans have their name from the rules of men; but 
the name of the Christians has its name from no works, 
but from Christ alone. For if anyone should ask me 
whether | am a Christian, | am ready with the answer at 
once, and say: | am a Christian by no work, and only by 
faith in Christ. So it is also decided that no one should 
be saved except as far as he is a Christian, that is, who 
puts his trust in works and in faith. 


1) So put by us instead of: "The naming of his order, which he calls 
the anointed one", in the old edition. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. 


W. ix. $62-964. 1439 


merits of Christ. Therefore one is called a Christian by 
this anointing. For Christ imputes all that is his to his 
own, even the Spirit, even the righteousness, even the 
holiness which he has; by virtue of this work of 
imputation and adoption in infancy they are called 
Christians. For by faith we receive all things. Carthusian 
caps do not give it. Christ would have acted very 
foolishly if one could have become a Christian through 
such things. Christ must be preached. So they say about 
Mechtildis, as often as she was challenged by the devil, 
she answered: | am a Christian, because | believe. 
Whoever can say this from the bottom of his heart may 
be assured that the devil will not have the upper hand. 
For if |am a Christian, | now have the anointing and the 
Holy Spirit, and am now a fighter. But what should the 
devil be able to do against this anointing? If you could 
also say so, Satan would not harm you. But we lack 
faith. The whole world puts its trust in itself, and wants 
to be saved by its works; therefore the whole world is 
filled with monasteries. True, they sing: "Come, Holy 
Spirit, and anoint me," but He will not come. But if you 
had a bruised and humble heart, he would come, just as 
in the Acts of the Apostles, in the 10th chapter, v. 44, at 
Peter's sermon, "the Holy Spirit fell on all who listened 
to the word"; these were humble people. 

So here John reminds us from where we are called 
Christians, from the devout Christ. We do not become 
Christians by works, but by faith. By works we can 
become saints before the world, but not before God. 
Paul speaks to Romans Cap. 4, 2: "If Abraham is 
righteous by works, he has glory, but not before God." 
He must have the anointing, that is, the gift of faith, if he 
is to become righteous. For it is by faith, and not by any 
work, that we become partakers of Christ. 

But why does he say of the saints, "You have the 
anointing of Him who is holy"? He distinguishes the 
saints of the devil from the saints of God. Also the devil 
has his 


1440 Interpretation on 1 John 2:20-22. W. ix, 964-967. 1441 





Saints; indeed, these boast of their holiness more than 
the true saints. For the saints of God do not boast easily. 
But certain people are made ten times worse by the evil 
spirit, and that is the spirit of pride, as Jeremiah Cap. 
2:13: "My people commit a twofold sin: Forsaking me, 
the living fountain, they make them fountains hewn out 
here and there, which are not full of holes, neither do 
they give water." So it is a double sin to call that 
righteousness which is not righteousness, and to 
abandon true righteousness. This is what all monks do, 
who first abandon faith in Christ and then put their trust 
in their works. This is what John says here in view of the 
contrast: having the spirit of him who is holy, and not 
having the spirit of him who is holy. 


And know all things. 


The true characteristic of the New Testament is that 
everything is known. For before, in the Old Testament, 
they knew what was sufficient for salvation, but 
nowadays we know everything, and there is no need for 
more. Cerinthus pretended new revelations and a 
greater science, and therefore he seduced many. But 
this one he commands to avoid, because he preached 
another gospel. You know this gospel and everything 
that belongs to faith and Christian life. 


V. 21 I did not write to you as if you did not know 
the truth, but you do. 

Here John confesses that they knew the truth. But 
what truth? That Christ had come into the flesh. For this 
is the most important truth of the gospel, on which all 
other wisdom hangs. 


And know that no lie comes from the truth. 


68 This is a Hebrew saying: Ex veritate nullum est 


seu venit mendacium, out of truth is or comes no lie. All 
this is spoken against the deceitfulness of the false 
teachers, who denied the truth that Christ had come into 
the flesh, and therefore they were liars, as he says in the 
following verse 


says: "Who is a liar unless he denies that Jesus is the 
Christ? Those who are born of the truth and confess 
Christ are not liars. 


Vv. 22. Who is a liar? 


Here he uses the general saying about our misery 
from the 116th Psalm, v. 11: "All men are liars. Dear 
children (he wants to say), although they boast a lot and 
deceive themselves, are we liars because of that? Yes, 
they are rather liars. For we have the anointing, they are 
still waiting for it; but we already know everything, they 
do not know the way to salvation. 


Without denying that Jesus is the Christ. 


70 Hereby he attacks Cerinthum, who was the first to 
begin to deny that Christ is the Son of God, just as 
Pelagius was the first to deny the grace of God. What 
was started by Pelagius was completed by the Pope and 
his followers. What Cerinthus started, Arius 
accomplished. What Ebion started, Mahomet continued. 
So all the heretics and sectarians, all generations and 
peoples rebel against Christ, they rage and speak in 
vain, Ps. 2, 1. But John considers all of them liars. 


He who denies that Jesus is the Christ. This is the 
anti-Christ who denies the Father and the Son. 

This is Cerinthus and others who follow in his 
footsteps. Christ consists of humanity and divinity. He 
who denies its humanity denies the whole of Christ; so 
also he who denies its divinity. "This is the will of the 
Father, that they all honor the Son as they honor the 
Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor 
the Father who sent Him," John 5:23. From this it follows 
that He, the Son, is God. All who deny the Son also deny 
the Father. Whoever confesses the Son also confesses 
the Father. If we have the Son, we also have the Father. 
This is a great comfort for Christians. But he that denieth 
Christ in one place denieth him 


1442 


everywhere. Those, then, who say that he is not Christ, 
who has his body in bread and his blood in wine, do not 
have Christ; indeed, they have an idol in their hearts. For 
they deny the highest attribute of the Godhead, namely 
the omnipresence of Christ. 


V. 23. He who denies the Son does not have the 
Father either. 


This has already been explained in the preceding. 


v. 24: What you have heard from the beginning, 
let it remain with you. 


Our nature is such that we always want something 
new, and are not satisfied with the doctrine given and 
received; and because Satan knows that we are of such 
a nature, he attacks our nature with insinuations, and 
introduces excessive splendor, and awakens new sects 
and doctrines. 


If what you have heard from the beginning abides 
with you, you will also abide with the Son and Father. 


(74) As if to say, If you give place to the antichrists or 
their followers, you will surely deny the Father and the 
Son. For if no new article may be mixed in with the 
doctrine, the former doctrine must be so certain that a 
doctrine different from it may not be admitted into the 
mind. The devil would have me doubt whether what | 
have believed is true. But if you begin to doubt whether 
the gospel was true or not, you are already close to the 
fall, like the first parents. 

For this reason, those who ask, as an example, 
whether it can be proved from the Scriptures that Christ 


is the Son of God, as Erasmus did in his Annotationibu, 
deserve to be reprimanded. For if we let this be torn 
down, we may take care that we do not fall from the true 
doctrine. Above all, we must firmly insist on the principles 
of the first doctrine, so that we are convinced and 
assured of them. But when we have reached a certainty 
in this, then hold on to everything, even if it is not true.

be led after whatsoever will, for a hissing of Satan, and 
despise it. Christ died for you and was raised from the 
dead, and through him you shall be saved. But, says the 
devil, how if the laws of the pope were also kept? If you 
listen to him here, and give room to these thoughts in 
you, you will fall from your foundation and from the 
previous teaching. Therefore Jacobus speaks very well 
Cap. 4, 7: "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." 
He does not say, "Dispute with Satan and with the 
heretic, but resist him in this way: There is God's word, 
if thou wilt believe, well; if thou wilt not, go to Paris, and 
dispute there. If you deal differently with heretics and 
speak kindly to them, the devil challenges you to take 
the word out of your heart. "Avoid a heretical man, when 
he is admonished once and again," Tit. 3:10. But John 
reminds us so diligently, therefore, that we should 
"consider" that we are not in peace and safety. When 
Dina went out to look upon the daughters of the land, 
Gen. 34:1, that is, when the church heard of the 
temptations of the devil and the heretics, and was not 
satisfied with our doctrine, Shechem, that is the devil, 
the defiler of the truth, came and deprived her of her 
virginity. Therefore, "to remain in the truth" is a great 
thing. There are many reproaches, so that we should not 
stay with the old word; but whoever deviates from it by 
just one nail, immediately falls out of the fellowship of 
the Father and the Son. Therefore remain in the truth. 


Vv. 26. These things have I written unto you of 
them that deceive you. 


(76) To you who are deceived | write, but to those 
who deceive | do not write, for they do not return. This is 
what we see. Seldom do those return who are the 
originators of new teachings. So Paul says: "Avoid a 
heretical man, if he has been admonished once and 
again. And know that such a one is perverse and sins 
as one who has condemned himself," Titus 3:10, 11. 
One must not want to bring the devil to the point that he 
should and must be silent. They do not remain silent, no 
matter how much you talk. 


1444 Interpretation on 1 John 2, 26. 27. w. ix, 969-972. 1445 


and write. If you have written once and again, let them 
go, they will not be silent. The devil does not let his 
mouth be shut. 


V. 27, And the anointing that you received from 
him. 

We have already heard above [v. 20] about the word 
"anointing", from which all Christians get their name, 
namely from the ointment. Now he repeats this very 
word, indicating what a great thing this royal and priestly 
dignity is. Kings we are; for we have power over our ills. 
"You will walk on lions and vipers, and tread on young 
lions and dragons," Ps. 91:13. We overcome the flesh, 
death, the devil, hell, not by our powers, merits or works, 
but because Christ is the King and overcomer, so we too 
are overcomers. 

The other dignity is even higher, that we are also 
anointed as _ priests. A_ priest's attributes are: 
prophesying, being a servant between God and men, 
ruling and directing princes in those things that belong 
to God. All his saints have this glory and honor. It is 
given to us by God that our word is the word of salvation, 
for in our mouth he has put this word of his, in the midst 
of us he has established the word of reconciliation. If you 
want to be judged by the judgment of the flesh, the word 
is something bad; but a Christian who teaches the word 
of God is, as it were, God on earth. Thus the Lord said 
to Moses, "Behold, | have set you as a god over 
Pharaoh," Ex. 7:1. Therefore these offices, that we can 
be teachers, intercede, and make atonement, are 
priestly offices. This is our glory and honor, which no one 
can achieve by thought, though it is easily said. 
However, it is a powerful word that the devil fears. In 
spiritual things we are kings over Satan; priests in 
spiritual [things], 1) for we call men to our [that is, to 
God's] 1) fellowship. You see how the apostles do not 
mind at all, no matter what they do. 


1) Inserted by us. 





to repeat that this is such a great honor, if you do not 
deviate from the same. 

Therefore Satan does not rest, that he may draw us 
away from this word. The deceivers depart from Christ 
and leave the office to which they have been appointed. 
Day and night Satan does not cease to pursue us, that 
he may draw us away from the knowledge of the Word. 
This is his verse: "Let us break their bands, and cast 
away their cords from us," Ps. 2:3. There Satan is 
depicted. For he himself rages, he himself rages in such 
kings. He seeks to break us, who are a part of Christ and 
a bond of his word with which Christ binds us. Therefore, 
one must not be tardy if one wants to beware of his 
persecutions. Christianity is a perpetual "battle, not 
against flesh and blood, but against the rulers and 
authorities, against the lords of the world who rule in the 
darkness of this world, against the evil spirits under 
heaven," Eph. 6:12. One must not be safe. 

80 This is the reason why the apostles inculcate the 
same, because they know about these wiles of Satan. 
We are set up as kings and priests, but in such a way 
that we need our office to wage war against the 
adversary. It is a great and important thing to be a priest 
against the prince of the world, and against the mighty 
devils. This now John reminds and warns of; and cannot 
be sufficiently reminded nor warned of, so great is the 
wickedness of the devil. The devil already has 
antichrists, who were thought of before, but he is not yet 
satisfied with them. The more he has, the more he wants 
to have; he has no rest as long as he sees one who 
confesses the teachings of Christ pure and true. If Christ 
had not established his kingdom so firmly, he would 
surely tear apart both the king and his kingdom. 


Stay with you. 


That is, remain Christians. There is an emphasis in 
the word "remain". Many are made Christians and 
accept the word with joy, but they do not remain. Look at 
the Galatians, how abruptly they have changed; look at 
the enthusiasts. All of them have a bad reputation 
because they are out of the anointing,

higher than this anointing, which is an outpouring of all 
spiritual gifts through the Word. For this teaches us all 
things; this also confirmeth them that abide in it, that they 
may have joy, and not be ashamed before him in his 
coming. 

So, when the Sacramentarians say that the word "is" 
is taken for in the institution of Holy Communion, it 


V. 28. And now, little children, abide with him,

teach such. Nor can it make their hearts firm that this is 
true. They also have no joy from this gloss, but they will 
be put to shame before him in his future, because they 
did not remain in the anointing as it taught us. Truly, we 
cannot get the assurance of faith from anywhere else. 
Satan can indeed make a deception that the allegorical 
mind seems to be certain of. For just as he, as an artist 
of thousands, can make a clamor before the eyes of the 
flesh, so that it seems as if he were present, so also he 
can kindle a light in the spiritual eyes, by which many are 
befogged, but not confirmed. The heretics are taken in 
by the false light, but they cannot be made certain by it. 
But the Christians feel in their hearts that it is true, as the 
anointing teaches, and believe that it is so. 


But as the anointing teacheth you all things, it is 
true, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in 
the same. 

(84) All things are spoken in the simplest terms, that 


he may keep us in the word. But it is the same whether

of Christ. For from this comes the joyfulness that we can 
stand by his future. Why then do we walk in hard ways, 
and keep endless ordinances that require only works, 
when it is written that we should abide in Christ? Satan 
contests this, and our nature is inclined to do enough for 
sin and to reconcile God. 

What then must you do when the danger of death 
terrifies you and your conscience bites you? Abide with 
Christ; believe that nothing can be accomplished by your 
works, but only by the righteousness of Christ. "This is 
the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has 
sent," John 6:29. So when Nathan punished David and 
he confessed his sin to him, he added these words: "The 
Lord has taken away your sin, you will not die," 2 Sam. 
12:13. He does nothing more than stay with the doctrine 
of grace and does not even think that he will do enough 
with his works. This was the true teaching of grace when 
he said, "The Lord has taken away your sins," and he 
believed it. So Adam also, after he sinned, did nothing so 
that he might again come into the former state of grace, 
but by the word: "The seed of the woman shall be given

beginning abide with you, ye shall abide also with the 
Son and Father." We stand 


1448 Interpretation on 1 John 2, 28. 29. 3, 1. W. ix, 975-978. 1449 


He was made alive when he "crushed his head", 
Genesis 3:15. Through this word, since he believed in it, 
he was made blessed and righteous without any works. 
Nature is very much against this, and deceives us with 
the glorious appearance of righteousness. 

(87) Therefore we may learn this: we may be enticed 
either by the appearance of holiness, or by death, or by 
the sight of sin, and know nothing of all other ways of 
being justified, but only of the way through Christ. "We 
believe," says Peter, "that by the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ we shall be saved, even as they also. 15, 11. 
These will not be put to shame in the future of Christ. 
For he will glorify his grace, that we may know that his 
grace devours death and hell. He could not do this if he 
did not first convince us all of sin. Now this is it, that he 
saith, "Abide," that ye may stand, and not be put to 
shame. And he that abideth not in him, but leaneth on 
works, though he were a Carthusian, yet shall he not 
stand. Thus, this contains a main admonition to the 
Christian doctrine, which alone makes the tree good. 


V. 29. If you know that he is righteous. 


88 He continues to exhort to the practice of works 
and the fruits of grace, and does this with various 
motives, that he may provoke them to do good; but so 
that we may put our trust in these works. 


should not set. First Christ does this so that the tree may 
become new, then that it may bear good fruit. Where 
does this goodness come from? Not from the fruit, but 
from the root; not from sanctification, but from 
regeneration. For he that is born of him doeth right. 
Therefore, he does not want them to become false 
Christians, but Christians who are endowed with the true 
faith, and thus may please God and do good works in 
the power of God. 


Know also that he who does right is born of him. 


He who boasts that he knows and has the true 
doctrine should also show this faith and knowledge in 
himself. He takes his proof from the effect: He is born of 
God who does right, who demonstrates righteousness 
through fruit, who no longer sins against his neighbor. 
And he who does not practice righteousness against his 
neighbor is not a true Christian, but only an imaginary 
one. God does not want to have such Christians who do 
not practice justice. God loves justice, so those who are 
of God do justice. 

90 Therefore this is the first motive: Whoever boasts 
that he is a Christian and does not practice 
righteousness is a false Christian. For a child must be 
like his father. The other motive of his exhortation he 
takes from the fact that a Christian who is born of God is 
loved by God. And that is why he brings the love of the 
Father to our attention in the following chapter. 


The third chapter. 


V. 1. Behold, what love the Father has shown us, 
that we should be called children of God. 


This is the most fervent love, which burns like a 
furnace of fire, because Christ so loved us, and was 
obedient to his Father, who gave us his Son to redeem 
us through him. Considering this, it is impossible that he 
did not bear fruit. 


should bring. For the heart says to itself, "How shall | 
repay the Lord for all his good deeds that he does me? 
Ps. 116, 12. Therefore see to it that you too are stirred 
up to love. 
What love! 

2. it is said of Mary: "She thought to herself: What a 
greeting this is!" That is, what a glorious greeting, Luc. 
1, 29. So also here: 


1450 


Interpretations of the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 973-931. 


1451 





"What love!" that is, what glorious love! This is more 
emphatic and powerful than if he had said: grace; but he 
speaks: love. What a very high love of God, to which he 
was provoked by no merits or works, but by love alone, 
yes, since we were enemies and persecutors of God and 
Christ. 


The Father has shown us. 


He calls God a "Father. With these words he wants 
to encourage the Christians so that they know that they 
have a reconciled God and the same for a father. 


That we should be called God's children. 


It is not enough that we are called friends, but that we 
are called children of God. This love could not have been 
expressed more strongly and emphatically. But we are 
called children and brothers by GOD Himself. "I will 
preach your name to my brothers", Ps. 22, 23. Likewise: 
"Go, preach to my brothers", Matth. 28, 10. "If we are 
children, then we are also heirs, namely heirs of God, 
and co-heirs of Christ", Rom. 8, 17. It is not enough that 
we become children of God, but we must also become 
famous under this name in the sight of God and the 
angels. But from where are we called? From the love of 
God. 


Therefore the race knows us not, for it knows him 
not. 


(5) This reason is more extensive, because we are to 
be ignited by love. For because we have the love of God, 
we are also called children of God. The world cannot 
understand that a man who has lived in sin and was born 
in sin should nevertheless be accepted by God in grace, 
that he is both God's child and is called God's child. The 
flesh does not grasp this, the world does not accept it, 
but the Scripture says: "Kiss the Son", Ps. 2, 12. And 
even the Son of God calls us: "Come to me, all of you", 
Matth. 11, 28. If we did not have this word, nature, 
because of its faintheartedness, could not grasp it. So 
now speaks 


John: One must not pay attention to what the world, what 
the common people, what the flesh, what the monks 
judge. "We speak of the secret, hidden wisdom of God," 
1 Cor. 1:27, "which the Father has hidden from the wise 
and prudent," Matt. 11:25. Therefore, this is an offense 
against the reason of proof: Should so many holy and 
learned people not have known this? So they say. But 
do not fret about it. The world does not know you; you 
know it is not capable of this fatherly love. That is why 
the world does not know it, nor the universities, nor the 
doctors, nor the enthusiasts, even though they often say: 
| believe in God. The world does not know that the 
Father is of this nature, even though it says that it knows 
God. For nature does not grasp it, unless the anointing 
teaches us. If they believed that God had given us His 
love, so that through it we might become children of God, 
they would behave differently; they would abandon their 
works and condemn all such blasphemies against 
Christ. But now they defend their works stiffly and firmly, 
and persecute us who teach these things. But the Father 
saith, | have given you the Son, that ye through the Son 
might be saved. "I have concluded all things under sin 
and unbelief, that | might have mercy on all." Rom. 11, 
32. Gal. 3, 22. "Therefore whatever is not of faith is sin," 
Rom. 14, 23. Thus to know God is as much as to know 
what He requires of us, what He does to us. But they 
imagine another God. Behold, all things, be they what 
they may, | include under sin; it is my grace alone that 
rules over you. Therefore, if you want to be freed from 
sin, know the Son. Therefore, this is the true wisdom of 
Christians, when one knows that God thus has mercy 
through the Son, and makes all blessed, as many as are 
saved. 


Beloved, we are now God's children, and it has not 
yet appeared what we will be. 


This is the reason he gives again against 
pusillanimity: God loves you. John especially inculcates 
this motive and desires that it be implanted in our hearts. 


1452 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:2-4.

may be deeply imprinted. Likewise, against the 
displeasure: You shall be and be called a child of God, 
seeing that you are in the flesh and blood, and have 
displeasure not only with the world, but also with 
yourself, not yet feeling and seeing that you are God's 
child, because you are in the flesh and blood, and feel 
the flesh. But you shall not be mistaken about this at all. 
"It has not yet appeared what we shall be." 

7 John represents the hidden Son of God, who has} 
revealed himself before, as it were in the shadow, but 
has not yet appeared in full. And God could not hide 
Himself more than He does. Namely, our own flesh and 
blood stand in the way, that we do not walk in the actual 
form and in the sight. God does not withdraw from us, 
but the world, the flesh and the devil weaken our eyes so 
that we do not see God. The world is one cover, the flesh 
another, the devil the third. Through all these lids | am to} 
break through with faith, which is grasped from the Word, 
Therefore we are children of God, not by looking at God, 
but by faith in God. But faith in the Word promises us| 
many things that we will be; only, as long as we are in 
the world, we will be carried away by the temptations o' 
the flesh, seduced by the devil, and it will not appea 
what man's true blessedness will be in the future. "Eye 
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into 
the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared fo 
them that love Him," 1 Cor. 2:9. 


But we know when it will appear that we will be 
like it. 

We will be like or similar to him, but not God himself, 
as Pythagoras thought. For God is infinite, but we are 
finite creatures. But the creature will never become 
creator. However, we shall become like him. God is life, 
therefore we will also live. GOD is righteous, therefore} 
we too will be filled with righteousness. God is immortal 
and blessed, therefore we will also enjoy eternal bliss; 
not as it is in God, but as it is suitable for us, or as w 
can become capable of it. 





Because we will see him as he is. 


When there will be no more cover, we will see God 
"as He is". We will be given over to death, we will see 
the opposite in all things in the world, but it will certainly 
happen that we will see God and Christ. From where 
does John teach this? Because we are already God's 
children. But a child will not be able to be excluded from 
the Father's presence, but will see Him "face to face", 1 
Cor. 13, 12. 


V. 3 And every one that hath such hope in him 
purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 


John does not flatter, but constantly urges that | bear 
fruit, either through love, because since the Father loves 
us, we should also love the brethren, or through hope, 
because | hope to see God. Therefore | must be purified, 
so that | will not be rejected by His eyes, because without 
sanctification no one can see God, Heb. 12, 14. 
Therefore He does not tolerate hypocritical Christians, 
who think it is enough when they believe they are 
Christians, and yet remain beside it in sins and filthiness, 
and do not change. If they sincerely believed that they 
were God's children, they would not be defiled, but would 
sanctify and purify themselves. Therefore Paul 
admonishes 2 Cor. 12, 20: "I fear, when | come, that | 
shall not find you as | will." 

11) But there is an emphasis in the word "who purifies 


himself". For the Greek word: ayvi¢er Eavtov, means as 
much as, he makes himself chaste (castificat sese), 


although it is very well translated in Latin by sanctificat, 
he sanctifies himself. For he that hath this hope 
mortifieth his flesh. "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. 
But if ye by the spirit of the flesh kill business, ye shall 
live," Rom. 8:13. Against these who have received this 
doctrine it is necessary to use such exhortations, that 
they may walk worthily after this profession. 


V. 4: Whoever commits sin also commits injustice, 
and sin is injustice. 


This passage is difficult. For John makes a precise 
distinction among the 


1454 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 984-987. 


1455 





sin (doytiav) and under the wrong (0.uo- jiav), and he 
as it were again confuses these words with each other. 
There was a shameful kind of people among the pagans 
and heretics who considered fornicating, stealing, and 
committing other sins to be no sin, and that it was not 
contrary to the divine law. John goes through this and 
shows that such sins are against the divine law. 

Otherwise, the word "sin" is used of all vices in 
general. But "wrong" means that sin which goes so far 
as to annoy one's neighbor. We are all sinners, and fall 
into sin at times; but a true Christian, when he falls, soon 
returns and turns back, and contends against sin, lest it 
break out to the annoyance of his neighbor. It is indeed 
a hard thing to be careful in war, lest one should receive 
a wound; but it is an honor if one gets up again, but if 
one flinches, that is a disgrace. So also a Christian, even 
if he is surrounded by sin, yet he contends with sin. 
There are Christians who think they are Christians 
because they are baptized; they let their lusts take over; 
they are not concerned about how to overcome sins, but 
follow their lusts. 

14 "To sin" is as much as to follow the stimulus and 
desire to sin. Many let their sinful lusts run wild; they do 
not want to repent, nor do they want to rise again. Today 
they commit adultery, tomorrow they want to live 
chastely. It is impossible that they should not give 
offense to their neighbor. If not positive, certainly 
negative, in that they do not let happen to their neighbor 
what belongs to him. For the other part of Christianity is 
love. But love seeks [not] 1) what is yours. To seek what 
is one's own is not to love one's neighbor, but to follow 
his desires. Consequently, not to have love is as much 
as to do wrong. He who does not chastise himself, who 
does not contend with himself daily, gives way to sin and 
does wrong. He who does not show the fruit of his flesh 
does not show the fruit of his neighbor. If | do not show 
myself 


1) Inserted by us. 


If | have died, if | have not given up the care of pleasure, 
how can | seek that which is another's? Therefore, he who 
does wrong does not have love. 


V. 5 And ye know that he hath appeared that he 
might take away our sin. 


When the Scriptures speak of the future of the 
Messiah, they are not easily silent about His merit, which 
is that He takes away sin, Ps. 40:10 ff. Jer. 23, 6. Joh. 10, 
11. 1 Tim. 1, 15. First you have to look at His merit, then 
at His example. Therefore do not boast that you are 
Christians, by which you deceive yourselves. He appeared 
in the flesh to take away sin, not to give freedom to sin. 
Christ willed to present to himself by his blood a holy 
church, not defiled. "Christ loved the church, and gave 
himself for it, that he might sanctify it, and cleanse it with 
the bath of water in the word, that he might present it to 
himself a church glorious, not having spot, or wrinkle, or 
any such thing; but that it should be holy and without 
blemish," Eph. 5:25, 26, 27. This is a new motive, that he 
might exhort them, that all they which commit sin should 
strive against Christ. Therefore be assured that you are 
contrary to Christ. "For your sakes my name is 
blasphemed among the heathen," because ye care not for 
holiness. Is. 52, 5. Rom. 2, 24. It is the same today: those 
who hear the gospel increase in wickedness, in 
unrighteousness, in avarice. There is no one who thinks 
what it is that Christ has taken away sin. For for this cause 
he took away sins, "that he might purify us unto himself a 
people for a possession, diligent in good works," Titus 
2:14. This is an important and strong motive to admonish 
Christians. 


And is no sin in him. 


16 Sin is in us, but in him there is no sin at all. For he 
did not seek his own, but did all things for our good. And 
he also had to be without all sin who came to take away 
sin. 


1456 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:6-8. 


W. ix, W7-S8S. 1457 





V. 6: He who abides in him does not sin. 


(17) All this is spoken against the hypocrites. They 
say they know God, but in fact they deny Him. "They 
know nothing of God, | tell them to their shame," 1 Cor. 
15:34. Whoever is in Him, that is, in Christ, does not sin. 
For where Christ is present, sin is conquered. For "those 
who belong to Christ crucify their flesh along with their 
lusts and desires", Gal. 5, 24. Even though they sin, they 
"do not let sin reign in their mortal body, to obey it in their 
lusts", Rom. 6, 12. 


He that sinneth hath not seen him, neither known 
him. 

18 "To see" and "to know" is, according to the saying 
of John, as much as to believe. "He who sees the Son 
and believes in Him has eternal life," John 6:40. "This is 
eternal life, that they may know You, Father, who alone 
are true God, and whom You have sent, Jesus Christ," 
John 17:3. Consequently, he who sins does not believe 
in Him, for faith and sin cannot stand together. We can 
indeed fall, but we must not indulge in sin; the kingdom 
of Christ is a kingdom of righteousness, not of sin. 


V. 7. Little children, let no one deceive you. 


(19) As those do who make freedom of the flesh out 
of freedom of the spirit. We see that today we are free 
from the rod of the driver and from bondage, and yet we 
do no good. Therefore, let each one live in such a way 
that he may serve others. If one teaches others from a 
sincere heart, that is serving one's neighbor. Everything 
we have must be at the service of our neighbor. A heart 
that is open to the neighbor and willing to promote his 
salvation, God sets it up so that there is no position in 
which it serves itself alone. A woman is set to serve her 
husband; a man to serve his wife. So also the authorities 
are appointed to govern the commonwealth, to punish 
the guilty, and to protect the innocent. But he who seeks 
honor is not in love. The life that serves others is only a 
human life. 





He who does right is righteous, just as he is just. 


20. Do not declare anyone to be a Christian unless 
you see that he demonstrates this by his works. Where 
you see anger, envy, avarice, arrogance, 2c., do not call 
him a righteous man; such a one does not do right or 
practice righteousness. But where you see fruits of 
righteousness flowing from the righteousness of faith, 
you may call him a righteous man, for he exhibits 
righteousness and imitates him who is righteous. 


V. 8: He who commits sin is of the devil, for the 
devil sins from the beginning. 


21 Hereby John explains what kind of sin he was 
talking about here. The devil sins in the way he sins from 
the beginning: he is not displeased with himself, it does 
not repent him; yes, he rather takes care that he may 
sin. Thus the hypocrites and epicures sin. But penitent 
people do not do so. A Christian may fall, but he 
immediately feels this poison and is sorry. 

(22) If this is what happened in the church in the time 
of the apostles, it will also happen to us. At that time 
there were those who deceived themselves with the 
name that they were called Christians. That is why the 
preachers of the divine word always had something to 
do and to admonish. Christ does indeed let his own fall, 
but he is there quickly and makes them rise from sin; as 
can be seen in the example of Peter, whom the Lord 
looked at, as well as Adam and David 2c. He offered 
them a helping hand, so that they repented and rose 
from sin. Thus David says, "| am afflicted daily, and my 
punishment is every morning," Ps. 73:14. When | would 
forget, Christ was soon there with the rod, saying, "Have 
you done this? 


For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he 
might destroy the works of the devil. 


Here the first sermon of the gospel is fulfilled. The 
seed of the woman was to be born to destroy the works 
of the devil. Now he has appeared in the flesh and 
destroyed them. For "he hath taken off the principalities 
and the powers, and hath destroyed them. 


1458 


Wore publicly, and made a triumph of them, by Himself," 
Col. 2:15. 

24 Thus Christ once bore the sin of the world, but he 
does not cease to take it away still continually ‘in us, 
through the strife of the spirit and the flesh. These two 
princes cast each other out. Christ destroys the works of 
the devil, the devil destroys the works of Christ. Christ 
builds in us love, humility, chastity, 2c. the devil builds in 
us impurity, fornication, strife, pride. If you feel that your 
mind is such that you do not want to sin or commit 
fornication, or if you feel such things and yet resist them, 
if you feel that you are inclined to mercy, Christ has 
already done his work in you. But if you feel the opposite, 
as an inclination to adultery, fornication, 2c., if you see 
your brother suffering hardship, and do not come to his 
aid when it is in your power, the devil already has his 
work in you. Therefore it is easy to know among whom 
you are. If you are under Christ, your works show it. But 
if you are under the devil, the works also show this. For 
"the works of the flesh are manifest," Gal. 5:19. 


V. 9. who is born of God. 


(25) This has already been said above [Cap. 2, 29]. 
He is born of God who believes, and who is not a false 
Christian nor a pretended Christian. 

He does not sin, for his seed abides with him. 

(26) This is a repetition of the foregoing, wherewith 
he magnifies the matter. We, who are Christians, do 
nothing out of pretense. Being born of God and sowing 
sin are contradictory things. For if the flesh wants to sin, 
being born of God speaks thus: Not thus, not thus; for 
the seed of God abides in him. But the seed of GOD is 
the word of GOD. Therefore Peter says: "We are born 
again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable seed, 
that is, of the living word of God, which abides forever," 
1 Petr. 1, 23. According to this, "to be born of God" is as 
much as to sweep out sin, since sin is put on the burnt 
spit. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 988-992. 





4459 


And cannot sin; for he is born of GOD. 


There is nothing easier than sinning. But these are 
contradictory things, "being born of God" and "sinning. 
As long as the birth exists, and as long as the seed of 
God remains in a reborn man, he cannot sin. He can 
indeed lose the birth, and sin; but as long as the seed of 
GOtt is in us, he does not suffer sin beside himself. For 
Christ is the propitiation for sin. This seed sitteth in the 
heart, and keepeth Christ in the heart, that thou consent 
not to sin. If you look at a strange woman or money (to 
desire her), he says: Brother, brother, let such desires 
go, you are born of God. Sin is tempted, it grumbles, and 
would like to rule; but do not let it rule, its will shall be 
subject to you. If you are provoked to anger, to lust, to 
envy, keep the seed of the living GOD with you, and you 
will suppress these lusts within you. To walk in safety is 
to live in sins after losing Christ and the birth from God. 
God protect us for that! Now where the works of the devil 
are in a man, Christ cannot be there. Just as the devil is 
not idle, so Christ is not idle. "The devil walketh about as 
a roaring lion," 1 Pet. 5:8. Neither doth Christ sleep, but 
is stronger than the strong. "Little children, he who is in 
you is greater than he who is in the world," 1 John 4:4. 


V. 10. This reveals which are the children of God 
and which are the children of the devil. He who does 
not do right is not of God, and he who does not love 
his brother. 


28. It is as much as if one were to say: He who is not 
righteous is not of God; and he who does not love his 
brother is not of God. Christianity consists of two parts, 
faith and love. Faith is a covering or a mercy seat that 
covers infinite sins of which we are guilty before God. For 
through faith all sins, even the hidden ones, are 
swallowed up. Love, however, holds back the revealed 
sins, even though we are guilty before God. 


1460 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:10-14. 


W. ix, 992-995. 1461 





God are burdened with many sins. However, he is talking|that his brother's sacrifice was graciously regarded by 


about sin here, since one is inclined to sin. Moreover, 
there is no one who does not sin. He is talking about the 
safe spirits who, after hearing the word of grace, do not 
serve their neighbor. 

Our works are nothing before God, but we have the 
forgiveness of sins as a gift through Christ. The works of 
love are testimonies and seals of our faith, by which we 
prove that we are God's children. The promises of love 
and good works are attached to the promises of faith in 
order to testify to faith. 


V.11. For this is the message which you heard from 
the beginning, that we should love one another. 


30 Above he inculcated this, that we should believe; 
here he inculcates that we should love. These are the 
two messages of the whole Gospel, namely of faith and 
of love. By faith (we prove that we are God's children) 
before God, by love before the neighbor, or against the 
neighbor. 

(31) Accordingly, he will speak here of two kinds of 
people who do evil against love. The first are the 
hypocrites, who are most offensive under the 
appearance of love. Many seem to have love, but they 


God, Gen. 4, 6. Look at our monks, our priests, the holier 
they are, the more poisoned they are. This is what 
hypocritical piety does. Look at the observant ones. 
When the preaching monks want to go higher, they take 
up an undying hatred against the others. Such a thing 
may be supposed only of the Cainites, that is, of the 
saints who think themselves righteous. So they 
persecute us because our opinion is true and holy. "For 
that | love them, they are against me," Ps. 109:4. But they 
hate us in a twofold way. Some hate us for money, but 
others hate us for truth. If we were of one mind with them, 
and believed the lie, we would be their friends. Therefore, 
when their rage breaks out, we console ourselves with it. 

Therefore let us pray God to keep us in the simplicity 
of the word. Even if we cannot understand how Christ is 
and comes into the flesh, there is nothing in it, yet we 
want to remain with Christ. | can believe nothing but what 
Christ taught. If he has deceived me, well and good; as 
Augustine says. 


V. 13. Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the 
world hates you. 
He is still talking about the first kind of people, that is, 


do not; such are the enthusiasts; if only their adversaries|the saints. It is not surprising that the brothers also 
would be completely put to death, that is what they|persecute us. Cain persecuted Abel, Esau Jacob; and so 
desire, that is what they ask, that is what they strive for.|also all false brothers persecute those who are born of 
However, they praise love. Thus, under the appearance! God. 

of love and godliness are sometimes hidden the greatest 
death throes. The other kind of those who sin against 
love will be discussed below, v. 15. 


V. 12. Not like Cain, who was of the wicked, and 
sle Ww his brother. And why did he slay him? Because we do not belong to the kingdom of death and darkness. 
his works were evil and his brother's righteous. So nowadays we would receive great praise if we would 

This was especially because of the piety. Cain was|join their party. But Paul has depicted their way: 
apparently very pious, the firstborn and priest of Adam. |"Because they measure themselves by themselves, and 
Cain considers himself holy, as well as Abel, but God|think only of themselves, they understand nothing," 2 


judges otherwise. He immediately became angry, and/Cor. 10:12, 18. Zwingli praises Oekolampad, 
when he saw, he disguised his gesture, Oecolampad praises Zwingli, but Paul praises himself. 


V. 14 We know that we have come out of death into 
life, because we love the brethren. He who does not 
love his brother remains in death. 

This is what annoys the devil, because he sees that 


1462 Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. W. tx, 995-997. 1463 





not so. "We must not count ourselves among those who 
praise themselves. For therefore is no man proficient, 
that he praiseth himself, but that the Lord praiseth him." 


That we have come out of death into life. 


The world hates us because we have been lifted up 
by the roots, as it were, from death and the power of 
Satan, and have been transferred to life. Although this 
transference is hidden from us, the devil sees it well; 
indeed, we ourselves know that we are transposed 
because we love the brethren. Brotherly love is a proof, 
therefore we know that we are transferred into life. By 
this single proof | declare that | am translated into life 
when | love the brother, even though | feel other sins in 
the flesh. 


V. 15: He who hates his brother is a 
murderer. 


37 With this he looks at the other kind of people who 
hate their brother out of an obvious dislike. This is what 
Christ means, Matth. 5, 22: "Whoever says to his brother, 
Racha, is guilty of rath 1)." A mark of wrath is a death 
blow. Now everyone who is angry with his brother in his 
heart, or hates him, is also a man of death. So everyone 
who is envious of his brother kills him, he wishes him 
every evil, and if God fulfilled his wishes, then the brother 
would have to be plagued with all sensible misfortune. 
By this characteristic we recognize the wicked and the 
children of wrath, just as by their fruits. For "the wicked 
have tails like scorpions, and thorns are in their tails, and 
their power is to offend men," Revelation 9:10. Now if 
anyone says he loves, and yet has a bitter heart against 
others, and a thorn in his tail, he is a scorpion. The heart 
certainly tells us enough of such hatred, and if others do 
not see it, we still recognize it from its signs. 


And ye know that a man that is slain hath not 
eternal life abiding with him. 


1) "Raths" put by us according to the Bible, instead of: "court". 


(38) This is the other kind of people, who do not make 
such a great pretense, but who are open enemies; and 
these he accuses not because of their dissimulation, but 
because of their cruelty. Hating is actually a characteristic 
of those who are not holy. But though others also hate, 
they do not do it so vehemently. 

39 Accordingly, John acts against false Christians 
everywhere, because he says: "Love is not such a thing 
as can be hidden, for love thinks and speaks well of the 
neighbor. When | teach a brother, when | comfort him, 
when | pray for him, all this can be seen. Love is a 
manifest thing; not, as the sophists say, love is only a 
good will. For love advances to works. "Love is 
longsuffering and kind, love is not jealous, love is not self- 
willed, it is not puffed up, it is not unthoughiful, it does not 
seek its own, it does not allow itself to be tempted, it does 
not seek harm, it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but 
rejoices in the truth; it tolerates all things, it trusts all 
things, it hopes all things, it endures all things," 1 Cor. 
13:4 ff. According to this, love is a very obvious thing. 

(40) As Christ laid down his life for the brethren, so 
we also ought in certain cases to lay down our lives for 
the brethren. Just as love is manifested in Christ, so it 
should also be manifested in us, and love for our 
neighbor should not be neglected. A true Christian is 
good at all times and in all places. 


By this we have known love, that he laid down his 
life for us; and we also should lay down our lives for 
the brethren. 


(41) All the cases in which we should lay down our 
lives for the brethren cannot be expressed; but this is the 
highest, when we lay down our lives for the account of 
the word. If a prince persecutes a preacher, let him not 
flee; as Athanasius did. If | see that the faith of a brother 
is in danger, | should teach him, comfort him, and lay 
down my life and everything for him. Suppose | were 
called to a council, and | wanted to flee to another 
country, | would not be able to do so. 


1464 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:16-18, W. ix, M7--1000. 


1465 





To leave would be as much as to leave the brethren. 
Starting a new doctrine and abandoning the old one is 
as much as abandoning the brethren. That is why we 
speak of the salvation of the brethren when they are in 
danger of their souls. For in the same way as Christ gave 
his life, and the apostles theirs, so we should also give 
our lives, that is, for the confirmation of the brethren in 
the faith. There are also other cases than in the time of 
the plague, when teachers and preachers should endure 
to lay down their lives for the brethren. 


v.17. But if anyone has the goods of this world, 
and sees his brother in want, and closes his heart 
against him, how will the love of God abide with him? 


42. should one die for the brethren, rather should one 
give his goods and chattels for them. If | have goods and 
do not share them, | do not feed them, | do not water 
them, | do not clothe them, 2c. that is, | am stingy and 
meager, | am not a Christian. And nowadays there is a 
great cry about the fact that those who have learned 
Christ scrape together more money than others, so that 
God now wants to show His wrath. God is merciful, but 
He is not idle and does not leave sinners unpunished. 
He is merciful to the humble who fear him. 

(43) It is foolish and ungodly that some have 
understood these words of extreme necessity. For the 
rest, love has several degrees: one should not offend an 
enemy, one should help a brother, one should give 
sustenance to a housemate. You know Christ's 
commandment about loving one's enemies. But we owe 
more to a brother who loves us back. He who has 
nothing to live on should be helped. But if he betrays us, 
what should we do then? We should help him again. But 
you owe your own the most. "But if anyone does not 
provide for his own, especially for his own household, he 
has denied the faith and is worse than a heathen," 1 Tim. 
5:8. This is a general rule: he has no love who has 
possessions and goods, and yet does not take his 
neighbor's need to heart. 


V. 18 My little children, let us not love with words 
nor with tongues. 


Here John concludes his exhortation to love, and 
returns to where he began, that he summarizes it briefly, 
namely: We shall love, and that, not with words, nor with 
the tongue, but the whole man shall love; as we have 
Christ's explanation of it, Matth. 22, 37. ff: "You shall love 
God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and 
with all your mind. This is the noblest and greatest 
commandment. The other is like it, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself." There are many who only pretend 
to have love. But love "shall not be false," Rom. 12:9. 


But with the deed and with the truth. 


For the kingdom of God does not stand in words, but 
in power," 1 Cor. 4:20. Therefore he calls every Christian 
a brother, because there is a brotherhood among 
Christians. Brothers are to share in the same 
inheritance. Besides, it is a bad thing to love only a 
brother who is kind and friendly. So also the world loves, 
according to the verse: 


Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat. 


That is, the common people keep friendship only with 
those people from whom they benefit. Accordingly, he 
does not say, "Let us love the holy, pleasant, rich 
people," but rather, "The brothers,” so that one's love is 
not focused on anything but the brotherhood, because 
one loves a brother not for benefit, not for honor, but out 
of obligation. All the gifts we have should serve those 
who do not have them. For example, he who is learned 
should serve the unlearned, a rich man the poor, a wise 
man the foolish. This is something easy if you love 
Paulum and other apostles who serve you even after 
their death. But to love the weak, the morose, the 
unlearned, that is truly loving. Otherwise it is not a 
brotherhood, but a carnal being. With a little: The 
Christians' duty is to serve not their own, but the 
brothers’ benefit. 


1466 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1000-1003. 


1467 





V. 19. By this we know that we are of the truth. 


(46) It is a testimony by which we may be assured of 
our profession, and by which we may be confirmed that 
we stand in the truth. If | do not let my neighbor's 
weaknesses go to my heart, | certainly do not love him. 
From the fruits of love we can know that we have love. 
Faith is fortified by fine exercise, use, and fruit. For if one 
surrenders to laziness in his life and walk, it is difficult for 
him to lift up his heart to GOD. Faith alone raises us up. 
Therefore, faith must be put into practice so that we may 
be freed from an evil conscience. 


And can still our heart before him. 


The good conscience of our well-conducted life is the 
most eloquent speaker who persuades us to keep the 
faith, because we know by our works that our faith is 
true. And my conscience will one day bear witness to me 
before the face of God that | have not been an adulterer, 
that | have loved my brother, that | have helped the poor; 
although there are always many things in which we have 
offended our brother. 


V. 20. That if our heart condemns us, God is 
greater than our heart and knows all things. 


(48) Though thou lackest works, yet shall not thou 
lack faith. Even if you lack conviction of heart, faith and 
hope are greater. If you are troubled by the negligence 
of your life, you must not despair because of it. For the 
summa of the Gospel is this, that thou shalt believe and 
hope. We should consider ourselves unworthy, but 
accept the offered grace and the gospel. If our 
conscience makes us fainthearted and presents God as 
angry, "God is greater than our heart. The conscience is 
a single drop, but the reconciled God is an ocean of 
consolation. One must overcome the fear of conscience 
or despair, although this is something difficult. 





(49) This is an important and exceedingly sweet 
promise, "that if our heart condemns us, God is greater 
than our heart, and that he knows all things. Why does 
he not rather say that he does and is able to do all 
things? When one's conscience punishes and 
condemns him, he becomes afraid and says with David: 
"My sins have taken hold of me, that | cannot see; theirs 
is more than the hair of my head, and my heart has 
forsaken me," Ps. 40:13. He cannot speak, Ps. 49:6 
[Vulg.]: "Should | fear 1) in evil days, when the iniquity of 
my transgressors surrounds me?" Then a sinner sighs, 
and says, | know not how to counsel myself. But against 
this darkness of the heart one says: God knows 
everything. The conscience is always fearful and closes 
its eyes; but God is deeper and higher than your heart, 
and searches its innermost parts more closely. He lights 
a light for us and opens our eyes so that we can see that 
our iniquity has been taken away from us. Satan often 
troubles our conscience, even when we do right. For 
example, if someone is challenged for not celebrating 
Mass, the devil can make him uneasy and take away all 
the scriptures that previously encouraged him not to 
keep the statutes of men 2). But then one must close 
one's eyes and think that God is wiser in His words and 
that we will not be saved by such vain works. So, when 
one leaves the monastic state and leaves the 
monastery, the devil can make him restless because of 
it and suppress the joy of the heart. But here he must be 
resisted, since God, who strengthens you in the truth, is 
more powerful than the devil. 3) "They serve me in vain, 
because they teach such doctrines as are nothing but 
the commandments of men," Matt. 15:9. The devil 
sometimes makes the best things evil, and the evil good; 
he makes the good low, and the evil he makes high. 
From a small

who strengthens you in the truth".

ner laughter, he can make the eternal damnation. But 
you must always remember: 


God is greater than our heart. 


The heart knows not what is right; God knows all 
things, and teaches me better in the word of the gospel. 


Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we 
have joy unto God. 


(51) Joyfulness and condemnation cannot stand side 
by side. For if you have a joyful trust in the grace of God, 
your heart does not condemn you. Love cannot satisfy 
your heart, because it is often only with words and with 
the tongue [v. 18.], but faith makes you calm, which is 
the victory against the world and hell, | John 5, 4. ' 

52 From this it is easy to understand why the devil 
plagues us and is opposed to the word and tries to take 
away the word. For when the word is taken away, faith 
is also taken away. If faith is taken away, the tranquility 
of the heart is also taken away. If he cannot prevent the 
word, he endeavors to prevent faith, that we should not 
believe the word, and makes a menace of the word. If he 
cannot prevent faith, he tries to prevent prayer, and 
involves man in so much business that he cannot pray. 


V.22. What we ask we will take from him, for we 
keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in 
his sight. 


53. namely, if we have joy to him. God is almighty, 
therefore he wants us to ask for everything that is useful 
to us. You must have a belt or a begging bag of all kinds 
of need. Satan seeks to bring all evil upon us. Therefore, 
on the contrary, we must seek to avert all evil through 
prayer. God wants to pour out His goods to us with a full 
hand, if only there were people who would ask Him for 
them and pray with confidence. That is why our heart 
must be filled with confidence. When the joyful 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:20-24. 


W. ix, img-ioos. 1469 


If prayer is enlivened with joyful confidence, the devil is 
greatly assaulted. This is why we often complain that we 
do not know how to pray with joyful confidence. No one 
can pray unless he has joyful confidence. 

God does not always give what we ask, nor does He 
give it according to the time, place, and persons we 
would like to have it. But John wants to say that 
everything is heard, even though it is not known what is 
heard. Christ also, when he asked for his life, was heard. 
But our flesh does not know the manner of the answer. 
Therefore, all our prayers are answered, and whatever 
we ask is done, although we do not know in what way. 
God puts us in misfortune, which is sometimes greater, 
so that He may put an end to another misfortune. And so 
he hears our request. 


For we keep his commandments. 


These are the evangelical commandments of faith. If 
we keep them, we will fear nothing. He who believes 
keeps his commandments. 


V. 23. And this is his commandment, that we 
believe on the name of his Son JEsu Christ, and love 
one another, as he has given us a commandment. 


Human frailty has too narrow a heart to be able to 
grasp this grace, the Son of God, who died for us. This 
is the most noble commandment, that we should believe 
in the name of His Son. The other part of it is that we 
love. All other works are pleasing to him where we 
believe. The summa is therefore this: believe in the 
name of the Son of God, and love your brother. 
Therefore one should pray: "Do not take away from my 
mouth the word of truth", Ps. 119, 43. 


V. 24: And he that keepeth his commandments 
abideth in him, and he in him. And by this we know 
that he abideth in us. 


(57) Hereby he begins a new exhortation, as | see it, 
for the preservation of the purity of the doctrine, against 
the spirits that corrupt it. For the devil revolts against the 
word as soon as it is again 


1470 


and does not rage more than when he sees that the truth 
of the doctrine has been established. 


In the spirit that he has given us. 


For whoever does not despise the word of God, it 

gives him the firstfruits of the spirit, so that he may know 
that he is in God, and God in him, since he feels that he 
is invited, that he judges differently, that he is of a 
different mind. 
When we were in the papacy, we thought that the 
masses and orders were pleasing to God. There was the 
judgment that such things were wholesome and right. By 
the help of the Gospel, however, we judge that we are 
justified by Christ alone. Therefore | reject their robes, 
and please myself in the righteousness of Christ alone, 
and attain a new sense, that | say with Paul, "What was 
gain to me, that | counted loss for Christ's sake," Phil. 
3:7. This sense and spirit does not come from us, but 
from the judgment of the Spirit, which the Father has 
given us. From this same spirit we judge 


Interpretations of the 1st Epistle of St. John. Johannis. W. ix, ioos-1009. 





1471 


We say that the sects and orders are ungodly and that 
they are not pleasing to God. On the contrary, anyone 
who considers this doctrine contemptible and low, who 
still wants to consider fine works holy, who seeks his 
own righteousness and does not want to be subject to 
God's righteousness, cannot grasp that the blood of 
Christ alone makes us clean from our sins, and cannot 
concede this conclusion either: if the blood of Christ 
serves us for righteousness, or has brought about 
righteousness for us, it follows that our works are 
nothing. These do not have the testimony of the Spirit, 
as our believers do. We, like Paul, can be challenged by 
Satan's angels, but the Word remains pure in us, so that 
we can discern it. The Spirit bears witness, first to our 
spirit within us, then also before the world, that we can 
speak. "I believe, therefore | speak," Ps. 116:10, from 
which we understand that Christ is in us. Here it does 
not depend on our intellect or power of judgment to 
recognize this, much less to confess it, but all this we 
have from the Spirit that God has given us. 


The fourth chapter. 


V. 1. Beloved, do not believe any spirit, but test the 
spirits to see if they are from God. 


There is nothing more unstable than the winds, and 
nothing more changeable than the false spirits. Now one 
perceives that the wind blows from the morning, in a 
moment it turns toward evening. Therefore it is more 
strongly spoken, "Believe not every spirit," than if he had 
said, "Believe not every doctrine. For under the pretext 
of the spirit they subordinate everything to themselves, 
and out of nonsense and out of too much abundance of 
the spirit they punish us that we make so much boast of 
the letter and of the carnal word. Therefore he 
commands the spirits to be tested, because such spirits 
come to deceive the brethren, not to teach them. But 
they can be 





test: Whoever wants to start something new or teach 
something different must be called by God and confirm 
his calling with true miracles. If he cannot do this, he 
should go his own way. 

2 Accordingly, there is a special emphasis in the 
word: "Test the spirits", because with it he hits their 
boastfulness exactly, as if he wanted to say: Such 
people will come to you who boast of the spirit; but test 
the spirits. 


For many false prophets have gone out into the 
world. 

John lived a long time and finally had to see that the 
world was filled with such evil teachings. Is it not to be 
regretted that in so short a time so many heaps of 
heresies have broken into the church? For 


1472 


Interpretation on 1 John 4, 1. 2. W. ix, ioog-1012. 


147Z 





Immediately after the word, many spirits, false apostles, 
the Ebionites, Cerinthians, Nicolaitans, and the others, 
who were forerunners of the Antichrist, entered the 
church. But these went out and were not sent. But how 
shall we test them? How shall we recognize the spirit of 
error and truth? 


V. 2. By this you shall know the Spirit of God: 
Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come 
into the flesh is from God. 


4. everything they teach, hold it against the saying: 
"Jesus Christ came into this world to save sinners", 1 
Tim. 1, 15. what agrees with this, accept that it is from 
God. But what does not agree with this, believe that it is 
from the father of lies. 

(5) First of all, the Jews constantly deny that Christ 
came in the flesh, and Cerinthus denied that Christ was 
before Mary. If he came in the flesh, it follows that he 
was before the flesh. Whoever denies that he came into 
the flesh denies that he is God and man. Therefore, he 
is not from God, but from the devil. 

6 And the spirit of the pope is of no better kind. For 
the pope confesses this word, "Christ is come in the 
flesh," but he denies its fruit. But this is as much as to 
say, Christ is not come into the flesh. For Christ's coming 
into the flesh did not happen so that he might become a 
man for his own sake, but so that he might make us 
blessed. He who teaches that he came in this way 
cancels out the fruit and power of his future. For Christ 
came to the end that he might destroy the works of the 
devil, that he might save sinners from sins. But this the 
pope denies. He keeps these very words, but otherwise 
he denies the power of his future, that is, that our heart 
should put its trust in the righteousness of Christ alone, 
and thereby become righteous. The pope condemns this 
article in his bulls, that we would be justified by the 
righteousness of Christ alone, which is the effect of his 
incarnation. But Paul contradicts this 


with clear words: "Therefore we hold that a man is 
justified without the work of the law, but only by faith", 
Rom. 3, 28. And our John: "His blood makes us clean 
from all sin", 1 Joh. 1, 7. Therefore Peter condemns 
those "who deny the Lord who bought them", 2 Petr. 2, 
1. They confess the Lord, but they deny that he bought 
them. Therefore, we conclude from this text that the spirit 
of the pope is of the devil, because he denies that Christ 
came into the flesh by denying the power and effect of 
the future of Christ. 

(7) | have also seen some spirits who confessed 
Christ by name, but in fact denied Him. For they said 
they believed in God, although not in a mediator. But | 
have nothing with God, nor can | even think of God, if | 
do not know that His Son is Christ and the mediator of 
the whole world. Therefore, we must begin with the 
future of Christ and always take refuge in Him as the 
Coming One in the causes of our salvation, so that we 
may hear His voice when He says, "Behold, | come," Ps. 
40:8. Therefore, no one remembers God without the 
Mediator. See how Philip erred in this. When he said to 
Christ, John 14:8, "Show us the Father," he answered 
him [v. 9], "Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father." 
Let us therefore persevere in accepting him as the one 
who comes into the flesh. He seeks the Lost Sheep; we, 
as the Lost Sheep, are to follow Him, as our Shepherd. 

The spirit of the sacramentarians grossly denies that 
Christ came into the flesh when they say that the flesh 
of Christ is of no use; likewise, the spirit must do 
everything, baptism is nothing. Therefore, he is not of 
God. 

(9) If you look at the papacy, you will not see why 
Christ came into the flesh; indeed, you will think it is 
something superfluous. Erasmus, when he disputes in 
an epistle why Christ came into the flesh, makes him a 
lawgiver. So do all the monks. But Christ came to save 
us from Satan, from death, and from sin, from which we 
could not be saved by our own strength. Yes, he came 
to the end.

that he would abolish all laws and abolish all 
righteousnesses, and establish his righteousness alone. 

Satan can suffer the text according to the words, but 
he tries to steal their power. The pope takes away the 
core of Christ and leaves only empty words. He leaves 
him the shell, and takes out the core. For he confesses 
Christ's righteousness, but that our righteousness is not 
abolished. And that is just as much as confessing 
nothing. We know that we have no access to God, for 
we are of the same nature as Paul says, namely, after 
we have been justified by faith, Rom. 5:1, 2: "Therefore 
having been justified by faith, we have peace with God 
through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have 
access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." Christ 
is in the flesh, but in Him is the fullness of God. God has 
presented Himself to us in Christ. 

(11) Christ came into the flesh, that he might be 
present with us in supper and holy communion. Now 
every spirit that goes to teach that Christ does all things 
through the sacraments is of God, and gladly hears of 
Christ, and gives thanks for it. For he understands that 
Christ is his, and has come into the flesh. Accordingly, 
this is spoken very emphatically. Behold, this is the test 
of every spirit, whether it is of God or of the devil. 


V. 3. And every spirit that confesseth not that 
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And 
this is the spirit of antichrist, of which ye have heard 
that it shall come, and is even now in the world. 

12 By this he means that there are many antichrists 
and false prophets who abolish the future of Christ in the 
flesh. For this alone bites Satan, that this future of Christ 
is ours in the flesh. Because Satan sees this, he sees at 
the same time that his whole kingdom, his papacy, his 
masses 2c. fall in a heap. 

No one has fulfilled the characteristics of the 
Antichrist so cunningly, so deviously, as the pope. 
Manichaeus, Marcion, Valentinus 





They were also crude when they said that the flesh of 
Christ was only a delusion, and only seemed to be flesh; 
and the enthusiasts say: Christ's flesh is of no use. But 
the spirit of Pabst is the most subtle, as he recognizes 
the future of Christ and keeps the apostolic words and 
apostolic sermons, but he has taken out the core, which 
is that he has come to save sinners. Therefore he filled 
the world with sects. He left everything for appearance, 
but in fact and truth he took everything. This requires art 
and deceit, to stain everything under the best of 
appearances, and to say that Christ suffered for us; and 
yet at the same time teach that we do enough. All other 
heretics are only anti-Christians in certain respects, but 
this one is the only and true anti-Christ, who is against 
the whole of Christ. 

(14) Therefore, we must close our eyes against all 
doctrines and remain only with the opinion and the way 
of justification through Christ. One must indeed do good 
works, but in the way that has been said above. 

15 Thus we have heard the test, which is the only 
one by which we recognize and test all spirits, namely, 
that we pay attention to whether they teach that Christ, 
the Son of God, has come into the flesh. All heretics at 
all times violate this article. Therefore, the spirit that is 
going around in the world today is trying to take away 
this test, that the flesh of Christ is useful to us. The devil 
in particular has done this when he has left the Holy 
Scriptures in the hands of the pope. Everything he 
decided in his office, we had to believe in the church. 
Similarly, what a monk dreamed in his habit had to be 
accepted and introduced into the church. Mellerstadt 
said: Let the doctores be doctores; one must not listen 
to what the holy church says, but to what the scripture 
says. But Satan is afraid of this test and judgment of the 
Spirit and the Scriptures; therefore he always suspends 
the future of Christ in the flesh, especially in severe 
temptations. If you are tempted to call upon Mary at the 
same time, then the future of Christ is not strongly 
imprinted in the flesh. 


1476 


heart, but it will soon be abolished. For if | believe that 
Christ came to save me from sins, what have | to do in 
monasteries? Why do | call upon the saints? 

16 And this is what is said here, "This is the 
Antichrist," namely, "of whom you have heard. Just as 
before the first future of Christ Elijah went before, so 
before his last future, when he will appear gloriously, the 
Antichrist will come before: "And wickedness is already 
stirring secretly", 2 Thess. 2, 7. Hereby John confirms 
what was publicly preached in the church, namely that 
the Antichrist would set up his kingdom, whose spirit he 
already sees, but the true Antichrist himself (he says) 
should still come in the future. He had already come with 
the first fruits of his spirit, but the kingdom of Pabst, 
which is nothing else but a kingdom of unrighteousness, 
grew gradually until he has risen above the kingdom of 
Christ. Today, the laws of the pope are insisted upon 
more than the laws of Christ. No priest fears the law of 
Christ as much as the law of the pope. No one has 
repented so severely for committing adultery, envy, or 


death, as if he had not waited for the horas canonicas 1). 
If they now come into a kingdom here, there is the pure 
kingdom of the Antichrist. For "he is an abominable man, 
and exalteth himself above all that is called God or God's 
service", 2 Thess. 2, 4, that is, above all God that is 
called or worshipped. Consider all who worship gods, 
even those who worship the one true God, yet you will 
not find such high worship as this to worship the pope. 
To be obedient to the pope is the highest service of God, 
as he says in a bull: And if they should fall into such great 
wickedness that, with danger to their souls, they 
refrained from obeying the pope 2c. See how great he 
makes himself, as if the contempt of God and other 
gross vices did not plunge the souls into danger.

Is it not true that so many sects and spirits are 
appearing? The Antichrist is already in the world and 
seduces the world to many sects, since ours are few, but 
theirs are many. However, he adds the consolation: 


V. 4. Little children, you are from God. 


18 In this way he distinguishes his own from the 
followers of the Counter-Christ. If you remain in this 
doctrine, that you believe that Christ came into the flesh, 
then you are of God, and walk in the world as in a battle. 
Enough that we are of God. Therefore, the spirits that 
are not of God will not harm you. 


And have overcome those. 


Nineteen: For ye are stronger than they. They are 
many, but you, though you are few, are superior to them. 
In the doctrine of Christ the inferior part always remains; 
but the apparent doctrine draws after it the learned, the 
great, the wise. Certainly, it is a powerful word that we 
find here: "You have overcome"; by this the listeners 
must necessarily be raised up. From the outward 
appearance it seems as if they were overcomers and we 
were overcomers. That is why faith is necessary here. 
For we do not overcome by force and multitude, but by 
faith and by the word. See how many heretics there are 
today. The heretics always make up a larger proportion 
than the orthodox. When the Arians began to rise, it 
seemed as if they were conquerors on all sides. 
However, even though it seemed as if the whole world 
had overcome us, and it seemed as if they had hope of 
victory, the orthodox had the true doctrine and had 
overcome, and are still overcoming today. 


For he who is in you is greater than he who is in 
the world. 


20 Although they think and conclude, "Because we 
are better, because we are more, because we are 
wiser," you are not so, you are not more learned, you are 
not more, indeed, you do not equal us in any way. But 
he who is in us is greater, richer, wiser, more splendid. 
So 


1478 


John goes so high with his wisdom, so deep he sees the 
matter. They surpass us by so many thousand times a 
thousand; it seems as if all ours turn into nothing. But do 
not compare yourselves with them, but with your Lord, 
and you will be far superior to them. The army of Israel 
was also small, a small group; and yet the king of Israel 
overcame Benhadad, 1 Kings 20:20, 21. So do not be 
afraid, you small armies; Christ is with us in small 
numbers, but the devil is with them in great numbers. 
They could easily overcome us, but they cannot 
overcome the Christ who is in us; for His sake we are 
superior to all. 

21. but no one sees it except a believer./ According 
to the judgment of the flesh, this can be seen. The 
example of Elisha is known to us, who said to his 
servant: "Fear not; for there are more of them that are 
with us than of them that are with them", 2 Kings 6:16. 
With them is an arm of flesh, but with us is the arm of 
God, the Son of God, the Strong One. 


V. 6 They are of the world, therefore they speak 
of the world, and the world hears them. 


How is it that we are not heard? The revealed truth 
has been told and made manifest to them so many 
times, and yet the world hears them. The devil's main 
purpose is to prevent them from taking a close look at 
the Scriptures and staying with them and being 
converted, and by doing so he especially strengthens 
his kingdom. How shall we be able to reign on earth, 
since our Head and all the apostles have not been able 
to reign? This is an indissoluble proof. It is certainly 
something wonderful: they are of the world, we are of 
God. Their language is the language of the world, our 
language is the language of the spirit. They speak 
nothing but what the world gives them, and as they 
speak, so they find listeners; but when we speak from 
the spirit of God, most of them snore. 

There is no heresy so tasteless that has not found its 
listeners. What could ever have been taught more 
inconsistently than that the priapum and the male 


Interpretations of the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1018-1020. 


1479 


The pagans believed that the Minerva had sprung from 
the brain of Jupiter. These things, so tasteless, were 
believed by the pagans; the whole world was attached 
to these and similar things. In short, the devil is a god of 
the world; what therefore this spirit puts forward, the 
world accepts; but he who is in us is greater than he who 
is in the world. Such is the depth of the knowledge of the 
kingdom of Christ. This is beyond our reason, how men 
have allowed themselves to be persuaded of such 
tawdry things, and so many excellent, wise men among 
the Greeks and Romans have been deceived. But what 
is it wonder? They were of the world, and not of God, 
and therefore they pursued worldly things. The 
Peripatetics said that God was asleep, not concerned 
with worldly or human things. From such teachings one 
could see the great power of Satan. Therefore, as the 
host, so the guests, and they found such listeners, who 
were of the same mind with them. But where did this 
come from? They followed reason, which is of the world, 
not of the Spirit of God. It is easy to believe that bread is 
bread, that wine is wine; it is also easy to teach the 
same. So it is also easy to believe that Christ was not 
before Mary. All such opinions are very easy, and can 
be easily persuaded, because they are according to 
reason. For the teachers themselves are of the world, 
that is, they are filled with the spirit of the world; therefore 
they also preach worldly things, therefore they also have 
worldly listeners. But we are not worldly; our preaching 
is from GOD; therefore one must keep above it. 


V.6. We are of God, and he who knows God hears 
us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we 
know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 


We are from God. 


Our doctrine is from God, therefore it overcomes the 
gates of the world and hell. This should not be 
concealed, but preached, and stopped, "whether in 
season or out of season", 2 Tim. 4:2. 


1480 


Interpretation of 1 John 4:6-8. 


1481 


W. ix, 1020-1023. 





He who is not of God does not hear us. 


Is a dilemma, and consists of these two pieces: The 
listeners are either of GOD, or of the world. Those who 
are of God hear God's word, John 8:47; those who are 
not of God do not hear God's word. Therefore, we judge 
them by what they teach and by what they hear. Either 
they teach that Christ came into the flesh, or they deny 
it; by this they must be recognized. But let no one be 
offended by the multitude. The thief on the cross saw 
himself abandoned together with Christ, but he clung to 
the word with closed eyes, and did not turn to the priests, 
nor to the whole world, nor to the cross of Christ. For 
then he said, "Lord, remember me when you come into 
your kingdom," Luc. 23:42. So we too should banish 
everything from our hearts, and believe only the word of 
God that Christ has come into the flesh, and renounce 
the world. 

We are from God. 


At the beginning, John turns to his own and 
abandons the heretics that the world hears and 
addresses the church in general, that it, having come to 
faith, should practice love toward its neighbor. "We," he 
says, in which word there is an emphasis, so that he 
wants to indicate the certainty of regeneration. "Are of 
GOD." In this also there is an emphasis. They are of 
Satan, therefore they do not love us, for love is of GOD/ 
If we humbled ourselves before them, we would achieve 
nothing with it. "When a wise man comes to deal with a 
fool, he is angry or laughs, he has no peace," says 
Solomon, Proverbs 29:9. And Christ himself says: "To 
whom shall | compare this generation? It is like the little 
children who sit in the marketplace and cry out against 
their companions, saying: We whistled to you, and you 
would not dance; we mourned to you, and you would not 
weep,” Matt. 11:16, 17. Now he comes again to the 
heretics, and marks them with an unmistakable sign: 


He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God 
does not hear us. 


27. when one hears God's true messengers, that is a 
manifest characteristic of the 





true religion; but if one despises and rejects it, that is a 
manifest sign of error. Therefore he adds, "By this we 
know the spirit of truth and error." 


V. 7. Beloved, let us love one another; for love is 
of God; and he that loveth is born of God, and 
knoweth God. 


The text is easy; let us only see against whom he 
writes here. The first characteristic he took from hearing 
and from the contempt of the word, which is very clear; 
the other he takes from love and from hatred of one's 
neighbor, which is sometimes covered with hypocrisy. 
Meanwhile the sentence is true in and of itself: "Every 
one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." And 
thus also in the opposite: Whoever does not love, but 
hates, is not born of God, nor does he know Him. 


And know God. 


29 Namely, with true knowledge. For true knowledge 
is opposed by two different kinds that deceive. The first 
is when people imagine that God is angry with us. They 
may look for God wherever they want, but they will not 
find Him. This is a false knowledge and despair. The 
other is a haughty conceit that | have of myself, when | 
imagine that God is gracious to me for the sake of my 
works and deeds. Accordingly, "to know God" is as 
much as to believe, to fear God, to avoid sin, in which 
God has great abhorrence, but in such a way that one 
does not despair. If the law brings you low, do not 
despair: God has looked upon you, and you look upon 
Him again, namely, His mercy. "God resists the proud, 
but gives grace to the humble," Jac. 4, 6. 1 Petr. 5, 5. 
"The Lord is well pleased with those who fear Him," Ps. 
147, 11. 


V. 8. He who does not love does not know God. 
(30) Here you have the mark that is contrary to a 
Christian man. 1) 


1) The meaning of this sentence will be: This is the mark by which 
you can recognize a person who is the opposite of a Christian. 


1482 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1023-1026. 


1483 





For God is love. 


(31) Those who are attacked with this saying do not 
believe this. For they think they are humble people who 
practice love diligently, and yet they are full of hatred, of 
which Paul often speaks, which one can look up [in his 
epistles]. For "to know GOD" is as much as to know His 
love at the same time. God, after He has been 
reconciled through Christ, loves us and is completely 
pure love, just as He was completely pure anger toward 
us before our reconciliation. For this he also wants to be 
recognized by us, not as an angry judge, but as a 
reconciled father. Whoever does not know that he has a 
gracious father in him does not know God. 


V. 9. In this the love of God toward us appeared, 
that God sent His only begotten Son. 


(32) Hereby he proves that God not only loves, but is 

love itself; as if to say: If you knew that God is love, you 
would also know that He sent His only begotten Son, 
that He poured Himself out completely for us, and that 
He gave His own to us. This is a precious word, as Paul 
says: "This is a precious word," which is worthy of 
acceptance, "that Jesus Christ came into the world to 
save sinners," 1 Tim. 1:15. These words of ours have 
much behind them, and are full of emphasis. We are sin 
and death, but through Him, the Son, we live and are 
righteous. 
If all things are through him, it follows that they are not 
through us. This is contrary to free will. Through him, 
Christ, are all things; through us is nothing. This rule of 
the apostle surpasses that of Augustine, Benedicti, and 
others in their rules; indeed, it is always contrary to their 
rules. For if we have life and salvation through Christ 
alone, it follows that we do not have it through our works 
and deeds, whatever they may be. Just as Cain and 
Abel were not regarded in the same way by God, not 
because of their works, which were good in both cases, 
but because of their persons. Abel's heart and person 
were better than Cain's, because he believed the 
promise his mother had made to him. 


"He will crush the head of the serpent", Gen. 3, 15; he 
was attached to it, but Cain dealt with works. But this is 
vain talk, which Josephus 1) pretends, that Cain is said 
to have sacrificed small fruits, and because of that he 
was looked upon ungraciously by God. Therefore he 
does not look at us, because we also do not look at his 
only begotten son. And there is an emphasis in the fact 
that he does not say his son alone, but "his only 
begotten son", that God sent his only begotten son. 


Into the world that we should live through him. 


Again, it is said with emphasis: "Into the world", 
because in the world are the kingdoms of the devil, by 
which the elect are oppressed. Behold the inestimable 
love of God, and show me a religion which can exhibit a 
like mystery. Therefore let us take hold of Christ, who 
was given for us, and of his righteousness; but let us 
regard our righteousness as dung, that we, having died 
to sin, may live unto God alone. 


V. 10. In this is love, not that we have loved God. 


(35) This is an explanation of the previous words, as 
if to say, But this is love, "not that we loved before. But 
see how diligently the apostles take pains to beat down 


our merits and works. Nevertheless, in libro tertio 


sententiarum it is disputed whether the holy fathers 
deserved the incarnation of Christ? But the matter has 
good ways. God promised it by grace and freely, out of 
love he gave everything for free that he ever showed to 
the fathers and prophets. For so much is lacking that we 
should have earned something, that we also hated GOD 
before. For all our efforts and works, especially those by 
which we strive to earn His grace, are unjust and void. 


But that he first loved us. 


36. every word condemns our works, and yet we do 
not see it, but run. 


1) Josephus, antiqu., lib. 1, cap. 2. 


1484 Interpretation on 1 John 4, 10. 11. W. ix, 1026-1028. 1485 





about it. So also the moral works and the de congruo are 
a vain babble. For my works are not equal to the works 
of Christ, nor of the same power as Christ's works, which 
alone is our propitiation. But now they say that we must 
be sufficient for venial sins, not for mortal sins. But let 
them keep their vain talk to themselves; let us leave this 
glory to Christ alone. 


And sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sin. 


The whole world seeks to be reconciled with God, so 

one has always devised other ways of reconciliation 
than the other. But to us, God has given His Son for our 
reconciliation. Whoever does not believe this will have 
to despair, and this, | fear, will happen to our monks, 
even to those who appear to be the most holy. For we 
see that their sects are only sects of perdition, who by 
their vows and holiness want to make themselves a 
gracious God. Christ's works, and Christ himself, are far 
more excellent than our works, in which we have lived 
for forty years and accomplished nothing. This single 
article, that God sent His only begotten Son into the 
world, is the only thing He wants us to do, and that we 
live through Christ alone. This article Satan seeks to rob 
us of; in this article the monks have erred, and where 
they have not repented, they have been condemned, as 
Wiklef said. | wonder that he saw this in his time. The 
orders put the hope of salvation on the ceremonies, 
therefore they deny Christ, in whom alone is 
reconciliation and life. Either Christ has erred, or they 
have erred. 
38 This must be impressed upon the people, because 
the devil is most disgusted with this article. What is 
written in the Gospel has been fulfilled in us: "Many will 
come in my name, saying, '| am Christ," Luc. 21:8. 
Those who place the hope of salvation in works and 
ceremonies worship the devil in fact and in truth. That is 
why they had enough money. For what do the monks 
lack in 


Pabstthum? When the devil wants to deceive, he 
disguises himself into an angel of light. As an example, 
when he wanted to deceive Martinum, he appeared in a 
golden crown, but he answered him: "My Lord did not 
say that he would come in such jewelry. Another brother 
said to an angel of the same kind, "My dear angel, see 
that you do not arrive unjustly. For | am not worthy that 
an angel should be sent to me from heaven. So Satan 
goes about seeking in every way that he may make us 
foolish, and thereupon devour us. We are to fall down 
before Christ our Reconciler, that is, to worship God, so 
that we may confess that we are truly sinners and hope 
for good from God. Make for yourselves spiritual armor 
from the Scriptures, from the justification that comes 
through faith. Get together, | say, some scriptures that 
ascribe righteousness to God. If you rely on them, then 
you will be able to stand, even though you have fallen 
after committing fornication, death and other sins. If 
Christ, the Son of God, is our propitiation, it follows that 
it is not the works of the monks. Therefore, St. Bernard 
did very well, who repented and said: | have lived evil. 


V. 11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought 
to love one another. 


This is an admonition that flows from the previous 
passage. This is found constantly in John, that he 
comes from faith to the love of his neighbor, and from 
there goes back to faith again, and proves it from this 
fruit. Others may do what they want, we should love one 
another. The neighbor is not served by the works of the 
monks. We derive the greatest joy from the fact that we 
have people whom we can love, be it our wives or 
children, and thank God for giving us such persons in 
whom we can exercise our love. The monks leave them, 
and for this reason they have gone to the monasteries, 
so that there they may make our souls blessed; in the 
meantime, they have taken care of our neighbors, who 
may also be blessed.

They are not concerned about being whoever they want 
to be. So they do not learn and teach in the monastic 
state, but serve only themselves. Accordingly, we should 
be grateful after we have recognized this light. | would 
rather be condemned by Pope Gregory and the other 
teachers than by Christ himself. Therefore, let us work to 
keep this pure teaching with us. 


V. 12. No one has ever seen God. 


With this few words | can throw all orders to the 
ground. He who has not seen God cannot teach anything 
else. 1) He means to say: There are many who boast that 
they have seen God and teach the truth. But beware of 
this. "No one has ever seen God. Only the only begotten 
Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared it 
to us," John 1:18. He alone must be heard, and those 
whom he has sent, namely the holy apostles. "He that 
heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you 
despiseth me," Luc. 10:16. This doctrine has been 
confirmed with miracles and signs from heaven. If they 
now say that they spoke by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, 
please ask them to prove it with true miracles and not 
fictitious ones. True miracles are. Raising the dead, 
giving sight to the blind 2c. Accordingly, we should say 
to the fathers who preach new rules and doctrines that 
they speak from ignorance. 

Therefore, let us take care to keep this in mind. If the 
devil, even with secret thoughts, comes to deceive us in 
the most phenomenal way, let us hold this saying against 
him first of all when it comes to the teaching. 

But why did God give the devil such great power? For 
this reason, so that the power, majesty and strength of 
this word, "no one has ever seen God," may be revealed. 
Paul also speaks of this: "God, the Blessed and only 
Mighty, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone 
has immortality, who dwells in a light where no one has 
ever seen". 


1) The meaning of this sentence is probably the same as in the last 
sentence of this paragraph. 


whom no man hath seen, neither can see," 1 Tim. 6, 15. 
16. Likewise 1 Tim. 1, 7: "Teachers, who desire to be 
masters of the Scriptures, and understand not what they 
say, or what they set." And to Colossians 2, 18: "Let no 
man shift his aim, who walketh after his own choice in 
the humility and spirituality of angels, having never seen 
any; and is puffed up without matter in his carnal mind, 
and continueth not in the head.” 


If we love one another, God remains in us. 


This loving is an outward work, but it gives us 
testimony that God is in us. 


And His love is completely within us. 


44 But so that it can still be increased, as Paul says: 
"Grow in the knowledge of God", Col. 1, 11. Likewise, 
Paul did not think that he had already grasped perfect 
love. 

(45) | believe it to be a pure, sincere, blameless love, 
a right love, which is opposed to hypocrisy. And the 
saints are also sincere in their ways and conduct. This 
love is opposed to the hypocritical one, in which we have 
been diligent until now. It seems that he wants to say 
this much: The Christians’ love is thorough, not 
fabricated and pretended. Augustine says of the 
Manichaeans that they had a disguised love, which 
could actually be called a monastic love. 


V. 13. By this we know that we abide in him, and 
he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit. 


This is the pledge and testimony that God abides in 
us. But the Holy Spirit is given in a twofold way. First in 
a hidden way, then in a revealed way, in which way it 
was given to Cornelius and Apollo (which can be read 
about in the Acts of the Apostles in the 10th, 18th, 19th 
chapters), when they so diligently investigated. And so 
the saints all feel with one another the firstfruits of it. For 
they rejoice, and have both good thoughts and words of 
Christ, and delight in him, and love him. The

Word is a joy to them, which is not without the Holy Spirit. 
Therefore, every Christian has the Holy Spirit, no matter 
how much or how little. That he is afraid of death, that he 
feels restlessness, this he gets from the flesh. But that he 
is made a partaker of peace and rest does not grow in 
us. Loving Christ, confessing Christ, and feeling sweet 
pleasure in him does not happen without the Holy Spirit. 
To confess the faith, to bear the hatred of the world, to 
endure exile and death, these are all testimonies of the 
Spirit. 
V. 14. And we have seen and testify. 


47 This he speaks both of himself and of the other 
apostles who have seen Christ. 


That the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the 
world. 


Consequently, the whole world was damned before. 
All the actions of all men, even the powers of free will, 
were nothing. That is why Christ came to save sinners. 


V. 15. Who then confesses. 


The apostle's greatest concern was to preserve the 
pure doctrine. 


That JEsus is the Son of GOD, in him abides GOD, 
and he in GOD. 


50 He speaks mainly against the Cerinthians and 
Ebionites. But what shall we say of our heretics and 
hypocrites, who have nothing meaner and more common 
in their mouths than: JEsus Christ, Son of God. It is not 
enough to say this with the mouth, but the spirit is 
required. "No one can call Jesus Lord without the Holy 
Spirit," 1 Cor. 12:3. Whether they say it with their mouth, 
itis a curse in their heart. For they confess that they know 
God, but in fact they deny it, "and deny the Lord who 
bought them," 2 Pet. 2:1, saying that they are Christians, 
but ascribing righteousness and salvation to their works 
and selling them to others. They deny the whole of Christ, 
and the we 





The first step is to make them righteous and blessed, 
and to teach them how to do it themselves. 

(51) In the same way, the spiritualists who deny the 
body and blood of Christ, and believe what they like in 
the Holy Communion, but reject what they do not like, do 
the same. Therefore they call the Lord Jesus a curse. 
For he must be confessed in all deeds and words as the 
only Savior. Whoever denies Christ in one article must 
necessarily deny him everywhere. He who denies one 
article is a denier of Christ. Therefore, it is something 
else to err, and something else to stubbornly rely on it 
and deny it. Augustine says: "| would like to be able to 
err, but | do not want to be a heretic and stubbornly 
persist in error. Our red spirits persist badly in their vain 
opinions. We can err because of the flesh we wear, but 
in spirit we must see to it that we do not persist in error 
after we have recognized it. 

Therefore, the holy fathers, who were also human 
beings, must be read with deliberation, where they follow 
their own reason. We know whom to follow. When our 
papists read Augustine, who attributes everything to 
grace, they say that he went too far in speaking, so that 
Augustine has not been accepted by the Roman Church 
to this day. One must see everywhere with the teachers 
how much they have of the flesh and how much they 
have of the spirit. Spirit is when we sincerely confess 
Christ as the only Savior; not only in bits and pieces, but 
completely, and everywhere; not only with the mouth, 
but also with the heart itself. But where they waver, this 
is not from the Spirit of God, but is an effect of the flesh. 


V. 16: And we have known and believed the love 
that God has for us. 


It is impossible that a heart, if it only truly knows 
Christ and the love of God, should not acquire a sweet 
inclination toward Him. It is also driven and drawn to love 
its neighbor. Just think what an important and great thing 
this is. 


1490 


Be that Christ does not spare Himself. He dies that | may 
live forever. He did not give a thousand pounds for us, 
but his life. Through the love of God and Christ we come 
to love God the Father and our neighbor. We do not see 
God, but we believe in Him and love Him; and as much 
as you do not trust Him, so much do you not love Him. 
There is no faith among our papists and the spirits of the 
rot, therefore there is no love among them either. 
Therefore they hate us and want to harm us. But we love 
God, whom the world does not love. 


God is the song, and he who suffers in the song 
suffers in God, and God in him. 


Yes, God is nothing other than love. For even though 
he is goodness, all his goods flow from love. These 
words are of great emphasis, and they are believed by 
few, yes, by very few. We generally look upon God as a 
judge with sad and hard hearts. Therefore, he is blessed 
who has this knowledge that God is love. For although 
the words are short, they have a very deep 
understanding. For the flesh is weak, and very thick 
clouds always hover before its eyes. Our flesh cannot 
imagine Christ in any other way than as an angry judge. 
Therefore, a monk comes with his masses and either 
becomes arrogant or despairs at the amount of his 
works. The flesh cannot rise to the heights. God loves, 
not for the sake of our works, but for the sake of His love. 
Therefore we must contend, that we may overcome and 
say, "I will not die, but live," Ps. 118:17. So much for the 
testimony and mark of the spirit. He who has a true 
knowledge of God abides in him. 


GOd is the song. 


These are simple words, but they require the highest 
faith, against which everything that is not of the spirit of 
God disputes. Conscience, the devil, hell, the judgment 
of God, and all these things argue against the fact that 
we should not believe that God is love, but that we 
should believe that God is a peacock. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1034-1036. 





1491 


niger and judge. Through the world | also understand the 
adversaries of the word and the sects. Accordingly, it is 
taught here as a short summary that one must keep faith 
against these attacks. Accordingly, he who has a true 
knowledge of God remains in Christ, and God in him. 


V. 17. In this love is fully with us, that we may have 
joy in the day of judgment. 

For this love of God is so great that we can have joy 
in the day of judgment, when the whole world will 
tremble. "Behold, | lay in Zion a foundation stone, a tried 
stone, a precious cornerstone, well established. He who 
believes does not flinch," Isa. 28:16. Consequently, 
through the knowledge of such love we also have faith 
that we can stand in judgment. Christ reminds us of this 
in the parable of the fig tree: "Then they will see the Son 
of Man coming in the clouds with power and great glory. 
But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, 
and lift up your heads, because your redemption draweth 
nigh. And he told them the same thing: "Look at the fig 
tree and all the trees. When they now shoot forth, ye see 
it in them, and know that summer is now at hand. So also 
you, when you see these things coming, know that the 
kingdom of God is near," Luc. 21:27 ff. This is what the 
blood of love shed for us does, which is far more precious 
than all the merits and deaths of all the saints. 

The fact that we do not think of this in terms of dignity, 
and do not handle this blood with dignity enough, is due 
to our upbringing, since we have been educated from our 
childhood in human statutes and inventions in so many 
different ways. The devil knows this weakness of our 
flesh, that we do not highly esteem the blood of Christ 
according to dignity. Therefore, when your conscience 
weighs you down because of a great sin, console 
yourself with this blood of love. 

Truly, the whole world does not grasp the slightest 
syllable of this saying: "God is love. No single human 
religion can stand before the court but 


1492 


Interpretation on 1 John 4, 17. 18. W. ix, 


1493 





In the blood of Christ alone we have joy on the day of 
judgment. 


For as he is, so are we in this world. 


(59) This is against the enthusiasts who say that 
Christ is a spirit. But they understand such a spirit, which 
has not flesh and blood. But these John refutes: "For as 
we are in the world, even so was he also in the world." 
We are surrounded with all evils in this life, so he was 
also surrounded with them. But in Christ we have him 
who redeems us from all these evils. This life is the 
epitome of all evils. But the flesh does not allow us to 
consider them. For we see that this one falls into 
manslaughter, that one into adultery, another into theft. 
2c. If we consider this, we would also consider the 
preciousness of the blood of Christ, which makes it so 
that we may not tremble before the judgment of God, nor 
fear the wrath of God and death. 

(60) They make Christ a spirit without flesh and 
blood, so that they may belittle the value of the blood. 
But the flesh and blood of Christ are still useful to us. For 
Christ is with us in spirit, that is, he has a spiritual body. 
For his flesh is no longer natural, he no longer has the 
bodily passions, he does not eat, he does not sleep, but 
he is spiritual, as Paul says: "A natural body is sown, 
and a spiritual body is raised," 1 Cor. 15:44. We who live 
have mortal and corruptible passions. Christ does not 
have such a body, nor will we have such a body in the 
future, but a spiritual body, that is, an incorruptible body 
that does not need food or drink or clothing. This is our 


Joy. 


V. 18. Fear is not in love, but complete love casts 
out fear. For fear has torment. But he who fears is 
not complete in love. 

61. He makes a difference among Christians. Some 
have fear and terror; they lack love. Others, however, 
have fear, but not terror; in these is the love. 





Love completely. For he speaks of such fear, which is 
otherwise also called terror, and which makes man 
unskilled to believe. Let every man make a trial of his 
faith. If he believes in Christ, he has love. The stronger 
he believes, the less trembling there is; the weaker he 
believes, the more he trembles. But some apostles, 
including Paul, had fear, as he writes of himself 2 Cor. 
7:5: "When we came into Macedoniam, our flesh had no 
rest, but everywhere we were in tribulation, struggling 
outwardly, fearing inwardly." All the saints feared death, 
whereas Paul was joyful in tribulations. 

Christians have two times, the time of war and the 
time of peace. At the time of war, a Christian is very 
different than at the time of peace. For by the time of 
peace | mean when he is not tempted in faith, when 
there is peace between God and conscience, of which 
Paul speaks: "We are at peace with God," Rom. 5:1. The 
time of war is when a temptation of faith overtakes us; 
there it is difficult to be joyful in tribulations, just as Christ 
was not joyful. For the devil sometimes challenges our 
joyfulness and takes away peace. This happened to Job 
and to Paul, so he says: "Inwardly there was fear in him, 
outwardly there was strife. John speaks of this time of 
war. For what one fears, one hates. He who is afraid of 
God is afraid of him as of a judge; yes, he even hates 
God, because he would rather that he did not judge, that 
he did not condemn. 

But he is talking here about the false and true 
Christians. The hypocrites have neither joy nor love. The 
true Christians have love, and they have it from joyful 
confidence. For what | love, | do not flee from. If | love 
God, | do not flee from Him, but | come to Him as to a 
father. As in war these affections are mixed with each 
other, so trembling fights with love, unbelief with faith; 
yes, it sometimes seems as if unbelief has the victory. 
But God supports this weakness, just as He did with 


1494 


Christ, who in the midst of the temptation nevertheless 
completely overcame it when he said Matth. 27, 46: "My 
God, my God! What a great joy was this: "Not as | will, 
but as you will", Matth. 26, 39. Consequently he put his 
trust in the will of God. 


Complete love casts out fear. 


Love also has fear, but this love is not healthy, not 
pure, not complete, but "complete love casts out fear. 
For the complete or louder love arises from the 
confidence that God constantly grasps. 


For fear has torment. 


65: The trembling is an epitome of the punishments 
of hell. "| said in my trembling, | am cast out of thine 


eyes," Ps. 31:23. In my trembling, in excessu mentis 


meae (in &yotda61), by this David indicates. 

a hurrying away, because he despaired, that is, 
hesitated. A hesitant haste is when one fears that death 
and hell are ahead of him. But such hesitations are not 
to be rejected. The war of hesitation also attacks the 
holy of holies. Others call this temptation the spirit of 
blasphemy, or the restraint of grace. . 

(66) John is talking about careless Christians who do 
not care about love, who are afraid of death and 
judgment, and who do not care to persevere in the faith. 
It is impossible where there is true faith that there should 
not also be peace and joy. Joy in tribulations must 
necessarily follow from faith. Accordingly, those who, 
when seized, leave their wives, or recant their faith, or 
return to the monastery, do not have true faith. 


V. 19. Let us love him, for he first loved us. 


In sum, let us love God, let us show the love of God to 
our hearts.

place. If we believe that Christ is the Son of God who 
was given for us, our hearts will be kindled to love Him. 


V. 20. If anyone says, I love God, and hates his 
brother, he is a liar. 


68 Note that the apostles considered this a 
necessary thing, that it should always be inculcated, 
because many boast of love. 


For whoever does not love his brother whom he 
sees, how can he love God whom he does not see? 


This is a beautiful reason why he calls everyone who 
is to be loved "a brother. For a Christian loves his 
neighbor as a brother; he makes no distinction among 
persons or things. He does not think whether he is 
serviceable or not, whether he is wise or unwise. 
Otherwise, the world loves in a completely different way, 
according to the verse: 


Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat. 


That is, the common people keep friendship only with 
those people from whom they get pleasure. No one 
wants to deal with the deaf, the weak, the unlearned, the 
ungrateful. Christ loved all without distinction, even his 
enemies. Therefore, we should love even those who are 
not kind as brothers. 


V. 21. And this commandment have we from him, 
that he that loveth God love his brother also. 


He teaches about faith and love, because he sees 
that these two articles are particularly contested by 
Satan. For this reason, he most strongly inculcates what 
must be inculcated at all times, and repeats so often 
what he had already said once. For this rhymes well with 
John's way of writing, that he repeats two or three times 
that which is wholesome, namely, that we should be 
pure and sincere in faith and love.

The fifth chapter. 


V. 1. He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ is 
born of God: and he that loveth him that is born of 
him loveth him also that is born of him. 


Here you see that the apostle constantly repeats faith 
and love. For he saw from urgent need that the time 
would come when some of the Christians would become 
lukewarm, and others would come to vain doctrines. As 
long as these two things, faith and love, remain 
unharmed, Satan is overcome; but when they are gone, 
Satan overcomes. 


That Jesus be the Christ, who is born of God. 


2 Because the heretics are of many kinds, he meets 
them in many ways. Especially does this passage 
contend against the Jews, who are still waiting for the 
future of Christ, and deny that Christ has come. The 
Montani and others also denied that we had not received 
the Holy Spirit at all, or that we had received only the 
firstfruits of the Spirit, but that they had received the 
fullness of it. Thus those who boast of the fullness of the 
Spirit always teach worse things than those of whom 
they deny that they have the fullness of the Spirit. Thus 
the Montani, as well as the Papists, often say that they 
have received the fullness of the Spirit. Therefore they 
use the saying Joh. 16, 12: "I still have much to say to 
you. However, the Savior referred his disciples with 
these words to the complete outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, and this already happened on the first Pentecost. 

(3) Such are also our sacramentarians, who teach 
that the bread in Holy Communion is bad bread. They 
consider this to be a wiser statement than what the 
anointing of the apostles taught, that under the bread is 
the body, and under the wine the blood of Christ. They 
also boast that they know the secrets and hidden things, 
namely, what is the tabernacle of Moses, what is the high 
priestly garment of Aaron. This, they say, 


was not fulfilled in the apostles, nor was it discovered to 
them. They think that the Holy Spirit was only partially 
revealed, but not yet completely; but these things were 
revealed to them, and their spirit is far more excellent 
than the spirit of the Wittenbergs. 

(4) But we answer that our blessedness does not lie 
in these things, whether we know them or not. But of the 
things which are revealed, and wherein the summa of 
Christianity is founded, they know nothing, which their 
books testify. They cannot treat the necessary passages 
of faith and love. Therefore Christ speaks and testifies in 
clear words that everything necessary for salvation has 
been revealed to us. For this is how he addresses his 
disciples, John 15:26: "The same Spirit will testify of me." 
. Joh. 16, 13: "He will guide you into all truth." Same Cap. 
15, 15: "All things that | have heard from my Father | 
have made known to you." And Paul: "You know how | 
have not taught you anything that is useful, which | have 
not preached to you, and taught you publicly and 
specially. | have done nothing to you that | have not 
proclaimed all the counsel of God," Acts 20:20, 27. 20, 
20. 27. By which he also testifies that all Scripture is 
fulfilled. What was lacking in those days is still lacking in 
our day, who pretend that not all Scripture has been 
revealed. Of what sort is Carlstadt, who says that it is not 
yet revealed what the high priestly garment is. So he is 
engaged in useless washing, and does not know the 
summa of Christianity from faith and love. One must be 
careful of the devil with his spirits, whose rest is to 
possess a man in blindness. He, as the one who sins 
from the beginning, does a work either of falsehood or of 
death. By the one he takes away faith, by the other love. 
Meanwhile, where he is resisted for the truth of the 
teaching, he does not rest. But where he finds an empty 
house, 


1498 


which is not occupied with the preservation of the divine 
word, he does not rest until he has overcome it. Then he 
rests again. 


And whosoever loveth him that begat him loveth 
him also that is born of him. 


5 He speaks of Christ beforehand with other words, 
which nevertheless amount to the same thing, in order 
to argue against those who say: We seek only the glory 
of God, as the Arians preach. For it is impossible for you 
to love the Father, if you do not also love the Son, whom 
He begat from eternity. "He that denieth the Son hath not 
the Father," 1 John 2:23. So also the Jews do not honor 
the Father, because they deny Christ and do not honor 
Him. So also nowadays the Christians say: We seek the 
glory of God, you are liars. What is seeking the glory of 
God? They answer: Christ is seated at the right hand of 
the Father, so that he may not be in bread. But this is to 
set up the glory of God according to human will. Is this 
not also the glory of God, that Christ hung on the cross 
and endured death for us? Rom. 5:8: "Therefore praise 
God for His love toward us, that while we were yet 
sinners, Christ died for us." Is not God's glory 
transfigured by the fact that He has begotten a Son of 
equal majesty and glory, who is with us always, even to 
the end of the world? Matth. 28, 20. 


V. 2. By this we know that we love God's children 
when we love God and keep His commandments. 


6 Hereby he makes a difference between heretics 
and Christians. They do not love God because they do 
not recognize Christ, nor do they have His 
commandments because they do not believe in Him, for 
"have had God's commandments" in John is as much as 
believe. But he understands the commandments of the 
Gospel, which are not difficult. But Christians love God 
and all these commandments. This he says in order to 
shame those who presume this birth, and falsely, to 
themselves, in order thereby both to fortify our heart and 
to build up our confidence. So if | am minded, if | do not 
curse anyone, if | do not hate anyone.

Rather, to have compassion for the afflicted and needy 
is the testimony of our conscience that we are God's 
children. 


V. 3. For this is the love of God, that we keep His 
commandments. 


7 This is that we believe in Christ Jesus and love our 
neighbor. He who feels this can comfort himself and has 
a good testimony. If you love Christ, you will put your 
trust in no other thing than the merits of Christ. But the 
devil seeks to rob you of this. | can certainly feel whether 
| am suffering, whether | have anger in my heart, but in 
the state of temptation this certainty wavers; but 
confidence in Christ alone cannot be robbed. He is a 
rock; whoever stands on it will not be put to shame. 


And his commandments are not difficult. 


This passage has given rise to many wars in 
universities. For they have disputed whether Moses 
gave a difficult law. But as far as the law is concerned, 
both parts are of the same severity. Moses gave the law, 
but Christ explained it, freed it from false interpretations, 
and fulfilled it through his obedience. The severity of the 
law was so great that it brought Christ to the cross. But 
here he speaks of the New Testament, and understands 
the commandments of the Gospel, which are not difficult. 
Therefore Christ says: "Come unto me, all ye that labor 
and are heavy laden, and | will give you rest. For my 
yoke is easy and my burden is light," Matth. 11, 28. Why 
light? Because you accept Christ, that is, the Lamb who 
bears the sin of the world, in faith. To have Christ is as 
much as to have the Lamb who bears our sins, who 
pours out the Holy Spirit to refresh and comfort them. 
Therefore let us look to Christ and believe in Him. All this 
is in this word "believe". To believe is to cling to Christ 
with all one's heart and not to doubt. 

(9) Our enthusiasts do not, therefore they do not have 
faith. Yes, in our time there are some men, not bad men 
at all, who are beginning to doubt whether Jesus 


1500 


Interpretation on 1 John 5, 3. 4. W. ix, i048-iosi. 1501 





who is the Christian? So also the Turks, the hypocrites, 
with their various thoughts, have lost Christ, whom they 
honored as the greatest prophet after Mahomet. For 
they have a faith composed of Ebionites and Arians. 
They keep the Old Testament, and the New in bits and 
pieces; they remain with the splendor of Mahomet, and 
with his prophecies as well as those of all his prophets 
(of which they have many). But this faith has been 
destroyed by the devil. Therefore we must be most 
diligent not to lose Christ, in whom we have all things at 
once, "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and 
knowledge,” Col. 2:3. "In him dwelleth all the fullness of 
the Godhead bodily," v. 9. He that loveth the Son loveth 
also the Father. What one does to the Father, one does 
also to the Son; for they are one. 

(10) But the heretics say that they seek the glory of 
God above all, and always use this as a pretext, saying 
that they love God, before whom they are afraid, 
because they deny Christ, who reconciled us to God. 
For whoever does not believe in the Son even in one 
single point, certainly dishonors the Father and the Son 
in the same point and everywhere. Manichaeus said that 
he sought the glory of God by pretending that it was 
indecent to God that he suffered on the cross, and did 
not admit the commandment of love (against his son). 
But he was just one of the number of those who deny 
that the Son of God came into the flesh and who hate 
the brethren. | believe nothing else than that Jesus is the 
Christ, and | do not hate my brother, but love him with 
sincere love. Therefore, | have the mark in myself that | 
love God. 

(11) But against this confidence the devil sets 
himself on high, and is not so angry with any thing as 
with this gift that is in us. But one must not argue with 
him, but rather say: Go, seize yourself, as Christ did, 
Matth. 4, 10: "Lift yourself up from me, Satan," and 
overcome him with the Scriptures, not with reason. You 
must take refuge in the name of the Lord, since it is a 
strong tower, as Solomon says, Proverbs 18:10: "The 
name of the Lord is a strong tower. 





of the LORD is a stronghold; the righteous runneth 
thither, and is protected." 

12 Muenzer was not satisfied with this; he wanted a 
living voice to speak to him from heaven. But with this 
he rejected the anointing which teaches everything, and 
did not know the curse which Paul spoke against the 
new revelations: "But if we, or an angel from heaven, 
preach any other gospel to you than that which we have 
preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have now 
said, so say we again, If any man preach any other 
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be 
accursed," Gal. 1:8, 9. "All scripture, inspired of God, is 
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for 
chastening.for correction, for chastening — in 
righteousness, that a man of God may be perfect, fitted 
unto all good works," 2 Tim. 3:16, and Rom. 15:4: "That 
which is written aforetime is written for our learning, that 
we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might 
have hope." 


V. 4. For everything that is born of God overcomes 
the world. 


Here the dispute against the doctrine is described. 
For the doctrine that is of God is not without persecution, 
as is the doctrine that is of men; as we have seen so 
clearly in the case of the pope, the universities and our 
religionists 1). For though they have had wars at times, 
either with the Turks or among themselves, it has been 
for the sake of temporal goods; but for the sake of their 
doctrine they have never suffered anything within a 
thousand years. We have to contend, not with a prince 
or emperor, but with the whole race. The devil has 
spiritual weapons everywhere, with which he attacks the 
ministers of the Word on the right and on the left. That 
is why we now have so many adversaries, not only the 
enthusiasts, but also the princes, the popes, the kings 
of the world, with all their followers. Who will overcome 
them all? John says: "He who is born of God." This must 
be done through faith in Christ, which is the victory. For 
what could this wicked, fragile vessel do against the 


1) Religious monks. 


1502 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, rosi-uw. 1503 





Satan, the god of the world? But God is greater, who 
always triumphs in us through Christ. Therefore, all the 
glory of victory must be attributed to God Himself, but 
not to us in the least. We are much too small for that. For 
this, however, the word of God is required, which 
promises and offers His grace to the faithful, so that 
when they are thrown into so many and so great 
temptations, and are pressed by so great and so 
cunning spirits, they will still finally wriggle out and 
triumph. 

14. but to be born of God is as much as to believe in 
Jesus Christ. He who believes in Christ is then a true 
fighter. He overcomes, John says, as of a present thing, 
not: he has overcome. For we are still really contending 
and in the process of overcoming. Therefore we are also 
reminded and encouraged daily by Christ: Be strong in 
the Lord, and fight with the old serpent. The old serpent 
is the one who introduces lies, heresies and all evils, 
even those we see now. It has done so from the 
beginning. God has placed us in the midst of wolves, in 
the realm of the devil; for this purpose he has given us 
weapons, namely his word and spirit, and commands us 
to fight; he himself wants to be a spectator and also a 
conqueror; therefore, since he himself is our leader, we 
should hold our ground bravely, as befits good fighters. 


And our faith is the victory that overcame the bet. 


(15) These are our noblest weapons, not to wear this 
or that garment, to abstain from certain foods, to fast 
often, and to hurt the body; although Jerome and 
Erasmus advise these things almost as the noblest, and 
pass over faith, which is the most important thing in this 
victory. How well Jerome fared with this victory is 
attested by his life, when, after fasting for two or four 
days, he almost came to his senses and imagined that 
he was dancing among the young girls of Rome. 
However, experience itself teaches us that after fasting, 
defilement usually occurs, and long abstinence is 
followed by senseless lust. 


(16) However, we do not want to give rise to 
intemperance in eating and drinking, or to praise it, so that 
we should even give up temperance and fasting, but | say 
this much with the apostle John, that here not 
temperance, but faith is the victory, so that we overcome 
all evil and the whole world. However, no one can 
meditate on the word of God with benefit unless he is 
sober; a glutton and a drunkard is neither fit for faith nor 
for overcoming. The temptations are therefore many. One 
cannot believe that the soul is immortal; another cannot 
believe that Jesus is the Son of God; the third that there 
is a God who wants to be merciful. With what temptation 
the devil also challenged Christ, saying to him: "If you are 
the Son of God, let yourself go down. For it is written: He 
will command his angels over you, and they will carry you 
on their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against 
a stone", Matth. 4, 6. At that time Christ was in the highest 
temptation, so that he did not believe that God would help 
him in the same distress. So these are the highest 
temptations, mistrust or despair. And such kinds should 
be called sufferings, not temptations. Let thyself go 
down," he said; "let thou see what a gracious God thou 
hast. He could send you an angel immediately, but he will 
never do it; yes, he should look at you! Thus Satan mocks 
Christ in the worst way. Christ alone has the word, 
otherwise he would be overcome. What did he give him in 
reply? V. 7: "Again, it is also written: Thou shalt not tempt 
God thy Lord." And after he had fought with this armor, 
the devil left him. 

(17) Above all, a Christian must believe in the mercy 
and goodness of God through Christ. Then he can be 
assured that he is protected and safe by it. Many have 
ruined themselves through mortification, losing body and 
life at the same time. Which we have also experienced 
ourselves. However, one must give the body only what is 
necessary and nothing superfluous, and always stand in 
the fight and be prepared, but with faith.

and words, and thus fight against the devil. No rule of the 
monks teaches faith, but other means are given to resist 
the devil, the flesh, the world. In Augustino one finds little 
about faith, in Jerome nothing at all. None of the ancient 
teachers is honest and sincere in teaching pure faith. 
They often praise virtues and good works, but seldom 
faith; for my own part, | used to believe that the first four 
chapters of the Epistle to the Romans were not useful for 
teaching, and that only the following ones were of any 
use, because they urged virtues. But by the grace of God 
| have been enlightened that | have learned from the first 
chapters of Paul's epistle to the Romans the 
righteousness of faith, which makes us Christians, and 
from the latter the characteristics of Christianity and what 
adorns it. 


V. 5. But who is the one who overcomes the world? 


Through the world he understands the devil, the flesh, 
and all evil. 


Without him who believes that Jesus is the Son of 
God. 


19 Faith overcomes, not works, not your life, not your 
fleeing from the company of women. It generally 
happens that those who flee to the deserts to avoid the 
company of many people suffer the greatest 
temptations, that it would have been better for them if 
they had lived with women and lived in a lawful marriage. 


V. 6 This is he who comes with water and blood, 
Jesus Christ, not with water alone, but with water 
and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies that the 
Spirit is truth. 

(20) This passage seems to be somewhat obscure, 
but it is certain that John brings this passage to the end 
to explain the means and way by which Christ came to 
us so that we can believe in Him. But he had said in the 
fourth verse that our faith is the victory that overcomes 
the world. But faith is believing in Christ. But here he 
continues and says, whence, and through 


what one has this faith. In the same way Paul speaks to 
the Romans in chapter 10, v. 13: "Whoever calls on the 
name of the Lord shall be saved. There he speaks step 
by step, and climbs higher and higher, v. 14: "But how 
shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? 
But how shall they believe, of whom they have heard 
nothing? But how shall they hear without a preacher?" 
And at last he stops at the word whence this faith comes, 
v. 17: "So faith comes from preaching, but preaching by 
the word of God." 

(21) This is against the scribblers, who consider the 
oral word to be something small. We, saith John, come 
not that we should first go to him, and make a beginning 
of coming; if he made not a beginning, and came to us 
first, we should never come to him. A lost sheep does 
not seek the Shepherd, for sinners and nature have an 
abhorrence of that way; the flesh seeks its own. "| am 
found of them that sought me not; And to the Gentiles 
that called not upon my name | say, Here am |, here am 
|. For | stretch out my hand all the day long to a 
disobedient people that walketh after their own thoughts 
in a way that is not good," Isa. 65:1, 2, Rom. 10:20, 21, 
so that no one may boast because of his own efforts and 
works, but know that it comes from the mercy of God. 
"This is the one who is coming", namely, to us. But in 
what way? 


With water and blood. 


22 Or (according to the Latin translation, per aquam 


et sanguinem) by water and blood. This is interpreted in 
various ways according to the common way. Most 
commentators refer to the two sacraments because 
when Christ's side was opened, water and blood flowed 
out of it. | do not dislike this explanation, but | understand 
it to mean baptism in general, if only it is properly applied 
and interpreted, that even the sprinkling of the blood of 
Christ comes to us. For the blood of Christ is regarded 
in two ways. First, it is shed in a bodily way; second, it is 
shed in a spiritual way, as Peter says. 


1506 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. 


W. ix, lass-1059. 1507 





Speaks, 1 Ep. 1, 1. 2. to the called saints in the sprinkling 
of the blood of Christ: "To the elect strangers, according 
to the provision of GOD the Father by the sanctification 
of the Spirit, for the obedience and sprinkling of the blood 
of JEsu Christ." This is the application of the blood of 
Christ, this is the benefit of the sprinkling of it, because it 
comes to me through the Word, and is received through 
the Word and faith; and so the blood spiritually cleanses 
and washes me, which was sprinkled bodily. So this 
understanding can take place, namely that this blood is 
rightly distinguished and applied. For Christ does not 
come by water alone, but by water joined with the blood, 
that is, by baptism dyed with blood. Otherwise the blood 
is of no use unless you believe that this blood was shed 
for you. John also came not only with water, baptizing 
into Christ who came, but also with blood, because the 
water of baptism is sanctified by the blood of Christ. 
Therefore it is not pure water, but water of blood, 
because of this blood of Christ, which is given to us 
through the Word, which brings with it the blood of Christ. 
And therefore it is said of us that we are baptized by the 
blood of Christ, and so we are washed away from sins. 
For water in and of itself does not cleanse us from sins. 

23 This text condemns everything that is based on 
human powers and actions. The Antichrist comes with 
his works, but the blood of Christ is of no use to him. A 
Jew comes with his ceremonies, but the blood of Christ 
is of no use to him either. But those who follow Christ 
come through water and blood, that is, through baptism; 
and so they enter the kingdom of Christ. That is why the 
new spirits go completely astray, who ridicule baptism 
and invent new ways. They call it a dog bath. And this is 
not to be wondered at; they alone have only water, but 
we also have blood. 

And it is the spirit that testifies that the spirit is 
truth. 


24 [In the Vulgate it reads thus: Et Spiritus est, qui 
testificatur, quoniam Christus. 





est veritas, that is, and it is the Spirit who testifies, 
because Christ is the truth]. Here, then, the texts diverge 
once again, and it is possible that in the old translation 
the word "Christ" was used instead of "Spirit. Christ 
comes through blood and water, but one more thing 
must be added, that although this gospel is preached, 
still no one accepts it unless the Spirit is present. 
Therefore John says, "It is the Spirit who bears witness 
in our hearts that the Spirit is truth." The water is there, 
and the blood is also there. This bestowal upon us never 
ceases. As long as the gospel is received, so long does 
this dispensation last; but it is not received unless the 
Spirit is with it. This preaching alone, and no other, is the 
means by which we receive the Holy Spirit; indeed, it is 
the word of grace and blessedness, as we read in the 
Acts of the Apostles in the 10th chapter, v. 44: "While 
Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell upon all 
them that heard the word." 


That spirit is truth. 


25 "Spirit" in John per 
metonymiam,') because it is of the Holy Spirit, John 
6:63: "The words that | speak are spirit and are life." For 
it is not acommon letter and human word, but full of the 
Spirit. The enthusiasts say: The letter is of no use, the 
outward things are of no use. John speaks against these 
and calls the word "spirit". When the word is preached 
pure and clear, which has redeemed us through baptism 
and blood, and one has heard this word of blood and 
water, then the Spirit testifies that this word is of the Spirit 
of truth, and is truth itself. After this, when one has 
received the Holy Spirit, the heart is certain and has 
confidence. 


V. 7 For there are three who bear witness in 
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; 
and these three are one.

Interpretation on 1 John 5:7-9. 


W. ix, E9-ww. 1509 





This verse has been indented by the orthodox on 
account of the Arians; which has not been done justly, 
because it does not speak of the witnesses in heaven, 
but of the witnesses on earth, here and there. 


V. 8. and there are three that testify in the earth: 
The Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the 
three are together. 


27 In Greek it reads: In unum sunt, in German: Und 
die drei Dinge gehéren zusammen. Water and blood, 
much less spirit, are not really and in fact one thing, but 


(sunt in unum) they belong together. So Paul says: "He 
who plants and he who waters are one and the same" 


(unum sunt), that is, they do it together, | Cor. 3, 8. So 
water cannot be preached without blood. And the blood 
of Christ is not given without the water of baptism. 
Moreover, blood and water do not come to us unless the 
Holy Spirit is the author, which is in the Word. Therefore, 
these three cannot be separated from each other, but 
these three do it together. 

28 Now behold how wretchedly the wretched spirits 
tore up this text. John makes these three into one, those 
but them from each other. In baptism is blood and spirit. 
If you are baptized in water, the blood of Christ is 
sprinkled through the Word. If you are baptized in blood, 
you are washed with the Holy Spirit through the Word. 
Consequently, these three must be taken as one 
testimony. For these three always accompany each 
other, and through the Word there is a daily immersion, 
and a perpetual baptism, a perpetual outpouring of the 
blood of Christ and the Holy Spirit, a constant cleansing 
from sins. For even though we are immersed once, yet 
baptism continues daily until we are completely washed 
away, and presented to God as a church that is glorious, 
as Paul says: "Christ loved the church, and gave himself 
for it, that he might sanctify it, and cleanse it by the 
washing of water in the word, that he might present it to 
himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or 
any such thing; but that it should be holy and without 
blemish," Eph. 5, 





25-27 So we are cleansed by the blood, by the water, 
and by the word of the Spirit, and so we are saved. 

In the last lesson we heard the way in which faith, or 
the spirit of our victory, comes to us, namely through the 
testimony, that is, through the gospel or word. He who 
seeks to be justified by anything else deceives himself. 
The oral word is preached after the apostles are sent 
out. They have done nothing in the world, indeed have 
begotten nothing, but by the word. So also today the 
Spirit does not testify other than through the word of the 
apostles. Therefore John proceeds according to his own 
way, and exhorts us to have faith and to cling firmly to 
this word, as to the testimony in which all other things 
converge. 


V. 9. If we accept the testimony of men, God's 
testimony is greater. 


(30) He concludes from the lesser to the greater. Now 
that | have taught you the way to obtain faith, take care 
of it and observe this way. For nothing challenges the 
devil so much as this testimony. For to this end he 
directs all his armor, that we should not retain this 
testimony. We accept the testimony of men," that is, we 
believe men when they testify; as it is said in the law, "In 
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter, or 
truth, stand," Deut. 19:15. But what are all men's 
testimonies, taken together, when compared with the 
testimony of God? We not only accept the testimony of 
men, but we are also willing to accept the testimony of 
heretics, we believe the slanderers 2c. Why do we not 
rather accept the divine testimony? This is a misery 
among us, that we believe the testimonies of men. In the 
same way Paul concludes Gal. 3, 15: "Dear brothers, | 
will speak in a human way: Do not despise a man's 
testimony when it is confirmed, and do nothing about it. 


For God's testimony is that which is greater 
(according to the Vulgate: Quoniam hoc est 
testimonium Dei, quod majus est). 


1510 Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, iiM-iosi. 1511 





31. He speaks of the testimony that we proclaim to 
you. 


Which he begat of his son. 


Our whole ministry is to establish this testimony of the 
Son of God in the hearts of men, but Satan directs all his 
deceptions to the effect that Christ is not the Son of God. 
So the deceivers deny Christ because they deny His 
words. Therefore John inculcates this testimony only 
that we believe that Christ is the Son of God. If | believe 
this, then | believe that God is true in his words and does 
not lie. 


V. 10: He who believes in the Son of God has this 
testimony with him. He who does not believe God 
makes him a liar, for he does not believe the 
testimony that God bears about His Son. 


(33) Then he explains what it is to "accept the 
testimony," that is, to believe. For he who accepts God's 
testimony believes in the Son of God; he who does not 
accept it does not believe, nor does he have the 
testimony of the Son with him. 


But he who does not believe God (according to the 
Vulgate: Qui non credit Fili, but he who does not 
believe the Son) makes him a liar. 


It seems as if the apostle needs many and useless 
words, but they are necessary. He wants to say what 
great danger it entails if one does not accept the Son. 
For he who does not accept him makes the Father a liar, 
which is a terrible thing. The fanciers make God the 
Father a liar, only so that they themselves may be 
truthful people. You see for yourselves how they teach. 
They make it appear that we should leave everything 
behind and confess the Spirit alone, and, ignoring the 
statutes of the world, cling to godliness alone. With these 
glib words they deceive the people. Furthermore, the 
words "this is my body" are not the statutes of the world. 

35. "To make God a liar" is as much as to rob God of 
His deity; but to take away His deity is as much as to rob 
God of His deity. 


Making God the Devil. To make oneself true is as much 
as to make oneself God. These are frightening things, 
which put in fear and trembling the one who is not sure 
in himself that he teaches divine things, especially in 
such doctrines of faith. In the doctrine of works it is not 
so dangerous to stumble. For if only the ground remains 
unharmed, one can rise again from the fall. But this is a 
most dangerous thing, not to believe in the Son. For it is 
just as much as saying to the Father to his face: You 
deny. "To deny God's truth" is as much as to deny His 
deity. "Not to believe in the Son" is as much as not to 
believe the Father's testimony about the Son, as the 
Arians and Cerinthus did. 

Take and eat, this is my body" are the most simple 
words, and Christ speaks there without any figure. And 
yet they do not believe this word. Consequently they 
deny the Son. For when | say: This is not true what you 
say, | say at the same time: This is not true that you are 
God. So all heretics stumble at this stone of stumbling. 
For when they say: These words are false according to 
the letter, then | say to them: It must also follow that the 
devil has spoken them. O wretched people! Our Lord lets 
you fall! He only keeps us on the way, so that we do not 
fall into this! If we only keep the reason and the 
testimony, then we will easily rise again from all grave 
sins. Even those who commit grave sins will recognize it 
in time and find a remedy. But where error and sin are 
not recognized, there is no remedy. This is the highest 
danger of souls. Beware of it. 


V. 11. And this is the testimony that God has given 
us eternal life; and such life is in His Son. 


(37) This exhortation is taken from the benefit, just as 
the previous one was taken from the danger and harm. If 
you accept this testimony, you will have eternal life. It is 
not pretense or hypocrisy, but true earnestness; it is no 
such testimony as this. 


1512 


Interpretation on 1 John 5:11-13. 


W. ix, 1064-1067. 1513 





The Father does not boast of His glory, but gives eternal 
life to the one who believes the Father's testimony about 
the Son. Therefore, we hold above this testimony. 

(38) For this is mighty: first, that the Godhead of 
Christ may be saved and preserved; and afterwards, that 
we may have eternal life. Every false teacher abolishes 
the Godhead, and makes a devilish being, and puts the 
devil in God's place. Consequently, every false teacher 
is the cause of idolatry and eternal damnation. For a 
false teacher abolishes God and all men as much as 
stands with him; not that he abolishes God according to 
his nature and essence, but from the hearts of men he 
takes him away. Therefore Peter speaks of these, that 
they introduce corrupt sects, and deny the Lord who 
bought them; they despise the rulers, are meager, self- 
willed, do not tremble to blaspheme the majesties", 2 
Petr. 2, 1. 10. How then did he give eternal life? He has 
given such life in his Son. 


V. 12. He who has the Son of God has life; he who 
does not have the Son of God does not have life. 


Therefore, if you want to have eternal life, you must 
necessarily have the Son. If you want to have the Son, 
you must necessarily have the Father's testimony of the 
Son. And so this is our whole life, that we remain exactly 
and firmly with the Father's testimony of the Son. But if 
truth is in the Son, and if the Son is our life, then he must 
necessarily be true God. But just as the enthusiasts are 
now making up glosses, so also the Arians did in former 
times in a certain epistle, which seems to be written very 
much according to the sense of the orthodox; in it they 
attributed everything to the Son of God, but they denied 
that he is the essential God. Of this you can read the 
Hilarium in his books of the Trinity. He who receives his 
life from another must have his essence from the one 
from whom he received life. No one is condemned who 
does not believe in a man; but, he who does not believe 
in the Son 


God, he will be condemned; and, he who believes in the 
Son of God, he will be saved, John 3:16. Therefore, the 
one in whom we believe must be the true God. God 
cannot be sought nor known without this testimony 
alone. For if one is not satisfied with the way God wants 
to be found by us, but wants to seek and prescribe his 
own way, that is not finding God, but the devil. We are 
to take care of the preservation of this testimony, as here 
the apostle is concerned about it, because we know both 
the danger and the benefit. 


V. 13. These things have I written unto you that 
believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may 
know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may 
believe on the name of the Son of God. 


(40) This is the purpose, says John, of all our 
teachings and admonitions, that our conscience may 
fully believe that we have a certain way of knowing 
eternal life, because our heart is too narrow to 
understand or grasp these things of God unless it is 
continually reminded and 1) exercised. "For eye hath not 
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart 
of man, the things which God hath prepared for them 
that love Him," 1 Cor. 2:9. We can hardly comprehend 
what is here on earth and perishable, how much less 
that which is heavenly. Therefore, the Spirit is given to 
us so that we may know how great things are given to 
us by God. But this cannot be understood better than 
through frequent practice and crosses. For | am to 
believe against the manifest understanding of all men, 
and to be assured that | shall live forever, seeing that in 
the meantime | am being eaten up by worms, yea, that 
not only shall | have eternal life in the future, but that | 
already have it now. "For he that believeth on me hath 
everlasting life," John 3:16. But because this mystery is 
hard, we must keep it continually, that we may keep it, 
and grow in faith. It is not a geometrical science, in which 


1) In the old edition: "for" instead of: and. 


1514 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1067-10M. 


1515 





It is not enough to have grasped it only once, but we must 
always learn it, and through the tribulations we must be 
trained in learning it. This is what Paul requires, "that we 
through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might 
have hope," Rom. 15:4. Fear, trembling, darkness are in 
us, and yet we are to believe that we have life in such 
great darkness. According to this John wants so much 
that we should know, and not doubt further, nor tremble, 
but have a certain science, that we may live and grow in 
faith. 

(41) Now, lest any man deceive us, John saith again 
against the falsifiers, that he wrote these things, saying, 
| have written these things unto you. The letter is with 
them a dead being on the paper. But John says, "| am 
writing to you, because the Scriptures are to be used as 
a means of attaining to faith and eternal life. For thus 
says John in the 20th chapter, v. 31, of his Gospel: 
"These are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the 
Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his 
name. Therefore we should know that the testimony of 
God does not come to us without the oral voice or 
through the Scriptures. "All Scripture inspired by God is 
profitable for doctrine, for judgment, for correction, for 
chastening in righteousness, that a man may be perfect 
in the sight of God, and fit for all good works," 2 Tim. 3:16, 
17. Likewise, in the preceding fifteenth verse of the above’ 
chapter, "Because you have known the Scriptures from 
childhood, they are able to instruct you unto salvation 
through faith in Christ Jesus." Item, 1 Tim. 4:13: 
"Continue reading, exhorting, teaching." Why does he 
command to read the Scriptures if it is a dead thing? Why’ 
do they write and publish books themselves, if the letter, 
is of no value nor use? Why do they want to instruct us 
and others through their writings? 

(42) If they say that the spirit is before the writing, and 
that they have the spirit first, after that they write, this is 
nothing. For in this way the Scripture is good for nothing 
but show. Hear what Christ says: "I pray not for them 
only, but also for them which are written by the Spirit. 


Their word will believe in me", Joh. 7, 20. By the word is 
certainly to be understood the oral or written, not the 
inward. Therefore, one must first of all hear and read the 
word, which the Holy Spirit uses as a means. When one 
reads the Word, the Holy Spirit is there, and in this way 
it is impossible for one to hear or read the Scriptures 
without benefit. 


And that you believe in the name of the Son of 
God. 


43 Not in our name, but only in the name of the Son 
of God. Many believe in the name of Benedicti or 
Francisci, few in the name of Christ. | mean those who 
put their trust in their works alone and not in the merit of 
Christ. 


V.14. And this is the joy that we have in him, that 
if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 


(44) This is an encouragement to Christians who have 
already been instructed how to believe and love, and that 
they have this piety from the preached word, and that 
one cannot live otherwise than in faith and love. To these 
now he denies an objection which they could have made 
to him: But how if my heart is cold, and | feel that | lack 
this faith? This is the remedy, says John: "Ask, beg, and 
he will hear you. Thus saith Jacob, If any of you lack 
wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to every man 
openly, and if no man draw it up, it shall be given him," 
Jac. 1:5. Therefore it is the noblest thing that thou lay 
thyself down to pray. So also Paul: "Do not be anxious, 
but in all things make your request known before God in 
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving," Phil. 4:6. 
Likewise Augustine: "Lord, give what you want. So we 
should also say: Lord, give that we may believe. 

Therefore, these words are an exhortation to prayer, 
which he beautifully designs. First, he encourages trust, 
which is the soul of prayer; then he prescribes the way in 
which you should pray, 


1516 


namely, that you ask what is useful, according to the will 
of God. There must also be the confidence that one will 
be heard. For "a doubter is unstable in all his ways. But 
he prayeth in faith, and doubteth not," Jac. 1:8, 6. 
Therefore, he that will pray truly, let him not pray horas 


canonicas, but short prayers, as David and Jeremiah did, 
but so that he may fully believe that he will be heard. "It 
shall come to pass, before they call, that | will answer; 
while they yet speak, that | will hear," Isa. 65:24. Then 
may we appropriate His promises, and "ask according to 
His will." If | feel that | am being challenged and tempted 
with evil desire, and | know his will, | pray that | may be 
free from evil desire, or whatever it is, of which we are 
sure that we pray according to his will, then we may have 
confidence, and be sure that he hears us. 


V.15. And if we know that he hears what we ask, 
we know that we have the request which we asked of 
him. 

(46) Now if you, by virtue of this confidence, fully 
believe that you will be heard, He will also give you what 
you have asked. When Solomon prayed, God said to 
him, "Ask what you want me to give you. And Solomon 
said, "Thou wilt give thy servant an obedient heart, that 
he may judge thy people, and understand what is good 
and what is evil. This pleased the Lord well that Solomon 
asked for such a thing. And God said unto him, Because 
thou askest these things, and askest not for long life, nor 
for riches, nor for the soul of thine enemies, but for 
understanding judgment, behold, | have done according 
to thy words," 1 Kings 3:5 ff. Because he had asked 
according to the will of God, he was heard. But it is not 
proper to determine the time and the hour. Abraham was 
promised seed and a son from his womb, Genesis 
13:15, 18. It was almost twenty years before he was 
granted this promise. But he waited patiently for it. So 
Sarah also thought, "Perhaps this son shall not be born 
of me, but of another. Therefore, we should not tell God 
the time or the way when and how to answer our prayer. 


Interpretation of 1 John 5:14, 15 





. W. ix, 1060-1072. 1517 


We are only to wait patiently and diligently; and a 
Christian is content with this, because a Christian is 
content that he knows he pleases God, and is certain 
that his prayer will be heard, and not rejected, but 
accepted. And this is the joyfulness according to His will, 
as He said in the previous verse. 

47 Behold, he saith, "We have the request," and yet 
it cannot be regarded as such; yea, at times the 
contradiction appears. But the outcome proves that they 
had faith and were in grace. When God wanted to deliver 
the children of Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, he 
led them into a corner, so that wherever they looked, 
they saw death and destruction. Then reason said, 
"Were there not tombs in Egypt, that you had to lead us 
away to die in the wilderness? Why did you do this to us, 
to bring us out of Egypt?" Ex. 14, 11. They have 
redemption, but they do not see the manner, nor the 
persons. The sea was divided from one another, so that 
they went into the midst of the sea on dry land. But this 
way could not go to their hearts. There were also 
infinitely many other ways by which divine omnipotence 
could redeem them. He could throw away a mountain. 
So we should also say: Lord, you will give me the where, 
how, and in a better way than | can understand. The 
ways of salvation are not known to us, but in the 
meantime we should be sure that we will be heard, yes, 
that we are already heard. St. Bernard addresses his 
brothers thus: Dear brothers, do not despise your 
prayer, for as soon as it has gone out of your mouth, it is 
also heard in heaven; and be sure that what you have 
asked will either be given to us, or that what has been 
asked will not be useful. This is quite rightly said. So we 
also teach that we should not despise our prayer. 

(48) Thus far we have not known how to pray, but 
only to talk and read the prayers, which God does not 
respect. For no one thinks: Lord, you have commanded 
to pray, Lord, you have promised the answer to prayer. 
Which two 


1518

1519 





pieces are necessarily required. Then one comes and 
asks something great, for the church, for the ministers 
of the Word, for the authorities. For we have our 
pleasure in such prayers, which are said for many and 
great things. | often pray thus: Help, O Lord, the 
authorities, assist our brethren, bring the erring back to 
the right path, strengthen and sustain the steadfast. 
Lord, this | ask. | do not dare to ask this unless you have 
commanded it, and unless you have promised an 
answer 2c. 


V. 16 If anyone sees his brother sin, a sin not unto 
death, he may ask; and he shall give life to them that 
sin not unto death. It is a sin unto death; for this I say 
not that any man ask. 


49 There is a hidden objection in these words. | 
know, dear brothers, that there are sinners in the church 
who do not sin seven times, but probably seventy times 
seven times against their brother, Matth. 18, 22. There 
are some sins that cannot be forgiven, therefore one 
prays for them in vain. And from this text flowed the 
gloss, namely: Another is a venial sin, and another is a 
mortal sin. By mortal sin | mean such a sin as the sins 
of Korah, Dothan and Abiram, of which we read in 
chapter 16, v. 15, of the fourth book of Moses, where 
Moses prays against them: "Do not turn to their grain 
offering. | have not taken a donkey from them, nor have 
| ever harmed any of them." Such are the sins that are 
done under the appearance of godliness, and do not 
want to be sins, as they are. Such are the sins of 
heretics, who are hardened after one and another 
admonition, so the apostle commands them to be 
avoided, Titus 3:10 ff: "Avoid a heretical man when he 
has been admonished once and again. And know that 
such a one is reprobate, and sins as one who has 
condemned himself." For other sins, which occur either 
out of weakness or on some occasion, | can pray that 
they will be forgiven and not imputed. For heretics | 
cannot do this, if they do not recognize the sin. | can 
pray, 





that God may convert them before they are completely 
hardened; but where they will not be corrected, | pray, 
"Lord, do not let what they want be righteousness or 
justice, but demonstrate your righteousness in them. 

(50) By "sin unto death" | mean the heresy they 
introduce instead of the truth. If they do not repent after 
being reminded once and again, then it is a sin unto 
death. But to these can be added those who sin out of 
stubbornness, in defiance, like Judas, who was warned 
enough, but because of his stubborn wickedness he 
could not be corrected; also Saul, who died in his sins 
because he did not hope in the Lord. But those who sin 
in such a way that they still want to maintain and defend 
the recognized error, in them is the highest 
stubbornness. The same sin is also the sin against the 
Holy Spirit, or the hardening in wickedness, the denial of 
the recognized truth, and the impenitence to the end. 
Another sin is the sin that is not unto death, which was 
the sin of Paul when he said, "I did it ignorantly, in 
unbelief," that is, "having been before a blasphemer, 
and a persecutor, and a reproacher; but mercy was 
shewed me." 1 Tim. 1, 13. Of which sin also Christ 
speaks Matth. 12, 32: "Whoever speaks anything 
against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him." Likewise, 
the sin of the crucifiers of Jesus was not unto death, to 
whom Peter says, "Now, brethren, | know that ye did it 
through ignorance," Acts 3:17. For if they had known 
them, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory," 1 
Cor. 2:8. But this sin, because it is still defended after it 
has been fully revealed and known, is a sin unto death, 
because it is contrary to divine grace, the means of 
salvation, and the forgiveness of sins. Where there is no 
knowledge of sins, there is no forgiveness. For the 
forgiveness of sins is preached to those who feel sin and 
seek the grace of God. But these are not troubled by any 
scruples of conscience, nor do they recognize or feel 
sin. 


1520 


Interpretation of 1 John 5:17-20. 


1521 


W. ix, 1075-1077. 





V. 17. All unrighteousness is sin, and some sin is 
not unto death. 


(51) Virtue is counted as sin against God and 
neighbor, but not all virtue is to death. Satan plagues us 
with imaginary and true sins. Where he finds a true sin, 
he makes it greater than it is, and also makes God's 
wrath greater, so that he may draw us away from 
confidence in God. If it is not a true sin, he takes a good 
work done out of a good heart, and from it he makes a 
great sin. Such an artist is he who can make sin. 
Accordingly, it seems as if John meant to say this much: 
Everyone who does wrong or unrighteousness is a 
sinner, but some sins are not unto death. Therefore, let 
us not despair, but let us offer one another our hand and 
lift us up. 


V. 18. We know that whoever is born of God does 
not sin, but whoever is born of God keeps himself. 


This is a conclusion or short repetition of the 
preceding. But the summa is this: "We know that 
whoever is born of God does not sin," but "the birth of 
God," that is, that he is born of God, or the birth of faith, 
which he has from God, "preserves him. Accordingly, 
these things dispute with each other, that one is born of 
GOD, and that he sins. But it can happen that he 
sometimes makes a mistake, then he sins; but not in so 
far as he is born of God, but as a man. Thus Paul says 
to Romans 7:25: "So then | serve the law of God with my 
mind, but the law of sins with my flesh. A Christian is 
divided into two parts. Sometimes man is hasty when 
that (the divine) birth from the divine word is not 
supported, and the flesh keeps the upper hand, so that 
he does something that he 1) otherwise would not do. 
Sometimes the spirit overcomes the unbelief and the 
affections, and thus does not sin. 


1) In the old edition: it. 


And the Arge will not touch it. 


The evil one is either Satan or the world. But why will 
he not touch him? That is, why does he not do what the 
evil one would like to have? Therefore: As long as he 
stands in the birth of God, he can be tempted, but not 
overcome, and immediately rises again. Satan indeed 
touches him to tempt him, but he does not touch him and 
does not come to him to overcome him. Therefore, let us 
make every effort to remain in the faith and in the divine 
birth, so that we are well guarded against sinning. 


V. 19. We know that we are of God, and the whole 
world is in trouble. 


54. This is its own right title: The world is a kingdom 
of wickedness, and the devil is lord over it. Those who 
do not believe are citizens of the world, and follow its 
rule, and are in trouble with the world. But those who 
believe snatch themselves from the world and from the 
kingdom of wickedness, and are gathered into the 
kingdom of faith and blessedness. Therefore a Christian 
must do this, that he trusts no one, but each one thinks 
as if he had to deal with malicious and spiteful people, 
with enemies and ingrates, and expects persecution and 
the highest ingratitude for the good deeds. For what do 
they pay us for our many labors? Nothing other than that 
they wish us to be cast down to hell and suffer all 
misfortune. They repay us for the greatest good deeds 
with the greatest evil deeds. Accordingly, this passage 
refers to patience. 


V. 20. But we know that the Son of God is come, 
and hath given us a mind to know him that is true. 

55: "And has given us a purpose," that is, the Holy 
Spirit. That is beautifully spoken. For if | have this sense 
that Christ has come, | now have the sense of the Holy 
Spirit. Then we can boast that we have the Holy Spirit, 
because he can never be separated from his word. And 
then we recognize the true God. 


1522 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. IX, 1077-1080. 15ZZ 





And are in the True One, in His Son, Jesus Christ. 


(56) For there are many who believe that Christ is the 
Son of God, but not the true one. Therefore he adds, that 
we are in the true Son of God, that is, in God's own Son, 
whom he begat from eternity. 


This one (namely the Son) is the true God and the 
eternal life. 


This is now Summa Summarum, that is, the short 
epitome of blessedness, about which the Church 
triumphs and rejoices, that man is true God, and that in 
this God and man we all have eternal life. The Arians 
admitted that Christ was God, but not the true God; and 
although they sometimes called him a true God, they did 
not call him a true God. 





But if they did not know Him, they denied that He was of 
the same essence as the Father, and so they knew 
neither the Father nor the Son, nor did they have eternal 
life. "For this is the eternal last, that they may know thee, 
O Father, who alone art the true God, and whom thou 
hast sent, Jesus Christ," John 17:3. 


V. 21. Little children, beware of idols. Amen. 

(58) | believe this is added for the sake of the weak. 
For since at that time they were forced by sword and 
torture to deny the true God, they had to be encouraged 
not only not to worship the idols, but also to keep 
themselves from them and not to defile themselves in 
some way by worshipping them.

John. *) 


1529 and 1530.

Frauen in Halle. 


Preface. 


The main content of this first letter of John is about 
love, just as this apostle's gospel had primarily the 
independent word as its final purpose. He had begun 
this gospel of his almost with the very words with which 
he concludes this letter. There his beginning had been: 
"In the beginning was the Word", and here he 
concludes: "Let JEsus be the true God and the eternal 
life". 





2 This letter of John has some special characteristics 
before other letters of the apostles. He constantly uses 
the words: life, light, hate, love, grace, death, darkness, 
Satan; and what is most distinguished, the word: 
proclamation. For this is the short epitome of what he 
wants to write. For he teaches, first of all, that 
repentance is not of a right kind if it does not bear its 
righteous fruits. Light and darkness 





*This interpretation is different from the previous interpretation and later than the same. In the determination of the time we followed 
Késtlin (Martin Luther, 3rd ed., vol. Il, p. 157). Several facts mentioned in the interpretation, e.g. Hetzer's death [Cap. 3, ? 29), Feb. 4, 1529, 
the reference to his "Heerpredigt wider den Tirken" [Cap. 4, s 4), which went out at the end of Octobers 1529 2c., clearly indicate that these 
lectures cannot belong to an earlier time. Kdstlin (Il, 272) expresses the assumption that Luther had read this letter until the year 1531. Since 
this writing (according to Luther's own manuscript s?”, as Walch says) is found only in Walch, we must limit ourselves to the reprint of it. 


Rambach made his translation in the year 1743.

niss do not send themselves together. God loved us first 
in order to be loved by us again. To whom this reason 
does not touch the heart, all other reasons may not 
move him. Reason, law and worldly wisdom also teach 
that morals must be changed, but they cannot give us 
the power to change them, only the word of this 
proclamation can do that. 

3. John, as thought above, had dealt with the word in his 
gospel; but here 





it deals with the love with which we serve our brothers. 
Both books are now to be diligently taken to hand, 
although they are different in their final purpose. This 
epistle is a magnificent treasury of many spiritual and 
heavenly truths. Just as in his Gospel he told the story 
of the life, teaching, words and deeds of Christ our Lord 
and Savior, so now in this booklet he tells how one 
should follow him in his life, teaching, words and deeds. 


The first chapter. 


V. 1. that which was from the beginning, which we 
have heard, which we have seen. 


1 John teaches right at the beginning of his letter 
what he wants to be regarded for by others in the 
treatise, namely for such a one as Paul describes in 1 
Cor. 4:1, 2: "Everyone regards us as such, namely as 
Christ's servants and stewards of God's mysteries. But 
now no one looks for more in a steward than that he may 
be found faithful." Just as Christ Himself gave them the 
command, John 15:27: "You shall be My witnesses, for 
you have been with Me from the beginning." But at the 
same time he meets all who approve the preaching of 
the gospel and the testimony of Christ contained therein, 
according to its outward presentation and the moral 
doctrine comprehended therein, and shows them the 
mystery of Jesus, who was from the beginning and will 
be forever. As Paul also says [Hebr. 1, 10.] that through 
him the foundation of the world was laid, but that in the 
last times he appeared in the world and was revealed as 
God in the flesh, Hebr. 1, 2. 3. So the apostle John wants 
to say: "This word, which was from the beginning, we 
proclaim to you, and that as unimpeachable witnesses 
of everything that has happened, namely that the 
independent word, which from eternity was with God in 
God himself, has become flesh. As now from a witness 
he 





that he must have seen or heard a thing of which he 
wants to testify, so John also says of himself and others 
that they had heard and seen, even touched with their 
hands, what they were talking about. 

(2) What is the benefit of this? The fruit of this 
revelation of Christ in the flesh has been well indicated 
by the one who has briefly summarized the contents of 
this letter and placed them before it, in these words: that 
the works of the devil should be destroyed, and we 
should be saved from the image of death; that we should 
come to know the Father, and his beloved Son, our Lord 
Jesus. This is the most noble fruit, and is interspersed 
by John throughout: that we may have fellowship one 
with another. 

This is the main sentence executed by Johanne in 
this letter. 


That was there from the beginning, that we have 
heard, that we have seen. 

4 These words especially refer to the unquestionable 
certainty of the testimony that John gave in his 
evangelical teaching. 


What we have seen. 


5 The apostle does not speak of curiosity at all here, 
but the word he uses refers primarily to the length of time 
in which she revealed this in the flesh. 


1526 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, loW-ioso. 1527 





Word considered. Eceaodpecka it is said, we 

have looked at it with great attention, there have been 
no furtive glances, we have been there and beside it for 
a long time, we have looked at it often and for a long 
time. 


What our hands have palpated. 


(6) These words are actually addressed to Thomas, 
for to him it was said, according to the account of John, 
Cap. 20, 27, "Reach out your finger and put your hand 
into my side." And further, v. 29. "Because thou hast 
seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; blessed are they 
that see not, and yet believe." This, says John, we 
proclaim to you. Thomas wanted to touch the nail marks 
in the hands and side of Christ with his hands, and it was 
granted him. But lest anyone should think that such a 
bodily sensation is necessary for salvation, Jesus wisely 
added: "Blessed are they that see not, and yet believe. 
Augustine has very beautiful words about this in his book 
on nature and grace: In the heart, he says, are the 
spiritual hands that grasp Christ. And this is the word that 
is proclaimed. In John, Cap. 17, 20, Christ prays not only 
for his disciples, as his visible witnesses, "but also for all 
who would believe in his name through their word. 

7 The things and the signs of them must be accepted 
and maintained in the Church of God as Christ has 
ordained. For what God ordains does not have to be 
abolished. Yes, some say, God is a spirit, and therefore 
one must also have purely spiritual ideas about God. 
This has moved our new prophets to make every effort 
to abolish the external word of God, as they call it. As 
soon as they only took to their hearts the sentence: God 
is a spirit, they also concluded: Ergo, baptism and the 
sacrament of the altar are nothing. However, we are 
bound to stay with the Scriptures, which alone can teach 
us correctly about the will of God. But God's will is not of 
one kind. First, the secret and hidden will of God, which 
is not prescribed for us as the rule of our actions. 
Secondly, the revealed one; this must be 





to learn to recognize from the words of God. The spirit 
makes spirit. An evil spirit also fills the spirit of man with 
evil. It is Satan's work to teach his mind to others. 
Therefore, such people are not afraid to say, "What is a 
handful of water for? If these people had not been more 
seriously opposed, they would have finally come to deny 
that Christ had ever come into the world; they would have 
considered it a dream and no longer a truth. The means 
that God has instructed must be maintained. After all, 
God could let grain grow on the roof. And so, even 
without the external word, He could make people 
blessed. But it does not please Him to proceed in this 
way. It is a bad conclusion: it seems to me that it has 
been done quite well, therefore it must be so. Christ 
therefore commanded that his gospel should be 
preached to every creature. "What is spoken to you in 
your ears you shall proclaim on the housetops,"” Matth. 
10, 27. Their sound, that is, the preaching of the gospel, 
"has also gone out into all the world," Rom. 10, 18. Now 
and then people have been found who have prepared a 
cross for themselves and carried it around; others have 
had themselves forged into chains and considered this 
their cross. But the true cross must be carried as God 
sends it. In the same way, our enthusiasts teach that one 
should run away from wife, child, house, and farm, and 
that this should be the means of escaping the 
temptations of Satan. 


That was there from the beginning. 


This is the same truth that Paul describes in Eph. 1, 4: 
"Before the foundation of the world was laid. And Joh. 1, 
1.:"In the beginning was the word." But what kind of word 
is this that was already there before the foundation of the 
world? None other than God Himself. For before the 
foundation of the world no creature existed. Apart from 
God, nothing existed yet. Therefore, this Word was God 
Himself. But this Word became man. O! a great miracle 
that God Himself took on human nature; but before the 
eyes of the world it is something foolish. How?

she says, can God give birth to his equal? And in the 
schools one leads the sentence: Duo extrema in 
materia remotissima non conveniunt, two infinitely 
distant things can never be united. 


From the words of life. 


9. this is given Joh. 1, 14. with the words: "We saw 
His glory, a glory as of the only begotten Son from the 
Father, full of grace and truth." 

(10) Here both the teachers and the hearers find their 
reminder. 1) Teachers should learn here that they 
should not rely on their own thoughts and imagination, 
but carefully compare them with the Scriptures and 
consider the words: The spirits of the prophets are 
subject to the prophets. No prophecy or interpretation of 
Scripture is to be considered sound unless it is similar to 
faith. It does not follow at all if one concludes: Well, one 
has joy and pleasure in it. By this thought some have 
been deceived, when they put the similarity of faith out 
of sight. A prophecy cannot be worthy of this name other 
than when it is for the glory of God, for the strengthening 
of faith, and for the edification of the neighbor. 
Therefore, these were evil prophets who took it upon 
themselves to overthrow and exterminate the worldly 
authorities. And Christ punished his disciples seriously 
when they asked for fire to fall from heaven on the 
Samaritans. The spirits of the prophets are subject to the 
prophets. Your spirit shall not rule you, but God's spirit. 
Beware of those who say: The spirit drives me. One 
must, as John speaks below, be sure of his cause. 


Hence he calls it an unction; and Paul a plerophoriam, 
a certainty connected with great joy. 1) 

11. 2) The listeners must be well aware of 
themselves, so that they do not allow themselves to be 
weighed and swayed by every wind of doctrine, but 
rather examine everything according to the guidelines 
presented. Whoever wants to present something as the 
word of God must also be certain that it is the word of 
God. 


1) Here a few lines are missing in the manuscript, which especially 
because of the faded ink could not be read, and no sense could be 
brought out. (Walch.) 





Let the word of God be. By the way, on the part of the 
listeners it must mean: Examine everything and keep the 
best. And in the book of Acts it says of the Bereans: 
"They inquired whether it was so", Apost. 17, 11. 


Word of life. 


This is a very beautiful description of the word, that it 
is called "a word of life". As John wrote in the first chapter 
of his Gospel, v. 4, 5: "In him was life, and the life was 
the light of men; and the light shineth in darkness." But 
this word excludes the whole law, as it is not in its power 
to make alive, but it is a word that announces wrath and 
death because of the transgression done by sin, which 
cannot be lifted or lessened by the law. Therefore it is 
said in Rom. 4, 15: "The law brings wrath", and Rom. 5, 
20: "The law came in beside", so that sin would be 
recognized as sin. Here belongs what is read in the 17th 
chapter of Matthew, v. 1 ff., and Luc. 9, 28 ff. about the 
transfiguration of Christ on a mountain; which 
transfiguration Paul explained according to its spiritual 
meaning of the different splendor of the law and the 
gospel, 2 Cor. 3 and 4.

The fruit and benefit of this proclamation is the 
fellowship, in which many have equal shares, none more 
than the other. Therefore, the fruit and benefit of this 
proclamation is the fellowship built on the foundation of 
the prophets and apostles; as Paul also taught in Eph. 
2:19, 20: "Now you are no longer sojourners and 
strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints and 
members of God's household, built on the foundation of 
the prophets and apostles, of whom Jesus is the 
cornerstone," that is, now you share in all that believers 
have in Christ Jesus. This is also what is taught in the 
14th chapter of John, v. 23, with these words: "He who 
loves me will keep my word. My Father will love him, and 
we will make our abode with him." The apostles often 
make use of this word: He-

construction. And there is also a beautiful likeness in it. 
In a building, all parts, whether of wood or stone, are 
neatly joined together. In this spiritual building, the 
master builders are teachers and preachers; they work 
the stones so that they become smooth and even. They 
cleanse the hearts with the Word; they dwell under a tent 
to hide from heat and frost. No temptation is so great to 
them that they should not overcome it. And just as a 
cornerstone serves to prevent trucks and other vehicles 
from harming the house, so also the evil that Satan and 
the world threaten this spiritual building is averted by 
Christ, and our dwelling place is made safe with the 
Father. 


We write these things to you that you may have 
joy, that your joy may be complete. 


This is a proverbial speech that contains so much that 
the human heart cannot rejoice enough when it hears the 
proclamation of the word of life. 


V. 5. God is a light. 


What he called a community earlier, he now presents 
as a light. 


And in him there is no darkness. 1) 


The proclamation of the gospel punishes the world 
for sin and exhorts to repentance. 


That GOD is a light. 2) 
In his light we see the light.

And do not do the truth. 3)

and that God will take care of us for the sake of Christ. 
Since God is light and there is no darkness in Him, and 
this is the content of this proclamation, it follows that 
everything that does not belong to this proclamation or 
runs counter to it is pure darkness. The opposite of 
John's opinion is therefore this: Do not admire what the 
world admires. Do not pull on the yoke with the 
unbelievers. Only the pagans strive for this. He who 
hates his brother walks in darkness and does not know 
where he is going, for the darkness has blinded his eyes. 
So we say “) 

21. to be in the light means as much as to know where 
to go. "To be in darkness means not to know where to 
go. But now we are in the light and know where to go. 
We were in darkness when we served the saints and 
were in many errors. But now the light shines and the 
word of life has appeared. Without this word everything 
is darkness. 


Do the truth. 


(22) That is, to walk in the light and to know the way 
to go. In the following chapter it says [v. 8, 9]: "I write you 
a new commandment, which is true of him and of you. 
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is 
yet in darkness." 


And walk in darkness. 
That is, we do not know that God is a light. 


V.7 But if we walk in the light. 


That is, if we know where to go. John 15:15 says, 
"Unto you | said, that ye are my friends: for all things 
whatsoever | have received of my Father | have given 
unto you." And Joh. 17, 25. 26.: "Righteous Father, the 
world knoweth not thee: but | know thee, and these know 
that thou hast sent me. And | have given them

| have made known your name, and will make it known 
to them, that love, that you may love me, may be in them, 
and | in them." 


This way we have fellowship among 
ourselves. 


25 That is, then the proclamation of Jesus has the 
effect it is supposed to have. 


And the blood of JEsu Christ. 


(26) For even in the saints there is still impurity, so 
they do not think that the blood of Christ alone has 
sufficed for real sins, but that the rest must be atoned for 
by our own atonement; rather, they stick to the word of 
God, so that they can stand in the face of temptation. 
The Holy Scriptures therefore clearly and certainly testify 
that the blood of Christ has been sufficient both for our 
inherited sins and for our real sins. For this is why John 
says, "It makes us clean from all sin," just as it is also 
said in the words which soon follow [v. 9.], "If we confess 
our sin, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and 
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,” ddiyiac. Notice 
that 

This word, QOIYid, includes all vices and all stimuli to 
vices and vices, that is, both the secret tinder to evil and 
the real outward deed and imitation of what is called evil. 
Moreover, this saying is taken from a prophet who says, 
"Who can know how often he fails?" Ps. 19, 13. Paul 
teaches the same in Rom. 3, 23-25, and asserts "that all 
men are sinners and lack the glory which they ought to 
have before God, but that they are justified without merit 
by His grace through the redemption that came about by 
Jesus Christ, whom God made a mercy seat through 
faith in His blood, so that He might present the 
righteousness that is valid before Him, in that He forgives 
sin, which until then had remained under divine 
patience". John therefore also says in the following 3rd 
chapter, v. 20. 21: "If our heart does not condemn us, 
God is greater than our heart, and knows all things." Yes, 
"if our heart does not condemn us, then we have joy in 


GOD". In addition, there is the statement of Paul in Rom. 
3, 28: "Therefore we hold that a man is justified by faith 
and not by the works of the law. Those who want to 
remove and make up for real sins by their own works and 
atonements are playing a joke and blasphemy with the 
blood of Christ. The persecution of the church is certainly 
areal sin, but the forgiveness of it is by grace, Gal. 1, 4. 
When Augustine speaks of the merit of sins, he cites 
Paul's saying from Rom. 5, 15. 16: "But it is not the case 
with the gift as with sin. For the gift is not over one sin 
alone, as through the one sinner's one sin is all 
destruction. For the judgment came from one sin to 
condemnation; but the gift helps from many sins to 
righteousness." Adam begat sinful men, and from him 
they have the evil nature. But Christ also atoned for and 
forgave all the sins that arose from this inherited 
corruption, that is, he remedied our inherited and real 
sins. This fifth chapter to the Romans teaches that there 
is a twofold Adam, an old one and a new one. Now each 
of them has brought something into the world; and they 
are equal to each other in respect of reproduction and 
sharing, but very unequal to each other in respect of 
kind. The first Adam was only a man, but the other is 
God and man at the same time. The first is from earth, 
but the other is from heaven. The first brought sin, death 
and the curse of the law from his descendants, but the 
other brought grace instead of sin, life instead of death, 
forgiveness of sins instead of the curse of the law. It is 
not a matter of defiance when God gives something 
special; not of despair when He gives nothing. 


v. 8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive 
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 

(27) Not only is there no truth and righteousness in 
us, but instead there is vain carnal security. Of such 
certainty Jerome wrote: Confusione non sunt confusi, et 
erubescere nesciunt, for all the confusion of their minds 
they are bold.

and safe, and have not learned to be ashamed. 
Therefore, God says in the prophet: "Go through the 
streets of Jerusalem, and look, and learn, and search in 
her streets, whether ye find any that doeth right, and 
asketh after faith; and | will be gracious unto her," Jer. 
5:1. In John, Cap. 9:41, Christ says: "If ye were blind, ye 
would have no sin: but now ye say, We have sight, your 
sin remaineth." And Paul calls such people [Eph. 4, 19.] 


dmndynyotec, people who lost their sense and 
conscience, "wicked people." So in our days people say: 
| want to live as my ancestors lived. This is the world's 
greatest sin, that it does not want to recognize sin. 
We have no sin. 
28 This means that it is not necessary for the blood of 


Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to cleanse us from our 
sins. 


We are deceiving ourselves. 


The fire will reveal such deceit through our own 
conscience. 


And the truth is not within us. 


(30) That is, we then have nothing at all to rely on, 
especially in the hours of temptation. The doctrine that 
one should make rest for oneself by one's own works 
paves the way to despair. 


V. 9 But if we confess. 

31 Here John meets the objection: What shall | do to 
him, | am a sinner, my conscience reproaches me that 
my sins are many. John says: Confess your 





Sin. And thus he puts to shame all these objections, 
when the conscience asks: What shall | do that | may be 
saved? How shall | attack it, that | may be better? 
Nothing else, he says, but this: Confess your sin, absolve 
him of your heavy debts. Remember the words: "Why do 
you grieve, my soul, and are so troubled within me? Wait 
upon God; for | will yet confess and give thanks unto him, 
that he is the help of my countenance, and my God," Ps. 
42:12. 


GOD is faithful. 


He keeps his word and his promises. 


He is just. 


He who loves justice cannot suffer injustice. 
Therefore, God's justice requires that one confess the 
sins before Him and ask for the remission of the well- 
deserved punishments. 


Of all vice. 


34 That is, of all whom he himself is dear to his heart. 


V. 10. We make him a liar. 


(35) He who is faithful and true in nature is then 
blasphemed by us. 


And his word is not in us. 


For his word has decreed all things sinful and 
subjected them to the judgment of condemnation. The 
Holy Spirit punishes the world for sin. Here belongs the 
word of Paul, Rom. 10, 15: God sends teachers, the 
messengers must preach, but their word must also be 
received.

1536 


(2) There are things in this chapter which not only 
concern the timid consciences, but also provoke all other 
Christians to see that they do not sin wantonly. For the 
Scriptures give us a twofold instruction: first, how we are 
to be freed from sin; but afterwards, how we are to avoid 
it. Those who closed the access of the fallen to the grace 
of God took this admonition and what is read in the 
epistle to the Hebrews as their reason, and therefore did 
not want to receive the fallen back into the community. 
On the other hand, it should be noted that through Christ 
one can obtain forgiveness of sins at any time, if only the 
fallen are serious about being received back into grace. 


If anyone sins, we have an advocate with 
the Father. 

(3) There is a pleasant confusion of persons here. 
John includes himself among the three and says that he 
also needs such an intercessor, since he also has sin in 
himself and therefore also needs forgiveness of it. As St. 
Paul also writes about himself: "I wretched man, who will 
deliver me from the body of this death", Rom. 7, 24. 


That you do not sin. 


What this means: "not to sin", Paul explained with the 
words Rom. 6, 12: "Let not sin reign in our mortal body, 
to render obedience to it in its lusts. Therefore, "there is 
nothing condemnable in those who are in Christ JEsu," 
Rom. 8, 1. Among men in the world this rule is not 


unknown: Qui non peccat, est beatus, he who does 
not sin is blessed. But there are many kinds of 
blessedness, among which the last alone is worthy of 
this name. 1) A happiness of the world, which a man can 
attain by often repeated actions, according to the saying: 
Ex actibus saepe iteratis fit habitus [if one does 
something often, it becomes a habit]. If you want to learn 
to write, write often; if you want to become orderly, do it 
often. To this belongs what Paul says about the Gentiles, 
Rom. 1, 21. The Gentiles have 


Interpretation on 1 John 2, 1. 2. W. ix, 1096-1099. 





1537 


They did not recognize and glorify God as God, but 
whoever did something good for them, they worshipped 
as a god. 2) A blessedness of the law, which comes 
from the outward observance of the ten 
commandments, ceremonies and worldly ordinances. 3) 
A blessedness of the gospel, which is contained in the 
words, "He who believes shall also be saved. 4) The 
greatest blessedness is this, that Christ Himself is the 
propitiation for our sin. This is widely explained in the 
16th Psalm, which in the superscription XXXX is called 


Michtam, or a golden jewel. In the letter to Timothy, Paul 
gave the exhortation that bodily exercises are of little 
use, but godliness is profitable for all things, and has the 
promise of this life and the life to come, 1 Timothy 4:8. 

5) "Do not sin" also means to sigh after committing a 
sin: "Oh, what have | done? 


So we have an advocate. 


6 Augustine says: "Just as he who entrusts 
something to an eloquent and experienced man to carry 
out in the affairs of this life, does so in order that he may 
not lose the thing, should you then be lost if you entrust 
yourself to this intercessor? Christ is a most excellent 
guardian. 


v. 2. for the sin of the whole world. 


Here John meets the objection that a despondent 
person might make: Yes, | am not one of the number of 
the apostles. Therefore Christ is the propitiation for the 
sins of the whole world. This is a phrase that means a 
perpetual continuation of a thing. As it is said in the 19th 
Psalm, v. 2. 3.: "The heavens tell the glory of God; one 
day tells another, one night proclaims another"; which 
means: As long as in nature one day will follow another, 
one night another, so long shall God's glory be 
proclaimed and spread! So also here it is said of the 
atonement of Christ: "It is for the sins of the whole 
world", that is, for all sins that have ever been committed 
and will be committed until the end of the world. 


1538

1539 





V.3 And by this we know that we know him, if we 
keep his commandments. 


(8) Here John has summarized many things, all of 
which are as follows: 1) How is it possible not to sin? 2) 
How do we know that we have an Advocate when we 
fall into sin unawares? 3) How then do we know that we 
have known Him in truth? 4) What do we have to do if 
we want to keep his commandments? 5) What must be 
done if the truth is to be in us and we do not want to be 
liars? 6) How shall we know that the love of God is 
perfect in us? John answers: All this does the same one 
word of God, if we keep it. The apostles learned this from 
Christ when he answered the woman who cried out to 
him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts 
that you sucked," "Yes, blessed are those who hear and 
keep the word of God," Luc. 11:27 ff. In the Greek the 
wordwhich 
means such preservation, which is demonstrated by a 
precious and valuable treasure. Whoever keeps the 
word of God in this way does not sin. We have a similar 
combination of so many truths in the 14th chapter of the 
Gospel of John, the main content of which is that we 
should remember the word of Christ. And if it seems to 
us to be a particularly difficult thing to remember the 
word in the hours of challenge, then for this reason the 
Holy Spirit was promised to us by Jesus, who is to 
remind us of it. Whoever has this Holy Spirit also has the 
Word in his heart. Whoever has this word in his heart 
and believes in it is also chosen by God to be blessed; 
but whoever does not have this word and does not 
believe in it is also not chosen to be blessed. 


V. 5. And by this we know that we are in him. 

(9) Up to this point John has taught how we should 
be before God, but now he goes on to show why all this 
is done for the sake of the word and not for the sake of 
other things. 


1) Luc. 11, 28. does not stand but which, by the way, has the same 
meaning. 





V. 6 Whoever says that he will abide in him, let 
him also walk as he walked. 


Paul writes Rom. 8, 1. what this means to be and 
remain in Christ. "So then," it says, "there is nothing 
condemnable in those who are in Christ Jesus," or who 
cry out with earnest desire, "Who will deliver us from the 
body of this death?" Rom. 7, 24. For to those who have 
the Spirit of JEsu Christ in them, by which they kill the 
business of the flesh, and who cry in their heart, "Abba, 
dear Father!" to them, | say, God does not impute their 
sin. 


How he has changed. 


This walk of Jesus is the rule of all good works 
pleasing to God; it is an instruction how to walk properly 
in the world. If John had shown us before how we should 
be before God, he now also teaches how our conduct 
should be before men. The emphasis of this expression, 
however, lies in the word "walk". For the doctrine of the 
works of a Christian is a most important doctrine; he is 
to walk as Christ walked. O! how much a Christian has 
to do there. For here it is called going out and walking. 
When dealing with God, there is no staying inside, 
standing still, and waiting for what God will give us and 
how He will deal with us. In the sight of God, no work or 
life should be valid, nor should we help, but we should 
only fetch and take from God; but in the world we should 
only give, lend, give, help and advise. 

12. Christ has given himself completely with all his 
gifts and benefits to us; so we are also to present 
ourselves to our brothers for service with everything that 
God has given us. John summarized both in the word 
"walk". Paul described it thus in the epistle to the 
Galatians: "Bear one another's burdens, and so you will 


fulfill the law of Christ." But this is a great canon 


poenitentiae. But it is not meant that we should follow 
Christ in extraordinary things, and walk with him as it 
were on the sea. That is far away. But we are to walk in 
the way of righteousness, and pray for our enemies, as 
Christ does. 


1540 


stus, even as he was pinned to the cross, walked in this 
way and prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not 
what they do," Luc. 23:34. Therefore, if you learn from 
Christ to pray even for your enemies, you will walk in the 
ways of the Lord. 


V. 7 My brothers, I am not writing you a new 
commandment. 


(13) This is indeed a dark saying, for here the apostle 
says that he is not writing a new commandment, and yet 
immediately after this he says that he is writing a new 
commandment which seems to be in conflict with one 
another. 

(14) It should be noted, however, that the 
commandment to love may well be called both a new 
and an old commandment. The old commandment is the 
one when the law says: "You shall love God above all 
things, and your neighbor as yourself." And this is truly 
an old commandment, because it does not renew man. 
Therefore the fulfillment of that prophecy is necessary: 
"Behold, | make all things new," Revelation 21:5. But 
such a commandment is also called new, because the 
explanation of the true understanding of it goes further, 
and a new power for the accomplishment of it is given to 
man from above. For this is what Christ, the new 
interpreter of the law, says in Matthew, Cap. 22, 39: "The 
other commandment is like unto it," as if to say, "Abide 
in the world, and love thy neighbor, and give thanks unto 
the Father, which forgiveth all thy sins. But if you cannot 
love your neighbor on earth, do not think that you are 
qualified to enter heaven and love God there. 


V. 8. which is true with him and with you. 


(15) This means that just as He, the Son of God, 
Jesus Christ, voluntarily served His heavenly Father and 
gave Himself for our sake, you also do the same, serving 
others voluntarily, without constraint, without seeking 
human rewards and retribution. 


For the darkness has passed away, and the true 
light now shines. 


16 That is: You now muck out what you are to do and 
why it is to be done. The old 


Interpretation of 1 John 2:6-9, 11. 


1541 


W. ix, 1101-1104. 


was that God at all times commanded us to love Him; 
but now it is something new that by the bright light of the 
Gospel we can also know how to love Him. 


V. 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his 
brother is still in darkness. 


17) "To be in the light" means as much as: to know 
where one is and what one has to do. To "walk in the 
light" indicates that occupation of a Christian that he 
daily becomes better and more and more puts away evil, 
according to the exhortation of Paul Eph. 4:25, 28: "Put 
away lies and speak the truth. He that stole, let him steal 
no more." "Remain in the light" means to be ruled and 
governed by the new leader, of which likewise Paul says 
Rom. 8, 14.: "Whom the Spirit of GOD impels, they are 
the children of GOD." On the other hand, this is called 
"being in darkness" when one does not know where he 
is. And "to walk in darkness" is nothing else than to stand 
in carnal security, not recognizing one's own misery. 
"But to remain in darkness means to be controlled by the 
evil spirit and to be driven into darkness. As John says, 
v. 11: "The darknesses have blinded his eyes." 


V. 11: He who hates his brother is in darkness. 


18 Flesh and blood will object to this and say: 1) 
Every man has a natural antipathy and enmity towards 
some other men. 2) The goods | possess are all mine, 
and | may do with them as | please. - But for this very 
reason God has given me such goods, namely good 
health, skill, temporal ability, that we should thank Him 
for them and serve others with them. 3) Against my 
neighbor who offends me, | may defend myself by right. 
- This is nothing else, 1) as if Christ had endured nothing 
adverse and hostile. He who defends himself brings his 
neighbor into greater bitterness; but he who does this 
also hates him, so that defending oneself is not a right.

| am not allowed to do anything that comes from a hostile 
heart. 4) My wife and children are my neighbor to whom 
| owe everything. - This is nothing else, 1) as if Christ had 
not said Matth. 10, 37: "Whoever loves his wife and 
children more than me is not worthy of me. 5) He to whom 
| do good, does evil to me. He is unfaithful in trade and 
conduct, therefore he is also unbelieving against God. 6) 
Ingratitude and violent oppression and tyranny are very 
contrary to love for one's neighbor. 


The darkness has blinded his eyes. 


With this, John describes the real reason why we are 
not the people we are supposed to be before God and 
man, and what prevents us from being. Satan blinds us 
by his darkness; he seduces us either by our own sins or 
by the evil examples of others. Natural unkindness is the 
source of all offences against our neighbor, and this 
mischief dwells in the heart. Now those whom he cannot 
seduce by their own sins, he seeks to ensnare by evil 
examples of others. To these latter now belongs the 
world, and what is in the world. Therefore the apostle 
does not want us to love the world. 


V. 12. Dear children, I write to you that sins are 
forgiven you through his name. 


20 These words indicate in general that this doctrine 
belongs to all men, to all classes and orders among them. 


V. 13. I write to you fathers, because you know him 
who is from the beginning. 


21. He who is from the beginning is none other than 
from whom all fatherhood comes in heaven and on earth, 
Eph. 3, 15. Now this Father has commanded that for his' 
sake also the fathers on earth should be honored and 
followed. Hatred and enmity dwells in all men, and in all 
among them. 


1) "This is nothing else" set by us instead of: "Not different” in the 
old edition. 





Among children, young men and parents. Young men, 


¢aiayo, are called those who now apply themselves to 
a certain way of life, and choose something with which 
they want to ply their trade in the world. 


Iam writing to you children because you know the 
Father. 

(22) Children, when they are to be instructed in virtue 
and godliness, generally harbor ill will toward those who 
are their parents, or who take the place of their parents 
with them, and show them the right way; therefore, 
forgiveness of sins is necessary for them. If one lets the 
child have its will, it does not cry. Therefore, John here 
inculcates exactly what is written in the fourth 
commandment, namely, that the children should show 
obedience to their parents. And Solomon, Proverbs 1:8, 
admonishes the children that they should not despise 
the discipline of their father, because then God will follow 
with discipline and punishment for the sake of the 
parents. But by nature, children are such that they like it 
when you let them shoot the reins. Youth is no different; 
and though it is held so tightly that it cannot break 
through, yet it grumbles against it. The right of fathers 
over children derives from GOD; "he is the right father 
over all that are called children in heaven and on earth," 
Eph. 3:15. Therefore, even the rule of fathers over their 
children on earth should not be stubborn and unkind. He 
that ruleth wrathfully maketh evil worse. If the fathers 
and masters on earth do not recognize God, God also 
makes that no child and servants will be wronged. 

23 This verse also brings to mind the proper affection 
that should prevail between parents and children. Paul 
exhorts Eph. 6:4: "Fathers, provoke not your children to 
anger, lest they be afraid; but bring them up in discipline 
and admonition unto the Lord." Experience teaches that 
far more can be accomplished by love than by servile 
fear and coercion. This also concerns the masters, to 
whom Paul also reproaches this, Eph. 6, 9, "that they 
also have a Lord in heaven". They should not put 
themselves in God's place, but rather this

consider godly: God must make pious. Parents are 
required first of all to be diligent and careful, and then to 
have a true fear of God. Therefore, they should not try to 
keep the youth in their place with grubs and frightening 
images. It is the duty of children to learn to fear God 
above all things, and also to love those who work to raise 
them. The fear of God must never come out of their 
hearts, otherwise they are unfit for any business, and 
neither God nor man is useful. The discipline that is done 
on children, both by words and by works, saves the soul 
of a child from the eternal punishments of hell. A father 
does not spare ruths, but considers that this honor of 
raising children is given to him by God, indeed, that it is 
God's own work if children are to turn out well. He who 
does not know this hates his children and family, and 
walks in darkness. 


V. 14. [have written to you fathers. 


24 Parents who love their children too much leave 
them with no will to be brave; they basically do nothing 
but hate them. They raise a villain whom they must once 
accompany to the Rabenstein, and who bites off his own 
parents' noses. The parents are commonly to blame for 
the children's ruin. They generally provide it from these 
two sides: either by too much coddling and pampering, 
or by too much severity and bitterness. Moderation must 
be kept on both sides. 


I have written to you young men that you may be 
strong, and that the word of God may abide with you, 
and that you may overcome the wicked one. 


25 In the Proverbs of Solomon, Cap. 30, 18, 19, it 
says: "Three things are too strange for me, and the fourth 
| know not: the way of the eagle in heaven, the way of 
the serpent on a rock, the way of the ship in the midst of 
the sea, and the way of a youth with a virgin. The 
affections and desires of youth are so hot and fierce that 
they are always unstable and cannot decide on anything 
definite; they are like a wheel, one half of which goes up 
and the other down. The fiery tempers want everything 
with the blade. 





and it is almost a miracle that they still grow old. John 
adds, "I have written that you may be strong, and that 
the word of God may abide with you," for otherwise you 
would not sing out your vocation. For where the word of 
God is not, such things cease, and men fall from one to 
another. And the world also hates all those who keep it. 


I have written to you that you are strong. 


But in whom is such strength? In him in whom the 
word of God abides. 


You have overcome the villain. 

This would be quite impossible in itself, especially 
because of the disorderly lusts and desires to which the 
youth is subjected. These make them disgusted with all 
good intentions and advice, whereas they are more 
inclined and ready to accept heated and harmful 
suggestions. They are the more inclined and ready to 
accept them. 


V. 15. Do not love the world or what is in the 
world. 


This saying is very convenient to teach us that the 
sins and vices do not belong to the essence of the world 
created by God, but have been introduced into it by 
Satan. And in these words is a vivid picture of the world 
in trouble. Notice that John does not command: Come 
out of the world, but he only says: "Do not love the 
world." This is also what Paul taught. Whoever did not 
want to have any contact with evil people would have to 
leave the world. Let him who lives in the world be as one 
who does not live in it; let him who rejoices be as one 
who does not rejoice; and let him who needs this world 
not abuse it. To go out of the world is good; but to remain 
in it (and yet keep oneself unspotted from the world) is 
better still. 


If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not 
in him. 
This means that the Father does not love the same 


one who loves the world. A hard blunder! One should 
rather lose a thousand necks.

Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, iios-E. 1547 





V.16. For all that is in the world (namely, 
carnality, lust of the eyes, and hopefulness) is not of 
the Father, but of the world. 


30 This is the world's conterfei; it is a description 


quoad subjectum et materiam. In Scripture, "flesh" 
means everything that is opposed to the spirit. The word 


libido is still too weak to express the apostle's opinion, 
for it includes everything that is good for the body. The 
flesh contends against the spirit. The nature of the flesh 
is to seek what is pleasing to the natural man and to flee 
what is painful to him. To such temptation of the flesh 
belongs all misfortune that a man can conceive, which 
he may also imagine, 1) be it disease, fire, water, 
pestilence, or whatever other names it may have. "Lust 
of the flesh" is therefore called when man strives for all 
the sensible comforts of the flesh, when he does not 
want to freeze and sweat, to suffer any lack of honor and 
good, of abundance. Satan puts the fuse in the heart, 
and then he fills it. But when it fails us, how we rage, 
how we murmur, proving that we belong to the world. 
When we see a rich and distinguished man, we wish: 
Oh, | wish | were like that! Or when those who have 
children wish: Oh, if only | could raise and tax them so 
high and honestly! Now this is a carnal desire. Another 
sees one acting here, acting there, and wishes: Oh, if 
only | could come to that! In such people there is not the 
love of the Father. Others say: Should | not enjoy the 
trade? Likewise: It is mine, | will give it as | will. Those 
who begin to do business and trade in the world are 
wont to say, "We have to pay an apprenticeship! To 
children they say: they should think of the old man. Or 
also: that one must take the soul on one's back until one 
has become rich. But what if you lose your soul and 
Satan gets hold of it? 


1) "imagine may" put by us instead of: "disguise must" in the old 
edition. 





Eye candy. 

31 To such "lust of the eyes" belongs the desire 
either to acquire temporal goods in the world, or to 
maintain and increase the acquired ones. In particular, 
however, such lustful eyes include 1) the insatiable urge 
that is found in the corrupt heart for a loose way of life. 
According to the common saying, this is called: You can 
fill their belly, but not their eyes. For the eyes of man are 
insatiable. No one is happy with his condition as long as 
he sees people next to him whom he considers better 
than himself. Everybody is disgusted by the profession 
in which he stands. He always wants to mean something 
greater and more in the world. 

32. 2) It belongs to this lust of the eye, when one 
looks at others with an envious eye, and does not 
begrudge them their condition. When Cain saw that his 
brother and his sacrifice were pleasing in God's eyes, 
his eye not only became envious, but he himself became 
a fratricide. There are many things in the world that man 
cannot escape. His eye gets to see many rare, new 
things. From it the desire arises with him: Eh! would it 
were also so good for me. Here the eye sees a trade, 
there a field, there a garden, and the heart immediately 
desires to share in them. This desire is often very much 
aroused in children by their parents. Dear child, they 
say, think of the old man. So, too, when they marry, they 
think only of rich houses and families. The divine 
commandment says: A wife comes from the Lord; but 
the eye says: By the staff it is good to leap. Therefore it 
seeks only riches. Now this is a lust of the eye. The love 
of the Father is not with such a one. God is not pleased 
with him, but the world is, and therefore it does not love 
God. 

33. 3) It is to be noted that for the sake of such lust 
for the eyes, much injustice also goes on in the world. 
When a man gets into office, becomes mayor, city bailiff, 
he should administer justice and punish the guilty, but 
protect the innocent. But his eye is then a mischievous 
one. If | punish, he says, | damage my property, 


1548 


Honor, wife and child. Therefore, the eye looks only at 


how it remains with good and honor, be it per fas or nefas 
[with right or with wrong, it goes thereby right or wrong. 

34. 4) It is part of such lust for the eyes, when one 
closes his eyes to all good advice, which the word of 
God as well as the general best gives, and thinks to 
himself: You must also see what people think of you. But 
a true Christian is satisfied, even if the world does not 
think much of him. He says: Lord, you know how | am 
before you. Jeremiah and Paul call this "human days", 1 
Cor. 4, 3, about which a Christian should not worry. 
Such diarists and listeners generally have a double 
misfortune. For when they have heard something that is 
not decent to them, they want to burst. In the courts of 
princes, this eye of the world is very common, which also 
happens when princes and lords attach themselves to 
the mob. Wise men have long since judged that he who 
attaches himself to the mob is not worthy to rule. A wise 
and brave lord does right and does not shy away from 
anyone, even though he cannot lack enemies. The 
authorities are God's order and, as it were, a wall against 
all evil and godless people, and God is within them. 
Whoever dies for the sake of such order, dies well, his 
wife and children will not perish and perish. But such 
popularity is of a threefold nature. First the personal, 
then the civil, third the spiritual. Of the latter, Paul says 
Gal. 1:10: "If | were pleasing to men, | would not be 
Christ's servant." Such a servant of Christ knows 
nothing but Jesus crucified. This concerns the servants 
of the divine Word, and Satan cannot stand it, nor the 
world. Now, because a servant of Christ in this play 
knows nothing of any popularity and human pleasing, it 
soon affects me, soon you. Therefore it is no wonder at 
all if one does not like an evangelical teacher. The 
world's eye wants teachers to be completely pure as 
angels, and complains when they are not. But they do 
not consider that they also 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:16, W. ix, 1112-1114. 


1549 


They have flesh and blood, and can make many a 
mistake. It is said, however, of a teacher: Spartam, quam 


nactus es, adorna, or, do now the office which thou hast 
been charged with; thou shalt not have a scarf's eye. In 
this, too, a poor man who does his part is better than a 
boaster who does not have the bread, or who does not 
faithfully preside over what he is commanded to do. 
Jacob and David are angry in the eyes of others and do 
their part, but Esau and Absalom swarm around and do 
nothing. 

35. 5) Among them are the weak minded, who take 
everything in contempt and cannot look at those who are 
more than them with a good eye. They think that they 
are more capable than all others, and say: | should be in 
their place. They interpret everything they perceive in 
their neighbor as evil: Thus he has walked, thus he has 
stood, thus he has spoken; and everything that he does 
is declared by them to be detrimental. 

36. 6) Among them are those who feast their eyes on 
money, who turn back a penny twice before spending it, 
who make themselves poor because they do not want to 
spend the good money. Not differently, as if between 
coin and coin, between earth and earth, there were such 
a big difference. The eye makes such a difference. 
Investigate your heart in this. For the love of the Father 
cannot dwell in such lust of the eye. 

37. 7) Finally, it belongs to the lust of the eye, if one 
looks so greedily at the supply of food, and either wants 
to save everything, or to make everything money. 
Solomon says Proverbs 22:9: "A loving eye is blessed 
by God"; and he who does good to the poor will never 
go hungry, but will lend it to the Lord, who will repay him. 
But the stingy heart says, "If | have nothing, no one will 
give me anything. But, "He who holds back grain, people 
curse him," Proverbs 11:26. 

38 It is therefore, if one is to put it briefly, a lust of the 
eyes, when one is either not satisfied with one's status 
and strives for a higher status, which unfair desire one 


might rightly call astidium vocationis, a disgust with 
one's profession, or when one wants to give others their 
gifts and privileges. 


1550 Interpretations on the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1114-1117. 1551 


The eye of the man is not pleased with the way he looks 
at us. Against such a displeased eye one must 
remember with a godly heart that Christ, our head, has 
condescended so low to all of us that we may all have an 
equal share in him. Therefore a poor shepherd can say: 
Christ has done enough for me as well as for the emperor 
and for the richest. | am as comfortable in the huts as the 
emperor is in his imperial palace. 


Hopeful Life. 


(39) By this is understood all that in the world is called 
honor, dignity, and prestige. In and of itself, honor is 
nothing harmful. For God Himself loves honor, and not 
shame. But honor is followed by respectability, and 
disgrace by prudence. 1) Therefore, people should be 
brought up to keep honor, discipline and moderation. For 
this reason he has also decreed that those who live 
dishonestly will be punished. How far will he have kept it 
now? So far that he would not become Pilate. As Christ 
says Matth. 10, 37: "Whoever does not love me more 
than father, mother and brother is not worthy of me. Why’ 
does the world not believe in Christ? It is so blinded by 
the conceit of its own advantages that it despises Christ, 
along with everything that belongs to Christ. Pilate does 
not like to have the emperor as an enemy for the sake of 
Christ, because in his eyes he is a great and wise man, 
and for the sake of this title he despises the gospel. The 
best remedy is to remember that Christ died for our sake. 
In the Gospel of John it says Cap. 12, 43: "Therefore they 
could not believe, because they preferred glory with men 
rather than glory with God." 

The following three things are not of the Father: 1) 
hatred of the brethren; 2) the three idols of the world, lust 
of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and hopeful living; 3) false 
and seductive doctrine, as being of Satan. The 


conclusion or enthymema,”) which the apostle makes. 


1) Here, this redaction seems to us to be deficient again. 
2) enthymema, a short conclusion of reason from the 
Antithesis. 





is taken from the loco oppositorum: "The love of the 
Father is not in him". There it says: "The law causes 
wrath", Rom. 4, 15., consequently it cannot make 
righteous. So it is also said here: These three pieces are 
of the world, therefore they cannot be of the Father. 
Likewise: Righteousness comes from the promise, 
therefore it cannot come from the merit of works. 


V. 17: The world perishes with its lust. 


41. Where do we remain? In the will of the Father. 
Therefore, it is immediately added: 


But he who does the will of God abides forever. 


(42) It is clear enough that these words are here 
applied as if they were repeated from a sermon of the 
Lord Jesus. For in that sermon, the will of God was 
indicated with the following words, John 6:40: "This is 
the will of Him who sent Me, that whoever sees the Son 
(who is the image of the divine being and the radiance 
of glory, Hebr. 1:3), sees also the Father," namely that 
He is just as minded toward us as we see that the Son 
is minded toward us. Whoever believes in this Son of 
God has eternal life. But that John says here, "He who 
does the will of God abides forever," belongs to the 
righteousness of faith, which has both a heart and ears 
to hear. Therefore, such faith truly does the law and the 
will of God contained therein. Augustine writes 
beautifully: In corde sunt aures spirituales, quae 
satisfaciunt Deo, externae manus non satisfaciunt. That 
is: In the heart of a believer is found the spiritual hearing, 
which alone satisfies the will of God; the external hands 
are not able to do this. And Rom. 2:13 says: "Not those 
who have the law, but those who do it, will be saved. 

43) The reason why these three kinds of lusts are 
presented here is to show how they are partly in the 
nature of man, but partly were introduced into the world 
by Satan and are still used for seduction. Therefore, 
since Satan has 


1552 


stum, he needed these three lusts, namely lust of the 
flesh, lust of the eyes and hopefulness. Although it is 
rightly said of Christ: "He did no sin", 1 Petr. 2, 22; and 
just as in his mouth no deception was ever found, so 
Christ also tempts no man to sin. But if Christ is tempted 
by these three lusts, the lust of the eyes, the lust of the 
flesh, and the life of hope, it is a sign that these three 
things belong to the nature of the corrupt world, and are 
only used by Satan for seduction. 

God dealt with Christ as He should have dealt with 
sin. We were actually nothing but a curse and sin, 
therefore Christ was made a curse and sin. The man 
Jesus Christ, who was both the Son of God and the Son 
of Mary, suffered for the sake of sin; yes, this one person 
alone, and no other. But how did this happen? God 
knows. It is an article of faith for us. To reason it seems 
inconsistent, but not to faith. Therefore it is a great 
mystery of godliness. If this person were to be divided 
from one another, one would fall into the coarse swarm 
of the Anabaptists, who separate the divinity and the 
humanity of Christ far enough from one another. But if 
they do this with the green wood, what will they do with 
the dry? God was certainly serious about the suffering 
of His Son. 

Satan uses these lusts as a means to make us forget 
how much God loves us. The confirmation that these 
three things, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and hopeful 
life, were not put into the nature of man, but are used by 
Satan for seduction, is sufficiently evident from looking 
at the young children. These are not dominated by such 
lusts, they do not ask what the grain is worth, they do not 
care about any way of life, about goods, honor, 
dominion, food, clothes, but walk around naked in their 
simplicity. Therefore Christ also took a child and placed 
it in the midst of His disciples and said: "Unless you 
become like this child, you cannot enter the kingdom of 
God", Matth. 18, 2. 3.

1553 


Comparison of these threefold lusts with the 
temptations of Christ in the wilderness. 


46. 1) Reason does not want to leave hope in the 
heart, but drives to despair. But Christ overcomes, and 
says: "Thou mischievous one, wilt thou lead me from 
word to bread? The world says, If | have not bread, | 
must ever starve. But faith says: "Even if there is no 
bread, the word is still there. And "man does not live by 
bread alone, but by every word that comes through the 
mouth of God", Matth. 4, 4. 

47. 2) It was a seduction to the lust of the eyes, when 
Satan said to him: Let yourself go down; leave your 
profession. But this is called tempting God. Every man 
shall wait out his profession abundantly. Such a 
command from Satan is even a dangerous profession; 
for if you neglect your ordinary profession and leave it, 
you are in danger of breaking your neck. The world 
generally judges such undertakings thus: This was 
good, and this even better. But Christ overcomes with 
the word: "You shall not tempt God, your Lord", Matth. 
4, 7. For he who tempts God has no faith, accuses God 
of lies, and says in his heart: Fie on you! You cannot help 
me. That is not what GOtt wants. Yes, that is spitting 
under the eyes of God. 

48. 3) The temptation to the hopeful life was 
contained in Satan's request: "All these things will | give 
thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me", Matth. 4, 9. 
With this he carries to him the administration of great 
things in the world. Behold! there lie the countries. So 
whoever prefers great administrations and positions of 
honor in the world to the gospel is worshipping Satan. 
Likewise, whoever holds the favor of the lord higher than 
God's grace and his gospel. 


But he who does the will of God abides forever. 


In the first letter to the Thessalonians, Cap. 4, 3. ff., 
what the will of God is, in the following words: 1) "This is 
the will of God, your sanctification, that you abstain from 
all fornication (as which makes a man quite carnal, his 
body to be used for the purpose of 


1554 


Interpretations of the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1120-1122. 


1555 





(The first is "that no one should overreach his neighbor 
in trade and commerce, for God is an avenger of all 
things.") "That no one overreach his neighbor in trade 
and commerce, for God is an avenger of all things. 2) 
"That no one should overreach his neighbor in trade and 
commerce, for God is an avenger of all these things." 
Trade and commerce must be honest among men, in 
buying and selling; as one means it in the heart, so one 
should speak it. Cicero himself, a pagan, saw and 
presented this justice in buying and selling. One word, 
one man; so | can give it. 3) 1 Thess. 4:13: "But | will not 
restrain you, brethren, from them that sleep, lest ye 
sorrow, as others which have no hope." This is part of 
the Christian's cross. And also in this there must be a 
difference between Christians and Gentiles. A woman 
and a child die, and God takes away what is dear. Now, 
as a Christian, one should not grieve harshly. 


V. 18. Little child, it is the last hour. 


50 This saying contains a reason for admonition, 
which is taken from the nature of time, and is called thus: 
"Little children, the last hour is now here, with which the 
end of the world has also come near; therefore you 
should not love the world, nor what is in the world. Let 
the world be fine; it is a matter of a handful of days. But 
by the last hour he also understands the time in which 
God will take vengeance on the lovers of the world, as 
well as on the despisers of His gospel. John summarizes 
two things. First, he says: The world will pass away, its 
last hour is here; second, he proves it with this: The 
Antichrist has come. But who is this Antichrist? Two 
descriptions of him are given: 1) He who denies the 
Father and the Son. 2) He who denies that Jesus came 
into the world, or, which is the same, he who denies that 
we are saved by the merit of Jesus Christ, but attributes 
such salvation to his own works. 

51: That this last hour has dawned, he proves with a 
strange 


Sign, after he meets first an objection. For this has 
always been a constant and firm opinion that the last day 
will not break unless the Antichrist comes first. After the 
light follows darkness. And this happens not only in 
bodily and civil matters, since war and unrest often 
follow an unsettled peace, but also in spiritual matters, 
so that godliness is followed by carnal prudence, and 
then by those sins that can happen more leisurely in the 
darkness than in the light. In the first letter to the 
Thessalonians Cap. 5, Paul gave good advice 
concerning this last day. Because people are pointed to 
a last day, they want to leave everything behind. But this 
should not be fine. Rather, one should work as if one 
lived forever; and live and be minded as if one would die 
today. If you need a house, build it, even if you know that 
the last day is near. By the way, Paul gave this 
instruction, 1 Cor. 7:29-31: "They that have wives, as if 
they had none; they that buy, as if they had none; they 
that have need of this world, that they abuse it not: for 
the things of this world pass away." So to those who say, 
"| will now become lazy, because the last day is near," 
Paul says, "This is no good. 

52 From Daniel we learn two things about the 
Antichrist: First, that the Roman Empire must first 
become great; second, that when this empire has fallen, 
the Antichrist will be revealed. This Antichrist is called a 
god of Mausim, a god of whom the fathers knew nothing, 
and who will be honored with gold, silver, precious 
stones and jewels; and great honor will be done to those 
who help strengthen this god, and they will become lords 
over great goods, and the land will be given to them as 
a reward, Dan. 11:37 ff. This gives us a picture of the 
kingdom of the Antichrist; it is a kingdom in which gold, 
silver, blades, songs, buildings, golden pieces and 
ornaments will be found. This god cannot advise souls, 
but he can put money in the box. As soon as a man 
reads the scripture, he will easily find the pope, fine 
priests and monks in it. This Mausim is also supposed 


to be rex facierum, a 


1556 


Larva King, be. Why do our adversaries change the form 
of the sacrament? Because they want to make the 
difference between the clergy and the laity even greater. 
It is further said that he shall become strong, have great 
honor, set himself high in the temple of God, and 
everything he does will have happy success. He will sit 
in his place for quite some time and will not be 
recognized; but finally he will be revealed and 
recognized by the doctrine of the devils, which he will 
introduce to propitiate God. For he denies that Christ has 
come into the world, or that one must be saved by his 
grace and mercy. 


Vv. 19. They went out from us, but they were not of 
us; for if they had been of us, they would have 
remained with us, but that they might be made 
manifest that they were not all of us. 

This is actually an occupation [that is, an interjection] 
in which the apostle seeks to prevent both trouble and 
safety. 

54. The annoyance that could have come from this 
would have been this: "They have gone out from us. 
Should so many holy people have erred? Against this 
now this rule is to be observed: See whether these 
people deny the Father and the Son, they may be called 
popes, fathers, concilia, or bishops. If they deny the 
Father and the Son, they are also the Antichrist. 

In the following fourth chapter [v. 2.f.] a rule is given 
for testing the spirits as to whether they are of God, and 
this is truly an excellent place: "Every spirit that 
confesses that Jesus Christ has come into the flesh is of 
God; and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus 
Christ has come into the flesh is not of God. This is 
therefore the right password: JEsus is Christ; JEsus is 
our mediator. So it is not enough to believe that there is 
a God in heaven who created all things, that he had a 
Son who died for us, and that he sent his Holy Spirit to 
us; but it must also be known that all these things are 
done for our sake, and that we must grasp them by faith. 
Of this the schools know 


Interpretation on 1 John 2, 18. 19. W. ix, 1122-1125. 





1557 


teacher nothing. It does not help the Turks if they believe 
only in one God who created everything. Therefore, it 
does not help the pope and his followers to maintain only 
a historical science of it, but we must believe in the God 
who raised Jesus from the dead and anointed him to do 
the work of redemption, that he might be our Redeemer, 
Mediator and Reconciler. 


If they had been ours, they would have stayed with 
us. 


In the church, there is no other way than that good 
and evil are mixed together. The weeds, according to 
Christ's conception, should not be rooted out, but should 
grow at the same time. A paternoster on the neck, and a 
mischief in the heart, is a saying, but also a true saying. 
Likewise: He goes to church a lot, but he is not reformed. 
Why? Because a completely different service is required. 
The outward appearance has been kept in the church, 
but the spirit has been lost. But there is no other true 
service than that commanded in the Gospel. 


So they would have stayed with us. 


That is, they would have remained in the purity of the 
doctrine. In the church there are evil people, just as in the 
human body there are evil and harmful dampnesses. 
Now, as the human body is preserved when the harmful 
moistures are swept out, so also the church when such 
people go out from it. In the church, therefore, good and 
evil are together, and therefore they do not really belong 
to it; just as ulcers and sores are on a body, but do not 
really belong to it. We confess a holy Christian church, 
but the hypocrites and the ungodly are not holy. The 
Church is a communion of saints, a workshop of the Holy 
Spirit in the hearts of believers; consequently, outward 
customs do not essentially belong to the Church. The 
Church is a communion in which the saints stand among 
themselves, for they have God, His Word, Christ and 
baptism. The Church also has its marks, its court color, 
namely the Word of the Gospel and the holy sacraments. 
That is, just as Christ was behind 


1558 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1125-1128. 


1559 





they also have his word and his sacraments, just as he 
instituted them. But whoever teaches and believes 
otherwise about his word and sacraments is the 
antichrist. 

(58) So this is what John said here against the 
offense and against the prejudice: Should so many holy 
people have erred? 


V. 20. And ye have the anointing of him that is 
holy, and know all things. 


(59) Hereby he describes how those who went out 
from them and denied Christ could be discovered. And it 
is to be noted: 


This anointing is from the Holy Spirit. 
The Holy Spirit is the truth. 
3. believers follow this truth. 
4. the truth is further explained with the lie opposing 
it. 
60 The anointing has its intention on JEsum, who 
therefore is called Christ, and has the right xpioua or 


anointing. This ypioud is described by Paulo in another 
place OTEPEOUO Z0- EWG, a fortification of faith, likewise 
TANpooopia, a firm conviction of the 


Heart, 1) called. Paul's otepé0p10, seems to be taken from 
Moses, who thought of a firmament that distinguishes 
and separates the waters of heaven from the waters of 
earth; thus faith sustains the heart, and is a certain 
conviction of what God has promised, that it will not 
depart, even if an angel comes from heaven and wants 
to preach another gospel, Gal. 1, 8. 


V. 22. But who is a liar without denying that Jesus 
is the Christ? This is the anti-Christ who denies the 
Father and the Son. 


With this he describes the lies, by virtue of the 
contrast. In the world there is a double righteousness, 
namely the righteousness of one's own works and the 
righteousness of others’ works. This righteousness 
condemns, but this righteousness makes blessed. 
Tauler writes: We are by grace what Christ is by nature 
and essentially. He is an heir by virtue of his nature, but 
we are by grace. He is an inheritor of life, of the Ge- 


1) Put by us instead of: "a frankness of spirit" in the old edition. - 
"called" added by us. 





righteousness and all blessedness. Augustine has also 
written about it: Another meaning has the name JEsus, 
another the name Christ. In so far as JEsus Christ is our 
Beatificator, it is of course one name. Nevertheless, 
JEfus was his real name, attached in circumcision; as 
the name of Moses, Elijah, Abraham, was proper to 
these persons, so the name JEsus was proper to him. 
But Christ is the right sacrament name, which has the 
greatest meaning, and is as much as if he were called a 
prophet, a priest. Thus Christ is presented to us as the 
only one in whom all Israel shall be saved. John repeats 
this in the following fourth chapter. From this Christ we 
now bear the name Christians; God give with honor. The 
weak must be instructed here, first, from whom they 
have their name, namely, from Christ; then, who Christ 
is; and then they may be safely left to die. 


But this is the anti-Christ. 


62 Then John knocks the bottom out of the barrel. 
Who then is the anti-Christ is evident, namely: 


Who denies the father. 


63. that he sent his son into the world as a savior. 


And who denies the Son. 


(64) That he was sent by the Father to restore us to 
grace through him, or to devise some other means by 
which we may not be received into grace through Christ 
in vain. Here are many opportunities, many impulses, 
against which we should keep ourselves prepared, so 
that we do not fall into Satan's kingdom. 

V. 24: What you have heard from the beginning, 
let it remain with you. If what you have heard from 
the beginning remains with you, you will also remain 
with the Father and the Son. 

65 This is an exhortation to stand firm against the 
aversions. And this whole verse contains a praise of the 
word and what fruit it produces. Our present times are 
dangerous. We have 


1560 


Interpretation on 1 John 2:24, 25. w. ix, 1128-1130. 


1561 





the spirits of the swarm, furthermore the peasant cult, 
further the sacramentirans, and finally the Anabaptists. 
Whoever is not infected by them in our times, may thank 
God. 

There are always three predatory ships moving 
around us. First, our corrupt nature; second, the world; 
third, false teaching. For the sake of these three pieces, 
itis almost dangerous to be in the world. In the third part, 
Satan needs people of great intellect and abilities, whose 
word spreads like cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to 
keep above the Word and pray, so that we do not accept 
the opinion of some people who say: "There is no harm 
in dealing with such people. This delusion corrupts very 
many. There is much harm in dealing with them, there is 
the devil underneath. 

So stay with you. 


(67) Namely, that Jesus is Christ the Beatificator. 


In this way you will also remain with the Father 
and Son. 


68. This is the great benefit you get from it. This is the 
spiritual blessing in heavenly goods. What greater thing 
can be said? The kingdom of God is not in words, but in 
power. It helps in adversity. Judaism says: If you hear 
me, God will not be ungracious to you. Judaism is the 
basis of the law and ceremonies. It also has this great 
promise: "In your seed shall all the nations of the earth 
be blessed." Afterwards the prophets pointed to this 
seed and exhorted: "You shall hear him", over whom the 
Holy Spirit will rest. 

But "to hear" means as much as to uphold the word 
of God. Eve was commanded: "Whichever day thou 
eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die," Genesis 2:17. This 
was a simple command, and she was supposed to stand 
firm. But when Satan came upon her, she did not ask her 
husband, but wavered, doubting. And because she is 


nequaquam to Satan, "by no means", to 

When she hears the word, she falls into idolatry. The 
apple is beautiful to look at in her eyes, and through 
affect she is led further and further away from the word. 
It is still the same for us. Christ has given us the simple 
word; but if we believe in it 


If we do not know and reprove that it might be understood 
this way or that way, we deny God with Eve and become 
inveterate devils. 


This is how you will stay with the Son. 


70. as with which everything shall be given to us. If 
you stay with the Son, you must not worry if you have to 
have the emperor, pope, bishop at your mercy. Some 
think: Yes, where will you stay? 


You will stay with the Father. 


For He has given us all things with the Son. In the 
third chapter, v. 1, it says: "Behold, what love the Father 
has shown us, that we should be called children of God. 
My son had to be begotten from my being; but to you | 
will give eternal life. 


V. 25. And this is the promise that he promised us, 
namely eternal life. 


This is the right fruit that we have from Jesus. 
Everyone is now free to search for the treasures of 
eternal life. To the Timothy Paul writes [1 Tim. 3, 13]: "He 
who serves well earns for himself a good degree"; 
similarly, the great reward that the righteous shall have 
in eternal life is spoken of. In the Law it is written that the 
shepherds should stand before God's face at all times. 
The pope makes this a sacrament, 1) but he is a robber 
of the church, for this was only his intention on the word. 
For as the shewbread must always be in the temple, so 
also the word of God, especially the word of the 
forgiveness of sins, must always be in the temple. He 
who serves God in it acquires a good level of godliness. 
For just as in external sciences there are degrees 
according to which one can increase in them, so there 
are also degrees in godliness. It should taste better, 
learn better, do better over four weeks. Here belongs the 
psalm: "You shepherd Israel, listen, you who shepherd 
Joseph like sheep", Ps. 80, 2. This whole psalm is about 
the word of God. Various parables belong to it. As, 


1) Here, at any rate, the rendering of what Luther said is again 
deficient. 


1562 


The likeness of the man who sold a field for the sake of 
a pearl of great price, that is, the man who disparages 
all that belongs to the world for the sake of the word. So 
also the 119th Psalm. Under the emperor Decio there 
were three young men who did not want to renounce the 
Christian faith. When his governor, who had been 
tormenting the Christians for thirty years, saw the 
insurmountable steadfastness of these, he thought to 
himself: How? if | myself provoked them to such 
steadfastness? Then he was taught the truth and 
became not only a Christian but also a martyr. This is 
the anointing and the seal of the Christians. There are 
more examples of this kind in church history. 


V. 27. As the anointing teaches you everything, it 
is true and not a lie. 


This is a strong word, and teaches us that we are not 
saved by our own merit, but by the grace of Jesus 
Christ. And this makes consciences quite secure. The 
wicked cannot stand in their temptations, but the pious 
are humbled in them, call upon the name of God, and 
so are saved. 


V. 28. And NUN little children, abide with him, 

that, when he shall be revealed, we may have joy, and 
not be ashamed before him in his coming. 
This is a new benefit of faith in Jesus. The time is 
coming when everything will be revealed in judgment, 
just as the heart has been. Then the faithful shall not be 
put to shame when he appears. 





Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, iiM-nw. 1563 


and that suddenly, as it is written elsewhere about the 
future and revelation of Jesus. The saints will say: Yes, 
come, Lord Jesus; but the wicked: Where will we stay? 
As the eagles gather where there is a carrion, so will the 
faithful be gathered to Christ Jesus on the day of the last 
judgment. 


And not become a disgrace. 


75 Which shall be unto all them that have the 
anointing of the word. 


V. 29. If you know that he is righteous, know also 
that he who does right is born of God. 


76. If you know, that is, you know that God is 
righteous, that He loves righteousness and hates all 


unrighteousness. He is also effectively or efficaciously 
righteous in making others righteous. This is the right 
righteousness, not which we have, but which is given to 
us by God. 


Who does right. 


77 This is he who abides in the anointing he has 
received from him. 


He is born of God. 


That is, they have received a spiritual and heavenly 
sense from God. Or, as John 1:12 says, "He has given 
power to become children of God to those who believe 
in His name." Those born of nature also have a natural 
sense and fleshly desires. Now follows another 
description of what actually is God's love, in the third 
chapter. 


The third chapter. 


First of all, this chapter is to be brought into a certain 
main summa according to its content. 1) Initially, it is 
taught that the blessedness of man does not flow from 
the law or from human statutes. And in this example of 
the apostles all those have a pattern before their eyes, 
who have the teaching authority in the church. 


that they should be more concerned to present the 
teachings of godliness to their listeners than to 
persecute the Antichrist and other enemies of the truth. 
This is how John does it. Having recently described the 
corruption of our nature, the lusts of the world and its 
desires, and the nature of the world. 


1564 


When he introduces the Antichrist, he returns to the main 
doctrines of the Gospel. 2) Then, in this chapter, he 
elaborates somewhat on the phrase he used in the 
conclusion of the other chapter: "He who does right is 
born of God. 3) Finally, there is all kinds of teaching and 
exhortation. The teachings must be laid down as a basis 
in the church, and the exhortation must be built upon 
them. The vices must be punished, and the Antichrist 
must also be stripped of his coat of armor. 


Behold, what love the Father has shown us, that 
we should be called children of God. 


2. this is a further explanation of the immediately 
preceding saying, "He is born of GOD." 


V. 11. And this is the message. 


3. namely, one does not have to hate the brethren; 
one does not have to love the world with its lust of the 
eyes, lust of the flesh and [its] hopeful nature; one does 
not have to follow false doctrine, for we are born of God, 
and "the Son of God appeared for this purpose, that he 
might destroy the works of the devil," 1 John 3:8. 


V. 19. By this we know that we are of the truth. 


(4) In this way John meets a sorrow of the mind that 
often comes to pious and faithful people, that they say, 
"Oh, | cannot fulfill these three things as | would like to. 
For this reason, however, one should not lose heart. 


V. 23. And this is the commandment that we 
believe 2c. 


This is the conclusion of the whole chapter. This 
general content gives us the following to consider: 
6. 1) The article of repentance is first of all in it, which 
was very much corrupted by the sophists in the past 
times, and has not been presented so loudly since the 
times of the apostles as in our present times. In this way 
Christ preached repentance, but at the same time the 
apostles pointed to the one who must work repentance 
in us. "Repent," said Jesus, "for the kingdom of heaven 
is at hand. 


Interpretation on 1 John 3:1, 11, 19, 23, W. ix, 1132-1135. 


1565 


has come near", Matth. 4, 17. The law and the prophets 
did not use such language; they did not add such a 
cause of motion. On the contrary, they frighten with all 
kinds of threats and say: If you do what God has 
commanded, he will be merciful to you; if not, he will 
punish you. The prophets also do the same when they 
punish the sins of the people of their time. Only the 
gospel adds the right cause. The law says nothing about 
anything but repentance, but the gospel adds this cause, 
Luc. 24:26: "Did not Christ have to suffer, and so enter 
into his glory," so that repentance and forgiveness of 
sins might be preached in his name under all heaven? 
This is the right cause that makes us well pleased to be 
godly and to have our hearts changed, "for the kingdom 
of heaven has come. This cause makes us penitent, but 
also comforts us with the forgiveness of sins. The law 
cannot and may not do this; it does not give comfort. 
Nevertheless, the law must also be preached. But what 
the reason for the movement contains: "The kingdom of 
God is at hand," Christ declared in Matth. 11, 5: "The 
dead rise, the lepers are cleansed, the blind see, the 
lame walk. Therefore, | must now both take other 
thoughts from God and lead a different life. For the 
kingdom of heaven has come, and the love of the Father 
has been revealed. Thus it is said in Rom. 12, 1: "I exhort 
you by the mercy of God to present your bodies for a 
sacrifice that is living, holy, and pleasing to God." Since 
you now know what love God has shown us, you in turn 
show God that which is pleasing to Him. In this way, God 
enters into our lives, and we in turn show it by loving our 
neighbor. 

7. 2) Secondly, John has here given an example to 
all teachers in the church, how they should base the 
doctrine and build the exhortations on it, or, which is the 
same, that they should first teach how we are to be 
saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ alone. 


1566 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1135-1137. 


1567 





The following is a reminder of sin and an exhortation to 
do good. This is what John did in the previous chapter, 
and he presented three kinds of vices: 1) common, 
natural vices, revenge, hatred, anger; 2) prevailing 
worldly vices, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, 
hopefulness. Satan is a right master to hang us in the 
world; 3) false, seductive teachings, for the spreading of 
which Satan generally needs the most skilled people. If 
he cannot weave them into the lusts of the world, he 
makes them full of spiritual pride, full of high thoughts of 
themselves, thus making them antichrist. He makes 
them sure that they think to themselves: "You have 
better gifts than others, you can help yourself greatly 
and seek help from God. You are a master of the 
Scriptures. This certainty is with many the cause of their 
seductions, which many of our new prophets have 
experienced, whom Satan has harmed by not staying 
with the Gospel. So also the pope did not care about the 
word, but says: Ei! the church is more than the word. 
Therefore, they follow their own thoughts, and from this 
the many monasteries and orders have arisen. These 
are the three things with which Satan rules in the world, 
namely hatred and persecution, the lusts of the world, 
and false teaching. John has now also presented these 
three things, but immediately returns to the teaching of 
faith, which is done in this third chapter. The vices, 
however, must be punished. "For God's wrath is 
revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness", 
Rom. 1, 18. But the gospel alone instructs the 
forgiveness of sins. Keep your heart against the gospel, 
and you will repent. For example, the words of Christ, 
Matth. 11, 28: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are 
heavy laden," are a true gospel, for it sets the goodness 
of God before our eyes. But you do not believe this when 
God sends you a cross and lets a wheel run over your 
leg. But as soon as one calls Christ, repentance stands 


at the door. Augustine answers a bishop in his book de 
catechizandis rudibus, and says that there is a twofold 


love: 1) The love of God toward us; 2) our love toward 
the 





Next. That bishop objected and said, "Should | preach 
no more than this, the people will go wild. Augustine 


answered: Dominus praeparabit corda, GOD will already 
prepare the hearts. Therefore, whoever leads the 
teaching ministry, let him remember that he sits or 


stands before God's face, that he is only a statua 


Mercurialis, a hand on the road that shows the way to 
travelers. For a teacher should know that he is not the 
one who edifies and comforts souls, but God does it 
through his word. But our affections must not be mixed 
with this word. 


V. 1. Behold, what love the Father has shown us, 
that we should be called children of God. 


With this he explained what it means to be "born of 
God". God has given this grace and revealed it in his 
word. But if he has given it, we have not earned it. To be 
born of God, then, means to have God as our Father, 
who has accepted us in grace for Christ's sake. If God 
wants to settle accounts with us, He owes us nothing but 
hell, and does so justly. But if he gives us heaven, it is 
grace. Behold, he says, what God has done for us. The 
world looks only at the emperor and other great lords. 
But God does not inquire, as he who redeemed us "not 
with gold or silver, but with the precious blood of Jesus 
Christ", 1 Petr. 1, 18. 19. "What good is it for us, if we 
could win the whole world?" Matth. 16, 26. And with what 
fear the temporal things, honor and goods of this life are 
left! A Christian does not have to say: Ei! this is a 
delicious, fine God, because he gives. But because 
temporal goods are held in such high esteem, one 
should rather say: "Behold, what love the Father has 
shown us in that we should be His children. Paul 
explained what this means in Romans 8:17: "We are to 
be heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Now 
see if this is not a sufficient reason to abstain from the 
three vices described above, which are found in our 
nature, in the world and in false teaching. But just as 
nothing is more easily forgotten than good deeds, so it is 
with us humans 


1568 


even with the blessings of God, so that we forget them 
soon enough. He gives us our being and life, he 
preserves us wonderfully in our mother's womb. When 
man comes into the world, he comes, as Cyprian says, 


ex Officina Dei, from the workshop of God, and finds 


duo ubera [two breasts], two bottles of milk for his 
entertainment. But above these benefits comes this, that 
he gives them his son. This love is described by Paul in 
Romans 5: It is not enough for him to give us bread, 
wine, and money; but in this he shows his love most of 
all, that he dies for his enemies. For the sake of good, or 
for a good cause, a man would rather die as an example, 
a father for his son, a mother for her daughter, a citizen 
for his fatherland. But of this there is no example, that 
ever an enemy died for his enemy; rather he says: He 
who saves his enemy builds up misfortune for himself. 
But Christ dies for his enemies; therefore this is the right 
preaching of faith, and of the grace of GOD. "Now all the 
prophets testify of this JEsu," Apost. 10:43, through 
whom "men have received power to become the children 
of God," John 1:12. If, for example, | come to a man 
whom | do not know myself, but | know his son, and | say 
to the father that | know his son, he says, "Do you know 
my son? well, then | will do you good, because you know 
my son. It is the same with the faith in the name of the 
only begotten Son of God. If | confess his name in faith, 
then this is the cause that | can bring before the Father, 
and for which | am accepted with grace. Therefore it is 
said in John Cap. 3:18: "He that believeth on the Son 
shall not be judged." If | say to the Father, "Dear 
heavenly Father, | know your Son," he answers, "Come 
here, | will show you mercy for the sake of my Son. But 
the world does not know this Son, and therefore it does 
not know the Christians. We learn from experience that 
the world overlooks all vices and bad habits, if only we 
do not know about Christ. And even if one has done all 
the sensible good in the world, and he preaches Christ 
in the process, all that is good in the world is not good in 
the world.

in vain and lost. Peter exhorts: "Let no one among you 
suffer as a thief or a murderer; but if he suffers as a 
Christian, honor God in such a case," 1 Petr. 4:15, 16. It 
is quite evident that the Elector of Saxony never did 
anything against honor, but because he confesses 
Christ, he is rejected and subject to much danger. 


Therefore the world does not know you, for it does 
not know him. 


9 The world follows its evil desires and thinks you are 
fools to put yourselves in danger for the sake of Christ. It 
knows nothing of the love the Father has shown us in 
calling us his children. 


Beloved, we are now God's children, and what we 
will be has not yet appeared. But we know when it 
shall appear that we shall be like Him, for we shall see 
Him as He is. 


(10) That John says, "We are now the children of 
God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be," 
seems to be a dark mystery. It seems to contain a 
contradiction when the Scripture calls those children of 
God who are by nature children of wrath and of the devil, 
and that it assigns God as a Father to those who are in 
the midst of their enemies in great distress. In spite of 
this, it remains the same: we are God's children, heirs 
with all the angels and the elect. But where is this found? 
"The ones the Lord loves he chastises", Hebr. 12, 6, and 
that is a hard distemper that hurts very much. 


But it has not yet appeared. 


(11) So it must be expected in the future with joyful 
hope. Our knowledge in this life is piecemeal; but when | 
have been recognized, only then will imperfection cease, 
only then will we be like him; consequently we must be 
unlike him in this life, because we cannot understand 
what is to happen in the future. 


Because we will see him as he is. 


12 Only then, according to the promise of Christ, will 
we be like the angels of God, Matth.

22, 30. We find a beautiful explanation of this place in 1 
Cor. 13, 12: "Now we see it through a mirror, in a dark 
word." A riddle is a dark speech that consists of words, 
but whose true meaning must be guessed. It says: 
"Counsel, what is this, that he who is up to his ears in the 
cross and suffering should be God's child? It is a dark 
word, a riddle. The whole world is misled by it, it cannot 
solve it. For the world says of such a one: He is a child of 
the devil. But Christ has solved this riddle. For he himself 
was the Son of God, even though he was tested and 
exercised in the cross. Therefore, Christ pressed the seal 
on this truth on his cross. We see it as through a mirror; 
Jacobus has resolved this expression for us in his epistle, 
Cap. 1, 23. 24. It is the way of a mirror that one soon 
forgets what one sees in it. Thus it is said there: "The wind 
blows where it wills. John 3:8: No one knows of this 
filiation from a special divine revelation, but only from the 
inward movements of his heart through the Holy Spirit. 
But where they come from and where they go, he does 
not know. So we are promised an inheritance, but only in 
a mirror, so that we soon forget it. It is like a dark word 
that cannot be completely dissolved; therefore, our hope 
must wait for it and be sure that it will come one day 
Epicurus writes: Soes mea sit in fundo, my hope goeg 
no further than my eyes can see. Homerus wrote 
Noxam esse in mundo, sin der Welt sei‘j Herzeleid 
Jammer, und dergleichen, und Jupiter soll die Welt von 
dieser noxa, befreien. Virgilio says: Durate, et vosmet 
rebus servate secundis,') endure, and expect a better 


fortune. Dabit Deus his quoque finem, finally the 
misery will have an end. But a Christian exclaims, "Abba 
dear Father." This riddle is well expressed in the isdend 
of St. Francis. For when his brothers praised him greatly 
and singled him out, he said, "| am a child of the devil; 
have death and hell. 





1) Virgil, Ub. |, v. 207. 





deserves. This is not what the pope says nowadays, nor 
what any pope says. 


We are now God's children. 


(13) In truth, this remains a mystery and a dark word 
to the pious. For nothing is less obvious to the children 
of God in this world than that they should be children of 
God, that is, lords of death, hell, sin and all creatures. In 
this world, they are regarded as sheep for slaughter, 
which must necessarily be removed from the way. Of this 
we have the beautiful saying of Paul to the Colossians, 
where it says: "Your life is hidden with Christ in God", Col. 
3, 3. 

14. 1) For first of all, the saints still feel that there is 
still vain sin and corruption in their flesh, so that it is not 
often that they lose heart, or stand before God with a 
sorrowful heart and pray, "O Lord, do not enter into 
judgment with your servant, for before you no living 
person is righteous," Psalm 143:2. 143, 2. A child of God 
says in the morning, "This whole day | want to serve God; 
but before he realizes it, he falls into sin up to his ears. 
When he then becomes aware of his fall into sin, he says: 
Because it does not want to go on, the matter would soon 
come to pass that | would say: Only a knife here, rope, 
fire, water. And this would also happen if it had no 
consolation for itself. But this consolation is called: You 
are God's child; but it has not yet appeared what a 
blessed state this is. Some have sought this consolation 
in the desert and wasteland, but have not found it, nor 
have they been reformed. In all our flesh there remains 
self-love, or great distrust of God, but firm trust in one's 
own good works. In addition, there are all kinds of lusts 
and desires that would rather have their bridle cut than 
to have it so strictly tightened. And yet this is the purpose 
and desire to which they aspire, that they long to be 
delivered from the body of this death. And this is the 
testimony of the Holy Spirit, "who bears witness to our 
spirit that we are the children of God," Rom. 8:16. 

15. 2) On the other hand, the from-

1573 





In this life, we are still subject to many dangers, which 
Augustine thus presented: Aut sumus, aut fuimus, 


aut possumus esse, quod hic est, we are either still, 
or have been, or can become again, what this is. For 
there is no calamity in the world that does not hang over 
the head of the pious, especially if God should allow it. 
It is very easy for one to fall into all kinds of disgrace and 
vice, adultery, death, fire, water, sword, pestilence, 
disease and all kinds of reproach before the world. In 
addition, there are Satan's manifold wiles, by which he 
seeks to deprive us completely of all grace and 
blessedness. 

16. 3) Thirdly, believers often need to take part in the 
danger of their friends and other people in the world. For 
things do not go right anywhere. Countless blasphemies 
against God and His gospel are uttered by the wicked, 
who deny that the blood of Christ has sufficed for all the 
sin of the world. They force others to participate in all 
kinds of idolatry, to make sects, to establish orders, to 
join the community of the papal tyranny and the family 
of the Antichrist. Satan is the god of this world; it shall 
have no better ruler, for it is not worthy of any better. 

17. 4) The believers and saints must see in this world 
the false prophets, the false brethren, Jews, pagans, 
Sacramentans, deceivers, Anabaptists, and who may 
name all of the swarming spirits. And so the life of true 
Christians is also hidden in God in that they hardly know 
how to survive in the face of so many dangers, 
temptations and changes. And they would not be able to 
do so if they were not children of God, if they did not 
belong to the Church of God and to the congregation of 
the saints, in which all their sins are abundantly forgiven 
every day; if God Himself did not watch over them and 
defend them in danger for the sake of His Christ, whom 
He has given as the head of His Church. 

18. 5) Finally, let each one consider for himself how 
his life has been from the day he began to live. 


think back once, in how many dangers he has been, both 
in the field and on the journey, as well as in his home, 
both in waking and in sleeping, both by day and by night. 
Experience will teach him that it would not have been 
possible for him to exist where he had not been a child 
of God. In addition, when we make many decisions, we 
must learn that it does not depend on what we want and 
decide in our lives, but that God governs everything we 
do, and that even if we leave everything to God, it does 
not always happen according to our wishes and will. 
Therefore, Paul rightly said: "Faith is not for everyone", 
2 Thess. 3, 2. Nothing higher can be created and 
communicated by God than a believing heart. And when 
a new heart is created and a sinner is converted to God, 
it is just as much as if a new world is created. 

19 The experience of this is found in the 139th Psalm: 
"Lord, you search me and know me. And it goes to teach 
how God shows Himself gloriously in the weakness of 
His children. He teaches how man in his mother's womb 
is So wonderfully formed, preserved, nourished, and at 
the right time brought forth into the light. Some have 
taken it upon themselves to look into this mystery of 
nature. But they should rather go back to their youth, 
then they would find what a raw, wild life they led, what 
heated, dangerous plans they made, how many an 
apparent danger they escaped, then their skin would 
probably shiver. 

20. 6) All this, which belongs to the state of suffering 
of the children of God, is described in detail in 2 Cor. 6, 
4: "In all things we prove ourselves to be the servants of 
God, in great patience, in afflictions, in hardships and in 
anguish. This is also what the bride says in the Song of 
Songs, Cap. 1, 5, 6:"| am black, but beautiful, for the sun 
has burned me." And in the 132nd Psalm, v. 13, 14: "The 
Lord hath chosen Zion, and hath pleased to dwell there. 
This is my rest forever; here | will dwell, for it pleases 
me." The church and children of God are

like a widow, and not unlike the one who is completely 
consumed by hunger, and has this for comfort: "The 
Lord is the poor man's refuge, a refuge in trouble. 
Therefore hope in thee, they that know thy name; for 
thou dost not forsake them that seek thee, O Lord," Ps. 
9:10, 11. The same is found in the 45th Psalm, "My heart 
maketh a beautiful song," 2c., vv. 11, 12. "Forget thy 
people and thy father's house, and the king shall delight 
in thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship 
him." Add 

21. 7) The various examples, which are distinguished 
in the holy scriptures. This is how the pious Abel lives; 
this is how Lot is preserved, while the other Sodomites 
go to hell; this is how Noah swims on the waters of the 
flood; this is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ lives, 
dies and rises from death. In sum, this is how all the 
saints live. 


V. 3. And every one that hath such hope. 


(22) That he might one day see God and Jesus as he 
is, which has not yet appeared. 


He purifies himself just as he is pure. 


We all have to study this for the rest of our lives. The 
word: "He who purifies himself" does not mean in the 


Greek text: KABapIGW, | make him clean. 
pure, or KA8aPOc, mundus, but it means: 


Gyvifw, and is used of the removal of such 
impurities and defilements that are an abomination in 
God's eyes and provoke Him to anger in such a way that 
land and people perish and perish under them. This is 
what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah because of 
their abominations. The first world was destroyed by a 
flood of sin because of its abominations. And that Mr. 
Winkler, preacher at Halle, is strangled, 1) that is also a 
pi aculum [a guilt], of which the earth is not yet cleansed. 
For where murder is committed, and the earth is not 
cleansed of such shed blood, a country shall perish. 
Therefore, if a Christian realizes that for his sake a land 
should perish and be destroyed, where he has

not purified himself, he exerts all his diligence to become 
pure; namely. 


How he is pure. 


(24) For he is now reconciled, sin and iniquity are 
taken away from his sight; Christ has taken the curse 
upon himself, for otherwise we would all have gone to 
hell. 

(25) In addition to the epistle written by Paul to the 
Romans, in which the death of the flesh is treated very 
seriously, we also find in the fourth and fifth chapters of 
the epistle to the Ephesians, and in the fourth of the 
epistle to the Philippians, a beautiful instruction as to 
what is the right baptism and purification of life. 

26. 1) The first Canon poenitentiae, or rule, 
according to which the repentance of a Christian and the 
death of the sinful flesh must be established, is this: that 
he may walk worthy of his calling; that he may know and 
consider that he has received his calling from God. What 
this calling is, Paul explained in parts, when he says: 
"Christ has made some apostles, others evangelists, 
others shepherds and teachers", Eph. 4, 11. 
Furthermore, he commanded the wives to love and 
honor their husbands, the children to be obedient to their 
parents, and the servants to show all due loyalty to their 
masters. 

27. 2) The other canon is that each one should 
earnestly endeavor not only to begin the appointed 
course, but also to complete it with all patience, 
gentleness, and forbearance, and that each one should 
learn to bear the other. This is what Paul called tatr“vo- 


~pwotvnv and PlAoOTOpYiaV. Elsewhere says 

This apostle, Rom. 12, 15: "Be glad with the glad and 
weep with the weeping. The gospel not only teaches 
this, but also gives power and strength to do so. The 
Word of God purifies the naturally impure heart. "From 
the days of John the kingdom of heaven suffers 
violence, and those who do violence to it snatch it away," 
Matth. 11, 12. No one can do anything about this unless 
he has this Spirit of Jesus. 

28. 3) The third Canon is: "that we do not 


1576 


walk as the rest of the Gentiles, in vanity of mind, whose 
understanding is darkened, who are alienated from the 
life that is of God, because of the ignorance that is in 
them, because of the blindness of their heart", Eph. 4, 
17. 18. Now we are not to have such a Gentile mind 
about us anymore, nor are we to pull on the same yoke 
with the unbelievers. Paul describes Eph. 4, 19. these 


people as A7MNAYNYOTEG, that is, as those who have lost 
all feeling, or, as Jerome explains it, who no longer know 
what it means "to be ashamed," who live like the 
Epicureans, or like our rich merchants. When you 
punish them, they say: What is the word to me! If | have 
enough here, | will let our Lord God have his heaven. 


These are the Q7TTNAYNXOTEG, the wicked, unfeeling 
people. 
Terentius calls them perditos homines, qui 


dedoluerunt, whom nothing more hurts in their 
conscience. Virgilius describes such a despiser no 
better than the peasants who ask neither for God nor for 
His heaven, who say: "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow 
we will be dead", Is. 22, 13. 1 Cor. 15, 32. The Pope of 
Rome knows nothing of this repentance, and those who 
are of his part are also abundantly provided for: that if 
my son becomes a priest or a monk, he is provided for, 
or my daughter a nun, she is also provided for. 

29. 4) The fourth canon is: that a true Christian must 
have certainty and conviction of his faith doctrine, and 
not, like children, "be swayed to and fro by every wind 
of doctrine", Eph. 4, 14. When Ludwig Hetzer, ') the 
supreme leader of the enthusiasts and Anabaptists, was 
caught in adultery, and was now to receive his due 
punishment, he gave two more teachings. For he called 
to him one who had been a fine follower until then, and 
said: 1) They should not accept any teaching where they 
were not certainly convinced of the truth of it; and this 
was a word for the listeners. 2) That they should also 
beware of teaching others doctrine which they did not 
know to be true. 


1) Hetzer was executed on February 4, 1529. - Cf. Tischreden, 
cap. 43, § 163, Walch, St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, 1199. 


Interpretation on 1 John 3, 3. W. ix, ii48-nsi. 1577 


And this was a word for the servants of the gospel. And 
it is well spoken. For no one can remain steadfast in his 
profession unless he is confident that the doctrine he 
professes is similar to faith. If such a teaching points the 
heart to God, it is right. 

30. 5) The fifth canon is: That in all our life we beware 
of all pretense, and speak the truth every man to his 
neighbor from the heart, according to the admonition of 
Christ: "Let your speech be yea, which is yea; nay, which 
is nay", Matth. 5, 37. And Paul adds the cause: "For we 
are members one of another", Rom. 12, 5. The whole 
world lies in vanity and lies. The buyer and seller speak 
differently with their tongue than they think in their heart 
when they want to buy or sell something. And this has 
now become an honor in the world; when people can run 
with the Jew's spear, they still boast of their deceit, and 
rejoice in it. Listen to what a heathen said about buying 


and selling: Si ad eloquendum venerit, semel 


eloquatur: One should sell with one word. You say, 
"Well, then | should perish. But who says so, he shows 
that he loves the danger. But if you believed God, and 
said all at once how you would leave it, God would be 
good for your loss, and you would sell your things with 
advantage; for He cannot deny Himself. Therefore, this 
is not a true excuse that is given, and it does not belong 
to prudence in buying and selling. But he who has not a 
better hope, of which John speaks, does not cease from 
these lies. 

31. 6) The sixth canon is: that we should not be 
indignant with the wicked, when we see that God 
nevertheless lets them succeed in this world. There are 
many admonitions about this in the Proverbs of 
Solomon, as well as in the 37th and 73rd Psalms of 
David. In the latter it says, v. 2 ff.: "| would have almost 
slipped when | saw that the wicked were doing so well, 
and had great happiness on earth, and were not in 
misfortune like other people. But this very psalm also 
gives the most powerful comfort. 


1578

1579 





32. 7) The seventh canon is: that we do not walk idly 
here in this world, but each one in the profession in 
which God has placed him. God has placed him in. 
Therefore Paul explains to the Ephesians Cap. 4, 28. the 
seventh commandment: You shall not steal, but work. 
For not to work is already as much as to steal. Not only 
the one who takes someone else's goods, but also the 
one who does not work enough to give to the needy, is 
subject to divine judgment, and they will accuse him at 
the last day. He who does not work reviles God's 
creatures, hands, feet, and what God has given him for 
this purpose. But now there are many people in the 
world who are not particularly poor, and therefore do not 
work until they are forced to do so by need and hunger; 
and when they are forced to do so, no one does the 
same. On the other hand, it is God's will that one should 
work, even if one does not need it so much. But those 
who feast, who splurge, who do great things, are 
thieves, for they give nothing to the needy. 

33. 8) The eighth canon is: "Let no idle talk proceed 
out of your mouths, but that which is lovely, that which is 
delightful," and serves to edify your neighbor. For where 
this is not done, the "Holy Ghost is grieved, by whom we 
are sealed unto the day of our redemption,” Eph. 4:29, 


30. Among the Gentiles the eutpatreAia, urbanitas, was 
a virtue, possir, jest; but Paul forbids it to Christians; they 
are to speak nothing that is not pertinent to the matter; 
what does not edify the neighbor is to be omitted. 

34. 9) Finally, it says: "Let all bitterness, and wrath, 
and anger, and clamor, and blasphemy be put away 
from you, with all malice," Eph. 4:31. This applies to the 
fathers of the house and the rulers, who do not deal 
cleanly with the people, so that they deal with them. A 


true Christian looks at this ninefold canon of Paul and 
learns from it how he should purify himself from all 
uncleanness and think, "Oh, should a whole country 
perish and be destroyed for my sake? 

v. 4: Whoever commits sin also commits 
injustice, and sin is injustice. 
35. he commits a praevaricationem, or deviation from 
the law. It is this one 





of the most serious sayings in John. John speaks 
against certainty and against those who imagine that 
they believe. Satan seeks to take hold of the body and 
soul of man, and even does not spare the saints. 
Therefore, it is a great thing about faith that Paul says of 
it that "it is not for everyone", 2 Thess. 3, 2. For this 
reason, we must "work out with fear and trembling to be 
saved", Phil. 2, 12. Paul knows well what danger is 
connected with security. Safety preceded Pabstism and 
all other heresies. Those who let themselves be 
seduced by the pope will be punished less severely than 
those who are safe under the wrath of God. God has 
kept it this way from the beginning: those who have 
become safe or sluggish have been given a good 
beating. St. Thomas Aquinas used to say that he had 
never been tempted, so he was not able to comfort as 
St. Jerome. In our days, people boast that they are not 
unjust, thieves, murderers, and so on. 


He who commits sin also commits wrong. 


(36) All men are gathered together under this saying. 
For they either sin openly and have gross vices in 
themselves, or they harbor evil inclinations in their 
hearts and thus do not satisfy the law. Therefore, those 
who either transgress the law of God and sin openly, or 
who have an unclean heart, are called "sinners". And 
with this he looks back to a previous saying, Cap. 1, 8: 
"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and 
the truth is not in us." "For the flesh always lusteth 
against the Spirit," Gal. 5:17; the corrupt sense of the 
flesh easily leads us captive. Therefore, those who do 
not trust God or fear Him as they should, do not do what 
is proper for the saints to do. They therefore have cause 
to pray: Forgive us our trespasses, and do not enter into 
judgment with your servant. Paul says of himself, 
"Though | am conscious of no evil, yet therein am | not 
justified," 1 Cor. 


1580

W. ix, N54-HL6. 





4, 4. [In the letter to the’j Romans in the 1st and 2nd 
chapter this is treated very extensively. [Cap. 2, 21: "You 
teach another; why do you not teach yourself? Thou 


preachest not to steal, and thou stealest." Avaptia 
actually means the accomplishment of sin; 
But Avouia is called the deviation from the law, 


comes from and a privativum. But what is to be done in 
the case of such deviation? John again refers to the 
forgiveness of sin and says: 


V. 5. You know that he appeared to take away our 
sin, and there is no sin in him. 

(37) For this reason, then, he appeared, that if we 
despair of ourselves and of our own righteousness, we 
may be justified by his righteousness and made pure by 
his purity. 


V. 6 He who abides in him does not sin. He that 
sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 


38 This is a consequence of the preceding. 
Everything refers to the previous conclusion, v. 3: "He 
who has such hope purifies himself, just as he is pure." 
This is most correctly understood by those who explain 
it according to the rule presented by Paul in Romans 8. 
Everything here depends on experience. For what the 
holy Scripture speaks, it does not speak as if it really 
happens everywhere in this way; or, as the beings of the 


world speak, that it is in fact itself, but that it must be 
begun in this way. It is a certain truth [Rom. 8, 22.] "All 
creatures groan and long with us for the revelation of the 
glory of the children of God"; but it is also a certain truth 
[1 John 3, 2.] "Beloved, we are now the children of God, 
and it has not yet appeared what we shall be." Those 
who imagine that Christians can reach the point where 
everything is fulfilled by them are therefore mistaken, as 
are those who believe that nothing happens at all, that 
nothing is accomplished with the gospel, or that there is 
no church at all. Therefore, some fall into the dishonest 
and careless zeal, and under the appearance of 





of the Gospel introduce a doctrine of works or works 
holiness. In the preceding second chapter, it was shown 
that there are especially six things that belong to the 
conscience of man, and again six that concern soul and 
body at the same time. So long only in the heart the 
dispute is to be found: | would like to be like that, then it 
is not yet lost. But when we begin to become insensitive, 
then it is over. The heart should be so minded: 
Everything that the Scripture says, it does not say as if it 
already is, but that it is beginning to be. The wise men of 


the world make a distinction between est et fieri, to be 
and to become. And this can be used to help the 
consciences and, if they are stupid, to straighten them 
out. In the 16th Psalm, which has the heading: "A golden 
jewel", a fourfold way of righteousness is spoken of: 1) 
The way of the heathen, through philosophy, reason and 
works; 2) The way of the law; 3) The delusion drawn 
from the gospel: He who only believes. ') These three 
ways can plunge man into despair. The fourth and right 
way, however, lies in the psalm mentioned above; only 
in this way can things turn out well. 


V. 8: He who commits sin is of the devil, for the 
devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the 
Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the 
works of the devil. 


40. Do you ask: Who is of the devil? John says, "He 
who commits sin," and knows nothing of righteousness. 
But who is of God? He who has hope in God, that he 
may be cleansed by Him from all his sins. All those who 
are in severe trials are to be comforted in this way. 
Christians do not reach perfection all at once. When they 
have begun, they fall again and rise; they may fall again 
and rise. Faith excludes works, one's own good thoughts 
and advice. This must be said to the stupid consciences. 
But this teaching is of no use to those who no longer 
have any feeling. 


1) That is, those who only believe are well off even if they do not 
live a Christian life.

Dieterich of Bern serves them. 1) Many people of our 
time have the thought in their minds: We don't see that 
people are getting better at preaching the Gospel, 
therefore it is better to establish orders. To prescribe 
rules and laws. To these, however, one must reply: 
Abuse does not cancel out the essence of a thing. 2) The 
more precious a thing is in itself, the greater the abuse 
of it tends to be. The sun must not be abolished because 
murderers, thieves, adulterers sin by its light. And the 
sweetness of wine is not evil because many are tempted 
to gluttony by it. Therefore, the Gospel cannot be blamed 
because such people, who have no feeling left in their 
conscience, abuse it. If you look at all false teachings 
and sects, you will find nothing but the appearance of 
works. Even the. Even the Turks do better works than 
our monks of today, so much so that they do not drink 
wine. Yes, it is better to walk on roses and drink malvasia 
than to lie in ashes and drink water without faith in Christ. 
For in faith in Christ all things are good and useful, but 
apart from Christ there is nothing wholesome and holy. 
So, when we look at our Sacramentans and Anabaptists, 
what else do they do but boast about their works and 
want to make themselves great with their persecutions 
and patience? So also the pope boasts of his works, but 
in doing so he is condemned, for they know nothing of 
the Gospel. 

The beginning of the papacy may be dated soon after 
the death of St. Augustine. For the Roman bishop Leo, a 
very famous man, wrote the first decrees. In the 
beginning, the bishops only wrote letters, giving all kinds 
of advice and comfort to the consciences of the people. 


These Consilia were called by them BouA}, consilium, 


a good counsel. From this 

1) "Dietrich von Bern" is a heroic saga much read in the Middle 
Ages. See R. K6nig, deutsche Litteraturgeschichte (15th ed.), pp. 58, 
90 ff. 

2) We put "S" instead of: "does not cancel the right use of the 
thing". For we have to do here with the proverb: H-usus non tollit 
sudstantiaru. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXII, 579. 





The pope made his bulls from the Greek word BouA/), 


statuta, decreta. But this is not the bishops' office, to 
make laws, conclusions, decrees, but this belongs to the 
emperors, princes and authorities, who must prescribe 
how to live and obey outwardly in the world. The gospel 
teaches about faith in Jesus Christ. Where there is true 
zeal, the heart may break, but they must let it go, 
because it is said that such people's condemnation is 
quite right. Those who know nothing of this doctrine are 
apt to say, when they die, that they have not done this 
and that; but a believer says, "Away with works, away 
with works! Works away, works away! Believe in the Son 
of God, as the thief did on the cross. Christ also died for 
me. 


He who commits sin is of the devil. 


(42) There are various expressions which contain this 
very thing and amount to one thing. For if | ask: What 
does it mean to commit sin, to practice injustice? Or if | 
ask: What does it mean not to see God, not to know God, 
to be deceived, to be of the devil, not to do right, not to 
be of God? | will answer that it means not having hope in 
God, and not purifying oneself for the sake of such hope; 
that is, one who does not repent, who practices only what 
seems good to him, who does not love his brother, who 
follows his natural inclinations and evil desires, who 
loves the world more than God, who still follows works of 
holiness, and thinks of no improvement of life. 

(43) If, on the other hand, | ask, "What then does it 
mean not to sin, to abide in him, to see and know him, to 
be righteous and do right, to be born of God, to do no 
sin? | will again answer correctly that it means: to have a 
hope in him, to purify oneself for the sake of such a hope, 
to abstain from sins for the sake of him who appeared to 
take away our sin, who himself has no sin and is 
righteous, who came into the world to destroy the works 
of the devil; who, furthermore, has not forgiven his own 
sins.

W. ix, nsd-nsi. 1585 





He who loves his neighbor warmly, who has an intimate 
abhorrence of his natural corruption and inclinations to 
evil, who does not love the world with its lusts, and does 
not follow those who teach to be saved by works. 


V. 9. He who is born to God does not sin, for his 
seed remains with him and cannot sin, for he is born 
of God. 


44. here is one to be found . He 
calls the ground of our change a seed, not a complete 
ear of grain, or large quantity of grains that can be 
looked at with the eyes, but which is thrown into the 
earth, and there must first die; from this now arises the 
right repentance, that therefore it is said, "He cannot 
sin." For God does not impute sins to such a one; 
indeed, even if he has sin in himself, it must bring him 
more benefit than harm, according to the saying of the 
apostle, "To those who love God, all things must be for 
the best," Rom. 8:28. And this is the right seed that 
dwells in the hearts of believers, that they cannot sin, for 
they are born of God. By virtue of this seed the spirit in 
him contends against the flesh, Rom. 8. And even if he 
is now and then shocked by the wrath of God, by death 
and by judgment, he cannot be attacked by it to such an 


extent that he should fall completely. It is still spes in 


fundo with him,”) he doubts now and then, but he never 
despairs, because the desire remains in his heart even 
under the height, length, breadth and depth of the cross. 
This cross is very salutary and useful for the saints, but 
it is not a teaching for the flesh. This is very pleasantly 
illustrated in that booklet which has the title: "The 
German Theology." In the hour of temptation, all good 
thoughts and imagination of good works disappear; 
nothing remains but the seed. The Holy Spirit alone 
explores the hidden things of the

He bears witness to our spirit that we are children of 
God," Rom. 8:16. Therefore, man has sins in himself, 
but they are not imputed to him; and because the seed 
of God remains in him, he does not sin willfully. 


For he is born of GOD. 


45 By this his saints will know that they are born of 
God. There God said to Moses: "From behind you shall 
look after me", Ex. 33, 23. When you will be saved from 
adversity, then you will also realize that God has been 
near. Therefore, those who are exercised in crosses and 
trials are God's children.

of God and which are the children of the devil.

V. 12. Not like Cain, who was of the wicked, and 
slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because 
his works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 

48. His works were evil, he had no hope in God, and 
did not purify himself for the sake of it, but followed his 
natural hatred and hostility, which Satan increased by 
seeing that his brother Abel was preferred to him by 
God. His brother's works, however, were righteous, for 
he also loved his wicked brother and did not begrudge 
him the gifts that God had given him. 

V. 13. Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the 
world hates you. 

49 For this teaching is something quite unknown to 
the world. 

V. 14. We know that we have come out of death 
into life.

transformed from corrupt, carnal men into new, spiritual 
men.

man has been made. For that is actually to be born of 
God. 


Because we love the brothers. 


This was impossible in the old nature itself, which 
loves no one but itself, and also only for its own sake. 


He who does not love his brother remains in death. 

This is a firm word, a right saying of the Christians. 
One who does not love his brother does not feel the 
movements of the living and life-giving spirit in his heart. 

V. 15. You know that a man who is slain does not 
have life abiding with him. 

For he lives only a short time, and this life of his is 
also a constant dying. 

By this we have known love, that he laid down his 
life for us; and we also should lay down our lives for 
the brethren. 

(54) Likewise, he who has a house, a farm, friends 
and goods should not look at them for the sake of his 
brother. For what else has the world but this, that one 
may serve his neighbor? 

V.17. But if any man have the goods of this world, 
and see his brother brought to nought, and shut up 
his heart to him. 

55. does not take care of him as he should. 

How does the love of God stay with him? 


(56) That is, how can he have the conviction in 
himself, or boast to others, that he is a believer and loved 
by God? 


V. 18 My little children, let us not love in word nor 
in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 


Here, too, note the phrase: Scriptura loquitur de 
fieri, et non in facto esse, Scripture speaks of what is 
supposed to happen, but not of what does happen. 
There are now’ various’ sects, Anabaptists, 
Sacramentarians, all of whom boast of an extraordinary 
holiness; but if they are to be judged according to this 


If they are examined by a probir stone, they are as much 
as nothing. For if something bad happens to them, they 
are not so powerful that they should not become 
extremely angry about it. Therefore it is necessary to 
reproach them from John with this characteristic, namely 
love. If my brother has sinned against me, | must forgive 
him and remember his offense no more. John therefore 
abandons the love with which we love God, and 
demands instead that love which we owe to our 
neighbor. If you believe that you are loved by God and 
that God cares for you, then prove it. Are you able to 
bear, to endure, to consider as good all that befalls you 
from your neighbor? If your heart is like this, everything 
else will flow from it, house, farm, goods, you will share 
them with him. So, so it stands alone quite well. But he 
who is not so minded belongs to the brothers of Cain and 
has not been purified. For where God's love is 
recognized, it works all these things; but where this does 
not happen, we have not recognized it either. 


But how far does it come in it? It is always a fleri, or 
becoming, with them. All believers feel in their hearts the 
good movements of the Holy Spirit. It occurs to them that 
they should keep themselves with eating, drinking, 
walking, standing, so that they do not provoke God to 
anger against themselves, because he has done so 
much good to them. But there are so many blocks and 
obstacles in their way, Satan, the world and our own 
hostile heart, which Satan so incites among ourselves, 
that we easily forget what God demands of us. 


Therefore, this work always remains in fieri. Therefore, 
repentance must also not cease. For the saints always 
sin, therefore they are always in need of repentance. 
Satan attacks man where he is softest, puts all kinds of 
attractive things before his eyes. For he tempts one to 
pleasure and indulgence, another to hatred and enmity, 
another to avarice. Whoever does not hate all these 
temptations is a child of Satan. This is also the case 
when one eats again what he has eaten. If a saint 
commits a sin, he complains to God, and he is holy, his 
seed remains. 


1588 


in him, he is sorry for his fall into sin; he does not sin 
wantonly, and is therefore born of God. But those idlers 
who do not care about their profession, feast, splurge, 
drink, do not need their head, hate their brothers, they 
belong to hell. From this follows the conclusion: that the 
life of a Christian is a perpetual penance. 

The reason for the movement that John gave is 


actually taken a facili Ms One should love the brothers 
because God loved us first. And the example of Cain 
was very suitable for this. Dear heart, consider the sin 
that is often considered the least sinful. If one is 
preferred to us in respect of temporal honor and goods, 
ask your heart how it stands if your neighbor is 
considered better. If then your heart is filled with zeal, if 
in your dealings with your neighbor you pay attention to 
everything he does, if you interpret all his actions in the 
most evil way, ask yourself: Why do | hate my brother? 
Does it not flow from the very source from which Cain's 
hatred for his brother arose? So if your heart swells with 
gall and zeal, and your tongue judges your neighbor all 
wrong, you are a Cain. This is where the little songs 
belong, so that one carries oneself in the world of pious 
people 2): "Maid and servant", 3) they give a sign that 
one does not love one's brothers. But this means to love 
one's brother, if one grants him what God grants him and 
has given him. But a herb soon falls into it, which is 
called suspicio, suspicion. If your brother is preferred to 
you in honor, you think that he does not think well of you. 
Therefore you say of everything he says and does, "He 
does not mean it. This is our attitude toward those who 
are preferred to us. We despise those who are inferior to 
us; they stink to us because they are not as strong in 
faith, love, and hope as we are, or they do not have the 
same courage as we do. When such a lesser person 
falls, there is no one to comfort him. 


1) i.e., of that which is light. 

2) "Of pious people" will probably be as much: of people who 
consider themselves pious. 

3) "Maid and servant" will probably be the beginning of a well- 
known song.

covered. We then easily judge with contempt: "Ugh! he 
deserves it. Who are you, then, to boast that you know 
God? Here it is said: Friends in distress go much to one 
lot. In the same way, if one of those who live at the court 
falls, he is despised by all. There are many examples of 
this. If a lord, a prince, an earl has a hatred for one of his 
servants, then others should be fair enough to comfort 
him and deal with him kindly. But because they are 
afraid that the prince will be angry with them, they avoid 
him and even detest him. So also, if you have a friend 
who does not do something right, you should tell him 
rightly; but you do not do it, fearing his displeasure, and 
so you are a companion of Herod and Pilate. 

(60) It is not necessary to turn to human days, nor to 
ask what others think of us. A saint says: | will do what 
is right, what is good, and what God wants, let him be 
angry. Therefore this remains a final judgment and a 
judicial sentence: "If you hate your brother, then you are 
a slayer of death" [v. 15], and therefore also a child of 
death. 


We have come from death to life. 


For example, if | come into an inheritance, or into a 
trade, and | am harmed, wronged, the rule is this: One 
must love his neighbor. If he is ungodly, he says: | do not 
want to suffer it. But a Christian says, | would have 
brought it out, but it would have become a quarrel; | will 
let it go; but he may well send him two or three, and say 
to him, Thou doest me wrong. If he does not want to give 
himself up, then let his right go. 4) Whoever is able to 
send himself into a situation where he has been 
wronged has a sign that he has come out of death into 
life; God has been there. But whoever gets involved in 
extensive court proceedings, does not want to let it go, 
gets into a lot of quarrels, quarrels, injustice: one may 
not complain about this to God, because one has 
despised God before. And more such examples could 
be given. 


4) So put by nns instead of: "he lets his right go".

Interpretations on the | Epistle SI. Johannis. W. ix, iiss-nM. 1591 





V. 17 But he that hath the goods of this world, and 
shutteth up his heart before him. 

62. What is love? [Is it not to lend, to give, to give? [1 
Cor. 12. The distribution of what one has belongs to it, 
although no law must be prescribed for love. What then 
is love? John says: Open your heart. A pagan can also 
distribute the outward gifts, but his heart is not right in 
doing so. For how can he love God whom he does not 
see, if he does not love his neighbor whom he sees? 


V. 21. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, 
we have a joyfulness toward God. 

There is no place more necessary to preach than this. 
Men are of two kinds: some do that which is pleasing to 
God, and these are those whom their hearts do not 
condemn. Others, however, are just opposed to them, 
whom their heart condemns, and who cannot boast that 
they are pleasing to God. This gives them comfort that 
God is greater than their heart and knows all things. The 
opposite can be found in the history of Cain. He said, "My 
sin is greater than God's mercy," Genesis 4:13, 
"Therefore, if your heart condemns you, say, 'God is 
greater than my heart. 


V. 20. So our heart condemns us. 

This is when it convinces us that we are guilty of all 
sins before God and have transgressed all of God's 
commandments. 


Thus, God is greater than our heart, 

Which condemns us. Only let your shame rise from 
your heart. God is far greater and more forgiving, and 
has no desire to destroy us for our sins. And is the real 
opinion this: GOd is greater than our sin. No sin is so 
great, GOd is greater still, and can forgive it. No one has 
more to forgive than He. He is greater than our request, 
that is, He can do more than we ask and understand, 
Eph. 3, 20. 


And know all things. 


That is, he knows very well that we are not without 
sin; he knows our weaknesses, 


and because he knows this, he will not destroy us, but 
rather preserve us. 


V. 21. If our heart does not condemn us. 


This is idea platonica, a Platonic concept, a rule 
without example: If there are people who do not 
condemn their heart before God. Now here the question 
is: What shall | do? | find nothing good in myself. John 
answers that the hearts are of two kinds, and also the 
testimonies of the hearts. Some are convinced and feel 
that they believe in God and love their neighbor. Others, 
however, feel the opposite. Then a dispute arises: 
whether God is greater or the heart? whether sin is more 
powerful than the grace of God? To these one should 
answer: God is greater than our heart and the sin that 
dwells in us. This is the right means by which the 
despondent minds are to be lifted up in their misery. 


V. 23. And this is his commandment, that we 
believe on the name of his Son JEsu Christ, and love 
one another, as he has given us a commandment. 


This is the brief content of the whole Gospel and the 
proclamation described by John above. Certainly a 
strange speech, that it is God's commandment to 
believe. The law does not speak in this way, nor does 
reason judge, but rather rejects the gospel. For in the 
gospel the Holy Spirit punishes the world because of sin, 
that they do not believe; and this unbelief is the thing that 
belongs to the judgment of the Holy Spirit. The worldly 
authorities judge other things, have judges, magistrates, 
councilors, kings, emperors, but the worldly regime has 
nothing to do with unbelief. Therefore, to keep God's 
commandment means as much as to believe. And this 
must be done through the Holy Spirit, who must be 
poured into our hearts, renewing them, bringing about 
new good movements and a desire to carry out the 
divine will.

Description of the way and while our heart 
condemns and does not condemn us. 


69) But what this means when John says, "If our heart 
condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows 
all things," no one knows better than he who has noticed 
the words of Paul, which are read in the second chapter 
to the Romans, wv. 6-10, where he says, "God will reward 
each one according to his works, that is, praise and honor 
and incorruptibility to those who with patience in good 
works seek eternal life. But to them that are contentious, 
and do not obey the truth, but obey the unrighteous, 
disgrace and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon all souls 
that do evil." Here is a double standard, according to 
which the distribution will take place on the day of 
judgment, when the hidden things of the hearts will be 
discovered, and each one will be rewarded according to 
his works. First of all, the works of the pious are 
described, which consist in the fact that they have sought 
eternal life with patience in good works, that is, they 
persevere and are not deterred; and because they 
persevere in this, they shall also receive glory, honor and 
incorruptibility. But the wicked have four other things to 
wait for, because they neither endure nor repent, namely, 
disgrace and wrath, tribulation and anguish. The 
condemnation of these is now written in their own 
conscience, which is called Col. 2, 14, the handwriting 
that is against them; which handwriting reproaches them 
that God is rightly angry about the sins, and we cannot 
complain about His punishment. They find in it the saying 
Deut. 27:26: "Cursed be every man that keepeth not all 
the words which are written in the book of the law." And 
this is to be done without intention of the difference 
between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews thought that they 
were better than the Gentiles. But Christ has taken away 
the partition, and has made both one, One Church; that 
is, whoever now believes shall be saved; but whoever 
wants to erect a new wall by his own satisfaction for his 
sins is a blasphemer, and guilty of the blood of Christ. 
This guilt 





has the pope on himself, together with all his followers. 
In Christ, this distinction no longer applies; "neither Jew 
nor Greek, neither male nor female, neither bond nor 
free, is of any value, but only a new creature," that is, one 
who believes in Christ, Gal. 3:28. It is God alone who 
justifies the ungodly and gives grace to become 
righteous. 

When Christ speaks of the death penalty in Matthew 
5:21 ff, he distinguished it according to certain levels and 
also indicated the punishment of it according to such 
levels. He calls it: 1) "to be angry", 2) "Racha", 3) "you 
fool". As it is now with this vice, so also with all other sins. 
Cain can serve as an example of this, Genesis 4. Cain 
became angry and disguised his gesture. This is actually 
called or indignation, indignationem, the indignation that 
arises in the heart. But it consists 8uyd6¢ when man is put 
out of his composure, that he no longer knows what he 
is doing, but least of all considers that he should take 
refuge in God. This is what Cain does, he goes out of 
God's sight, he lets himself be taken in by revenge and 
assassination attempts. It is an abominable thing to run 
away from God. Cain and Abel both brought a sacrifice 
before God; but because God did not look favorably upon 
Cain's person, the sacrifice he brought did not please 
Him either. Hence arises his indignation at having been 
despised by GOD. God does not ask about Cain, but 
about Abel. At this, Cain disguises his gesture and 
becomes angry. There are vain condemnations in his 
conscience. Go on, strike dead, and you will get rid of 
them. It does not occur to him to take refuge in God. 

The conversation of God with Cain, and the inquiry: 
"Where is your brother Abel?" leads us to a new level, 


which belongs to the Opyny, or anger, and the intention 
to take revenge. There wicked people become of it, who 
beat everything into the entrenchment. If | had enough 
here! If only | had smelled myself! But it is the hatred of 
a man against GOD and against himself. Therefore, 
when Cain is asked by God, "Where is your brother 
Abel?" he answers grimly, "Shall | be my brother's 
keeper?" This means quite a 


1594 Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, nn-ini. 1595 





Hatred against GOD and his brother. A righteous and 
pious person would have said: | do not know, GOD 
knows best. 

The following words: "Cursed be you on the earth, 
which has opened its mouth and drawn the blood of your 
brother from your hands"; likewise the words: "Your 
brother's blood cries out to me from the earth" describe 
us in an angry person. But it consists in the sensation of 
that condemnation and punishment which we have 
incurred through the sin we have committed. Jesus 
spoke of this effect when he spoke to Judah, Matth. 26, 
24: "The Son of Man passes away, but woe to the man 
by whom he is betrayed; it would be better for him if he 
had never been born. The pain of those who will cry out 
on the last day after the proclamation of Christ, Luc. 23, 
30, "Mountains, fall upon us, and hills, cover us. 
Likewise Matt. 18:6: "If any of these least ones offend 
them that believe on me, it were better for him that a 
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were 
drowned in the deepest part of the sea." The wicked 
would gladly flee from GOD, and cannot, for GOD and 
all creatures are to him. Wherever he goes, he finds his 
enemies, as you can see from the above. 

73 The following words: "Behold, you drive me out of 
the land today, and | must hide myself from your face 
and be inactive and fugitive on earth, so it will happen to 
me that whoever finds me will strike me dead," belong 


to the OTEVOKWPIA, which is the shush. 
ternity and fear of death, which is nothing but the despair 


of the wicked. This word comes from OTEVvdGW, anxie 


suspiro, whose effect is howling and gnashing of teeth. 
An example of this is found in the rich gourmand and 
Lazaro, Luc. 16. The rich man lies in hell and torment, 
and wishes that Lazarus would only dip the outermost 
part of his finger in water and cool his tongue. 

74 In the same way Judah, Saul, Ahitophel and all 
those who kill themselves can be judged. When Judas 
saw that Jesus was condemned to death, he repented 
and said, "| have done evil. 


than that | have betrayed innocent blood," Matth. 27, 4. 
But this is a very bad repentance. For Judas does not 
look to God, but he wants to do enough for himself, 
since he throws away the unjust reward. This was with 
Judas 9uydc. "Opyf or ira, anger 

It is when a man hates both himself and God, and does 
not remember where to seek help. It was with Judah, 
when he went to those who had bought him to treachery, 
but received from them the consolation, "What is that to 
us? You watch." This stung his neck. At last it was with 


him OTEVOXWPIA, when he went and hanged himself, 
saying, as it were, with Cain, "My sin is greater than that 
it could be forgiven me." | find no counsel; a rope here, 
| will remedy the matter. This is the highest degree of 


OTEVOXWPIO and goes to 

ultimately so to all those who rely on their own works. 
And from such fear he burst in the middle of each other, 
which has not the opinion, as some monks dreamed, as 
if his soul had not been worthy to leave the body through 
the throat, but because he could not breathe and come 
to breath because of great pain, so he had to burst with 
fear. 

75 We can also find this in the example of Saul. It 
was with him that he, after being rejected by God, 
sought to take his revenge, and therefore had David 
sought out, sometimes by the Philistines, sometimes in 
a cave, sometimes in bed. By right, he should have 
humbled himself under the mighty hand of God; but he 
had an unrepentant heart and sinned against the Holy 
Spirit. He distinguished himself to King Saul by not 
ceasing to persecute David, not remembering God or 
His will, not caring what was pleasing or displeasing to 
God. This stemmed from the hatred against God and 
against himself. Therefore, his end would be terrible, his 
belly would burst like Judas’, and he would perish like 
the dogs. It was also with King Saul that he had the witch 
at Endor wake up the corpse of Samuel and thereby did 
something quite blasphemous, 1 Sam. 28. That is, 
forgetting God and seeking help from the devil. Such a 
person would rather

me, 1 Sam. 31. 

We will also look at the example of Ahitophel, 2 Sam. 
17. He, because he had been thrown into confusion and 
contempt by Hussai, fell into a displeasure, because he 
could not find any advice on which he could rely and 
escape the pain of the mind that he had suffered 
because of the contempt that had fallen upon him. 
Therefore, he continues to fall into he cannot and will not 
bear this contempt any longer. Therefore, he despises 
God and hates himself, his wife, his children, his 
possessions; he would rather not live than endure such 
disgrace and contempt any longer. Previously, 
Ahitophel's counsel was considered to be the counsel of 
an angel of God. David is also pushed from the royal 
throne by his own son Absalom; Ahitophel is Absalom's 
better counsel. But Ahitophel's counsels do not want to 
succeed further, because David begins to pray. The 
Lord makes his counsels vain foolishness. When he 
sees that his advice is not valid, he sits on his donkey, 
makes some right in his house, and hangs himself. So 
imprudent does contempt make him. He should have 
borne this humiliation quietly; but this is his punishment, 
that he has no courage and heart. To seek help from 
God. That is why he is tormented by his contempt and 
perishes in the process. Then he drops his courage, 
wants to flee, and yet cannot escape. Therefore he 
decides: It is better to remedy the torture, a rope here 
2c. By letting himself be so controlled by the pain he 
feels that he puts everything above it out of sight, he 
also says: "My sin is greater than that it could be 
forgiven me." And this is the grossest contempt of GOD. 
This is the case with all the saints, when things are bad 
and the need is greatest, that they say, "Oh, if | were 
dead! For in great distress, Satan is not far away, and 
he resists very much that they should find no counsel, 
comfort and help. But these thoughts: Oh, if | were dead! 
are from the murderer and death. 





The goal is to set a goal for God as to how long He will 
let us live or die. 

The opposite of these examples is found in David, 
Petro and Paulo, and in all the saints who also felt their 
sin. And this is the other part of the division made above 
[§ 69] by Paul [Rom. 2, 6. ff]. It should be noted how Paul 
divides the good works that are also to have their 
recompense with God. First he calls "patience in good 
works". This is the saying of JEsu: "But that which fell on 
a good land are they which hear it, and keep it in a fine 
and good heart, and bring forth fruit in patience." For this 
is a right good work, which grieves the old man; whereas 
this is not a good work in the sight of GOD, to wear a 
surplice, to carry a cauldron. Therefore, this is the right, 
true description of a good work, which is given here by 
Christo and Paulo. Such a good work now faces a 
fourfold retribution. 

78. 1) "Praise." The saints are sorry for their sins and 
repent of them, but they take refuge in God. The 
despised David endures in his distress and does not lay 
his hand on the anointed of the Lord, 1 Sam. 24, 7. Also 
when he said, "Let him curse, the Lord has told him," 2 
Sam. 16, 11. Likewise, "If it pleases the Lord, he will 
bring me back; but if not, let the will of the Lord be done," 
2 Sam. 15, 25. 26. 

79. 2) "Honor." The saints hate their sin, but not God 
or themselves. They do not cry out, "Oh, what have | 
done?" but only seek to be free from sin, and do not drop 
their courage in doing so. Thus David prays in the 6th 
Psalm. 

80. 3) "Peace and incorruptibility." For those who rest 
in the words of God say: The Lord has had mercy on me, 
and has distinguished the law of the flesh from the law 
of the spirit. They let the ass go and do according to its 
kind. 1) Thus David prays: Have mercy on me, my God, 
and | will praise you that you are so gracious and 
merciful. 


1) That is, they leave the old person behind. 


1598 


81. 4) "Eternal life." This is what the believers always 
oppose to the weakness of their flesh. For God is greater 
than their heart. There is no sin so great, God can and 
will forgive it. 

Jacob is in fear and wants to flee from the face of his 
brother Esau, so that he will not be killed by him. 
Therefore, he first flees to God, and this refuge honors 
him in such a way that he thinks to himself: "All this is 
happening to me from God, so now | will also expect the 
help of the Lord, for he is my help in trouble. In this way 
he calls upon God, as we read in Genesis Cap. 32, 
where he says: "The God of my father Abraham has 
saved me." And that is 2) [v. 11..] "from the hand of my 
brother," which is his [God's] glory. 3) From this follows 
peace. Jacob does not drop his courage, although he 
knew that his brother, who would meet him, had sworn 
[to him] death. But he relies on the word, and says [v. 
10.], "I am too little of all mercy and faithfulness. For 
thou, O LORD, hast said unto me, | will bring thee home 
again unto thy land." From this Jacob receives the right 
life, and says: God is greater than my heart, greater than 
my brother, greater than my fear. And even though he 
has to fight a battle with God, he calls this place "Pniel". 
And adds [Gen. 32, 33.], "| have seen the LORD face to 
face, and my soul is recovered." Moses adds that the 
sun rose at that time, and thus mixes the spiritual 
meaning with the literal narration. 

Peter denied Christ and was almost lost. He falls from 
grace, but he does not lose all thought. For as soon as 
the cock crows after his last denial, he goes out of the 
palace of the high priest and weeps bitterly. But it does 
not remain with the mere weeping and going out, but he 
also remembers the word of Christ, who had said to him: 
"Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times", 
Matth. 26, 34. Peter's case is therefore a serious case, 
and he is a great offender. But because he sticks to the 
word, he does not fall into eternal disgrace, but does true 
repentance. Judas had also left, but Peter was of the 
same mind.

quite different in nature from Judas. Next, he has a 
hatred, but not against God, but only against his 
committed sin, and this brings him honor. Therefore he 
was asked by Christ, Joh. 21, 15: "Simon Peter, do you 
love me more than these? And he answered, "Lord, you 
know." As if he wanted to say, "| do remember my sin, in 
which | have not given the slightest proof of my love for 
you, but nevertheless | have trusted in your goodness, 
and have risen up with the word that you said to me, 
"Satan has desired to sift you as wheat, but | have 
prayed for you that your faith may not cease," Luc. 
22:31. Peace follows this. For Peter now gives thanks 
that he has learned how we can now overcome in 
tribulations. Now he understands the word of JEsu 
Matth. 18, 22.: "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy 
times seven." Finally he remembered that GOD was 
greater than his heart, and so he had the right life. This 
is the summa of the Gospel, that | may take hold of the 
rod in tribulation, and know assuredly that God is greater 
than my heart. 

84 Here also belongs the beautiful passage from 
Rom. 8, 32: "God did not spare His own Son, but gave 
Him up for us all. How should he not with him give us all 
things?" Hereupon the apostle explains what is that 
which he has given us with him, v. 33.: "Who will," he 
says, "accuse the elect of GOD?" V. 35: "Who will 
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ 
Jesus our Lord?" This means that God is greater than 
our heart. How does one prove this? Answer: 1) He has 
given His Son for us, that is, we will not be lacking, our 
own heart will condemn us, the master of the rod, the 
beadle, the judge, Satan; but God is here, who makes 
righteous, who is a merciful judge, although these 
peelers are standing there. And even if our heart speaks 
a loud no, God still passes judgment for us, we have a 
good thing, because God defends us from the villains, 
and says: Troll you, you villains. So they flee, and with 
them death, hell and Satan. 2) "Who will separate us 
from the love of God?" The temptations may be as great 
as they want, but none of them will be able to harm us. 


1600 Interpretation on 1 John 4, 1. W. ix. iigo-NW. 1601 


The fourth chapter. 


Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits 
whether they are of God: for many false prophets are 
gone out into the world. 

(1) The reason for the good counsel given in this 
chapter is to be repeated from the conclusion of the 
preceding third chapter. For there he had said, "By this 
we know that we abide in him, by the Spirit which he hath 
given us." From this arises inevitably the question: Who 
is the same Spirit? And so this chapter contains the 
explanation of this. One must give the child a name in 
order to know what the same spirit is called by which we 
recognize that God abides in us. For there are more 
spirits in the world. This text is therefore connected with 
the previous one in such a way that no syllable of it can 
be omitted. 

2. 1) First of all, we find that there are two kingdoms 
of spirits, which are of great power and strength, namely, 
the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan. Satan is 
as strong in his children as God is in his. And by nature 
the holy men are also in this kingdom. They have sucked 
it from their mothers and are stuck in it. If Satan is not to 
have any power over us, and if we are to get rid of him, 
we must have this text. 

3. 2) We must also note the instruments that are used 
in these realms. But in the kingdom of God it is the word 
of God. For it is said of it, v. 2: "Every spirit that confesses 
that Jesus Christ has come into the flesh is of God. God 
lets his word go, thereby he administers his kingdom. But 
Satan also has his word, by which he spreads his 
kingdom, and he also has his power and strength, 
according to the description of Christ, who calls Satan a 
strong armed man, who keeps his palace, so that what 
is his may be left to him in peace, Luc. 11, 21. Similarly, 
it is said, 2 Cor. 4, 4, that the gospel is also revealed for 
the sake of those to whom the God of these things is not 
of God. 


The world has blinded their eyes so that they do not see 
the bright light of it. 

4. 3) Now if there is a word of teaching in this realm, 
there is also a confession in it. For not all who will one 
day say to Christ: Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of 
God, Matth. 7, 21. What kind of confession must it be? 
Whoever teaches the doctrine must be confessed. The 
test of it is this: "Every spirit that confesses that Jesus 
Christ has come into the world is of God." The test is fine 
gold. Accordingly, the confession is this: that not Satan, 
but only the Father is our Lord. This difference of 
confession also makes a difference among the kingdom. 
It is not enough that the Jews, Saracens and Turks 
confess that God created heaven and earth and that for 
this reason He is our Lord, but it must also be added that 
He is the God whose Son, Jesus Christ, was conceived 
in Nazareth, born in Bethlehem, who hungered and 
thirsted as another man, who preached the will of God, 
who dealt with other men, who was poor and miserable, 
who helped to raise Joseph, who finally suffered and 
died under Pontio Pilato. This is the Jesus who makes 
us blessed. From this follows the conclusion that he is 
the true God who has a Son through whom the world 
shall be saved. An explanation of this saying can be read 
from two passages in my writings. First, in the sermon 
that bears the title: "Army Sermon Against the Turks," 1) 
where, in the explanation of the other commandment, it 
is remembered that the Christian slaves imprisoned in 
Turkey thought of this article: And of JEsum Christum, 
his only-begotten Son, our Lord; whereby, avoiding all 
hypocrisy, they press their hands with their thumbs and 
say: JEsus Christ is my splendor and my holiness. 2) 
The other place is found in the postilion of the day.

Interpretations on the | Epistle SI. Johannis. W. ix, 1132-1134. 


1603 





John the Baptist, 1) who did not trust in his own holiness, 
but pointed people to Christ, who alone is the way, the 
truth and the life, and apart from whom no other name is 
given to men, in which they should be saved. John the 
Baptist led a very strict way of life, but what did it help 
him without Christ? Therefore it is better to drink 
malmsey and walk on roses in faith in Christ than to put 
on a hard shirt or eat locusts without Christ, because all 
this does no good without Christ, and the latter does no 
harm with Christ. 


The first is from the Old Testament, the 
second is from the New Testament. 


5 We find various descriptions of the testing of spirits 
in the holy scriptures. But first of all the place 5 Mos. 18, 
18. 19. is very strange, because it actually concerns the 
great prophet, whom the holy scripture called Messiah. 
The same place means: "I will raise up a prophet from 
among their brethren, and will put my words in his 
mouth; and he shall speak unto them all things 
whatsoever | shall command." But this place does not 
merely contain a teaching, but a warning is also added: 
"Whosoever will not hear my words which he shall speak 
in my name, of him will | require it." One has probably 
never seen anything more perfect and skilful than the 
Law of Moses, for it contains everything that is intended 
both for God and for man. For example, it is a 
reasonable law that if someone finds a bird's nest in 
which the mother is sitting on the eggs or young, they 
should let them fly away, Deut. 22:6, 7. Likewise, when 
it decrees how it should be kept clean in the camp of the 
Israelites, and everyone should sweep out the filth, Deut. 
23:12, ff. Now if the law has commanded all such works, 
so that nothing new can be devised apart from its 
precepts, it follows that this prophet of whom Moses 
speaks here has a quite different, heavenly teaching. 


1) Walch, St. Louis Edition, .vol. XI, 2268 ff. 





[has] to recite. For this confoundeth reason together, and 
thinketh that nothing better can be said. And God also 
wanted to disgrace them in such a way that he said: If 
the work of the law does not help, how much less your 
own works. The police laws thus had their intentions on 
the Jewish people and on their courts. But this prophet 
did not come to choose a special people from among the 
people, to prescribe laws and an outward police for them, 
but this was his work, that he should give power to 
become children of God to those who believe in his 
name. From this should now arise a completely different 
way of serving GOtt, namely this: To fear GOD, to 
believe, to call upon His name, to hear Him, and to follow 
Him. Now many are opposed to this true prophet, that 
they do not hear him. And this is the characteristic of all 
false prophets. Such false prophets have different 
names in the Old Testament. They are called: 


6. 1) XXXXX, Kosemim, vaticinatores; and these 
are the dreamers who bring their dreams into the 
Scriptures. Of this kind are among us the abbot 
Joachim's interpretations of the prophet Jeremiah, which 
Munzer 2) has followed. Such people have gained much 
experience and have often been tempted to death. 
Therefore, Satan has taught them the arrogant thought 
of themselves, as if they were masters of the Scriptures; 
they want to explain and interpret everything according 
to their imagination; and especially Muenzer 2) has 
boasted that if there were no Bible, he would make anew 
one. Such cosemem are now the Brigitta, Sybilla and 
others. Among them is also Storchius, who said that he 
was sent to wield the sword, and that he received this 
calling from the angel Gabriel. These and similar people 
have miserably deceived both themselves and the poor 
peasants. 

7. 2) To the other class belong XXXXX, Onenim, 3) 
that is, the diurnal voters; the like 


2) "Minzer" put by us instead of: "Mincerus" in the old edition. 
Compare under § 15, where Storch and Munzer are also placed next 
to each other. 

3) "Onenim" put by us instead of "Meronenim" according to Jer. 27, 
9. 


1604

1605 





There are also people among us who say, for example, 
that it is good to wean children on such and such a day. 
Item: Satan has more to do with one woman in six weeks 
than with another. 

8. 3) The XXXXXX Menaheschim, that are the 
soothsayers, such among us: If the raven or the owl 
cries, then one will die. This has now become a great 
truth among the common man, what such people once 
taught them. 


9. 4) XXXXXX Mechasbim, malefici, warlocks. Some 
think that such a thing cannot happen. But it is very easy 
for Satan, by divine permission, to make a projectile in 
the arm or thigh, in which hair, coals, iron and the like 
are found. Among us belongs here: the wheel of fortune, 
the traveling students, the weather makers, putting a 
dash through the grain; he [Satan] cannot even kill it. In 
the second book of Moses it was commanded that such 


a malefica should not be left alive. 


10. 5) XXXXXX Hoberim, incantatores, dragon 
brides, and dragon bridegroom, they fetch cheese, 
butter, grain; but it does not pay well. From reason one 
cannot judge enough how far the power of Satan 
extends. These dragon brides sting brown and blue, as 
if one were beaten. Item, the Wischelein, which the 
people, so serviced, 1) wait for the horses, wash up, and 
the like. In Ireland there are such servile spirits, likewise 
in Torgau. In the Mark, Satan served in a monastery and 
carried everything necessary until he got a canon 
stabbed to death; he then went around the monastery, 
sounding as if with bells, and shouted that he had served 
them until he was removed from the way. Therefore we 
are not to be sure, because this evil spirit is everywhere 
near, soon in the brain, soon in the heart of man. Here 
also belong the treasure diggers, the crystal seers. Read 


also the Augustinum de civitate Dei. Here belong the 
incubi, who must be given roast meat to eat and wine to 
drink on Thursdays. Satan demands the external 


1) i.e. to keep servants. 





The service of men as a sign of his dominion over them, 
so that one day they may despair at the hour of their 
death and have to say as a sign of their own 
condemnation: O woe! | have given him food and drink 
in addition. 


11. 6) XXXXX Oboth, python, or pythonissa the wise 
man, wise woman, people who can tell fortunes and 
indicate when something is lost. Examples of this can be 
found in the lives of the ancient fathers. When Julianus 
Apostata had banished the devil, Macarius prayed and 
thus prevented Satan from passing by, which he also 
confessed to Juliano when he inquired of him. Item, that 
one stabs into a water, and thus gouges out an eye. In 
Silesia there was a house in which there was such a 
monster at night that no one could stay in it. It was 
announced to a lansquenet, who lay in the house for a 
night. When he heard such a clamor of cats and other 
animals that he was terrified and jumped up and pulled 
off his leathers, lashing out. In the morning they found 
the women, who were suspected of some devilry: one 
had no arm, the other no eye, and the third was sore. 


See acta de Pythone. 


12. 7) XXXXX Jidonim, sortilegi and our astrologers 
or astrologers, who erect planetary houses, and 
according to them want to prophesy or put nativity: 
Whoever is born in such and such a sign will be a 
drunkard, a fornicator, or a pious, happy person. But we 
are all born in the sign of Adam and Eve; we come into 
the world as sinners, as angry, as blasphemers, and 
inclined to all evil. This is our horoscopium. 

13. 8) and 9). Finally, there are those who ask the 
dead or make their children pass through the fire. The 
nine kinds of false prophecies are told by Moses, and 
therefore one must know them, so that we learn to fear 
God from the heart. Cicero, in his fine book de 


divinatione, has laughed at this, and has mentioned 
several more types of it, but says that it is teasing, 2) that 
such things do not happen by intention, but by chance. 
This is how far reason has fallen, 


2) i.e. empty talk.

that she wants to despise all this as vanity and deception 
The best advice is that we keep to our true prophet Jesus 
Christ and his teachings. Isa. 8:20: "According to the law 
and the testimony" we should keep; if this does not 
happen, we will not see the dawn. 

(14) In the New Testament we find three or four verseg 
that give us a rule on how to test the spirits that now and 
then stand out among God's people and want to be seen 
as people who have new prophecies and want to instruct 
Christians in them. The first place is Rom. 12:7, where it 
says, "If anyone has prophecy, let it be like faith." The 
second place is 1 Cor. 14:31, 32: "Ye can all prophesy 
that they all may learn. And the spirits of the prophets are 
subject to the prophets." Which also applies to those wha 
say, "The spirit drives me. The right spirit is a disciplined 
spirit that does nothing willfully and carelessly. The third 
place is here in 1 John 4:3: "Every spirit that teaches and 
confesses that Jesus is the Lord," that teaches that we 
are saved by the grace of Jesus Christ, without our own 
works, "is of God." The fourth place is 2 Pet. 1, 16. 17. 
"We have not followed wise fables, when we made known 
to you the power and future of JEsu Christ; but we have 
seen His glory for ourselves, when He received glory and 
honor from God the Father, by a voice which came to Him 
from the great glory, saying: This is my beloved Son, in 
whom | am well pleased." Then he adds, wv. 19, 20: "We 
have a firm prophetic word, and you do well to heed it, ag 
a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and 
the morning star rises in your hearts. And this ye ought ta 
know, that no prophecy of the scripture is of your own 
interpretation." From these four oters of holy scripture, 4 
description of what a prophecy actually is can be made 
as follows: A prophecy is a teaching directly revealed by 
God, which is powerful to teach and comfort all men, and 
which confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh for 
the salvation of men. 





(15) The Turks boast that they have prophecy, as do 
the Papists and the Jews, and we also boast that we 
receive it from God when we preach the Gospel and 
administer the sacraments. Furthermore, Storchius and 
Munzer, the sacrament abusers, boast of such 
prophecies; furthermore, those who deny the baptism of 
small children. Now examine all these prophecies 
according to the description of a prophecy given above, 
and consider: 

1. whether it has the characteristics of a divine 

inspiration? 

2. whether it is similar to faith; or whether it has an 

explicit command, word and promise of God for 
itself? 
Whether it also teaches with earnestness and 
emphasis to fear God, to trust in His grace and 
mercy, or whether it instructs people to repent 
and seek forgiveness of their sins from God. 

4. Whether it can also provide comfort in times of 

trial? 

5. whether they also confess that Jesus Christ, the 

Son of God, has come in the flesh? 

16. Because the Turks despise the command of God: 
Because the Turks despise the command of God, "This 
is the one you shall hear," and do not consider Christ 
worthy to be accepted as their mediator (for God's 
people must also act according to the command given 
by God); because, on the other hand, the papists seek 
justification in their own works, with contempt for the true 
faith in Jesus; because, furthermore, the Jews, just as 
the Turks, deny and blaspheme Christ; because our new 
prophets likewise do not press for Christ; and finally, the 
new seducers and sacramental abusers, following their 
own speculations, and taking the dreams of their reason 
for divine revelations, say that now and then in the holy 


Scriptures it means so much as significat, therefore it 
must everywhere be taken and declared to be 
significat: it follows that they have no such prophecy of 


which they can boast that it was revealed to them by 
God. The dialecticians call such kinds of conclusions 


fallacias consequentis, when one concludes thus: In 
such and such a place the

17 We have the firm prophetic word against Papists, 
Turks, Jews and Gentiles: "Christ died for our sins and 
was raised for our righteousness", Rom. 4, 25. "We are 
justified without merit through Jesus Christ, whom God 
has set before us as a mercy seat through faith in His 
blood," Rom. 3:24, 25. His blood cleanses our 
conscience from dead works," Heb. 9:14. We believe this 
revelation and prophecy because it is a firm word. The

Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And 
this is the spirit of antichrist, of which ye have heard 
that it shall come, and is already now in the world. 


18 Hereby John makes a contrast between a spirit 
that is of God and the one that is not of God: 


1. aspirit that is not of God denies that Jesus Christ came 
into the flesh. 

2. the spirit that is not of God dwells and works in the 
unbelievers. 

The spirit of the world speaks what is pleasing to the 
world, and the world also hears him. 

The spirit that is not of God is a spirit of falsehood and 
error. 

(5) Those who follow the spirit of the world have no love 
for one another, but seek only their own, as the rich 
glutton did. 

(6) Those who follow the spirit of the world have the 
characteristic that they are not of God. 


(7) Those who have the spirit of the world do not do as 
God does. 


Not to make Christ into Moses, and the gospel into the 
law. The faith that is active through love makes blessed. 
It does not speak of love as it is active toward one's 
neighbor, but by virtue of which we cling to God and are 
certain that He will not forsake us. (See the explanation 
of the epistle to the Galatians.) 


1610' Interpretations of the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1192-1195. 1611 





Every spirit that confesses that JEsus has come 
into the flesh. 

There is a twofold great emphasis in the word "Christ" 
and in the word "confess". 1) First of all, there is much 
force and emphasis in the few words: "Jesus Christ has 
come into the flesh". For he who teaches that Jesus 
Christ has come into the world confesses that all good 
and all perfect gifts have come down from above to men. 
He confesses that the Word became flesh, or that God 
sent His Son into our flesh to bear and endure our 
weakness in the flesh. He also teaches that the Christ, 
who has been in the bosom of the Father from eternity 
and was promised to the faithful in the Old Testament 
through the prophets, has made his dwelling among us 
and lived, that is, has hungered and thirsted, has worked, 
and has grown weary like other men; that he has 
performed the office entrusted to him, has lived as al 
common man, and has suffered all the things that befall 
a man in this world; that he further endured true agony 
and the terrors of hell, died on the cross, rose from the 
dead on the third day, and then ascended into heaven; 
that he thereby truly redeemed us, reconciled the Father, 
sent the Holy Spirit, and established a church on earth in 
which all true believers have a common share in the fine 
goods they have acquired; that he may be with us at last, 
and comfort us in all our afflictions, that we of ourselves 
are not able and able; that we are not saved by our own 
works, but by the grace of God and the love of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. Therefore, the word "Christ" contains two 
important terms, namely fine anointing for the work of 
redemption, and redemption itself. The anointing 
convicts us of the gracious will of God towards us; but 
the redemption gives us forgiveness of sins, life and 
blessedness. Christ was destined from eternity to 
redeem the world. The Father's counsel becomes flesh. 
This is an unspeakable mystery, it is wonderful in our 


eyes. These are two extrema in materia remotissima, 
that is, in two infinite 





things far different from each other. The eternal God 
becomes a man, lives and weaves like other men. He 
came in the midst of us, lived like us, turned water into 
wine, was ready to serve, and yet was in danger of being 
stoned. 

21. 2) Now this Christ is to be confessed. -For he who 
confesses him confesses first of all the reason why he 
came into the world, namely, that we cannot be saved 
by our own works or by our own strength, but must be 
reconciled to God and accepted in grace only through 
his bloody death and his great merit. Whoever confesses 
this repents, praises God, loves his neighbor, 
recognizes the greatness of divine grace and mercy, 
which is higher than all reason; he fears lest he offend 
God again, with whom he was once reconciled through 
Christ; he calls upon God and knows that he is loved by 
Him as achild by its father. But he who denies that Jesus 
Christ came into the flesh also denies the cause of his 
mission into the world, relies on his own works, deprives 
Christ of the name of a mediator, does not fear God, 
does not thank him for his grace, does not guard against 
insults to him, does not recognize Christ as one who 
came into the world to make us children of God, but only 
as a people who are to be kept in discipline and order by 
all kinds of laws. These people do not drive a goose 
across the path of our Lord God, saying: If | did not have 
it better than others, | would rather have become a 
monk. 

22 A question arises: whether the works that precede 
faith or the works that follow it make a man righteous? 
The Gospel answers: Neither the works that precede nor 
those that follow make a man righteous, but only faith in 
Jesus Christ. But the good works that God has 
commanded serve to give us an exercise of our faith. It 
is therefore far safer to attribute everything to the grace 
of God. The Scholastici 1) sing: Kyrie eleison, but they 
add: This is a 


1) d, i. the school theologians. 


1612 


hard word for the flesh; make also well these wrong 
conclusions: If works do not make righteous, then man 
would have no free will at all; or: If works do not make 
righteous, there will be a desolate, raw life. But God 
says, "Be it hard or severe, | will have it so. This is the 
sign of Jonah. But they do it in such a way that the truth 
must give way to lies; they impose their laws, orders, 
monasteries, and deny Christ over it. 

So far, the two words "Christ" and "confess" have 
been used. Now the expression is still left: "He who is of 
GOD", or "born of GOD", [who] shall be called a child of 
GOD. | will give a common example: If | were traveling 
in a foreign land and were a stranger there, but said to 
one whose son or brother | knew, "I should greet you 
from your son, brother," he would say to me, "Do you 
know my son? Come into my house, spend the night 
with me. In this way, the name of the son | know would 
make [me] comfortable with the father | did not know 
before. So also no one knows God, for no one has ever 
seen Him; but if we invoke the name of the Son, and say, 
Oh Father, | am indeed a great sinner, but | know your 
Son, Jesus Christ, [we become pleasing to God]. 1) 
These then are they of whom John says, "The Son has 
given them power to become children of God," John 
1:12. But who are such? "Those who believe in His 
name." So also here John says, "You are of GOD, and 
GOD is greater than your heart." Here again belongs the 
story of Cain and Ahitophel. 


V. 4. Little children, you are of God and have 
overcome those, for he who is in you is greater than 
he who is in the world. 

Note here that there is an emphasis in the words: 
"who is in you". The note is very beautiful that Augustine 
made of a twofold governor and ruler, namely Christ and 
Satan. The former goes to life, but the latter to 
damnation. Just 


1) Added by us. 


Interpretation on 1 John 4:3-7. 





W. ix, iiss-nos. 1613 


This is also expressed in Rom. 8, 14. 9. thus: 
"Whosoever is moved by the Spirit of God, they are the 
children of God; but whosoever hath not the Spirit of 
Christ, the same is not his." 


V.5 They are of the world, therefore they speak of 
the world, and the world hears them. 


25 That is, they act on worldly things that are 
nowhere commanded to them by God. The whole saying 
can be easily understood by virtue of the contrast and 
compared to what is read in Gal. 1, 10: "Am | now 
preaching to men or to God? 


V. 6. We are of God, and he who knows God hears 
us. He who is not of God does not hear us. 


This saying again belongs to the testing and 
discernment of spirits. Paul especially emphasizes this 
in Romans 10:17: "Faith comes from the sermon" or the 
hearing of the divine word. In contrast to this are the 
Anabaptists and Sacramentarians, who despise the 
outward word of God; but their judgment stands: They 
are not of God. Others say: Yes, no one is improving; 
and we all often cry: It will not go away. On the other 
hand, they are told to continue listening until God's grace 
is manifested more in them, and they can overcome the 
world and sin. 


By this we recognize the spirit of truth and the 
spirit of error. 


It is the spirit of error that deceives us, does not hear 
us, or at least only pretends to hear us. The spirit of truth, 
however, deals with truth, he hears and believes, and in 
believing calls upon God more and more. It is a twofold 
righteousness. The one has ears and hands; the other 
has ears and a heart. The former says: | hear enough, if 
| could only do it; the latter says: | hear it, if | could only 
believe. 


V. 7. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of 
God, and he who loves is born of God and knows 
God. 


Here now follow the praises of right love. The 
description is: "Who loves 


1614 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. IX, 1198-1200. 


1615 





is from God. This love changes the heart, so that man 
makes a comparison between the spiritual benefits that 
God has shown us and the physical ones that we owe to 
our neighbor. This is a true new birth. 


V. 8. He who does not love does not know God, for 
God is love. 


Not only does he not know God, but there is darkness 
and ignorance in his heart. 


V. 9. In this the love of God toward us appeared, 
that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, 
that we might live through Him. 


(30) Thus John shows the right origin of blessedness; 
otherwise man always remains with a trust in his works. 
The law and our own gratifications kill us. 


V. 10. In this is love, not that we loved God, but 
that He loved us and sent His Son to be the 
propitiation for our sin. 


The love of God and the love of neighbor are the most 
important things in the Gospel. In explaining the two 
great commandments, Christ adds: "The other is like it: 
You shall love your neighbor as yourself." That is, you 
cannot love me if you love yourself more, but give thanks 
to God that he first loved you, and if you lack, call on him. 
The Law, and the love commanded in it, cannot lead us 
to God, it is too high; but the Gospel leads us to God, and 
something becomes of it. 


Note from the right kind of love. 


32) This is not true love, if one only gives much to his 
neighbor, for this latter can also be done by the pagans. 
But true love is actually a movement of the Holy Spirit in 
the heart to do good to one's neighbor. Therefore Paul 
wrote: "If | take all my possessions and give them to the 
poor, and do not have love, | would be nothing", 1 Cor. 
13:3. Giving is therefore a fruit of love, but it is not a fruit 
of love. 





not love itself. This saying of Paul is therefore a correct 
rule according to which love must be judged. Love is a 
spiritual gift that touches the heart and not only the hand, 
that cleanses the heart, but by no means sweeps out the 
purse and exhausts the necessary means for the 
maintenance of life. It is a fervent will and benevolence. 
Accordingly, a spiritual kind of love is required from 
Johanne, in which | do not exist before the world, but 
before God. In the love of the world there is no desire to 
do good, but the love of Christians feels such a desire. 
Love is not what the hand does, but what the heart feels. 
The law of Moses cannot do that. 


v. 12. No one has ever seen God. If we love one 
another, God remains in us, and His love is 
completely in us. 


This is a new subject, which deals with the difference 
between the law and the gospel. The law insists on love, 
the gospel demands faith, by which alone we know how 
much we are loved by God. The world does not grasp 
this teaching and cannot find its way into it. The Gospel 
says: Recognize the good that God has shown you, and 
be careful not to offend Him in the future with your sins. 
That is, the Gospel points to the forgiveness of sins in 
addition to repentance. Just as works and trust in them, 
as two distinct things, must be distinguished from one 
another. 


No one has ever seen God. 
Therefore, no man has ever been able to begin to love 


God. Nil amatum, nisi cognitum, what one does not 
know, one cannot love. Therefore, those who want to 
please or reconcile with God either through the law, or 
through their own gratifications, or through the love they 
think they have for God, deceive both themselves and 
others. All that we see of God is His love and the benefits 
flowing from it. He who believes in God's love for him 
also sees God in such faith. 


1616 


We also see God in His great works, because of which 
He is called the God of Jerusalem, the God of Zion, the 
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the God who led 
His people out of Egypt with a strong hand. John wrote 
in his Gospel Cap. 1, 18: "No one has ever seen God, 
but the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the 
Father, has revealed Him to us." 


In this, His love is completely with us. 

That is, his love expresses itself in us in all kinds of 
good effects, and makes it possible for us to love one 
another warmly again. Therein lies at the same time a 
glorious consolation of the Holy Spirit for a frightened, 
stupid conscience. The latter preaches the comforting 
truths, but the latter tastes such comfort in itself and is 
calmed by it. 


If we love each other among ourselves. 


Thirty-six: Do you ask: How do | come to love those 
who are also my enemies? Answer: This is the result of 
God's love, which makes me do to others what God has 
done to me. That is, to go in and out with God. 


V. 13. By this we know that we abide in him, and 
he in us, that he hath given us of his Spirit. 

This spirit works in us all kinds of good movements 
of the heart, which is a sign that such love cannot be 
considered a mere fruit of human nature. Some say, to 
be sure: Who will get better from it? And this is also the 
complaint of many saints, which they present to God in 
their weakness: "It will not get better, because you hit it 
in the back with a club. 


V. 14, And we have seen and bear witness that the 
Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 

John cannot cope with the ideas of love. Paul says: 
This is the word we preach to you. John makes the 
gospel the basis of such love. 


Interpretation on 1 John 4:12-16. 





W. ix, 1200-1203. 1617 
The Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the 
world. 


(39) This is the true sign by which we know that we 
are loved by the Father. And it is none other than the 
sign of the prophet Jonah. 


V. 15. Whoever therefore confesses that Jesus is 
the Son of God, in him abides God, and he in God. 


(40) This is a fruit of the foregoing, that all things must 
be brought into confession, and the mouth opened. 


V. 16. God is love, and he who abides in love abides 
in God, and God in him. 


In the Benedicite, everything is pure, clean and 
evangelical. In it we ask three things of God: 1) Bless us, 
God, and feed us in our souls. 2) Preserve also my body 
and those gifts by which it may be nourished and 
preserved; and this do not for my works, but for thy 
mercy's sake. 3) Especially through Jesus Christ, your 
Son, whom you sent to be my Savior. "God is love, and 
we are all children at His table. Therefore resist the devil, 
lest he stir up strife and dissension among us. Therefore, 
when you sit down at table with others, do not forget to 
pray: "God is love. O Lord! Keep us safe, Satan will 
cause strife, watch that strife is not instigated by him. 
Seldom does a table full of guests sit together that 
something hostile should not go on among them. Some 
may be offended only with a little word, then he becomes 
restless about it, and this happens if they have not 
prayed. That is why there is so much quarreling, 
misunderstanding, and even murder and death in the 
course of hostilities. This is where the 133rd Psalm of 
David belongs: "Behold, how good and how sweet it is 
when brothers are united. In hostilities, people of various 
kinds come together, poor and rich, pious and wicked, 
one living in these circumstances, the other in those. 
Give us, then, O Lord, the grace to learn to bear with all 
people's customs. For God is love. 


1618 


Interpretations of the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1203-1205.

God is love. 


He wants all people to be helped and, as proof of his| 
love, he also distributes his benefits among them without 
distinction. 


And he who abides in love abides in GOD, and 
GOD in him. 


Thus, true Christians do it according to the example of 
God: they work for the betterment of all people and 
distribute their good deeds among them. Behold, how 
pleasant and sweet it is! God loves peace. This balm 
must now flow down into Aaron's beard and onto his 
garment, and the great and noble must learn to bear the 
small and lesser. Augustini’s golden saying should be 
inscribed everywhere. Unhappy is the man who sleeps in 
this life, in which he does not like to die. One should see} 
how he stands with God and his neighbor. So also, when 
you go to the table with others, make the cross for 
yourself and others, and say, "God is love," keep me from 
being angered by another's word or work. Love is actually| 
a sweet, pleasant sensation of the heart, and a kindly, 
inclination toward our neighbor, which is sometimes also 
connected with all kinds of real good deeds. Augustine} 


explained these words effectively, or with regard to thein 
effect: "God is love," that is, He first demonstrates love in| 
His Son; for "for this reason God shows His love for us, 
that while we were still His enemies, Christ died for us," 
Rom. 5:8. But He also demonstrates love with regard to} 
the outward temporal life of man. He is love in the flesh, 
An example can be taken from the cow and the calf. Al 
cow wants to be suckled by the calf; and when the calf 
attacks her udders with great desire, she does not strike, 
but endures; yes, she entices the calf with her cry that it 
should take its food from her. In this way, God is also} 


effective in love. He wants to be throbbed, shaken and 
awakened, just as Jesus was when he slept in the ship, 
when we are in need of nourishment of body and life. And 
if we forget to knock at his door, he will wake us up| 
himself. 





that we should ask, seek, knock. 

(44) In this place, love is first presented as complete 
love; then the various kinds of love are described; and 
finally it is shown how such love is also found in us. The 
description of love as a complete love is contained in the 
words: 


V. 17. In this love is fully with us, that we may 
have joy in the day of judgment. 


Here, then, love is presented as complete love, with 
regard to its effect. For love consists in having a good 
heart toward God, in trusting Him that He not only really 
loves us now, but also that He will never leave us, yes, 
that God, as it was said above, is greater than our heart. 
But then love is not complete if man does not know that 
God is greater than his heart. Consider this, whoever will, 
and he will find that this love is very seldom found in the 
hearts of men; it contains a very high doctrine, in which 
few bring it to perfection. This place has been treated 
quite extensively by Paulo Rom. 8. There he investigates 
the reason why a Christian should bear the cross 
patiently. There are many reasons to be found, but the 
last one is taken from the nature of human courts, in 
which a judge, plaintiff and defendant are to be found. 
The plaintiffs are our own heart and conscience, as it was 
said above: "If our heart condemns us. Then man stands 
in the court of God, and has his own heart as plaintiff and 
witness against him. There David asks in the 42nd 
Psalm, v. 6: "Why do you grieve, my soul, and are so 
troubled within me?" Fie on you, soul! After all, GOD is 
merciful. God is here, who makes just, approves our 
cause, but the plaintiffs receive a negative answer. 
Therefore, it now remains true: "GOD is greater than our 
heart." And the Gospel is a mirror in which we can see 
the kindness and lightness of GOD. "Who will condemn? 
Christ is here, who represents us," who is our intercessor 
with the Father, whom the Father is also pleased to hear. 
The admonition of Jesus Luc. 6, 36. also belongs here: 
"Be merciful, as 


1620 


- Interpretation on 1 John 4, 


17. 18. W. ix, 120.-,-”. 1621 





Your Father also is merciful"; "who makes his rain to fall, 
and his sun to shine upon the evil and upon the good, 
upon the just and upon the unjust", Matth. 5, 45. Sun and 
rain are the greatest of the bodily benefits. The sun gives 
life, the rain the sustenance of it. God pours out these 
great benefits on all people. And just in this God's love is 
completely against us, because no respect of the person 
takes place. All people should be like this, but since they 
are not really all like this, they should repent for this 
reason. 


For as he is, so are we in this world. 


46. Just as God is impartial in His love, giving rain and 
sunshine to all without distinction, so shall we be; and if 
it be so, God is also our Father in heaven. Paul's 
explanation of the seventh commandment, to which he 
counts work, "so that one may give to the needy", Eph. 
4, 28, is to be counted here. Not working is already theft; 
not less, if one deprives others, especially the needy, of 
help. Summa, as we enjoy God, so shall our people 
enjoy us again. 


V. 18. Fear is not in love, but complete love casts 
out fear. 


The nature of love is twofold. The first is a complete 
love that does not fear because it is convinced and 
certain of God's goodness. The other is an imperfect love 
that is always afraid. Imagine the two adverse affections, 
hatred and love. At times the heart softens, can forgive, 
but it does not last long in it, and soon becomes hostile 
again. Now, if a man loves soon, hates soon, this 
indicates a great weakness; these adverse affects 
alternate in him in one hour. God allows this to happen, 
however, so that He may put a bridle and a bit on us, and 
we should not boast of our own virtues and merits. 
Imagine bravery and timidity. In the case of the latter, 
man is sometimes willing and ready to die; soon, 
however, other thoughts set in with him. He remembers 
that others do not 





He therefore wishes: "Oh, let death not yet come! In the 
3rd Psalm, v. 7, David says: "| am not afraid of many 
hundreds of thousands that are set against me. Where 
the world would be against me, | would not take hold of 
the earth. But soon after he says, v. 8, "Arise, O Lord, 
and help me." For with you one finds the right help. 
Hilarius and Augustine also testify to this, that when they 
felt a little spark in their souls, they soon sank back into 
hell. There Christ says of Judah: "Satan must stand at 
his right hand," Pf. 109, 6. With the godless and 
despisers of the word he stands eternally at their right 
hand, but with the pious and faithful he may do so only 
for a time. The right hand often means in the holy 
scriptures as much as comfort and assistance. He who 
despises the word of God in his whole life shall not enjoy 
it in death. And even if the murderer and other gross 
sinners say: Oh! if only God would save me once, as He 
helped the murderer on the cross! But it shall not be so 
good for them. For because they despise the Word, 
proving themselves to be swine and dogs in their lives, 
they shall also perish in death. For Satan is at their right 
hand. But in the case of the pious and holy, this happens 
only for a time, namely when an evil thought occurs to 
them, which often leads a hundred others after it. For 
whoever gets an evil thought, nothing good comes to his 
mind. And this happens both with sins and good works, 
that they always sigh: O Lord God, how will it be! This is 
a characteristic of imperfect love. In contrast, this 
consolation takes place that he is love and tolerates our 
weaknesses. 


Fear is not in love, but complete love casts out fear. 

But who can love again as he was loved? This is, of 
course, a strange explanation in the face of reason, that 
he who loves his neighbor loves God. If man thinks it is 
necessary to ascend to heaven, as it were, and love 
God, he is instructed to love his neighbor, 


1622 


Interpretations of the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1208-1211.

that one should gladly do good, and let other people 
enjoy ours again. Therefore Christ said of this 
commandment, "The other is like unto it." And John 
learned it from him. The Gospel does not say: You must 
love God or die, but: There is another commandment 
equal to this. God knows well our weakness, therefore 
He requires of us: You shall be favorable to your 
neighbor, and let other people enjoy what He has done 
for your benefit. 


V. 19. We love God, because He first loved us. 


We are favorable to him, because his seed remains 
in us. And the saints prefer this sensation of the power 
of the divine word than if they had to govern a worldly 
kingdom. 


For he first loved us. 


50. here belongs the beautiful place from Bernhardo: 
the cup that you yourself have drunk has made you 


pleasant and amiable in my eyes. Amabile te mihi fecit 


calix, quem bibisti. It is certainly a strange thing to die 
for an enemy; for the sake of a good one would rather 
die, Rom. 5, 7. 8. 


V. 20. If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his 
brother, he is a liar. For if anyone does not love his 
brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom he 
does not see? 


(51) No one wants to forgive anything in the world, but 
rather the world likes strife, wars and rights. Therefore, 
we are liars when we say: "| love God. For in the Gospel 
it says: Here it is to give way, and not to quarrel; but 
rather to say: | will let it all lie and stand as it lies and 
stands. John takes his proof from the external senses. 
Man does not see God, but he sees his neighbor. But 
what a man knows, that he also loves. 


the most. Now, if he does not love his neighbor whom he 
sees, it is xxxxxxxx quite impossible for him to love God. 


V. 21. And this commandment have we from him, 
that he that loveth God love his brother also. 


(52) This saying applies to all walks of life and all 
times of men. Paul summarized it in these two words: 
"Be glad with the glad and weep with the weepers", Rom. 
12, 15. We also want to summarize it in two words: First, 
it means to love one's neighbor: to promote his welfare; 
second, it means to ward off misfortune and harm. 
Therefore, one does not have to be angry if one's 
neighbor is doing well, if he has received more honor, 
favors and gifts from God. So also, if | put everything to 
the worst for my neighbor, then | do not love him, but 
there is hatred, enmity, lie in my heart. But one must also 
ward off harm, [not] 1) seek advantage, not deceive in 
trade and commerce, in buying and selling. Do you say: 
| have the gospel and | am favorable to God, but if you 
do this against your neighbor, you are a liar, you misuse 
the name of God, and you will not go unpunished, but he 
will punish you with hellish fire. This is spoken against 
the carnal security. For this is a thousand times worse 
than piety, and is connected with sin in the Holy Spirit. 
For such people sin against God's mercy, saying: It does 
no harm. God is merciful. 

(53) We have heard, first, what love is; second, how 
it is divided into imperfect and perfect love, but in this 
world we cannot get beyond imperfect love; third, how it 
is to be expressed, namely, in love toward one's 
neighbor, which the apostle confirmed with a proof 
borrowed from the external senses.

The fifth chapter. 


Here now follows the conclusion of the whole letter. 
But this chapter is connected with the previous one: The 
thought sometimes occurs to the saints and the pious: 
What shall | do if | am not found among those who love 
God and their brother? John answers them and says: 
"Do not despair because of this, but believe in the Lord 
Jesus, and you will be saved. This is what all the 
apostles say, and it is fine that all twelve of them agree 
in this testimony. Works are not required for such a 
conviction, but only faith and the doctrine of justification. 
Such faith must indeed have good works, but they must 
not be used for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness of 
sins. For man would never be able to cope with this and 
would finally have to give up. Therefore, one must 
always look back to faith and the feeling of the heart. 
Complain to God, confess, seek help from Him, call upon 
Him, and you will attain repentance and forgiveness of 
sins. Above [Cap. 4, 20.] John had given a proof that was 
taken from the outward senses: "If anyone does not love 
his brother whom he sees, how can he love GOD whom 
he does not see?" What should | do now? Shall | despair 
if this love is not fully with me? No, but you should call, 
ask, complain, cry out. 

(2) There are several expressions here that need to 
be explained. First, it says: "He that believeth is born of 
God. The greatest emphasis lies partly in the name 
JEsu, partly in the fact that this JEsus is the Christ. 
JEsus, who is Christ, not only took our flesh upon 
Himself, but also bore our infirmities in it. He lived among 
us, was born in Bethlehem, raised in Nazareth, baptized 
in the Jordan, was despised and despised; he prayed in 
the garden, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass 
from me," Matt. 26:39; he cried out on the cross, "My 
Lord, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. 





God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Matth. 27, 
46, shed tears at the grave of Lazari, Joh. 11, 35. This 
Jesus is now the Christ. And this is the way of true 
justification, to believe that this Christ is the Son of God, 
although such belief, according to Paul, is an offense to 
the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks, 1 Cor. 1, 23. 

3. 2) The other expression is: "To be born of God"; 
the same occurs also in the Evangelio Johannis Cap. 3, 
3. 3, 3. and 1. ep. 3, 9. The first and natural birth is 
accomplished by divine assistance. And a child is not 
said to be born while it is still in the womb, but when it 
has come out of it. One finds a question in St. 
Bonaventure: whether such a child, whose one hand or 
foot is out of the womb, should be baptized? | say to it: 
No! For then such a child still belongs to God's judgment. 
The womb of a mother is called by David Ps. 139, 15 
"the hidden things of the earth". The pregnant womb of 
a mother does not give birth, but the human being must 
come out of this container into the world. The natural 
seed does not bear its fruit in the secret of the earth, but 
it goes out of the earth, the rain must moisten it, the sun 
must shine on it, the air must move it, it must rot in the 
earth, and then God must still give its flourishing for 
growth. This is also how it is in spiritual rebirth. The body 
does not know and does not know God. Therefore, a 
heavenly revival is necessary, God must lower pure and 
good thoughts in us. But what are these heavenly 
thoughts? These are that we believe that Jesus is Christ, 
the Son of God, and that through Him we have been 
reconciled with God. 


V. 1. He who believes that Jesus is the 
Christ is born of God. 

4 That is, such a heart is filled with holy and divine 
movements, as the Lord Jesus Himself has thus 
declared. For 


1626 


When His disciples asked Him what they thought He 
was, and Peter answered in the name of all others, "You 
are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Savior 
added, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh 
and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father 
who is in heaven," Matt. 16:13 ff. 


And whosoever loveth him that begat him loveth 
him also that is born of him. 


(5) This includes a declaration of who is the one who 
loves the Father and the Son. For he who loves God also 
loves those who are children of God for Christ's sake. 
Here, too, Christ's remark may apply: "The other is equal 
to it," that is, God does not want to be loved by us if we 
do not love our neighbor at the same time. The reason 
is this, because they are all children of God in Christ. But 
if a brother sins, we must separate his person from his 
deed. We do not cover up or excuse what is actually evil, 
but we soon show it, because we love the brothers. But 
then we must love them the most when we see the 
causes of such love before our eyes. Gal. 6:2 says, 
"Bear one another's burdens, and you will fulfill the law 
of Christ." So you love most when a burden is laid upon 
you to bear. And Christ said that he should not think that 
he is doing something special when he loves those who 
love him, for this is also what the Gentiles and all false 
Christians do, Matth. 5:45, 46. But when all kinds of 
burdens are laid on for the sake of the neighbor, shame, 
misfortune, poverty, then the false brothers flee. But 
even if our neighbor has to bear all kinds of burdens, 
misfortune, poverty and the like, he still remains a child 
of God, because God has imposed it on him. Therefore, 
| am forbidden by God not to despise God's children for 
the sake of such coincidences, or to deny them the help 
they deserve. Rather, one must awaken oneself and 
say, "Behold, my brother has a burden upon him; | will 
help him, lest he fall short when he alone must bear it. 

What did Christ carry? The cross; 


Interpretations of the | Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1213-1216. 





1627 


and this cross was our burden, a burden that was 
connected with much shame before the world. 
Therefore, this is Christ's law, that one should bear 
another's burden. But this is something rare in the world. 
The world does not use such a language of love. It thinks 
it is enough if it only gives and gives something now and 
then. But that is not deep and close enough. There must 
be a stronger motive in the heart, namely that our 
neighbor is a child, a chosen one of God. Therefore one 
should help him in all things, and say: Brother! bend 
down, | will help you carry. Examine your heart to see if 
you have ever shown such love to your neighbor. If you 
find no such love, you are not a true Christian, and you 
have cause to repent of it, and you should not boast that 
you have the true faith. It is not meant that one can only 
reproach monks and priests; likewise it is not called 
loving, that | can lend or borrow to another. But this is 
true love, when one bears another's burden; taking on 
the shame, harm, scorn and ridicule of one's neighbor. If 
this is done first, then lending, borrowing, giving, helping, 
saving can easily follow. So also Christ says: "Inasmuch 
as you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me", 
Matth. 25, 40. This is the best point. God has never 
thought of any work or help for Himself, but only for our 
neighbor. Therefore, this is the right love of the Father 
and the Son, when | consider myself less than all other 
people. We find examples of this in St. Anthony, 
Spiridion, and two pious women. Anthony wanted to be 
pious only for himself, but that was not from God; that 
meant blaspheming the Father and the Son. For being 
pious is for others. But God leads Antony out, that he 
should not be pious for himself alone, and sends him to 
Alexandria, that he should look at the life of a tanner in 
that city. He found him there living with his wife, waiting 
for his work. When he asked him, "How do you serve 
God?" he replied, "| wait for my work and do no one 
wrong; and when | get up, | say, 'Dear God, give all the 
people a chance.

degree of love was found in Christ when he said to his 
disciples [Luc. 22, 15.]: "I heartily desired to eat the 
paschal lamb with you." Likewise [Luc. 12, 50.], "I must 
be baptized with a baptism, and how anxious | am until it 
come to pass." If you do not love like this, if you are not 
so minded in your heart, you do not love God for the sake 
of His Son; therefore go to hell, or repent! 

One reads in the legend of Francisci that when he 

proclaimed on a journey that he was certainly damned, 
but his brother contradicted him and said: Brother, you 
have done so many good works, he answered: You do 
not know God; the sins are so many and so great that if 
God would act according to them, all and every one 
would be lost. St. Bernard confessed: | have spent my 
life in evil. He therefore chastised himself with fasting to 
such an extent that he became completely incapable of 
all business. However, he abandoned all reliance on his 
own works, and not only took refuge in divine mercy 
himself, but also admonished his brothers that they 
should not so mortify their bodies and wear them out with 
arduous penitential exercises. Therefore, it can be said 
that John the Baptist's rough way of life did not help him 
to blessedness. We can also cite the example of 
Spiridion and two women. They were asked by him how 
they led their lives. They answered: "We obey our 
husbands, take care of the household, sleep with them, 
bear children. Spiridion did not ask them any further, but 
said that this was a good life, and they should remain in 
their profession. Therefore, in common life, it is a love to 
believe of all others that they are children of God. 
For this reason, God Himself introduced love into the 
world and implanted it first in the hearts of the parents, 
whose impulses they also willingly follow, even if they 
have eight or ten children. And among these, they love 
the most those who are most in need of love; and these 
are either the little ones or the children. 


much about the rest, because they do not need the 
same [love’j. So nature has also given an instruction to 
attack and help carry the load. Afterwards, however, 
God has also ordered it in the whole world. Any 
occupation that a man waits for is of more use to others 
than to himself. The carpenter builds a hundred and 
more houses than the one he builds for himself. The 
farmer builds his field more for the benefit of others than 
for himself. The tailor and the cobbler make more 
clothes and shoes for others than for themselves. That 
God has revealed Himself as love even in these outward 
circumstances of life, and has planted love in the heart 
with so much wisdom, where it must actually be sought. 
The authorities serve others more than themselves, and 
a preacher is everyone's servant. Paul and Peter would 
like to be dissolved and be with Christ, but when they 
think of love, they would rather remain in the flesh, which 
would have been more beneficial for their churches. 


V. 4. For everything born of God overcomes the 
world, and our faith is the victory that overcomes the 
world. 


8 Hereby John meets an objection: Satan is too great 
and powerful! But your faith is the victory that overcomes 
him. It is said: "His commandments are not difficult." But, 
where are they not difficult? | experience it more than 
well that they are heavy. My heart is full of evil thoughts. 
When | see another's happiness, it grieves me; when he 
is in trouble, | rejoice; likewise, when | can take comfort 
in his good service or expect an inheritance from him, | 
love him. 


But what is the world? 


It has already been noted above [Cap. 2, 16] that 
three things in particular belong to the nature of the 
corrupt world, namely carnality, lust for the eyes and 
hopefulness; all of which has been explained above in 
the second chapter. The lust of the flesh actually 
consists in a preoccupation with all those things that 
belong to the present life. These lie with us

before the world. World. | would not like to be disgraced,

Overcome those who are born of God, who have divin 

thoughts in their hearts. This is how it always goes with 
the corrupt flesh, that God's commandments are not eas 

for it, but even a real cross. That is why Jesus calls them 
a light burden, especially heavy for the flesh. But John 
adds a reason why God's commandments are light.

he has a wife as if he had none. For the nature of this 
world is passing away, 1 Cor. 7, 29. ff. To the world 
belongs everything with which one deals; but a Christian 
purifies himself from it. These sentences, which have 
now been quoted from Paul, are usually given in 
German in this way: A Christian should work as if he 
wanted to live forever; and should live as if he wanted to 
die today. So John gives this general sentence as the 
reason why God's commandments are easy: He who is 
born of GOD overcomes the world. The world actually 
accomplishes what is difficult; only its inherent 
naughtiness and Satan's mischievousness make it easy 
for them. But whoever is born of God, it is easy for him 
to do good. He who has a taste for the Word overcomes 
the world. But this taste does not always last long; it goes 
away and is lost. "We are indeed children of God, but it 
has not yet appeared what we shall be," 1 John 3:2. It is 
still in fieri with us, and not in facto. Here belongs the 
eighth chapter to the Romans, in which just such a 
sense is to be found. Therefore, to go into a desert and 
solitude is not to overcome the world. If someone wants 
to attack it in this way, he must even go out of the world. 
And that is why all monasticism came into being. 


John leaves the SPeCie€S and answers only per 


QenusS: "He who is born of God. But who is the one? We 
all lack it, therefore repentance is necessary. There Paul 
also speaks in one person, and understands by it many, 
even all. God has promised grace to Israel. Do you ask: 
Who is Israel? He answers [Rom. 11, 1.]: "| am an 
Israelite." 

He overcomes the world. 

If God gives you a fair, let him be happy about it; it 
will not last forever. Temptation and temptation will come 
again. Then a saint should say: O God, make it so that | 
can bear it. Thy will be done. If this does not happen, 
you will come out of the rain into the eaves, and there 
will be trouble. Paul prayed to the Lord three times, but 
he answered him, "Be content with my grace, for my 
power is mighty in the weak," 2 Corinthians 12:9. 


1632 ‘ 


exhorted to pray that God would not let us be led into 
temptation. We do not want to ask for the avoidance of 
all and every temptation, but that He may not lead us 
into it, that He may prevent Satan, and that He may 
make His good will known to us. Rom. 8:26 says: "We 
do not know what to ask, but the Spirit of God represents 
us with inexpressible groaning." And thereby our prayer 
is answered according to our desire. Some would 
probably like to ask for that which would not be beneficial 
to them. 


V.5. But who is the one who overcomes the world? 


14 The world is called when one places confidence 
in one's own works and satisfactions, according to the 


philosophical canon: Ex actibus saepe iteratis fit 
habitus, that is, if one often repeats the same actions, 
one acquires a skill in them; item: Virtutis laus in 


actione consistit, virtue consists not in good thoughts, 
but in good actions. It is called the world when one tries 
what one can do and how far one can get with one's own 
actions. It is worldly when one thinks that God does not 
care about the human things of this life. It is worldly, if 
one considers the one to be blessed who is doing well 
here in this world, who is not in misfortune like other 
people, and who is not afflicted like other people. Ps. 73, 
5. and 144, 12. ff. The world is when everything goes 
according to our wishes, and we do not ask for anything 
else, but that it may go that way. It is the world when we 
feed ourselves with our own work, care and effort, and 
do not want to look to God. It is the world when | say: 
Everything | have is mine, and | may do with what is 
mine as | please. Now those overcome this world who 
keep the commandments of God, who are born of God, 
who believe that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, raised in 
Nazareth, crucified under Pontius Pilate, and that he is 
the Son of God. For these know that among all things 
nothing is so pleasing to God as when one holds on to 
Christ in faith, and believes that he is our righteousness; 
when one relies on his promises, does not rely on his 
own doing, and makes use of the goods of this life for 
his own and his own sake. 


Interpretation of 1 John 5:4-6. 


W. ix, 1221-1224. 1 633 
that those alone are considered blessed who, even if 
they lose everything in the world, nevertheless retain the 
important consolation that the Lord is their God, and thus 
have nothing more than a sincere hope left, which, 
however, does not let them become disgraced. 


V. 6 This is He who comes with water and blood, 
Jesus Christ, not with water alone, but with water 
and blood. And the Spirit testifies that the Spirit is 
truth. 


This place is certainly very difficult and dark. John 
introduces a testimony in it, so that he wants to testify 
that Jesus is Christ. His theme and main proposition is 
therefore this: The testimony of Jesus that he is the 
Christ, or by which it is proved that he is the Messiah or 
Christ. At the end he refers to a double testimony: The 
first is in heaven, the other on earth. Both are based on 
the fact that Jesus is Christ. Both also have three 
witnesses, because in the mouth of two or three 
witnesses there is truth. 

16 John therefore cites a testimony in order to prove 
that Jesus is Christ. This testimony is a testimony of God 
and not of man. For the Father testifies of His Son. "If 
we therefore accept the testimony of men," says John, 
v. 9, "the testimony of God is far greater, which He bore 
of His Son." But this divine testimony is twofold: it takes 
place partly in heaven and partly on earth. The one in 
heaven has three witnesses, the Father, Son, and Holy 
Spirit; the one on earth also has three witnesses, the 
Spirit, water, and blood. 

(17) Now the question is, how does this testimony 
come to pass in heaven? Some believe that this 
happened when the Father said over His Son at His 
baptism in the Jordan: "This is My beloved Son in whom 
| am well pleased," Matth. 3, 17, and on Mount Thabor 
at the transfiguration: "This is My beloved Son, whom 
you shall hear," Matth. 17, 5. Likewise, when the Holy 
Spirit descended over Him in the form of a dove. Paul 
also wrote out these words 1 Tim. 3, 16: "Great is the 
mystery of God: God is revealed. 


1634 


in the flesh, appeared to angels, preached to men, 
justified in the Spirit". But all this does not belong to the 
testimony in heaven, because it happened and 
proceeded on earth. Therefore the difficulty remains: 
How then does such a testimony take place in heaven? 
Therefore it is to be noted that such testimony belongs 
to the testimony of the Holy Trinity. Here belongs the 
saying of Hilarii: Aeternitas in patre, species in imagine, 
usus in munere [eternity is in the Father, revelation in the 
image [Christ], use in the office [of the Holy Spirit]. 1) 
Therefore this is the testimony of the Father, that he had 
decided from eternity to preserve the sinning world; the 
testimony of the Son, that he wanted to be obedient to 
his Father; the testimony of the Holy Spirit, that he 
wanted to make known the love of the Father and the 
Son to the world, and to gather, call and sanctify a church 
on earth. This, then, is the first testimony which takes 
place in heaven, and which is still more proved by the 
other testimony. For if this first testimony had not been in 
heaven, the other could not have happened on earth. 
This conclusion | draw from the word added to it, "This is 
he that cometh." For it presupposes the word that the 
one who is coming has already been before, that is, the 
one who has been in the bosom of the Father from 
eternity has come with this testimony. The three 
witnesses on earth have come, but the three witnesses 
in heaven remain. John lets them also remain. Jesus 
came to reveal this testimony to his church, as he himself 
said John 3:13: "No man leadeth unto heaven, but he 
that is from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven." 
If this is not the true opinion of these words, | confess 
that | know of no other. The testimony of the Father, the 
Word and the Holy Spirit would not be of much help to 
the world if He had not come, of whom this testimony is 
mainly concerned. What would eternity and the Father's 
eternally conceived plan help us if it had not been 
revealed to us? And the obedience of the Son, to 


1) Cf. § 23 of this chapter. 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix, 1224-1226. 





1635 


The testimony of the Holy Spirit, to which he committed 
himself to his Father, would be of no use to us if it had 
not been revealed. And so it would be with the testimony 
of the Holy Spirit, if it had always and forever remained 
hidden. We have a similarity with the sun: it spreads its 
rays, it refreshes and makes alive; the higher it rises, the 
more green and blooming everything is. It is not enough 
that this testimony be found only in heaven, but the sun 
must also touch the earth; the Sun of righteousness, 
Jesus Christ, must appear to those who sit in darkness 
and reveal it to them. 


Not with water alone, but with water 
and blood. 


These two things must remain inseparably together, 
just as both flowed at the same time from the side of 
Jesus, who died on the cross, and by this means his 
church was acquired, preserved and made fruitful. John 
gave the following account of this in his Gospel Cap. 19, 
34, 35: "One of the soldiers opened his side with a spear, 
and immediately blood and water came out. And he who 
saw it bore witness, and his testimony is true." But this 
could not have happened if Christ had not come and truly 
taken our flesh. This brief summary was kept in the 
church, that the two sacraments flowed from the side of 
Jesus, but faith was always forgotten. In addition, Jesus, 
who died on the cross, wanted to give a sign of his life, 
which was imminent for him, by the shedding of water 
and blood, and to testify his own word: "When | am lifted 
up from the earth, then you will see who | am, namely a 
true man, who will also give signs of his life in death. 

19 Against this, as a public enemy, the pope has 
declared himself, first of all, who has robbed the laity of 
the chalice in Holy Communion. John did not say that 
Christ came with bread and water, but with water and 
blood. Furthermore, the Anabaptists and sacramental 
desecrators are guilty of this crime, who have used the 
water in which Christ came. 


1636 


Christ comes to us, and do not believe that with it 
forgiveness of sins is granted. So also the 
Sacramentarians, who deny the blood of Jesus, which 
will remain until the end of the world. 

20 Augustine, in his book de meritis et remissione 
peccatorum, that is, of the merit and forgiveness of 
sins, asserted that the Holy Communion, that is, the 
Body and Blood of Christ, must be administered even to 
the now-born infants; and if it is denied to them, it must 
not be administered to the adults either, for they also 
have the Holy Spirit and belong to the Church and to the 
spiritual Body of Christ. This is what Augustine wrote and 
claimed at that time for the sake of some heretics. And if 
our heretics continue as they have done so far, we will 
have to do just as Augustine did. For in this there is no 
essential difference between the young and the old. 


The fathers called the holy supper synaxin, the table 
of the Lord, a communion of the body and blood of 
Christ. Therefore, Oecolampadius is mistaken when he 
gathers all the oerters of the Fathers and wants to 
understand the table of the Lord from the bread alone. 
The blood of Christ must be his witness in the church 
until the end of the world. 


And the spirit testifies that the spirit is truth. 


(22) Whoever accepts his testimony is sealed with it 
that God is true.

Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these 
three are one. 1) 


(23) This is the testimony in heaven, which is by three 
witnesses, is in heaven, and abideth therein. This order 
is well to be observed, that he who is last among the 
witnesses in heaven, is first among the witnesses on 
earth, and that justly. 


1) One sees from this manuscript of the blessed Luther that he 
must have had such a copy of the Greek testament in his hand, in 
which this saying was written. Since, as is known, this saying is not 
found in Luther's first translation, there is also still one of the first 
printings in the church library here, in which this saying is not read.

1637 


For the Holy Spirit bears witness in the hearts of 
believers that through holy baptism, as through the bath 
of regeneration, we are born again by the Spirit of Christ 
and by water; both of which have been purchased for 
the church and the believers therein by the blood of 
Christ. The Holy Spirit drives the testimony that there is 
a church, and in it forgiveness of sins. Hilarii's statement 
above belongs to this: Aeternitas in patre, species in 
filio 2) usus in munere. The image is Christ, in whom 
one sees the heart of the heavenly Father. The Holy 
Spirit teaches the use, that is, he teaches us to 
recognize the Father and the Son, and shows how 
salutary water and blood on earth fei. Therefore, our 
people are so bitter against today's Sacramentarians 
that they hand them over to Satan as enemies of Christ, 
because no one has ever spoken so harshly against 
God as these people, even the pope seems to be pious 
against them. The pope has never completely 
eradicated the sacrament, but only made a change in its 
nature, but these people attack the sacrament itself, 
thus eradicating the testimony along with it, yes, Christ 
Himself, and are enemies of God, who wanted this 
testimony to remain in the church until the end of the 
world. 

(24) There are many among us who want to be 
considered believers, but who will not use this 
sacrament for ten years and will not think of this 
testimony of God. If they believed in God, they would 
also believe that everything God ordained was good and 
that His testimony was irreproachable. Therefore, 
whoever believes in the truth also believes in the 
testimony of God. But those who despise God's 
testimony prove that they are unbelievers. But God also 
awakens some from their security now and then, stirs 
their conscience so that they learn to feel and sense that 
they are sinners. These are to be comforted: "There is 
gone, but still there: a sinner, a penitent. Thus one must 
comfort the awakened consciences. But the sure ones 
must be frightened and awakened to the fear of God, 
because either they are not in fear of God, or they are 
not in fear of God.

The testimony of God is not believed at all, or their faith 
is only a delusion, a dream, and not true faith. For true 
believers and children of God do not do it this way. 
Oecolampadius and Zwinglius know nothing of faith, nor 
can they admonish and comfort the hearts of believers. 
Erasmus also has no faith, although he is neither a 
Sacramentarian nor an Anabaptist. These people do not 
have the Holy Spirit, therefore they do not preach Christ 
correctly, and the hearts are not awakened to faith by 
them. And those who find no difference between 
Luther's and Oecolampadi's writings have nothing of the 
Holy Spirit either. 


V. 9. If we accept the testimony of men, God's 
testimony is greater; for God's testimony is that 
which He has begotten of His Son. 


25 This is an argumentatio a minori ad majus 


[Conclusion from the lesser to the greater. For in the 
mouths of two or three witnesses all truth exists. 


V. 10: He who believes in the Son of God has this 
testimony with Him. 

26 Above [v. 6] it was said that the spirit testifies that 
the spirit is truth. In John, Cap. 4, 42, the Samaritans say 
to the woman who brought them the news of Jesus: "We 
do not believe now because of your words: We 
ourselves have heard and known that this is Christ, the 
Savior of the world." The Holy Spirit is the truth, and also 
drives the same in the heart. He who believes 
experiences such truth better than when he is in cross 
and temptation. Whoever believes is sealed that the 
Spirit is the truth. In the cross such firmness of faith is 
not noticeable. But he is strengthened by this testimony: 
"Whatever you ask, believe, and you will receive it", 
Marc. 11, 24. | thought | was close, but in the cross | only 
learn that | am still a hundred thousand miles away. 


V. 13. These things have I written unto you, that 
ye should believe on the name of the Son of God, that 
ye might know that ye have eternal life, and that ye 
might believe on the name of the Son of God. 





The first is precisely what has already been said 
above, namely, that everything that is written and said in 
the holy Scriptures must also be accepted and observed 
in obedience. But first words are presented to us in 
Scripture; then the heart is formed according to such 
words, and from this it is recognized that they are not of 
such a nature as the word requires. This is followed by 
prayer. The Word sets before us teaching and 
exhortation. According to this teaching and admonition, 
the heart must be formed so that we may do true 
repentance and recognize the majesty of the Word, and 
thus also take refuge in prayer. The second part of this 
conclusion contains the following. For thoughts occur to 
men: If one is to pray according to his will [v. 14], how 
must this be done? Must it be done for all, or only for 
some? To this the apostle makes a distinction, saying, 
Some sin unto death, but others do not. From this arises 
a double explanation, partly what is a sin unto death, 
partly what is not such a sin. 

28 As for the first part of this conclusion, those who 
are teachers in the church must have this place at hand 
when dealing with people who are either wounded or 
troubled in heart. Such people must first be investigated 
to see if they know anything about God and His Word. 
For it is nonsense to assail such people with a few 
bushels of psalms and biblical sayings; for these people 
bear their burden, that they cannot grasp everything at 
once. Rather, one must ask them from whom they got 
their name, and one must not stop until one has an 
answer from them. For because such minds are full of 
grief, they do not like to receive an answer. But if you 
have asked them something, you must use it to penetrate 
more deeply into such a troubled person and to talk to 
him, for example, about baptism, the Father and the Son. 
If such a one answers with words of the holy scripture, 
then one should ask him: Do you also believe 


1640 


Interpretation on 1 John 5:13. W. ix, 1232-1234. 


1641 





such words? How did you feel the power of them? How 
did you experience them? How did you escape the wrath 
of God? This is the third thing, then, that such people 
should be directed to prayer. 


This is what I have written to you. 


29 Here are three things to notice: 1) | write to you 
believers to believe. A strange speech, they believe, and 
he writes that they should believe. What need is there of 
exhortation to believe, if one already believes? But know 
that faith is not always of the same kind. It is easy to say: 
| believe, but all the more difficult to experience and feel 
the faith in the heart. That is why Jesus said about faith: 
"If your faith is as small as a grain of mustard seed, it will 
be worthy to move mountains, Matth. 17, 20. Our 
adversaries, who feel nothing about the power of faith, 
laugh at us when we teach, remember and write so much 
about faith. 2) He cites the name of the Son of God as 
the primary cause through which we are to be saved. 
Paul calls it 

3) But because few attain to such 
knowledge of the name of Jesus Christ, true repentance 
is necessary. Call upon God, and you will be saved. In 
crosses and temptations it often becomes difficult to call 
the name of Christ with faith. Everyone likes to rest on 
his own good works and opinions. 

(30) But we must remember something in advance, 
before we speak of sin unto death. The teachers are to 
know whether some have been converted by the word of 
God, which they have presented in their sermons, 
because this can give them a confident courage even in 
their death. It is to be said, "So that you may believe"; 
this is to follow from it. A teacher's words are truly God's 
words. He carries a high doctrine and leads an office, 
which Christ Himself honored with it, since he was 
baptized by John in the Jordan. Servants of Christ do 
nothing out of a ruling power, nor to please any worldly 
kingdom, but only the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Therefore 
each one must confess and say: Lord, who am | that you 
have placed me in such a holy and important office? 





O Lord, my gifts are far too few for this work to be 
accomplished through me. Rule thou my heart and my 
mouth, and where | please thee not, | will rather be dumb 
and silent. But the secure people of our times take to the 
teaching office as to a handicraft, give no honor to God, 
therefore their office also comes off so bare. But this too 


is a shameful ADUSUS and abuse, that everything that is 
only evil is blamed on the Gospel and said: Is this 
evangelical? Gospel and sin must be separated from 
each other. If sin is committed, it is man who does it, not 
the gospel. A preacher should take serious care not to 
reproach the gospel, for example, through drunkenness. 
A servant and counselor of a worldly prince always 
remembers his master with reverence and treats his 
words seriously. And we want to hold the word of God in 
such an unworthy manner and treat it in a dissolute 
manner? This would be a sin against the Holy Spirit, a 
sin worse than fornication and adultery. These people 
know that they are committing sin, but the sure violators 
of the Gospel do not know it, and therefore do not repent. 
Under the pope we were forced to do all kinds of outward 
works; and now we want to earn God's grace and 
forgiveness of sins with blasphemies? At that time, we 
lived in an outward Judaism, so to speak, which is better 
than Gentile Judaism. For it received its origin and 
commandments from God, and the outward police of it 
was established by Him. But now that we are free from 
the pope, people are sinking into paganism; no one does 
anything good, no one prays. It is a proverb: When a 
thing is most unpleasant, one should love it, it will not 
last long. In the beginning, the prophets came, gawking 
toward heaven, but preaching nothing of Christ. The 
Church has received the Word and the Holy 
Sacraments, and nothing more; but who among us asks 
that the Word and the Sacraments not be so profaned? 
The pope does not want to suffer with the 
aforementioned that the name of the Son be brought 
before the Father, and that he be addressed in the same.

corner in silence to consider such blasphemies 
committed against the name of God and His Son? It 
should cheaply break our hearts. If he wanted to 
persecute us, it would be for a handful of flesh. Now that 
God sends the Turk, we well deserve it for the sake of 
our sins and great safety. Likewise, when God inflicts 
pestilence, sweating sicknesses, drought, and 
plundering upon us, it is still too little, for we do not 
repent. We also see that the word of God is cheap and 
superfluous everywhere: it is sung by the farmhand in 
the field, by the maid at the hammer; it is sung on the 
wall, on and under the bench; it is whistled, it is played 
on the organ, it is played on the lute. Consider further, 
how people are so dead and indolent for prayer, they 
even say: God will surely give it, without our request. But 
this is blasphemy. Such people mix the revealed and 
hidden will of God. The revealed will of God tells us: 
"Ask, and it shall be given you." But who has 
commanded us to inquire into the hidden will of God? 
We are, after all, Gentiles, and probably even worse than 
the Gentiles. If only we were still Jews! 1) Though none 
is good, yet this one would be better in respect of the 
outward appearance. This sentence must therefore be 
constantly inculcated. One must learn to pray: Lord, you 
have entrusted me with a pound, grant that it may sprout 
and grow, and spare my dear Lord! Finally, we have 
signs before us that almost tell us that there will be no 
church after us. There are great disruptions among the 
churches. Some have a real desire for war, rioting and 
bloodshed; they say, "When will it begin? But these are 
blasphemies, voices of Satan and murderers, who say: 
When will it begin? 


1) "If only we were still Jews!" That is, if we were still "living, so to 
speak, in an outward Judaism," as formerly under the pope. - We 
have been forced to this explanation by Rambach's remark, in which 
he erroneously states that Luther's opinion was "that it would still be 
an advantage for such secure people if they were Jews by origin" 2c. 


22:30 it says, "I sought if there were any among them 
that would stand before the breach, and make 
themselves a wall against me." 


This is what I have written to you. 


(31) John hath herewith declared what is the summa 
of all Christian doctrine, to which all those who teach 
publicly and are set over Christian churches ought to 
adhere; wherefore also he hath above already used the 
words, "These things have | written unto you. For the 
gospel is the proclamation of the word, whether it be in 
writing or orally, or with silent meditation, or in any other 
way. And this act of preaching the gospel is the proper 
worship which he ordained in his church. But John also 
adds the benefit when he writes: "These things | have 
written to you who believe, that you may know these 
things, and believe in the name of the Son of God, and 
also have life in His name." If the word of God has been 
preached plainly and loudly, then the experience or 
feeling of the heart must also come to it. But each one 
must examine himself to see whether he believes with all 
his heart, especially in the hour of trial, that what has 
been promised in the word will happen to him. 


V.14. And this is the joy that we have in him, that 
if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 


32 After the apostle has presented the doctrine of 
repentance, he now also refers to the forgiveness of sins 
as the right core of the gospel, as if he wanted to say: 
The preached word of the gospel makes up the right 
service, but the believers and saints should also adhere 
to such a service and listen to the one who has ordained 
it. Since the hearts of the faithful often feel that their 
weakness is so great that it is difficult for them to believe 
the word of God, which often causes them great fear and 
despair, it is necessary for the saints to hear the word of 
God. 


1644 


Interpretation on 1 John 5:14. W. ix, 1237-1239. 


1645 





They should pray to God and call upon the name of His 
Son to forgive their weakness. And with such a fearful 
cry, God will also hear them and receive His saints. 
Those who want to comfort and uplift the weak 
should be careful not to force faith on them in a troubled 
mind, for that would be like preaching the law and saying 
to them, "You must believe. For faith is a gift of God. It 
is almost to be feared that a person who prides himself 
on being strong in faith will not be so, but such a person 
must first recognize his sins and learn what weakness 
is. Above all, he must be reminded whether he has ever 
been moved in his heart when he hears the word of God. 


This is the fruitfulness, if we ask something 
according to his will, he hears us. 


34 This beautiful saying reminds us to deal with 
prayer, and to show 1) what prayer is; 2) how diverse 
prayer is; 3) how to pray and not to pray; 4) how far we 
are heard by God; 5) from a double sin, one of which is 
to death, the other not to death. 

35. 1) First of all, what is prayer? It is a pure, sincere 
impulse of the heart, by virtue of which man seeks to 
obtain something from God through prayer. This is a 
description of prayer that the saints experience. For 
when they have a problem, they flee to God and do not 
ask for help from others. The reason for this is that the 
Spirit of God represents them to God Himself with 
inexpressible groaning. Therefore, their prayer is an 
effect of the Holy Spirit, because they are driven to it by 
the Holy Spirit in their hearts. When God afflicts a person 
with afflictions and temptations, He attacks him in many 
ways and wants to find a way out of the distress; then 
the Spirit of God drives them to call upon God, and this 
is a very special work of the Holy Spirit, when He drives 
a person to prayer and supplication. In the schools, 
prayer has been 





that it is an elevation of the heart to God; is probably 
right, but also too weak. For the active cause of the 
prayer is not thought of, also the way and manner is not 
described in it. David prays in his Psalms: "Incline your 
ears to my speech, and let my prayer come before you," 
Ps. 17, 6. The pious Hannah prays only with the heart, 
and not with the lips, 1 Sam. 1, 13. And to pray with the 
heart is also to pray, for the true worshipers should 
worship God in spirit and in truth. Against the prayer with 
bare lips the Lord Jesus said Matth. 15, 8: "This people 
approaches me with its lips, and stays away from me 
with its heart." Therefore, to pray is not to turn over the 
leaves of the book and to move the lips. These are only 
the tools by which man can be awakened to prayer and 
encouraged in it. Eli chides Hannah about this, as if she 
were a drunken pray-er; but she answers him: "| am a 
sorrowful woman, | have not drunk wine and strong 
drink, | have spoken out of great sorrow and sadness", 
1 Sam. 1, 15. 

But why does John mention prayer here? Because he 
spoke above of the hatred, of the lusts of the world, by 
which the saints are also still challenged; therefore it 
follows that prayer is necessary. The whole armor of all 
true Christians consists in the Word and prayer. The 
word teaches us who we are and what we lack; but 
prayer obtains what we lack. 

37. 2) Prayer is of several kinds. There is a prayer for 
us, a prayer for other people. If we want to pray for 
ourselves, we must make an examination of our 
condition, how we stand in faith, and in the same we 
must also stand in the challenge. But then we will stand 
if faith, love, hope, and other gifts of grace dwell in our 
hearts. And we should be happy if even a Turk prays for 
us. But there are, unfortunately, few who pray for 
themselves, and even fewer who pray for others. For if 
someone does not pray for himself, how will he pray for 
others? And this stems from security. The latter is rare, 
but the latter is even rarer. 


1646 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. W. ix. 1239-1242. 


1647 





If we ask something according to his 
will, he hears us. 

Consequently, we are not heard when we ask 
something according to our will. We have the explanation 
of this in Rom. 8, 26: "We do not know what we should 
ask, but the Holy Spirit represents us with groaning 
unspeakable." This is a saying that is full of comfort and 
refreshment. When the heart asks, "How shall | keep 
myself in prayer? How do | know that | am asking 
according to his will? Christ says: "Ask, and it shall be 
given you", Matth. 7, 7. "Come unto me, all ye that labor 
and are heavy laden", Matth. 11, 28. For example, | have 
a sick child, father, mother, poverty, sickness, disgrace, 
or some other minor affliction that is very pressing. For 
God can make a straw as heavy as a penny, and again, 
a penny as light as a straw. Therefore, one should not 
regard a minor affliction as minor, or care less about one 
who has a minor affliction in outward appearance. 
Therefore he is God, that he can make a small suffering 
great, but a great suffering small. He does with his saints 
as he wills. This one is today, another one tomorrow. If 
someone has such a request, should | pray for him, if it 
is not according to God's will? Answer: You pray, call and 
cry out; but how it should be done, leave that to the Holy 
Spirit; he will already govern your prayer, and represent 
us with inexpressible groaning. You must pray, however, 
so that you do not lead God into temptation. For you have 
the Holy Spirit at hand, who will already make the 
condition right that we pray according to His will. Let it 
remain in the church, even if we do not always know how 
to pray, for otherwise many a troubled conscience might 
fall into despair. But Paul wants such consciences to be 
comforted. 

God hears prayer after it is truly salvific and blessed 
for each one. Paul prayed to the Lord three times when 
a stake was placed in his flesh and Satan's angel beat 
him with his fists, but he was not heard. 





but only said to him: "Be content with my grace, for my 
power is mighty in the weak", 2 Cor. 12, 7. ff. But Paul 
does not stop praying because of this, and prays quite 
confidently. This angel of Satan, as | almost believe, was 
nothing but a despair, but by no means a tickle of the 
flesh, as Erasmus explained. Paul therefore has cause 
to pray, yes, he must pray, and prays three times. What 
is it to thee, then, if dll have such evil thoughts? Thou 
hast had enough of my grace; the wicked thoughts shall 
not be imputed to thee. Weselius writes: To be tempted 
is not sin, for otherwise Christ, being tempted, must also 
have sinned. To a man who is tempted, God appears as 
angry, hell is open before him, death wants to devour 
him. These ghosts cause the saints to often say to 
themselves: | have hell upon hell, death upon death! 
These must now be comforted with this: Being tempted 
is not a sin. Just pray. It has been more salutary for 
Paulo, since he was not heard, because there the power 
of God could be accomplished in his weakness. If the 
dog is with the dog, he stays with the house and fends 
off the wolves, for otherwise the wolves will enter the 
house, overcome, and do great harm. Another example: 
Every man should think of himself, if he were always 
listened to according to his own will, then it would 
certainly go badly. But God leads it out differently than 
we intend, and He does this for the good of His faithful. 
Satan is often heard when he seeks something 
according to his will, because it happens to his 
destruction; for example, when he asked that he be 
allowed to drive into a herd of swine, Matth. 8, 31. So he 
also asked God that he might afflict Job, Job 1, 11; but 
this happens for Job's good. So when the gospel is 
preached and Satan is concerned that people believe in 
it, he rushes in with all kinds of temptations. And God 
says: You do my will, but it is for the good of my believers 
and church on earth. 

40. 3) It follows further: How far it is to pray and not to 
pray. The sin is of a double kind. First, it is a sin unto 
death. 


1648 


Interpretation on 1 John 5, 14. 17. W. ix, 1242-1245. 


1649 





Death is the wages of sin, Rom. 6, 23. Sin must be 
punished, but this punishment is death. A sin unto death 
here is such a sin over which God is so angry that He will 
not cease to be angry, and which He therefore also 
wants to punish eternally. It is the sin of which Jesus 
said: "All sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the 
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven 
men, neither in this world nor in the next", Matth. 12, 31. 
32. On the other hand, there is also a sin of which John 
says that it is not to death. So there are, as it were, two 
tables of the nature and punishability of sins. In the one 
1) table are those about which God is angry, but which 
he also wants to forgive. In the other, however, are those 
about which God is so angry that He will not forgive them 
and will not cease to be angry. Of those sins Jesus says: 
"Fornicators and tax collectors may enter the kingdom of 
God", Matth. 21, 31, but to the Pharisees He says: "Woe 
to you!" because they were guilty of sin unto death. Now 
when one prays for others, how far should this be done? 
Answer: For a sin unto death one should not pray at all, 
because it is a sin about which God is angry for eternity. 
The Church does not pray for those who deny the name 
of the Mediator, who seek neither help nor counsel from 
God, and instead rely on their own works and 
satisfactions. The pope not only eradicates the name of 
the mediator, but also defends his error. So Moses also 
prays against the Korah, Dothan and Abiram mob. Do 
not look at the sacrifice of those who are in the one table. 
Only those who are in the other table can find room for 
repentance. In that table are the sins of those who do not 
honor and recognize God as God, who do not give God 
the proper honor due to Him. But this is God's honor, if 
one fears Him, trusts Him, ascribes everything to Him, 
and does not rely on His own wisdom and power. In 


former times, when the papists held their horas 
canonicas, they used to say: "Now | want to 


1) "one" put by us instead of "first" to avoid misunderstanding. 


| will not let a goose cross the path of our Lord God. 
Therefore, one must pray only for those who do not sin 
to death; one must excuse, cover. One would like to say: 
Moses did pray for those who committed a sin unto 
death, namely for the idols who had set up the golden 
calf. "Blot me out," he says, "from the book of the living," 
Ex 32:32. Paul also did this, since he wants to be 
banished from Christ for the Jews, Rom 9:3. And 
although Stephen said to the Jews, "You always resist 
the Holy Spirit," Apost 7:51, he said, "You always resist 
the Holy Spirit. 7:51, he said afterwards in prayer, v. 59: 
"Lord, do not withhold this sin from them." Jer. 14, 11. 
12. says: "You shall not ask for mercy for this people. 
For though they fast, | will not hear their supplications." 
God also says Ezek. 14, 14: "And if Noah, Daniel and 
Job were in it, they would only save their souls." 
Nevertheless he complains afterwards that there was no 
one among this people "who would stand against the 
rift", Cap. 22, 30. This seems to argue against each 
other, therefore also this saying of John, that one should 
not ask for a sin to death, has great difficulty. | answer: 
In the case of those who preside over the church, one 
has to look at a double person: at those whom they 
present by virtue of their office, and at their own person. 
In regard to their public person they cry out and cry, 
"Woe unto you scribes!" "My soul come not into your 
counsel." They must confidently cry out, and not be 
dumb dogs. But as for their private person, they must 
pray for them in their closet: Spare them, dear Lord God, 
so that they do not fall into the hands of Satan. Moses 
thus condemns publicly, and secretly prays for himself. 
So did David, Christ, Paul and Stephen. They publicly 
speak harshly against those who do not want to suffer 
the name of the Mediator and clench their teeth about 
him. 


v.17. All unrighteousness is sin; and some 


sin is not unto death. 
This saying occurs twice. First above, Cap. 3, 4: "Sin 
is injustice," and now here again. But John has two 


1650 Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. w. ix, 1245-1247. 1651 


different words used; above dvoyia, and here adzyia. 


‘Avouia. is actually an ille 

gality and deviation from the law, by which everything is 
indicated that is against the law of God, so that all sins 
are described by it. For he who sins against one 
commandment transgresses all others, Jac. 2, 10. But 
here the apostle uses the word, unrighteousness; 


Erasmus gave it: iniquitatem. This dd1yia. is actually a sin 
unto death, for it implies that one does not seek help from 
God but elsewhere, and this unrighteousness is a root of 
all evil. In the letter to the Romans, Paul makes it the root 
of all other sins. Therefore, if hypocrites confess that they 
are not murderers, thieves, adulterers, etc., with regard 
to the other table of God's holy commandments, they 
have all the more on themselves with regard to the first 
table. It is not enough, then, to be none in the police, for 
those who do not give to God what is due to Him are 
always more like them than thieves, murderers and 
adulterers. 


V. 18. He who is born of God preserves himself, 
and the wicked will not touch him.

tov movnpoi). In German we have called it the Argen. For 
no one is worse than Satan, for from him all misfortune 
has come into the world. Matth. 5, 37. Jesus says: "Let 
your speech be yes, what is yes; no, what is no. That 


which is above is 0 to’ movnpod, from evil.” 


The Arge will not touch it. 


43) In the Greek he tries it, because according to 
Peter's description he goes around like a roaring lion, 
seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet. 5, 8. But John 
comforts him: "He will not touch him. 

44. The sins and infirmities of the saints are not sins unto 
death. They do sin, but they also have forgiveness of 


their sins. For it is said in the Creed: | believe a holy 


Christian church, a congregation of saints, forgiveness 
of sins. But no one can believe this as a saint 





liger. But because they believe this, their errors are not 
sins unto death. And why not? "Because they are born 
of God. See above the third chapter, where it has been 
treated very extensively: Who then are children of God, 
who keep the commandments of God, who are called 
righteous, who purify themselves and overcome Satan? 
Answer: "Those who are born to God", "in whom the 
seed of God abides". In this there is at the same time a 


Tamsiveoots or humiliation. The natural 
The same seed lies in the earth, you walk, you drive, you 
ride over it, it snows and rains on it. 

It preserves itself. 

(45) What is his armor, his shield, his buckler, and his 
armor, that he may preserve himself? The word of God, 
the seed that abides in him. In the 119th Psalm there are 
many descriptions of the divine word; it is called a shield, 
a light, and so on. Those who fall into temptations also 
fall into various thoughts, from which they cannot get out 
until they take the word of God to help them. What then 
can drive such evil thoughts from us_ but this 
preservation, by which we are set in safety against the 
attacks of evil? He who abides by the clear and simple 
word of God is victorious over all sects and fanatical 
people. This word is their shield and spear. In the same 
way, one must protect oneself from the great and 
dangerous security that now prevails in the world. There 


it is necessary to pray: Lord, let us have this custodiam 


[preservation]. We can see that Satan will not be quiet. 
Through the revolt of the peasants he set everything in 
motion. Then he sent the Turks. Now the disagreements 
of so many princes, republics and cities have been 
added, which all Satan needs against the chosen 
believers to touch and devour them. We must therefore 
pray, because we have reason enough to do so. For he 
preserves those who keep the word. 


The Arge should not touch them. 


46 There is an emphasis in this. He snatches at them, 
places and grasps them, but makes a mistake; and if he 
misses, then 


1652

w. ix. 1247-1251. 1653 





He throws something in the way and gives opportunity 
through the world that is in trouble. He hounds us with 
flesh, the world, sin. He invades here and there. But the 
faithful do not sin to death. Because he keeps the word 
and does not deviate from it. 


V. 19. We know that we are of God, and the whole 
world is in trouble. 


This is the right preservation of the believers: they 
know that they are of God. Above j*Cap. 4, 9] he said: 
"The Son of God came that we might have life through 
Him. Why, then, does he not impute their sins to them? 
Because he came to take away our sins. "He who is in 
the bosom of the Father has revealed it to us," John 
1:18, the language of the Father interpreted. The 
Father's saying is gibberish, no one can understand it; 
but the Son has interpreted it for us. This is a blessed 
voice that makes it possible for us to call upon God as 
our Father. 


The whole world is in trouble. 


He who knows the world will soon understand what is 
said. Here belongs the parable of the sower and the 
various fields, Matth. 13, 3. ff. Three parts of the seed 
are lost, the fourth bears fruit. Why? "The world is in 
trouble." Because the corrupt flesh is still weak in the 
race and does not do much against Satan. After that, 
Satan has all kinds of lusts in the world, lust of the eyes, 
lust of the flesh and hopefulness. There is much seed 
along the way, and on the rock, and among the thorns. 
The last part of the seed remains and bears fruit in 
patience; it takes much effort, it must die. Among them 
are those who were invited to the wedding and made all 
kinds of excuses. Pilate does not want to anger the 
emperor. Herod does not want to suffer any damage to 
his honor. Count among them the merchants, the 
tradesmen; it is almost difficult that they are not mocked 
by the world. And yet such people are safe, do not 
repent, do not consider it a sin, want to carry the soul on 
their backs for a while, then take it down again, if the 
devil, the world does not lead them away. There must 
be 


the children learn, the people in the trade cheat and lie 
that they do not speak a true word; differently offer, 
differently give. Where is the word of Christ: "Let your 
speech be yes, what is yes, and no, what is no"? 
Therefore he adds: "What is above is of evil", Matth. 5, 
37. It is a sin to death. It is the security of the world. 


V. 20. We know that the Son of God has come and 
has given us a purpose, that we may know Him who 
is true. 


This is a delicious thing. Consider Ps. 11, 72, 49, and 
if you compare them with this, you will also understand 
this saying: "How beautiful are the feet of those who 
preach good things," Rom. 10, 15. The world praises 
those who have much temporal goods, be it gained as it 
will. And why? Because it does not know that Christ 
came and brought us something better. If we were of 
God, we would strive with all our hearts to become such 
people, for the sake of Him who begat us. 


And are in that which is true. 


(50) It is a precious thing not to be mixed with the 
world; to be separated as heaven and earth, to be born 
of God, and to be at variance with the world. 


In His Son JEsu Christo. 


5U Apart from this son, there is no truth. The prophets 
have insisted on nothing but righteousness and 
judgment. But the apostles go for faith, and apart from 
such faith all is deceit and deceitfulness of vanity. 
Therefore, the apostle now concludes his letter with the 
words: 


V. 21. Little children, beware of idols, amen. 


52 Conclude thus, as he began: My little children, | 
mean well; have no other God than the one who sent 
Jesus Christ into the world. God is able to save the 
murderers, the thieves, and the murderers, and if they 
repent, He can make them blessed; but He does not 
make blessed those who honor another God, amen.

C. Two sermons on 1 John Cap. 3, 13-17.*) 


First sermon on 1 John 3:13-17. 


Held on the 1st Sunday after Trinity, June 8, 1539. 


Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world 
hates you. We know that we have come out of death 
into life, because we love the brethren. He who does 
not love his brother remains in death. He that hateth 
his brother is a murderer: and ye know that a 
murderer hath not eternal life abiding with him. By 
this we have known love, that he laid down his life for 
us, and we also ought to lay down our lives for the 
brethren. But if any man have the goods of this 
world, and see his brother brought to nought, and 
shut up his heart against him, how doth the love of 
God abide with him? 


This epistle and other epistles preached from Easter 

onward speak much of love, not only toward Christ for 
redeeming us and forgiving us of sin, but also of love 
that has received nothing, but does good and lets others 
receive forgiveness of sins and all kinds of good. The 
first love is to give thanks for the great and high good 
deed of God, that Christ became man and died for us. 
The other is when we begin to love others and do good 
to them. Whether those to whom we do good do not love 
us again should not surprise us. For it is certain that 
whoever loves God and gives thanks to Him, the world 
hates him. For the greater part is full of blasphemy. Yes, 
the whole world despises the love of God and neighbor. 
St. John speaks a lot about this love. 
"Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world is angry 
with us and hates us and would like to have us dead. 
What is more strange on earth than that people hate 
them? 





who love others there? We ourselves say, "I did not 
mean that people should be so wicked and ungrateful. 
Only look at us who have been baptized and have 
accepted the gospel, who love God for His great, 
unspeakable love, and rejoice that He has sent His Son 
to us! For this is an exceedingly great good deed, that 
he pours out his great mercy and has put his Son into 
sin, and yet we love and thank him for it weakly and 
sickly. Others, who are not yet like us in this, what do 
they do? When they hear this, they go away and 
condemn it as heresy, saying, "It should not be 
preached; but he who preaches it is the very worst. Just 
as in 1 Corinthians 4:13 we are held to be an accursed 
thing and a curse, that no one in the world should be so 
wretchedly accursed as a Christian, and especially 
those who are in the preaching ministry. So we are 
certainly already held by the pope and his followers. For 
this reason he says here: "Do not be astonished!" 

Truly, it is to be wondered at! For it would not be a 
miracle that the earth would rise up and swallow us all 
up, that we should not give thanks to God, who gives us 
His Son and makes God and man One Person, so that 
through Him we, redeemed from sins, from death and 
eternal damnation, might be brought to eternal life. Isn't 
it terrible that God should be hated more than the devil, 
and that this divine teaching should be condemned as 
error? In the prophet Micah it is said [6, 3-5]: "What have 
| done to you, my people? And how have | offended 
you? Tell me.

| brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the 
house of bondage; | sent Moses, Aaron and Miriam 
before you. My people, remember what Balak king of 
Moab intended to do, and what Balaam son of Beor 
answered him, from Shittim even to Gilgal; that ye may 
know how the LORD hath done you all good. So Christ 
also speaks to the ungrateful: Do | therefore preach unto 
thee of my benefits, that the preachers should be slain, 
and the doctrine cut off and condemned? We may well 
be grateful to God and accept the great treasure that the 
Son of God became man, suffered and died for our sins 
and rose again from the dead, sits at the right hand of 
God, and will give you all good things here temporally 
and there eternally. You see, this is why St. John says 
that the world hates God for this gift, that He gave it His 
Son. 

Dear one, do not be surprised that such things 
happen to you, and that the world hates you, who 
distribute small and poor gifts. If | have shown you love 
for a long time, | will give you a skirt or risk my life so 
that the teaching of the gospel will be known, preached, 
spread and confirmed by me. But even if | give all my 
possessions for the sake of God and die for you, so that 
you may be strengthened in the knowledge of God, you 
will not be saved. Therefore 1) it is a stinking, nasty love 
compared to the love of Christ, because he dies and 
redeems you from eternal death through his death. What 
wonder is it, then, that one should be disgusted with Him 
through whom we are saved, if God the Father gets 
ungrateful people for His great good deed in putting His 
Son to the shameful death of the cross? Truly, here you 
will not be allowed to be very proud that people will be 
ungrateful to you. For you are far from being Christ. So 
you cannot give such great gifts as he does, even if you 
commit yourself to death for the sake of another man's 
salvation. For this unworthiness of yours is swallowed 
up by the fact that God did not spare His own Son. 


1) "Accordingly" put by us instead of: "Nevertheless". 


Two sermons on 1 John Cap. 3, 13-17. 





1657 


But why does the world hate you? The same he says 
just before this text, that their works were evil. A good, 
beautiful and right thing, 2) that the murderer and death- 
slayer is bad and evil, and he who does good deeds is 
good and pious, lives honestly in the worldly 
government, and is upright in his housekeeping. A 
prince punishes evil and hangs a thief on the gallows for 
his theft. Such punishment of evil is right. But the world 
is such a herb that hates those who do good to it. 
Therefore he says, "Marvel not!" 

But what is it called? How should it be painted? The 
world is called Cain, the good mother Eve. When she 
gave birth to the first man, she gave him a name with 
great joy and hope, saying [Gen. 4:1], "| have the man, 
the LORD." She had seen no man young before, should 
not the first be glorious and lovely? He is the first dear 
fruit of the human race. Cain, that means, possession; 
as if she should say: | have got the right treasure, the 
right property. She pronounced herself blessed. And 
Cain will have noticed it too, thought: It is |, and 
condemned his brother: Ei, he is not the first, but the 
other. My name is Cain and not Abel. Cain, the first one, 
is the one, the other one nothing. Abel is called vanitas, 
which is void and vain, since there is nothing behind it. 
Cain is nothing. 

All here she has painted 3) the world. Cain is a squire 
and everything; because the world also wants to float up. 
But Abel must be Cinderella and nothing; that is the 
Christian church. My brother, says Cain, stinks before 
me and is called Abel, that is, nothing at all. This 
hopefulness has also overthrown him, so that he has 
fallen into misery and killed his brother. Both parents 
loved their first son, especially Eve, who gave him his 
name. When he grew up and thought that he should be 
a savior who should save from sins, death, the devil and 
hell, the rude young man Cain, the right heir, sacrificed 
and brought a good sacrifice. Abel, he is a poor 
shepherd. The Jews say that Cain sacrificed a sheaf of 
grain, therefore 


2) Here the text is undoubtedly corrupted. 
3) The subject of this sentence is probably "the Scriptures". 


1658 


Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. 


1659 





He was rejected, but Abel brought a lamb. But when they 
sacrificed, fire fell from heaven and burned the sacrifice. 
This was a sign of God's grace. So Abel's sacrifice went 
and burned. But Cain's grain was not eaten. This was an 
indication that Cain was rejected by God. From this came 
the hatred that he could not forgive his brother. His 
parents said to him, "Why are you disguising yourself 
against your brother and behaving so badly? But he would 
not accept it. For his name was Cain, and he thought that 
he alone had done it; and it displeased him, because he 
was a proud and haughty man, that he should not be all 
that he was. 

This is the name of the world, namely Junker Cain, 
who has it all. Therefore we must not be surprised if the 
world hates us. It has been so from the beginning of the 
world and will remain so. Those who are, do not have to 
be, and those who are not God's friends, even want to sit 
in his lap. But it shall be so, as it was said of the patriarch 
Jacob [Gen. 25, 23.]: "The greater shall serve the lesser." 
Abel, the pious child, believed in God, thanked Him, did 
not want to harm or hurt his brother, hoped that God would 
bring into the world the future seed in which he and all the 
world would be blessed, loved his brother, served him and 
made a good example of Cain, that he also believed in 
God and thanked Him. But he remembers: God owes it to 
me. | am the firstborn. Therefore the Lord will look at me 
and say to me: Welcome, Squire Cain! will not accept 
anything from others, but only from me, Cain. 

Thus the world does for and for. Therefore, it is also 
grateful to God for the sake of the highest good. Look at 
the highest examples. First, the Lord Christ; then Abel and 
Cain. He had no other occasion or cause for his brother, 
except that his works were good and that he pleased God. 
This is still the case today. What did the apostles sin? Did 
they grab their sword from the authorities, steal, commit 
adultery and fornication, or rob in the streets? No, but they 
prayed, preached the gospel that, 


Whoever would be saved should believe in Christ and be 
baptized, and on the other hand condemn and destroy 
idolatry and idolatries, since 1) they could not help 
anyone. Therefore hold on to 2) faith! Since the apostles 
wanted to save the world from death with this teaching, 
they were killed for the sake of the good work. To this 
our Lord God should have said: Yes, what you have 
done so far pleases me. Just clean up the fishermen, the 
apostles, quickly. 

That is why the world and all those in high places 
cannot stand the truth, and they give one advice after 
another, and there is no end to it. They think they do not 
have to see us. They have a painted glass in front of 
them, so they do not think otherwise; we do not see 
anything either. We preach the faith in Christ, just as the 
little children do, which they also confess with words, 
without us adding: 3) If Christ, who became man and 
died for us, does it, so do not the saints, the orders, the 
brotherhoods, pilgrimages and masses. It is because 
Cain's sacrifice, done in unbelief, becomes a mere hope, 
and is of no use. Otherwise, they could have more than 
we have, if only they would drop their Cain worship and 
accept Abel's worship, that they would thank God that 
He is a gracious God and shows an unspeakable mercy 
and love to us, that He gives us poor sinners 
blessedness without all our merit and worthiness, only 
for the sake of His dear Son. Ei, they say, what should 
this harm me [that | call on the saints, accept an order 
2c.] ? 4) They will not take away my life. And because 
Abel's works are good, and Cain's evil, therefore the 
noise is raised. The world does not want to leave its 
idolatry and does not want to accept faith. They do not 
want to suffer the word of God that one should believe in 
Christ alone, but force and drive people to leave the 
bright, loud and clear word of God and follow their Cain 
works.

several times: before "therefore" there was a period, before "we" a 
comma, before "without" a period. 

4) Here the relation is again extremely poor, so we have added. 


1660 


The devil is so mighty and powerful that he deludes 
people. So mighty and powerful is the devil that he blinds 
men, that they ask nothing of their salvation, when they 
should accept it with thanksgiving. For great benefits are 
offered to them, and nothing is taken from their goods. 

Now the world is called Cain, that is, a great lord, and 
the world is the devil himself, and its members and whole 
race are Cain. But the Christian church, the Abel, that is 
nothing. The pope and emperor - starting from the top to 
the bottom - are the great Cain, who is everything, are 
mighty, rich, wise, holy, they do not lack intellect, they 
want to be lords over heaven and earth. They are the 
most beautiful bunch, have the greatest power, are the 
most learned, and also know that they are learned in all 
kinds of arts. 

Teach, then, what their manner is, and what their 
color is, by which they may be known, namely, that they 
are angry with Abel, and kill for his good works. But if you 
weigh Cain and Abel on a scale, you will find one or two 
pious emperors, pious kings, princes, and also some 
pious noblemen, citizens and peasants. These are Abel. 
The others are all Cain, especially the bishops and 
cardinals. For the world is the devil's kingdom, in which 
he reigns. So they cannot stand that the despised Abel, 
that is the Christian crowd, should preach that we are 
saved by God's grace and mercy alone, and that the 
"pope's sacrifice at Mass should not count for anything. 
Thus the world is of the best mind, as far as the soul is 
concerned, in the first table; the same also in the other 
table. And if they are not concerned about the first table, 
yet in lesser matters, they exert all courage, press and 
hate Abel, not only in the first table for the sake of the 
sacrifice, but also for the sake of temporal goods. One 
brother does not allow the other to eat a morsel. 

In the first table this is the wickedness of the world, 
that they despise God and his word, there the services 
are not right for them. Then the world enters the other 
table, disobeys parents and overlords, does not honor 
them, murders, steals, robs, commits fornication. This is 
the color of the world. In the first commandment 


Two sermons on 1 John Cap. 3, 13-17. 





1661 


Christ is also understood. Therefore, because the world 
does this, do not think: "My dear, should all emperors, all 
great men, the best and brightest on earth be mistaken? 
If the world is to be respected by reputation, 1) then they 
consider themselves princely and noble. But this is 
terrible, that they are so bitter, poisonous, evil against the 
word of God, and for no other reason than because it is 
Abel, that is, that one does not want to let it be good what 
they sacrifice. One would still be astonished at this: They 
are the best people, wise, learned, just before the world. 
And it cannot be otherwise: If people are to have peace, 
they must be allowed to be the best, and we must be put 
under their control. Then they say, This is the most noble 
and learned man, and yet he is Cain, who wants to have 
everything, even to be the most wise. Abel shall be 
nothing and have nothing, and yet this being of the world 
shall please God. 

For this reason, St. John preaches much about love, 
that we should take care and not be Cain, but Abel. Let 
him be a lord of the world, wanting to be and have 
everything. But we are called vain and nothing in 
comparison with him. He is everything; nevertheless, 
since 2) we love God and our neighbor (even if Cain 
beats us to death over it), 3) we should forgive him, ask 
God to forgive his sin, and not seek revenge. For we are 
to love our neighbor, but especially God. We love and 
thank God for having mercy on us. We grumble at the 
ingratitude of the world. It is not surprising that we who 
preach the truth are not well received. He who speaks 
the truth is hated, and woe to him who helps another from 
the gallows. The ghouls themselves have experienced 
this. 

The world is a thief, redeemed from the cross, how 
much more in the high thing it does not understand, than 
when it crucifies Christ, who nevertheless saved it from 
death. For this reason, we are a little accustomed. When 
you preach in the first tablet that everyone must believe 


1) "according to the appearance" put by us instead of: "according 
to the soul". 

2) Buchwald: that. 

3) These brackets are set by us and a second "nevertheless" is

1662 


in Christ, then it is no wonder that Cain is sorry for you. 
And if you serve one and do good, and he gives you all 
the malice in return, do not be mistaken. These are the 
works which the Lord Christ himself did, of which he says 
[John 14:12], "He that believeth on me, the works that | 
do shall he do also, and shall do greater works than 
these," and [he that doeth them] shall lose them 1) also. 
The world [does works and] wants to earn thanks with it. 
One should love and cannot do otherwise. If it can 
happen to her, she accepts it. If not, then it begins to 
blaspheme, to thunder and to flash. This is the way of the 
world. If you know a thing beforehand, you must not be 
surprised when it happens to you afterward. For the 
people who are called the world cannot do otherwise. And 
yet you must live with them, and preach the first table, 
even if you die over it, 2) and in the other table do them 
all good; but they shall carry wood and fire. 

So learn to distinguish the world and the Christian 
church. Cain is a nobleman and everything, Abel is a 
Cinderella and nothing. This is how it is painted in the 
Holy Scripture. Look at all the examples from the 
beginning of the world, how great the ingratitude of the 
world is. But therefore the spring of doing good shall not 
fail. Be a good tree that bears fruit, and though the apples 
and pears fall from it and are eaten by a sow, yet it does 
not cease to bear fruit, or though a wicked wretch cut off 
a branch, yet it is not made wicked for that reason. 
Therefore we should not let ourselves be made wicked, 
so that we become ungrateful because of their 
wickedness. For we know that we have come out of death 
into life. He speaks plainly and badly, but he uses it 
masterfully: 

"We know that we have come out of death into life." 
Do not be surprised! We have enough of it! Even if they 
are ungrateful to us, it is enough for them. 


1) Buchwald: "und wird's auch verlieren". The bracketed words 
are added by us.

Interpretations on the 1st Epistle of St. John. 





1663 


Harm, and not us. 3) We have come from death to life. 
How do we know this? Hence, "For we love the 
brethren." But yet we teach that God so loved us that we 
did not begin before Him. Then we also begin to love not 
only God, but also our neighbor. So, when Christ died 
and rose from the dead, he also begins to love, sooner 
than | love him. If | only believe this, then love begins, 
that | thank God and love Him from the heart. And after 
that | also love my neighbor and do good to him, even if 
he becomes ungrateful to me. 

Therefore he says: "We have come out of death into 
life, because we love the brethren. He clearly says: "We 
have come out of death through Christ. There is a great 
emphasis in this word. We know that St. John wrote this 
epistle against the false Christians. He speaks of the 
effect, not of the cause. For there are many who boast 
that they are Christians, and confess that they are 
cleansed by the blood of Christ and brought out of death 
into life, and yet they remain in the old Cain. For they do 
no good or service to their neighbor, and prove not the 
works and fruit of faith. Therefore there is no love. 
Therefore we must know that we have been saved from 
death, so that, as St. Peter says [2 Pet. 1:10], we may 
make our profession sure by good works, that you may 
be a righteous Christian and chosen for the kingdom of 
heaven, that you may not remain in doubt and lead in 
the mouth alone, saying, "! believe," but make it sure, 
not only in your heart but also before all men. 

What St. Peter said about making the profession 
certain through good works, St. John says: through the 
love of the brethren. For if you love the Christians, your 
brothers, then you know that you have been brought into 
life through faith, which redeems from death. We always 
preach about this, that faith justifies. But by this | learn 
and know whether faith is true or colored. If it is a colored 
faith, one remains in hatred, in avarice, in drunkenness. 


3) Buchwald: "in us".

and other sins, and such nevertheless go to the 
sacrament, but are nevertheless hopeful, favorable 
people and nevertheless boast of the faith and their 
Christianity. But the heart never knows that you are a 
believer. Neither does God nor his neighbor know it. The 
word is preached [Marc. 16, 16]: He who believes is 
saved; but see that you make it certain. By what? By 
loving your neighbor. Every man look to himself! 

He does this with many words, with four or five signs, 
by which one can recognize whether the faith is true. 
One should love so that one also dies for the other. 
Whoever does not do this remains in death and is a 
death thrower. He also puts it in the other tablet: "But if 
aman have goods of this world, and see his brother die, 
and shut up his heart against him, how doth the love of 
God abide with him? How can he know that he has been 
brought out of death into life, or that he is a Christian, but 
he is sure that he is Cain and not Abel. If he does not 
want to offer this life's goods for a Christian and reach 
out to him, how should he want to die for him? If he does 
not give him a morsel of bread, he will not give his head 
for him, just as the rich man does in the Gospel [Luc. 
16:19-31]. If these are sure that they are Cain, where will 
those remain who torment others, torture them with 
robbery and plunder, give nothing to anyone, and harm 
others with robbery in public and with secret practices. 
They are not brethren, but Cain, not only in the first 
board, but in the other board, as the whole world knows 
them. Nevertheless, they want to be Christians and 
stand firm in the Christian faith. But you are not a 
Christian because you say: | am; but you must make it 
certain. They all cannot say, "We know that we have 
come out of death into life." Therefore no one should 
adorn himself by saying, "I believe | am saved from 
death," and yet harm others, or be proud, angry, or 
revengeful. If you are a brother, help your neighbor, so 
that, if it is from

If you were in need, you would also fight for him. It is true 
that many are ungrateful. Nevertheless, Christians give 
alms because otherwise pagans would not do so. 

That is why the devil sends those who pose as poor 
beggars and steal our alms. But we must do as Moses 
says, that we may see who is in need, or if any lie in a 
whore, and work not, but revel. If someone is known and 
poor, and would like to work, but the work is not enough, 
then you are obliged to help, or you are still in death. If 
this were done, any city would be well provided for, if it 
knew who was poor. If not, heaven is closed and hell is 
opened, and belongs to Cain, not to Abel. 

Strange beggars often come, bringing letters from 
other places. But the council sees to it that the letters 
are not false. But who belongs to the parish, we should 
attack ourselves, not let everything go over the common 
box. These are the elect Christians, who not only 
believe, but also prove their faith and know that they are 
Christians and let others know it too. The godly do good 
works, but the oppressors give all things dearly. All 
craftsmen who help 1) with too. | hear now that a candel 
of beer is given for 4, 5 and 6 pfennigs. Be careful! Is 
this love? You want to die for your brother? And your 
poor brother shall be so esteemed by you? There will be 
thunder and lightning. All the prophets cry out about the 
weight, scales and cubits. God does not want people to 
translate in purchase. They hang petty thieves on the 
gallows, and you steal a penny or two in a barrel, where 
is the gospel? If you want to be Cain, be it and kill us 
too! If you deceive us, you will not deceive God. But if 
you want to be a Christian, be sure to do your job, and 
know that you prove your faith by your good deeds 
toward your neighbor. But we do the opposite, rob and 
steal.

Second sermon on 1 John 3:13-17. 


Held on the 2nd Sunday after Trinity, June 15, 1589. 


(Continuation of previous sermon.) 


We heard next Sunday about love, that we should not 
be surprised, and about Abel and Cain. So also is the 
world, as it is painted here, that it should hate, envy the 
little heap of Abel, and that we should not marvel at it. 

Now follows [v. 14]: "He who does not love his 
brother remains in death", and these will lack the 
kingdom of heaven and eternal life. For they are slayers 
of death. We also see how it works that those who accept 
the word of God and use all the good deeds of Christ, 
and yet are false Christians, not only remain in death, but 
also become death-throwers. As all the false spirits from 
the time of the apostles have proven, they taught so 
wrongly and unjustly and led the people into murder and 
hatred that one killed the other. But it is frightening that 
among Christians there are not only those who boast of 
the Christian faith and yet remain in death, but are also 
death-slayers. But St. John says: "Do not be surprised!" 
It is to be wondered at that under the teaching of the 
Gospel Christians not only remain dead, but are also 
death-throwers. 

And it is their much now such clever ones who 
pretend: | see nothing good that comes from this 
teaching. People are now evil, stingy, lewd. We want to 
start another one, which is better! So you could say to St. 
John and St. Paul, why the teaching is so ineffective and 
has little effect, if it is so holy and good, that such evil 
people find and Cain still stirs; should the teaching make 
people devout: what good comes from the teaching? 
What did you hear in the Gospel today? 2) Lazarus died, 
the

sermon was preached on the first Sunday after Trinity, because the

rich man has Moses and the prophets and yet he goes 
to the devil [Luc. 16, 19-31]. So they also say here: 
People are spiteful, envious. But is this the fault of the 
gospel? If you hear such people, tell them: What good 
shall come of it? You shall have harm from it. Just as 
nothing good comes out of Moses and the prophets to 
the rich man and his five brothers, but hellish fire: so shall 
it come out of you. 

So John also preached faith in Christ and love for 
one's neighbor; yet the world hates and Cain hates the 
brothers. If | want to conclude that people are evil, 
therefore the teaching is false, | must also conclude: 
Where then do harlots come from? God has blessed the 
bride and the bridegroom. What good comes from the 
marriage state? Harlots and knaves. Egg, therefore the 
marriage state is evil. Where did the devils come from? 
Is it not true, from the highest choir of angels? Where do 
tyrants come from? Isn't it true, from the princely state? 
So often from the best comes the worst. So, from angels 
come devils, from virgins come whores, from wives and 
widows come adulteresses. Therefore tell such blind 
men not to see. It is also forbidden them, as it is written 
[Isa. 26:10], "They see not the glory of the Lord," and in 
Psalm [115:5], "They have eyes, and see not; they have 
ears, and hear not." They shall become like them who do 
such things. Such drops, which have painted eyes, 
golden, silver eyes, they shall also see nothing. Aristotle 
says: "If aman gets a picture in one eye while the picture 
lasts, he sees no other; so it is also when you look 
straight at a letter. So it is also with such people, who 
have silver eyes and hearts. The heart is money. 
Therefore the eyes are also unclean, like those: "They 
have eyes, and do not see" what God wants. 


1668 


He works and does good by his word and order. And yet 
they have a whore in their eyes. For this reason they all 
judge the others in the same way. Then they hear that 
Christ shed his blood. But it is nothing to them. They see 
nothing else but gold and silver. As their heart is, so is 
their eye. Now that they are blind, it is no wonder; and 
say to them: | am not surprised that thou sayest, There 
is nothing good in the doctrine. By this | perceive that 
thou art blind. An image also has eyes, but it does not 
see. | prophesy to you here that you do not see here 
either. 1) | prophesy to you here. 

So Nothing Good Comes From Doctrine] 2) speak 
the rude dolts. But say thou unto them: It is thus written 
[Ps. 115, 5, ff.], "They have eyes, and see not; they have 
ears, and hear not; they have noses, and smell not; they 
have hands, and grasp not." And therefore also here St. 
John says: "Do not be astonished." For these are the 
ones in whom the word of God produces no fruit. | also 
see that people become evil, and it hurts me. But in the 
meantime | see the fruit of the good gospel. The fault is 
not of the divine word or its works, but yours. See how 
the chair of preaching, baptism, the altar, the council 
house and the marriage bed remain in honor, the 
authorities in their rule, the citizen and the peasant, and 
the veil and the little hat remain pure: truly, | want to 
show you the fruit and benefit of the divine word. Truly, 
in the word of God, praise is given, honor is given to 
God, as otherwise one worshipped the Virgin Mary, St. 
Christopher, George, and the devil himself before. Let 
this be to thee a glorious fruit, greater than heaven and 
earth, that God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit be one 
God, that Christ be crucified and die, and that God's 
works not be condemned, that God be praised in His 
mercy, and that He cast the rich man into hell with his 
brothers, and make Lazarum blessed by grace, item, 
that we may follow the right custom

of baptism, the Lord's Supper and absolution, item, that 
each one may know in his order and standing that his 
profession is pleasing to God. Now if the great multitude 
and Cain are wicked, shall this be the fault of the 
doctrine? St. John says it is the fault of the world. Should 
it also be said that the married state and virginity are not 
good, for there are many harlots among the virgins? 
What thief wants to be a thief, if he was a pious child in 
the cradle? What is the guilt there? They have eyes, that 
is, they are blind, they have eyes of gold and silver, like 
an idol. Therefore it is not necessary for you to boast. 
You see, if we could separate the world from the 
Christians, the matter would be settled soon. If the 
whores were driven out of the city, we would have pious 
women and virgins. How shall we do it? It is mixed. The 
Lord Christ himself says: "Again, the kingdom of heaven 
is like a net cast into the sea to catch all kinds of fish. 
But when it is full, they draw it out to the shore, and sit 
and gather the good ones into a vessel; but the rotten 
ones they cast away." Item [Matth. 13, 24. ff.], there are 
tares growing among thy corn. - But there come the 
foolish, saying, Yea, | see no good thing coming out of 
the doctrine, therefore there is no church. You say, "You 
are a shabby devil! 

But | have said, An idol that is golden, even as they 
are, shall see nothing; and so they judge and judge 
themselves. Thus it is, that thou shalt see no good thing. 
Thou sayest thou seest not, and in this thou hast a sure 
sign that thou art blind. But that there is no fruit of the 
divine word, thou liest in thy throat. For God has said 
[Isa. 55:10 ff]: "As the rain and the snow fall from 
heaven, and return not thither; but wet the earth, and 
make it fruitful and increase, that it may give seed to 
sow, and bread to eat: so shall the word be that 
proceedeth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me 
void, but shall do that which | please, and shall prosper 
when | send it." For God did not give His word to the 
world to be unfruitful, but to be used as a 


1670 


Rain makes the land wet. Therefore, judge not by the 
outward appearance, but by the Word of God, so that the 
chair, the sermon and the altar may remain pure. See if 
there are not pious Christians, pious spouses, authorities, 
citizens and peasants. Do you then say: O, they are few! 
Yet they are. Is everything under the pope a holy thing? 
Do they not have many whores there? Item, the priests 
slept with the citizens' wives, daughters and maids, 
cheated the people with indulgences. The evil under the 
papacy is not seen now. Therefore, they are vain idols 
who do not see the abominable blasphemy and shame 
under the papacy. So blind and ungrateful are we that 
men speak such words, when we are much given to 
another. Truly, we do not worship idols now, do not 
respect indulgences and purgatory, nor do we go on 
pilgrimage. The dirt is gone. But we honor the Father in 
the Son. Let them not see the good that is here, and the 
evil that is with the pope. For "they have eyes, and see 
not". They shall not see how gracious is the word of God, 
and how abominable are the doctrines of men. Shall you 
then then speak: | see no good thing? And see all evil 
there, and yet not condemn it, but defend it? For they are 
idols that cannot use any of their members. Augustine 
often uses the saying: The wicked shall be rejected, 
because he does not behold the glory of God. What God 
ordains, that is, they shall not see, nor be able to speak 
of it, that one preaches and the people listen gladly, that 
one baptizes children and absolves, and comforts 
afflicted sinners, and that man and woman live chastely 
with one another. They should not see this, but only look 
at the secret chamber. Again, where the devil is black, 
and the pope is ugly in front and behind, they shall not 
see. 

You Christians may well give thanks for the unspeakable 
grace, which no reason can grasp, that the light has 
dawned and we recognize Christ. It was a great shame in 
the papacy that one should mention the name of God or 
of the Lord Christ JEsu in the pulpit in sermons. For it was 
considered

for a vetzagte, feminine speech, but you had to name 
the Aristotle, the Fathers, Concilia. But now you have 
the divine word in the church. This preaches Christ with 
great fruit. Now let the theologians be equally wicked, 
pay no attention, even if a prince were a tyrant or a 
whore were found among the Christians. They are ten 
times worse among that crowd, and still today. 

The fathers, the apostles wanted to improve it, made 
decrees, canons, seven years of penance 1) and that 
the priests do not take wives. How it was done, read the 
church histories. First, they forbade women; then they 
commanded that they take their mothers and bases to 
themselves. But this was also forbidden to them 
afterwards. Again they were allowed to take the bases, 
mother, father sister, 2) to themselves. But they did it in 
such a way that they also had to forbid their own sister. 
How does that sound to your ears? It was truly a sign 
that they slept with them. Then they also forbade them 
their mother and allowed them to keep boys alone. How 
well did they do? They fell so low that a priest was not 
allowed to have his own sister and mother with him. But 
if he had his own wife, his mother and sister could 
remain free. They would have left the canons outside in 
the name of all devils and said: Take a wife and be "a 
wife's husband", as the holy scripture says [1 Tim. 3, 2]. 

Now they say, "Well, it would be fine for someone to 
be without a wife. Who would not wish that every man 
should remain a virgin; but before he should keep a 
whore, it is better to be legitimate. The word of God has 
always been preached among the good and the evil. 
Behold, how good it was when the pope with his own 
had to forbid the priests wives and mothers, and then 
one might keep more than two, three or four whores and 
have another every week! 

Where God's word does not help, you will not achieve 
much with your shabby canons.

ten. But those who wrote the canons were not 
concerned about that. Moses, the prophets and the 
apostles were also people. Only always say: You are 
one of the small pieces of wood, since one makes sauté 
troughs. Say: [Do not be surprised that the world hates 
you." Whether false teachers and wicked men are found 
in the word, see only what fruits the word produces, and 
not how the people become angry. It is not the fault of 
the Word, or of the Lord's Supper, or of baptism, that 
there are harlots and knaves, tyrannical nobles and 
princes. Marvel not: Cain and the world remain what 
they are. 1) They become vain ruffians, who would 
amend and make it worse; as, the Anabaptists became 
rioters and murderers. That was the reform! Muenzer did 
not want to be with us, because there were many evil 
people mixed among us, and he wanted to make it 
better. So did Zwingli. Item, the pope and the canonists 
with the doctrine of celibacy. It is finely improved that the 
priests have become the most shameful people and 
have done such disgraceful things that one cannot call 
it that. They have filled the world with idolatry and false 
worship. 

In Augustine's time the Donatists stood up; they saw 
that the people were stingy and envious. Therefore they 
separated themselves and wanted to be a select, holy 
people: and they became such murderers that they beat 
and strangled themselves to death among themselves. 
When one said to another, "Dear one, strike me dead so 
that | may become a martyr," he pushed him off a rock 
so that his neck fell in two. Such blind men become 
blocks; they want to look for another place where it will 
be pure: and then it becomes what happened to the 
Mint, the Anabaptists and the Anabaptists. Nothing will 
come of it in this world, that the evil and the good should 
be separated from each other. God has given princes, 
authorities, schoolmasters, parents, who should ward 
off evil. Nevertheless, wickedness is not left. The world 
is evil. Item, Adam's child, Cain, is not pious. 

Nevertheless, this is the fruit of knowing God from His 
Word, and, like the 


1) "Remain who they are" put by us instead of "who she is". 


111. Psalm [v. 2. f.] says: "Great are the works of the 
Lord; he who respects them delights in them. What he 
ordains is praiseworthy and glorious; and his 
righteousness endures forever." God is praised by his 
true knowledge. Item, he blesses the marriage state, the 
grain in the field, gives pious citizens, farmers. These 
things are seen by those who are enlightened by God's 
word. But that others see much evil and wickedness, 
that was also the case before. Cain wants to be greater 
than Abel. You also have such eyes as Cain. But if thou 
love the brethren, we shall not abide in death, neither kill 
any man; and must "love not in word, nor in tongue, but 
in deed and in truth" [1 John 3:18]. 

But Cain does the opposite. If we were all pious, 
there would be no need for this perception. But if we 
love, we are alive, we will not kill anyone, and we do not 
love with our tongues. The wicked do the opposite. 
Therefore we should not be surprised that the saints 
who dwell in the house are condemned, and the 
sojourner who stands at the door is saved. Well, you cry 
out: | see nothing good in Moses and the prophets. 
Right! What should you see? You are a silver, gold or 
wooden image or block. You confess that yourself. But 
a Christian sings thus [Ps. 111, 3-9]: "What God ordains 
is praiseworthy and glorious; and his righteousness 
endures forever. He has established a memorial of his 
wonders, the gracious and merciful Lord. He giveth food 
to them that fear him: he remembereth his covenant for 
ever. He proclaimeth his mighty works unto his people, 
that he may give them the inheritance of the nations. The 
works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his 
commandments are righteous. They are kept for ever 
and ever, and are done faithfully and honestly. He sends 
a salvation to his people; he promises that his covenant 
shall endure forever. Holy and holy is his name." For we 
have the word of God, baptism, the Lord's Supper, 
absolution, know what the married state is, how virgins 
live, and how all other states please God. But they are 
not all pious! Nevertheless, he is there, and Christians 
are there and his estates. They also do not use

1675 





all of the Gospel and the Lord's Supper! Nevertheless it 
is there! 

In Turkey, there is none of these, not even the 
marriage state. For the Turk takes a wife today, 
tomorrow he sells her again, does not see the divine 
order. But we preach that man and woman are given to 
each other by God. Item, we have master and servant 
status. In Turkey there is no manservant and 
maidservant, but vain cows and swine that they sell. 
They are not masters, but devils. But we may well thank 
God that we live among the multitude, where the Gospel 
is preached purely, where God's Word, the Sacraments, 
God's order, and God's ranks are. Even if not all of them 
are pious, God's order is still here, which is beautiful and 
glorious. And His commandment and order are kept, not 
only in preaching, but also in His ordinances and 
estates. Therefore say to them: We see well that thou 
seest no good thing. 





For you confess that you are a silver and gold man, and 
have painted eyes, and the devil has possessed your 
heart. If you were not blind, you should say, "Thank God 
and praise be to God! It is true that there are many 
wicked ones; nevertheless, the sermon is holy, baptism 
and matrimony. Where God's word and work is, there it 
does not go unpunished. So every godly person sees 
that God is not idle. For where his word is, there is also 
his work. But because you do not hear his word, you do 
not see his works. It seems to you that in the papacy the 
Virgin Mary was worshipped and mass was celebrated. 
It was of the devil, vain idolatry. Yet here they say that 
God's works are filth, brought forth by the devil. They 
betray themselves by losing their hearts and ears. But 
we want to preach and practice the word and thank God 
for this unspeakable treasure and ask Him not to take it 
from us. 


D. D. Martin Luther's sermon on 1 John 4:16-21. *) 


From 


love. 


Delivered at Trinity in 1532; printed in 1533. 


1 John 4:16-31. God is love, and he who abides in 
love abides in God, and God in him. In this love is 
fully with us, that we may have joy in the day of 
judgment. For as He is, so are we in this world. Fear 
is not in love, but complete love casts out fear. For 
fear has torment. He who 


but fears, he is not complete in love. Let us love him, 
for he first loved us. If anyone says, I love God, and 
hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not 
love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God 
whom he does not see? And this commandment have 
we from him, that he that loveth God love his brother 
also. 


*This sermon (actually several sermons combined into one) was first published in Wittenberg by Joseph Klug in 1533 under the title: 
"Etliche schéne Predigten aus der ersten Epistel S. Johannis. Of Love. D. Mart. Luth. 1533." It was preached in 1532, probably during the 


Trinity season. D. Caspar Cruziger copied it and published it with a le 


ter to Gregorius Berndt, Rathsherrn zu Gérlitz, dated May 1, 1533, in 


which he reports that Berndt had heard these sermons himself and had asked Cruziger to share them with others. Therefore, he summarized 





the sermons and had them printed, on the one hand "in order to inci 


e all the more to true Christian love", on the other hand "to shut the 


mouths of those who do not stop crying out against us, as if we teach and hold nothing of love and good works". This sermon was published 
individually by D. Rambach in Halle in 1720 under the title: "Des theuren Mannes Gottes Martini Lutheri erbaulicne Abhandlung von der Liebe 
und ihrer Vortrefflichkeit" ("The noble man of God Martin Luther's edifying treatise on love and its excellence"), and reprinted again in 1725, 
1720 and 1742. In the collective editions: Wittenberger (1556), vol. |, p. 466b; Jenaer (1568), vol. VI, p. 44; Altenburger, vol. VI, p. 45;

In this epistle, the holy apostle St. John exhorts his 
Christians with excellent words to love, that each one 
should have a kind heart toward the other. For the good 
pious man (as no doubt also the other apostles, 
especially St. Paul) has seen with his own eyes that all 
Christians should be kind to one another. Paul) have 
seen with their eyes, and grasped with their hands, and 
experienced how shamefully the devil opposes Christian 
faith and life in the world; and where the dear word 
comes, the devil quickly makes vain doctors out of those 
who have heard it once or twice, who as soon as they 
know the art so well that they even do it to the apostles 
before, and become such proud, joyful spirits, who do 
not yield to anyone, nor suffer a master, not even God 
Himself. And therefore go on with such a raving: | also 
have the spirit, and can do it as well as this my preacher, 
pastor, doctor 2c. If it lusts me, then | will hear it; if not, 
then | may well leave it. Thus, the dear apostles had 
already had great trials, not only from tyrants who 
persecuted Christians by force, sword, fire and water, 
but also from their own brethren who also wanted to be exceedingly wise and learned, and yet, before we look

brought it on, not only in the world everywhere, but also 
in the holy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, 2c., in their 
wn houses. For our Lord Christ, in whom we believe, as 
ell as all the saints from the beginning, is the one man 
o whom the devil belongs. Therefore we must all 
onsider that he attacks us from both sides: first, to 
murder us by his tyrants; then, with lies by false brethren, 
ho make divisions and factions among us; yes, even by 
urselves, when we become sure, and make ourselves 
believe that we can do all things well, and yet prove 
nothing of it anywhere in our lives. 

3. Now it is not so vexatious that tyrants do the one 
ork of the devil, which is called murder and bloodshed, 
ince we know how to judge three things and separate 
urselves from them; But this is first a shameful plague 
nd vexatious business, that we have among us and in 
ur midst those who are called our dear brethren, who 
re friendly and know how to boast of the gospel, are

They were more learned and holier than the apostles 
themselves, and thereby caused division and mobs; as 
he himself complains and confesses when he says I.Ep. 
2, 19: "They came from us, but they were not of us"; that 
is, they came by us, and have heard and learned from 
us what they can, whether they now know themselves to 
be much wiser and more learned than we ourselves. This 
makes it impossible for them to be equal to us and to be 
in harmony with us, but they must do something new and 
special. That is why he continues there, v. 19: "If they 
were of us, they would have remained with us. Item, 
afterwards, v. 5, 6: "They are of the world, therefore the 
world hears them. We are of God, and he who knows 
God hears us. He who is not of God does not hear us" 
2c. This is what the excellent, noble man had to 
experience and see before his eyes and suffer in his own 
diocese, when he worked much and gathered a fine 
people together, that such hopeful spirits became and 
arose from his disciples, who were taught much too 
much for him, and mastered everything and knew better, 
and boasted of a great spirit; but nevertheless lived 
without love at all, and remained full of hatred and envy, 
and created nothing but division and discord. 

Now what should the pious apostle do about it? He 
can do nothing but admonish his flock, as his dear 
children, to beware of such, and learn to know them, and 
let them boast that they are called Christians and have 
the Spirit, 2c. but see how they prove it by their fruits, 
whether they walk according to love. For he who wants 
to boast of the gospel and the spirit, and yet hates and 
despises his brother and neighbor, and does not live as 
love demands, is certainly not of God (he says), for by 
the fruits one can well know the tree, whether it is good 
or evil and harmful. It is indeed a fine teaching to 
recognize that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was sent 
into the flesh to be the Savior of the world (as he says 
shortly before, v. 14), and whoever recognizes this, God 
remains in him, and God in him. But this is the misfortune 
of it, that they can do it so deliciously well, and are so 
exceedingly learned; but when one looks at it, and shall 
need it so, 


and in life, as they know it, no one is at home. But it is 
said: Whoever has the teaching right in his heart, and 
remains in God, also remains in love; for God Himself is 
love. 

Therefore, if you want to be a righteous Christian in 
the sight of God and the world, who does not only carry 
Christ on his tongue, nor read it written on paper or ina 
book, but has it thoroughly in his heart, think that you 
prove it by deed and life before everyone that your love 
serves and helps others. If such a thing is there, and 
such people speak and boast of it, believe that it is true. 
But they don't do it, they don't boast and shout much, but 
this is their common language: "I would like to be a 
Christian, and | hear the gospel and God's word well, but 
unfortunately it doesn't want to go that way, and | feel 
that the two, speaking and doing, word and life, are still 
far apart. | can preach, speak, write, sing and read it, but 
it does not want to enter the heart with such strong, living 
faith and fervent love. Behold, thus these speak of it, 
making not much boasting and rumbling of great art and 
high spirit, but deeming themselves pupils who have 
scarcely begun, and have daily to learn. As St. Paul also 
says of himself Phil. 3, 12. 13.: "| do not let myself think 
that | have already grasped it, but pursue after it, whether 
| may grasp it at last, and reach out for that which is still 
before me" 2c. Item, Rom. 7, 18, he says: "I know and 
want, but | cannot do what is good. As if he wanted to 
say: | would like to believe and live as | should, but | feel 
that it does not want to go away, and the old sack always 
pulls me back, as the dung on the wheel, that | always 
have to fight with myself, and forcefully resist the flesh 
and its conceit. 

(7) Therefore, if the dear high apostles complain of 
such faults and deficiencies that they cannot bring it 
about where they would like to, and may not themselves 
1) boast of it, what kind of unholy people and disgraceful 
spirits must these be, who, once they have looked at a

In short, let love shine and glow as a radiance of faith in 
the heart. Otherwise, let the barrel have beautiful staves, 
bottom and ripeness, but because it sounds and is 
hollow, it has and is of no use. 

(9) Thou mayest adorn thyself with words, and be 
learned; but if it be in earnest, and Christ be right in the 
heart, it shall be proved. Because it is so with God's word 
that the devil sows his seed everywhere, and has so 


understands more than any man can say. 

The apostle St. Paul has also written gloriously about 
it, and praises it with all his might with many words in 1 
Cor. 13 throughout the whole chapter, as he counts its 
goodness and virtue one after the other, v. 4. 5: "Love is 
long-suffering, kind, not jealous, not puffed up, not proud, 
not puffed up, not seeking its own, not provoking itself. 
Item, v. 7: "She bears all things, hopes all things, 
believes all things" 2c. But with all this not so much is 
given, nor so powerfully spoken, as with this single word: 
Love is God Himself, or God is love. So that he may show 
it in the sweetest and kindest way, and stimulate us in 


much to do that the Christians do not take up the matter|the highest and strongest way, that we may strive for it 


righteously, nor with earnestness, but only fills his house 
with empty shells, who only use the name and the words 
as true Christians, and let it float on the tongue alone as 
the foam of beer, it is necessary that one always urges 
and exhorts them to think and be Christians with 
earnestness, and prove it by love, as St. John does here, 
and says: "| am a Christian. John does and says: 

V. 16. God is love, and he who abides in love abides 
in God, and God in him. 

(10) That is to say, truly beginning on a high note, 
praising and exalting love excellently, and strongly 
exhorting and irritating it with the very highest and

and think what a wonderful thing it is when a person 
comes to love God and his neighbor with all his heart. 
For whoever has this, has such good, which is called and 
is God Himself. 

12 If he said, "Love is a great, rich treasure of many 
hundred thousand florins, or a great kingdom, who would 
not esteem it great, and run after it as far as he could run, 
putting his sweat and blood into it, where he hoped or 
knew to obtain it? Yes, if it were even a lesser thing, a 
beautiful house, or a sack full of guilders, how would one 
struggle for it? But what is all this? What is money for all 
the world? 


1682 en. (2.) 18, 312-314. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. w. Ix, 1262-1265. 


1683 





and good, power, might, wisdom, justice? Yes, what is 
the sun and moon, heaven and all creatures, all angels 
and saints in addition? Love is none, but the only, 
eternal, ineffable good and supreme treasure, which is 
called God Himself, from whom everything flows and has 
its essence, yes, exists in and through the same love. In 
addition, whoever remains in love remains in God, and 
God in him, so that he and God become one kitchen 1). 

Now, such words might well move not only the 
papists, but also ourselves, to say that faith not only 
makes righteous, but also love, because it gives it so 
much, that he who abides in love abides in God, and has 
God Himself. But he who has GOD has it all. But he did 
not intend to teach how we can be justified before God 
and come to grace, or how we can take hold of love, so 
that he has loved us through Christ; which cannot be 
done, because 2) it is through faith alone, as he also says 
himself immediately before these words, v.15: "Whoever 
confesses that he has love, he has love. 15: "He who 
confesses that Jesus is the Son of God abides in him, 
and he in God, and we have known and believed the love 
that God has for us. For he would gladly awaken his 
Christians, and heartily exhort and kindle them to burn in 
love toward one another; therefore he exalts and praises 
it as highly as it is to be praised. 

For what shall one say much about it? If one says for 
a long time that it is a high, noble quality in the soul, and 
the most exquisite and perfect virtue, as the philosophers 
and teachers of works speak of it, that is still nothing 
compared to this, that he pours out with his mouth full, 
and says: God Himself is love, and His nature is pure 
love. That if someone wanted to paint and meet God, he 
would have to meet such an image, which would be pure 
love, as if the divine nature were nothing but a furnace 
and fervor of such love, which fills heaven and earth. And 
again, if one could paint and form love, one would have 
to make such a picture that is not 


1) Wittenberger: Church. 
2) Erlanger: ohn. 





work nor human, indeed, not angelic nor heavenly, but 
God Himself. 

(15) Behold, thus the apostle can paint it here, that 
he makes of God and love one thing, that by such a 
noble, delicious and lovely image he may all the more 
attract and draw us to himself, that we may also strive to 
have love among ourselves, and beware of envy, hatred 
and discord. For as love is an image of God, and not a 
dead image, nor painted on paper, but a living being in 
divine nature, burning with all goodness, so again hatred 
and envy are a true image of the devil; yes, not human 
nor devilish, but the devil himself, as he is nothing in his 
nature, but an eternal fire of hatred and envy against God 
and all his works, both men and all creatures, that one 
could not paint the devil better, than if one could paint 
vain hatred and envy. 

16 This can be seen in what follows from the two, 
namely, from hatred and envy, all the misfortune, 
murder, sorrow and plague in the world, brought about 
by him; but from love, all happiness, peace, salvation, 
help, comfort, counsel, and the best that God himself has 
and gives. For love does and practices the very same 
works that God himself does. But what does God do? 
First, He gives life to the whole world, to each one his 
body and all his limbs, health, light, air, water, fire, food, 
drink, and all necessities, so that heaven and earth must 
serve each one. Now what is all this but vain heat and a 
fiery oven full of love? And God proves the same wicked 
men and wretches, who blaspheme and persecute his 
word, crucify his Son for this purpose, and do him all 
harm and vexation without ceasing; nor does he lavish 
on them all goods and gifts. What should he do to such, 
if he were not vain love, and would deal with us as we 
deserve? Should he not always strike down with thunder, 
lightning and hellish fire? 

17) The devil, on the other hand, is a vain adversary 
of love, causing nothing but strife, murder and 
heartache, and all plagues in the world, and especially 
against the pious, so that if God did not control him 
mightily 3) he would throw himself on the earth. 


3) Wittenberg and Jena: tremendous. 


1684 en. (2.) 18, 314-316. sermon on 1 John 4, 16-21. 


The whole world at once in a heap, because he is God's 
enemy and has not a speck of love in him. His children 
also follow him, the great multitude of the world, where 
there is also no divine love, but only robbery and stealing, 
and contempt for the neighbor; just as in the Gospel Luc. 
16, 20. 21. is illustrated by the rich man who despised 
poor Lazarum and left him lying at his door, so devoid of 
all love and mercy that he did not even allow him the 
small pieces of bread that fell under his table and did not 
eat the dogs themselves; indeed, he did not like to see 
them lying at his door, yet he wanted to be called a pious 
man. But if he had had a little love in his heart, he would 
have known the commandment of Moses, who said, 
Exodus 23:4, 5: "If thou seest thy neighbor's ox or ass go 
astray, thou shalt bring it to him again"; or, if thou seest 
him lying under the burden, thou shalt not leave him 
lying, but shalt help him up again. From this his own heart 
could have finely concluded: Since God gives that | 
should also help up my enemy's donkey, how much more 
should | help him myself when | see him suffering 
hardship and adversity 2c. But what does he do? There 
lies not his enemy's, nor a poor man's ox or ass, but he 
himself, the poor, innocent, wretched man, sick and full 
of sores, desiring nothing but to be satisfied with the 
crumbs that are thrown to the dogs: and he passes over 
before him daily, and gives him not a drop of water. 

Behold, is this not the fruit of the devil, even the devil 
himself in the flesh? For this is his way, where God does 
vain good deeds and works of love, he on the other hand 
does vain works of hate, and rejoices in this, if only he 
causes all misfortune. So does this one, too; nor does he 
go there safely, making no conscience of him that, as 
much as there is in him, he strangles his neighbor, but 
despises him as a damned man whom neither God nor 
the world regards; thinks there is nothing good nor pure 
in him, so leaves him, and becomes a devil's child in him, 
since he would like to become a god in him. 


1) "one" is missing in the Erlanger. 





1685 


W. ix, 1265-1267. 


19. This means (I say) that God, if one wants to see 
him in his works, even those that he does physically and 
temporally, is nothing other than vain inexpressible love, 
greater and more than anyone can ever conceive; 
Indeed, which is the most shameful thing, the world also 
does not respect, nor does it give thanks for it, although 
it sees so many innumerable benefits of God before its 
eyes every hour, that it earns honestly with its ingratitude 
every day, that God would not let the sun shine on it for 
a moment, nor let a straw grow out of the earth, nor grant 
it life. Therefore, he does not cease to love and do good 
without ceasing, even outwardly and in the flesh. | will 
keep silent about what he does when it comes to spiritual 
goods: He pours out, not sun and moon, nor heaven and 
earth, but his own heart and his dearest Son, so that he 
also lets him shed his blood and die the most shameful 
death, for us shameful, wicked, ungrateful people. 2) He 
also lets him die the most shameful death, for us 
shameful, evil, ungrateful people. How can one say 
otherwise here than that God is nothing but an abyss of 
eternal love; and again, love nothing but vain God? 
Therefore, he who has love must also have vain God, 
and be full of Him. 

(20) Whether he intervenes at times to punish and 
afflict the world, he must do so, and cannot do otherwise. 
For if he should never punish us, we would soon choke 
and devour one another, and in the end his kingdom and 
all his good deeds would be disturbed and dampened. 
He cannot control our wickedness in this way, even 
though we see and feel all the plagues before us; what 
would it be like if he did not punish at all, and freely 
allowed all goodwill? But nevertheless he remains love, 
as his nature is love, so that even if he has to thunder, 
flash and punish, it is only out of love and a good heart. 
For he does it only to ward off the wicked, and must 
thereby frighten a little the stubborn, stubborn heads that 
rob, steal, sting, and live in all kinds of blasphemous 
behavior, for the sake of his own, who are oppressed and 
afflicted, and must suffer all the will of the world and the 
devil, that they may also be saved. 


2) Erlanger: so also, -that he lets him 2c.

They are strengthened and refreshed, and see that they 
have a God who means them with faithfulness and can 
ride against everyone's wrath and rage; so that against 
us, who believe in him, even his wrathful works must be 
called love. For all this is done for our comfort and 
salvation against our enemies, who have neither love 
nor mercy, nor are willing to suffer. 

(21) Just as one must say of a pious prince and lord: 
The prince is vain love and mercy toward everyone who 
comes before him; nevertheless, he must have sword, 
spear, halberds and _ rifles, executioners and 
executioners around him, so that he reaches out and 
throws down among those who strive against his 
kingdom and peaceful regiment, or harm his own. But in 
his hall and castle there is nothing but pure grace and 
love; and yet he must also do this by heart to protect his 
regiment and subjects, and he does this out of pure love. 
So also with God there is neither wrath nor disfavor, and 
his heart and thoughts nothing but pure love, as can be 
seen everywhere in all the works in heaven and earth; 
that he also proves his love for us by throwing in three 
things at times, as he must do for my sake and yours, so 
that we can comfort ourselves that the world's fierce 
wrath and furious, devilish hatred does not have to 
devour us or destroy us, but will not let anyone go out 
who acts against love; He will take care of the pious as 
warmly and faithfully as he did for Abel against Cain, but 
will let the wicked go and be punished because they do 
not want love. 

(22) This he himself has depicted in nature and in his 
works. For even the natural masters, who have 
experienced and described the nature of animals, say of 
the bees that the king among them has no sting at all, 
yet all the others in the hive strike and sting and leave 
their lives over it; but he alone is without wrath: and 
although he neither harms nor can harm anyone for 
himself, he must still have those around him who can 
sting and keep him safe; for if he were to just go along, 
the foreign bees or bumblebees would kill him. 
According to this image, there is no anger in God's 
nature and essence, and nothing but vanity. 


Love and goodness; but that he lets all kinds of plagues 
go, hail, thunder, flood, water, evil, monstrous beasts, 
hunger, war, pestilence, pestilence, and the devil from 
hell, he needs as a sting around him, so that he remains 
with his majesty, and protects and comforts his own; 
Otherwise, the devil would be too powerful, and grab his 
honor and crown, and dampen his kingdom, so that no 
one would know what God was and was able to do, and 
Christ with his gospel and Christians would even be 
suppressed in the world. 

(23) Thus you see what it says: "God is love"; that 
everyone must see it and grasp it, if only he opens his 
eyes. For all his goods are before your eyes every day, 
wherever you look: the sun and the moon, and the whole 
sky full of light; the earth full of leaves, grass, grain and 
all kinds of plants, prepared and given to you for food. 
Item, father and mother, house, yard, peace, protection 
and security, by worldly authority regiment 2c. And 
above all, that he gives his dear Son for thee, and brings 
thee home through the gospel, to help thee out of all 
distress and trouble. What more could he do for you, or 
what more and better could you desire? This, | think, is 
a fire and fervor, that no one can reach such great love 
with thoughts. And whoever does not see or respect 
such things must either be blind as a bat or stone-hard 
and dead. 

Since you (St. John will say), as Christians who want 
to be and know God, see this and know that God 1) is 
nothing but love poured out on us in the most abundant 
way, let this go to your hearts, so that you also do the 
same toward your neighbor. For it is not possible for 
anyone who feels such a fire of love that he should not 
also be warmed and ignited a little by it. And if you do 
this (he says), you have such comfort and benefit from it 
that you remain in God, and God in you. This is beyond 
all measure a great treasure and a glorious glory, to be 
certain that God is and dwells in and with us, yes, that 
we are in Him and with Him One Cake, as we will soon 
hear further.

25 But he does not add these words in vain: "He who 
abides in love" 2c. For he has seen that this is a very 
strange virtue, and that we all soon become lazy and 
slothful, and there are many who accept the gospel, and 
attack it with great, brave earnestness, and also become 
joyful, and thank God for the grace, that they have been 
delivered from error and blindness, and are now to be 
regarded as the finest Christians, so that it is thought that 
they have eaten the gospel, and are so full of it that they 
pass over, making believe that they now love God and 
the world; But they are a fickle people, as Christ said of 
the seed that falls on the stony ground, which soon 
sprouts and grows as if it were to become something 
delicious, but as soon as the sun comes over it withers 
and dies. Luc. 8, 6. 

(26) So these also looked well, but it lasted, as they 
say, one dance to the high mass. Just as it was with our 
Gospel, when all the world ran to the first, and it was a 
delicious doctrine, and it was to be hoped that everyone 
would become Christians. For it is a fine sermon, and is 
well received, that Christ is the only Savior, through 
whom we are redeemed and set free from all sins and 
evils, and in him we receive everything that is necessary 
for our salvation. This sounds well, and is comforting and 
sweet to hear; everyone wants to stick to it, and now 
everyone can talk and boast about it, preach and write 
all over the world; but nothing more comes of it. And that 
it was wrong is because they do not stay with it, but as 
soon as they want to change the weather, they want to 
prevent that they should leave their advantage, 1) that 
they must stand in danger of their food, honor, body and 
life, or Someone says and does something to them that 
they do not like, then they become angry or lazy. The 
others, as obstinate, stubborn heads, fall away and 
cause trouble, separating the pure doctrine and the 
Christian church. Then it is all over, and neither love, nor 
faith, nor Christ remains, but only shells and deaf nuts, 
which keep the name of Christians, but lose the kernel 
and the core. 


1) Erlanger: "that they should not leave their advantage". - The 
following words: "that they... Le-ens" are missing in the Erlanger. 





They husk themselves, and weave together like the chaff 
of the pure grain, one here, the other out there; one has 
this to do, the other another, that he may arrange his 
own. And so they go about among themselves, as we 
now see, all boasting of the gospel. But what is the last 
of these? They do not remain in love, therefore they do 
not remain in God. This is: It is a false faith, and no 
reason nor root in the heart, but only grasped with the 
ears, and hovering on the tongue, and keeping the letters 
of it, as it is written. 

27 You must not look far for examples of this. For how 
many of them are there now, even of the best people who 
praise the gospel, who for its sake would willingly lose a 
penny, or give up their stinginess and their courage? 
There is no farmer or citizen who, for the sake of the 
gospel, would give his grain at the market for a penny 
more, even if it is well spent, but if he could make it a 
guilder more expensive, he would do it much better; and 
a citizen, if he could sell his grain for beer, even if one 
would have to drink death on it, he would not make a 
conscience of it. Similarly, with all kinds of trade and 
crafts, since everyone is busy translating people, and 
only scrounges, stingy and harmed, God grant that the 
gospel and conscience remain where it can. And no one 
complies with them, no matter how highly they are 
admonished, but they act as if they wanted to defy us 
and the gospel. Just as among the nobility, Junker 
Scharrhan not only drives his will to courage with pride 
and defiance, but also tramples on the poor preachers 
and acts in the most disgraceful manner. 

028 Behold, so they abide in love, that for the sake of 
a penny and their belly they despise the gospel, God, 
and their neighbor, and become much worse than the 
heathen. But if you want to be a Christian, you must 
remain in love in another way, so that you do to your 
neighbor what you would have done to yourself. And 
even if you have to suffer injustice and sorrow over it, so 
that you can leave everything behind beforehand, so that 
you can have only your Christ and this divine love.

silent about what people show each other in secret 
deceit, and yet under a beautiful appearance. Item, what 
happens about it, if one comes into spiritual things, 
where each one lets himself think the most learned and 
cleverest, and his conceit must be the best, there is no 
preacher, whom he does not know to reprove and 
despise; and none is among them, if he should agree 
and hold with us, make nothing different or better, who 
would not let himself think it would be a great shame for 
him. This means that all of them did not remain in love, 
but acted unpeacefully 1) and only preached for the 
sake of his belly or honor and fame, and caused sects. 
This is what St. John means in the front of this epistle 
(as | said), when he says Cap. 2, 19: "They went out 
from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of 
us, they would have remained with us." As there are still 
many among us who hear and teach the gospel with us, 
need the same sacraments, and present themselves as 
true Christians; but they are among us as chaff among 
the grain; when it comes to the meeting, one sees who 
they are and where they belong. For there is nothing but 
pride, conceit, envy, contempt and the devil himself. 

29 This means that St. John says in this epistle about 
"abiding": "He who abides in love abides in God. "And 
again, he who does not abide in love does not abide in 
God, nor God in him; he separates and sheds himself 
as a useless, unfit husk or chaff, so that it must be seen 
that he is not of the right grain. For it is not such a great 
art to begin a Christian life and love; but it is an art and 
an effort to remain in it and to persevere, especially 
when 2) temptation and resistance come along. 
Although there are still many coarse, crude people who 
fall away from themselves as rotten, worm-eaten apples 
or pears, and are drowned in their avarice, pride, envy 
2c. These are unadvised, unworthy fruits, and

no use at all, as they neither should nor can stay. 

(30) But we are talking about those whom the wind 
and the weather knocks off, that is, those who allow 
themselves to be overthrown by such temptations and 
thoughts: Why should | stay with the teaching? | can see 
that one does not get anything out of it, because one 
must incur all the world's disfavor, contempt, enmity, 
raging and fury, life and limb, and always stand at the 
head against the devil, the world and the flesh 2c. Who 
can come to this or stay with it, if he is to have nothing 
more of it? Then it is sore under my eyes, when | am 
supposed to be favorable to him, to do good and to wish 
for him, who puts all heartache on me, and does not 
grant me life; then it is hard to hold on, and not to be 
angered nor wearied, so that one does not 3) desist from 
good works. For it is so strange even for a Christian to 
want to grow weary and overcome impatience. 

(31) But it shall not be so, but it is said, torn through 
and continued unhindered, it meets us sweet or sour, 
and goes over us, as it pleases, it is friend or foe, even 
if it were the devil himself, and always thought: | have 
not therefore begun anything that men should give me, 
or love and reward me; therefore | have not left it, though 
| get ingratitude, envy and hatred for it. As a Christian, | 
have helped everyone and done my best with all my 
strength, and | still want to help and serve them where | 
can (but so far that | suffer their mischievousness and 
malice, but do not approve of it). If they pay me badly, 
then | have put it there first, because | know that the 
world should not pay me, nor can it. But it shall not be 
so wicked as to overdo me, 4) but rather, contrary to it, | 
will continue to do good, not to you nor to anyone else, 
but for the sake of my Lord Christ, because he has 
continued, and has not allowed himself to be hindered, 
neither by the wicked world nor by the devil; and so | will 
freely strike my good deed into the air, and | will do it for 
the sake of my Lord. 


3) "not" is missing in the Erlanger.

willingly lose, as he has also done and still does. 

32 For this reason St. John also says, "He who wants 
to serve and do good to the world must not think that he 
will earn gratitude or honor and good by doing so. For he 
that doeth it, and seeketh to be thanked, hath already lost 
and corrupted his good works, and shall not long abide in 
love. Now the whole world is so skilful that it neither wants 
nor can suffer ingratitude and contempt for its good 
deeds, but as soon as one is angered in one piece, or 
does not give as much thanks as he wants, the world is 
inflamed and raises such cries and ravings: | have done 
him so much good, and would gladly have shared his 
heart in the body; behold! how he pays me, that is the 
thanks thereof 2c. This means a pagan good deed (which 
whores and boys can also do), serving one, that one must 
thank thee for it, and celebrate thee as a god, and be as 
it were thy prisoner. For no heathen is so great when he 
does you good, and you do not thank him, that he is not 
angry and removes his hand. Yes, a cow would be angry, 
if it should give milk for a long time, and one did not want 
to give it grass. 

33. But with the Christians it is not called to go back 
and to withdraw the hand, but to continue and to remain 
in love, that it is a divine, free, unceasing, yes, also a lost 
love with the people, and thus the benefit poured out, so 
that he does not speak like the world: | have given you so 
much and done so much, and you pay me like a rogue 
and a villain, so | will not give you a penny from now on, 
nor help you, if | could save you from death with a finger; 
but turn the page and say: | have served you, and done 
good according to my ability, and you pay it badly, that | 
deserve nothing for my kind heart and good deed but vain 
ingratitude. Well, therefore let it alone; you shall not be so 
wicked and ungrateful, my love shall be far too good for 
your wickedness; so far, nevertheless, as to punish what 
is to be punished, but therefore not to close hand and 
heart to him where he has need of love. 

34 So you see what this is, abiding in love, both rude 
among men, but 


1693 


W. IX, 1275-1278. 


Much more in the spiritual essence, where St. John 
urges the most, namely in teaching and Christianity, 
where one should bear and tolerate the other, help and 
advise, even if he is ungrateful and does evil for good. 
But such things do not enter into the human heart. For 
such love is not a natural art, nor grown in our garden, 
but a gift of the Holy Spirit, that a man may give love for 
sorrow, and for all wickedness and malice do all good, 
and not cease. Therefore he says: "He who abides in 
love abides in God," 2c., that is, where love is, there is 
and dwells God, and is not natural nor human, much 
less diabolical, but heavenly and divine. For God alone 
is the man who does not cease to do vain good to the 
world against the world's ingratitude and contempt, but 
devours and consumes all iniquity and wickedness by 
the fire of his love. A Christian should also have such a 
heart that he does not let himself be pressed by favor 
and friendship, and does not make himself so angry and 
bitter that his heart does not remain sweet through such 
divine love. 

35 And so that we can do this the more easily, he 
gives us great comfort, saying: If you remain in love in 
this way, be confident and of good cheer, certain that 
you have a divine life, yes, God Himself is in and with 
you, so that you remain in God, and God in you. Not so 
that one thereby obtains a gracious God, for that must 
first exist through faith, since no one has nor is able to 
have such divine love (as | have said), for whoever has 
been justified by faith through Christ, and has received 
forgiveness of sins, and recognizes the love of God and 
feels it in his heart, must be inflamed by it, so that he 
also again feels loyal love towards God and his 
neighbor. For God has never loved anyone before (says 
St. John himself in this epistle, before and after), but he 
first 1) loved us and sent his Son to make atonement for 
our sin, and thereby made us his children. Now when 
one has taken hold of such love through faith, this fruit 
follows that we also show such love, and

have a sure sign and testimony, because we abide in 
love, that we find true Christians, and abide in God, and 
He abides in us. 

How could he comfort more, or praise love more 
highly, than that it makes a divine man, who is one cake 
with him, and can boast when he loves his neighbor, and 
credits him with his ingratitude and displeasing works, 
whether he disgraces and afflicts him for his good deeds, 
that he has done as a god? Not as if he had founded the 
great church at Rome or Cologne, but as if he had done 
something more and greater than heaven and earth, 
namely such a work, which is called a divine work, and 
the best that the high majesty itself has done. Now none 
of us, if he had endowed a church or a hospital, would 
have his heart swell and blow out, and everyone would 
think: O, this is an exquisite work, which not everyone can 
do; God must look at it specially and reward it 2c. But 
what would it be against this that he says here, "He who 
abides in love abides in God," and vainly does such 
works as God Himself does? is no longer a mere man, 
but a God, and better than sun and moon, heaven and 
earth, and what is before the eyes. For God himself is in 
him, and does such a thing that no man nor creature can 
do. For any man that hath money and goods can build 
churches, and do such works as seem great and glorious; 
but to keep such love and sweet patience of heart toward 
all men, that is not man's art, neither is it man's ability. 

(37) But no one believes and respects this; therefore 
we go along like good fellows, may anger God and the 
world for the sake of a word, and cause misery, do not 
want to suffer anything from anyone, and thereby lose 
such excellent comfort and glorious glory and defiance, 
which a Christian has from such love, and make us give 
a heavy account, that we so surely throw such things to 
the wind, and do not respect what we owe to God, and 
thank Him so badly for His love and good deeds. For if 
you remain steadfast in love, and count against one 
another what you do to your neighbor, and how God has 
done to you, you will find that according to the Gospel you 
are guilty of hun 





1695 


Thousand cents, since your neighbor owes barely a 
hundred pennies. Then a laudable reckoning will be 
made, and you will 1) very well pass that you let love fall 
for the sake of a penny, yes, for the sake of a word, pour 
out your wrath, and untie both sackcloth and rope: And 
he up in heaven shall give thee all good things, deliver 
thee from death and the devil, preserve and keep thy life 
and limb, make as many angels wait upon thee, let the 
sun and the moon, the earth and all creatures serve thee 
without ceasing, that thou mayest but freely go and do 
that which pleaseth him nothing in all places, and 
mayest not even thank him in the whole year. Wouldn't 
he have a good right and reason enough to lead you 
along with him as you do to your neighbor and deprive 
you of all his good deeds? because he can raise a 
hundred thousand against you, since you don't have one 
against your neighbor. 

(38) But no one thinks about it; from that moment on 
everything is forgotten and despised, which he daily 
shows us for gratuitous good deeds, and for which he 
must suffer vain ingratitude. But if we feel a little 
ingratitude, the whole world shall burn, and God Himself 
shall strike it with thunder and lightning. But how does 
Christ and God remain in you, and you in Him? He 
remains up in heaven, but you on earth, yes, with the 
devil from hell. But if you want God to remain in you with 
his love, and if you want to be one thing with him, and 
be called a divine man, then you must also remain in 
love, patience and good deeds toward your neighbor, for 
the two are stuck and grafted into each other. If you are 
such a divine, heavenly man, and do not let other 
people's ingratitude or malice take away your sweet 
heart, he will not let his love and fatherly heart be taken 
away from you either, but will smile on you sweetly and 
kindly and do all good, a hundred thousand times more 
than you can do to your neighbor, and give you ten 
thousand pounds where you give your debtor ten 
pennies, and stay with you, and put to you all that he has 
and is able. 

(39) Behold, St. John would gladly awaken us with 
great, excellent, powerful, and powerful things.

1696 Eni. (2.) 18, 327-329. sermon on | John 4, 16-21. 


w. IX, 1280-1283. 1697 





We are to live among ourselves in Christian unity and 
love, and to remain constant in this, so that we do not 
allow ourselves to be dissuaded from this, even if we are 
not shown love and gratitude for it again; but rather, we 
are to live friendly with one another among Christians, 
also to let love go unhindered toward others, and in 
short, not to let any thing be so evil as to deter us from 
this, but rather to continue and speak against it: My dear 
brother, what | have done to you, or am still doing, | have 
done out of true love, and have never desired that you 
should thank or reward me for it. If you thank me, God 
thanks you again; if not, it is just as much to me, for | did 
not do it for that reason, but what | do, | do for the sake 
of him who loved me so much that he died on the cross 
for me, an ungrateful and condemned man, and still 
does more good every moment than | am worth, or can 
thank him for. 

(40) Now if we 1) let ourselves take such things to 
heart, and were so minded, then unity would remain in 
Christendom, and God would be with us with all good, 
and would live in such a way that He would have 
pleasure and joy from it with all the angels. But it is the 
wretched devil that we always hear it sounded and 
preached, and yet do not want to heed such excellent 
admonition and glorious consolation, and all remain in 
such a way that we love and do good only for the sake 
of thanksgiving, friendship and enjoyment, like the 
heathen and the wicked. And where this turns, all love 
and friendship ceases, and goes everywhere in the 
world, as they say: "If you were to carry someone on 
your back all the way to Rome, and once set him down 
unsteadily, the whole way would be lost. 

(41) But | have said that this does not mean that one 
should approve ingratitude or injustice and not punish 
evil, or that one should give and do good to those who 
are not allowed to do so, or that one should not want to 
have or suffer our love and friendship. For that is not 
called loving either, if one wanted to pretend with them, 
to keep their friendship and let them remain in their 
wickedness. For for this one should not have any special 


1) "us" is missing in the Erlanger. 





Virtue nor patience, which Christians must have, so that 
they can say: This is not done right, and pleases me 
nothing, and is fair to punish; but nevertheless | will not 
let myself overcome it, nor let love stand, whether it hurts 
and is annoying. For thou shalt not make it so poisonous 
and wicked, yet my heart shall remain sweet and kind; if 
| can amend thee, well, if not, depart; yet | will remain 
pious, and for thy sake will not forsake my godly love, 
nor follow thy devilish grudge and hatred. But if thou art 
so wicked that thou wilt not keep my good deed, nor 
suffer it, | must let it be done. For who can give someone 
without his thanks? For even though God gives all good 
things to all the world without ceasing, and adds Christ 
to it, he cannot give it to those who do not want it; but 
because they reject it, he must lose his good deeds to 
them and let them go. 2c. 


(42) So then he has praised love above all things that 
may be called on earth. For he makes such a thing called 
God himself, and he who has it praises it not as a man, 
nor as a prince, king or emperor, but as a God. And 
setteth him not in a bad place, yea, not above lords and 
princes, neither bad in paradise, but above all creatures, 
in GOD himself, that he and GOD are undivided. What 
is more delicious and glorious to wish for or to think of, 
than to be one thing with God, and to remain there, 
where the high majesty is? What are all houses of 
worship and monks against such a man? For none of 
them will ever increase in glory and price with his and all 
the world's holiness, so that he can say: He who remains 
a Carthusian or a monk remains in God, and God in him. 
For they have neither the Word of God nor the testimony 
of the Scriptures concerning their things, as every 
Christian has and can happily boast of, if only he will 
follow them. St. John now explains further in beautiful 
words what it is that God abides in us, and we in Him, 
and how love must be complete, unfeigned, and 
righteous, where there is to be such confidence and 
defiance that God is with us, and we with Him, and 
speaks thus: 


1698 en. (s) 18, 389-338. Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. w.ix, 1283-1285. 


In this love is fully with us, that we may 
have joy in the day of judgment. 

(43) This also is a strong stimulus to love, and a great 
benefit, that through it we may have joy in the day of 
judgment. But he always speaks, as | have said, against 
the false brethren and hypocritical Christians, who have 
the gospel only in their mouths and on their tongues, and 
keep the foam of it, so that they make themselves 
believe that the gospel and faith are in words alone, so 
that much can be washed from them; and when they 
have heard it once, they alone are masters of the art, 
and no one can do it so well as they; they know how to 
judge all others, and to reprove all the world, and no one 
is So evangelical as they. But that it is a true help is seen 
by the fact that they do not think to live by it and to prove 
love, so that one could see that they are serious; they 
have not needed more of it than that they have heard 
that one can get forgiveness of sins and become blessed 
by faith alone, and cannot attain this by works. Therefore 
they become lazy and do not want to do any works; they 
always go under the name of faith and become worse 
than before, and live in such a way that even the world 
must punish them, let alone that they should stand 
before God. 

(44) To this the apostle says, No, it will not do, though 
it is true that by faith we have and obtain all things; but 
unless we also make faith appear through love, it will 
certainly be nothing, but a mere false dream of faith, that 
thou mayest deceive thyself. Therefore, look at your 
fruits; and if they are not righteous, do not be comforted 
by your false delusion of faith and grace. 

(45) Therefore he warns that we should not think that 
the gospel and faith are only in the words and thoughts 
we have of it, but that there must be such a thing planted 
in the heart, breaking out there, and making itself known 
through love, and such love as is whole and righteous 
against friend and foe. For this means (he says) a 
complete, that is, a fine round love, which has no 
deficiency, which makes it have a joyfulness, and can 
withstand 


1699 


on the day of judgment. So with these words he leads us 
to judgment, so that it may be seen that it is serious and 
not to be taken in stride, as if there were not much in it 
and it were not so strict and harshly commanded. But he 
means, in my understanding, the last judgment of God, 
although it may be understood, as some also interpret it, 
of the judgment or sentence by which Christians are 
martyred or condemned, which is also not far from it. For 
it comes to this, that the conscience must answer as 
before God, that he who stands there also stands at the 
last judgment. 

46. be it therefore the judgment, which or when it will, 
he wills that faith shall prove itself so, that, when it 
cometh to pass, when thou shalt take thy head, or the 
stretching of the legs, or the last day, thou mayest have 
a defiance, and be able to stand. For surely there shall 
be no lying nor deceiving, but there shall be one who 
shall approve thee, and put thy faith to the test, and try 
whether it be righteous. Then the empty, hollow faith will 
count for nothing, for it will be found that it has done 
nothing, nor shown love, but has been envious, hateful, 
stingy, proud, and only led the name of it; all this will have 
to come out, and cannot be hidden, especially when one 
meets the great proud spirits, who pretend to great, 
excellent holiness, and reform all the world, and do 
something special, so that everyone should say that they 
alone are true Christians; This lasts for a while, can be 
colored and adorned, but when the hour comes, all such 
talk falls away, and it becomes clear whether you have 
believed righteously and done the work of a righteous 
believer. 

(47) Therefore see to it that you do not have the 
loose, empty shells of love floating on your tongue, for 
that is a cold, lazy, unfit love; but that it is a whole, 
complete love, which is the core and the marrow, so that 
it can make a joyful heart when death comes and the last 
judgment, so that you may not be afraid nor tremble, but 
may rejoice in the presence of the Lord.

W. IX, 1285-1288. 





To God and to all the world | say: | have lived in such a 
way, praise God, that my neighbor cannot complain 
about me; | have not stolen, hated, robbed or 
blasphemed anyone, but have done good to everyone 
as much as | can. But if it sounds like this: | have boasted 
of the gospel, and done no good to my neighbor; | have 
been stingy and cunning, proud and disobedient, hateful 
and envious, so that your own heart must say: Woe is 
me, what a Christian | have been, how have | proved my 
faith! then you will be so afraid that both gospel and faith 
will be lost to you (if God does not specially direct and 
sustain you). For the devil will soon be behind you and 
read your register and say: What can you boast about 
faith and Christ? 

48 Therefore he calls "perfect love" such a love, 
which is righteous as it should be, and walks as it should 
walk; not with mere words and boasts, like the empty 
shells or numb nuts, but like a full nut, since it is found in 
fact to be righteous, so that no one can reprove it on 
earth. (For to be perfect and blameless against God is 
another thing, as we shall hear). Such is the case when 
your heart does not punish you, but can take courage 
and remain fearless against the terror of conscience, 
death and devils, and thus say: "I have, in praise of God, 
confessed my Lord Christ before the world and against 
the devil, and have lived in such a way toward my 
neighbor that no one can complain about me, no one 
has harmed anyone, and everyone has gladly forgiven 
me and done good; then | know that he will forgive me 
again and do good, as he has also promised. Just as 
Moses himself praised God against his rebellious mob, 
Deut. 16:15: "Lord, you know that | have never desired 
a sheep that was theirs. Item, the prophet Samuel also 
defies his people 1 Sam. 12, 3: "If anyone can accuse 
me or convince me that | have taken something from 
him, or that | have wronged someone, let him stand up 
and accuse me freely 2c. David also boasts in the 
Psalter, Ps. 18, 25: "The Lord repays me according to 
my righteousness, and according to the pure. 





| have done the work of my hands before his eyes. As if 
to say, "I know that | have governed my people and 
conducted my estate in such a way that | have not 
wronged or harmed anyone. For this is to keep one's 
hands clean, to deal righteously with everyone in public, 
so that no one can complain about it. 

49 Every Christian must also have such glory, if he is 
to prove his faith otherwise than by righteous fruits, that 
he may plead before God and everyone that he has 
acted faithfully and rightly in his life or ministry, not taught 
unrighteously as a preacher, nor deceived or offended 
anyone as any other Christian, kept his marriage right, 
raised his children and his household well, harmed no 
neighbor, or even reconciled him and done him enough 
2c, so that no one can accuse him from now on, and so 
find in himself such piety and purity (as David calls it), so 
that he can stand before all the world, and also maintain 
such defiance before God's judgment. For if a man 
should die as a Christian, who has never lived as a 
Christian, what will he have for defiance and glory, when 
both the world complains about him, and his own 
conscience testifies against him? And it will be very 
difficult for him to stand his ground. He should not 
despair, but there is an art to it, that he takes hold of 
Christ in the last hour, when he has neither experience 
nor signs of faith, and suddenly lifts himself up so high 
that he begins to believe in the very last moment of need. 

50 But thou sayest, This is contrary to thine own 
doctrine. For thus we taught before, that by works we 
cannot stand, nor have and retain glory in the sight of 
God; how then is it said here: That through love we have 
joy in the sight of God? This is straightforwardly against 
faith 2c. Answer: Yes, that is true, and hold only such 
things firmly and surely. For | have taught and 
admonished diligently hitherto, and still, that the two 
should only be well and purely separated, faith and love, 
and that each should be taught and practiced rightly. For 
otherwise we are blamed, because we make such a big 
deal of the doctrine of faith that we neither preach nor 
practice good works, even though we are in the presence 
of the Lord.

1703 





All the world can testify that | have preached much more 
gloriously and powerfully about good works than they 
themselves who blaspheme us. But this we punish, 
because they do not distinguish between works and 
faith, but brew and mix them together, so that it is not 
known what faith or works do and give; indeed, before 
our teaching, they knew nothing at all about faith, and 
gave everything to works that Christ is to give through 
faith. But we urge that one have and keep a right 
instruction and certain understanding of both, how far 
faith and love or works go. 

For the world does not want to go the right way, but 
always the wrong way; either it does nothing and does 
not work, or it does not believe; it always goes to the 
side, so that it lets either faith or love go; it will not and 
cannot take the middle road, so that it practices both, 
faith toward God pure and unharmed, and love toward 
the neighbor with a righteous heart. Just as St. John 
demands and drives both; although in this epistle he 
primarily intends to exhort to love, he also does not 
forget faith, and is always adamant about it. For this is 
also how it stands shortly before this text, when he says, 
v. 9: "How God has loved us through His only begotten 
Son, sent into the world that we might live through Him"; 
and concludes with these words, v. 15: "Whoever then 
confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, in him abides 
God, and he in God" 2c. There he gives it to faith, and 
yet here he puts the same words of love: "He who abides 
in love abides in God, and he in him." How does this 
rhyme together? Is it then both true that through faith we 
abide in GOD, and He in us, and also through love? Yes, 
both are true, but they are so far apart that you must 
distinguish and discuss them properly. For where they 
are to be thrown together, they cannot stand together. 

52. but this is the difference, as | have always taught 
from the Scriptures, when it comes to the chief joy by 
which | am to stand before God against my sin: if he will 
keep account with me, then my life, work and love will 
never be perfect nor sufficient, but | must find another 
man. 





who is called Christ, sent by the Father, as St. John said 
before, to make atonement for our sin. This is what | call 
the chief joy, or the chief glory and highest defiance, 
which alone must do and keep it when God's judgment 
comes, and stand against his wrath, by which all my life 
and deeds must be condemned to hell. Thus he himself 
called it above, Cap. 2, 28, where he tells us to remain 
with Christ, "so that when he is revealed, we may have 
joy and not be ashamed before him in his coming. This 
is also what he means by the preceding words, v. 15: 
"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, in him 
abides God, and he in God" 2c. . 

(53) But above this we must also have a glory, not 
only against God, but also before God and before 
Christianity, against all the world, so that no one can 
condemn us, nor accuse us with truth, as St. Paul Apost. 
24, 15. 16. before the governor against his accusers, and 
says: "After | have believed, and have hope in God that 
the resurrection of the dead will be in the future, | strive 
to have an unharmed conscience in all things, both 
toward God and toward man," 2c., that is, to live in such 
a way that no one can offend or be angry with me. Item, 
2 Cor. 1-, 12: "Our glory is this, that is, the testimony of 
our conscience, that we have walked in simplicity and 
godly integrity in the world," that is, that no one can 
accuse us of having gone about with hypocrisy or wicked 
deceit. Defy the false apostles and everyone, if they can 
accuse him of preaching unrighteously or of doing wrong 
with the gospel, just as Moses and Samuel defied their 
Jews, if anyone could come forward whom they had 
harmed. For a devout preacher should take with him the 
glory that he has preached the gospel rightly and 
faithfully, and should plead this against the devil and all 
the world, as St. Paul also writes elsewhere, 1 Thess. 
2:19: "You are my glory and defiance, my joy and crown 
of honor in the day of the Lord, when | will draw you forth 
to be my witnesses and make my fame real. 


1704 en. (2) 18, 336-338. sermon on 1 John 4, 16-21. 


W. IX, 1291-1293. 1705 





However, even though he has and must have such 
defiance, he is not blessed because of it, as St. Paul 
also says in 1 Cor. 4:4: "| am aware of nothing, but that 
does not make me righteous"; | do have a good 
conscience and joy, but not against God Himself in His 
judgment, but before the world and all creatures, so that 
none of them can punish me, but everything good must 
be said of me. Yes, | also have the glory (he says 
elsewhere, 2 Cor. 11, 10.) that | can not only boast about 
my life and everything that others may boast about, but 
also about my suffering and affliction, that | have 
suffered so much innocently and acted so evil. | will 
boast of all this, but in such a way that | do not rely on 
God being merciful to me and giving me heaven, for 
there is another glory that | do not find in myself, but only 
in Christ. | will certainly boast about this before men and 
before God, so that he will also say yes to it, but this 
glory must first exist before him, otherwise it will not be 
valid before him either. 

55. Therefore | say: Against God | rely on nothing but 
Christ; but after this defiance and glory | will stand with 
you before God, as St. Paul did with those of Corinth, 
and say: You know that | have preached rightly and 
faithfully, and that no one has yet harmed or hurt you. 
Each one must truly have this glory against the other, or 
even be guided by it, even if he does not do enough for 
his neighbor, or has behaved improperly, so that he 
nevertheless reconciles himself with him. For if we did 
not have such glory, we would also have to do away with 
the ten commandments. Therefore, we must live in such 
a way that we may call upon God to judge between us 
and all men, and testify before Him that we have lived 
rightly and Christianly. 

(56) So now you have it both ways, that faith boasts 
against God, and thereby quiets and puts away his 
wrath, which otherwise we would have deserved, and 
only braves the fact that we have a Savior, Jesus Christ, 
through whom we are reconciled. This is our foundation 
and cornerstone, on which our confidence finally and 
eternally stands, and we know when all things are 
lacking and of ourselves nothing can boast. 





that we have a high priest 1) seated at the right hand of 
the Father, who bore our sin in his own body, and 
sacrificed himself for us, and still represents us without 
fail, and speaks the best for us, that through him we may 
have mercy and forgiveness, and fear no wrath (as we 
well deserve). This is our highest defiance and strongest 
glory, by which we overcome sin, death, hell, and our 
own conscience; for to this we were baptized, and 
therefore shall live and die, and suffer all things that 
befall us. 

57. The other, however, is that love boasts and 
defies, not against God, but against and against the 
whole world, that we have done everything according to 
our ability, or would gladly do so, so that no one can 
stand up and complain against us that we have 
deliberately offended, stolen or robbed him, or broken 
the ten commandments against him; And so to be 
haughty and proud against the wicked and shameful 
world, that it should not boast against us, but that we 
should suffer against it, as those who are of it, that it 
should put us to vain ingratitude and all plagues for our 
good deeds and love, that it may itself bear witness to 
us at the last day that we have so lived, and by our works 
show that we have been Christians. But whether we are 
still frail, and do not do as much as we would like, we 
hold ourselves to that chief article of Christ. For here we 
may always count on grace and forgiveness, both from 
God and among ourselves, as the Lord's Prayer teaches 
us, and the confession must always remain that we are 
sinners before God. And whether we can boast before 
the world: | have stolen from no one, nor have | done 
wrong, but before God we must say, "| have stolen too 
much from you, and have broken all the Ten 
Commandments. But this is my glory, that thou hast 
blotted out such a record, and hast not reckoned with 
me, but hast let all things be forgiven through Christ. If 
then we are reconciled to God and are one, we may well 
keep the boast against men, that they shall not lay 
anything against us, that they may accuse or condemn 
us before him.

(58) From this you see that we do not condemn 
works as we are blamed, but rather exalt and praise 
them, so that through them we may have joy even in the 
sight of God when He judges. For these are truly good 
works in the sight of God, and it would be foolishness for 
me not to call them good works, and to take them for 
preaching the gospel, or for serving my neighbor in his 
position, and not to lift up my eyes and look joyfully at the 
whole world and defy it to say otherwise. For these are 
the works that God Himself has commanded to be done 
toward one another, so that | can say, "These are truly 
divine works. If they are divine works, then they must 
also have glory and praise, so that they are regarded as 
such, and not discarded or despised as loose, futile, 
incompetent works (as the monks and all great saints are 
works of their own choosing, which have no word of God, 
and do not proceed from love), but praised for such 
works, which God Himself must praise, and both angels, 
saints and all the world must say yes to them, so that 
every Christian can refer to them before God. As the 
saints in the Scriptures have done everywhere, as David 
in the Psalter; item, the prophet Jeremiah Cap. 17, 16: 
"Lord, you know what | have preached, that is right in 
your sight." Item, the king Ezechia Is. 38, 3.: 
"Remember, O Lord, how | have walked before thee in 
truth with a perfect heart, and have done that which was 
pleasing in thy sight. "2c. 

(59) But when God comes with His judgment, where 
is the glory? Since the Scriptures say everywhere that 
no human holiness can stand before Him, would one 
have to forsake glory and even despair? Answer: No, not 
so; for | have said that this glory is valid before God, but 
not against God, or with God, that is, between Him and 
me alone. For there | have already the other glory, that | 
am baptized into Christ, and the heaven of grace is 
drawn over me, whether | have sinned, or still sin 1). But 
if it goes against the people, and is to boast how | have 
lived in my state at 


1) Erlanger: stho. 


| will nevertheless say this: | testify before you and all the 
world, and | know that God also testifies to me, together 
with all the angels, that | have not falsified God's word, 
baptism and sacrament, but have preached rightly and 
faithfully, and have done as much as was in me, and 
have suffered all evil for it, solely for the sake of God and 
His word. So all saints must have 2) (as said) both the 
glory of faith toward God, and also the glory of love 
before men, so that they are both with each other, and 
the other grows out of the first. 3) For he who can boast 
against God can also easily defy the world. 

(60) This is what St. John calls glory or joy on the day 
of judgment, that he can have God and all the world as 
witnesses against all enemies and the devil. And calls it 
a true, full love, which shows and can prove that man 
has done and suffered what he should; and is not a false, 
colored, yes, a living love, which only confesses Christ, 
as far as it does no harm, and serves the neighbor, 4) as 
far as nothing is taken from him, but which reaches into 
it with earnestness, and has the right core and marrow 
in it. But it does not follow from this that this is enough, 
and that faith is not needed, but rather that righteous 
faith must first be present, which can boast before God 
of the Lord Christ, and recover from the same where we 
lack it. But when it is there, then you may also cheerfully 
praise love against all the world, as St. Paul does 
everywhere, and makes so much of the praise that one 
would think he was a trustworthy man. But it is 
necessary, as St. John shows here, to have joy in the 
day of judgment against the evil world, which 
blasphemes and persecutes us everywhere, and would 
gladly condemn and destroy all things. 

(61) That is to say, love is rightly praised and 
powerfully preached; not like the useless rag-washers, 
the papists, who preached

much slobbering about works, and crying out hostilely, 
that one must not preach of faith alone, and yet know 
nothing of saying how to believe, or how and why to love, 
without piecing and dripping here one work, and there 
one work. But we do not teach one work or two, but more 
and greater works than you can ever do, but with the 
proper difference that the two, love and faith, are not to 
be thrown together, but finely divided: that faith goes up 
to God and deals with him alone, but love has to do on 
earth with everyone, and must defy and boast against all 
the world. So they will not and cannot teach, but either 
give everything to works, or leave love altogether, and 
think that it is enough that they can say much about faith. 

62. But stay on this right middle road, so that you 
keep both the main glory against God, where we finally 
and thoroughly have to put our trust, on which we are 
also baptized and both have to live and die, which is our 
Lord Christ, who has washed away our sin by his 
courage, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, 
giving us everything: And besides this, you can also 
boast and defy the odds of 1) your love, so that it does 
not stand in mere words, but can stand before God's 
judgment, and there prove that it was a right untainted 
faith, and a righteous complete love, which shows its 
virtue and nature by right works, so that it can be seen 
and grasped. 2c. Now he continues, and once again 
invokes God as an example, so that he may keep us in 
divine love, and comfort us when we feel bad about it, 
and feel as if it is too difficult and unbearable for us to 
always practice love in the evil world and among the 
poisonous, evil people. 


For as he is, so are we in this 2) world. 


63 There is the end of it. The servant should not be

and he wanted to go and lie down on roses. Now it 
happens here that God has to suffer from all the world 
for his unspeakable love, that they show him vain 
ingratitude for it, despise his word and work, and 
blaspheme and persecute him. For how many are they 
who thank Him once for some good deed or gladly give 
up a penny for His sake, when God gives them all kinds 
of goods in abundance? They live as if they had the right 
and it was given to them that they should use his gifts 
according to their will. Since we now see that God 
Himself is doing so with His love in the competition, we 
may consider that we will not have it any better, and 
neither wonder nor be angry, as if something strange or 
special were happening to us, but rather be glad about 
it, and the more joyfully defy and boast, as He can boast 
and defy (even though it is not yet at all the same thing, 
with our love and patience, and all that we are able, 
against the divine love and patience, which He must 
suffer from the world), 3) that we may be the more 
provoked to follow the same example, and not consider 
whether we must also suffer something, which, to reckon 
against Him, is much too little and small. 

(64) For nothing else will come of serving the world 
eternally, that it may suffer and give thanks for it, but 
nothing else can come of it, but pious people, who gladly 
do it all good, persecute, defile and blaspheme it, since 
it has no cause, and must think of something to blame it, 
even if it should break it from an old fence; as they did to 
Christ himself. Since they could not deny his good deeds 
and miracles, and yet could not suffer them, they had to 
say: he casts out 4) the devils by Beelzebub, the devils’ 
chief. Item, since he had helped all the people, and could 
not raise a complaint against him, nor did they have to 
call him rebellious before Pilato. Therefore, do not think 
that the world should recognize our good works or leave 
them unpunished, but even though they shine brightly, 
they must cover them up as under a dunghill, with their 
debauchery and defilement, so that they are even given 
to the devil.

Whoever does not want to consider this, may let Christ 
go, or leave the world. But he who wants to be a 
Christian must take comfort in the fact that it cannot go 
any other way, nor should it go any other way, because 
God Himself does it this way; and must act like a good 
apple tree, which offers its fruit to everyone, and bears 
and scatters it openly, even among the swine and evil 
beasts that tear it up. 

Therefore, let us also live in such a way (St. John 
wants to say) that we may always keep such defiance of 
love until the day of judgment, and be able to say before 
God: Dear Lord, it has happened to me just as it 
happened to you. | have done everyone's best, and 
gladly served all the world, but it has also thanked and 
rewarded me as it did you, with venomous hatred and all 
malice, so that we may be like God and boast with him 
(although our glory is nothing compared to his), so that 
the world may not raise anything against us, nor pretend 
to excuse itself, as if we had not told it, advised it, and 
done everything we should do to help it; But that we may 
put down her glory, and against it have every right to 
complain against her, because she will not now be 
wronged nor punished, and have neither counseled nor 
helped her of us, but for that very cause persecuted and 
condemned us. 

(66) But in that day it shall be found and made 
manifest before God and all creatures, that he shall say 
unto her, | have given thee heaven and earth, the sun 
and the moon, and all goods, and have caused my 
gospel to be preached to thee, to save thee out of thy 
sins and thy miseries, and have offered thee all grace 
and eternal life freely. But how did you stand against it? 
Like a desperate evil fruit of the devil, which neither 
wanted to recognize nor accept any benefit or grace, but 
strived and raged against it to the utmost. In the same 
way, all the saints will then stand and testify against and 
against them, saying: We have served thee with our 
bodies and lives, and have helped thee faithfully and 
gladly for thy salvation and all good things; this thou 
canst not deny, and the same out of full right love, as the 
right love of God is and is. For if it were not right perfect 
and divine love, then 


We will take a different view of the matter and say, as 
the world is wont to do among itself: | would let you have 
hellish fire and all misfortune, that | should do you more 
good. For why should we be allowed to burden 
ourselves with all people's hatred and enmity, contempt, 
travel and misfortune for nothing? Which we might well 
be above, if we would seek our own, and also give leave 
to the world, and say unto it, If thou be such a herb, the 
devil love thee. 

67. But true love does not do this; it does not let any 
thing, neither evil nor good, love nor suffering, hinder it, 
but always continues with its love, and does not see 
what the world does, or what it deserves, but how God 
does, and what he suffers because of his love, and 
always sings its little song: | have not begun anything for 
your sake, but for the praise of God and for your good; 
if you do not want to recognize it, we will save it until that 
day, when we will read the register against each other, 
and you will also have to hear my praise, and make it 
true without your thanks, with your eternal harm. 

68 Behold, so shall a Christian be equipped, that he 
may be like unto his Lord, and have such glory as he 
hath, and for his sake do all that love can do. For this is 
a fine and glorious consolation, that at the last day we 
shall be able to plead that we are like him, and that he 
will bear us witness and boast himself before all the 
world. Just as it happened to the prophet Samuel in 1 
Sam. 12:3, when he defied his judgment against his 
people, whether he had ever taken anything from them 
or desired anything from them, God said to him, Cap. 
8:7: "They have not cast you away, but me, that | should 
not be their Lord." 

69 Because we know and believe this, we can also 
despise the world as defiantly as it does us. For what do 
| care, if |am a Christian, that the world should condemn 
my preaching, or pay all my good works with 
ingratitude? What have | lost by it, or they gained by it? 
Nothing, but that she will be deprived of her glory at the 
last day, and will have to leave it to me without her 
thanks, and condemn herself, even though she surely 
despises it now, and will not give it to me.

in the wind. How could she harm herself more, or benefit 
me more, if she did or gave everything she had and was 
able to? 

70. For this reason a Christian is a blessed man and 
a mighty lord, more than all lords and all that is great on 
earth, even though he is despised, poor, miserable and 
afflicted in the eyes of the world, that he may defy and 
boast against everyone, and no one can do him any 
harm, even though the world tries all its wickedness and 
malice on him, as little as it is able to harm God; For he 
becomes like God, and has the very glory that God has; 
and this he attains only by doing love and good to 
everyone, and in return suffers all suffering and evil, just 
as God, his Lord, does. Why then should we fear, or why 
should we be angry and grumble, when we come to 
such honor and glory, and at the same time say with 
God to the world, "What have | done to you, that you 
persecute and blaspheme me so shamefully? Have | 
always helped thee and done thee all good? | would not 
give the glory for the sake of all the world's good and 
honor. For even if we do not earn heaven with it, it is 
comforting to us now and an eternal honor hereafter, 
and serves to make the world ashamed, so that it will 
have to stand before us with all its shame, and may not 
lift its eyes against us. 

See, St. John wants to incite us to righteous love, 
which the world does not have nor can have. For it 
cannot and will not suffer anything for it, and as soon as 
it feels ingratitude, it rages and rages as if it wanted to 
tear down heaven and earth; it can do nothing but 
reproach and reproach everyone for what it has done. 
But it will not do in the sight of God to boast of other 
people's ingratitude and wickedness, thereby letting 
yourself be overcome and your love extinguished; and 
you have already lost your reward and comfort, because 
you do it only for the sake of 1) fame, and just by this 
you have ruined and lost your glory in the sight of God. 

(72) But a Christian does not base his glory on other 
people's piety or wickedness, but looks to God that he 
may have such glory, saying, "My Lord has given me the 
glory of God. 


1) Erlanger: um. 


He has given me life and limb, his grace and all goods, 
which | have not earned, and much more than | need or 
can consume for myself. Therefore, | will serve and 
share with other people as much as | can, and | will not 
cease to do good, just as he does not cease to do good 
to me and to all the world. If they thank me, it is good; if 
not, it is just as much, for | should not and will not do 
better than my God and my Lord Christ, who gives all his 
creatures into the hands of evil tyrants and villains, and 
showers them with all goods, and yet earns nothing with 


them but the beautiful Deo gratias, that they blaspheme 
and disgrace him without ceasing. So also, his Son 
Christ lets himself be crucified, carries our sins on his 
neck, and dies for the whole world, that it may live, and 
be redeemed and free from sins and the power of the 
devil. But she goes to him, and will not hear such 
preaching nor suffer it, blasoheming and persecuting his 
preachers and Christians, and setting up all false 
worship and his own holiness in defiance and vexation 
of him. This is how he has to pay, the dear faithful Savior. 
Since he is not better off, what wonder is it that we are 
thanked, or what better thing can we do and hope for? 

73 Therefore, learn to practice such righteous works 
of love, which, as | have said, and St. John also says in 
this epistle, is not in thought or word, but must be shown 
in deed with all one's heart. John also says in this epistle, 
is not in thought or word, but must be shown in deed 
from the heart, that one helps, advises and does the best 
for everyone, with all one's strength and ability; and that 
such a righteous heart and earnestness be, which does 
not let itself be deterred, whether one on the other hand 
grants it [love] the very worst or says and does it, and 
turns and interprets everything in the worst way. 
Otherwise love is not perfect nor righteous, but only 
colored, and a sign that one does not do it for God's 
sake, nor follows Him, but stands only on other people's 
piety and thanksgiving, which should stand on faith and 
the Lord Christ. Therefore it shall not hinder thee, that 
for his ingratitude thou shouldest injure him, or corrupt 
him, or wish him evil; for

He will find enough hell and devils where he will not. So 
then love stands right on its right ground, as it should 
stand; not from your neighbor, but on your faith, and 
arises according to the right divine love. 

Therefore | have often said, and must still boast (just 
as St. Paul did), and the longer the more: | would have 
long since given up preaching and teaching, and no man 
should be able to do it, if | should not do it for God's sake 
alone; for | have reason to say to half the people every 
day: Now go and help yourselves, or another in my 
place. For it grieves me more than any thing on earth 
that | must daily see and feel such shameful ingratitude, 
especially from those who should be our best friends and 
dearest brethren. 1) But it must be as Christ did. But it 
must be as Christ says John 13:18: "He who eats my 
bread tramples me underfoot," and we must eat it into 
ourselves and overcome it, and always comfort 
ourselves that it was not started for their sake, nor left for 
their sake, but started for God's sake, for the good of 
everyone who wants it, and stayed that way. If they 
trample us underfoot and fill both our hands with it, we 
must take it as a good thing and not be surprised, 
because it is not happening to us but rather to him, but 
still without any harm to us. 

75 For we will also boast with Paul, 2 Tim. 4:7, 8: "I 
have fought a good fight, | have finished the race, | have 
kept the faith. Henceforth there is appended unto me the 
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous 
Judge, shall give me at that day. "2c. Behold, how proud 
is this man with his righteousness, when he otherwise 
confesses himself a sinner everywhere, and wants to be 
nothing everywhere; and even though he says in 1 Cor. 
4:4 that he is not aware of anything, yet for this reason 
he does not consider himself righteous before God. But 
for the sake of his race or office, he boasts about himself 
to the highest degree, and does not want to be deprived 
of such glory, as he says in 1 Cor. 9, 15: "I would rather 
die, than that someone should destroy my glory. 


1) Jenaer: terrible. 





And this shall be his crown and glorious ornament at the 
last day, that he hath faithfully executed his office, and 
hath helped the ungrateful world; though he attain not 
salvation thereby, but by Christ and his baptism. 

(76) Now all these things are for this purpose, and 
are preached for this reason, that we not only do love 
and good works gladly, but also do not throw them to the 
wind or regard them lightly, but know that God regards 
them as glorious and great. Otherwise, who could bear 
to work day and night and serve everyone, if he did not 
know whom he was working for and what benefit he was 
bringing about, and if it was all vain labor? As it is evil in 
the world and is lost; but it is not lost before God for that 
reason. Therefore we should also consider this great and 
glorious, so that we can boast before God with a good 
conscience, and he confirms such glory; yes, to become 
like him in it, because we see that it is just like us, so that 
we do not have cause to complain, nor become tired or 
weary3) of doing good, and do not look at what the world 
does, but how God does both to it and to us without 
ceasing. 


Fear is not in love, but complete love 
casts out fear. 


With these words he interprets what he means for a 
joyfulness on the day of judgment, of which he said, 
namely, that one should not then fear or be frightened. 
For true love does not suffer fear, that is, an evil, 
desponding, fleeting conscience, which bites, and 
laments, O woe, | never did no good 2c., but where there 
is love, there is an undaunted, joyful, and undaunted 
heart and conscience, which is not afraid nor afraid of a 
rustling leaf; but will surely let towers fall, thunder, 
lightning, and weather pass, and be angry who will not 
laugh, and stand firm, cheerful, and bold. For such a one 
knows that he can remain well before everyone, and no 
one has to complain against him. Not that by this he can 
put away the fear of his conscience from his sin and 
God's judgment or

W. IX, 1306-1309. 





But as he said above of the glory and joy which we have 
through love toward men, so he says also of the same 
fear, that it should not be thrown together, nor drawn into 
this text, what is said of the fear which we have before 
God. For he did not intend here to speak of what we call, 
according to the Scriptures, the fear of God, which is a 
good, praiseworthy fear, not a fear or trembling, but a 
fear that God honors, which should always be with a 
Christian, just as a pious child fears his father. Nor of the 
fear or trembling of the heart in high spiritual matters, but 
still remains in that which he began to speak, namely, of 
love toward one's neighbor, and what this benefits and 
gives, namely, that one may defy all the world, and be 
afraid of no one; that it all may remain here, when one is 
to act toward men. 

For that one may boast against God 1) and be without 
fear, something higher belongs to it (as has been said) 
than our loving and working. There the devil can make 
this text even false to us, when it comes to the high battle 
of faith, where the heart must stand in fear and 
disputation, whether God is gracious to it 2c., by which 
he so crushes the devout hearts that they do not know 
where to stay, and probably consume all their strength, 
sap and marrow over it; as David writes of himself in 
many psalms, since there is so much miserable and sad 
lamentation of terror, fear and anxiety, that it is to be 
wondered at by such great holy people; and the Lord 
Christ himself had to feel such anguish in the garden, 
that the sweat of blood flowed mildly from him, and bore 
such fear and terror for us, and overcame in himself, and 
we alone have to overcome through and in him. 

79 Therefore faith alone has to struggle with the 
same [fear], and it only happens to those who already 
have a strong faith and spirit, and also lead a blameless 
life, and do much good and suffer, that they must not be 
afraid of anyone; just as the holy man is not afraid of 
anyone. 


1) Erlanger: could. 





Apostle St. Paulo, who works day and night on the 
Gospel with all his strength, and suffers all kinds of 
hardships, journeys and troubles because of it; But 
nevertheless, over such a holy life (of which he boasts 
against everyone that he is not aware of anything, that 
he has not acted unfaithfully or falsely with anyone), he 
still has to fight with the devil and suffer that he frightens 
him and makes him stupid, and so weak that he can 
hardly live, and always complains how he has to bear 
fear inwardly, terror outwardly, and is in anguish 
everywhere. 2c., 2 Cor. 7, 5. This is called the fear of 
weak faith, since faith struggles with God and yet in such 
weakness _ is victorious through God's power and 
strength. But this is too high and not to be dealt with here. 

80 So we remain here in the lower degree, where it 
can be understood very well, namely, that this remains 
the apostle's opinion: If you live in love and prove your 
faith in such a way that no one can reproach your life and 
work before God, then you have joy and can be secure 
and without worry, and put away all fear. For the devil 
cannot take such things away, even though he 
blasphemes them with evil, poisonous words, and is able 
to prevent me from boasting that | have been baptized 
and am a Christian, that | have led a divine state or office, 
and that | have waited for it with all diligence. Therefore 
thou mayest well defy it, and keep a merry heart, both 
against the devil and against all the world, that they may 
leave thee unaccused and undaunted. Otherwise, where 
this is not the case, and the devil and death press upon 
a man, the heart soon begins to sink, and melts like the 
snow before the sun: O woe, | have been too near to my 
neighbor here and there, | have not conducted my estate 
rightly, nor faithfully attended to my office, and have 
sought only my own advantage, temporal honor and 
thanksgiving with it, and vain woe and anguish and terror 
come upon him, in his own heart. Although it is true that 
one should therefore not despair in any way, but hold fast 
with faith in Christ, that we are baptized in him, and have 
forgiveness of sins; nevertheless, one cannot avoid fear 
or terror, and if faith receives a great blow, that it is 
weakened, as it is not well planted, nor rooted and 
grounded. 


1718 en. (s) is, 351-353. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. 





But if he is not well trained, he stands very weak and 
loose, so that it becomes sour for him to remain before 
such a storm. Again, where it is well driven, and proves 
itself in works of love, that it is rooted and bears fruit, it 
can remain all the more firm, immovable and unshaken. 

For this reason this epistle is not directed against 
faith, as if one should build the foundation of salvation 
on works, or for the sake of it let our confidence fall on 
Christ, but against the sure, false Christians, who boast 
much about faith, so that they see and do not deceive 
themselves with such false, vain boasting: | have been 
baptized and am a Christian, therefore | am not allowed 
to do anything more, but seek that their faith may be 
rightly rooted and grounded, and so try and prove itself 
that it may stand firm, and overcome the shocks and 
tempests of terror. Otherwise, your glory and security 
will soon fade away and vanish like the smoke in the air; 
and it will not do for you to rely on it, thinking (as the 
sophists also teach) that if you have only a speck of 
grace and faith, that is enough for salvation; but beware, 
if you have no more than such a speck, and leave it in 
the ashes, lest the devil come and pour a bucket full of 
water into it, and your faith and everything go out. 

For it requires much to make and keep the faith 
strong. But it becomes strong, as St. Peter, 2 Ep. 1, 8, 
and St. John teach in this epistle. John teaches in this 
epistle, when we feel it and it breaks out externally in our 
lives, like a flame from a small spark when we blow into 
it; which otherwise always diminishes and finally dies out 
on its own if it is not preserved, and like the young seed 
in a dry field, if it is sown correctly; but where it has no 
sap, and in addition the sun comes on it with its heat, it 
must soon wither. 

It is true that whoever has the grace to go forth with 
faith as a baptized child, or to take hold of Christ as the 
thief did on the cross, is fine and good, even though he 
cannot boast of any good works. Just as the same thief 





1719 


John. w. ix, 1309-1311. 


publicly, both himself and the Jews, confessing or 
praising and calling on Christ alone, Luc. 23:40-42. But 
this is not for everyone, and no unbeliever can do it; nor 
can anyone who is still weak and untried in the faith. 
Therefore beware that you do not save it to the last hour, 
nor rely on it as if you could always come to faith, lest 
you lack it and come too late, and so dry up and wither 
away that you have nothing, nor find anything when you 
ought to have it. This is also what St. Paul means when 
he preaches about love, 1 Cor. 13:1: "If | spoke with the 
tongues of men and with the tongues of angels"; item, v. 
2: "If | had all faith, so as to move mountains, and had 
not love, | would be nothing" 2c. For if a man thus goes 
safely in the delusion, as if he had faith, and yet never 
experiences it, he must rot and wither, and nothing is 
found anywhere, when it comes to the meeting, where it 
should be found. 

The apostles saw this, and so do we. For the world 
always remains in such a way that it either boasts falsely 
of faith, or wants to be too holy without faith. If one 
preaches about faith and grace, no one wants to do 
works. If one is driven to works, then no one wants to 
believe, and those who keep to the right middle road are 
strange. Yes, it is also difficult for devout Christians. For 
| confess for myself, and no doubt others must also 
confess, that | lack such diligence and earnestness, 
which | should have now much more than before, and 
am much more negligent than under the papacy, and 
now there is nowhere such earnestness in the Gospel 
as was seen before with monks and priests, since so 
much was endowed and built, and no one was poor who 
did not want to give something. But now there is not one 
city that wants to feed a preacher, and nothing goes but 
vain robbing and stealing among the people, and let no 
one defend them. Where does such a shameful plague 
come from? From the teaching (say the screamers) that 
one should not build on works nor trust. But it is the 
wicked devil who falsely ascribes such things to the 
pure, wholesome doctrine, that his own and the people's

The heart should not be frightened when it knows itself 
guilty of such an unchristian life. Therefore it is a great 
freedom and salvation from such fear, which is against 
love and grows from below, that is, against the world, 
that it must leave you satisfied and innocent. But this 
does not take away the fear that comes down from 
above from God's wrath and judgment, unless it comes 
first through another man, who is called Jesus Christ, 
who was baptized with his baptism and gospel, and is 
not of our work or ability, but only of his gift. 

90. But do you say, "Yes, where is the man who has 
done such things as St. John demands and may boast 
of himself, that he has lived all things blamelessly in 
love? | would like to see him. Answer: We do not dispute 
whether there is anyone who has achieved this and is 
so completely perfect that he lacks nothing, but we 
preach and urge that people strive for this, that they are 
serious, and that they act as if they wanted to do and live 
in this way, otherwise no one will be found who is so 
pure and holy in life that he does not do too much or too 
little; otherwise the Lord's Prayer, in which Christ 
teaches all his apostles and saints to pray like this, 
would be false: Forgive us our trespasses 2c. As even 
now the Anabaptists and all sorts of cults have hitherto 
presumed to do wrong, who have led such holy and 
austere lives that they should not seek forgiveness of 
sin. But we do not want to do the Lord's Prayer wrongly, 
and we do not want to throw away this article, but rather 
keep it as our highest treasure, since our salvation and 
happiness lie in it. 

91. For our flesh and blood and this life do not suffer 
us to be without sin and various infirmities; but we should 
see to it that we do not sink into them and let them rule 
over us, but stand and work to do what our office or 
position and the love of our neighbor demands, and 
where we have been lacking or negligent, that we mend 
our ways, and so stand daily in resolution and diligence, 
and always continue in them, and not leave them. Yes, 
even if someone has stumbled or gone too far to the 
side, he can still get back on his feet.

and keep to the road, and only do not take the wrong 
road. Thus, he can always retain the glory that he has 
devoted himself to love for everyone and remain free of 
the fear that the world cannot punish him for the sake of 
his life, because his whole life has been directed toward 
doing the best for everyone. If, however, there remains 
some deficiency in it, and not all the individual pieces are 
so purely exquisite, the world has neither to judge nor to 
blame, but belongs to the register called forgiveness of 
sins. 

(92) Thus a Christian always has the advantage (St. 
John says) of keeping a joyful heart and courage, even 
in the presence of God in judgment, so that he may not 
be afraid, nor have pain and anguish of conscience, as 
one who has not lived in love. For he knows that the 
world cannot justly punish or condemn him. Although 
this is not possible, that a man should be able to do right 
by everyone, and the world should not reprove and judge 
his life and work, even if he were the most excellent and 
perfect. But whoever wants to look at how people judge 
him, and whoever dares to make the world praise him, | 
have no other advice for him than to put on a gray skirt 
and run away from all people into the desert, and 
become a hermit, then he would be considered holy. But 
not to me such holiness; for it will not stand before God's 
judgment in the end, nor have the glory of remaining in 
love. 

If you are a Christian, you should not care how the 
world treats you, for it is no different, that it should not 
reproach and judge something, even if it is only a little 
warmth under the eyes, even if the face and the body 
are completely pure and beautiful. Yes, she cannot 
refrain from giving false judgment, contempt, and 
ingratitude to the pious for their good deeds and good 
works. Therefore we too must despise her again, and 
nevertheless continue, and with our love retain our glory 
and joy, and nevertheless defy God's judgment. Then 
we will dispute with her and show her what good works 
we have done, of which she has none.

but blasphemed and profaned: let her then, without her 
thanks, and with everlasting reproach and harm, punish 
and condemn her own blasphemous mouth, and praise 
and glorify us all the more gloriously, as much more as 
she now blasphemes and reproaches. 

94. | will (if God wills) on the last day also bring a 
good record of my good works, so that | have served the 
world and everyone, even my worst enemies, against 
my angry tyrants and enemies, and who they are, the 
coarse donkey heads and lying mouths, who now can 
do nothing at all but cry and blaspheme against Luther, 
so that they will have to praise and exalt me gloriously, 
and cry alas and woe over themselves that | should not 
now take the goods, honor and praise of all the world for 
their blasphemy and defilement. For this shall be my 
beautiful crown, as of most precious gold and stones. 

For this reason a Christian must not do more than 
see to it that he directs his ministry rightly through love, 
so that glory may be found and not remain outside, and 
the more glorious and greater, the more he must suffer 
dishonor and contempt before the world. If it does not 
please the world, there is nothing in it. Nor is it pleasing 
to the devil, nor shall it be pleasing to him; and so it shall 
be called: For the sake of her blasphemy and poisonous 
mouth nothing 1) has been done nor left; but she again 
shall suffer from us, that we now so highly despise her 
and defy her, and afterwards at the last judgment shall 
make true and confirm our glory with her own testimony, 
and [the world shall] 2) have no thanks nor grace to 
reward with God. 

96) Now you understand what St. John means by 
these words: "Fear is not in love, but perfect love casts 
out fear," namely, that this much is said: "It does not 
suffer one another that a true Christian, who is not a 
hypocrite, but righteous and loves in deed, should be 
afraid and terrified, but has already cast out fear, which 
follows where love does not exist, since the heart soon 
begins to

He shudders, even from his own thoughts, when it occurs 
to him: "This is how you should have lived; this and that 
you did not do. That is why he says: "Fear is a torment", 
that is, it makes the heart afraid and woebegone, so that 
it does not know where to stay, and is a real torment in 
hell. Who does not know this, try it. 

(97) And indeed it can be seen in many who, because 
of their sins, are in trepidation and terror of conscience 
when the hour comes, how they act so fearfully and 
miserably that many of them kill themselves. But this is 
not felt and respected by the great, raw multitude, who go 
safely along, and only load more and more sin upon 
themselves, as long as the hour also comes, and the 
repentance presses: so then it is resisted to the last, that 
they know no more help nor counsel. 

For it is hard and difficult for the pious when the devil 
comes upon them, even with false fear and terror, 
because he makes them conscience of small or trivial 
things, or even of good works; just as he is a master of 
making sin and of making it more sinful, and can blow a 
great fire out of a little spark. That | would set myself as 
an example, how in such a case he often drew many a 
sweat from me, and made my heart throb, before | threw 
myself about, and took my defense from God's word, 
namely my commanded office and my service, which | 
have done to the world, which he must not make false. 
For where you do not have this, he can soon rush you, 
and press you as if the whole world were on his neck. As 
if, when he sees the hour coming, he will once attack our 
mobs and fanatics, and hold nothing else up but this: 
"Listen, Squire, what have you preached and done? Who 
told you to do it, or called you to do it? And will make them 
so afraid with this one word that | would not gladly take 
ten worlds and suffer such pain if | should die. 

(99) For it is also difficult, as | have said, when one 
has lived and done according to God's word and 
command, so that He does not overtake man with His 
terror, and faith must stand for itself in a hard struggle, 
even though love is justified.

1726 en. (s.) 18, 359-361. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. w. Ix, 1319-1321. 


As is said above [§ 48 ff.] of St. Paul and other apostles 
and saints, who boast so defiantly against the world that 
it seems too much, and talk as if they had already won 
the battle: and yet the same, when it comes to faith, 
another battle arises, which fights not with the world, but 
with God. There is no defiance of justice, nor of one's 
life; but only pleading and begging for pure grace, as the 
6th Psalm and many others show. There it is not said: 
Love casts out fear, but Christ casts it out. 

Nevertheless, this glory must also be there to take 
away the fear of the world, otherwise the heart must also 
be in torment. For such a conscience grieves grievously, 
and is the greatest cross on earth, as those know and 
testify who have experienced it. Therefore, we should 
be all the more diligent to overcome such sorrow and 
suffering, so that in this lower degree we may retain a 
joyfulness and defiance toward the world, and not fear 
it, as the dear prophets, apostles and saints have done. 

Behold, the holy apostle St. John has most strongly 
and diligently exhorted to love and its works, against the 
single, worthless Christians, who go along as if it were 
enough and all was accomplished, having heard the 
gospel and been in baptism, and now have done nothing 
more, nor lived; yea, more evil, unfaithfulness, 





Robbing and stealing, as before, as if they had it right, 
and could not spoil it 2c. And warns that they watch, and 
do not deceive themselves, and know that where they 
live thus, there will certainly be no love. But where there 
is no love, there will be no faith either, but mere foam 
and harmful hypocrisy, and no glory nor joy in the heart, 
but terror and fear, anguish and chastisement, when the 
hour comes for everyone to punish you with all justice. 
But again, if you have love, you can prove before God 
and the world, and all creatures, that you have been a 
righteous Christian, that you have not only had the shells 
or husks of faith, and have adorned the doctrine you 
boast of with your life, so that you can defy everyone 
and remain silent, and thus go on happily as one who 
has been baptized into Christ, and has done and 
suffered what he should do and suffer. For we must live 
and die on the fact that our doctrine, life, status and 
ministry come from God's word, and that we serve 
everyone according to our ability. And if there be any 
other lack or infirmity, let Christ take it away, and let it be 
filled with the Lord's Prayer, and let it be forgiven one to 
another through love: so that no man shall have no fear 
in his heart, but that his heart through Christ shall stand 
against sin, the devil, and death, and through love 
against the world and all the power thereof, amen.

E. D. Martin Luther's sermon on the words 1 John 5:4, 5. 


All that is born of GOD overcomes the world 2c. 


Suspended for the provost at Leitzkau.*) 
1512. 


Translated from Latin. 


Since the holy apostle John wants to preach a 
sermon to us today to heal our infirmities and to set our 
feet on the path of peace, he calls down from heaven in 
this way and begins [1 John 5:4, 5]: 


Everything that is born of God overcomes the 
world; and our faith is the victory that overcomes the 
world. But who is he that overcometh the world, 
except he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 


But all doctrine is such that those who do not know the 
letters and words of it are incomprehensible to those 
who speak, and again, those who speak "do not 
understand what they say or what they say," as the 
apostle writes to Timothy [1 Ep. 1:7]: so it is also 
necessary for us to first learn the language of the 


apostle and what it expresses (signum ejus). Therefore 
it must be said what this birth is, what the world is, and 


what the victory is. 

The birth of God is the begetting by which we are 
born of God. For the same John says in the 5th chapter 
[v. 18, Vulg.]: "We know that whoever is born of God 
does not sin, but the begetting of God preserves him, 
and the wicked will not touch him." But this begetting 
happens by nothing else than by the word of God, as 
Jacobus Cap. 1, 18. says: "According to His will", he 
says, 


It is quite common for this apostle St. John to speak 
of the birth from God by which we are born in Christ. He 
attributes this to faith, as he also says in the Gospel 
[John 1:12 ff]: "To those he gave power to become 
children of God who believe in his name. Who are born, 
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of 
man, but of GOD." Since it is 





*It was nothing unusual in Luther's time that higher clergymen had their speeches, professors their lectures (cf. Walch, St. Louis Edition, 
Vol. VII, p. |. Note) made by especially qualified people. So Luther, as the title says, made this sermon for the provost of Leitzkau, Georg 
Maskov, so that he could make use of it at an upcoming synod. Because this writing lacks a date, some scholars have assumed that the 
synod in question was the one in Pisa in the year I5II, others (because the sermon already shows a high degree of recognition) that it was 
the Lateran Council in Rome in 1516. However, the Weimar edition (Vol. I, p. 8) has rightly pointed out that the expression used in this writing 
(27): "this church" indicates a district synod and excludes the reference to a general church assembly. The same is confirmed by another 
expression in ?22 of this sermon, "so that in the clergy of a good bishop the light may shine" 2c. Leitzkau (also called "Kloster Liezke" from a 
Premonstratensian monastery formerly located there; lat*kau bei Vuriiaker, lom. |, col. 28; I*eit*ksn ii)i<1., lom. Il, lol. | and 2; in the original 
Latin of our writing: Utriku) is located in the so-called Mittelmark between Dessau and Magdeburg and belonged to the bishopric of 
Brandenburg, Hieronymus Scultetus. In the bishop's castle at Ziesar (four miles east of Burg) a synod was held on June 22, 1512, and at the 
opening of it the bishop had an "exhortation" addressed to the assembled clergy concerning the improvement of life and correction of 
deficiencies (ckokoetuuru) that had been brought to him. This "exhortation", we assume with the Weimar edition, was our sermon. Maskov 
was present at the meeting. - In print, this sermon did not appear until 1708 in Albert Meno Verpoortens "8uoru superiori" novi unaleotu, p. 
198. Verpoorten, pastor in Sonnenberg, took it from a codex he claims was written in 1553. "Its publication," says the Weimar edition, "gives 
the impression of a faithful work. From it it is reprinted, but dissolutely, in L6scher's Reformation Acta, p. 221; after Loscher with all its errors 
in the Erlangen edition, opp. var. arA, I'oln. |, p. 29." Furthermore, this sermon is found in the Weimar edition, Vol. I, p. 8. We have retranslated 
according to this latter edition; from it we also take the incidental remark that the friendship which had formed between Luther and Maskov 
was lasting, and "that after the beginning of the Reformation Georg Maskov remained Luther's ‘greatest benefactor’ and furthered his cause 
among ‘the brothers’.

1731 





"he hath begotten us by the word of truth." "According to}or work of each according to his kind and sex. 


his will," he says, that is, according to his free pleasure, 
freely, not because of our merit or worthiness. For not by 
our seeking, asking, and knocking, but since his mercy 
wills it, by this begetting are all begotten that are 
begotten; and certainly much more than a child is 
begotten according to the flesh, and himself adds, asks, 
earns nothing, but either by the lust of the flesh, or by the 
will of a man. For how could he be formed into the spirit, 
which shall live forever, who could not by his own powers 
be formed into the base sinful flesh, which must soon 
die? Therefore, much more of the heavenly Father is 
needed for the procreation of life in righteousness and 
truth. For on both sides he who is born is nothing; only 
that he cannot be born by his work and by his merit: 


rather he is wholly, in all his being (qui est), in the will of 
the Father, by whom he is begotten according to his will 
and with the good pleasure of the begetter. 

3. But as the begetting is different, one of the flesh, 
the other of the spirit, as the Father is different, one 
heavenly and one earthly, as the child is different, one 
immortal and one mortal, one righteous and one sinner, 
one holy and one unclean: so also the seed is diverse; 
the one a heavenly, which is the word of God ("for by the 
word of truth," saith he, "he hath begotten us"), the other 
a carnal, not the word of truth, but a froth of blood, a 
poison of old sin. 

(4) Therefore children of truth are begotten there, who 
have the power and nature of their seed in them; here 
children of vanity, who also have the power and nature 
of their seed in them, so even that every man is called 
vanity and a lie. For just as from the seed of wheat 
comes forth a stalk of wheat, after that also the same 


(5) But from these words of the apostle James 
something else shines forth. For when he says, "He begat 
us by the word," he clearly distinguishes this heavenly 
birth from every common earthly birth, since the former is 
through the word, the latter through a work and a thing, 


the seed (re seminali). But that he adds "by the word of 
truth", by this he draws our attention to the fact that we 
should also be careful that there is another birth, which is 
indeed by the word, but not by the word of truth, but rather 
by the word of falsehood and vanity: this is indeed by a 
word, and is extraordinarily similar to that heavenly birth, 
and deceives very many, but because it is by the word of 
falsehood, it corrupts all in a terrible way. For we see that 
neither the prophets, nor the apostles, nor even other 
teachers had any greater concern, trouble, and sorrow 


than to resist these counterfeiters (adulteris), the false 
apostles and false prophets. For since these (as it says 


in 2 Cor. 4, 2) counterfeit the word of God (adulterantur), 
they put on the appearance of the word of truth, but under 
the word of God they instill the deadly poison of their 
error, and beget nothing but children of wickedness, 
children of the devil, whose apostles they also are. Thus 
in Ezekiel [Cap. 16, 15. ff. 23, 2. ff.] and in Hosea [Cap. 
1, 2.] the synagogue is accused of having loved 


adulterers (adulteros) and of having been senseless in 
unchastity, that is (as the apostle [2 Tim. 4, 3.] interprets 
it), teachers after whom their ears itch: by their teaching 
and procreation it is fertilized, and children of falsehood 
and wickedness are born. 

(6) This is indeed the most terrible begetting, even 
worse than that which comes from the sinful flesh, 


fruit, wheat: so from the word of truth comes forth nothing | because although the flesh begets a sinner in the spirit to 
but a truthful man, from the seed of sin nothing but aleternal death, the sinner begotten by the flesh can be 
sinful man; then the fruit of both, truth or lie in the word |helped to the nature of the spirit: but the one begotten by 


the adulterous spirit remains irretrievably such a one, 
who must perish. However, he has his origin from the 


1732 L. V. a. 1, 32-34. Sermon on 1 John 5, 4. 5. W. IX, 2755-2758. 


1733 





Birth of the flesh. For since through the flesh a vain and 
wholly lying man is born, it happens that he is also 
carnally minded, not unfrequently under a great 
appearance of the spirit. Now if he follows after that and 
teaches others, his spirit and the spirit of those [who 
hear him] are also begotten by the word of ungodliness 
to a life of ungodliness, or rather to death. And yet they 
live ungodly, are ungodly minded, teach ungodly, as it is 
said in the first Psalm [Ps. 1:1], "Blessed is he that 
walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly." These are 
they who, being carnally minded, go about with the 
same mind in the spirit, and now in a carnal manner 
spiritually, that is, perish in a frightful semblance of the 
spirit. 

(7) But these things concern us, venerable and dear 
priests of Christ. For since this meeting (COnventus), as 


is known (Nimirum), was organized for this reason, so 
that the priests come together, and these who preside 


over the people (populis) are also ministers of this 
spiritual and divine birth, since they are messengers of 
the word of truth, as it is said in Malachi 1) [Cap. 2, 7.It 
is said that the priest is an angel of the LORD of hosts, 
and we are to seek the law of God from his mouth, and 
his lips are to keep the doctrine of God (but the priests 
come together in general to deliberate on the affairs of 
this whole church, and they work, as it is said, towards 
a reformation of both estates (spiritual and secular)): so 
this must be our very greatest and first concern, - and 
yet grant GOD that | may thunder this into your hearts 
with burning and fervent words, and, as the prophet says 
[Ps. 18, 14. 9. 127, 4.]: "Hail and lightnings, devouring 
fire and sharp arrows of a strong man"! This is the most 
necessary thing today, so that the priests may be rich in 
all words of truth. The whole world today is full, even 
flooded, with many and various shameful doctrines: with 
so many laws, so many opinions of men, yes, with so 
many superstitious things, the people are overwhelmed 
everywhere. 


1) In the text erroneously: Laewarias. 


than taught that the word of truth barely glimmers a little, 
and in many places does not even shine now and then. 

(8) And what kind of birth can this be, where the 
procreation is by the word of man, not by the word of 
God? As the word is, so is the birth; as the birth, so is 
the people. We are astonished that in Christ's people 
there is so much disunity, anger, envy, pride, 
disobedience, unchastity, gluttony, that love grows cold, 
faith is extinguished, hope ceases: | beg you, do not be 
astonished. These things are not marvelous. This is our 
fault, the fault of the prelates and priests. We must rather 
marvel at them that they are so blind, so much oblivious 
of their duty, that, when they should have helped this 
birth by the word of truth, they have given themselves 
up to other things, and, being completely occupied 
(suffocati) by cares for temporal affairs, have left that 
entirely undone; but the greater part (as | have said) 
teach fables and human fiddles. And yet we are 
astonished that by such words such a people is 
destroyed! 

(9) Here someone wants to tell me that fornication 
and drinking, gambling and such things are great vices 
and offences and reprehensible to the clergy. | admit 
these are great things, they must be punished, they 
must be changed: but this is acknowledged by all, they 
are gross, bodily things, which one can perceive with the 
senses, therefore they also move the minds. But oh! this 
stain and this corruption is incomparably more harmful 
and horrible, that one does not act the word of truth or 
falsifies it, and this evil is not recognized, moves no one, 
does not frighten, because it does not fall grossly on the 
senses, and yet it alone should be recognized most of 
all. How many priests are there today who would not say 
that it is a greater sin if a priest has fallen into carnal sin, 
if he has not performed his prayers, if he has made a 
mistake in the canon of the Mass, than if he has let the 
word of truth stand or if he has not done it right? For 
these, who are otherwise good and holy people. 


1734 V. a. 1, 34 s. Interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. W. IX, 2758-2762. 


1735 








are in a very serious error. It is only the word of truth in 
which they cannot err, as they make themselves believe, 
while this is almost the only thing in which a priest sins 
as a priest. In other things, of course, he sins, but as a 
man; here, on the other hand, when he leaves the word 
standing or falsifies it, he sins against his office and as a 
priest, that is, he sins far more terribly than when he sins 
as aman. Ah, God be lamented! Nowadays, the bishops 


(pontifices) go about with such hard and unfeeling 
certainty that they not only keep silent about [the word 
of truth], but they also talk among the people about 
everything that comes into their mouths, and yet they 
say that this is preached and taught, taking no account 
of it at all, nor do they fear whether this is the word of 
truth that was given to them at birth from God or not: and 
yet for this word alone they are what they are, that is, 


priests and clerics (clerus), for in all other things there is 
no need of priests. Therefore, if the bishops or priests 
were otherwise perfectly holy and everything was well 
with them (beati), but were negligent in this one thing (as 
almost all of them are), that they did not take care that 
the word of truth be rightly acted, it is certain that they 
would be counted among the wolves, not among the 
shepherds, that they would be considered idols before 
God, not bishops. Otherwise, one may be chaste, he 
may be affable, he may be learned, he may increase the 
income, build houses, increase the episcopal rule 


(ditionem), yes, even do miracles. He may raise the 
dead, cast out devils: but he alone is a priest and a 
shepherd who is an angel of the LORD of hosts, that is, 
a messenger of God, that is, who presides over the 
people with the word of truth and is a servant who helps 
in this birth of God. 

(10) So the dangers for the shepherds do not lie in 
these things, of which so great an importance is 
commonly made: of the sovereignty of the estate, of the 
government of consciences, of the account that must be 
given of the riches and the power; these are trifling 
things; but the greatest of all dangers is that of the power 
of the kingdom of God. 





This is the only way to be sure, if one does not stand by 
the word of truth and does not increase the people of 
Christ, who are increased by this birth alone, are 
nurtured and promoted by this word alone. For the Lord 
commands in the prophet Jeremiah [Cap. 29, 6.] that 
these sons and daughters should be begotten; here he 
commands that we should grow and multiply. For if this 
is observed, it is exceedingly well with the government 
of consciences, with the care of souls, with the elevation 
of status, and it is without danger. 

11. Although you therefore decide many things in this 
venerable synod, if you order everything well, and do not 
lay a hand here, that the priests, the teachers of the 
people, are commanded to abstain from fables, which 
have no certain proof, and to lay on the pure gospel and 
the holy interpreters of the gospels, and to direct their 
attention to it, and to proclaim the word of truth to the 
people with fear and reverence; finally, to abstain from 
any human teachings, or to interfere with them only 
sparingly, indicating their different nature, and thus 
faithfully cooperate in the birth of God: If you, | say, do 
not take care of this with the greatest zeal, with godly 
prayers, with constant earnestness, then | tell you quite 
frankly that everything else is nothing, that we have 
come together in vain, that we have accomplished 
nothing. 

For this is the center around which everything 
revolves, this is the short epitome of a right reformation, 
this is the very essence of all godliness. For what is this 
nonsense and exceedingly great folly, that thou art 
anxious for a good life, and art not rather anxious how 


those are prepared and come into existence (fiant et 


sint) to whom thou givest good moral teachings? Surely 
this is nothing other than building a house to the wind; 
this is the greatest folly of all. 

13. the saying stands firm: the church is not born, nor 
does it exist in its essence, except through the word of 
God. It is said [Jac. 1, 18.]: "He begat us by the word of 
truth.” 

14 So you don't have to look for, treat, accept another 
word, if you don't at the same time 


1736 D- V. a. I- 38-37. sermon on 1 John 5:4, 5. W. IX. 2762-2766. 


also wants to annul the birth of God, to destroy the 
church and to drown the people of Christ in the rivers of 
Egypt after the manner of Pharaoh, that is, to corrupt 
them through the word of men. For as it is true that 
everything that is born of God and from the word of God 
does not sin, so it is also true that everything that is born 
of men and from the word of men sins and is sin, and 
therefore must necessarily perish for eternity. Oh, if only 
God would grant that the rulers of the church, us, | say, 
would finally take this matter to heart and that we would 
have open eyes for it! For then we would direct our 
attention not to the wickedness of the people, but to the 
root of it. The root of this wickedness is that it does not 
have the word of truth. For how could the people act 
otherwise than wickedly, since they lack the word by 
which one born of God does not sin? Therefore, the 
Scripture rightly holds the shepherds responsible for the 
people's ruin and demands the people from their hands. 

(15) But we excuse ourselves and accuse the people, 
looking at what they do evil by heart, but what is within 
we do not give them, nor do we look at it. That is enough 
of the first part. 

16 Now we must see what the world is. He does not 
speak here of the visible world, which is neither 
conquered nor overcome by faith in Christ; but neither 
will we be able to understand it here of men in the world: 
for who could think that he must overcome men, unless 
he wanted to be a Turk? 

Therefore, the world is actually the evil impulses by 
which Satan rules: the evil works of anger, pride, 
unchastity, avarice, vain honor, and the like, as John 
himself clearly says [1 John 2:16]: "All that is in the world, 
the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the life 
of hope," as if to say that apart from these things there is 
nothing in the world, and it would not be the world if this 
were not so. However, it happens that this visible world 
and men are so called because in the world and in men 


these evil things (pravitates) are found, just as a vessel 


is called instead of what is in it, a city instead of what is 
in it. 


1737 


Citizens. For shameful and wicked citizens also make 
their city a shameful name, as [Matth. 23, 37.]: 
"Jerusalem, whom thou killest that are sent unto thee," 
and elsewhere: Egypt, 1) weep not. Thus the world is 
called evil, and that it contends against us, because our 
impulses, which are in this world, are evil, and contend 
against us. 

It follows that the world is in every man; apart from us 
there is no world. Every man sins, says Jacob [Cap. 1, 
14], in that he is "tempted and enticed by his own lust 
(not by that of another). So Paul says, Titus 2:12: "We 
ought to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts (and worldly 
desires), and to live chastely, righteously, and godly in 
this world." 

19. beauty, riches, fame, honor 2c. are not evil, nor 
do they lead to sin, but rather, since they are good and 
beautiful creatures of God, they uplift and lead us, 
according to their nature, to God. For everything that God 
has made is very good. Therefore, nothing was created 
in this world that was not conducive to good. But the 
wickedness of our desire seeks these things with a 
perverse inclination. He is in truth the world, who by his 
guilt is drawn to evil lust by means of beautiful things, by 
which he should be drawn to chastity; by his guilt he is 
afflicted with adversities and bears sorrow, while by them 
he should be inspired to bravery and to strive for the 
crown of victory, and by all means uses no thing in the 
world in a right way, but abuses all things and by his evil 
use makes a shameful name of the world in which he 
dwells and practices such abuse. 

20 Because we have already been born through the 
word of truth and have been transformed into a new 
creature, a war with this very world arises for us 
immediately, as Peter saws [1 Ep. 2, 11.]: "Abstain from 
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." Again, we also 
contend against the same, as 


1) In the Vulgate it says Gen. 50, 3: "Egypt wept for him [Jacob] 
fifty days".-Here there seems to be an error. We cannot see how the 
quoted word fits here. 


1738 V. a. 1, 37-39. interpretations on the 1st epistle of St. John. W. IX, 2766-2770. 1739 





Gal. 5, 17: "The flesh is aired against the spirit, and the 
spirit against the flesh. The same are against one 
another," and Job 7:1: "The life of man is a strife." 

(21) But here we are especially foolish, because 
under the word "world" we conceive of | do not know 
what kind of thing apart from us, but in the meantime we 
do not pay any attention to our lusts and desires (which 
are the real world), sleep safely, live in peace and say 
with the children of Israel [Jer. 6:14]: "Peace, peace", 
while there is no peace. For we must also let this be 
impressed upon us with no less concern, namely, that 
we are in a constant, exceedingly dangerous and very 
great struggle with these inclinations. So even we have 
forgotten what we also feel every day. Do we not find 
here also many who are more careful how they say 
mass with washed hands, are clothed in splendid 
vestments, sacrifice with pure vessels and cloths, do not 
omit a single syllable of prayer, than how they want to 
resist evil lusts, how they curb unchastity, suppress 
avarice, trample under their feet the ambition 2c., and do 
everything, except that 1) which actually belongs to the 
matter? St. John says: "Everything that is born of God 
overcomes the world", clearly indicating that we are at 
war with the world and that we must overcome. But we 
discuss | don't know what kind of trivial things, these 
serious things rarely come to our mind. 

22. Therefore, it is the other duty of this venerable 


synod, not only to determine among the clergy (in clero) 
with special care what should be read, what should be 
prayed, on what day, what feasts should be celebrated, 
what ceremonies should be used everywhere, but 
rather, rather that care be taken that rules and 
regulations be in place by which evil lusts are kept in 
check, by which they learn and are reminded that they 
are in the line of battle, that their enemies are already in 
their own house, and that they are not safe from them 
by day or by night. 


1) Weimarsche: praeterea instead of: praeter ea. 





so that in the clergy (in clero) of a good bishop the light 
shines before the people in chastity, humility, modesty, 
and the whole register of virtues which Paul lists Tit. 1, 
5. ff. and 1 Tim. 3, 1. ff. 

(23) It is of no avail to leave these matters alone, and 
to take care of some other temporal and spiritual things, 
which concern legal matters, privileges and dignities, 
since these things are there for their sake, but not those 
for their sake. Nor is it fitting for the synod to handle 
minor matters gloriously, but not to touch the most 
important things. All other things are outside of us and 
do not always occupy us, but the evil lusts are in us and 
take us captive continually, as Paul says Rom. 7:23, yes, 
hold many as captives: and here should we find no 
counsel, do nothing, so that these evils may be resisted, 
the soldiers arrayed and the enemies attacked? Then, 
indeed, this world of ours will justly laugh at us and at our 
synod, when it realizes that a synod is assembled 
against it in name only, in appearance only, in place only, 
but that war is not declared against it, nor is war thought 
of. This will be seen in the fruits: 2) It will surely triumph, 
carry off the plunder and distribute it; it will drag this one 
under the tyranny of indulgence, that one under the 
dominion of fornication, it will strike this one in the bonds 
of avarice, that one in the fetters of hatred, and it will 
scatter it among the Assyrians and to all the ends of the 
Babylonian confusion. Then we will see the fruit of a 
hypocritical and fictitious synod, which the Lord in mercy 
will prevent. 

The third is the joyful victory, and what this is, John 
explained. "Our faith," he says, "is the victory that 
overcomes the world." So also Paul says [1 Cor. 15:57], 
"But thanks be to GOD, which hath given us the victory, 
through our Lord JESUS.

Christ!" He has taught us that we are always fighting 
against the world; he has taught us what soldiers are 
worthy of, namely, those who are born of God. But this 
was still lacking, that we should know how to fight in such 
a way that we would gain the victory. For to start a war 
and not to know how to fight and win, that means of 
course nothing else than to be beaten to death and to 
make oneself ridiculous, especially in the face of so 
many, so strong, so clever, so cunning, so well-practiced 
enemies, namely those who are far away from deep- 
rooted evil desires. 

25 What then is the right way to fight? what is the 
certain hope of our victory? "Our faith." So also St. Peter 
teaches [1 Ep. 5:8, 9]: Dear brethren, "Be sober and 
watchful, for your adversary the devil walketh about as a 
roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him 
firmly in the faith." Behold, firmness in faith resisteth the 
devil, as also Isaias Cap. 11, 5. saith, "Righteousness 
shall be the girdle of fine loins, and faith the girdle of his 


kidneys." Behold, faith girds and restrains (restringit) 
loins and kidneys, that is, unchastity, but not unchastity 
alone, but all evil desire in general. 

(26) Therefore, it is clear that those who give in to 
their evil desires and obey lack only faith, which is the 
right armor and armor of God. 

(27) Again, those who presume to overcome their 
vices with human strength and effort are mistaken; they 
often begin, but they fall back again. They cannot be 
overcome other than by faith, and strong faith at that. 
How can this be done? In this way: since faith is a certain 
confidence of things not seen [Heb. 11:1], by which the 
mind is diverted from all things that are seen, and by 
which the evil desires are provoked, and directed toward 
things not seen: if the mind clings to this, it undoubtedly 
tramples under foot all the desires that are provoked by 
visible things. That is why firmness of faith is necessary, 
so that one may be able to keep the 





1741 


| despise the lusts excited by visible things by looking at 
invisible things. 

29 Since this faith is in the heart, Christ is also 
present, in whom one believes through this faith; but 
where Christ is present, everything can be overcome. 
There is no other way of victory that is more effective 
and noble, indeed, this alone is the victory, our faith. For 
then the evil lusts triumph, when by their stirrings they 
have, as it were, clouded and whirled our eyes of faith, 


and have diverted us to the perceptible (tuenda), to the 
visible, so that we forget the invisible, and meanwhile 
are filled with the stimuli of those. 

30 Therefore, although watchfulness, labor, and the 
other labors of bodily exercise are very useful and 
necessary, they are not sufficient to overcome evil 
desire, for though the irritation of the flesh may be 
overcome by them, yet anger, hatred, pride, and 
ambition are not extinguished by them; these are 
overcome by faith alone. 

But because this matter is great and includes many 
things, it is enough to say for this time that faith attains 
what the law commands, as Augustine says, that is, in 
every challenge from our world, faith cries out in the 
heart and calls upon the invisible hand of God, and lifts 
up fine eyes to the mountains from which help comes to 
it. Therefore, because it is not in our power to have faith, 
and therefore not to wage war in a suitable manner, nor 
even to carry off a glorious triumph, the only thing left for 
us is to cry out to the Lord when we are distressed, and 
he will hear us; the victory comes from heaven. Thus it 
shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the 
name of the Lord shall be saved [Joel 3:5]. Only he who 
believes believes; only he who hears the word of truth 
believes; only he who hears the gospel hears the word 
of truth; only he who hears the priest, the angel of God, 
hears the gospel. Therefore, the first and the last thing 
is that we make it our business with all our diligence to 
make the gospel as good as possible.

The Epistle of St. Jude preached and interpreted. *) 


Preached in 1523, printed in 1524. 


The Epistle of St. Jude. 


V. 1. 2. Judas, a servant of Jesus Christ, but a 
brother of Jacob, the called, sanctified in God the 
Father, and kept in Jesus Christ. To you be much 
mercy and peace and love. 


This epistle is dedicated to the holy apostle St. Jude, 
who was the brother of two apostles, Jacob the Less and 
Simonis, brother of the sister of the mother of Christ, who 
is called Mary Jacobi or Cleopheh; as one reads Marc. 
16, 1. But this epistle cannot be considered to be of the 
right apostle, because in it he speaks of the apostles, as 
one of their disciples, long after. It also has nothing 
special in it, except that it points to the other epistle of 
St. Peter, from which it has taken all the words, and is 
nothing other than an epistle against our clergy, bishops, 
priests and monks. 


Dear ones, since I have been diligent to write to 
you about the common salvation, I am compelled to 
write to you and exhort you to continue in the faith 
that was once given to the saints. 

(2) This much is said: | am also compelled to write 
unto you, that | may remind and exhort you how ye ought 
to pass through, continuing in the faith which was 
preached unto you once before. As if he should say: It 


It is necessary that | admonish you to watch and stay on 
the right path. But why it is necessary, he gives a reason 
and says: 


V. 4: For there are some men beside them, of 
whom it was written before, who have come to such 
a judgment. 

(3) Therefore | will remind you to hold fast to the faith 
which you have heard, for there are already preachers 
coming who are teaching other doctrines besides the 
faith, so that people may be led astray cleanly and 
unawares. St. Peter also said in his other 1) Epistle, 
Cap. 2, 1: "There shall be false teachers among you, 
which shall bring in corrupt sects" 2c. These, he says, 
have long since been proclaimed to such a judgment 
that they are damned. 

4 We understand this well, because we know that no 
one becomes righteous and justified by his own works, 
but only by faith in Christ, so that he relies on Christ's 
work as his chief good. After that, if there is faith, 
whatever works a man does afterwards, they should all 
be done for the benefit of the neighbor, and that one 
should beware of all works that are not done in such a 
way that the neighbor is served by them, as there is now 
priestly and

Monasticism. Therefore, if anyone introduces anything 
else of such status and works besides this doctrine of 
faith, he deceives people into being condemned with 
him. 


They are ungodly, and draw the grace of God to 
lust. 


5. The sermon that is given to us of the grace of God, 
and holds Christ up to us, as he is offered and given to 
us with all that he has, that we may be free from sin, 
death, and all misfortune; Such grace and gift, offered by 
the gospel, they use to drive only their lust, that is, they 
call themselves Christians, and pretend the gospel, but 
lead beside it such a state, in which they drive all 
courageousness in eating and drinking and evil living; as 
they boast and say: We are not in the worldly, but in the 
spiritual state; and under such a name and appearance 
have taken all good, honor and pleasure. This already 
begins, says Jude. For we read that it began a thousand 
years ago that the bishops wanted to be lords and to be 
held higher than the common Christians; as can also be 
seen in St. Jerome's Epistles. 


And deny God that He alone is the Lord, and the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 


6 St. Peter also said this in his epistle; but the denial 
(as we have heard) is not done with the mouth, for with 
it they confess that God is a Lord; but they deny the Lord 
Christ with deeds and works, do not consider Him to be 
their Lord, but themselves. For when they preach that 
fasting, pilgrimage, church planting, chastity, obedience, 
poverty, etc. are the way to salvation, they lead people 
to their works, and keep silent about Christ, and this is 
just as much as if they said, "Christ is of no use to you, 
His works" do not help you, but you must earn salvation 
with your own works. So they deny the Lord who bought 
us with his blood, as Peter says. 


V. 5-7. But I want to remind you that you know this 
all at once, that the Lord, when he 


Sermon on Jude 4-8. 


W. IX, 1323-1326. 1745 
The first time he helped the people out of Egypt, the 
second time he killed those who did not believe. Also 
the angels, who did not keep their principality, but 
left their dwelling, he kept for the judgment of the 
great day, with everlasting bands under the 
darkness. Just as Sodoma and Gomorrah, and the 
cities around them, which also went out in the same 
way as these, and went after another flesh, are set as 
an example, and bear the eternal fire. 


(7) He also gives three examples, like St. Peter in his 
epistle. But of those he adds one, as God caused the 
children of Israel, whom he had brought out of Egypt by 
many miraculous signs, when they believed not, to 
perish and to be slain, that there remained no more than 
two of them, though they were numbered of all that 
came out, from twenty years old and upward, even six 
times an hundred thousand men. Now he sets these 
examples as a warning and a fright, as if he should say 
that those who are called Christians should beware, and 
under that name draw on the grace of God for lust, so 
that it does not happen to them as it happened to those 
1). And indeed, since the time the papacy went out, and 
the gospel was concealed in the whole world, there has 
always come one plague after another, so that God has 
punished the unbelievers and thrown them into the 
devil's jaws. 


v.s These dreamers who defile the flesh are like 
them. 


8 He calls these teachers "dreamers. For just as 
when a man lies in a dream, so he goes about with 
images, and thinks he has something; but when he 
wakes up, there is nothing there. Then he sees that it 
was a dream and does not give anything to it. So also 
what these say is nothing else but a mere dream; but 
when their eyes will once be opened, they will see that 
it is nothing. So when they see that their plates and 
caps, obedience, poverty and chastity are pleasing to 
God, they have this before their eyes, and before God it 
is nothing but a mere dream. So he has given them a 
right, fine

1747 





Names given that they deal with dreams, so that they 
deceive themselves and the world. 

(9) But the apostles especially give this vice to the 
spiritual class, that they lead an unchaste life. God also 
proclaimed long before that they would have no wives. 
Now it is not possible 1) for God to do as many 
miraculous works as there are people in the state; 
therefore they cannot be chaste. Thus the prophet 
Daniel Cap. 12, 37. said of the Pabst's regiment: "He will 
not respect wives." This is an outward virtue, as it is 
inward, that they are dreamers. 


But the lords despise, and the majesties 
blaspheme. 


The third virtue is that they do not want to be subject 
to worldly authority. Thus we have taught: While we live 
on earth, we are all obliged to be subject and obedient 
to the authorities. For the Christian faith does not break 
the secular rule; therefore no one can pull himself out of 
it. Therefore, the pope's decree of the church's liberties 
is the devil's law. 


V. 9. But Michael the archangel, when he 
quarreled with the devil, and talked over the body of 
Moses, could not pronounce the sentence of 
blasphemy, but said, ''The Lord punish you. 


(11) This is one of the reasons why this epistle was 
rejected before, because an example is given here that 
is not in the Scriptures, how the angel Michael and the 
devil quarreled with each other about Moses' body. This 
is said to have happened because so much is written 
about Moses, Deut. 34, 6, how God buried him and no 
one has yet learned of his grave; also because the 
Scriptures bear witness, v. 10, that no prophet in Israel 
rose again like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face 
2c. So it is said about the same text that his body was 
kept hidden so that the Jews would not set up idolatry 
with it. And that is why the angel Michael resisted the 
devil who wanted the body to be hidden. 


1) Jenaer in the text: "impossible" with the conjecture "possible" 
in the margin. 





would be revealed that the Jews should worship him. 
And although Michael was an archangel (says Jude), yet 
he was not so bold as to curse the devil himself; and 
these blasphemers trample under foot the authority 
ordained by God, cursing it to the seventh, eighth and 
ninth generation, if they are men, so that this archangel 
should not have maledicted the worst devil, who is 
already damned, but says no more, but: "The Lord forbid 
thee, and punish thee.” 


V.10. But these, what they do not know, they 
blaspheme; but what they naturally know, like 
unreasoning animals, therein they corrupt 
themselves. 


(12) They are such blasphemers that they can do 
nothing but banish and curse and give them to the devil, 
not only kings and majesties, but also God and the 


saints, as is seen in the bulla coenae Domini. They do 
not know that our salvation is based on faith and love, 
and they cannot suffer their works to be rejected and 
condemned, and preach how Christ alone must help us 
with his works. Therefore they banish and blaspheme all 
Christian doctrine, which they do not know; but that 
which they know by natural knowledge, namely, that 
making masses and the like brings money and goods, 
they force themselves into it, and thereby corrupt 
themselves and everyone. 


V. 11 Woe to them, for they have gone the way of 
Cain. 


13 Cain slew his brother only because he was more 
pious than he; for that sacrifice was acceptable in the 
sight of God, but his was not, Genesis 4:4, 8. Now this 
is "the way of Cain," to stand on one's own works and to 
blaspheme right works, and to kill and strangle those 
who walk in the right way, as these also do. 


And are buried by the wages in the error of 
Balaam. 


14. they should remain inwardly in confidence of 
divine grace, but they go out and scatter to and fro in 
various outward works, and do it only for the sake of 
money, that they may fill their bellies, as the prophet 
Balaam, when we heard in the epistle of Peter, 2 Pet. 2, 
15. 


1748 


Eri. 52, 278-280. 


And perished in the turmoil of Korah. 


(15) Of the rebellion of Korah, and how he perished 
with his company, is written in the fourth book of Moses, 
chapter 16. Moses was required and appointed by God 
to lead the people out of Egypt, and his brother Aaron 
was also appointed by God to be the chief priest. Now 
Korah was also of the same family and their friendship, 
who also wanted to be something great and to be 
brought forth, and attached to himself two hundred and 
fifty men from the best and most distinguished of the 
people, and caused such an outrage and tumult that 
Moses and Aaron had to flee. And Moses fell on his face 
and prayed that God would not accept their sacrifice, 
and commanded the congregation of the people to 
depart from them, and said to them, v. 28 ff: "In this you 
shall know that the LORD has sent me: If these die or 
are afflicted, as all men are afflicted, the LORD hath not 
sent me. But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and 
the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, 
and they shall go down alive into hell; then ye shall know 
that these men have blasphemed the LORD. When he 
had spoken these words, the earth cracked open 
beneath them and swallowed up Korah and the other 
heads of the rebellion with everything they had, so that 
they went down to hell alive. And the fire devoured the 
other two hundred and fifty men who had joined him." 

(16) Now Judas points this example to these 
blasphemers, who blame us for causing trouble when we 
preach against them, when they are the ones who cause 
all the trouble. For Christ is our Aaron and chief priest, 
whom we ought to let reign alone. But the pope and the 
bishops 1) do not want to suffer this, they have raised 
themselves up, and want to rule by force, and set 
themselves against Christ. God has punished them for 
having swallowed up and covered the earth, for being 
drowned and swallowed up in earthly life and pleasures, 
and for being nothing but the world.

Sermon on Jude 11-13.

v.12.13. These live on your love's goods, and are the 
filth, and feed well, without care, feeding themselves. 
Clouds without water, driven about by the wind, 
bare, barren trees, twice dead and rooted out. Wild 
waves of the sea, foaming their own shame, erring 
stars, which are kept in the darkness of eternity. 


(17) We have heard enough of this in St. Peter's 
epistle. All the world has brought up its children to be 
clergymen and to have good days, and not to feed 
themselves with their hands and their labor, nor even to 
preach, but to live in ease without care, and to have good 
courage from the goods that poor people acquire by their 
sweat. Item, one means, they should be the best piece 
and jewel in the Christianity, then they are vain stains 
and abominations; "eat well", as one also speaks: What 
is good belongs to the clergy; they are without care and 
fear, thinking that the devil may not overthrow them; they 
do not feed the sheep, but are themselves wolves that 
devour the sheep; they are the "clouds" that hover above 
in the air, sitting up in the church as if they should 
preach, and yet they do not preach, but let themselves 
be driven to and fro by the devil. 

18. item, they are "bare, unfruitful trees" (he says) as 
the autumn trees, have neither fruit nor leaves; stand 
alone, as other trees; let themselves be seen as 
Christian bishops, but neither word nor works is there, 
but everything has died with the root. 

19) Further, they are like the "wild waves of the sea," 
that is, as the wind on the water casts and drives the 
waves and bulges, so they also go as the devil leads 
them; and "foam out their own shame," like a pot 2) full 
of heat; are so full of excess that they go over the top 
and can keep nothing with them, but must all come out. 

20) They are "erroneous stars", as the planets are 
called, which go backward, and not in a steady, straight 
3) course. Thus they also have no right course, their life 
and teaching is vain error, in which they deceive 
themselves, and

all who follow them. Therefore, "darkness is kept for them 
for eternity. 

(21) Jude has thus praised and depicted our spiritual 
rulers, who, under the name of Christ and Christianity, 
introduce all evil, and seize all the goods of the world, and 
bring everyone under themselves by force. Now follow 
on: 


V.14. 15. Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also 
foretold of these, saying, Behold, the Lord has come 
with many thousands of saints to execute judgment on 
everyone. 

22 This saying of Enoch is also nowhere read in the 
Scriptures, therefore some fathers did not accept this 
epistle. Although it is not strong enough that one should 
reject a book for its sake. For also St. Paul 2 Tim. 3, 8. 
names two opponents of Moses, Jannes and Jambres, 
which names are also not found in Scripture. But be it as 
it may, we will let it pass; but this is nevertheless true, that 
from the beginning of the world God has always had His 
word (which promises His grace and salvation to the 
faithful, but judgment and condemnation to the unfaithful) 
proclaimed to some, until after Christ's ascension; since 
then it has been publicly preached in all the world. But 
before Christ's birth, God took only one line before Him 
from Adam to Abraham, and from there on to David, until 
Mariam, Christ's mother, who had God's word. So the 
Gospel has always been preached in the world, but never 
so publicly as now, at the last time. 

23 Thus this father Enoch also practiced the word of 
God, which he undoubtedly learned from his father 
Adam, and had from the Holy Spirit. For the Scripture 
says of him, Genesis 5:24, that he led a godly life and 
was therefore taken away from God, so that he was no 
longer seen. Therefore it is also said that he should return 
before the last day. But it is not to be waited for; let it be 
understood that he should come spiritually, namely, that 
his sermon rhymes with the last day. How then this 
saying rhymes, wherein he is so spoken. 


1751 


He speaks of the last day as if he already has it before 
his eyes. "The Lord has already come (he says) with 
many thousands of saints," that is, with such a multitude 
as cannot be counted. For this alone must be said of the 
last day, in which he will come with all the saints to 
execute judgment. For he did not come before with many 
thousands of saints, but came alone into the world, not 
to judge, but to give grace. 


And to punish all their ungodly, for all the works 
of their ungodly ways, so that they have been 
ungodly. 

(24) Judas does not reject this saying, that he speaks 
of false teachers who are to come before the last day, 
and also wants to agree that the Lord with his future will 
destroy the pope with his regiment; there is no other help 
for it. For because the world stands, there can be no end 
nor improvement to it. It cannot be understood in this 
way by anyone else, except by our clergy, who have 
miserably deceived the whole world, because it cannot 
become worse. And even if it became worse, it would 
still have to keep the name of Christ, and under that 
name it would raise up all misery. So he refers this 
saying to the last judgment and names those who will be 
judged. Therefore we conclude that our spiritual young 
men must wait for the last day, be it long or short. 


And for all the hard things which ungodly sinners 
have spoken against him. 


(25) Then he meets both their life and their preaching, 
saying, They speak strongly and harshly against the 
Lord who is to come, they are insolent and proud, they 
mock and blaspheme him, as St. Peter said. He does 
not say of their sinful, shameful life, but of the ungodly 
nature. "Ungodly," however, is he who lives without faith, 
though he already leads an honorable, outward life. 
Outward evil works may be the fruits of unbelief, but they 
are actually called ungodly beings, who look pretty on 
the outside, but their hearts are full of unbelief. The Lord 
will punish the same wicked because their preaching is 
insolent and stiff-necked. For they remain always on 


1752 Erl. 52, 283-285. 
Their head cannot be steered, and they are as hard as 
an anvil, condemning and lusting for and for. So Enoch 
has in this saying just the state troffen, which should be 
before the last day in the world, as one sees now before 
eyes. Further Judas says: 


V. 16: They are murmurers and complainers 1) 
who walk according to their lusts, and their mouth 
speaks pompous words. 

(26) If they will not let their thing be right and just, 
there is vain murmuring and complaining. So, if one 
does not give a bishop a right title, they cry about 
disobedience. In addition it is such a people, which is not 
to be resisted. For they pretend to have right over body 
and soul, they have taken both worldly and spiritual 
swords to themselves, so that they cannot be forced. So 
one must not preach against them. They have stripped 
themselves of all their property, interest and pensions, 
so that their goods may not be touched. No one is 
allowed to preach a word to them, unless they are asked 
first; and if they are attacked with the Scriptures, they 
say, "You must leave them alone to interpret the 
Scriptures. So they live everywhere as they please, 
according to their lusts. For they cannot apply this to us 
as they would like, since we have both submitted to the 
gospel and the secular sword; but they want to be free 
and unconstrained by both. Item, about it their whole law 
and right is nothing, because full, full vain high, proud, 
pompous words, since nothing is behind it. 


And hold themselves after the reputation, for the 
sake of benefit. 


27 This is their way, that they judge everything 
according to the person. In all the Pabst laws through 
and through you will not find once that a bishop should 
humble himself under a parish priest, or that he should 
meet any fruit of a Christian being; but everything is thus: 
The chaplain should be under the parish priest, the 
parish priest under the bishop, the bishop under the 
archbishop, and the latter under the patriarch, the 
patriarch under the pope. And after that, as each one 
shall have clothing, plates

Sermon on Jude 15-19, 





W. IX, 1334-1337. 1753 

And they have worn their caps, and have had so many 
churches and benefices. So they have drawn it all on 
external beings, and have done such child's play and 
fool's work, and considered it a great sin if anyone did not 
keep it. That is why Jude says that they put all their things 
on the larvae and have only that in mind. No one knows 
anything about faith, love or the cross. In this way the 
common man is deceived and fooled, and turns all his 
goods to the right service of God; that is, they keep 
themselves according to reputation, for the sake of gain. 


But you, beloved, remember the words spoken 
before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, when 
they told you that in the last days there will be scoffers 
who walk according to their own lusts of the ungodly 
nature. 


28 This saying also indicates that this epistle is not St. 
Jude the Apostle, for he does not count himself among 
the other apostles, but speaks of them as of those who 
preached long before him; so that it is reasonable to think 
that the epistle was written by another pious man who 
read St. Peter's epistle and drew these sayings from it. 

29) Who the "scoffers" are, we have said above, in 
addition also "those who walk according to their own 
lusts", not only according to the 2) carnal, but "of the 
godless nature", which they lead, and do everything as it 
pleases them, respect neither the worldly power nor the 
word of God, are also neither in the outward nor inward 
regiment, neither divine nor human, hover between 
heaven and earth in the air, as the devil leads them. 


V.19. These are the ones who make sects, sensual 
ones who have no spirit. 


(30) Then he has understood what Peter says in 2 Ep 
2:1, how they introduce corrupt sects. For they are the 
ones who have separated themselves to separate unity 
in the faith, not wanting to let the common Christian state 
be enough, where one serves the other, but set up other 
states, pretending to be God's servants.

to serve with it. They are sensual or animalistic people, 
who have no more intellect and spirit than a horse or 
donkey, who go about according to their natural intellect 
and carnal sense, having no word of God to judge 
themselves by or to live by. 


V. 20. 21. But you, my beloved, build yourselves up 
on our most holy faith, through the Holy Spirit, and 
pray. And keep yourselves in the love of God. 


There he summarizes in short words what a 
completely Christian being is. Faith is the foundation on 
which one should build. But "building" is to increase day 
by day in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, 
which is done by the Holy Spirit. When we have been built 
up in this way, we should not do any work to earn 
anything by it and to become blessed, but should do 
everything for the benefit of our neighbor. Then we must 
see to it that we abide in love, and do not fall out as fools, 
who set up strange works and creatures, and so lead 
men away from love. 


And wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ 
for eternal life. 


This is the hope of the holy cross; therefore our life 
should be set up in such a way that it is nothing else but 
a constant longing and waiting for the life to come, but in 
such a way that such waiting is directed to the mercy of 
Christ, that we call upon him in such a way that he helps 
us from this life to that life out of pure mercy, not through 
any work or merit. 


V. 22. 23. And have mercy on these and set them 
apart. But these make blessed [with fear], 2) and bring 
them out of the fire. 


1) Jenaer and Erlanger: "vieheliche". 

2) The words "mit Furcht" (with fear), which are missing in the Jena 
and Erlangen editions, are probably omitted here only by an oversight, 
because they are placed later in the interpretation. 





33) This is not well said in German, but it means this 
much: 3) Have mercy on some, make some blessed; 
that is, let your lives be directed toward mourning for 
those who are miserable, blind and hardened, have no 
joy or pleasure in them; but let them go, get rid of them, 
and have nothing to do with them. But the others, whom 
you can pull out, "make blessed with fear," deal kindly 
and gently with them, as God dealt with you, do not act 
with violence and storms, but stand against them as 
against those lying in the fire, whom you are to pull out 
and save with all care, reason and diligence. If they do 
not want to be pulled out, let them go and have mercy 
on them; do not, like the pope and the heretics, burn 
them with fire and strangle them. 


And hate the stained skirt of the flesh. 


(34) We have received the Holy Spirit through faith 
and have been cleansed, but as long as we live here, 
the old sackcloth, our flesh and blood, is still clinging to 
us, which does not leave its will. This is the stained robe 
that we are to take off and always take off as long as we 
live. 


V. 24, 25: Now to Him who is able to keep you 
without offense, and to set you before the face of His 
glory blameless with joy, to God, who alone is wise, 
to our Savior, be glory and majesty, and kingdom 
and power, now and forever. Amen. 


35 This is the conclusion of this epistle. Thus do the 
apostles: When they have written, taught, exhorted and 
prophesied, they ask, desire and give thanks. So we 
have now seen in these 4) epistles both what is true 
Christian and false unchristian teaching and life.

throughout this scripture, the beginning of this paragraph is changed:

Preface by Georg Rorer. 


To the most noble Prince and Lord, Lord Albrecht, 
Margrave of Brandenburg, Duke of Prussia, of Stettin 
in Pomerania 2c. and Burgrave of Nuremberg 2c. 2c., 
Georgius Rorarius wishes God's grace, through our 
Savior, Jesus Christ. 

It is highly deplorable that we wretched people consider 
so little the wonderful counsel of God, and the great grace 
and blessing, namely that God has revealed Himself so 
often and with clear testimonies to the human race from the 
beginning, and do not want to think that we owe it to 
ourselves to listen to this high majesty, which presents its 
special secrecy to us. 

If a faithful, well-learned schoolmaster gave a good, 
useful lesson at a certain hour every day, and the students 
always left it, did not want to listen, and mocked him for it, 
that would be a great, high and noble misdeed. 

Now God is not much different in the human race. He is 
so gracious and merciful, and thirsts for our blessedness, 
as is clear from 


his hidden throne, speaks to us with certain testimonies, and 
makes us proclaim his promise of the forgiveness of sins, 
and of eternal life, which is above all creature understanding 
and wisdom. 

Nevertheless, the people run away like the wicked 
disciples, do not want to do so much honor to this high and 
most most important and most faithful schoolmaster that 
they listen to him; they mock him and consider his voice and 
teaching to be fables 2c. This great, terrible ingratitude and 
dishonor against God should be considered and deplored 
by the God-fearing, who should admonish themselves to 
listen to this schoolmaster with greater seriousness, to look 
at his prescribed teachings, and to read them. 

But the fact that many do not respect this is mainly due 
to this blindness, that they think they are wise themselves 
and know what is right, even though they do not read the 
sermons of the peasants, which are written by prophets and 
apostles. 

For it is in human reason a piece- 





*It find the two main collections of Luther's Bible inscriptions and interpretations of sayings organized and edited by Aurifaber and von 
Rorer. The first edition by Johannes Aurifaber appeared without indication of place and time under the title: "Auslegung etzlicher 
Trostspriiche, so der ehrwirdige Herr, Doctor Martinus Luther, in seiner lieben Herren und guten Freunden Bibeln und Postillen mit eigener 
Hand (zu seinem Gedachtnisnif) geschrieben." This edition is provided with a letter from Aurifaber to the Count of Mansfeld, Volrath, dated 
"Erfurt on the 4th day Februarii 1547". This collection contains only the interpretations written by Luther himself, but not arranged according 
to the biblical books. Georg Rérer's collection is entitled: "Vieler schéne Spriiche aus g6ttlicher Schrift Auslegung, daraus Lehre und Trost 
zu nehmen, welche der ehrwirdige Herr Doct. Luther wrote in their Bibles. Such sayings, interpreted by other gentlemen, are also included. 
Wittenberg 1547." At the end: "Printed at Wittemberg by Hans Lufft." A second edition of this edition was published in 1549 by Hans Lufft, 
whose title was given the addition: "Mit Flei wiederum durchsehen und gemehret." This edition also contains interpretations by Melanchthon, 
Jonas, Creutziger, Bugenhagen, Georg Major, and Amsdorf. Later editions are that of Burkhardt Keller, Strasbourg 1621, and that of Emil 
Ohly at Frankfurt a. M. 1852. In the collective editions: Wittenberger, vol. IX, p. 480 (according to the Rérer edition with the letter to Margrave 
Albrecht of Brandenburg, dated August 21, 1547, which we reproduce here); Jenaer (1558), vol. VIII, p. 309; Altenburger, vol. VIII, p. 531; 
Leipziger, vol. XII, p. 96 and in the Erlanger, vol. 52, p. 287. The Jenaer and the following collections contain only Luther's interpretations. 
We base Mar on the Wittenberg edition, but leave out everything that is not by Luther himself, except the preface of Rérer. The "short 
explanations" of three sayings, which are printed separately from the others by Walch at the end of this writing, we have inserted at the 
appropriate place. 


1758 


The only part of divine doctrine is the doctrine of the law, or 
the doctrine of outward discipline 2c. Because these worldly 
wise men think that this piece alone is the whole divine 
wisdom, and they know this piece by natural understanding, 
they despise the prophets' and apostles' Scriptures, do not 
read them, and thus remain in blindness, like the pagans. 

| have also known a doctor in theology who spoke: If the 
books of the prophets and apostles were lost, the Church of 
God could be sufficiently taught and governed from the book 
Ethicorum Aristotelis. These are truly terrible and 
blasphemous words, and publicly prove that at that time the 
difference between the doctrine of the Law and the Gospel, 
or the promise of forgiveness of sins, was very obscure. 

In order for us to understand correctly what divine 
teaching is, and what the divine secret counsel is that is 
above and beyond all angels and men's wisdom, which God 
has written through the prophets and apostles, we should 
always bear the difference between the teaching of the Law 
and the Gospel in our hearts, and we should not forget it, 
that this wisdom, that God will be gracious to us for the sake 
of His Son, that He will surely hear us and give us eternal 
blessedness, that He will also govern us in this life, and that 
He will help us in all our needs according to His counsel, 
cannot be taught to me in any other way than by reading or 
listening to the books of the prophets and apostles. 

By this writing and preaching God wants to be known and 
to be powerful. Yes, when you begin to pray, you should 
remember this true God, who gave and commanded this 
teaching and word of His to the prophets and apostles, and 
gave certain testimonies to it with the raising of the dead and 
other miraculous works. 

For in this life we cannot look at God or grasp Him in any 
other way than through His Word, so that He Himself may 
touch our hearts and work in us a light and comfort, in which, 
contemplating His speeches, we may look at Him and grasp 
Him in faith. 

The human heart would like to see God with the eyes of 
the flesh and embrace Him with the arms, as the apostle 
says: "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied. 
John 14:8 But our Savior reproves these thoughts, and 
directs us from sight to word, saying to Thomas, "Blessed 
are they that believe, though they have not seen." But faith 
depends on the word, which must be read, heard and 
contemplated. 

Therefore, it is necessary to read the writings of the 
prophets and apostles. To which the Holy Spirit also

1759 


Spirit so often points out. As Rom. 15:4: "That which is 
written is prescribed for our learning, that we through 
patience have hope through comfort of the Scriptures." 

These words are strange among the world's tits. If 
Laurentius lies on the grate, what comfort can he have in the 
letters and syllables? If God took him alive out of the fire, 
this would be called a consolation. But Laurentius knows, if 
he himself holds these words before him: "Come to me, all 
you who are in distress, and | will refresh you,” Matth. 11, 
28, and if he concludes that these words are certainly true, 
that God's Son is with him and wants to make him blessed, 
and thus is satisfied in God through these words, then he 
certainly feels eternal comfort. This must be learned by 
experience. 

To this also belongs this saying Rom. 1, 17: "The 
righteous lives by faith. If the heart is to have and receive 
comfort through faith, it must cling to divine, clear sayings 
and straighten itself up on them, as a sick person straightens 
himself on a pole. That is why the Psalm says: Lucerna 
pedibus meis verbum tuum: "Your word is a light to my feet," Ps. 
119, 105. 

And Paul exhorts Timothy 1 Ep. 4, 13. "Stop reading, 
comforting and teaching." He sums up three pieces, like a 
very understanding preacher. First, he says of reading, so 
that he may point us to this certain Scripture that God has 
prescribed for us through the prophets and apostles. As if 
he wanted to say: You should not invent your own fantasies 
if you want to teach yourself or others about God's nature or 
will, or comfort yourself or others. Only from this fountain 
one should draw teaching and comfort; therefore one must 
stop reading. 

Whoever is so proud that he thinks it is enough once he 
has gone through the Bible, does not understand how God 
works with His words. Our hearts are daily challenged; 
therefore they need daily new admonition and new 
consolation. And does God give more light and comfort to 
the heart for and for, wanting us not to become lazy or 
proud, but to read and consider His Word for and for. 
Therefore Paul says, "Stop reading." 

For this purpose, it is very useful to have many special, 
noble, exquisite sayings in fresh memory at all times, which 
soon remind, instruct, admonish or comfort us. How these 
sayings have often strengthened and comforted me, so that 
| have firmly decided with myself that God knows my misery 
and sorrow, and will not let me sink, namely: "All the hairs 
on your head will be cut off. 


1760 Eri. [s, 28s. Interpretation of many beautiful sayings. W. ix, 1345-1348. 


Head find gezahlet", Matth. 10, 30. Item: "No one will snatch 
my sheep out of my hands" 2c., Joh. 10, 38. 

Therefore, many such short sayings are collected in this 
booklet, together with the interpretation of the venerable Mr. 
Martin Luther blessed, and some others. 1) And although 
this work seems small, the benefit is not small, who wants 
to strengthen his faith with reading. As it was said before, 
God's serious command is that one should read and learn 
His Scriptures. So these short interpretations, in which the 
natural juice of the sayings is captured, give more 
understanding than many great old commentarii Origenis, or 
many others. 

And | wanted to ascribe this work to E. F. G.'s humble 
and Christian opinion, because you know that Christian 
teachings are not fables, but unchangeable truth, and that 
God certainly accepts us, hears us, and wants to give us 
eternal bliss, as He has revealed in the Gospel, esteeming 
these divine promises higher than all treasures, all 
kingdoms, and all goods and pleasures on earth. Nor do we 
have any greater joy on earth than to contemplate the 
beautiful life to come, when we shall dwell with God His Son, 
with Adam, Noah, Abraham, David and other fathers, 
prophets and apostles, even with many of our dear parents 
and many good friends, in eternal wisdom and 
righteousness, and that this mortal life will be a life of peace. 


1) We have omitted the interpretations that are from others. 


From the fifth book of Moses. 
Cap. 4, 2. (1544.) 2) 

You shall not do anything to it that I command 
you, nor shall you do anything to it. 

Behold, nothing shall be done to it, nor of that which 
Moses commanded. And the pope wants to do from and 
to what Christ the Lord himself has ordered. O furious 
and foolish people! Moses says: "That you may keep the 
commandments of the Lord" 2c. That is, one cannot 
keep God's commandment where one wants to serve 
God with human doctrine. Is this not said clearly 
enough?

Probably Walch inserted the same after Aurifaber. 





1761 


Life alone is a short preparation, like a children's school, for 
the other life. 

Therefore, E. F. G. is also doing great diligence to plant 
the studia, so that many people will be instructed in this 
children's school for their salvation. In addition, the almighty, 
eternal God, Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has 
revealed Himself with such certain testimonies that there is 
no doubt about His teachings, and wants us to ask Him for 
grace, wisdom, righteousness, life, relief from our misery, 
and eternal blessedness, may strengthen, preserve, and 
protect the Foundation for a long time against all enemies. 
May E. F. G. in all sorrow, for the sake of His Son JEsu 
Christ, comfort us with His Holy Spirit, Amen. Date 
Wittenberg, Anno 1547, on the 21st day of August, on which 
the church commemorates how the holy, excellent man, 
"John Baptist", whom God especially called to the ministry 
of preaching and adorned with high gifts, was murdered to 
please the unfaithful adulteress. So that we may be 
reminded that the Christian Church is placed under the 
Cross, and that God will certainly place her in eternal honor 
afterwards. 

This is proven by the death of John. For since God so 
clearly testified to John earlier that he had called him and 
was merciful to him, and the tyrant now unjustly murdered 
him, God has not forgotten him and will hereafter be the 
judge between the tyrant and John. With such examples 
God wants us to strengthen ourselves in the right faith. For 
this purpose, may He grant us His grace. Amen. 


Cap. 8, 10. 


And when thou hast eaten, and art full, that thou 
mayest praise the LORD thy God for the good land 
which he hath given thee. 

Let this also be said to us, who are called and are 
Christians, that we also want to be held responsible for 
receiving the gifts from God Almighty with reverence and 
thanksgiving, and not to go to the table like swine to the 
trough, and again to run from the table when we have 
filled ourselves, not to thank our dear God with the 
slightest prayer or sigh, yes, never to remember our 
Lord God, who fed us ingrates out of pure mercy and 
mild kindness. So we forget our dear God, who gives us 
all kinds of rich things to enjoy.

Cap. 32, 2. 3. ') From the Psalter. 
Let my teaching drip like the rain, and my speech Psalm 1, 1. (1543.)° ) 


flow like the dew, like the rain on the grass, and like 
the drops on the herb. For I will praise the name of 
the Lord. 


Here Moses himself gives the gloss on his books, 
whereof he teaches and speaks, namely, he wants to 
prophesy 2) about the name of Messiah, Jesus 
Christ, who is certainly the Lord, with God the Father 
and the Holy Spirit. 'For all things pertain to the Son, 
even the Levitical priesthood, which he himself calls 
an image of the, future Christ, 2 Mof. 25, 40. "See that 
thou make it in their image, which thou sawest in the 
mount." Therefore, the New Testament flowed and 
fell from Moses, like the rain from the clouds and the 
dew from heaven. Also before 3) all the prophets 
have it from Moses. 1544. 

Martinus Luther, D. 


From the Book of Joshua. 
Cap. 1, 8. *) 
Do not let the book of this law come out of your 
mouth. 


This is a glorious promise to him who loves to walk, 
to study the Bible, and to be diligent in it. Namely, he 
shall be happy and be able to drive wisely. 


From the 2nd Book of Samuel. 
Cap. 23, 2.5) 
The Spirit of the Lord has spoken through me, and 
his speech has been through my tongue. 


And if only the Son of Messiah, man and David's 
son is born, no other angel or man can understand 
the saying: Hebr. 1, 5: "To which angel did he ever 
say: You are my son, today | have begotten you"? 
Crede, et salvus eris.

Blessed is he who walks not in the counsel of the 
wicked, nor treads in the way of sinners, nor sits 
where scoffers sit. 


A hard, noticeable word is that apart from God's 
word all teachings of men are so utterly condemned 
that they are called the counsel of the wicked, the 
way of sinners, the seat of scoffers, and God does 
not want to know anything about them, they are also 
chaff that the wind weaves, although counsel, way, 
seat, are beautiful, glorious names, and shine, for the 
seduction of the world, and are also called God's 
service, Matth. 15, 8. 9. from Isaiah 29, 13.: "In vain 
do they serve me with the commandments of men; 
their heart is far from me." 


Blessed is he who does not walk in the counsel of the 
wicked 2c. 


This is just as if there were few on earth who did 
not walk in the counsel of the wicked. Now no one 
wants to be a sinner, nor to do wrong; where then do 
the wicked, and so many of them, come from? It is 
the cause, he says, they call it counsel, prudence, 
wisdom, right and good, all that they do, no one shall 
call it otherwise nor punish it. So it goes according to 
the proverb: 

Everybody likes his way, that's why the world is 
full of fools. 

Thus the earth is full of saints; only heaven must 
be full of sinners. Summa, only God's Son and His 
own must be sinners, the devil and his world is holy, 
and walks in vain counsel, holiness and wisdom; so 
it goes, so it must go. But it will end badly at last, if 
the end of this psalm will also come: "The Lord knows 
the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked 
perishes. 


(1545.) 
Blessed is he who walks not in the counsel of the 
wicked, nor treads in the way of sinners, nor sits 
where scoffers sit, but delights in the law of the 
LORD, and speaks of his law day and night. ’)

This is said not only of evil living, but much more 
of false teaching, from which no good work can 
come, even though it seems very good. Therefore the 
prophet warns that if anyone wants to become pious, 
do good and be saved, he should beware of all false 
teaching, and keep diligently to the word of God 
alone, and he will be safe. 

Martinus Lutherus, D. 


(1546.)' ) 


Blessed is he who delights in the law of the Lord 
and writes in his law daily. 


It is true that in this life we are sought and 
entangled by the devil without ceasing. In addition, 
the world tempts and draws us to itself without 
ceasing. Thus, without this, our own flesh is lazy and 
sleepy for God's service. These three enemies do not 
let us rest, each one of them is drawing us to his own 
way, so that we should forget about God. Against 
them we have nothing else but God's word, so that 
we may defend ourselves and practice right faith 
against such powerful three enemies. But God says 
that "it shall be well with us" and that we shall have 
happiness if we diligently read, hear, speak, and 
keep His word, that is, if we win by the word, amen. 


Blessed is he who walks not 2c. 


Nota: The ungodly doctrine and life he calls 
advice and ways, if it is yet vain ungodly and sinful 
thing. It seems and glitters well as a delicious advice 
and way; but because it is not God's word, but own 
beautiful conceit, everything is lost and condemned, 
with masters and disciples. 


In lege Domini voluntas ejus. 


Ejus is the new man in Christ; without and apart 
from Christ the old Adam hates the law. But what he 
does not like to do, he does half of it, where he is 
forced; where he is not forced, but does it for reward 
and enjoyment, he does it wrongly; where he can be 
free, he does the contradiction. So does the world, 
that is, all men by nature. Of this one must

consider. Whoever lives in the world and among 
people will not see, hear, or experience anything 
else. The rhyme of the world is not: In lege Domini 
voluntas ejus; but: In lege Domini odium vel simulatio ejus, 
there adjust yourself, and learn patientiam. 


Blessed is he who delights in the law of the Lord. ”) 

Yes, of course, there must be desire to do what 
one is supposed to do, even in external matters,” and 
then it will happen. But where there is unwillingness 
and unwillingness, things go as they may, not as they 
ought. Much less will it work in the way of salvation, 
where the devil hinders and persecutes without 
ceasing, where God's word is not accepted and kept 
with joy and love against all deceit and violence of 
Satan, the world and the flesh. 

The righteous delight in the word of God, and 
gladly speak of it day and night; therefore they can do 
all things, do all things, and remain green and fruitful 
forever, like a palm tree by the water. 

The wicked have pleasure in their God, belly and 
mammon, therefore they can also nothing, do 
nothing, do not remain, but perish, like a shadow, with 
all their good, honor, doing, power, belly, mammon. 
For the word of God abides forever, and all who abide 
in it with lust and love, amen. 


(1544.)° ) 
V. 6 The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but 


the way of the wicked perishes. 

Righteous is called, and can be called nothing 
else from the beginning of the world, than he who 
believes in the seed of the woman, the seed of 
Abraha, the seed of David, the son of Mary the Virgin, 
who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who died for us 
and rose from the dead. The way, nature, life and 
death of such righteous or faithful ones is known to 
God and pleases Him for eternity. But the wicked, 
that is, those who do not believe, their way, nature, 
life, and what they do or suffer, perish and are lost 
forever. 


2) The following three paragraphs are printed in the editions as if 
they were three different interpretations, while it is obvious that they 
form One Whole. 

3) This time specification only in Walch. 


1766  En.52, ss3-2sk. 


The Lord knows the way of the righteous. 


The life and being of the wicked stands well for a 
time, green, blooming and resplendent, as if it wanted 
to be completely alone and remain forever. Whereas 
the life and being of the godly is nothing at all. But the 
end of the wicked is to perish like smoke, and to be 
carried away like chaff scattered by the wind, into 
eternal darkness and destruction. Who could believe 
it! Therefore be still, "Command the Lord your ways, 
and hope in him; he will do it well,” Ps. 37:5. 


The Lord knows the way of the righteous 2c. 


The life of the righteous walks in the word of God, 
as the other verse says, "but delights in the law of the 
Lord," therefore he must have happiness here and 
there, as the tree by the water always grows green, 
bears, and does not wither. But human life, even if it 
is righteous in the sight of the world, must at last 
perish and not remain. For there is not the word of 
God that abides forever. 


The Lord knows the way. 


The same is seen every day; it is not yet believed, 
and people live so securely (especially the godless) 
as if their nature would remain forever. 


The Lord knows the way. 


Flesh and blood do not believe such things. For 
even the true saints and Christians, when they see 
how unequal things are in the world, since the wicked 
are on top and the pious are underneath, they think 
that God has forgotten them, does not know them, 
does not respect them, and has even abandoned 
them. Again, the wicked, because they feel that it 
goes according to all their will, and do what they 
want, think they sit in God's bosom, who knows no 
one but they alone. Therefore, you must look at this 
verse with spiritual eyes, not with cow's eyes, so that 
God knows the way of the righteous and knows 
nothing about the wicked, otherwise you will never 
understand it. 


The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way 
of the wicked perishes. 


No godless man believes this; a godly man 
believes it, but very weakly. 1) Because 


1) Erlanger: hardly. 


Small exegetical writings. W. IX, 1353-1355. 


1767 


This requires waiting, and waiting a long time, 
because it seems much different before the eyes, 
and especially lasts a long time, that the wicked are 
green, flourish and prevail, in property, honor, power, 
according to all their will, and on the other hand the 
righteous are plagued by the devil and the world, 
both in body and soul, in honor and property, 
persecuted, also miserably murdered by them as 
rebels, heretics and children of the devil. 


The Lord knows the way. 


Believe this, and you will live; otherwise, when you 
consult your reason, you will see and experience the 
contradiction. Therefore, these things are presented 
to you through God's word, which is certainly true and 
abides forever; judge by them, you will not lack them. 
And learn that faith clings to that which is not seen, 
not to that which is before the eyes. 


Psalm 2:7. 


You are my son, today I have begotten you. 


In this saying it is known that God is a God in three 
persons, different. The first is the Father, since he 
says: "You are my Son, today | have begotten you." 
The other is the Son, Messiah, as He speaks of His 
Father, "The LORD spoke to me." The third is the 
Holy Spirit, who such. The third is the Holy Spirit, who 
pronounces this saying and the whole Psalm through 
David. 


1544. 
Psalm 2 [v. 10. 11. 1. 2) 


Let yourselves therefore be instructed, ye kings, 
And let yourselves be chastened, ye judges of the 
earth. Serve the Lord with fear, 

And rejoice with trembling. 


Why does the prophet leave out the mob and 
address only the kings and rulers? There is no doubt 
that where the rulers serve Christ the Lord and are 
obedient, the mob cannot hinder anything. But where 
they persecute or despise God's word, the mob can 
help nothing. Where churches and schools stand 
well, Christ will again know how to thank the 
authorities abundantly. But where churches and 
schools (without which the Word of God cannot 
remain)

The one who is to blame for this will be no one but

Kiss the son. 


It says that whoever accepts the Son shall have 
all grace and be a loving child; whoever does not 
must remain a child of wrath. 


Kiss the son. 1) 


It is decided that whoever does not kiss the Son, 
that is, does not believe in Christ, the Son of God, 
must be under the wrath. But whosoever believeth 
and trusteth in him shall have no trouble; he shall be 
a child of grace and of life. Joh. 3, 36. 

"Right finds itself", is a common saying. The 
histories prove this. For whether injustice has the 
process for an equally long time, it is still said in the 
end: Veritas oppugnari potest, expugnari non potest, time 
makes hay out of the grass; it greens or blossoms, 
however beautiful it wants, it must wither. Sic omnes 
impii. Ps. 92, 8. 


Blessed are all those who trust in him. 2) 


This will certainly remain true, although it has 
many a journey, nor shall it be lacking by a hair, 
They shall well become aware of it, and shall 
not resist the crowd; If it consumes this year 
and many a year. Soon the time will come when 
it will be revealed, And all things will be made 
clear, So that it can be spoken of freely. Then 
they will confess that God will keep his word

Psalm 3:9. 


With the Lord you will find help, and your blessing 
upon your people. 


With us is nothing but curse and damnation, 
brought into and over us by the devil. 


Psalm 8:5. 3) 


What is man, that you remember him, and man's 
child, that you take care of him? 2c. 


This one, whom the prophet here and the 
Scriptures often call the child or son of man, is Jesus 
Christ, the Lord over all, that is, the true, living, 
eternal God, as the Scriptures everywhere testify. 
This Psalm also confirms this powerfully, since it then 
says: "You have made Him Lord over the work of 
Your hands; You have put everything under His feet. 

From this it follows that the praiseworthy liberal 
arts, invented and brought to light by learned, 
excellent people, even though they were pagans, are 
useful and beneficial to people in this life, and are 
also the creatures and noble, precious gifts of this 
child of man (the Lord is above all), which he has 
used and still needs for his pleasure, for the praise, 
honor and glory of his holy name. 


Psalm 18:31. 


The speeches of the Lord are purified, he is a shield 
to all who trust in him. 


Proverbs 30:5. 


All of God's words are purified, and are a shield to 
those who trust in Him. 


God's word teaches to trust in God, and is a pure 
and certain word, which neither deceives nor fails, as 
words of men do. Therefore, he who learns and 
keeps it learns to trust in God. He who learns to trust 
in God has a certain protection and shield against all 
evil, be it the devil, death, sin, or whatever it may be, 
and that same for eternity. For God is almighty and 
eternal, who wants to be the protector himself, 
through his word.

marginal gloss: 800 seripsit in Homeri xodnia.

Psalm 22:7. 
I am a worm, and not a man, a mockery of the 
people and contempt of the people. 


The holy scripture is God's word, written, and (that 
| speak it thus) lettered, and formed in letters, just as 
Christ is the eternal word of God, veiled in humanity. 
And as Christ was kept and acted in the world, so is 
the written Word of God. It is a worm and not a book 
compared to other books. For such honor, with study, 
reading, contemplation, retention and use, does not 
happen to it as it does to other human writings; if it 
becomes good to it, it lies under the bench 2c. The 
others tear it, crucify it, scourge it, and put it through 
all kinds of torture, until they interpret and stretch it to 
their heresy, mind, and will, and finally even destroy, 
kill, and bury it, so that it is cast out of the world and 
forgotten, and in its place sits the whore with the 
golden chalice, the filthy and filthy bowls, and other 
books of the rotten. But it must remain and come up 
again; no guarding or defending will help. 

Therefore, it is a good sign to whom the precious 
gift is given, that he has love and pleasure for the 
Scriptures, reads them gladly, holds them high and 
valuable. God certainly honors him again, that he has 
the right seal of the called and chosen saints, and 
belongs to the apostles and other saints, who do not 
hold with the damned world that Christ is a worm, a 
mockery of the people, and despised by the people, 
but confess with St. Peter that he is the Son of the 
living God, Matth. 16, 16, and that the Scriptures are 
written by the Holy Spirit. 


Psalm 23, 1. (1541.)?) 

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. 

Whoever could believe it, would be a fat, safe, 
blessed sheep of this faithful shepherd, who has also 
laid down his life for his 3) sheep. Woe to the 
shameful unbelief that does not follow such a faithful 
shepherd and bishop of souls, and would rather be 
eaten by the wolf to eternal death.

2) The time determination is only with Walch. 
3) Erlanger: such. 





V. 4. Though I walk through the valley of the 
shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with 
me. 


God's word is a light that shines in the darkness 
and shines brighter than the sun in the middle of the 
day. For in death not only the light of this sun goes 
out, but also reason with all its wisdom. Then the 
word of God shines with all faithfulness, an eternal 
sun, which only faith sees and follows into eternal 
clear life. 


Psalm 27:4. 


One thing I ask of the Lord, and that I would like, 
is that I may remain in the house of the Lord all my 
life. 


Maneat mihi Fides in verbum, et manebo domesticus Dei 
et haeres Regni, hoc est certum; that is, let there be only 
my faith, so | will remain God's housemate and his 
kingdom's heir. 


V. 14. Wait for the Lord, be confident and 
undaunted, and wait for the Lord. 


A young man should become accustomed and 
learn to trust in God. For if he is to live, the devil will 
lay many a snare for him and blow so much evil wind 
under his eyes that he must have God's help and 
comfort, which he graciously and abundantly offers 
him through the Word. 


Wait for the Lord. 
This is God's way of consuming help and comfort, 


so that our faith may be tried and proven; then God 
will certainly not remain outside. 


Psalm 31:23. 


Be of good cheer, all you who wait for the Lord. 


Thus, the Psalter primarily promotes faith in God. 
Because the believer must suffer much from the devil 
and the world, faith and trust in God are necessary. 
For unbelief is too impatient, so good works cannot 
suffer much, for they want to be unnoticed but 
honored.

goodness.

believe in Him, trust Him with all our hearts, and call

This is what it means to have a God. 


Psalm 33:9. 


Ipse dixit, et facta sunt; ipse mandavit, et creata sunt. If he 
speaks, it is done; if he gives, it stands. 

All creatures were created by the word, and when 
he called or spoke, they stood there and said: Here 
we are. So we should not doubt what God says to us 
through His dear Son (who is His eternal Word 
Himself), that must be, stand and walk as He speaks. 
But the devil, who was the first to fall away, has so 
weakened and blinded us through original sin that we 
cannot believe or think that what he says must be 
true and true, even though he testifies and confirms 
it with miraculous signs and the creation of all 
creatures before our eyes from the beginning of the 
world, and so powerfully convicts us that (as St. Paul 
says, Apost. 17:27) we would like to grope and grasp 
him, he is so close to us. It does not help yet. But 
blessed is he who notices and loves the ipse and dixit. 


Psalm 34:12. 


Come here, children, listen to me, and I will teach you 
the fear of the Lord. 


He who fears the Lord will keep his 
commandments and not disobey. He who is obedient 
will be blessed here and there, though he must suffer 
much in such obedience. 


1) Here the Erlangen edition, whose redaction is shorter and, as 
it seems to us, more original, continues like this: "Otherwise, do not 
trust in any creatures in heaven or from earth. That is in sum so much 
said: We shall have no other gods; for to have a God is as much as 
to trust God". 


the LORD is upon them that do evil, to cut off their 


remembrance from the earth.” 

This is certainly true, but who believes it? The 
great godless multitude in the world, who ask nothing 
of God, His word and kingdom, but serve and worship 
their god, the belly, they live freely and securely in the 
rush, without any fear of God, letting nothing 
challenge them, not even thinking that God is angry 
with them, looks at them sourly, and will soon 
eradicate their memory from the earth. Moreover, 
they take pleasure and joy in it, and laugh in their fists 
when they see that the pious, who accept the word, 
hold it dear, confess it and spread it, are evil, 
persecuted, blasphemed as heretics and seducers, 
and in some cases even miserably murdered; to 
which they then also confidently help. 

Again, it grieves, saddens and offends the hearts 
of devout Christians when they see that the despisers 
of God, the "epicureans" and mammon servants, are 
so happy in the world that they lead out everything 
they undertake, trample on the pious and suppress 
them as much as they can. This makes them 
impatient at times, thinking that God has forgotten 
them, and so they lose the glorious comfort that "the 
eyes of the Lord are upon them, and his ears upon 
their cry. But be of good cheer, you who fear God, 
hold fast to the Word, believe and pray, be patient for 
a little while, and wait, for it will surely come to pass 
as the Psalm says, namely, that the Lord will help the 
righteous out of all their troubles, even though they 
must suffer much, and "the wicked who hate the 
righteous will be put to death by calamity,” v. 22.

This is a great comfort, so that every Christian can 
comfort himself in all his afflictions and say: | know 
for certain that our Lord God loves me dearly, even 
though | am now in this great distress and do not see 
how | can be helped. But | command my dear God, 
who now looks upon me in this affliction as a mother 
looks upon her little child whom she has carried 
under her heart; he will do it well; | will also ask him, 
and will certainly believe that he will hear me and 
save me. 


V. 18 When the righteous cry out, the Lord hears and 
delivers them from all their distress. 


A great certainty is this: if we call, the Lord will 
hear, and will rather hear and much more than we 
can always call. Are we not worthy of reproach for 
being so lazy as to call, when we have such glorious 
and comforting promises, and so many of them? O 
shout and cry out whoever can; there is no lack of 
hearing. And especially in this terrible last time, 
shortly before the end of the world, calling and crying 
out to God, the Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, will 
be of great need; therefore let us watch, and call 
without ceasing, so that we do not fall into 
temptation. 

Psalm 37:30, 31. 


The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his 
tongue teaches justice. The law of his God is in his 
heart; his footsteps do not slip. 

Remember, God's word must be meant in the 
heart and with seriousness, pure without any 
addition, so it makes the walk sure and safe. But the 


doctrine of men is a slippery path; one must slip and 
stumble until one breaks neck and leg. 


Psalm 40:8, 9. 


In the book it is written of me, your will, my God, I 
gladly do. 


The spirit speaks as if he knew of no book (although 
the world is full of them), but only of this book, the 
holy scripture, which is read or respected very little in 
the world. He may read it himself to his own, if he 
wants to be understood. For it writes nothing 


of men, nor of the belly (like the others all), but of the 
fact that God's Son has been obedient to the Father 
for us, and has accomplished His will. Whoever does 
not need this wisdom should leave this book, for it is 
of no use to him. It teaches a different and eternal 
life, of which reason knows nothing and can 
comprehend nothing. 

Therefore, if anyone wishes to study this book, let 
him look for nothing else in it but what the Psalm 
says, namely, that the Son of God, who willingly and 
obediently became a burnt offering for us, should 
make atonement for God's wrath in heaven and on 
earth and in all creatures. For all creatures, even the 
angels (though not willingly), are subject to vanity for 
service, Rom. 8:20, until through Christ the wrath is 
finally removed, all things are restored to their rightful 
place and brought to their first freedom, amen. 


In the book is written by me, your will 2c. 

This is the book of the Holy Spirit, namely the Holy 
Scriptures, in which one must seek and find Christ, 
not only through the promise, but also through the 
law. For even the law cannot be understood apart 
from Christ, because no one knows what it wants 
and how it is to be fulfilled; as he says here, "Your 
will, my God, | gladly do, and your law is in my heart." 
Yes, that same heart is the right living tablet, in which 
we can read the law and learn it with joy. Summa, 
apart from this book you will not find Christ, be it ever 
so good. 


In the book is written of me, your will, my God 2c. 

In which will we are all sanctified, justified and 
saved. Just as St. Paul also says in Romans 5:19: 
"Through one obedience many are made righteous. 
If you want to know what God's gracious will is, read 
this book, which teaches about Christ's obedience 
for our sins, and you will find that this is God's will, 
that we should be justified and saved through His 
Son's obedience; otherwise all our actions are 
nothing but disobedience, sin, death and hell.

This King is far different from the kings of this time, 
but we must obey him and, as he says, forget father, 
house, people and all that we have here, which this 
temporal life holds in high and glorious esteem. For 
he hath prepared for us an eternal life, where no man 
can help us, neither father, nor people, nor things that 
are on earth, but this King alone. And he shall be 
man, our King, and also God, whom we shall 
worship, which is Jesus Christ, the Son of God and 
of Mary, our dear Lord and Savior, praised by the 
Father and the Holy Spirit for ever and ever, amen. 


Listen, daughter, look at it 2c. 


Nothing is more beautiful in the sight of God than 
a soul that gladly hears this royal word. Therefore he 
speaks here: If you will hear and see; as if the Holy 
Spirit wanted to say: See, that you hold out your ears, 
open your eyes and heart, then you are a beautiful 
bride to the King, Jesus Christ, and a dear daughter 
to God the Father. Again, who does not like to hear,

Here the Holy Spirit speaks that the highest

obedient. In such people God has all His pleasure 
and joy, and they shall also be His beloved brides and 
grooms. But those who are disobedient and do not 
listen are disgraceful, displeasing people, in whom 
neither God nor men take pleasure, but only the devil, 
who is the father of lies and all disobedience, of whom 
they are also brides. God protect us from this, amen.

Psalm 55:23, 24. 


Throw your concern to the LORD, he will provide 
for you, and will not leave the righteous in trouble 
forever. But you, God, will push them down into the 
pit; the bloodthirsty and the false will not bring their 
lives to the half. But I hope in you. 


We, who confess Christ and His Word at this time, 
also have our tribulations and sufferings, and bear our 
cross, as all God's children have borne before us, 
which is a sure indication that we have the right, pure, 
divine doctrine, and are God's children, and that God 
has loaded such across on us out of His gracious will, 
for our good, so that our faith may be tried and 
proven. But we have the promise that these 
tribulations of ours will not last forever, but for a little 
while, yes, as Isaiah Cap. 54, 7. and St. Paul 2 Cor. 
4, 17. say, only for a moment (although it seems to us 
to be a long time). So Christ also comforts us John 
16:22: "Over a little while you will see me again, and 
your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take 
from you." This is also what the prophet means here 
when he says: "The Lord will not leave the righteous 
in trouble forever." 

Therefore we should not be fainthearted, not 
impatient, nor despondent, but, as the Holy Spirit 
exhorts us here, so send ourselves into the cause that 
we cast our concern upon the Lord. And because the 
matter is his, not ours (for we are persecuted for his 
word, and much ours is strangled), we should not 
doubt that he will take care of us and, according to his 
promise, will not leave us in trouble forever, but will 
miraculously deliver us from this great trouble. This is 
what we are to do, namely to call upon and pray with 
faith and from the heart to the almighty, eternal Father 
of our Savior Jesus Christ, because our enemies 
basically seek nothing else (they color and decorate 
their actions as they wish) but the destruction of right 
doctrine, and that they may again set up and confirm 
the wretched papacy's blasphemous abominations 1) 
and lies, so that he may throw the bloodthirsty and 
false ones (this is what the Holy Spirit calls them in 
Psalm 5:7) into the pit.

so that they may not bring their lives to the half, nor

to that, every one that hopes in the Lord, and loves

Cast your concern upon the Lord, and He will 
provide for you. 


Glossa St. Peter, 1 Ep. 5, 7. "Cast all your care 
upon him, for he cares for you." 

Ah! Whoever could learn "throwing" would learn 
that it is certainly so. But he who does not learn such 
throwing must remain a rejected, thrown down, 
subjugated, thrown out, cast down and overthrown 
man. 

Psalm 56:9. 


Lord, count my flight, put my tears in your sack, 
without doubt you count them. 


The prophet wants to say a lot: "If no one wants to 
consider my suffering and misery, you look so 
carefully at it, Lord, that you count all my steps in my 
flight, how far, how far away | have to be chased and 
run, do not forget any tears that | cry; but | know that 
you write them all down in your register and will not 
forget them. From this, according to the example of 
David, each one who is persecuted by the enemies 
of the truth and driven into misery for the sake of 
confessing Christian doctrine, take this comfort that 
he is certain and does not doubt that his flight, his 
tears are all counted and reckoned before God, all the 
footsteps and steps that become sore to him are 
written down, and all the tears are put in God's bag, 
so that not one shall fall or be forgotten. 

But if it comes to this, out of God's gracious will, 
that someone has to endure and die, let him 
command his soul to God, as the faithful Creator and 
Savior, and let this be his comfort, that God will 
preserve all his bones, so that not one of them shall 
be broken, Ps. 34, 21. As also Christ speaks Luc. 12, 
7: "Your hairs on your head are all numbered" 2c.

you do this to me, who now, born a man into the world, 
live, walk, stand, create, and know you through your 
word; although it seems much different before my 
eyes, and my old Adam, who hangs from my neck to

But it seems and feels as it will, | do not turn to it,

Psalm 98:1. 


Sing to the Lord a new song, for he does wonders. 
He conquers with his right hand and with his holy 
arm. 


Since the Holy Spirit calls us all to sing, it is certain 
that He also calls us to accept such miracles as have 
been performed and proclaimed for our salvation and 
good. Therefore, the doubt and unbelief is 
condemned here, who says: "What do | know, 
whether God has done such victory and miracles for 
me by His right hand or by His arm (that is, by His 
Son)? Hear (says the Spirit), to you, to you, itis done, 
you, you, you shall sing, be glad, and give thanks; this 
is my will and opinion.

W. IX, 1368-1372. 1781 





In the same way as in the example, all believers in 
Christ are exhorted to praise and give thanks to God 
with all their heart. 

The first is that all our sins are forgiven us in and 
through Christ, our one Mediator and High Priest, who 
incurred the righteous and terrible wrath of God 
against our sin, and offered Himself for it to God, 
thereby reconciling the eternal Father and 
representing us without fail. 

The other is that for the sake of Christ, God will not 
impute to us the remaining sins that still cling to us 
until the pit, of which there are only many, in addition 
great and heavy, but will cover them all, cleanse them 
and heal them. 

The third is that he also saves us daily from many 
dangers of death, since we often should have 
perished in fire, water, item, sword, pestilence, or 
other plagues because of our sin, and keeps us alive 
out of pure grace. 

The fourth, that He crown us above with grace and 
mercy, as with a shield, giving the Holy Spirit, who 
upholds us in the truth, comforts us in all our troubles, 
and adorns us with His gifts. 

The fifth, that He may also give us courage and 
joy, that we both, with heart and mouth, may 
confidently and undauntedly praise and preach such 
benefits of God before all the world, for the benefit 
and betterment of many, that they may also recognize 
God's grace and mercy, praise Him for it, and call 
upon Him in time of need. 

The sixth, that we may be restored in Christ and 
made new creatures in God's image, that by the help 
of the Holy Spirit, whom we have received through 
faith, we may willingly begin to render to God the new 
obedience that will be perfect in that life 2c. 


Psalm 107:20.

word and accepts what it says. But what God (who 
certainly keeps faith) speaks and promises in His 
word (which endures forever), the fleshly heart does 
not want to accept that it is God's word, which is 
certain and true. People may well have

a great desire, when things are going badly for them 
(having nothing of their own, being imprisoned, lying 
in mortal peril, floating in danger on the water, 
suffering theurung half distress, being harassed and 
oppressed by tyrants), for help and salvation from all 
these distresses, which God creates and provides 
through His word, as the Psalm reports here: "God 
sent His word and helped them" 2c. 

But they lack that they do not believe that Suum 
Acerbum, his, his (God's) word is certain, firm and true; 
therefore they also do not seek help in their needs 
from him, but verbum suum, id est, porcorum et scrofarum, 
that is, follow their carnal sense, whose fruits they will 
also reap (instead of the temporal welfare and gentle 
life they sought), namely hell and eternal damnation. 
So they have fished well. 


Psalm 109:31. 


The Lord is at the right hand of the poor, to help 
him from those who condemn his life. 


Note that ordinary judges and _ authorities 
persecute and condemn Christ and his followers to 
death, which they should protect and defend. If Turks 
or unchristian tyrants did it, it would be no wonder. 
But because it is done by those who bear the name 
and title of Christian authorities, it is extremely 
painful. But what reward such persecutors finally get 
is shown in the following Psalm (Ps. 110:5, 6): "The 
Lord at thy right hand shall smite the kings in the time 
of his wrath" 2c. "He will bruise the head over many 
lands." And Ps. 2:4, 5: "He who dwells in heaven 
laughs at them, and the LORD mocks at them. He 
shall speak to them in his wrath, and with his fury 
shall he make them afraid." Item, v. 12: "His wrath will 
soon burn." 


Psalm 110, 1. 


Sit at my right hand. 


He sets Him very high, not at Rome, nor at 
Constantinople, but at His right hand, where He will 
sit secure from His enemies. Now let him who is 
afraid put on armor; if it helps, it helps. But we know 
that it must help, because he lives and remains. 


alive, the XXXXX XX, that is, the Lord, to whom the 
Lord said, "Sit at my right hand." There itis. Therefore 
rejoice in the LORD, and sing joyfully all the 
righteous, and praise all the upright. Ps. 32, 11. 


Psalm 112, 1. 


Blessed is he who fears the Lord, who has great 
delight in his commandments. 


Of course, he will not be afraid of the devil, much 
less of sin, death and all misfortune, whatever it may 
be called, that the devil is a founder and causer. 
Cause, he already has, through the word he believes, 
all the heavenly goods, forgiveness of sins, 
righteousness, eternal life and bliss, which the Son of 
God acquired for him through his death and 
resurrection. And if it is only for a little while, he will 
indeed possess them in eternal joy and delight; this 
is certainly true. 


Psalm 116:10, 15. 


I believe, therefore I speak; but I am greatly afflicted. 
The death of his saints is worthy in the sight of the 
Lord. 


If this is true, then the saints who believe, speak 
or confess, and are afflicted and suffer because of it 
(for of such the psalm speaks), will look upon death 
differently than the unbelieving great multitude in the 
world, namely, for a blessed departure and passage 
from this misery and misery valley (where the devil is 
prince and God) into that life where there will be 
inexpressible and glorious joy and eternal bliss. They 
work diligently at this art, studying and practicing it 
daily, asking earnestly that our dear Lord Jesus 1) 
Christ may give them a blessed hour, and then 
comfort them through His Spirit, so that they may 
commit their little souls to Him in right faith, 
knowledge and confession. To such, death is not 
terrible, but a dear welcome, especially at this last 
perilous time. For through death, as the Scripture 
says, Isa. 57:1, 2, "they are snatched away from 
calamity, come to peace, and rest in their chambers.

On the other hand, there is nothing more horrible 
and terrible to the unbelievers, of which they are 
more terrified, trembling and fearful, than death. 
Cause, the gospel will not come to them (will remain 
silent that they should confess it and suffer over it), 
because it is a word from the cross, and preaches of 
future heavenly, eternal goods, which one must hope 
for and expect in patience, after which they ask little, 
but rather they strive for it with the greatest diligence, 
so that they may get honor, riches, power, good days 
in this life, and thus send themselves into it, as if they 
wanted to stay here forever. 

But because all these things are uncertain and 
transitory, of which they are not sure for a moment, 
they act as fools, so that their heart hangs on the 
temporal and relies on it, and thereby neglect, even 
despise, persecute and blaspheme the dear word, 
which alone shows us the way to heaven and can 
comfort us in all kinds of distress and death. 

Therefore it serves them right that when they think 
they want to live best, death overtakes them and 
snatches them away, and both lose this and that life, 
and receive eternal death and damnation as a 
reward. This is a horrible, terrible death, protect us 
from it, dear Lord Jesus Christ, amen. 


Psalm 118, 14. (1544.)!) 


The LORD is my strength, and my psalm, and is my 
salvation. 


On nothing shall we rely nor defy, but on the Lord, 
who shall be our strength, and do all things in us. For 
this we shall praise and give thanks to him, that he 
alone may be our psalm; so we shall surely be 
blessed in him. From this it follows that this Lord is 
Jesus Christ, true God, born of the Father in eternity, 
and also true man, born of Mary when the time was 
fulfilled, because he is praised here as our power or 
strength, psalm and salvation. 


The Lord is my power, and my psalm, and is my 
salvation.

powerless in ourselves, and

victory and salvation into eternal life. 


V. 22. The stone that the builders rejected has 
become the cornerstone. 


So it must go. For thus it is written that Christ and 
his followers are despised by the world, by the best, 
the most learned, the "greatest," as those who are 
called the world's helpers and governors, and who 
alone want to be the right builders of all classes. 
Nevertheless, he is and remains the cornerstone 
from which all who believe in him are built, and 
through him they are saved. On the other hand, the 
builders who reject him will always die one by one 
like cattle, and go to hell, because their worm will not 
die and their fire will not go out. Isa. 66, 24. 


Psalm 119:1. 2) 


Blessed are those who live without change, who walk 
in the law of the Lord. 


The highest comfort is when one is certain that his 
deeds are God's command. For he can finally stand, 
and must succeed against all devils, the world and all 
evil, if he holds fast to it. But what is without God's 
word must finally dissolve, even if all the devils and 
the world hold on to it with iron mountains and steel 
trees. 


V. 4. You commanded to diligently keep your 
commands. 


It is especially important to note the word "your", 
which is found in almost all verses, or in each of them 
evenly, 3) so that he will tear us away from the 
teachings of men and keep us with God's teachings. 

Therefore, one should also follow with the heart, 
and if the same word, show reluctance in the heart to 
the doctrine of men. 


2) In this Psalm, because in the old Bibles the verse numbers are 
not available, in the Wittenberg and in the Jena editions the 
octonaries (divisions of eight verses each) are given. Walch 
misunderstood this, considered it to be a determination of time, and 
therefore "1. Oct." 2c. resolved by: "October 1," 2c. We have not 
designated the octonaries because the number of verses is given.

V. 5. Oh that my life would keep your rights with all 


seriousness. ') 

Whoever does not investigate God's word, gladly 
reads it, gladly hears it, and lets it be his daily bread, 
will never keep it. But he who loves to study it, to read 
it, to hear it, and to handle it daily, he is surely the 
one who keeps it. The same also thanks God for such 
grace. For it is impossible that he should despise 
God's word, regardless of whether the flesh is weak 
and its nature rages against the spirit. But whoever 
begins to despise it, will soon thereafter persecute it, 
and finally blasoheme and condemn it, as one, 
unfortunately, experiences daily. 


V. 9: How will a young man go his way blamelessly? 


If he keeps himself according to your words. ”) 
Although people of all ages should let themselves 
be governed by God's word, this is especially 
necessary for the youthful age, before it absorbs 
wrong opinions and is thereby corrupted. For there is 
little hope in the old who are already corrupted, as 
Jeremiah says [Cap. 13, 23. loosely from the 
Vulgate’: "If a Moor can walk fine skin, ye also shall 
lose 3) to do evil." Therefore also the heathen and 
the godless have noticed that much lies in what one 
gets used to. Thus the poet says: Principiis obsta, 
sero medicina paratur. It is better preserved than 
lamented, say the Germans (dicit Germania). 1545.

V. 60. I hasten and do not delay to keep your 
commandments. 


A godly man, who waits for God's word of his 
profession, is always skilled and ready to do much 
good, and does it without ceasing; what he 
undertakes is done by him, and no human 
commandment can hinder him or turn him away from 
it. So he does more good in one hour than an ungodly 
man does all his life. Cause, because his deeds are 
done in faith and obedience to God, God gives his 
blessing and prosperity to them. On the other hand, a 
wicked man can do nothing but evil, and does it 
without ceasing. For since he does not live his life 
according to God's word, and does not desire to know 
it, but despises it, and does something special of his 
own choice, against God's command, even if he does 
much and everything, it is still called nothing done. 
For "obedience is better than sacrifice." And "he who 
does not gather with me,” says Christ Luc. 11:23, 
"scatters. 


V 92. If your law had not been my comfort, I would

v. 98. You make me wiser with your 
commandment than my enemies are; for it is my 


treasure forever. 

The devil is called and is a thousandfold artist, yet 
he must become a fool, and with all his cunning and 
violence become a disgrace, even to the poor Lazaro, 
or least, most despised Christian, that he cannot 
harm him. Cause, a Christian is much too wise for him 
and all his limbs (as high and clever as they are), 
because he sticks to God's word, which is a divine 
power and wisdom that gives strength, counsel and 
action to the faithful, so that they finally prevail against 
all their enemies and win, even if they have to suffer 
much because of it. 


V. 99. lam more learned than all my teachers, for 


your testimonies are my speech. 

God's wisdom is nowhere to be found except in 
His Word. Whoever loves and values it, and always 
deals with it, is not only an enlightened doctor, proven 
by God, over all other worldly wise men and scholars, 
but also a judge over all wisdom and doctrine, both of 
devils and men. Again, whoever does not mean God's 
word in earnest, but follows the teachings and 
wisdom of men, and lives and governs his life 
according to them, is and remains an unlearned 
student of the Scriptures all his life. And even if he 
talks and writes a lot about it, and therefore makes 
himself believe that he is a master of it, he still does 
not understand anything about it, is drowned in his 
carnal thoughts, is deceived, and deceives others.

Iam more learned than all 2c. 


Is this not strange talk? He calls them his 
teachers, and yet he confesses that they did not 
teach him God's word. Should we not also say the 
same against the papists, who want to be and be 
called our teachers, and can themselves do nothing? 
| am more learned than you, because you idols sit 
there in office, and can teach nothing of God's word, 
but vain lies. 

(1546.)?) 


V. 100. I am wiser than the ancients, for I keep your 
command. 


This is a perverse and annoying speech, that the 
old, that is, the ecclesiastics, scholars, wise 2c. 
should learn from the young, and become fools, 
when naturally and properly the young should learn 
from the old. This now makes the pope and his 
foolish, that we cannot suffer their old violins of 
human laws, and call us heretics, as those who want 
to be wiser than the old. But here it says that the 
young, who have God's word, study and practice, 
shall be wiser than the old, because they do not have 
nor want to have God's word, and must remain old 
fools, die, and be eternally damned 2c. 


Tam smarter 2c. 

Yes, of course, the holy scripture is the highest, 
yes, only and divine wisdom. That is why it makes 
young people wiser than the old, and who they are, 
who want to be wise without, even against the holy 
scripture. As also the19. Psalm, v. 8, says: "The 
testimony of the Lord is sure, and makes the foolish 
wise.” 


V. 105. Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to 
my path. 


Reason is also a light, and a beautiful light. But the 
way and the foot that should go out of sins and death 
to righteousness and life, it cannot show nor meet, 
but remains in darkness. Just as our unlit and waxed 
lights do not illuminate the heavens, nor the earth, but 
the narrow corners of houses; but the sun illuminates 
the heavens, the earth, and the earth itself.

everything: so God's word is also the right sun, which 
gives us the eternal day to live and to be joyful. Such 
a word is given abundantly and sweetly in the Psalter. 
Happy is he who has a desire for it and likes to see 
such light, for it likes to shine. But mice and bats do 
not like it, that is, the world. 

Your word is my foot 2c. 

Whoever seeks another light than God's word, will 
certainly find vain wispy ones, in which it is much 
more dangerous to walk, neither in the darkness 
itself. For such false light is twofold darkness: 
because it not only leads astray into darkness, but 
does not allow itself to be shown any light, indeed, 
wants to be light itself. Therefore its darkness cannot 
be helped. It is much better to be badly dark; then one 
can help and point to the light. 

Your word is my foot 2c. 

If this is true, as it cannot be lacking, then it must 
also be true that apart from God's word all human 
teaching and wisdom, which shines and glows as 
beautifully and gloriously as it can, is vain darkness. 

Therefore Peter also says, 2 Ep. 1, 19: "You do 
well to pay attention to our firm prophetic word, as to 
a light that shines in a dark place. Here he calls the 
world, with all its glory and supreme power, a dark 
place where the sun of righteousness does not shine. 

It is true that human wisdom and the liberal arts 
are noble gifts of God, good and useful for all kinds 
of things; therefore one cannot do without them even 
in this life. But we can never be thoroughly informed 
about what is sin and righteousness before God, how 
we can be rid of sins, become righteous before God, 
and come from death to life. This requires a divine 
wisdom and the right golden art: these are not to be 
found in any lawyer's or worldly wise book, but only 
in the Bible, which is the book of the Holy Spirit. 


Your word is my foot 2c. 


So often and so powerfully does Scripture teach 
us that we should neither do nor undertake anything 
without God's Word, that we may be sure. 





how we should walk rightly before God and how our 
lives should please Him. The world still wants to 
follow the wrong and its own wisdom. As the Lord 
John 3:19 says: "The light has come into the world, 
but men prefer darkness to light. 

Your word is the lamp of my foot. 

Where God's word does not shine, there can be 
nothing but darkness and erroneous ways. Therefore 
the Lord says John 8:12, Cap. 12:35: "| am the light 
of the world. "Walk in the light, because ye have the 
light, that darkness overtake you not. For the night is 
coming, in which you can work nothing.” 

V. 103. 127. Your word is sweeter than honey to my 
mouth. Therefore I love your commandments above 
gold and fine gold. 

If we are to be blessed, we must come to the point 
where God is dearer to us than the creature, and 
heaven is more pleasing than all that is on earth; for 
there is no abiding here, but we must go there, where 
we can come with pleasure and not with displeasure, 
as Psalm 34:9 says: "Taste and see how sweet or 
pleasant the Lord is. And Psalm 73:25, 26: "If | have 
thee only, | ask nothing of heaven and earth. Though 
my body and soul languish, yet, O God, thou art 
always the comfort of my heart and my portion.” But 
against this says Sirach Cap. 41, 1. 2.:"O death, how 
bitter thou art, when a man remembers thee, who 
hath good days and plenty, and liveth without sorrow, 
and is well in all things, and may yet eat well." 


Your testimonies are my eternal inheritance, for they 
are the delight of my heart. 

This means that God's word is gloriously praised, 
and that we are reminded with pleasure to read that 
it is not a temporal inheritance that must pass away, 
but an eternal inheritance that may nourish and 
sustain us forever. If a man could believe this, how 
little would he regard the glory, goods, and joy of this 
life (or rather of death), and as life is mortal every 
hour, so also goods, honor, splendor, and everything, 
mortal. But against this [the] flesh and the afflicted 
devil are armed in the strongest possible way," that 
one is blinded and

V. 165. Great peace have they that love thy law, and 
shall not stumble. ') 


Again, those must have great strife, and cling to 
men or to the devil, or their disciples fine, who 
despise or hate God's law; for there can be no 
peaceful conscience or heart against God, but must 
suffer temporal unrest here, and eternal strife and 
hellish torment there. But he says, "Those who love 
your law." For it is not enough to read God's word in 
the book alone, or to carry it in your mouth, but you 
must have it in your heart, that is, you must have a 
desire and love for it. Then you will be safe from 
stumbling and trouble. For love for the word of God 
does not allow heresy or evil. Therefore St. Paul says 
in 2 Thess. 2, 10. f. that the reason why God sends 
powerful errors is that they have not accepted the 
love of truth. 1544 Martin Luther, D. 

Great peace have 2c. 

He who lives without God's word must stumble, 
err and fall without ceasing, and cannot have a good, 
peaceful conscience. For he himself does not know 
what he is doing, or how he is with God. For God 
does not take care of him, because he neglects and 
despises His word. 

Psalm 143:5. 
I remember the former times, I speak of all your 
deeds, and say of the works of your hands. 

The holy Christian church is the most noble work 
of God, for the sake of which everything was created. 
In it the great miracles take place daily, as forgiving 
sin, taking away death, giving righteousness and 
eternal life, which no one sees except faith, therefore 
it must be preached through the Word. Unbelief does 
not see anything, not even the sun, the heavens and 
the earth, or does not consider it to be God's work, 
but needs it like a cow or a sow, because it does not 
speak of it, nor does it praise the Creator for it. 


1) This saying is found in the second part of the (Col. 1762) 
already mentioned Bible in the princely library at Dessau. 


1793 
Psalm 145:4. 
Children's children will praise your works and 
speak of your power. 


Divine works and power are which he exercises 
through his word. By his word heaven and earth were 
created and preserved; then by his word death and 
the devil, sin and all evil were overcome (and are still 
being overcome daily), and all blessedness was 
given to us in Christ our Savior. As he says Joh. 8, 
51: "Whoever keeps my word will not see death 
forever." And Rom. 1, 16: "The gospel is the power 
of God, which makes all who believe in it fearful." 


V. 5. I will speak of your glorious, beautiful 
splendor, and of your wonders. 


Flesh and blood, born in sins, does not let us see 
in this life what beautiful works and wonders God 
does for us. Therefore it must be preached, spoken 
of, heard, so that we may believe it through the Word 
and begin to know it until we get there; then we will 
see with the dear angels what we are now preaching 
and hearing, yet we will not be satisfied, yet we will 
live eternally from it, as John 17:3 of which 2) is 
written: Haec est vita aeterna etc. 


V. 10-12 All thy works give thee thanks, O LORD; 
and thy saints praise thee, and magnify the glory of 
thy kingdom, and speak of thy power, that the 
children of men may know thy might, and the 
glorious majesty of thy kingdom. 


He who likes to preach, read, write, speak, listen, 
or remember God's word with earnestness is the one 
who praises, extols, and thanks God's kingdom and 
power, honor and miracles. For in the word we have 
the works and wonders that God works on us and in 
us, and makes us His kingdom. 


V. 13. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, 
and your dominion endures forever.

that has hitherto led with all honors. Many kings and 
monarchs, even the most powerful ones, who have 
been on earth, have taken it upon themselves to 
suppress and destroy the kingdom of Christ, that is, 
His church or people who have His word, diligently 
practice it, hear it, learn it, confess it, and call upon 
Him in right faith; but they have not succeeded, and 
one after another has always perished and fallen to 
the ground, as the Scriptures testify about Pharaoh, 
2 Mos. 14, 28, Sanherib, 2 Kings 19, 37, and many 
others. 

On the other hand, Christ's kingdom or church has 
existed for all time and has remained until us; 
although it has been, still is, and will remain to be 
seen as a small and weak group against the world's 
multitude and power, and will always have to suffer 
much pressure and coercion from the devil and his 
members; it will also remain until the last day, 
although the devil and the world oppose it in the most 
hostile way, and with all their power and cunning, 
they are willing to exterminate it. For here it is written: 
"Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom". No one 
should or will hinder this, but must let it remain true, 
without his thanks. And Psalm 2, 6. God says: "| have 
set my Son on my holy mountain." And Psalm 110, 
1: "Sit at my right hand." There he will certainly 
remain safely seated before all his enemies, and, if 
God wills, will soon put them at the footstool of his 
feet, amen. 


V. 18, 19: The Lord is near to all who call on him, to 
all who call on him earnestly. He does what the godly 
desire, hears their cries and helps them. 


Here you hear that God is inclined and ready to 
hear, help, do or give us everything that we ask and 
desire from Him according to His will. But that such 
things do not happen to us is our fault, because we 
do not see or feel our misfortune, misery and 
distress, which is only great and various, and 
therefore do not cry and call out to him in right faith 
and confidence in his promise, which is certain and 
true in Christ, nor do we earnestly desire his help. 
This is what we have to thank our old Adam for, the 
sorrowful unbelief. May God strengthen our faith, 
amen. 


Psalm 149:1. 
Sing to the Lord a new song, let the congregation 
of the saints praise him. 


A new song, thanksgiving and sermon belong to 
a new miraculous work. This is the new miraculous 
work of God, that through His dear Son He has torn 
apart the right sea of red and death, and delivered us 
from the right Pharaoh, Satan. This means a new 
song, namely, singing the holy gospel and thanking 
God for it. May God help us, amen. 

Such a new song shall also help the following 
Psalm to sing, and Wolf Heinz, 1) and all pious 
Christian musicians, both, with their organs, 
symphonies, virginal, 2) regal, and what is more of 
the dear Musica, of which (as of very new art and 
God's gift) neither David nor Solomon, neither Persia, 
Grecia, nor Roma, knew anything, let their singing 
and playing go with joy, in praise of the Father of all 
graces, Amen. 


Sing to the Lord a new song. 


To such a new song also belongs a new singer 
and new miracles, that is, you must be baptized in 
the new testament, and not live in the law; also the 
new miracles that God's Son has done through 
Himself, overcoming sin, death, hell, and bringing 
you to eternal life, where you believe otherwise. 
These are not the old miracles in the Red Sea, shown 
to the children of Israel in this life. 


From the Proverbs of Solomon. 


Short Summarium on the Proverbs of Solomon. 


Take care, take care, my dear child, Many are 
the bad boys. They live like sows and cattle, 
and remain blind in sin. 

But soon she finds God's punishment. And 
make her the child of the devil. 


1) Wolf Heinz was an organist at Halle (De Wette, Vol. V, p. 589). 
Probably Luther wrote this interpretation in 1541 in a Bible, which he 
gave him as a gift. On Nov. 10, 1541, he wrote about it to Jonas (De 
Wette, vol. V, p. 408): "Wolf Heinz has answered nothing of the Bible, 
which | have with me as a gift for him, as | wrote." 

2) Birginal is similar in shape to the piano, a kind of spinet. - Regal 
is a pipework of the organ; a small portable organ.

W. IX, 1390-1382. 1797 





Beware of him, and do not follow him. 
Remember God, who fights everything. 
Truly, his judgment is not jesting, as the holy 
scripture tells us; 

Even if a boy himself is dense. He has no 
need of him for a long time, And asks nothing 
of God's commandment, Even takes his 
parents’ word for a mockery, Soon death 
overtakes him. 

Therefore, my child and dear son, Listen to 
King Solomon, He already gives you much of 
the teaching, 1) Which pleases God in the 
heavenly throne. And you will be richly 
rewarded, if you have diligently done so. 


Cap. 8, 17. 36. 2) 
I love those who love me, and those who seek me 
early find me. But whoever sins against me injures 


his soul. All who hate me love death. 

Wisdom is the word of God, by which all things 
were created, Genesis 1:3: "God said, Let there be 
light" 2c. It is the same wisdom or word of God that 
speaks to all people in the holy scriptures and 
through the mouth of all saints, and gives life to all 
who seek it and gladly hear it. For it is gladly found, 
and is gladly with men, to counsel and help them. As 
it is said: God greets many who could thank him. But 
the greatest multitude can neither be advised nor 
helped; they prefer death and damnation to life and 
blessedness. 


Cap. 18, 22. 
He who finds a wife finds something good, and can 


be of good cheer in the Lord. 

For a Christian husband, even if it sometimes 
happens unevenly, he knows that his marriage state, 
and what he does or suffers in it, is called well done 
and well suffered before God. For the marriage state, 
created, founded, and ordered by God, is also 
governed by Him. 


1) already - beautiful. 
2) This interpretation is found in Ootttr. Olearii Leriniurn nntiHunriurn 
etc., p. 153 8<p Olearius took it from a Bible preserved in the 
Marienbibliothek at Halle. Reprinted in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 359. We 
give the text according to the Wittenberg. Only the last sentence is 
different: "But the crowd prefers death, and wants death more than 
life." 





The devil should otherwise turn everything around in 
a short time. Otherwise, the devil should turn 
everything around in a short time, as God sometimes 
decrees him to do in some married couples as an 
example. In this 3) we learn that God alone is the right 
grandfather of all legitimate children. Such is not the 
case in fornication and adultery or other evil, carnal 
debauchery. 
Cap. 30, 5. 


All of God's words are purified, and are a shield to 
those who trust in Him. 


The gloss and understanding of Scripture is called 
trusting and believing God, without which it is 
impossible for anyone to understand a letter in it; 
rather, he will be annoyed by it. For it is not how a 
faithless heart thinks or wills, but futura et non 
apparentia, they are called, of which God's word 
speaks. Therefore you must believe and wait until it 
comes. Certainly it will come, if you believe and wait, 
not only eternal life, but also here the temporal help 
in the present distress, which seems long to us, 
because it lasts and presses. 


All the words of God are 2c. 


God's word is refined, for it is proven and purer 
than gold, tried by fire, so that nothing is lost from it, 
but all its heat appears, and it is and remains fine 
gold. So he that keepeth the word, and believeth, 
overcometh all things, and is strong and sure against 
all things for ever. For he is protected with such a 
shield, who neither shuns nor fears sin, death and the 
devil, but the gates of hell fear and flee from him. For 
the word of God abideth for ever, and maketh them 
to stand firm and steadfast against all evil 4) that trust 
therein. 


All the words of God are 2c. 


Without God's word, the devil has won, for nothing 
can resist him, nor can he defend himself, without 
God's word alone. Whoever takes hold of it, believes 
in it, and sticks to it, has won. Therefore we should 
not forget it, much less despise it; for the devil does 
not sleep nor celebrate.

Cap. 31, 30. 
To be lovely and beautiful is nothing; a woman 


who fears the Lord is to be praised. 

That is, a woman can live with her husband 
conjugally and godly, and be a fine housewife with a 
clear conscience, but above and beside that she 
should fear God, believe and pray. 


From the prophet Isaiah. 
Cap. 7, 9. ') 
If you do not believe, you will not remain. 
That is, you will lack everything you undertake 
without faith, even if it were all wisdom, power, art 
and wealth, for God will not let it succeed. 2) 


Isa. 23, 8. 
Absorpsit mortem in victoriam. 
He has swallowed death whole. 

When death is completely swallowed up, there 
must surely be life. And this alone shall do, saith 
Jeshua, the LORD of hosts; that is, Jesus Christ, the 
Son of Mary, one God with God the Father and the 
Holy Ghost, blessed for ever and ever, Amen. 


Isa. 25, 8. 3) 
Absorpta est mors in victoriam, Isa. 25. 
[Hebrew] 


praecipitavit mortem in aeternum. 
Because Adam lives (that is, sins), death devours 
life. But when Christ dies (that is, becomes 
righteous), life devours death. Praise be to God that 
Christ dies and is justified. Martin Luther, D. 1543. 


Isa. 25, 8. 
The Lord will wipe away the tears from "‘all faces" 
and will lift up the reproach of His people in all lands. 


1) The heading in the editions: "Isa. 28." is wrong; therefore we 
have put this interpretation in its right place. 

2) Another interpretation of Isa. 7, 9. is found in the Table Talks, 
Cap. 50, § 5. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXII, 1331. 

3) The Bible in which this saying is found is in the library of the 
Augustinian monastery at Erfurt (Erl. Ausg., vol. 56, p. I*XX). - 
Aurifaber brings this up in the Tischreden, Cap. 48, § 43, as a speech 
of Luther. In our edition of the Tischreden, this piece has been 
omitted. 





When death is completely swallowed up, sin has 
also completely lost its power, so that it can no longer 
irritate or frighten, and must now be trapped and 
condemned for eternity. So the punishment of sins 
and all plagues must also cease, and joy, life, bliss, 
praise and glory to God must begin and last forever. 
This begins in this life, in the believers; but it is still 
mixed, always runs tribulation, sorrow, fear and 
trouble with it. For the serpent's bite and sting in the 
heels rages and rages as long as the world stands. 
But there it will be right and complete, and will last 
forever without any hindrance. 4) As in the Revelation 
of John this saying is referred to and interpreted to 
the new Jerusalem, Cap. 21, 4. 


Isa. 30, 15. 


If you remained silent, you would be helped; by being 
silent and hoping, you would be strong. 


That is, God helps the patient who expect comfort 
and help from Him, not to be angry or grumble 
against God, not to make noise out of impatience, not 
to seek forbidden help, or to rush to human comfort 
2c. Summa, suffering and hoping is the Christian's 
victory. 


Isa. 40, 8. 


The word of our God endures forever. 


That is, it holds firm, is certain, does not waver, 
does not flinch, does not sink, does not lack, does not 
miss. Where this word comes into the heart with right 
faith, it makes the heart firm, sure and certain, so that 
it becomes stiff, upright and hard against all 
temptation, the devil, death and whatever it may be 
called, that it defiantly and arrogantly despises and 
mocks everything that wants to be doubtful, hesitant, 
evil and angry, because it knows that God's word 
cannot lie to it. 


God's word abides forever. 


Whoever believes this to be true must also believe 
what is written there, v. 6: Omnis caro foenum, all flesh 
is like grass that withers and does not remain until the 
end. 

4) The preceding three sentences: "Das sahet... ewiglich wahren" 


are missing in the Erlangen edition, but are in the Wittenberg and 
Jena editions.

tomorrow. As Matth. 6, 30. is written: "If God so 
clothes the grass of the field, which today stands, and 
tomorrow is thrown into the oven" 2c. We also 
experience this daily, how we die and wither away 
like the grass, and even less: we still do not want the 
word that abides forever, and helps us to abide 
forever with it, but cling to yours, which cannot make 
us secure forever, even not for a moment. Thus we 
go with the vain mammon, belly, and what are more 
of the beautiful flowers of the corrupt flesh, to eternal 
ruin. 1) 


Isa. 55, 11. 


My word that goes forth from my mouth shall not 
return to me void, but shall do that which I please, 
and shall prosper when I send it. 

This is a comforting saying, where we could 
believe that God is talking to us, and God's word is 
what we read or hear in the Bible. There we would 
find and feel that it would not be read or heard without 
fruit nor in vain. But the cursed unbelief and the 
afflicted flesh do not let us see or consider that God 
speaks to us in the Scriptures, or that it is God's word, 
but think that it is Isaiah, Paul, or some other bad man 
who did not create heaven and earth. Therefore, it is 
not God's word to us, nor does it bear fruit until God's 
word is recognized in us. 


Isa. 59, 21. 


My spirit which is with thee, and my words which I 
have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy 
mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of 
the mouth of thy child (saith the LORD), from 
henceforth even for ever. 

That is, | am God and want to remain God, which 
you, devil, shall not refuse, and let me remain an 
eternal preacher, that nevertheless my word always 
for and for and always helps the poor sinners to 
eternal life. Make it as curly as you like, so the seed 
of the woman shall tread you on the head, and speak 
when you must be silent. 


1) "into eternal perdition" is missing in the Erlanger. 


(1542.2) 
From the prophet Daniel. 
Cap. 11, 37. 


He will not respect women's love, nor some of 
God's. 

That God does not want fornication, adultery or 
other abuses of the male and female body is clearly 
and powerfully taught by the sixth commandment: 
You shall not commit adultery. Again, he also wants 
the male and female bodies to be married to each 
other, so that they are called one body, for the 
breeding of children, and to avoid sin against the sixth 
commandment. And honor them highly in the fourth 
commandment, giving honor to father and mother, 
next to him. From this you can see what kind of devil 
the pope is, who destroys such a commandment and 
work of God, not only in deed, but also, as if it were 
well done, teaches to do such things, and thus, as the 
true anti-Christ, rejects and condemns God's 
commandment and work. 


From the prophet Habakkuk. 
Cap. 2, 4. 
The righteous lives by his faith. 
A wonderful speech is this, faith is to be life. Why? 
Because he hangs on the word, by which all things 
were created, live and remain, which is Jesus Christ, 


John 1:1, 14: "In the beginning was the Word, and the

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, and exult, O 
daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your King is coming

That is, Christ, your God and Lord, is your 
Righteous One and Savior, who will bring and help 
you from sin to righteousness, from death to life. And 
this he will do, not by sword and spear, but by his 
humility, meekness, poverty, misery, suffering and 
death. You may well be comforted and rejoice in such 
a king, who is sure that after this short miserable life 
you will be with

Man does not live by bread alone, but by every 
word that proceeds from the mouth of God. 


For so Moses writes that all things are also

Matth. 5, 6. 


Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for 
righteousness, for they shall be filled. 


This hunger and thirst is felt wnen a person likes 
to hear and read God's word; he certainly has the 
hope that he will find refreshment and certain comfort 
through the word in all kinds of trials, hardship and 
death. But those who are full, that is, who do not hear 
or read God's word, but turn a deaf ear to it and 
despise it, will finally be so hungry and thirsty that no 
one will refresh them with even the smallest drop of 
water, as was the case with the rich man in hell, who 
could not be refreshed in the flame with the smallest 
finger of Lazari, Luc. 16, 24. It is said, "Believe in the 
light while you have it, that you may be the children 
of light," John 12, 36. Item: "See that you do not 
receive the grace of God in vain, now is the 
acceptable time," 2c. 2 Cor. 6, 1. 2. 


Matth. 7, 7. 
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall 
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 


He who neither gets nor finds anything has 
certainly not asked nor sought. And to whom it is not 
opened, he certainly has not knocked. Therefore, if 
we lack anything, there is no doubt that we are 
lacking; God cannot be lacking, who is so willing, 
inclined and ready to give that He not only means to 
ask, diligently seek and confidently knock, but also 
assures us with a precious oath through His only 
begotten Son, whom He has made a propitiation for 
us.

and intercessor, saying Matth. 17, 5: "This is my

Joh. 16, 23: "Verily, verily, | say unto you, if ye shall 
ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it 
you." God does not give happiness to lazy hands that 
do not take hold here, amen. 


Ask and it will be given to you 2c. ”) 


This is clearly said, that our asking, seeking, 
knocking, should not be in vain, but that everything 
should be certain and vain yes. Oh, whoever could 
believe this and pray in such faith, how blessed 
would be the man to whom God himself is so high 
and dear that he wants to hear his prayer and do 
what he asks. O Lord! Help our unbelief. Amen. 
Martin Luther, D. 1544. 


Maith. 7, 8. 


He who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and 
to him who knocks it will be opened. 


It would not be a miracle, and should be, that a 
Christian would listen to God all hours with prayer, 
and not let him go, because he lets himself be heard 
so graciously, and listens to us without ceasing, and 
says: Ask, seek, knock. Oh, that we were so diligent 
to pray (at least with sighing of the heart), as God is 
with charms, allurements, commands, promises and 
needs for prayer. Ah, we are too lazy and ungrateful. 
God forgive us for that and strengthen our faith, 
amen.

do not lie to us, nor do we lack. He gives an example 
of the Father and the Son, which we should be 
ashamed of, all those who do not like to pray, or who 
doubt that their prayers will be answered. For God is 
kinder to us, and much more inclined to give to us, 
than a human father is to his Son; as follows, v. 11: 
"So then you, who are evil, can give good gifts to your 
children; how much more will your Father in heaven 
give good things (also the Holy Spirit, Luc. 11, 13.) to 
those who ask him." 


Matth. 9, 6. 


But that ye may know that the Son of man hath 
power on earth to forgive sin 2c. 


So that you, dear Christians, do not err like the 
Pharisees and hypocrites, who think that God alone 
forgives sins in heaven, or, as the papists dream, in 
purgatory, outside 1) the earth, you should muck up, 
so that with you, among you, and through you, who 
live on earth, forgiveness of sins may be given and 
received, so that God, who forgives sin, is as close to 
you on earth as God is Creator, who creates, 
sustains, feeds, nourishes and protects on earth. For 
as He creates, sustains, feeds, nourishes, and 
protects you through you, among you, and with you, 
so also He offers grace and forgives sin through you, 
among you, and with all of you who accept and 
believe His word. 

Now if you want to know God, to see God, even to 
grope, see and take care of yourselves. For you are 
God's work, and His works are in you, and among 
yourselves through you, in you. And this | (the Son of 
Man) do through you. For God does not do these 
things presently in His glory or majesty, which it is 
impossible for you to see (for no man shall live who 
thus beholds God), nor by any angels; but the Son of 
Man has power to forgive sin on earth, and after Him 
no man's children for ever, until the day of the blessed 
and glorious coming of the Son of Man come; then 
God Himself, without you, shall be and do all things 
in you, and you all things in Him, amen.

He who receives you receives me; and he who

Help God! What a great, blessed Lord is he who 
gladly hears and reads God's word, that he always 
has such great, glorious guests with him, as the 
Father, Son and Holy Spirit. O cursed unbelief! O 
wretched world! that you despise such guests, even 
persecute them, and instead ask the devil and death 
as guests, yes, want to have them as masters. How 
inexpressible a treasure is _ faith! How 
incomprehensible a pity is unbelief! 


Matth. 10, 41. 


Whoever receives a prophet in a prophet's name 
will receive a prophet's reward. 


There we hear that the Lord wants to have read 
and heard the prophets. He also promises that such 
a one will be like the prophet and will be as good as 
him, both here and there. Here, that he may be made 
a partaker of the prophet's wisdom; there, that he 
may live forever with the prophet and be blessed,

Matth. 11, 6.3) 


Blessed is he who does not take offense at me. 


This is, indeed, a strange trouble, since the world 
is angry with Christ, who raises the dead, gives sight 
to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and preaches the 
gospel to the poor 2c. Whoever thinks such a Savior 
is a devil, what does he want for a God? But there it 
is, he wants to give the kingdom of heaven, so the 
world wants to have the kingdom of earth. He wants 
to give certain, imperishable, eternal, blessed and 
heavenly goods, so the world wants to have earthly, 
perishable ones (since it has more worry and fear 
than pleasure and joy, of which it is not sure for a 
moment). Over it they part, there it is annoying. For

seeks nothing else than earthly honor, fleshly will,

This is: Believe because you have it. If it is taken 
away, you cannot believe, even if you would like to. 
For where the word is taken away, faith cannot 
remain, as we have unfortunately experienced under 
the papacy. 


Matth. 15, 13. 


All plants that my heavenly Father does not plant 
will be eradicated. 


Therefore beware of everything that is not 
certainly the word of God. For it is said: Verbum 
Domini manet in aeternum, that is: God's word 
remains forever, Is. 40, 8. Without doubt, the word of 
man will not remain forever. Because even the pope 
now falls, who is almost as firmly established as the 
devil himself, how much less will other, lesser breeds 
remain. Summa, God's word remains pier and there. 
Whoever believes and hangs on to it, also remains 
here and there. Everything else, as great and holy as 
it may seem, cannot remain, but must perish. This is 
what the Bible teaches us. 


Matth. 17, 5. 


This is what I want you to hear. 

Him alone do we hear, and no other. "The Holy 
Spirit must give us this, or we will do badly in the face

1807 


The commandments must be kept, or there is no 
life, but only death. For even faith is nothing where 
love (that is, the fulfillment of the commandments) 
does not follow, 1 Cor. 13:2. For Christ, the Son of 
God, did not come, nor did He die, that we should 
freely disobey the commandments, but that we 
should fulfill the commandments through His help 
and cooperation. Therefore, as it is said that works 
without faith are nothing, so it is also said that faith 
without fruit is also nothing. For works 2) without faith 
is idolatry. Faith without works is a lie, and no faith at 
all. 


Matth. 21, 22. 
Truly I say to you, whatever you ask in prayer, if you

The same word must also be imposed on God, 
saying: "My God of heaven and earth, you have

the name of Christ, your beloved Son, will be 
granted: | ask and rely on the fact that you will not 
abandon me, and that you will give me true faith, so

granted. One should also pray to God all one's life for 
one blessed hour, amen. 


Matth. 24, 13. 


He who perseveres to the end will be blessed. 


This is found in truth, even in outward things. 
Everyone who diligently waits and works in his state 
of activity will be blessed, rich and happy in the sight 
of the world. It is much more important in Christianity 
(which is a life of the cross, since the devil and the 
world throw many obstacles in the way) to persevere 
to the end, that is, to tear chivalrously through all 
obstacles and troubles, if you are to be blessed in the 
sight of God. For the kingdom of heaven (says Christ 
elsewhere, Matth. 11, 12.) suffers violence, and 
those who do violence snatch it to themselves. 
Therefore a Christian must not only begin in faith, 
hope, love, patience, and continue for a time, but 
also persevere to the end. Otherwise, if all the good 
that one begins were to come to an end, the earth 
would be the kingdom of heaven.

Matth. 24, 15. 


Who ran it, understand it. 


That is, whoever wants to learn the Scriptures 
should understand them. In Hebrew, this means that 
he should pay attention to it. So in German we say: 
Mark what you read; or: If you want to read, mark well 
what you read. For thou readest not the word of man, 
but the word of God, the Most High, who desires to 
have disciples who diligently observe and mark what 
he saith. And if it is well said that one should read the 
letters of princes three times, so that they may speak 
carefully and not be considered fools, how much 
more should one read God's letters, that is, the holy 
Scriptures, three, four, ten, a hundred, a thousand 
and a thousand times. For he speaks thoughtfully 
and importantly; yes, he is the eternal wisdom 
himself. He who does this becomes more learned 
and better from the Scriptures. He who does not, 
learns nothing, even becomes worse from it.

From the Evangelio St. Marci. 
Cap. 10, 14. 7) 


Christ says: 'Let the little children come to me, 
and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of 
heaven. 


You do not baptize infants, as you say, because 
they do not believe: why then do you preach the word 
to the aged, who are without faith, but in time might 
become believers? Surely you do it only because it 
is commanded by God. For if you baptize me so that 
| can say these words, "I believe,” you baptize me in 
nothing else but in myself and in my name. 
Therefore, since you do not know whether the one 
being baptized is a believer or an unbeliever, such 
baptism is only done by God's command or 
commandment. 

For this reason, infants should not be excluded 
from baptism, because, according to common rule or 
command, you should baptize everyone without 
distinction, whether he believes or not,

communicate. It would also be terrible that | should 
be baptized on my confession. And what would you 
do if you secretly knew that he who publicly desired 
baptism or the sacrament was unbelieving? You 
cannot deny it to him, and yet you know that there is 
no faith, just as Christ also administered the 
sacrament to Judas. Therefore, everyone must be 
allowed to come to baptism if he has been publicly 
consecrated, and his faith and salvation must be 
commanded to God. 


From the Gospel of St. Luke. 
Cap. 10, 16. 


He who hears you hears me. 3) 

What an unspeakable grace it is that God speaks 
to us through His word, and speaks so graciously to 
us that He thereby proclaims and announces His 
blessed peace and eternal kingdom to us. O Lord 
God, why are we not proud and hopeful, and boast 
that we hear God speak to us so warmly and kindly, 
of eternal peace, life and blessedness? Oh fie you, 
you shameful, sorrowful unbelief, how you rob us of 
such great glory! O woe to you, damned world, 
eternal, who with hearing ears are deaf, and with 
seeing eyes are blind, and want to be and remain 
willful! 


Luc. 10, 26. 


How is it written in the law? How do you read? 

Here you hear that the Scriptures should and must 
be read in all things. For this reason it is written in 
letters, and kept in the church by God's special 
providence (it will remain in the church until the end 
of the world), so that it may be read, learned, always 
furthered, spread, and brought to children's children 
for and 4) for. Now there are always enough disciples 
or pupils who read and study the Scriptures, and thus 
increase in them, so that in time they also instruct 
others from them.

can. But it is most important that the readers of the 
Scriptures are not only diligent but also faithful. This 
is what the Lord means when he asks: "How do you 
read? What do you teach? As if to say, "See to it that 
you read the Scriptures faithfully and divide the word 
of truth correctly, that is, that you do not seek anything 
else in it for your person except me, without whom no 
one comes to the Father, and teach others from it. For 
many are those who seek their own interests in the 
word, namely how they can gain temporal good and 
honor through it, and have a great reputation in the 
world, "think (as St. Paul says) that godliness is a 
trade", 1 Tim. 6, 5. But woe to such 2c. 


Luc. 11, 28. 


Blessed are those who hear and keep (or retain) 
God's word. 


"Hearing" is a bad thing, "keeping" is a bad thing. 
For one often hears great lies, and keeps them longer 
than all God's words, as the pope's and all the world's 
lies and idolatry have been kept from the beginning. 
But whoever could believe that it is God's word what 
he hears from his pastor or preacher (if he is a 
Christian), and that God humbles Himself so highly, 
who made heaven and earth from nothing, that He 





If we hear his word among us, and after that we 
despise it and become ungrateful, so that we are 
weary of it, like the Jews of the bread of heaven, then 
it is over. Therefore it is not only to hear, but also to 
keep, to remain with it, and not to be forced or torn 
away from it by love or suffering; this is called 
blessed. 


Blessed are those who hear God's word 2c. 


Great grace is it (who has it) to hear God's word. 
For many are those who will not hear it, nor may hear 
it, but persecute and condemn it. But this is the 
greatest grace of all, to keep the word of God. For he 
that keepeth it heareth it without ceasing in his heart, 
and it is his delight that he should hear and speak it 
outwardly. He that keepeth it not, or putteth it out of 
his heart, and forgetteth it, shall not be able to hear it 
long with his ears, but shall soon be full and weary of 
it, as the children of Israel were of the bread of 
heaven. 

So there is a great difference among those who 
hear the word of God. Those keep it and get better 
every day; those leave it out and get worse until they 
fall away and persecute more than those who did not 
want to hear it in the beginning. Therefore it is in 
"keeping" it, that one has desire and love for it. This

when it hears preaching: Oh, that's what the priest

it myself, just as he did. Therefore, God's word is 


men, but the word of God 2c. 
Blessed are those who take GOD's word 2c. 


Many are those who do not want to hear God's 
word, but despise it, even persecute it. Not a few are 


taken for man's word, and everyone becomes tired] those who hear it, but without fruit, because they do 


and full of it. So it follows that they neither want to hear 
it nor keep it. But woe to such clever ones, of whom, 
alas, there are now only very many. 


Blessed are those who hear and keep God's word. 


Consider all the calamities on earth, be it pestilence, 
war, famine, or whatever plague may be, it is nothing 
compared to the misfortune and wrath that God does 
not speak to us, nor let His word be heard. But this is 
still further and unspeakable above, and the last, 
eternal misfortune, when God speaks with us, and 
richly 


not keep it, but let it go in at one ear and out at the 
other. But blessed are they that hear it, and keep it, 
that is, believe it, and do according to it, that is, 
confess it, and keep it, and let no necessity or danger 
of body or goods turn them away from it. 1) "For not 
all," says the Lord in another place, Matth. 7, 21, "who 
say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of 
heaven,’ but those who do the will of my Father in 
heaven." And John 14:21, "He that hath my 
commandments, and keepeth them, the same is he 
that loveth me."

Blessed are those who take GOD's word 2c. 


Great, inexpressible grace is he who may hear 
that God speaks to him. But this is not enough, if one 
does not keep it, and stays with it until the end. Many 
hear the word, but do not believe that God speaks to 
them, but look at the man through whom it is spoken. 
Therefore they do not hold it dear, nor do they keep 
it, but let it go in at one ear and out at the other. They 
do not belong to the number of which the Lord says: 
"Blessed are those who hear the word of God" 2c. 


Blessed are those who take God's word 2c. 


Dear God, through your beloved Son, you blessed 
those who listen to your word. How much more 
appropriate it would be that we, O eternal, merciful 
Father, should blessedly praise you without ceasing 
with a joyful heart, thank you and praise you that you 
show yourself so kindly, even fatherly, towards us 
poor little worms, and speak to us of the greatest and 
highest thing, namely of eternal life and 
blessedness. Nevertheless, you do not neglect to 
entice us kindly through your Son to hear your word 
when he says: "Blessed are" 2c., as if you could not 
do without our hearing, and we, who are earth and 
ashes, do not need your blessed word a thousand 
times more. O how unspeakably great and wondrous 
is thy goodness and patience! Again, alas and alas 
for the ingratitude and blindness of those who not 
only will not hear your word, but also wantonly 
despise, persecute and blaspheme it! 


Luc. 12, 32. 
Fear not, little host, for it is your Father's good 
pleasure to give you the kingdom. 


For if he, the dear Father, should not give it to us, 
we would never buy it from him or earn it. It is give, 
give, give. Therefore we should thank him with a glad 
heart and not boast about our worthiness.

We are nowhere like the apostles, nor will we ever 
be like them. If then they, who had the Lord himself 
present, asked for the strength of faith, how much 
more should we ask for strong faith, even though we 
have the word of Christ in abundance. For there are 
many who are able (as they think they are) to read 
what they read, and yet have no regard for faith. 


Luc. 19, 5.D 
Zachaea, descend with haste, for I must go to your 
house today, 


Zacchaeus was a tax collector, but has a beautiful 
name, which the tax collectors rarely do enough. For 
Zacchaeus is called purus, mundus, as David, Ps. 51, 
6, God speaks purely: Et vincas, id est, mundus sis, cum 
judicaris, that you may be found pure, pious, 
righteous, and innocent when you are judged. For 
God does not want to be, nor can be otherwise, 
without dwelling in the house of Zachaeorum, that is, 
those whom God wants to be pure, and to be right in 
His word. He also considers them to be Zachaeans, 
that is, pure or blameless, because they keep him 
pure and Zachaean in his word, and let him be right. 
For he says, "We are boys and must live by his 
grace. Rom. 3, 4. He alone is righteous, we are all 
sinners. 


Luc. 22, 32. 
The Lord said to Simon, "When you are 
converted, strengthen your brothers. 


From this you see that even weak believers are 
members of Christ and heirs of His eternal kingdom. 
Otherwise the Lord Christ would not have said to 
Petro: "Strengthen your brothers. So also the Spirit 
of Christ teaches through St. Paul, Rom. 14, 1, "that 
one should receive the weak in faith"; item, Cap. 12, 
15, comfort the fainthearted, and "weep with those 
who weep." If the weak in faith were to be rejected,

Thus it is written, and thus Christ had to suffer, 
and rise from the dead on the third day, and preach 
repentance and remission of sins in his name among 
all nations 2c. 

The Scripture, which testifies of Messiah through 
and through, does not say that he should be a world 
king and lord, as the blind fools, the Jews, dream, for 
the devil is also the lord, prince and God of the world, 
but that we should be rid of sin and death, and have 
eternal righteousness, life and blessedness. Such 
things are to be sought and found in the Scriptures. 


From the Evangelio St. Johannis. 
Cap. 1, 14. 


Verbum Caro factum est, hoc est, Deus 
Homo factus est. 


Such a marvelous and overwhelming thing, that 
God became man, teaches this whole and some 
book (the Bible), of which no other book knows 
nothing. For if you do not look for the verbum Caro 
factum est in this book, you would be better off reading 
a Marcolfum or Eulenspiegel. It is all about this 
verbum to do what is created and written. He is the 
Lord, who lies in the manger, and Mary in his arms. 
Whoever does not believe it, this book is of no use to 
him, and he, a Turk or a Papist, may have his 
paradise or kingdom of heaven in hell with all the 
devils. God convert those who are to be converted, 
amen. 


V. 29. Behold, this is the Lamb of God who bears 
the sin of the world. 


| am baptized in the name of Christ, and in his 
death, not in the name of my works, nor of any other 
man, saint, nor angel's work. So Christ, the Son of 
God, not | nor my works, not St. Peter nor an angel, 
was crucified and died for my sin. Thus, 1) John the 
Baptist alone points to Christ.

stum, testifies of him, and says: "Behold, this is the 
Lamb of God, who bears the sin of the world. And 
long before, Isaiah prophesies of Christ (which word 
John the Baptist indicates here) and says Cap. 53, 
11: "He bears their sin"; item, v. 6: "The Lord cast, or 
laid on Him (no one else) all our sin." So that he (as 
Isaiah says further, v. 5, 11) "was wounded for our 
iniquity, and bruised for our sin, and the punishment 
was laid upon him, that we might have peace, and be 
healed by his wounds, and be justified by his 
knowledge." And St. Paul says 2 Cor. 5, 21: "God 
made Him (His only begotten Son), who knew no sin, 
to be sin for us, that we might have in Him the 
righteousness that is before God." And Rom. 8, 3.: 
"God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, 
condemning sin in the flesh through sin" 2c. 

How then should | hand over and let go of Christ, 
my only Comforter and Savior, as these words of 
consolation most lovingly portray Him to me, and not 
accept or take comfort in His name (since no other 
name has been given to us humans, through which 
we can be saved, Apost. 4, 12.), his baptism, his 
suffering, resurrection, victory, merit, 2c. but, as the 
pope teaches through his writers and shouters, to 
rely and build on my good works, or on the excess of 
the monks, 2) or on the intercession and merit of the 
deceased saints? and thus put me, or them, in 
Christ's place, and (if not with words, yet truly with 
deed) say: | am, or they are Christ, and thus rob my 
dear Lord of his office and honor? Then (| would have 
said otherwise) God be for it. For such would be an 
unheard-of idolatry, even among Turks and pagans. 
For if they understood and believed what Isaiah, 
John the Baptist, and all the Scriptures testify about 
Christ, they would certainly not do what the Pope and 
his crowd do, who profess with words that it is right 
and true what the Scriptures say about Christ, 
namely, that he is "God's lamb, which is to be 
delivered to the world”.

He is the Savior of the world, who has redeemed the 
human race 2c., but in fact they deny it. As their 
doctrine of sanctification proves, and also their life 
testifies, which they may keep so holy, and earn so 
much in it (as they unashamedly lie and blaspheme), 
that they may communicate their other merits to 
others. Therefore they are worse than Turks and 
pagans. Moreover, since the Gospel, in praise of 
God, has had its course, and their lies and 
abominations have been revealed and punished, 
pointing us again to God's Lamb, they have made 
every effort to suppress and eradicate it, and to 
reestablish, confirm and defend their old nature and 
status anew. So that they may sufficiently show that 
they deny Christ and his word by deed. 

But let them do so, God will give them such 
happiness to their undertaking that when they will 
say: Now won, peace, peace, there is no more 
danger! they will rise in the abyss of hell. 

Let every one who loves Christ and His Word say 
Amen to this, and pray from the bottom of his heart 
that he may hold fast to John's testimony, believe it 
with certainty, and then go safely on his way, that 
Christ, the Lamb of God, not only bore the sin of 
some people (as Mary, His mother, John the Baptist 
2c., whom He especially loved), but that He also took 
His sin upon Himself, bore it, that is, became a sin 
and a curse for it, and sacrificed Himself for it. 

This is the golden art and the secret hidden 
wisdom of the children of God, which they must know 
and be able to do (because of which they are also 
called Christians and children of God), if they are to 
be otherwise saved. The works saints and belly 
servants know nothing of this, but consider this art 
and wisdom to be the worst heresy and foolishness. 
That is why they persecute it so horribly, blasoheme 
it and condemn it as the devil's doctrine. And in their 
own way, not as Isaiah and John the Baptist preach 
of it, they think to be rid of their sin, and so leave it 
on them, not on Christ, where the Father laid it. But

Joh. 5, 39. (1541,) 1) 


Search (or search) the Scriptures, for ye think ye 
have eternal life therein. And it is she who testifies of 
me. 


This is because we ourselves believe that the Holy 
Scriptures are God's saving Word, which can make 
us eternally blessed, so we should read and study 
them, so that we may find testimony of Christ in them. 
As St. Paul also says Rom. 10, 4: "Christ is the end 
of the law". And Ps. 40, 8: "In the book it is written of 
me" that I, God, shall do your will. 

Whoever does not study the Scriptures, as Christ 
is called here, cannot know anything about eternal 
life. For he lives without God's word, without which 
reason can neither think nor speak of eternal life. But 
whoever studies the Scriptures in such a way that he 
does not find Christ in them cannot attain eternal life, 
no matter how much he learns about it, talks about it, 
2) or even hopes for it, as the Jews do, as St. Paul 
says in Acts 24:14. 24:14, likewise the monks, and all 
those who want to be saved by works. For the 
Scriptures testify of Christ that only he who believes 
in him will be saved. Isa. 53, 6: "God has laid all our 
sins on Him. Item, v. 11: "By his knowledge he, my 
servant the righteous, will do much righteousness" 
2c.

life. But that Christ should be such a life, and that the 
Scriptures should be understood by him, they did not 
want, and still do not want today, to seek another in 
it, which should make them alive and blessed; 
nothing comes of it. It is said, "it (the scripture) is that 
which testifies of me"; | am the same eternal life, 
which one has and finds in the scripture; apart from 
me one does not find life in it, but eternal death. 
Search the Scriptures 2c. 

God has given the holy Scriptures to us poor sinful 
people, that we should not only read them, but also 
(as the Lord says here) search them out, or think 
about them and contemplate them, so that one will 
find eternal life in them. But he that readeth it above, 
and pondereth not continually and more deeply, 
becometh weary of it, and leaveth it aside, as if he 
understood it to the bottom, and findeth nothing in it; 
or becometh a heretic of it, who, like a spider, sucketh 
poison out of the lovely sweet rose, when the little 
bee sucketh sweet honey out of it. 

(1546.)¢ ) 
Search the Scriptures 2c. 

There you have the argument, which you should 
seek and find in the Scriptures: Me, says the Lord, 
you shall learn in it. For even the commandments, the 
histories, the bodily promises, look at last to Christ; 
because nothing can be done, nor asked, nor had, 
but in Christ believed. This is certainly true, and so 
you will find it if you search properly. 

Search the Scriptures 2c. 

We must "seek", he says, not judge; not be 
master, but disciple; not carry our conceit into it, but 
get "Christ's testimony" in it. And as long as Christ is 
not rightly found in it, it will not be rightly sought.

person, both God and man at the same time, that 
whoever does not grasp it from the testimony of 
Scripture through faith must be offended at him. For 
not even the angels can ever be full of wonder. 
Therefore "testimony" is called a speech, which 1) 
one must believe, if one otherwise does not see, 
grasp, nor understand. 


Search the Scriptures 2c. 


"Of me," says Christ, "this is, verily, so. For 
whoever reads the Scriptures in such a way that he 
neither seeks nor finds the Son of Mary, Jesus of 
Nazareth, Son of God and Messiah, in them, it is of 
no use to him that he reads and knows everything 
else. Si Christum bene scis, satis est, si caetera nescis. 


Suchet itt of writing 2c. 

"Eternal life" is testified in the Scriptures, and such 
testimony is "from me", Mary's Son. So it must be 
certain that | am the same eternal life, which is, true 
man and God, promised to you by the Scriptures. 
Here let us search, here we will find everything. 


Search the Scriptures 2c. 


No book teaches about eternal life, that is, about 
Christ, the Son of God, without the Holy Scriptures 
alone. All other books teach mortal beings, even as 
they are best. 


Search the Scriptures 2c. 
Whoever wants to know God and have eternal life 


should read this book (the Bible) diligently and seek 
testimony of Christ, the Son of God, in it. 


Joh. 8, 25. 


Who then art thou? And Jesus said to them: First of 
all, he who speaks to you. 


They want to know first who he is and not pay 
attention to what he says; so he wants them to hear 
first and then they will know who he is. It is said, hear, 
and let the word be the beginning, and knowledge 
shall follow. But if you do not hear, you will never 
know anything. For it is decided that God wants to be 
unseen, unknowable, unapprehended, without any 
one.

through his word. Therefore, whatever one does for 
salvation is in vain, except for his word. He will not do 
it, he will not have it, he will not suffer it otherwise. 
Therefore let his book, in which he speaks to you, be 
commanded to you. For he did not leave it written in 
vain, that it should lie there, as if he talked with the 
mice under the bench, or with the flies on the pulpit. 
2) Let Alan read it, think it, speak it and do it, and be 
sure that he himself (not angel nor creature) speaks 
to us in it. 


Joh. 8, 31. 


If you abide in my speech (or teaching), you are my 
true disciples, and you will know the truth, and the 
truth will make you free. 


This is the freedom of the disciples of Christ, who 
know the truth and abide in it, that they may be free 
and secure from the devil, from death, from hell, and 
from all evil. This may be called freedom, being sure 
and certain of eternal blessedness, having a good 
happy conscience here and there; this may be called 
and be a noble, highborn, rich and great Lord. 


John 8:44. 3) 


You do your father's (the devil's) work; he is a 
murderer from the beginning, and is not established 
in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he 
speaketh lies, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, 
and a father of them. 


From this it follows that the devil, a liar from the 
beginning, also always starts with lies, 


2) Pulpet = desk. 

3) Luther wrote the interpretation of this passage in a book for 
"Master Peter, Balbier", for whom he wrote "Eine einfaltige Weise zu 
beten" in 1534 (St. Louis Edition, Vol. X, 1394). From his table 
companions Cordatus and Schlaginhanfen it has been handed down 
to us in two different relations. The relation of Cordatus we have 
already included in our edition, vol. XXII, 736; the Scblaginhaufens, 
which is found in the old table speeches, Cap. 24, s 60, we offer here, 
improved after the "Tischreden Luthers aus den Jahren 1531 und 
1532 nach den Aufzeichnungen von Johann Schlaginhaufen, aus 
einer Munchener Handschrift herausgegeben von Wilhelm Preger. 
Preger's remark (p. 49): "Cordatus No. 657 according to 
Schlaginhaufen" we consider to be erroneous.

how he seduced Adam and Eve with lies. After the lie 
he brought them to death. And soon after that he also 
made Cain slay his brother. His rule is like this: 
wherever he goes, he sows lies and deceives people. 
Then he does not celebrate, he also commits murder 
and riot and disobedience. Third, when he has brought 
the people into murder and calamity, he drives them 
on to despair in such sins, until some 1) drown 
themselves, drown themselves, strangle themselves, 
as he did Judah to the traitor, whom he first possessed 
with lies; after that he chased to become a traitor and 
was a murderer of his own Lord Christ. At last he led 
him to despair and hang himself [Matt. 27:5]. 

Beware of him, he is a liar and murderer, whoever 
serves and obeys him in this, he is worthy of him in the 
end, like his servant Judas. But for this Christ is good 
to us, our Savior, who has delivered us from his lies 
and murder and guards us daily. For Christ is the right 
teacher and master, who has the highest testimony 
from the Father, Matth. 17, 5: "This is my son, whom 
you hear" 2c. Mart. Luther. 1529. 2) 


This warning by D. M. Luther rhymed it, together with the interpretation 
of the preceding saying: "You are doing your father's work" 2c., 
and wrote it with his hand in a book for the memory of a pious, 
God-fearing man, who liked to hear God's word and talk about it, 
and was much around the Lord Doctor, on whose diligent request 
he also sent out the fine, useful booklet with the title: A Simple 
Way of Praying 2c. The same man used to talk much and often 
about the devil's cunning and violence, and always said that he 
wanted to write a big book against it, so that everyone would 
know to beware of it 2c. 

On this goes the interpretation of this saying and the following rhymes. 
And truly (that to wonder well), as the warning reads, so it 
happened with the same person. For not much more than a year 
later °) 


1) Here we have retained with the old table speeches, with the 
Wittenberg, the Jena edition and Cordatus "sich etliche" instead of: "sie 
endlich" with Schlaginhaufen. 

2) The year "1529" added by Schlaginhaufen cannot possibly be 
correct (see the following note), unless we are dealing here not with an 
inscription, but with a table speech, which one cannot well assume in 
view of the testimony of the old editions. This inscription will have to be 
placed in the year 1534. 

3) The words "not much more than a year after" are to be 
understood in any case in such a way: not much more than a 
year after Luther wrote this interpretation and warning into a 
book for the master Peter. Both in the Wittenberg 


the devil has led her into great misery (as many people here in 
Wittenberg are aware), but has finally died in a foreign place 
well and Christian. But because it is a fine Christian warning, 
which every pious heart should have before its eyes, to take 
teaching and comfort from it, against all temptation of the devil, 
itis also put here for the sake of such a cause. 


Warning D. M. Luther. 


A man will not become so sharp, who can 
know the devil well enough. He hangs a slap 
on him, and will not satisfy him, unless Christ 
is at hand, who has turned the game to him; 
otherwise it is truly lost with us, how much we 
men are born. He makes himself too fat and 
too wide, And knows beforehand all that is 
ready, What master Peter 4) now thinks, And 
hard against him is opposed, That he wants to 
write a book big, And not let the devil go. 


as well as in the Jena edition, these words can be found. The "great 
lament" is that Master Peter stabbed his son-in-law Dieterich at the 
table. On September 12, 1538, this death is spoken of as a long ago 
fact. Cf. Tischreden, Cap. 24, § 74. Walch, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XXIl, 
742. The death stroke took place in the week before Easter (Easter in 
1535 fell on March 28) 1535, as we learn from a letter of Veit Dietrich 
to Fesel in Coburg, dated August 22, 1535 (Kolde, Analecta, p. 209). 
At that time, Master Peter was already a very old man. In a letter of 
Franz Burkhardt to Justus Jonas it says (Kolde I. 6.): miseret me senis 
illius, qui jam in decrepita aetate tam gravissime lapsus sit... From 
1502 on, Peter Barbierer visited Leipzig from time to time and stayed 
there with Georg Reich (Seidemann, Leipziger Disputation, p. 100 ff. 
De Wette, vol. VI, p. 712). In 1517, on September 14, Luther sent a 
greeting from him to Christoph Scheurl (De Wette, Vol. |, p. 63). About 
his further fate in life we learn the following from Okennnckor's 
DUesanrus Hieolo“ine of 1544 (N86r. Oresck. V. 180<I. 4°), p. 215 9: 
"nnni 1535 die 30 dul’ in exiliurn rnik-sns 68t Ns6i8t6i* peter palbirer." 
The same date is found in Ood. Nun. I‘nt. 967. 63. This date, says 
Kolde I. e. p. 210, can hardly be correct according to the above letter 
of Veit Dietrich. - July 30, 1535 was a Friday; on a Friday the public 
court over Master Peter took place. Perhaps therefore the letter of 
Burkhardt, which reports this, is written on Wednesday, July 28. The 
error would not be to be looked for approximately in the dates 
objected to by Kolde, but in the Datirung of Dietrichs letter. Should not 
perhaps dw Xprili8 22 Vn. 1535 should be read instead of: dis 
XnA118ti 6t6.?

He thinks: I'm not so afraid this time of such a |We should believe that we should live eternally, if it 


new fairy tale; I've probably seen it so badly 
anyway, before him | will also still stand. | 
remain a prince of the world, even if you 
Christians do not like it. The great crowd 
stands with me, According to your will little 
goes, And whoever there wants, let him show 
me, If perhaps a man has grown, How holy, 
wise and great he is, Who before me would 
live free, And without harm escape me, Unless 
one or four, who is not called Master Peter, 
What does it matter, my kingdom keeps the 
most? So defiant is the devil, full of all 
roguishness, trickery and cunning, That 
Master Peter may well watch in the matter 
sharply, That he does not show him a trick, 
And also bring him into great misfortune. He 
has done it to many more people than anyone 
can ever count. Therefore, it is time to pray, 
the devil is full of wrath and envy. 


Joh. 8, 51. (1545.) 1) 


Verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man keep my 
word, he shall not see death for ever. 


This word cannot be understood by the law; for 
the same word (as the Lord speaks Joh. 7, 19.) no 
one keeps; yes, it kills, says St. Paul, Rom. 7, 11. Gal. 
3, 10. but his word, of which he speaks here, is the 
word of faith. For though faith be small and weak, yet 
it keepeth this word; and therefore it is not only 
possible, but also easy and good to keep. But the law 
is not only difficult, but also impossible to keep. For 
the hands of Moses are heavy, that stones must be 
laid under them: but the hands of Christ are so light, 
that they draw out dead men, and set them over 
themselves. 


Verily, verily, I say unto you 2c. 


Alas, that the Son of God must swear so dearly, 
for the sake of our lazy hearts, to 


1) This year is only in Walch. 


would be fair and enough, when he alone spoke a bad 
word. Yes, we should ask him to wave only one finger. 
O unbelief! O original sin! that you should make it so 
hard to believe, even among the saints, so many 
books, so many miracles, so precious oaths. Where 
will they go who despise, persecute, blaspheme, 
desecrate such an oath and pledge of God? O pope! 
O Mahomet! O devil! How will you fare? 


He who keeps my word 2c. 


This may be called a good apothecary, who can 
give such medicine that death shall not only be 
overcome, but shall also never be seen. And it is a 
marvel that a man must die and yet not see death, if 
he has God's word in his heart and believes it. 

Such a strong medicine is God's word, kept in 
faith, that it turns death into eternal life. O who could 
believe this, how blessed he would be, even here in 
this life! 


He who keeps my word 2c. 


This must be an excellent, almighty medicine, 
which can heal such a great damage as death so 
easily that it should not be seen anymore. If the world 
believed this, it would tear itself apart for the word of 
God. But because it despises it so shamefully, it is 
certain that it does not believe it, and holds it much 
more powerless than a fly. 


(1544.)?) 
He who keeps my word 2c. 


He who shall not see death, of course, shall not 
see sin. He that shall see no sin shall see all grace 
and righteousness. He who sees grace is blessed and 
sees eternal life. Thus it follows that whoever believes 
and keeps Christ's word, heaven is open to him, hell 
is closed to him; the devil is also caught, sin is 
forgiven, and he is a child of eternal life. This is what 
this book, the Holy Scriptures, teaches, and no other 
book on earth. Therefore, whoever wants to live 
eternally should study it diligently. He who does not, 
nor wants to, is and remains in eternal death. 


2) This year is only in Walch. 


1826 En. 52, 360-362. 


He who keeps my word 2c. 

Oh God! Whoever could believe this, how dear the 
Holy Scriptures would be to him. 

Look at how precious and dear one has the art 
that can cure a fever or pestilence, how everyone 
runs, runs, gives, does, suffers for it. But the treasure 
and the jewel, which takes away death with all 
diseases, misery and distress, no one respects, or, 
unfortunately, very little. And yet the high eternal 
truth, God himself, is praised forever, amen. 

He who keeps my word 2c. 

Without doubt again: Who does not keep my 
word, he must see the death eternally, that is, 
experience. But whoever dies in such a way that he 
does not see, feel or experience death, death is like 
a sleep to him. This is a great wonder and power of 
divine word. "To hold" here means to believe and not 
to doubt; that is a right holding. 

He who keeps my word 2c. 

All the world fears death, and yet despises this 
blessed remedy against it, namely God's word. How 
can this be? The world does not want to and cannot 
believe that God's word is God's power. For it looks 
with beastly eyes at the letters or the oral 
reverberations, does not think that something more is 
behind them, especially such great power of God. 

But whoever believes, as St. Paul says Rom. 1, 
16, that God's word is God's power, would hold it 
dear. For death, which he otherwise cannot escape 
without God's word, would teach him well. 

He who keeps my word 2c. ') 

We must die and suffer death; but this is a miracle, 
that he who keeps God's word shall not feel death, 
but shall pass away as in a sleep. And shall now no 
longer be called, | die, but, | must sleep. But whoever 
is found apart from the word must die with fears, and 
to be eternally ruined and damned, nothing helps. 
Therefore, the best thing is not to argue at all, but to 
speak with all your heart. 


1) This interpretation is also found in Aurifaber's Table Talks, Cap. 
48, § 19. In our edition of the Table Talks, this section is omitted.

1827 


Hearts: | believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God; | 
know nothing more, nor do | want to know more. 


He who keeps my word 2c. 

We must see death with our bodily eyes, for we 
see people dying and being buried; so we must also 
leave when our hour comes, for nothing will change. 
But if a heart takes hold of God's word, and has faith 
in it, the word is so strong and powerful that death is 
not felt in the heart, and thus falls asleep without fear 
or worry. 


So someone my word 2c. 

If this is true, then God's word must certainly be 
an inexpressible, precious, blessed remedy and 
purgation, if it has the power to sweep death out of 
body and soul, which devours all wager. But whoever 
despises this medicine, or is disgusted by it (as the 
blind, crude world does), cannot be helped and must 
remain eternally in death. God protect us from this by 
His holy word, amen. 


So someone my word rc. 2) 

How great and mighty a thing is a Christian who 
believes! Death, sin and the devil must also give way 
to him, and he also sees eternal life here in this time. 
This is what Christ, the Son of God, does, in which 
word he believes. Therefore, a Christian in this rhyme 
should: 

I'm alive, and | don't know how long, 

| must die, don't know when, I'll go from then, 
don't know where, I'm surprised that I'm so cheerful, 
change the last two verses, and rhyme so with a 
cheerful mouth and heart: 

I'm going, and | know, praise God, where to, I'm 

surprised that I'm so sad. 


2) In the royal library in the Royal Palace in Stockholm, one has 
the Vulgate, which Luther once used and provided with marginal 
glosses and a long postscript. Among other sayings, this one is said 
to be there: 

| live and know well how laug. 

I'm dying and | think | know when. 

I'm going and | think | know where I'm going. 

lam surprised that | am not always cheerful. 
The verses are old and not from Luther. "SeidemaunDe Wette, Vol. 
VI, p. 431.) - Compare St. Louis edition, Vol. X, 1060, where these 
verses also occur, likewise Vol. VII, 1883. 


1828 


It would be good for impenitent, secure people to 
have this rhyme, as it has been from time 
immemorial, always before their eyes, whether they, 
reminded by it, wanted to become wise, that is, to 
strike within themselves and consider that they were 
mortal and not secure of their life for a moment, and 
thus would be moved to fear God, to repent, and to 
mend their ways. As Moses in his Psalm earnestly 
exhorts all the children of Adam to pray to God in this 
way: "Teach us, O Lord, to remember that we must 
die, that we may become wise" [Ps. 90:12]. 


So someone my word will 2c. 


The more firmly you hold, and the less you doubt, 
the less you will feel death, that is certain. The 
weaker you hold, the more you doubt, the more you 
also feel death; that is not lacking. O Lord, strengthen 
our faith, and it will be won and well kept. 


Never see death again, ') 


How unbelievable this is said, and contrary to 
public and daily experience; nevertheless, it is the 
truth. If a man seriously considers God's word in his 
heart, believes it, and falls asleep or dies over it, he 
sinks and passes away before he understands or 
becomes aware of death, and has certainly passed 
away blessed in the word which he thus believed and 
considered. 


Joh. 8, 51. 
He who keeps my word will never see death. *) 


1) About this it is said in the report "vom christlichen Abschied 
Luthers aus diesem tédlichen Leben," Jenaer Ausgabe, Vol. VIII, Bl. 
386 (Walch, alte Ausg., Vol. XXI, 289%, § 26): "dass dies die letzte

Rentmeister, zukommen, vorn in einer Hauspostille." - "Under yours 
was written: Martinus Luther, Doctor. 1546. Done on the 7th day of 
Februarii.". Walch makes the remark without doubt about this 
interpretation): "The original is to be found hei Herrn Sigismundo 
Abessern, Superintendent at Kénigsberg in Franconia." The words of 
Walch are also significant: "Another beautiful interpretation of the 
previous words is to be found below in the report of the Christian 
departure of D. M. Luther from this mortal life", because there is the 
same interpretation as here.

1829 


We all have to die, but woe to those who have to 
see death! God's word helps against this, which, if 
one keeps or believes it, nullifies death altogether, 
and death must die before it, and life must remain 
forever. For the word shows death and the devil an 
image, that is, Jesus Christ, from which he must flee 
and disappear. For he has nailed him to the cross 
through his cross. Praise be to God, amen. 


John 8:51. °) 


Whoever has my words will not see death for eternity. 


Dear, who believes such things to be true? We 
have and hear the word, but if we believed it, we 
would already be blessed. For he who never sees 
death, though he dies and decays, yet lives and 
knows nothing of death, as the Lord says here, and 
does not lie. The wretched unbeliever is a liar. God 
bless him, amen!

Joh. 10, 27. 


My sheep know me, and they hear my voice. 


The two follow each other. He that heareth Christ 
heareth him again; for they know one another. 
Therefore, if anyone wishes to pray that he will surely 
be heard, let him first hear Christ and believe his 
voice, and all will be well. 


Joh. 10, 28. 
My sheep will never perish, and no one will snatch 
them out of my hand. 


He may watch and take care where my soul will

own life to redeem my soul. Praised forever be He,

He will not begin to learn from me how to protect 
the blessed who hear and keep his voice from the 
power of the devil and the evil and tyranny of the

do not ask me to take care of my soul and to have it

Joh. 11, 25. 


Iam the resurrection 2c. 


How great is the faith that grasps the word of God 
and keeps it. And yet it can be seen that nothing is 
more powerless and weaker than the word and faith. 
But it is God's way to prove His power and wisdom 
through weakness and foolishness, and to disgrace 
the power and wisdom of the devil and the world. 


Jn. 11, 25. (1542.)2) 


I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in 
me, though he die, yet shall he live. 


If this is true, a Christian should despise death, or 
at least not fear it so much that he does not despise 
God for its sake. 

But whoever is not afraid of death and does not 
respect God (as the crude world does), this book of 
God is of no use to him.

He does not want to push away the human race, 
even though it is miserably burdened (oppressum) 
with the greatest sins and misdeeds and deserves 
the wrath of God, but wants to draw it from the earth 
to Himself. Thus he hangs on the cross with 
outstretched arms (manibus), as if he wanted to call 
us to him with the words written in Matth. 11, 28: 
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, 
and | will give you rest." Therefore we should learn to 
take refuge in Christ, to ask him for help against sin 
and eternal death, so that we may expect our 
deliverance in firm faith. M. Luter. 


John 12:35. 
Walk while you have the light, so that the darknesses 


do not overtake you. 


Who believes more and more that such 
seriousness is, of which Christ speaks here? How 
little do we esteem this light, and think that we can 
still get it if we want to, even if we do not accept it 
now. But he says, "No, but he who despises it is 
seized by darkness. 

Fronte capillata, post haec occasio calva. 


V. 35: He who walks in darkness does not know 
where he is going. 


Many fine people, both in monasteries and 
outside, who were serious about becoming pious and 
blessed, experienced this with their great damage, 
yes, loss of property, body and souls, under the 
troublesome papacy, which made it sour on both 
sides; the latter with so much fasting, watching, 
praying, singing, reading, etc., that some of them lost 
their senses over it, that some of them went out of 
their minds, some weakened their bodies so much 
that they had to die the sooner; those with invocation 
of the saints and visiting their places, saying various 
little prayers, also with much giving to maintain and 
increase idolatry and false worship in monasteries, 
foundations 2c., and to supply their idolaters 
abundantly 2c., all in the opinion and hope as if they 
would certainly thereby appease God's wrath, obtain 
forgiveness of sins, and earn heaven. And yet they 
were nothing else than walking in darkness and 
missing the way. Therefore, all the effort and work, 
all the doing and suffering, all the giving and giving,

shine, there can be nothing but darkness, error and 
destruction. That is why the. Therefore the Lord says: 
"lam the light of the world. "Walk while ye have the 
light, that the darknesses overtake you not, for the 
night cometh, wherein it is impossible to work, John 
8:12, 35, Cap 9:4. 


John 13:35. 


Thereby everyone will know that you are my 
disciples, if you have love! among yourselves. 


It is not possible that he should hate his neighbor 
who loves to hear and read his word and teaching. 
Again, it is also impossible that he should be Christ's 
disciple, or be taught by His word, who does not love 
his neighbor, because the Master teaches and gives 
such love; therefore he must be the devil's disciple. 


Joh. 14, 1. 2. 
Do not let your heart be troubled 2c. In my 
father's house are many dwellings. 


Here the Lord himself commands us to be of good 
courage and not to be afraid. For we know where we 
are to stay, we must not worry about lodgings or 
dwellings; they are already prepared and waiting for 
us when we are to depart. Give us grace, dear Lord, 
that we may believe, amen. 


Let not your heart be troubled. If you believe in 
God, you also believe in me. In my father's house 2c. 


The father himself has ordered you lodging, so do 
not be alarmed. And even if he had not ordered it, | 
would order it soon and come to you again. The Lord 
2) wants to make it clear, as he does in this chapter 
and often in the Gospel of St. John, that he is like the 
Father, and that the Father does nothing that he, the 
Son, does not do in the same way. Therefore he also 
says: "If you believe in God, you also believe in me. 
But it is very comforting that he does not only comfort 
them about the dwelling place, that it is already 
prepared, but also promises them, v. 3. 


1) Wittenbergers and Jenaers: dear to you. 
2) Erlanger: "he" instead of: The HErr. 


Take them to him, that they may be where he is. Let 
this be your comfort in all trials and tribulations, and 
hold fast; it is for a little while, and he will come and 
deliver you, and take you to himself, that you may be 
where he is; and he will make you glad of your 
affliction. 3) So come, dear Lord, soon, and do not 
consume, amen. 
Joh. 14, 1. 


If you believe in God, you also believe in me. 


Why and before whom should you or would you 
fear, if | am the very God in whom you believe when 
you believe in God; and cannot lack God when you 
believe in me? Now | am a right man, like unto you, 
before whom ye must not fear, but am my good 
friends; in turn | also am your good friend. So you 
must not be afraid of God either, as good friends are 
not afraid of good friends, but take comfort in him, 
and all good things, in all accidents, are provided for 
him. For it is said: Et Verbum caro factum est, God 
became man. 


Do you believe in GOD 2c. 


Since Christ is not angry with us, but also dies for 
us, surely God cannot be angry with us, for he, 
Christ, is God. Whoever believes in him, believes in 
God. O blessed would be he who did not doubt this. 


Joh. 14, 6. 
Christ. I am the life and the truth. 
As | go, so shall it go, and shall go right, and shall 
stay that way. 
Devil. I am death and lies. 


If you doubt this, hold the chair of Rome against 
God's word; the [word] does not deceive you and is 
old enough to be believed. 


I am the way, and the truth, and the life. 
That is cut short, and straight condemns all ways, 
doctrine and life that are not

1835 





Christ is called. Therefore all who are in the papacy, 
from top to bottom, must go to hell. For it is evident 
that theirs is not Christ, nor truth, but lies, error, and 
death. Therefore they cannot come to the Father, that 
is, to the kingdom of heaven. 


I am the way, and the truth 2c. 


He who does not go this way must miss and go 
astray. He who does not obey this truth 1) must lie 
and deceive, and deceive himself and others. He who 
does not have this life must die and perish forever. 
Summa, without me everyone goes to hell and must 
go to the devil. 


V. 10 The words that I speak to you I do not speak 
from myself. But the Father who dwells in me does 
the works. 


That is, if you hear me and my words, you must 
not be afraid of God, my Father, that he will devour 
you like fire (as Moses says), but may boldly and 
confidently think that he himself speaks to you the 
very things you hear from me. For | am the same God 
and Lord with him, and there is no more God who 
speaks to you differently than | do. Therefore do not 
fear me, and love to have me around you; do not fear 
the Father, and love to have him around you. And 
neither flee nor shun him, as little as ye flee or shun 
from me. And pray and speak as confidently with him 
as with me. For | am the Son, He the Father. | do not 
hate you, neither does he; may you speak boldly with 
us 2c. 


Joh. 14, 13. 


Whatever you ask in my name, I will do. 


It is clear that he who worships the Son worships 
the Father. And what the Son gives, the Father gives. 
And the Son's and the Father's honor, gift and work 
are one. 


Joh. 14, 13. 
Whatever you ask in my name I will do, so that the 
Father may be honored in the Son. 


1) Erlanger: does not have the truth. 





Dear, who believes that our prayer is so pleasant? 
But let us pray nevertheless. For weak faith is also 
true faith, and must nevertheless also be heard, so 
that the Father does what we ask of the Son, whom 
we believe to be like God with Him, even though He 
was crucified in weak humanity. That it may be said: 
Homo JEsus Christ is all and everything, and that we 
with Paul know nothing without JEsum Christ 
crucified, 1 Cor. 2, 2. 


V. 21: He who has my commandments and keeps 
them is he who loves me. 


The difference is having God's word and keeping 
it. Many have it, but do not keep it, but keep their 
mammon, honor, power, favor over God's word. 
Therefore they do not love Christ, and deceive 
themselves by knowing that they have the word, and 
hear and read it daily, but do not improve themselves 
by it. 

V. 23 We will come to him and make our home with 
him. 

O faith, faith, how hard it is for you to enter, and 
yet he is an exceedingly blessed man who believes. 
How so? For he is, says Christ, a dwelling place and 
palace of the divine majesty. Again, without 2) doubt, 
he who does not believe is the devil's cave 3) and 
stinking barrel; he will certainly give hospitality to a 
fine host in the abyss of hell. O protect us, dear Lord, 
from unbelief, and strengthen our faith! Amen. 


We will come to him, and apartment 2c. 


If God dwells with him who loves and keeps His 
word, who dwells with him who despises and 
persecutes His word? Protect GOD from this. 

Joh. 14, 24. 


The word you hear is not mine, but the Father's who 
sent me. 


Who believes this? It is true, | hear the word, but if 
| could believe that God Himself is telling me and 
talking to me: Dear, tell me, where would | be before 
great humility? 

2) Erlanger: without all. 


3) Wittenberger and Jenaer: "hnle", which Walch and the Erlanger 
have resolved with "Hille".

dust and ashes, the majesty in heaven itself speaks. 
In hope that such high majesty would not despise to 
look at me /in the muck and stink, yes, even to talk to 
me, and to talk so sweetly and comfortingly. O, cursed

The word you hear 2c. 


And it is indeed a beautiful change: If you hear 
me, | hear you. But if you do not hear me, | do not 
hear you again. One thing after another, as you wish. 

How wretched then are the enemies or despisers 
of the word of God, who have no God; and though 
they pray much, yet he heareth not, Ps. 18:42: "They 


Because the Son speaks so sweetly and lovingly call, but there is no helper; to the Lord, but he heareth

with us. Only believe this firmly and surely. For if the 
Son is for us, who sits at the right hand of God and 
represents us, who can be against us? 


Joh. 15, 3. (1546.)') 

You are now clean because of the word that I have 
spoken to you. 

Both, our life and our work, are unclean because} 
of our person, as long as we live. But if God's word, 
which is pure, yes, purity itself, which cleanses and 
sanctifies everything, remains in us, the same makes 
that not only the remaining sin that clings to us is not 
imputed to us for Christ's sake, but that we are also 
considered and are pure before God. Therefore St. 
Paul also says Titus 1:15: "To the pure," that is, to 
those who have and love God's word and live 
according to it, "all things are pure. But to the unclean 
and unbelieving nothing is pure." 


v. 5. Lam the vine, you are the branches 2c. 


From this it follows that all that is done apart from 
Christ is in vain and lost. For they cannot be branches 
in Christ, but are thorn hedges that belong to the 
hellish fire. 


Joh. 15, 7. (1543.) 
If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, youl 
will ask whatever you want, and it will be done to you. 


This is and is called a great glory and freedom, that 
we may pray to God confidently and boldly, and all 
things shall surely come to pass. 


1) This year is only in Walch. 


If you remain in me 2c. 

For where one hears, reads, speaks or thinks the 
Word of God (with earnestness), there is certainly the 
Master and Teacher of the same Word, that is, the 
Holy Spirit. One may well thank God for such a gift. 
There one can pray and live rightly, there everything 
is heard and everything is well done. The Word does 
not allow anything to go wrong. And even if it were 
out of ignorance or weakness, if one stumbles, it will 
be remedied, and through prayer it will be well again. 
Therefore, one should gladly hear God's word, read 
it, learn it, "consider it diligently," and hold fast to it, 
as he says: "Blessed are those who hear God's word 
and keep it." 

If you remain in me 2c. 

It is a great power that we may ask what we want, 
and it must be certain and yes. But first the word must 
be there and remain in us, otherwise the request is 
in vain and nothing. But the word does not let us ask 
anything that is against God and the salvation of our 
souls. For this is why it was given to us, that we might 
be saved through it, Rom. 1, 16. Blessed is he who 
believes; woe to him who does not. 

If you remain in me 2c. 

This is what matters, 2) that we abide in him. This 
happens if his words remain in us, that is, if we keep 
them in 3) right faith, and thus live by them. In this 
way, everything is possible, and everything we ask 
for will 4) certainly be answered. 

If you remain in me 2c. 

There it is, and it is certain: Whoever hears God's 

word, God wants to hear him again. That is why 
2) Erlanger: only.

1839 





Those who do not pray, or must pray in vain, will be 
condemned along with their prayers, those who 
despise God's word, and many more who persecute 
it. But let him who respects and honors it lift up his 
eyes and hands to heaven with joy, and let him pray 
confidently and without fear. For he is heard, there is 
no doubt about it, as the Lord says here, who is the 
truth and cannot lie. O pray whoever can, all is heard 
to him who hears God's word and believes. 


If you remain in me 2c. 


How great is the glory of a Christian, that if he 
believes God's word (with earnestness) and sticks to 
it, he has done God's will and pleasure. Therefore, 
God will again do what He wants and asks. If you 
remain steadfast in the word of God, God will remain 
steadfast in your prayer. 


If you remain in me 2c. ') 


Wonderful thing, who makes himself obedient to 
God and His word, God wants to make himself 
obedient to him again. Whoever obeys his father and 
mother, God will hear him again when he asks and 
calls to Him in his distress. But he who does not listen 
to his father and mother, God will not listen to him 
again when he cries out in his distress. For He will 
have obedience over all sacrifices and worship. 


Joh. 15, 8. 
In this my Father is honored, that you bear much 
fruit, and become my disciples. 


If we remain disciples of our Lord Christ, and 
become disciples of no other master, and do not want 
to hear, learn or know anything other than his word 
alone, our preaching will produce much fruit. From 
this, then, comes all honor, praise and thanksgiving 
to God the Father, and not our own honor and praise. 
For he wants to be with us through the word of Christ 
alone, and work our salvation. 


Joh. 16, 11. 
For judgment; for the prince of this world is 
judged. 


1) In the old edition of Walch this interpretation is duplicated, the 
first time with the heading (Joh. 14, 23.): "Whoever loves me will keep 
my word. We have omitted it from John 14 because the Wittenberg 
and Jena editions also place it there. The Erlangen edition, however, 
has it under Joh. 14. 





The world condemns the Word or the doctrine of 
faith. The devil arouses much trouble through heresy. 
So we are also still weak. By these three things the 
judgment of the world is strengthened, as if it were 
right, and we gain the reputation of being the wrong 
ones, and so wrong; but against this Christ comforts 
us, saying that this judgment is condemned with its 
prince. Therefore neither the multitude or violence of 
tyrants, nor the dreams of heretics, nor the 
foolishness or weakness of believers, shall move us 
to doubt the truth of this doctrine. For it is written: 
"You will be right when you are judged", Ps. 51, 6. 
This judgment must be against the word in the world; 
but much more it must be overcome and condemned 
by God. 


Verily, verily, I say unto you 2c. 

This much is said: You cannot stand before God 
my Father with your purity or worthiness, therefore 
you need a mediator and high priest. Flee therefore 
unto me, and doubt not that ye have pleased God for 
my sake. 


Joh. 16, 27. 
He himself, the Father, loves you, because you love 


me. 


Whoever has been given this grace by God, that 
He is pleased, delighted, loved and rejoiced that the 
Son came forth from the Father and came to us in the 
world, that He redeemed us from the devil's power, 
sin and eternal death, let him thank God with a joyful 
heart, and know that this is the joy and pleasure of 
which the angelic hosts sing about the blessed birth 
of the Lord Christ, and which we human beings 
desire with all our hearts. 


(1544.)?) 
V. 33. Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

which the LORD has made, let us rejoice and be glad 
in it. If God is for us, who will be against us? 


Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. 


Here it is clear that Christ did everything and 
suffered for us. For he does not say, "Be of good 
cheer, for you have overcome the world; but this is 
your consolation, that |, | have overcome the world. 
My victory is your salvation, believe it. 


Be of good cheer, I have 2c. 


Who can be afraid of him who is overcome, bound 
and imprisoned? He may rage, do abominable things, 
bite the chains and gnash his teeth, but he can do no 
harm except to himself. So the world, the devil, sin 
and death are also to be seen by us Christians, for 
they are overcome. O Lord, help us to believe, amen. 


Be of good cheer, I have 2c. 


Ah! Who could believe this, how blessed such a 
soul would be. For when the world is overcome, what 
can it do? What can its god and prince, the devil, do? 
But if 1) the world is nothing, then its god and prince 
is also nothing. He may strangle the body, steal honor 
and goods; but with this he must be our submissive, 
unwilling servant for our good and eternal life; that is 
what he gets. 


Joh. 17, 17. 
Sanctify them in your truth. 

Notice that nothing is holy before God, but 
everything is sinful and condemned that man lives 
and does without God's word. Again, nothing is so 
unholy and terrible that it cannot be made right, holy 
and worthy by God's Word. Just as the death of the 
faithful, who are sanctified by the Word, is considered 
worthy and precious in the sight of God, who is 
otherwise terrible beyond measure to all the world. 


Your word is the truth. 

If this is true, then everything must be untruth 
where God's word or truth is not. That is why it is 
terrible when a person is without God's word or 
despises God's word. 


1) "but" is missing in the Erlanger. 


For he must live in the damned being, of which he is 
not sure for a moment. See how the world is such a 
wretched, miserable, desperate thing, where there is 
no truth, no God, no life, but vain lies, death, devils 
and all misfortune, hidden under a slight appearance 
or shadow; yes, it is rather a mere dream and sleep, 
as Moses says in his Psalm, Ps. 90, 5: Fluctuasti eos, 
somnus sunt, they go by like a stream, they sleep. Who 
believes this? Oh, how can they believe because 
they sleep? 


Your word is the truth. 2) 


There is no one so rude nor so foolish who would 
gladly and willingly allow himself to be deceived, 
especially in great, serious matters, where everyone 
wants the truth and does not want to suffer lies. It 
follows from this that people who despise God's 
word, the blessed truth, must not be foolish, but 
foolish and superfoolish. For if they were serious 
about having the truth and not suffering lies, they 
would seek and hold God's word differently and 
higher than the true truth of God. 


From the stories of the apostles. 
Cap. 10, 43. 
All the prophets bear witness to this 2c. 
Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, speaks before 
the Gentiles in the house of Cornelii the warrior, in 


the name of all the apostles, invoking all the 
prophets. Let this be a concilium for me. 


From the Epistle to the Romans. 
Cap. 1, 16. 
God's word is God's power, which makes blessed 
all who believe in it. 


It is not the power of the word that is lacking, but 
the unbelief that doubts it, or 


2) This interpretation of the saying is once again Walch, old 
edition, Vol. XXI, 1596, provided with the year 1542 and the remark 
that the same was written by Luther in a Bible, which is printed in 
Wittenberg in 1541. The text there is somewhat changed, but this, 
which the Wittenberg and Jena editions offer, seems to be the more 
original. - Seidemnan has overlooked that the text printed by him in 
De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 342, is already found here.

does not firmly believe in it. Otherwise, if one (firmly) 
believes in it, blessedness is already there and has 
begun, and death with sin, along with the devil and 
hell, has already been overcome and swallowed up 
in the blood and death of Christ, as He says John 
16:33: "Be of good cheer, | have overcome the world. 
Without doubt the prince of the world, with sins and 
death to boot. 1) 


God's word is God's power. 


Without doubt, our works will not be such power, 
for they are not the word of God, nor faith. 


Rom. 1, 17. 
The righteous will live by his faith. 


The prophet agrees with Moses when he says 
Deut. 8:3: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by 
every word that proceeds from the mouth of God," for 
it is called faith, not the mere knowledge of history, 
but the certain confidence in God's mercy, which God 
promises us for Christ's sake in a fine word, which is 
a power of God that makes blessed all who believe in 
it. Accordingly, the same word, accepted and 
grasped with faith, makes a new man, inwardly and 
outwardly, in body and soul. And then follow the 
words of St. Paul: "If a man believes with his heart, 
he is justified; and if he confesses with his mouth, 2) 
he is saved. Rom. 10, 10. So that all things are 
possible to him that believeth, Marc. 9, 23. For the 
word on which he hangs is almighty. 


Rom. 3, 21. 


But now, without the help of the law, the 
righteousness that is valid before God is revealed and 
attested by the law 2c. 


Without law, but by grace we are justified. But 
such grace bears witness to the law. It is the same 
with John the Baptist, without whom we must become 
Christians. But Christ must be witnessed and shown 
to us through him. 


1) The following words, which are printed separately from the 
preceding in the editions, make up a whole with the same. 

2) The words: "so one is justified... bekennet" are missing in the 
Erlanger. 


Rom. 4, 25. 


Christ was given for our sins and raised for our 
righteousness. 


Here is the glory and comfort taken from those 
who want to make themselves blessed by God 
through merit. For since such a death had to happen 
for our sin, which is called Jesus Christ's death, and 
such a resurrection had to happen, which is also 
called Jesus Christ's resurrection, it is good to reckon 
that either our merit is nothing and lost, or Christ's 
death and resurrection is of no use and in vain. God 
be thanked for that, amen. 


Rom. 8, 31. 
Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos? 


If we could decline and understand the pronoun nos 
and nobis, we would also conjugate the noun Deus, and 
make a verbum out of the nomon, so that it would be 
called Deus dixit, et dictus est: then the praepositio contra 
would be disgraced, and finally become an infra nos, 
as it will and must happen, amen. 


Rom. 10, 15. 


How lovely are the feet of those who proclaim 
peace, who proclaim good. 


How heartily we should give thanks that we are 
worthy to hear and read what such lovely and 
comforting preachers say and write to us about the 
peace and comfort that is proclaimed to us through 
them. Many kings and prophets have desired to see 
and hear it, but have not seen and heard it. 


How lovely are the feet of those who proclaim 
peace, who proclaim good. °) 


St. Paul himself interprets peace and good as 
eternal peace and comfort, that is, forgiveness of sins 
and eternal life in Christ. But Caiphas and Annas, 
Pabst and their scales, did not understand it. 

Martinus Luther, D. 1545. 


3) This saying is in Luther's handwriting on the inside of the cover 
of a German edition of Melanchthon's 4,oei from 1544, which is in the 
monastery library at Mayhmgeu, but as belonging to Is. 52, 7. (Erl. 
Ausg., vol. 56, p. HX1II.)

Rom. 14:7-9. 


None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to 
himself. If we live, we live to the Lord. If we die, we 
die to the Lord. If we live or die, we are the Lord's. 
For to this end Christ died, and rose again, and is 
alive again, that he might be Lord over both the dead 
and the living. 


Why then are we so afraid of death, which is only 
an entrance for us into eternal life? For as long as we 
live in this maggot sack, we are strangers in the 
devil's inn. But as soon as we come out of this life, 
we go to heaven, to our eternal fatherland, for which 
we have a heartfelt desire and longing every 
moment, 2 Cor. 5:2. 

So come now the Turk, Pabst, and what evil is in 
the world, they can do us no harm at all. For in 
wanting to harm us, they do us the greatest service, 
and help us to an eternal crown. For he is blessed 
who dies in the faith of Christ. But he is much more 
blessed who dies for the faith of Christ. 


Rom. 14, 8. 


We live or die, we are the Lord's. 


Yes, we are the Lord's, and our greatest comfort and 
joy is that we have him for our Lord, to whom the 
Father has given all authority in heaven and earth, 
and all things into his hand: who then will and can 
harm us? The devil may be very angry and stab us 
murderously in the heels, but he should not tear us 
out of his hand. Moreover, if we believe in Jesus 
Christ our Lord and live under his protection and 
protection, we ourselves are now masters, through 
him and in him, over the devil, sin and death. 2c. For 
he became man for our sake (that he might bring us 
to such dominion), pleaded with the Father on our 
behalf, and so loved us that he became a curse for 
us, gave himself for us, purchased with his precious 
blood, and washed and cleansed from sins. Item, he 
also gave us the pledge of our inheritance and 
blessedness, the Holy Spirit, into our hearts, to be 
kings and priests before God, and in sum, to be 
children and heirs of God, and 


as his co-heirs. This is certainly true. O Lord, 
strengthen our faith that we may not doubt it. 


Rom. 15, 4. (1541.) 1) 


But the things which are written aforetime are 
written for our learning, that we through patience 
and comfort of the scriptures may have hope. 


That is, the Holy Spirit wanted to write and read, if 
he could have readers and listeners. He wrote to us 
through the prophets; since they could not 
understand it or did not want to read it, he himself 
began to read and teach us through the apostles, so 
that we would understand it. 


But that is the lesson: 


One should read and listen to the Biblia diligently, 
then one will find what is nowhere else to be found, 
namely comfort, but "in patience", that is, in 
distresses of conscience (as the devil drives with 
accusations of sins) and of death (as nature horribly 
scares). There is no other book in heaven and earth 
that tells us how God's Son overcame sin, death and 
the devil for us. And even if there were golden books, 
golden wisdom, golden teachers eternal, it is still 
nothing, where the comfort of this book is not, without 
which ultimately even the patience itself can not 
remain. 


But what written earlier. 


Although the Old Testament was written before, 
and under Mosi's rule, it is still all and everything 
written for the comfort of us Christians. For even the 
terrible histories of God's wrath serve to give us 
comforting hope that God will surely deliver His 
Church from evil men at last, and control their raging 
and fury. The gracious histories are written much 
more for our comfort. 


That through patience we may 2c. 


Patience becomes greater impatience in the end, 
unless the comfort of the Scriptures comes to our aid. 
For we know that God Himself speaks to us in the 
Scriptures.

Erl. 52, 383 f. 


From the first epistle to the Corinthians. 
Cap. 11, 24. 


Take and eat, this is my body. 


The true body and blood of Christ is given to eat 
and drink in the bread and wine. Now a question 
arises: How can Christ be bodily in the Sacrament, 
when One Body cannot be in many places at once? 

From this | answer thus: Christ has said that he 
wants to be there; therefore he is truly in the 
sacrament, and in addition bodily. Therefore he is 
truly present. And no other cause of such bodily 
presence is to be sought than this. The words are 
thus, therefore it must be done as they are. But as far 
as the body is concerned, Christ can be everywhere 
or in all places, if he only wants to be. Therefore it has 
a different opinion with his and our body. 

Of being everywhere, or in all places, is not to be 
disputed. There is much else in this matter; so even 
the school theologians here speak nothing of being 
everywhere, but keep the simple understanding of the 
bodily presence of Christ. 1) 


Cap. 13, 12. 


But if Christ is preached to have risen from the 
dead, how do some of you say that the resurrection of 
the dead is nothing? 


This is the highest and most terrible wrath, when 
God does not give that one hears his word gladly nor 
respects that one may not desire a greater plague.

Contradiction appears. That is why there must be 
faith. Faith will be followed in its time by a righteous 
and manifest vision, when that which is now hidden 
and invisible will become manifest and visible. Thus 
the invisible world has become a visible world. 


From the Epistle to the Colossians. 
Cap. 3, 13. 
May the peace of God reign in your hearts. 

This is faith in the heart, which knows and stands 
firm that one should be obedient to God and expect 
help and comfort from Him. Therefore, he does not 
take revenge, does not repay evil with evil, does not 
cause turmoil or war, but brings it home to God and 
patiently endures it.

Our greatest glory is that we can confidently boast 
that we are disciples of God, as Peter says 2 Petr, sl,

ourselves. For whoever hears the Son according to 
the saying, "Him you shall hear," can hopefully boast 
that he has heard the glory of the Father. Now itis a 
much higher glory to be a hearer of the majesty than 
to be a worshipper. For what the Majesty speaks to 
us is certain. But what we pray cannot always 
happen. Furthermore, what the Majesty speaks 
makes us alive, comforts us, and makes us certain of 
the gracious will of God the Father toward us.

From the first epistle to Timotheum. 
Cap. 2, 4. 
God wants all people to be helped (or to be blessed) 


and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
That is why he gives: 
the sacred scripture, to read; 
the Word, to preach and to hear; 
the dominions to keep peace; 
Parents and schoolmasters, for child rearing; 
Heaven and earth, for nourishment with all that they 
bear and are able to bear. 
On the other hand, the devil does not want one 
person to live or have peace. 
That is why he lets: 
Despise the sacred Scriptures or pervert them 
through rottenness; 
not hear the word nor believe it; 
the gentlemen do not agree; 
Parents and disciplinarians do not teach the children 
nor draw them to godliness and respectability.

1 TiM. 2, 5. 
There is One God and One Mediator between God 
and man, namely the man Jesus Christ, who gave 
Himself for all for salvation. 


If it is for all men, then we certainly belong to it, 
and there must be no lack of salvation. For St. Paul 
speaks this from the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of 
truth. Therefore the fault is in those who do not 
believe nor want to accept it, but either shamefully 
despise it or maliciously persecute it.

1 Tim. 4, 13. 

Stop with reading, with exhorting, with teaching. 

Many are those who think that once they have 
heard or read God's word, they are no longer allowed 
to, and now know it all and everything. These are 
corrupt students of the Scriptures who have never 
really begun and have never tasted anything of the 
Word of God. And thus perish in their surfeit, just as 
the Jews also became full and weary of the manna, 
and grumbled about it, became lustful, and perished. 
It is said: 

Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit. 

That is, the more and more diligently you read 
something, the more you like it, and the more sweetly 
it comes to you. And Sirach says Cap. 24, 28, 29: "He 
who eats of me always hungers for me, and he who 
drinks of me always thirsts for me." And pure animals 
chew the cud. But to chew the cud means to accept 
the Word of God with right earnestness, to take it to 
heart, to have love and desire for it, to consider it 
diligently, and to hold fast to it. This is what the pure 
do, that is, the true Christians, whose hearts have 
been purified by faith in the Word. The others, who do 
not take the word seriously, let it go in one ear and 
out the other, and so remain unclean animals. 

1 Tim. 6, 17. 

God gives us abundantly, all kinds of things to enjoy. 

Remember, our Lord God is pleased that we need 
His goods and gifts, that we eat, drink and be merry. 
He is a rich God, will not and cannot hear that we 
should complain that he has nothing to give us, or that 
he cannot feed or provide for our poor sack of 
maggots. Yes, for this very reason he created the 
heavens and the earth and arranged them so that the 
air would give all kinds of birds, the sea and the water 
would bring all kinds of fish, and the earth would bear 
all kinds of countless fruits so that we could enjoy 
them. But he wants us to consider him our gracious 
God, that is, to fear, love and trust him, and to 
recognize that these are his goods and gifts, which 
we do not acquire through our care, diligence, toil and 
work, as the world thinks, but which come to us 
through his grace and blessing, for which we should 
give him heartfelt thanks and not forget our neighbor.

Erl. 52, 387-383. 


From the second epistle to Timotheum. 
Cap. 3, 16. 17. (1541) ) 


All Scripture, inspired by God, is useful for 
teaching, for punishment, for correction, for 
chastening in righteousness, that a man of God may 
be perfect, fit for all good works. 


That is, one should and must always read the Holy 
Scriptures, because they are necessary and useful 
for this purpose, since otherwise no other Scripture is 
useful 2) nor can help. 


Namely and first of all to teach. 


For that which it teaches is found nowhere else 
but of God the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, of 
Christ, of baptism, of the sacrament, of eternal life 2c. 
Also, young people grow up without ceasing, and 
strangers come to us, and we must always teach 
them these things. Although we are always allowed 
to do it for ourselves. For it can never be learned or 
lost, because it is a profound and groundless wisdom 
of God, which even the angels in heaven cannot be 
satisfied with and wonder at for eternity, as St. Peter, 
1 Ep. 1, 12, says. 


To punish the other. 

For the Scriptures alone help to resist all error, 
heresy and false doctrine, and to prevent the doctrine 
from being defiled. Just as a good shepherd not only 
feeds the sheep, but also fends off the wolves. For 
what good is it to teach well, and yet not to ward off 
the devil and the wolves? Thus says St. Paul, Titus 
1:9: "Let a bishop be able to teach, and also to punish 
the adversaries." What should other human doctrines 
defend, who do not know what the Holy Scripture 
teaches? Philosophers, physicians, lawyers and poets 
are of no use in this respect, since they are 
concerned with temporal life and know nothing about 
eternal life. 


Thirdly, to improve. 
Because we are still living in the flesh and in the 
devil's kingdom, in the world, the temptation is so

Small exegetical writings. 





W. IX, 1452-1455. 1851 

Much that even among the saints and Christians who 
receive the doctrine and are protected from heresy, 
various infirmities and cases occur, both in matters of 
faith and other things, and both stumble and fall, one 
in this and the other in that. For this reason, the 
Scriptures are needed once again to instruct the 
erring consciences, to settle the infirmities, and to 
restore the fallen; And so it is always necessary to do 
with the indolent, to comfort the afflicted, and all kinds 
of care and duty, as a good shepherd over that which 
he feeds and tends well, must also take special care 
of the sick, infirm sheep, heal and wait, so that they 
may be healed again, and not perish in themselves, 
whether there is already pasture enough and no wolf. 


Fourth, to chasten in righteousness. 

That is, all these things serve to discipline, 
educate and prepare the person who is to please and 
serve God, just as a child is raised to become pious 
and do much good, so that a Christian may also be 
useful in the church and before God. For to this end 
one also feeds, tends and cares for the sheep, so that 
they may give much milk, wool and lambs to the 
father of the house. But here it is said to be useful 
and fruitful in righteousness, that is, in such good 
works as do not make one rich and glorious in the 
sight of the world, as the other doctrines do, but 
which serve and belong to eternal life. For these are 
to be good works of him who is called God's man. 
Therefore, be careful to read the Scriptures, do not 
become weary, nor let yourself think that you are full 
and know everything well; otherwise you will 
understand nothing of them, when you think you 
have understood everything. 


All Scripture, inspired by God, is useful for 
teaching, for punishment, for correction, for 
chastening in righteousness, that a man of God may 
be perfect, fit for all good works. 3) 


One must always have such a ministry among the 
people of God, teaching those who are ignorant and 
punishing those who are repugnant, as those who 
are ignorant.

Martinus Luther, D. 


All Scripture, from GOtt 2c. 


The doctrine of men also has much to teach, to 
punish, to correct, to chastise, and makes hell more 
sour for the devil-martyrs than heaven is for the right 
saints. For everything goes the wrong way in 
unbelief, that is, in unrighteousness, so that they do 
no good work, much less can do right, are not skilled 
for it, because they do not respect God's word, or 
have not pure. 


All Scripture, inspired by God, is useful for 
teaching, for punishment, for correction, for 
chastening in righteousness, that a man of God may 
be perfect, fit for all good works. 2) 


Although there are many books that are very 
useful, and can make fine, skillful, learned people, it 
is all directed to this transitory life, and worldly 
wisdom or righteousness; cannot make a man of 
God, nor teach him, punish him, correct him, chastise 
him to righteousness, and make him skillful or perfect 
for all good works. Only the Holy Scriptures, inspired 
and taught by God Himself, must do this. Erunt omnes 
docibiles Dei [they will all be taught by God]. Joh. 6, 
45. 1545.

1853 


From the first epistle of St. Peter. 
Cap. 1, 25. 
The word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the 
word that is proclaimed among you. 

From this it follows that we will also remain and 
live with God in eternity, if we believe in the same 
word and remain with it. Therefore, such a word must 
certainly take away from us sin, death, hell and all 
misfortune, which oppresses, hurts and distresses us 
here temporally and there eternally. For this reason 
we should read the holy Scriptures (which are the 
Word of God) gladly and diligently, have pleasure and 
love for them, and seek comfort in them against all 
the wiles and temptations of the devil and the world. 


1 Petr. 5, 2. 


Feed the flock of Christ as you are commanded, and 
watch carefully, not forcibly but willingly. 

That is, not unwillingly nor displeased, or 
unenthusiastic, as those who alone look at the work 
ex Officio, not allowing themselves to be moved for 
the benefit of the souls. Non turpiter lucrosi, sed 
voluntarie, that is, willingly and heartily. Non 
dominanter, sed exemplariter, voluntarie. Even in 
poverty and lack, to remain cheerful, to teach for 
nothing, to praise God and to benefit souls. 

1 Petr. 5, 7. 


Cast all your care upon him, for he cares for you. 

If God (as St. Peter says here from the 55th 
Psalm, v. 23) cares for His faithful, how is it then that 
they are burdened and oppressed with so much 
misfortune, sorrow, fear and hardship in front of other 
people on earth, both by the devil and the world, who 
plague them with cunning and treachery, also with 
physical tyranny and persecution, without ceasing, 
seek their body, honor and goods, and would like to 
have them dead every hour? Who let themselves be 
seen and felt as if God were angry with them, had 
abandoned them and subjected them to the devil's 
power, but would not let him take care of them and 
provide for them in a fatherly way. 

Such, namely, that God will take care of us, 


1854 ex. 52, 391-394. Small exegetical wri 
and love us as his children, belongs to faith, which 
alone is the master who sees God's word and work 
rightly and teaches to understand thoroughly. Now the 
Word clearly testifies that God chastises those whom 
He loves and punishes every son whom He receives, 
as the Scriptures preach everywhere. Hence the 4th 
Psalm, v. 4, says that God leads His saints 
wonderfully. Faith adheres to such a word, acts 
according to it, lets God rule and take care, and says 
with Job: Etiamsi occiderit me, in eum sperabo, that is, if 
God were to strangle me, | would still hope in Him and 
rely on His grace. 


From the first epistle of John. 
Cap. 5, 14. 15. 

This is the joy we have in the Son of God, that if 
we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And 
if we know that he hears us, what we ask, we know 
that we have the request, so we have asked of him. 

The church of God on earth, which in this mortal 
life is laid under the cross and must daily bear great 
misery, has no greater consolation than that God 
promises it that He will certainly consider those who 
believe and trust in Christ, His Son, and confess such 
faith, to be His church, and that He will be with them 
in their distresses and miseries, work in them, and 
miraculously save and preserve them, even though 
they have no visible protection and help. 

And that they may learn and experience this, how 

God governs them wonderfully, he directs them from 
looking and waiting for all visible consolation to the 
invocation they are to practice in faith in the name of 
Christ, and thus assures them and not otherwise that 
they shall have certain help and salvation, if they 
believe that God has accepted them as His dear 
children, and hears their invocation for the sake of the 
Mediator, His dear Son 2c. 
Therefore, St. John says here that this is our joy (that 
is, our highest, certain comfort), which we have in the 
Son of God, so that in our highest distresses, 
afflictions and miseries we can and may rejoice in the 
Son of God. 





1855 


ings. W. IX, 1457-1460. 


If we ask anything according to his will (that is, that 
which is necessary for the honor of his name and 
word, the preservation of his kingdom and church, 
and for our salvation, as he has commanded us and 
taught us to pray), we can rely completely on it, that 
such a request will certainly be heard and the request 
granted. 

We must hold on to this by faith, and persevere in 
it, even if we do not see or know how and when we 
are to be helped. 

And notice how St. John here overturns and 
condemns the papists' doctrine of doubt (which they 
now affirm and defend in their Concilio) in clear words, 
since he says: "We know that he hears us what we 
ask." Item, "we know that we have the request" 2c. 
Knowledge, however, is not to doubt grace and 
hearing, but to conclude firmly and certainly against 
all doubt (even if all creatures say otherwise) that God 
hears us for Christ's sake 2c. Do not let this be taken 
away from you, even if an angel from heaven (the 
Concilium will remain silent) teaches you otherwise 2c. 
So he also shortly before condemned such doubt with 
clear and hard words, since he speaks, who does not 
believe God, makes God a liar. 


Faithful and earnest warning to devout, God-fearing 
hearts. 


If | were to live another hundred years, and had 
not only laid down the previous and present storms 
and tempests by God's grace, but could also lay 
down all future ones in this way, | can see that this 
would not give our descendants peace, because the 
devil lives and reigns. Therefore | also ask for a 
merciful hour, and desire no more of the being. You, 
our descendants, also pray with earnestness, and 
diligently drive God's word; preserve the poor lantern 
of God; be warned and prepared, as those who have 
to wait for all hours, where the devil may throw out a 
pane or window, tear open a door or roof, to 
extinguish the light. 

Therefore be sober, and watch; he sleepeth not, 
neither feeleth, neither dieth till the latter day. | and 
you must die, and if we are dead, yet he remains the 
same as he always was, and his storming can be

do not let. Christ, our dear Lord, who has crushed his 
head, come and deliver us at last from his storm, 
amen. 


A beautiful, comforting saying of 
certainty of our bliss. 


God could not have made the promise of the 
Gospel and salvation higher, firmer and more certain 
for us than with the suffering and death of His only 
begotten Son. If we now believe with all our hearts 
that he, the Son of God, died for us, overcoming sin 
and death, and take comfort in the promise of the 
Father, we have the letter in full, and the seals, the 
holy sacraments, baptism and the body and blood of 
Christ, hanging on it, and are well assured and 
provided for. Heaven is given and bestowed upon us 
freely, for we have done nothing nor can do anything 
to obtain it; Christ our Lord has purchased it for us 
with His precious blood. We have letters, the eternal, 
unchangeable promise of the gospel, and seals, that 
is, we have been baptized and, according to Christ's 
command, we receive his body and blood in the 
Lord's Supper when we feel our weakness and need. 

May God now have mercy and help us to take 
good care of the letters, so that the devil does not 
tear them from us, that is, so that we are not safe in 
prosperity, not sad and despondent in tribulations, 
but always live in the fear of God, remain firm and 
constant in the faith and confession of Jesus Christ, 
and always speak the holy Lord's Prayer with mouth 
and heart, and ask that God, for the sake of His dear 
Son, may preserve us and our descendants in the 
blessed teaching of the Gospel, Amen. 


Faithful exhortation to true repentance and 
Christian prayer by D. M. Luther, so he did in the 
presence of Prince Georgen zu Anhalt 2c. 
and other scholars. 


The papists are mad and nonsensical against us, 
want to defend their doctrine with long spears and 
violence, because they cannot raise anything against 
us with the pen and truth. | have asked God with 
great earnestness, and still ask daily, that He may 
guide their counsel, 


and let no war come in Germany during my life; and 
| am sure that God truly hears such my prayer, and 
knows that, because | live, no war will come in 
Germany. When | die now, rest and sleep, too, pray. 

But no one can call Jesus, the Son of Mary, Lord, 
that is, trust him as God with all his heart and call 
upon him, because he has the Holy Spirit. But this is 
not given to the despisers of the divine word, 
blasphemers, epicurians, disobedient, murderers, 
envious, gluttons, drunkards, fornicators, adulterers, 
fornicators, thieves, miserly, usurers, those who 
measure unjustly; item, those who mislead their 
neighbor, translate 2c., those who bear false witness, 
unjust and secure people. For such, and all those 
who safely go on as if there were no other life after 
this short, miserable life, are and remain eternally 
under the devil's power. 

Therefore, each one should diligently hear God's 
word and accept it with true faith, recognize his sin, 
be terrified by God's great wrath, and renounce his 
sinful life and improve himself, earnestly seeking 
forgiveness for all his sins, and firmly believing that 
they are forgiven for the sake of Christ, who sacrificed 
Himself for them. At the moment he sincerely 
believes that they are forgiven for Christ's sake, and 
receives the first fruits of the Spirit, he confidently 
asks, on God's promise, for relief from the temporal 
punishment that surely follows disregard for the 
divine word and other sins, in which the world now 
swims and is drowned, but after heartfelt repentance, 
conversion, prayer, obedience, humility toward God, 
and after fervent love and all the good works that God 
gives toward the neighbor, will be relieved by grace. 
As Daniel Cap. 4, 24. itis written: "Rid yourself of your 
sins by righteousness, and rid yourself of your iniquity 
by doing good to the poor, and God will have patience 
with your sins." And Zach. 1, 3: "Turn unto me, and | 
will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts." 

For it is a gross, even harmful error to want to find 
fault without all fear of God, not to mend one's ways, 
and yet not to await punishment from God. No, it does 


1858 


Erl. 52, 396-398. 


But this is what they say: If you sin, lie down willingly 
and say, "Dear father, strike and strike with 
confidence; | have, alas, done it well. But let it be a 
father's rut; as thou then stumpest all thy children 
whom thou lovest. For those whom you do not punish 
because of their sin are not children, but bastards, 
Hebr. 12, 8. Therefore, strike, whip, and thrash us 
quickly, just judge, but also merciful father, so that 
you do not turn your divine fatherly heart away from 
us, so that we may praise and glorify you here and 
there forever, amen. 

We are also to love one another warmly, and so, 
as God loved us, who gave his only begotten Son to 
die for us, as Christ says John 15:9, 13: "As my 
Father loves me, so | love you." "Greater love hath no 
man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." 
So we should also love one another, and, as Isaiah 
chap. 62:4 says, so love one another, as one dear 
brother loves another, since one sorrow is the sorrow 
of both, one joy the joy of both; yea, they would divide 
the heart in the body with one another, and die one 
for another a hundredfold. If such are murdered, shall 
we not be heartily sorry and grieve? But a thousand 
times greater is the sorrow of the heart when 
unbelievers die. 

Therefore, each one should ask with such 
earnestness, as if he alone wanted to ask, that the 
dear God would let it come from the sword to the 
Father's repentance, and relieve the punishment. He 
will certainly do so, for the sake of His holy name, 
which we preach, confess and call upon, even though 
we are poor sinners, yet we hold His word dear and 
valuable, and do not blaspheme and persecute like 
our adversaries, whose attacks will finally come upon 
themselves, as the prophet says in Ps. 7:16: "They 
have fallen into the pit they made.

It is certainly a pious man who takes care of a 
woman; 

It is certainly a pious woman, if she stays with 
a man. A husband should be patient, not keep 
his wife like a pig. A housewife should be 
sensible, learn her husband's ways well. 

God will have mercy on him, so that he will be 
gentle; and your devil will resist, so that he will 
not end his cunning. 


St. Augustine. 


Sin is not forgiven, unless what is taken 
is restored. 


Where human goods are stolen, the world has no 
doubt that they should and must be restituted, as all 
laws instruct and teach. This is the duty of the 
authorities and lawyers to judge and execute. Here 
no man is so low (who is not mad and foolish) that 
he thinks it is fair and right that each man's stolen 
property should be restored. For this reason, the 
world is full of trouble and misery, as can be seen 
every day. 

But whether one should or must return to God his 
stolen goods, no one cares. Even though he seeks, 
demands, urges, wraths, and also punishes and 
afflicts him so that he may get back what is his, the 
world asks nothing about it.

*Luther added these notes in Latin to a German New Testament, which was printed in octavo by Johann Lufft in Wittenberg in 1530. 
His son, Doctor Medicina Paul Luther, kept this copy in memory of his father, and allowed that in 1578 in Dresden a copy of the inscriptions in 
this book was taken, to which he added a certificate with his hand that the notes were written by his father himself, and that the copy is a faithful 
one (dona 660). The information that is found in Walch about the "manuscript" and the "original" does not give us sufficient information. Where 
the original had come to, says Walch < Introduction to the 9th volume, p. 34 d), "cannot be known", but the manuscript (ibi6. p. 35) "is available". 
Where? Walch does not indicate; on the other hand, he says vol. XIX, Einl. p. 109, that the German New Testament (i.e., the original?) is in the 
library of the Kirche zu unserer lieben Frauen in Halle. Luddorm, who in his 8uppl6M6ntuiu Dpistolnrurn Hsart. Imttiori (1703) p. 323 the first 
two larger pieces mitgetheilt, states: L Likliottteen Dorupli L. VirMnis Unlermi, also does not indicate by these words whether he has drawn from 
the original or from your manuscript. The translation of the annotations for Walch's edition was made by Friedrich Eberhard Rambach, who was 
deacon at this church. The words before the second paragraph: "Am Ende des B u chs" seem to indicate that he had the printed copy before 
him. The manuscript has the following title: reverenai pntris, domini aoctoris

up to the first epistle to the Corinthians, was published in the Fortgesetzten Sammlung von alten und neuen theologischen Sachen, 1730, p.

title: "Des hocherleuchtetten Mann GOttes D. Martini Lutheri Licht in Licht, oder kurze Anmerkungen und Erklarungen, die er zu seinen: Neue

Luddorm, the first two paragraphs are printed in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 432, and in the Erlangen edition, opp. var. ur’., vol. VII, p. 555 (under the 
prefaces); both have overlooked the fact that this piece is even found twice in Walch; once in the old edition, vol. XIX, 1774 (St. Louiser Ausg., 
Vol. XIX, 1460), and here. We give here the beginning in a new translation according to De Wette; for the notes we have 


retained Rambach's translation. -

trust in them. Now lest we should put confidence in 
them, it is expedient to condemn them, and make 
them sins, as they must be, when they are separated, 
as if they were righteousnesses, 1) separated from 
faith. But since faith by its nature is prior to works, we 
rightly say that we are justified by faith alone. For our 
believing is not by works, since they are not yet there 
or done, but by the word, which promises grace, and 
testifies that believers are acceptable to God and 
blessed, and that their sins are forgiven. Then it is 
through this faith that we do works, and so faith 
becomes, as it were, corporeal (crassescit) through 
the work, and that it can almost be grasped with the 
hands, as the Godhead alone makes Christ and the 
Lord, but nevertheless, since it took on the flesh, it 
becomes corporeal and palpable, as it is said in 1 
John 1:1: "The Word our hands have touched,” and 
[John 1:14] "dwelt among us." But as soon as you 
make a separation here, there is already nowhere 
else GOD, and the flesh becomes twofold corrupt. 
For if we were justified by the works that follow from 
faith, we would no longer be justified by faith itself, 
nor for Christ's sake, but for our own sake, who do 
works after faith; that is, deny Christ. For Christ is not 
taken by works, but by the faith of the heart. 
Therefore it is necessary that we be justified by faith 
alone, without, before, and apart from all works, but 
that the works themselves be approved for the sake 
of faith, be considered righteous, and be pleasing to 
God. Therefore, just as it is wrong for the righteous 
to be provided for the sake of future works, so it is 
wrong for them to be justified for the sake of future 
works of faith. But just as the grace of provision works 
works alone, electing without works 2) and calling 
without works. 


1) We have filled the gap at De Wette and in the Erlangen edition 
by essent. 
2) We have deleted the comma after sine operibus and placed a 
comma before these words. We have also had to make several 
changes in the punctuation of the editions.

who is to be justified and to do works: so also faith 
itself works works, justifying without works, and 
taking away sins before works. For faith is not for 
works, but works are for faith; neither does faith wait 
for works in order to be justified by them, but works 
wait for faith in order to be justified by it, so that faith 
is the active righteousness of works, and works the 
suffering righteousness of faith. Otherwise works 
would be the cause of righteousness, since without 
the same [cause] the effect of righteousness could 
not exist, even if faith were there (stante fide); just as 
the cause without the effect of righteousness 3) 
would be no cause at all 2c. 


[At the end of the book.] 4) 


To all the sayings of Scripture by which the 
righteousness of works seems to be established, we 
are to answer from Heb. 11 with this word: "By faith." 
.]. B. [Luc. 11, 41.], "Give alms, and all things shall 
be clean unto you," there answer, Prayer by faith. For 
so he puts there before all the works of the saints, 
"By faith," and gives the reason [Heb. 11, 6.], "For 
without faith it is impossible to please GOD." Now if 
you have faith in any works, you have at the same 
time righteousness without these works, because 
faith must necessarily precede works. But faith 
justifies, yes, itis righteousness, and so the one who 
is justified by faith also does works of faith. 

So much for Luther's own handwriting. 


[Under the register of the books of the New Testament are the 
following words:] 


Note that none of these books is ascribed to the 
Jews but to the Gentiles, except the Epistle to the 
Hebrews and the Epistle of Jacob, so that it may be 
seen that, as the prophets were sent to the Jews, so 
the apostles were sent to the Gentiles. 


3) Instead of justitia, jugtitiue will have to be read, as Rambach 
also translated. 
4) So Rambach instead: Lx kollern autoArupio.

Matth. 3, 8. 1) See to it that you do righteous fruits 
of repentance. The preaching of repentance is an 
abolition of the law. For it is preached to those who 
are under the law. Therefore, something more than 
the law is required. 

Matth. 4, 17. From that time on Jesus began to 
preach. He begins as a priest of the new law, soon 
after appoints his apostles, and with the abolition of 
the Levitical office he establishes a completely new 
teaching office, and does not choose any of the tribe 
of Levi for it. 

Matth. 5, 25. 2c. Be willing, that is, you should not 
think that this belongs to my kingdom, that one 
should avenge himself either by force or under the 
appearance of justice; rather, | hereby forbid it: Do 
not arrogate to yourself or abuse any power or 
judicial authority over your neighbor. Another is to 
use one's rights; another is to abuse them; another is 
to believe. In this last consists the kingdom of God. 

Matth. 10, 1. The calling of the ministers of the 
New Testament is connected with power and not with 
weakness like the Levitical priesthood. This chapter 
is, as it were, in the New Testament what the third 
book of Moses is in the Old Testament, because in it 
the apostles are ordained to the teaching office with 
its customs. 

Matth. 16, 19. And | will give you the keys of the 
kingdom of heaven. These are keys to bind and 
loose, but only to heaven, for they are called "the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven," not the keys of this 
world, with which to unlock closets, to give out food, 
drink, and the like, but they are keys that sins may be 
either loosed or bound. 

Matth. 18, 18. what you bind on earth. These are 
the keys that teach how to deal with sins. 


1) Because in the old editions of the Bible the verse numbers 
were not indicated, so it became necessary to designate the 
paragraphs and lines where the passages were to be found.] B. at 
this place the citation is given in such a way: "Matth. 3. § 3. 1 line 4. 
s", and likewise with allil following. We have, because the verse 
number is set by us, not indicated the paragraphs W and lines U1.

V. 10. The whole crowd of the people was outside

And, v. 13, your prayer is heard, that is, your 
prayer for the people is pleasing to God. 

And in the hymn of Zachariah v. 77: And give 
knowledge of salvation 2c. that they may know how 
they must be saved, not by works. 

V. 79. Those who sit in darkness and 2c. The poor

V. 4. and go after the lost one. It does not find

V. 8: And search diligently until she finds him. He 
does not find himself. 

V. 17: Then he smote upon himself. Notice how 
he first of all trusts in the Father, goes to him and 
makes his confession, so that you may learn from it 
that faith without works makes you righteous. This is 
a beautiful example of repentance and faith, because 
he recognizes sin and trusts in the grace of the 
Father. 

V. 25. But the eldest son. This son makes a

preached the law and confessed sins. 

Joh. 1, 9. which enlightens all people. There is an 
emphasis in the word "all"; everyone else wants to be 
a master, and yet he should have them all as 
disciples. 

V. 17: Grace and truth have come through Jesus 
Christ. Why then does one boast that many other new 
truths have been revealed to one about and apart 
from Christ? 

V. 26. | baptize with water 2c. By this is 
understood: He will baptize you with the Spirit. There 
is an ellipsis here, or lack of something in the speech. 

V. 41. We have found the Messiah. This is the first 
witness of Jesus. 

V.45. Philip finds Nathanael. The other witness of 
JEsu. From this the low and lowly beginning of the 
Lord JEsu can be seen. 

V. 47. In whom is no deceit, or in whom is no 
falsehood. 

V. 48. Nathanael answered. The third witness. 

Joh. 2, 12. and did not stay there long, because 
he went out to preach the gospel. 

V. 24. But Jesus did not confide in them. He had 
no. Trust in them, not even in those who begin to 
believe, to come, to go away again, and finally even 
to die. This is a hard speech. 

Joh. 3, 9. How can this happen? Reason wants to 
understand, but not to believe. But we cannot 
convince unbelievers, and the good cause of faith is 
not to be demonstrated. Christ here calls Nicodemum 
to faith, and did not answer him to the question, "How 
may this be?" 

V. 19. But this is the judgment. That is a great 
judgment, if one does not want to have forgiveness of 
sins. 

They are punished by the light, so they monkey 
with the light because they love their works. 

Having sin does no harm. But not wanting to have 
sin, that hurts a lot. For if you recognize them, they 
are forgiven. Only the opposite is harmful.

V. 35. He was a burning and shining light. The first 
witness is John. 

V. 36. For the works that the Father has given me. 
The other witness, the Father. 

V. 38. For you do not believe him who believes 
him. Apart from Christ, one knows nothing. He who 
does not believe in Christ remains in ignorance. 

V. 39. Search the Scriptures. The third witness, 
the Scriptures. 

V. 45. It is one 2c. The fourth witness, Moses. 

Joh. 6, 37. All that my Father gives me. Not the 
law, not human wisdom or power, or what is not God 
can give these things, for God chooses the foolish 
before the world. But those do not want to be such. 

Ibid. My father. There is an emphasis in the word: 
1) "My Father", which have a contrast and not an envy 
at the bottom, as if he did not want to give them all. 

V. 41. There murreten 2c. The word of faith is an 
annoyance. 

V. 45. They are all taught by God. None is taught 
by himself, as you pretend. 

V. 48. | am the bread of life. All this cannot be 
understood of the sacrament, not even by promise. 
For the sacrament does not give life to him who eats 
it. 

Joh. 11, 26. whoever lives and believes in me 2c. 
Do you believe that? 

Joh. 14, 1. Do not let your heart be troubled. If the 
world wants to deny you an inn and a dwelling place, 
know that instead of one you will have many others. 
For you will be repaid a hundredfold.

Joh. 15, 19. | have chosen you from the world. The

Joh. 16, 26. And! do not say to you that | have the 
Father 2c. So our works are like Christ's works; what 
shall we dispute further? 

V. 33. But be of good cheer 2c. Farewell, to good 
night. 

Joh. 17, 22. that they are one. So the works of 
Christ and the works of the righteous are of the same 
kind and nature. 

Joh. 18, 14. That a man might be put to death for 
the people. And Annas sent him to Caiphas the high 
priest. B. 

V. 24. And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the 
high priest. 

We want to set that this last sentence belongs 
before the first, then all dispute will have an end, but 
the historical order will have its correctness. This may 
be a mistake of the scribe who turned over another 
page, as often happens to scribes, especially to those 
who are quite diligent, and miss first in what they think 
about most. As this also tends to happen on other 
occasions. 

Joh. 20, 22. 23. Receive the Holy Spirit. Here you 
see that the keys are not given for the ordinance of 
new laws, but for the forgiveness or retention of sins. 
Everything that takes place in the punishment of sins 
in the church is not the order of men, but an execution 
of the office given with these keys, which has Christ, 
and not the popes, as its author. 


Right at the title of Acts. 

The Acts of the Apostles are such a book, in which 
it is proven that righteousness comes from faith alone, 
and not from works. This proof is found in the example 
of the Gentiles who have become believers, who are 
converted by the word of God, without any intention of 
their works. Whether such a thing can be borne by the 
Jews when it is difficult for them to accept this one 
thing, or whether it can be borne by the Jews when it 
is difficult for them to accept this one thing. 


If we do not make up for the fact that we were born 
and raised under the law, it is intolerable for us, who 
are Gentiles, to argue about works today, when we 
have a cloud full of witnesses and experience 
convincing us that grace and justification came to our 
ancestors without works. 

Apost. 2, 37. It went through their hearts. Behold, 
all these are converted and justified by the word of 
faith, without works of their own. 

V. 41. Who then gladly accepted his word even 
without previous works. 

Apost. 3, 25 Through your seed. Notice how the 
Scriptures are so specifically cited here. 

Apost. 4, 24. Lord, you are the God. This is the 
first prayer of the Church. 

V. 27. Herod and Pontius 2c. This is how it still 
goes today, and will probably remain so in the future. 

Apost. 7, 2. Since he was still in Mesopotamia, in 
Chaldea. Gen. 12. it is told a little different. 

V. 4. Since his father had died. Not so. Abraham 
was an idolater in Mesopotamia before he was called 
out of it, as can be seen in Jos. 24, 2. This story 
seems very incorrect if one does not consider all the 
circumstances. For Tharah begat Abraham when he 
was 70 years old, Gen. 11 [v. 26]. Abraham went out 
of Haran when he was 75 years old, Gen. 12:4. 
Tharah lived in all 205' years. So he went out of 
Haran 60 years before the death of Tarah. 

Apost. 8, 10. This is the power of God, or: This 
can mean a great power of God; or: This means a 
great power of God, this is the great power of God. 

V. 20: Obtained by money. In the papacy today, 
everything is sold for money in the same way. 

Apost. 9, 4. Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me. 
Paul is called without any works. 

V. 6. Get up and go to the 


1) 203 years after Gen. Il, 32. Walch: "269 years". Also the 
calculation shows that 205 is to be read.

City. Paul, after‘being already enlightened and 
called, is still sent to a man, that he may have men for 
witnesses. 

V. 12. and lay hands on him, not to call, but to 
heal. 

V. 27 Barnabas took him to himself. He must have 
a good testimony for the sake of the brothers. 

V. 35. They were converted to the Lord by word, 
without work or law. 

V. 36. A disciple. This one first becomes a disciple 
through faith, then she also works good. 

V.42. And many believed in the Lord through the 
word, without law or works of law. 

Apost. 10, 2. Godly and God-fearing; in faith in the 
future Christ, and yet without laws. 

V. 6. He will tell you what 2c. Also’ this one is 
called to faith before works. For because he says, 
"What thou shalt do," this implies that he has not 
merited grace by his previous works, but that 
according to the word of Peter all things shall be given 
to him. For Cornelius does not ask and seek this 
grace by words and works, he does not even know 
anything about it, but wants to learn to recognize it 
first from Peter's words. It is so far away that he 
should have earned it. Moreover, Cornelius was a 
Gentile, without law and circumcision. 

V.28. Not to call any man common or unclean, not 
to call any man either under the law or without the 
law, because grace and not merit is preached here. 

V. 30: | fasted four days. One can see here the 
weakness of the first church, how hard it holds on to 
the righteousness of faith, and how deeply ingrained 
the righteousness of works is. What would we do? 

V.34. Now | learn 2c. For this is a Gentile who has 
not lived under the law of Moses. So he is righteous 
without works. 

V. 43. Testify of this. The justified in faith by the 
name of Jesus. 

V. 44. As Peter 2c. Behold, all are justified without 
works, by the hearing of the divine word alone.

V. 47. That these be not baptized, these, namely, 
without law. 

V. 47. Just as we also, namely we who were under 
the law, those without works, but we with works. 

Apost. 11, 1. that also the Gentiles have God's 
word 2c. That seems to them to be a great strange 
thing. The works are in their eyes. That the Gentiles 
without the law and the works of the law should 
nevertheless be made equal to the Jews in the law 
and the works of the law, and again vice versa: o this 
is sour grapes. 

V. 17. So then God has given them equal gifts. 
Equal gifts in the works, without the works. 

V. 18: God has also given repentance to the 
Gentiles. It seems wonderful to them that salvation is 
granted even without the works of the law. 

V. 19. and spoke the word to no one but 
themselves, 2c. considering the Gentiles sinners, 
because they had no law and no works. The works 
will not yield. 

V.21. And a great number believed. Thus the 
Gentiles are converted without works of the law. 

V.23. And saw the grace of God in the Gentiles, 
without regard to the law and its works. 

V. 24: And there was a great nation of them. So 
the Gentiles are justified by the word, without the law. 

V. 28. Which happened under the emperor 
Claudio. So Lucas lived after Paul's death and also 
after the reign of Emperor Claudius when he wrote 
this. 

Apost. 12, 15. It is his angel. So they believe that 
the angels are servants of men. 

Apost. 13, 2. Send me out Barnab on 2c. Paul and 
Barnabas are sent out among the Gentiles. 

V. 12. He believed without works and without law. 

V. 27: Still the voice of the prophets. It is still the 
case today that many read and fulfill the words of the 
Gospel and the apostles, yet they know nothing about 
them. There you see that one can know a lot about

1878 





Christ and God, and yet deny and kill Him with it. 

V. 39. But he who believes in him is righteous. 
Christ is therefore true God, because he is believed 
in, because in him one has life and true 
righteousness, all of which belong to none other than 
the true God. 

V. 43. Paulo and Barnaba followed many Jews by 
the word, incited without law, and yet are converted. 

V. 45. And they contradicted it. This is what the 
Jews did at that time, but we do it much worse. For 
they did not know, but we know, that the grace of 
Jesus Christ came upon the Gentiles without law and 
works of law. 

V. 48. But since the Gentiles heard it. The Gentiles 
are converted here, therefore the works do not make 
them righteous before God. 

Apost. 14, 1. that a great multitude of the Jews 2c. 
By the word, without works. 

V. 9 He heard Paul speak. He hears and believes, 
even though he has no works to show. 

V.21. And instructed them much by word. 

Apost. 15, 1. where you do not allow yourselves 
to be circumcised. They considered circumcision 
necessary for salvation. 

V. 5. They must be circumcised. This is a proof of 
the weakness of the first Christian church. 

V. 9. and made no distinction. Thus, there is no 
distinction between Jews and Gentiles, and even 
circumcision has no preference. 

V. 11. But we believe through the grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ 2c. Christ is true God, because His 
grace alone can save. 

V. 12. Like great signs and wonders 2c. That is, 
among those who were not circumcised, which they 
insisted on. 

V. 19. Do not make trouble by putting the law on 
their necks. 

V. 21. And became all Sabbath days in the 2c. 
There let him also remain. 

V. 28. For it pleases the Holy One 





Spirit and us. Thus, freedom from the law is 
established. 

W 28: These necessary pieces. Above it was said 
that the law must not be fulfilled. From this it follows 
that the law of love is spoken of here. 

V.31. They were comforted because they were 
free from the law. 

V.32. And they strengthened them against the 
lawmakers. 

V. 39. And they came sharply at one another. This 
is a dispute among the apostles, who were otherwise 
the most intimate friends. 

Apost. 16, 1. There was a disciple there named 
Timothy. This one becomes a disciple before he can 
show good works. 

V. 4. To keep the saying, 
concerned freedom from the law. 

V. 14: To whom the Lord opened the heart. 
Behold, here God opens the heart and teaches that 
man is converted by the word, without works. 

V. 17. These people are servants of God. There 
we hear how the devil also preaches, but only that he 
does harm, and presents the apostles as people who 
are like him. But with this he is a liar and a deceiver. 

V. 29. But he asked for a light. | believe that this 
one will be converted even without works. 

Apost. 17:4 And some of them fell to him by the 
word without works. 

V. 11. They received the word even without works. 

V. 34. But some men clung to him by the word 
without works. 

Apost. 18, 8. Crispus, the head of the school. They 
are converted by the word, without merit of works. 

V. 14. sacrilege or mischievousness, cunning or 
violence. 

V. 18. And he shaved his head. Paul becomes a 
Nazarite here. 

V. 21. | have to all things. Here he is Jewish- 
minded. 

V.22. And went up to Jerusalem to the feast. 

V. 27 The brothers wrote. A written testimony must 
be had for the sake of the false brethren. 

Apost. 19, 3. on the baptism of St. John. 


namely, which

They are also converted by John's words, without 
law. 

V. 5: They were baptized. So Apollo was also 
baptized anew, although it is not expressly reported 
here. 

V. 10. Hear the word of the Lord JEsu; by the 
word, without law. 

Apost. 20, 21. and have testified of repentance 
and faith. 

V.30. To draw the disciples to themselves from 
Christ and from believing in the works they had 
devised? 

Apost. 21, 4. They told Paul through the spirit. But 
Paul did not obey the spirit. 

V.9. And prophesied, the daughters of Philippi. 1) 

V.11. This is what the Holy Spirit says. Paul again 
did not obey the same Spirit. 

V. 13. What are you doing? 2c. Paul resists the 
Spirit for the third time. 

V. 19. Among the Gentiles by His ministry, without 
law and law works. 

V.20. They praised the Lord and affirmed the 
same. 

V. 20: Those who have believed find. These have 
become believers, and yet they are zealous for the 
law. This is something wonderful. 

V. 22. What is it then? 2c. He has been accused 
as having rejected the law as something evil. 

V. 24. And incur the expense to them. That is, for 
the sake of others, only do not pay attention to the 
costs that would otherwise not be necessary except 
in this case. 

V. 25: That they keep none; they shall keep none. 
Mark it well. 

V. 26. and let himself be seen, so that he would 
not have the appearance of having rejected the law 
as something evil. 

V. 37. Do you know Greek? Behold, are you so 
learned that you know Greek? 


1) It seems to us that the copyist here (as well as afterwards 
Apost. 27, 21.) did not refer the note to the correct text and therefore 
did not understand it. The old edition offers: "V. 8. 'And went into the 
house of Philippi* The daughters of Philippi." tilius is taken as genitive 
singularis, while it is nominative pluralis.- This note is meant to 
indicate that not "we who were about Paulo" is the subject of the 
sentence, but "the daughters- 


Apost. 22, 14. That you should know his will. To 
know the will of God. 

V. 14. And see the righteous one, the righteous 
one who makes all others righteous. 

V.22. But they listened to him except for this word, 
2) which they did not like. 

Apost. 23, 8. For the Sadducees say. These are 
the right comrades, the Sadducees. 

V. 10. But the Pharisees confess both the spirits 
and the resurrection of the bodies. 

V. 14. We have banished ourselves harshly. O! 
you holy. Murderers, pray for us. 

Apost. 26, 16. ff. Christ is true God, because we 
should believe in none other than the true God. 

Apost. 27, 21. And since one had not eaten for a 
long time. Not just in two weeks. 3) Not because of 
the fasting, but because of the storm. 

V.33. They were left without food and had not 
eaten for a long time, because they had had a storm 
for fourteen days in a row and had not eaten for a 
long time. 

Apost. 28, 3. But Paul had a heap of branches. 
The apostle himself gathers branches for burning. 

V. 15. He thanked God and gained a confidence. 
Paul has no qualms about taking comfort from his 
brothers. 

V. 17. Still against fatherly manners. Yes, yes, 
you, yes! 

V. 19, As if | had something to accuse my people 
of. We do not have to accuse, but we do have to 
defend. 

V. 22: For of this sect we are informed. This is the 
glory of the gospel. 

V. 28: That the salvation of God is sent to the 
Gentiles. But now these same Gentiles are cruelly 
persecuting the salvation of God, because the 
kingdom of the Antichrist has corrupted and 
perverted everything, as was said before. 


2) "Except for this word" we have added. 
3) The following words find in the old edition as belonging to the 
words v. 27: "And when we went into Adria". This seems to us not to 
be correct, therefore we have drawn them to v. 21.

Rom. 1, 17. which comes from faith in faith. "By 
faith," from the weak faith begun away into the 
strong. Because faith does not celebrate. 


Luther noted the following in passing: 


It is one kind of justification of faith through the 
promised and expected, as now through the sent 
Christ. But the faith itself is not the same. For when 
the faith of the sent Christ came, the faith of the 
promised Christ ceased, just as the same Christ is 
expected in faith as the future judge, and will be the 
same when | see him face to face. And yet then faith 
will cease, but Christ will remain as he is. So he 
teaches that although the faith of the fathers in the 
Old Testament and those in the New Testament 
were not of the same nature, they were justified by 
the same Christ. Thus it is said in Rom. 13:11: "Our 
salvation is nearer than we believed." It is the same 
God who justifies the circumcision and the Gentiles 
through faith, because the Gentiles did not know 
anything about faith before. 

V. 19: For it is known that God exists. That there 
is a God is proven by the continuous benefits of 
creation that we enjoy, and yet we do not recognize 
Him or thank Him. 

V. 21: Have not praised him. To praise God is first 
of all to recognize Him; when one has recognized 
Him, to praise Him and thank Him for His benefits; 
further, to trust Him, to fear Him and to love Him. And 
that is to worship God in spirit. 

Rom. 3, 2. They are trusted. Psalm 147:20 says: 
"He does not do this to a Gentile. For all the books of 
the Scriptures come from the Jews, and none from 
the Gentiles. 

V. 20. Therefore that no flesh by the work of the 
law 2c. We are justified by faith alone, because 
Christ alone is the one who bore our sins, and no 
other. And this cannot be obtained in any other way 
than by faith. 

V. 27: By the law of works. Notice that he does 
not say by the works of the law, but by the law of 
faith. 


V. 28: Without the work of the law. For works 
follow faith, and do nothing to justify, but come after. 
But faith and the word are present beforehand and do 
their part, that is, they justify. 

V. 30. By faith. "By faith," because faith and 
promise existed before and this is only fulfilled; "by 
faith," in regard to those who had no faith and 
promise, but everything became absolutely new. 

Rom. 4, 2. He has glory. A worker has wages and 
honor, but only in the world. 

V. 5: His faith is reckoned to him. To be counted 
means as much as to be accepted by grace. 

V. 6. after which way. Rule: The works of faith are 
seals of righteousness and of faith already present. 
V. 11: That he might become a father. Abraham is the 
supreme father of faith, for he 1) became righteous 
without works, and that 2) before the law; and lest 
anyone dream that the works of the law were 
blameless, 3) his works are regarded as the seal of 
the righteousness of faith. But he himself 4) is 
presented to all as a pattern of how they should be 
justified before God. 

V. 18. And he believed in hope. See the thoughts 
of faith in his heart. And in this he sets forth the right 
praise of faith, that we should know how Abraham did 
not earn his justification by works, but only believed, 
that is, honored God, did not think of his own good 
works, but only relied on God's promise that he would 
call to what was not there to be. These are the 
thoughts with which faith occupies and exercises 
itself before it does its own works. He takes hold of 
God's works ‘even before they are done. 

V. 21: That which God promises, He is able to do. 
Faith takes hold of the present word and the future 
deed of God promised in it. 

V. 24. But also for our sake. See then that this faith 
of Abraham is not a miracle, but only an example.

Rom. 5, 9. by his blood, not by our works. 

Rom. 6, 20: For if you were servants of sin. 
Outside of Christ there is only the servitude of sin, but 
in Christ you rule over it. 

Rom. 7, 1-3. By some special law he abolishes the 
whole law so that we are free and can no longer be 
sued by it. 

V.3. That she not be an adulteress. Lest she have 
a guilt of sin in her conscience for eternity. 

V. 4. So also 2c. The freedom from the law. 

Rom. 8, 1. ff. The law of faith is a law of the. Spirit 
and of life. The law of the letter is a law of sin and 
death. 

V. 2. Freedom from the accusing and killing 
law. 

Note: It is called a law of sin and not of 
righteousness, a law of death and not of life. 

V. 3. The law is fulfilled through Christ. 

V. 24. But in hope. In hope we are blessed. 

V. 34. Christ the mediator. 

Rom. 9, 5. Who is God over all. Christ true God. 

[V. 7 ff. and] v. 10. But also there Rebekah. Two 
examples that they [Isaac and Jacob] are children of 
promise. 

Isaac ) Filii promissionis, ) 


"

Jacob j habentes 

regni; hic regni jam vivens.... 

V. 12. But by the grace of the caller. Jacob was 
also a son of promise, like Isaac. 

V. 13: But | hated Esau. Just as it was shown in 
fact. 

V. 22: He bore them with great patience. Because 
they practice much evil against him, and yet he bears 
them. 

Rom. 10, 3. seek to establish their own 
righteousness. Hereby he rejects not only the works 
of the law, but also the righteousness that is sought 
apart from faith. 





V. 9 For if you confess with your mouth. This is a 
noun, noting that he actually and clearly attributes 
righteousness to the faith of the heart, and not to the 
confession of the mouth. 

V. 20: | am invented by them. So he shows his 
grace freely and in vain to those who do not seek 
him, but as it were do another work, that is, evil. 

Rom. 11, 1. ff. This is against the Jews. Whether 
the promise was fulfilled when almost the whole 
nation perished. 

V. 8. a fierce spirit. This is true, which is why the 
seventh Psalm calls him an avenger. 

V. 26. All Israel blessed. The Israel that was to be 
gathered from both Jews and Gentiles. 

V. 31. Believe in mercy. Believe therefore in 
mercy. 

Rom. 13, 3. Thus you will have praise from the 
same. The vengeance of civil justice and the praise 
of civil government extends only to this life. 

V. 11: Because we believed. Namely, in the faith 
of the fathers in the expected Savior, it is now given 
to us. He does not say that at that time there was no 
salvation at all, but that now it has only become 
closer. 

V. 14. Do not do according to the prudence of the 
flesh to atone for its lust. With the gloss: These are 
the false wicked wiles and wiles of the carnal and 
worldly hearts in all manner of things. Whereby he 
[Luther] distinguished the text and changed it to the 
following form: "And waiteth not for the lust of the 
body." 

Rom. 14, 10. Before the judgment seat of Christ. 
Consequently, Christ is the true God. 

V. 23: For it is not of faith. This saying actually 
teaches what faith is, namely to have confidence in 
God so that there is no more condemnation of sin. 

Rom. 15, 9. But that the Gentiles praise God for 
mercy. But nowadays we are more imprudent with 
the mercy of God than the Jews, so far is it from us 
that we should be thankful. We reintroduce the 
unbelieving and ungrateful synagogue. 

V. 27. that they also gave them in the flesh.

livelihood. 

Rom. 16, 19. that you may be wise for good, 
prudent for good, foolish for evil. 

1 Cor. 1, 10. and make division. No wonder there 
are sects nowadays. 

1 Cor. 12, 9: One another's faith. The apostle 
clearly testifies that he is speaking of the manifest gifts 
of the Holy Spirit in the church, and therefore not of 
justifying faith, but of that which expresses itself in the 
confession of the truth. Balaam, the heretics and all 
unbelievers have the same faith. For even the 
ungodly can have such gifts. Saul, Balaam and 
Caiaphas prophesy. 

1 Cor. 13, 2. so that | moved mountains. Balaam 
certainly performs a miracle by prophesying and 
blessing. So also Saul. Although in this place it is 
uncertain whether Paul is setting a possible or 
impossible condition. But there is nothing in it. Enough 
that such things are common to the wicked and the 
faithful. 

2 Cor. 9, 5. so that it is a blessing and not a 
stinginess. Stinginess, that is, meager and little giving, 
but it should be a blessing, that is, mild and abundant 
giving. 

2 Cor. 10, 15. 16. The spirits of the wicked can do 
nothing more than fall into other people's work and 
rebuke it, and then boast that they did it, and not the 
former right teachers and apostles who abandoned 
them. It is the bumblebees that eat the honey of the 
bees, which they have not made. Therefore Satan is 
called Beelzebub, that is, such a blasphemer. Hos 
ego versiculos feci [i.e. these little verses | have 
made]. 1) 

2 Cor. 12, 9. For my power is mighty in the weak. 
Must you also be taught this, and you have taught it 
to all the world until now? Where is here the teacher 
of the Gentiles in the truth? Have you now become a 
disciple? 

Gal. 1, 6. who called you into the grace [of Christ]. 
Behold, so he departs from grace who follows after 
works.

have taught rightly, but now we understand all the 
more what we have been taught. 

V. 12: For | received it from no man. It is 
impossible for the gospel to be invented by human 
reason. They spoke through the Holy Spirit. 2 Petr. 1, 
21. 

V. 16: That he might reveal his Son in me. To me, 
who was a persecutor and did not deserve it. 

V. 16: That | might preach it through the gospel. 
The Gentiles were not to have the law preached to 
them, but the gospel. 

Gal. 2, 6. but from them 2c. | have received 
nothing. 

V. 9. who were considered pillars. Most of them 
are with me. 

V. 15. Although we are Jews by nature 2c. We are 
Jews by nature, that is, we have something to live for 
in the law and its works, as those who were born and 
raised in it. But the Gentiles are sinners, that is, 
without law and law's works. 

Eph. 1, 3. who blessed us. Indein seed shall be 
blessed, Gen. 12, 3. 2) 

V. 6. In praise of His glorious grace. Not from the 
works. 

V. 7. by his blood. Not by our merit. 

V. 14: The pledge of our inheritance. This is the 
firm trust in his promise. 

Eph. 2, 10. For we are his workmanship. We are 
a very special creature that was made for this 
purpose. 

Eph. 3, 1. For you Gentiles. Not for your sins, but 
for your good and glory, as follows. 

V. 13. For the sake of my afflictions, which | 2c. 
Was Paul crucified for us? 1 Cor. 3, 4. 9. 22. 
Therefore he suffers for the glory of the Gentiles. 

Eph, 4, 28. who stole 2c. Who is not a thief these 
days, after all? 

Eph. 6, 13. In the evil day. On the day of 
temptation and satanic wrath: 

V. 14: Gird up your loins with truth. Gird up your 
loins with truth, that is, do not act deceitfully in your 
office. This is the right breastplate against the

The neighbor, to prove oneself righteous and innocent 
against him. To be booted to the gospel of peace 
means to preach the gospel in the power of the cross. 
The shield of faith is to confront Christ with the 
accuser, Satan. The helmet of salvation is to take 
comfort in the hope of the life to come while despising 
the present. 

V. 15. so that you may be prepared. 1 Thess. 5, 5. 
8. 

V. 18. In the spirit. Not with the mouth alone. 

Phil. 1, 10. Indecent, ampdc¢x6rroi. 

1 Thess. 5, 8. with the cancer. Of these weapons 
he deals a little differently Eph. 6, but he does not turn 
back on the fact that he uses the same words 
everywhere; here he speaks differently and there 
again differently. 

1 Tim. 1, 16. that in me especially 2c. Notice here 
that Paul, in his way of justification, is not called a 
miracle but an example. 

1 Tim. 6, 17. who gives us abundantly, all things 
2c. He gives it to us for our enjoyment, not that we 
should worship it or put our trust in it. 

2 Tim. 3, 16. For all Scripture is inspired by God, 
2c. To teach the ignorant, to refute those who are 
wrong, to punish those who are lacking, to make up 
for what is lacking, so that discipline and order may be 
maintained everywhere. 

1 Petr. 1, 1. to the chosen strangers, that is, to the 
Gentiles. 

V. 12. Which also the angels desire to behold. It is 
a joy to the angels to see the gospel revealed in the 
world, which they knew would one day be preached. 
And we despise and persecute the same. 

1 Petr. 2, 11. Dear brothers. So far the apostle has 
dealt with truths of faith, now he comes to 
exhortations. 

V. 14. For vengeance. Not for justice, but for praise 
and vengeance before GOD. This is the final purpose 
of civil justice. So you see that here promise and 
threat are combined. Therefore, civil faithfulness is 
necessary before works. 

V. 21. an example, exemplar. 





V. 24. Which our sin itself 2c. A gift. 

1 Petr. 3, 16. With meekness and with fear. Do not 
make proud thoughts of your own wisdom and 
understanding in the Scriptures. 

1 Petr. 4, 8. Love covers 2c. But hatred discovers 
a lot of virtues in yourself, so that you cannot bear 
even the most wholesome words from your brother. 
Hatred makes people black and ugly, as if they were 
devils, though they are more beautiful than angels. 

V. 11: That he should do it as from his own ability. 
In the gospel, there is no reliance on one's own 
strength. 

V. 13: That you suffer with Christ. An example. 

2Petr. 1, 1. to those who are with us. The Gentiles. 

V. 9. He is blind. So the one who is not obedient 
to the gospel understands nothing. 

V. 15: To keep this in mind. Yes, indeed. 

2 Petr. 2, 10. ') The single state. 

V. 13: The wages of unrighteousness. 1 Tim. 6, 5.: 
Those who think that godliness is a small matter. 

1 Joh. 1, 1. Christ true God is also a man. 

V. 2. And life has appeared. Christ is the eternal 
life, therefore he is also true God. 

V. 7. and the blood of Jesus Christ. Nothing but 
Christ's blood can cleanse from all sins. 

V. 10. Thus we make him a liar. No different than 
if he died in vain for our sin. 

1 Joh. 2, 1. Thus we have an advocate. What 
Christ is, is not taught in the papacy. 

V. 7. The old commandment. The word of faith is 
always old and new. 

V. 9. He is in darkness who continues to hate 
Christ. 

V. 19. They went out from us. The worst people 
always come out of the Christians, which is truly a

is a nuisance. Just as the devil came from the angels, 
and Judas from the apostles. 

V. 23. He who denies the Son. Apart from Christ 
there is no other God. 

V. 27. But like unto you the anointing 2c. He that 
abideth in Christ shall not be ashamed in the day of 
judgment. 

1 Joh. 3, 3. who purifies himself. Whoever calls on 
the name of the Lord resigns from unrighteousness. 

V. 6: He who abides in him. Against the impudent 
and impure papists. 

V. 8: He who commits sin. Against the same. 

V. 9: He who is born of God. This is completely at 
odds with each other, being born of God and yet 
being able to sin. 

V. 12. And why did he strangle him? Why do the 
wicked kill the saints? Because they do not like to be 
ungodly. 

V. 23. And this is his commandment. This is the 
greatest commandment of love for God and neighbor. 

1 Joh. 4, 1. do not believe 2c. but test everything. 

V. 1. Many false prophets. If false prophets were 
already then, what will be now? 

V. 3. Every spirit that confesseth not 2c. Those 
also deny that Christ came in the flesh, who deny the 
cause why he came, namely, to save us from our sins 
without merit of our works. 

V. 3. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist. The 
mystery of the Antichrist has already begun at that 
time. 

V. 6: He who knows God. The world laughs at this 
and says: Why do you not believe us? Why do you 
judge those who do not believe you? 

V. 9. that we should live through him. Behold, this 
is why the Son of God came into the flesh. 

V.10. That God sent His Son, for this Christ came. 

V.17. That we may have joy. He who walks in love 
awaits the day of future judgment with joy. But the 
wicked do not so. 





V. 18. He is not perfect in love. He is not perfect, 
but neither is he a reprobate. For the fear of 
punishment is necessary in repentance, because it 
comes from the knowledge of the law and from the 
wrath of God revealed therein against sin. 

1 Joh. 5, 1. He also loves the 2c. Apart from Christ 
there is no God. 

V. 16. It is a sin unto death. Here is a contrast 
between a sin that is unto death and one that is not. 

V. 20. This is the true God 2c. If he himself is 
eternal life, he must also be true God. 

V. 21. Beware of idols, even spiritual idols against 
Christ. 

2 John, v. 7. for many deceivers. Was that already 
at the time, what wants to become nowadays? 

V. 9: He who transgresses and does not abide in 
the doctrine of Christ. Apart from Christ there is no 
God. For "he that denieth the Son denieth the Father 
also". Thus concludes John, 1 Ep. 2, 23, and is also 
true. 

3 John, v. 10. And chattereth against us with evil 
words. This is what happened to such a great man in 
the first church: what will they not do to us in the heats 
of these last days? 

Hebr. 1, 10. And you, Lord, have the earth from 
the beginning. This proof is obscure, where no 
attention is paid to the fact that Christ is spoken of. 
For since he had ascribed eternity to the Son, he now 
proves that he cannot be a creature, because the 
latter is perishable. 

Hebr. 2, 13. | will put my trust in him. That is, he 
confesses that he has suffered, which is what the 
author actually wants to say. 

V. 14: The one who has the power of death. This 
is the prince of death. 

V. 17. Therefore he had to suffer all things. Here 
he comes back to his sentence that Christ had to 
suffer. 

Hebr. 3, 3. for the house. Christ is the builder of 
the house. 

V. 6. as ason over his house, which was created 
by him. 

V. 10. Always they err with the 


1886 


hearts. They pretend with words, and with outward, 
assumed appearances.  V. 12. A bad, unbelieving 
heart. It is in the heart. 

Hebr. 6, 1. Therefore we want the doctrine of the 
beginning 2c. This does not mean that he despises 
those teachings, but because they are not appropriate 
here, since he is willing to deal with the abolition of 
the old law and to prove this from the Scriptures. Here 
he is not to be regarded as a teacher and admonisher, 
but as a disputant and refuter. 

V. 13. for as God Abraham 2c. Here the argument 
and refutation begins, and in doing so he draws into 
consideration all the words of the verse. For the first 
he deals with it: "He has sworn." 

Hebr. 7, 1. this 2c. The wise Melchizedek. 

V. 7: That the inferior is before the superior. This 
is an astute proof that Abraham was inferior to 
Melchizedek. 

V. 17. A priest for eternity. 

And v.18. For with this the former law is abolished. 
The law could not put away sin. 

V. 24. But this one. It is you alone. 

Hebr. 8, 1. who sits there. He sits at the right hand 
of God. 

V. 3: That he might sacrifice. The sacrifice of 
Christ. 

V.5. Which serve as an example. Here he teaches 
very well that everything was set up so that it might 
become an example of Christ. And this is such a 
place, in which the whole of Moses is pointed to 
Christ. 

V. 6. According to the testimony of Moses, the law 
was a shadow of Christ, in that he confesses that the 
entire Levitical service was set up according to the 
pattern he had seen on the mountain. Therefore the 
Jews should expect something different, which was 
promised in this figure. 

V. 10. | will give 2c. He proves his sentence with 
the saying of the holy scripture. 

V. 13 A new one. By promising the new, he 
cancels the old. 

Hebr. 9, 1. Here he refutes the objections. 

V. 8. so that the Holy Spirit would deutele or 
declare.

V. 9. and could not. The law has never been able 
to take away a sin. 

V. 23. So then the heavenly things had to be 2c. 
Here he seems to be speaking of a well-known truth, 
namely, that the sacrifices were not able to blot out 
sins in the conscience, but only to make a ceremonial 
atonement. True sins, however, are forgiven through 
Jesus Christ alone, without other sacrifices and 
ceremonies. 

V. 25. Again, we see that the law cannot take 
away sin. 

Hebr. 10, 1. For the law has the shadow. The law 
is only a shadow of the true eradication of our sins. 

V. 2. Otherwise the sacrifice would have. This is 
a perceptive conclusion. 

V. 3 A memory. What is the law? A remembrance 
of the sins that are to be forgiven by the promised 
Messiah. 

V. 8. Sacrifices and offerings. This is a bold 
psalm, which says that the ceremonies of the law are 
not pleasing to God in themselves, but are only to 
serve as customs for a time. 

V. 10. To which will. The will of the Father has 
been fulfilled through Christ. 

V. 18: But where the same forgiveness. This is 
also spoken very sharply against our mass priests 
and works saints. 

V. 19. So then we have. This is the decision 
together with an exhortation. 

V. 22. Sprinkled. This means baptism. 

V. 26. We have promoted. This is spoken against 
the measuring monkeys. 

Hebr. 11, 6. for he who wants to come to God. 
One must put faith in the promises of God. 

V. 7 Of that which was not seen. Invisible things. 

V. 8. Where he would go. Invisible things. 

V. 10. Waited for a city. Invisible things. 

V. 11. About the time of their age. Invisible things. 

V. 16. of a heavenly. Invisible things. 

V. 19. And thought. Invisible things. 

V. 20. Of the things to come. Invisible things.

V. 21. By faith Jacob blessed. Invisible things. 

V. 22. Of the exodus. Invisible things. 

Hebr. 12, 3. remember him. With this he presents 
Christ's example. 

V.17. For he found no room for repentance, that 
he might overflow such first birth: otherwise he might 
have found room for sin. 

V. 18. For you have not come 2c. That is’, it is no 
longer so terrible to draw near to God as formerly, 
but it is lovely. 

V. 23. and to the spirits, above Cap. 6, 1. and 1 
Cor. 3, 1. He wants to teach that they are still 
inexperienced in the doctrine of Christ. 

V. 28. with discipline and fear, as Ps. 

2, 11. says: "Serve the Lord with fear." Hebr. 13, 4. 
Marriage should be honest 2c., without adultery. 

V. 7 And follow their faith. He does not say: To 
works and deeds. This is a golden saying. 

V. 15. So let us 2c. The sacrifice of praise. 

Jac. 1, 2. consider it a joy. Patience is necessary 
for this. 

V. 4. Shall remain firm. So that it will not be made 
to waver. 

V. 5. The doctrine of prayer. 

V. 6. But he asks in faith 2c. This is the single best 
place in the whole epistle. 

V. 10: He who is rich. From the contempt of 
temporal goods. 

V. 12. Blessed is the man who endures 
temptation 2c. From the temptation. 

V. 13: A tempter to evil. This would be in the letter. 

V. 16. Do not err. One should beware of ambition 
in teaching. 

V. 19. Therefore. Why? 

V. 21: That which is planted in you. So others 
planted it, and not this Jacobus. 

V. 25 But he who sees through. Behold, he 
teaches nothing of faith, but only law. 

V. 27. A pure and undefiled worship 2c. He does 
not say: Our faith, but our works are a worship before 
God. 

Jac. 2, 2. for as in your assembly 





lung. Why would it be sinful to pay outward homage 
to a tyrant? 

V. 7. Do they not blaspheme? So they are to be 
dishonored and publicly shamed? 

V. 12: Thus speaketh and thus doeth. What a 
mess! 

V. 14. Can faith also make him blessed? About 
the connection of faith and works. 

V. 18. But someone would like to say. Better he 
would have said: Show me your works in faith, and | 
will show you my faith in works. Or one would have 
to regard this as the words of an opponent, who 
would say, "How can | know that the works of which 
you boast are works of faith? Show me this. Then | 
will see to it that | also show you faith by my works. 
Physician, help yourself first. Why do you throw the 
works of faith at me, since | see none of them in you? 

V. 19. That there is one God, and not much of 
Christ. 

V. 20: That faith without works is dead. How can 
he do good who has a dead faith? 

V. 21. Is not Abraham righteous by works? 2c. 
Where is this written? 

V. 22: That faith helps to work. So faith does not 
do the main work, but only helps to work, and the 
works are the most important authors. 

V. 22: And by works faith was made perfect. Yes, 
that rhymes fine! 

V. 24. That man is justified by works. This is 
wrong! 

V. 25. The same is true for the harlot Nah. Hebr. 
11, 31. says it differently. 

V. 26. For as the body without the spirit 2c. O, a 
beautiful likeness! Turn, freedom! 

V. 26. So also faith without works 2c. So works 
without faith are dead. 

Jac. 3, 1. Do not subject yourself to everyone. Si! 
if only you had also observed it. 

V. 2: But who is not missing in any word. Where 
are these?

V. 3. See the horses. Here he is talking about the 
use and abuse of the tongue. 

V. 4. See the ships 2c. V. 5. so, is also the tongue. 
Aesopi fable. 

V. 13: In meekness and wisdom, not in faith? 

Jac. 5, 16: The prayer of the righteous. This is one 
of the best sayings in the whole book, especially the 
example of Elijah praying. 

Epistle Jude, v. 5: When he helped the people out 
of Egypt. He led them through the Red Sea by Moses, 
but afterwards he left the unbelievers to die in the 
desert. 1 Cor. 10, 5. 

V. 7. The same way as this 2c. Notice here, God 
punishes Sodom, which is an example to those who 
boast of a celibate life in sodomitic sins. 

V. 8. These dreamers are also like them. These 
are the chaste despisers of marriage. 

V. 10. Like the unreasonable 2c. 2 Petr. 2, 12. 

V. 13. The their own shame. Shameless people. 

V. 19: Those who make mobs, establish 
monasteries, and commit heresy. 

Revelation 4:4 Four and twenty chairs. Twice 
twelve, as it were, because the church was built of 
Jews and Gentiles. 

V. 11. Lord, you are worthy. This is a pure gospel. 

Revelation 5, 6. hour of a lamb. Here one saw the 
lamb of God, because at that time the doctrine of 
Christ was still pure. Below, the lamb can be seen 
again after the heresies of chapter 14 were 
conquered. 

Revelation 7:4, a hundred and four and forty 
thousand 2c. This same number of male virgins is 
found in Cap. 14. 

V. 7 Of the tribe of Levi. The tribe of Dan is omitted 
among these families. But his true name is found in 
the Roman pope, who is a right Dan, judge and 
lawgiver. 

Revelation 9:7 and on their heads like crowns 2c. 
These are the Arian-minded kings and princes. 

V. 12. A woe. The first woe.

been as it were nonsensical because of the 
supremacy.

V. 3. The seven thunders. The seven thunders are 
perhaps meant to indicate seven church 
congregations that are unanimous with them. 

Revelation 11:14 The other woe. The other woe. 

Revelation 11, 15. These are the kingdoms. 
Above it was said in chapter 10 that with the voice of 
the seventh angel everything should be finished. 
Therefore they rejoice as if it had happened, since it 
has hardly begun, as if the last time had approached, 
the mysteries of God had been completed, and the 
church had been abandoned to extreme destruction 
and final darkness. 

Revelation 11, 19. And the temple was 2c. Here 
the church and scripture is opened. 

Revelation 12:3 and had seven heads. He has not 
painted like this before. 

V. 9 This one is called the devil. He himself

Here the lamb returns that he saw above Cap. 5, 6.

is, all the saints. 

V. 2. who play on their harps. As above the four 
and twenty elders. 

V. 3. Without the hundred and four and forty

V. 4. for they are virgins.’ It sounds almost 
wonderful that he compares males to virgins. | hold 
that they are thus called, because they have not

spouses have adhered to Christ alone. Because it is 
not necessary to admit that husbands are defiled with 
their wives, because that would be as much as 
desecrating God's work, whereas Paul says Hebr. 13, 
4: "Marriage should be kept honest, and the marriage 
bed undefiled. Therefore, he understands this to 
mean the papal adultery, in which Christ cannot be 
served. 

V. 4: And they follow the Lamb. They follow the 
Lamb, that is, they rely solely on his word and do not 
want to know anything about any other additions. 

V. 6. He had an everlasting gospel. This gospel 
will not fall in the future.

V. 12. Here is patience of the saints. These are 
the martyrs of our time. 

V. 12: Here are those who keep the 
commandments. This saying goes against the 
statutes of men. 

V. 13: For their works follow them. They go ahead 
into the glory to which their works, which they 
themselves condemn as imperfect, are to follow. 
"Their works follow them,” which some understand of 
the endowments and devotions made after their 
death. Good. Works, they say, God will? regard as 
having been done after them. But if their works follow 
them, they will not be blessed because of them, but 
they are blessed because they die in the Lord. But to 
die in the Lord is to die in the faith of the Lord, and 
works follow after them. | hold that their works, when 
they die, shall be utterly rejected as unfit and 
heretical. But afterwards they shall be revealed as the 
best. And as they die and are saved by faith in the 
Lord, so shall their works be revealed in glory, 1 Peter 
3.

Lutherus had written about the picture in front of 
this chapter: This picture almost presents to me the 
defeat of the rebellious peasants. 

And in the image was written to the elder who sat on the rainbow: 
Magistratus, the authority. 


V. 14: He had a golden crown. This is the secular 
authority, as also above Cap. 6, 2. 3) the crowned 
reuter with a bow. For by the gospel the authorities 
have been raised again, but by the pope and 
peasants they have been suppressed. 

V. 15. And another angel. Gospel. 

V. 17 And another angel. Here it is not the secular 
authority that is meant, but a teacher of the church. 

V. 20. and the winepress was pressed outside the 
city, and the blood went 2c. There is a lot of blood 
involved. Would to God that this was about the Turks, 
but | care 2c. 

V. 20. By a thousand six hundred country lanes, 
that is, by six and forty of our German miles. That is 
about how far the peasants’ uproar extended. And if 
this peasant tumult is not meant, it is at least in the 
allegorical sense an illustration of a great defeat of the 
papacy. For such a bloodbath cannot naturally take 
place that would be two and fifty miles wide and three 
cubits high, and even if the blood of all men and 
animals would flow together. Therefore, this is an 
image of an imminent great judgment. 

Revelation 15:3 and sang the song. The word of 
the law and the word of grace. 

V. 3. just and true 2c. The voice of the gospel is: 
Christ alone makes righteous. 

V. 4: For you alone are holy. This applies against 
the religious and sectarians. 

V. 7. and one of the four beasts. The Gospel of 
John, Paul, Peter 2c. 

Revelation 16. The papists are very angry about 
this chapter. 

V. 3. and every living soul. Here the righteousness 
of works is condemned.

V. 4. and it became blood. The fleshly doctrine 
becomes blood. 

V. 8. f. The honor and glory of the pope are 
obscured. But they remain immovable. 

V. 10. f. The kingdom of the pope is covered with 
shame along with his spirit. 

V. 19. And from the great city 2c. The kingdoms, 
orders and sects of the godless papists. 

V. 21. great hail. This forms a book that has been 
written with great seriousness and emphasis against 
the pope and his kingdom. 

Revelation 17:1: The judgment of the great harlot. 
He does not show her her glory, but her judgment. 

Revelation 18:2 and a container of all unclean

V. 19. The first ground was a jasper. So each 
stone must have had 900 German miles and over. 
12,000 stadia amount to more than 350 German 
miles. The whole circumference of the city [, the 
length] taken four times, namely 48,000 [stadia], 
makes 1400 German miles. This may be a small 
town.

Foreword. 


To what has been said in the preface to the 

first part of this volume, we have only a few things to add here. In this part, too, the pieces originally written in Latin have almost without exception been newly translated into German, several dates have been corrected, and many improvements have been made in the text. We have retained the "Nachlese zu den sammtlichen Theilen der Hallischen Sammlung der Schriften Luthers" that Walch assigned to this volume, but have included eight numbers of it in the collection of letters in a suitable place, because four (namely Bedenken) actually belong there, but the other four are often referred to in letters. The last number of Walch's Nachlese, "Luthers Randglossen Uber die Bibel," has already been included in the eighth volume of our edition (see the preface to the eighth volume). On the other hand, we have added two pieces to the Nachlese, namely "Luther's Opinion of Augustine's Words: Accedat verbum ad elementum et fit sacramentum" and the so-called "twelve evangelical counsels of the papists,

illuminated by Luther. The former writing is (inappropriately) under the letters in Walch, the latter is missing in Walch. 

Only shortly before the completion of the typesetting and printing of the Nachlese did we receive the last two volumes of the Erlanger Briefwechsel, namely the ninth and tenth volumes. Therefore, we were not able to include the improvements and additions resulting from them in the work itself, but had to assign them to a supplement. 

With this volume, by God's grace, the reprinting of the complete writings of Luther by Dr. Joh. G. Walch is now complete; praise, glory and thanks be to God, who has faithfully assisted us in this great work for twenty-four years. May He grant that these glorious writings may also be diligently read, so that through the God-enlightened Luther we may ever better attain the right understanding of the writings given by God, and, like him, grasp and hold on to them in fervent faith. May God grant this for the sake of Jesus Christ, His dear Son, our Savior, amen.

The second part of Luther's letters. 


No. 1950a. 


Without date 1532. Outlines of a reflection on a religious peace to be established. 


Melanchthon wrote the articles, Luther wrote his opinion underneath. 


From the Cod. Palatinus, p. 17b. (Thus De Wette in the estate, without time determination.) Printed by Seidemann- De Wette, vol. VI, p. 137, who places it in the year 1532. 

Ph. M. 1. From Peace Throughout the Empire to a Concilium. Placet. D. M. L. 


2. that the Lutherans should remain as they are now, but that they make no further innovation. 

Item, that they do not revile pope, emperor, princes and lords any longer. D. M. L. Because the Lutherans should remain as they are, it follows that they should keep their doctrine, but that they should not otherwise revile the opposite. We will gladly do this, provided they also remain as they are and do not revile our doctrine. 


Ph. M. 3: That nothing be taken from the spiritual goods of the clergy. D. M. L. placet. God willing, that this part would not harm our or their clergy. P. M. 4. renewal of the land peace. M. L. hoc transit per se. 


P.M. 5 De utraque specie. That they, to appease the people, wanted to let go out through the whole empire to take one or two forms. M. L. If the secular authorities do not 

want to force anyone to either one or both forms, we 

are well satisfied. But that we should approve with teaching. It is impossible to give one form to be right. 

Let them take it on their consciences. P. M. 6. and 

where kais. Maj. considered something more. 

D. M. L. That Ferdinandus is Roman king, he is well worth. For if she were pure, she would not have been his wife, he says. 


Ph. M. 


(Wittenberg.) NO 1Y9UD. January 1, 1533. 


To Mrs. Dorothea Jorger. Luther has not yet received the 500 gilden that Mrs. Jorger wanted to send for the support of poor students of theology. He sends the desired will form. 


From v. Hormayr's Taschenbuch 1845, p. 190, in the Erlangen edition, vol. 53, p. XXIX and in De Wette- Seidemann's vol. VI, p. 138. 

To the noble, virtuous woman Dorothea Jérgerin, 

widow at Keppach, my favorable good friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Noble virtuous woman! As you wrote to me the next time and the same time about the 500 fl. that you enclosed in God's honor, | let you know that | had certain faithful people from Nuremberg in Linz demand it in response to your first letter and sent your handwriting along with it for greater faith. But what has come in between, | do not know. They have nothing to say about money or gold in Linz. Have we therefore sent your manuscript back in vain, or to Nuremberg to the city syndic, Mgr. Lazarus Spengler, from whom | certainly have it, either there at Nuremberg, or to be invested elsewhere; for it is my judgment that it should not be distributed individually, but annually, and that it should be used to help two persons and to order them to study in theology. But all this at your pleasure. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. On the new anniversary of 1533. 

Send you a note or form, as reported by Mgr Michael Stiefel, that you should request. Will take it for good. 

Your willing D. Martinus Luther. 


A Notel on the Form of a Christian Will for the Noble Lady Dorothea Jérgerin, widow. 

In the name of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. |, Dorothea Jérgerin, Lord Wolfgang Jérger, blessed knight, widow of the estate, make and establish my last will and testament, for the confession of my faith and for the testimony of my life, in the following manner: 


1794 


Letters from the year 1533. No. 1950d. 


1795 





First of all, | confess that | also want to remain (with God's help and grace) that | believe in God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus 2c. usque in finem. By this faith my dear Lord Jesus Christ has graciously taught me that | know how | am redeemed from sins, death and hell by His blood and death alone, and have not been able to pay for the lesser sins by my works or merit, but the more | have done to redeem sin or indulgence, the more | have angered God and despised His Son. And | am sorry that | have lain so long and deep in my own works of righteousness and other sins and blasphemies of my Lord Jesus Christ, blinded and deceived, but | am glad and thankful to him from the bottom of my heart for eternity, that he has delivered and relieved me from so many great errors, in which | am stuck, and still daily protects me from the false groups and spirits. And upon such faith and knowledge | have received from him, as a sign and assurance of such forgiveness of sins and redemption from death, the two seals or consort of baptism in my childhood, and moreover the holy sacrament of his body and blood, so that | have become certain and need not doubt, He is my gracious God and | am in grace before Him through His dear Son, our Lord, and not through my merit or good works, for | heartily and earnestly reject and renounce the blasphemy of Anabaptists and deceivers against these two holy sacraments, together with all error that strives, ever strived or may strive against this faith of mine, for such faith is the faith of all the saints and of all Christendom, and so | believe with them, and they (with) me, and by the same faith all have become holy and blessed with me, and | with them, and there is no other name nor faith in which one can become holy and blessed, but apart from this faith all is sin and condemned, it is called and glorified as holy it may be. In this: | commit my soul and spirit into the hands of my Lord Jesus Christ, and pray with all my heart that he will strengthen me in this and keep me firm and undefiled until the day of his coming, for | want to leave such a confession behind me, and 





Then | will depart from this pitiful valley and come to my end, helped by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with the Father and the Holy Spirit, praised and blessed be one God forever and ever, amen. 

Secondly, | command, leave and provide, as much as is due to my motherly office, the same Gospel and faith to my dear children, so that God may now graciously and abundantly bless us, and | ask and admonish them out of all motherly faithfulness (so that | may also gladly hand them over to my God as my spiritual children), that they would seek Him above all things, the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, to remain firm in the Gospel, to promote and increase it with all their heart, both among themselves and among their people and wherever they can, and to be careful that mammon is not dearer to them than not to partake of and enjoy the holy blood of Christ, for everything that is deprived of the blessing that the blood of Christ sprinkles upon us through His holy Gospel is eternally cursed and maligned before God. 

Thirdly, | also urge them and command them in accordance with their motherly duty to hold fast to brotherly love and unity, and not to be moved by one against the other to ill-will, discord or disfavor, but whether there is cause for displeasure by words or deeds, For God, who does not lie, says Himself that brotherly love and unity are the greatest treasure on earth, and He wants to give happiness and salvation there, as He promises in Psalm 133. For there is no good nor wealth so great that it does not finally dissolve where the brothers are divided, as Christ himself says that a kingdom perishes when it is divided among itself. Again, the good is not so small where people live together in unity; it must grow and be increased. All this is the reason why God promises blessing, happiness and salvation in the above Psalm where brothers live together. He does this and keeps it. Again, he gives vain curses, misfortune and destruction, where people live disunited, hopeful and proud among themselves. 

Fourthly, although my dear daughters have granted themselves against my dear sons 


1796 


| have the right to divide the maternal goods, but because | have the power to ordain in their life, it is my will and opinion (to avoid future cause for impatience or disagreement as much as possible) that these maternal goods be divided equally. 

Doctor Martinus' manuscript. 


No. 1951. 


(Wittenberg.)January 2. January 1533. To Nikolaus Hausmann in Dessau. 


Luther apologizes for his long silence, sends his sermon held at W6rlitz and reports news. 


The original is in Dessau. Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 165 us in Cod. IlkInast. 94 Lidi. OukIpN. Printed by Schitze, vol. Il, p. 279 (from the Hanische Sammlung in Kiel) and by De Wette, vol. IV, p. 430. German by Walch, vol. XXI, 1402. 


To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Nic. Hausmann, the extremely faithful servant of Christ in Dessau, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord! The 

opportunity to write to you, my esteemed husband, has already been snatched away from me three times, also very much against my will. For | have been constantly overwhelmed with writing and other work (agendo), as is evidenced both by the books and the prefaces with which we have filled this Leipzig fair. Therefore, for the sake of Christ, | ask you to interpret this delay for the best.

| wish you happiness that your indisposition is overcome and a better state of health is restored. Christ keep you healthy and as a prayer for me. 

The sermon | gave at W6rlitz has been printed, and | am sending it herewith. For | believe that you already have the other books that have recently been published, because | am firmly convinced of the diligence of Magister Georg, indeed, | have tested them, but if there is anything that you do not yet have, then show it to me, that is what | ask. Christ, as one hears here, has his enemy,1) the: Schreier zu Leipzig, just killed in the pulpit and in the middle of his blasphemy. 

In Hamburg, a canon who particularly hated the gospel killed himself, and at the same time, in the same city, a sacramentarian threw himself into a vain well, and even though the water was not deep enough, and people ran to the well and called on Christ, he still willingly bent backwards and suffocated himself, despising the remedies that were lowered for him. His speech was quite similar to that of Judas: | have deceived many, therefore there is no hope. So shall your enemies perish, O Lord, since they knowingly and deliberately make no end nor measure of their lust, and run against God with their necks erect. 

You will recommend me to your very good and sincere princes, to whom | will write in confidence when | have gained leisure. Christ be with you. My Lord Kathe greets you respectfully and asks that you support her with your prayers, since she is close to giving birth. On the second of January, 1533, yours, Martin Luther.

Grace and peace in Jesus Christ, who was born and circumcised for us, my venerable Father Martin! |, too, have not been able to write, since | have become dull due to the illness that has weighed down my head, but | have resumed preaching, even though | have not been completely restored, irritated by the people's demands, and in the hope that my stomach will get better. For | feel great relief from the medicine of Doctor Augustin; may the Lord Jesus prosper to the remedies applied. | have certainly obeyed the Doctor in all things, the whole prescribed prescription, and | would not have regained health in any way except by the medicine taken, so much were the powers of the stomach exhausted, | know not by what intemperance; perhaps the sudden change of food and the difference of drink gave some occasion, but it was the will of the Lord, who pleased to kill the body thus, and to grind it to excess, that | might learn to 1) watch daily, and expect the Lord when he comes to the wedding. For no one can understand the power of the word of the cross, unless he has been so afflicted and afflicted. It is through this affliction that one attains to patience. 

So that | am not ungrateful for the gift | have received for the new year, venerable father, | am sending the letter of the imperial majesty, Carl V, to the pope, concerning the meeting of a council, which Doctor Turk, the chancellor of the bishop of Magdeburg, has communicated to my princes, but with this condition that the letter should not be published, not without cause. Due to weakness of the main | could neither read nor improve it. You will forgive the writer if he should have erred somewhere. You will keep this copy with you, but it would also like to be shown to the highly famous gentlemen, namely Philip, Doctor Jonas and Pommer and perhaps other faithful people, also Cruciger. Our princes fear danger. But in fact, you know, the princes have not yet seen the wise man, Sirach. |, however, am very inflamed with love to read the discussion about the German situation. The news has frightened many, venerable Father. Greet all the aforementioned highly famous men in the Lord, and in Christ be well with your pregnant wife, whom | wish the happiest possible birth through the blessing of Christ, amen. |

To his venerable and exceedingly dear father in Christ, D. Martin Luther, preacher of the church at Wittenberg 2c. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | give you the greatest and eternal thanks, my dearest Father in Christ, that you have finally completed the Summaries of the Psalter for us, 2) and | pray to God, our Father, without ceasing, that He may also make us use what He has deigned to give us through you, His servant, according to His immeasurable goodness, that is, that He may not, through the so great quantity of spiritual and truly heavenly goods, make this so precious treasure seem small to us. O we blessed and in truth children of God, to whom it has been granted on earth in the flesh, in sin, when we are still wandering in darkness and in the shadow of death, not only to behold the divine and heavenly love and the light of the highest majesty, that is, the highest wisdom and the truth of the highest God, but also to carry it in our own hearts not differently than in a lamp.

Hail! Forgive me, dearest Spalatin, for the brevity of this letter. | am about to leave for the visitation. Our dearest father, D. Martin, has sometimes earnestly exhorted in his sermon to public respectability and Christian decency, that no one should enter into a new marriage after the death of a spouse, as some did at that time, immediately after two or three months. We, as much as there is in us, gladly observe this respectability and exhort that it be observed, but from time to time some of the

To the man to be highly honored in the Lord, Mr. Georg Held, Christ's disciple, his brotherly friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ! The very good man, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, has told me about your sincere godliness in the Lord, dearest brother, although it is still weak and still very attached to the reputation of the pope and council; therefore | am not surprised about you. For |, too, having lived as an Augustinian for almost twenty years, have been so entangled and completely immersed in the same opinion that you are in, through long custom and habit, that if God had not torn me out of it with obvious force (of which Nicolaus told you), | could perhaps never have been dissuaded by words, although everything was exceedingly certain to me. It was so difficult to put the word into practice and to dare to do myself what | had taught as certain. How much less is it to be wondered at that you, who (as | hear) in so many years have become accustomed to this way of life, and have not (like me) been forced to daily assert the word of God against it, are so minded. Therefore, do not despair, but do this: pray from your heart that the Lord Jesus may grant you to see this divine dialectic, which teaches that Christ is something other than Moses, the Pope and the whole world, yes, something other and greater than our conscience, which is nevertheless more valid than Moses and the Pope. For if Moses and your conscience, which torments and accuses us by the law, must be believed, how much more must we believe him, the Lord over all things, Christ, who said, "Believe," and again, "In vain do they serve me with the commandments of men." There may be innumerable popes and innumerable conciliarities here, but what are they against Christ? certainly a drop against the sun. But this you will learn in time by praying, for it is too great to be grasped suddenly by a mind that has been used to something far different for a long time. | speak as one who has 


Therefore, | believe you easily.

Now it is ever the truth that such two things (old habit and present temptation of great men) may well move stronger Christians, neither of whom E. F. G. may be; but nevertheless we must 





We will learn by and by (if we cannot do it quickly and suddenly) that Christ is more, and God the Father wants to hear him above all. A council or pope may have the Holy Spirit and order something by his inspiration, but Christ has no devil (Joh. 8), | will remain silent that he has the Holy Spirit without measure (Joh. 1), but all holy apostles, prophets, church, council must have only one part and first fruits of the Holy Spirit, Rom. 8. 1 Cor. 12. If then all prophets, apostles, church, ooneilis, set something, and Christ over it or against it, then Christ, as the one who has the Spirit without measure, even distributes it himself, should be more valid than his saints, who, so deeply unequal to him, do not give the Holy Spirit, but must receive it in part. Therefore | ask the Father of all mercy, to let E. F. G. alone learn the few things and well consider, that Christ and his word is higher, greater, more and more certain, than a hundred thousand holy fathers, ooncilia, churches, popes 2c., for they are called in the Scriptures All sinners and erring sheep, Ps. 119.

Dignitaries and scholars! In our city of Nuremberg and in other places of our jurisdiction, this (and in our opinion not un-Christian) practice has been held in the churches for some time, so that on feast days the common sermon has been preached in the pulpits, likewise over the altar before the communion of the body and blood of Christ, that the preacher or verger has made a common open confession and after the end of it has announced absolution or release to the assembled people 2c. which, however, some of our church servants, half of us unknowing, have abandoned and dropped, and have also indicated to us, upon our annotations having occurred because of this, that such common absolution is not useful, but rather harmful, and that private absolution alone is good and salutary.

he same discontinuation of the common absolution is ighly complained of, for reasons that many pious hristian persons, who are not convenient to go to the oly sacrament every Sunday or week and to receive he private absolution, would like to hear the common ublic absolution from the pulpits and the altar as a appy, joyful message, in which pardon of their sins nd God's gracious mercy would be proclaimed to hem, and have received not a little doubt and disquiet f their consciences by such a postponement and efutation of the common release, moreover, that ccording to the great amount of people in our city, and ith the few parishes found therein, it is not yet well ossible to examine every person before receiving the oly sacrament and to communicate the private bsolution. Besides this, we are also told that in the lectorate of Saxony the common absolution is still olerated and used as a salutary thing, which gives any in our country all the greater reason to complain © much more about the disgusting opposition. owever, since we are not inclined to do or permit nything in these and other cases, which might nterrupt the honor of the divine word, weaken the faith, nd violate Christian love and unity, it is our most urgent request to your dignity that they give us their advice and discretion in this case, But before that, for what Christian reason the common absolution should not be good, but rather harmful, and therefore most reasonably to be omitted rather than used, let us know in writings, so that in this we may all the more quiet our lown and ourselves, and do everything that is according to God's word and Christian, and allow nothing troublesome. We want to earn this for your dignity quite willingly. Date Tuesday (Erchtag) April 8, 1533.

To the honorable and wise, mayors and council of 

the city of Nuremberg, our favorable lords. 

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. Honorable, wise, favorable lords! To E. W. We have discussed these questions among ourselves, and do not know how to punish and reject the public common absolutio, for this reason, because the preaching of the holy gospel itself is basically and actually an absolutio, in which forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to many persons in general and publicly, or to one person alone, publicly or secretly; Therefore the absolutio may be used publicly in common, and also especially secretly, as the preaching may be done in common or secretly, and one may comfort many in common, or one especially alone; For although not all believe in it, the absolutio is not to be rejected, for all absolutio, whether it be common or particular, must be understood as requiring faith and helping those who believe in it, just as the gospel itself proclaims forgiveness to all men in all the world, and excludes no one from this absolutio; but it nevertheless requires our faith and does not help those who do not believe in it, and must nevertheless remain the universalis. But that here it may be considered that no one will desire the private absolutio, if one has the common one and lets it remain, to this we say that it has the form in right concern, that the consciences nevertheless need this special consolation; For the consciences must be taught that the consolation of the gospel is for each one in particular, and for this reason the gospel must be applied to each one in particular through Word and Sacrament, as you, as those of understanding, know that each conscience _ in particular disputes whether this great grace, which Christ beckons, also belongs to it. It is easy to understand, 


1) Thus the Corp. ref.; De Wette: "how far". 


that the private absolutio should not be dropped alongside it, and this applicatio 2) also shows more clearly the understanding of the gospel and the power lof the keys; for very few people would know how to use the common absolutio or accept it if they did not remember this applicatio alongside it, that they should also accept the common absolutio as if it were every special one, and that this very thing is the gospel's own office and work, certainly forgiving sins by grace. For these reasons we hold that the common absolutio is not to be rejected, nor is it to be dismissed, and that lone should nevertheless receive the private applicatio s[ive] absolutio alongside it. God preserve E. W. always graciously. We are always ready to serve E. W. willingly. Date Wittenberg, Friday after Easter Day [April 18] Anno 1533.

Nevertheless, according to your request, | have asked Martin Seldener in Nuremberg through Mr. Lazarum Spengler and reminded him that he still wanted to demand and receive it with a prescription, as is proper, to send us to Nuremberg.

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, wise, dear gentlemen and good friends! M. Johannes Dachau, your city child, has asked me to do this writing to you, and indicated that you would be inclined to extend his stipend, which he has had up to now, if he would send me a letter. Since, in my opinion, it is not badly conceived, and has no other obstacle, except that it is ordered to extend "one" for a certain number of years, | think that in such a case it would be possible to extend it to him for a while, in order to improve and complete his studies, especially since it is not unacceptable to you and you are inclined to do so.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Georg Spalatin, bishop and servant of the churches of Christ in Meissen, his extremely dear [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! This pastor of Dobrun, my dear Spalatin, has obtained a gift from our prince as well as from the visitators, which the sequestrators are to present to him. Therefore we send him to you, and ask that you help according to your office and see to it, as much as you can, that he receives what he has asked for and obtained. For there are no sequestrators with us, and he has lost almost everything that is his through the conflagration of his parish. Therefore, it is now up to you (since the prince so desires) to compensate for the conflagration with this gift, namely with that with which he was given by the prince, so that the poor man will not be forced to wander about without a certain residence, and to leave the parish, leaving it orphaned without a successor. Give my regards to your Kathe, from whom | hear that she is pregnant. Therefore, | wish her luck and ask for a happy delivery. Farewell in Christ. May 12, 1533, = your Martin Luther.

Grace and peace in Christ! Accept favors and make reciprocal favors, as you do, my dear Spalatin. You like to recommend many poor little priests to us, so we like to recommend such people to you, where it is necessary 2c. Now the rumor has come here (there is nothing faster) that M.

For there is no vacancy with us as yet, otherwise we would have supplied him gladly and willingly. And there is no reason why you should perhaps shy away from it, if you have either heard something about his former behavior through rumor or remember it. He has become a different man and has been well tested by many plagues, 1) so that according to a very good testimony of many people he has also proved himself with us. Then, however much suspicion may work against him, this will benefit him and us all the more if he lives among us and near us, so that he may become more accustomed to our customs and traditions and have less opportunity to be deceived by others. For what is it to wonder if one learns to howl among wolves, and, as Paul says, that good customs are corrupted by evil talk. Do therefore as much as you can and will; but you will will as much as you love us. But you will love us as much as we love you, namely as a faithful and exceedingly high co-worker in the word in Christ, who will keep you and make you blessed to his glory, amen.

Duke Albrecht of Prussia to Luther. 


The Duke thanks Luther for his letter and regrets his sickness, which God may turn to good account. Given the size of the country, it is not possible to prevent the Sacramentarians from creeping in; given the thin population, it is also not advisable to expel them from the country, so that the country does not become even more desolate. Brismann and Poliander warned against them and taught against them, and the duke ordered that the Sacramentarians should neither teach nor preach in secret or in public. He allowed each one to believe for himself what he wanted to answer for on the last day. News about the Reformation in Riga and the surrounding area, with the request to send preachers there; repeated request for an interpretation of John 6.

For if this day should come before Michaelmas, you sin nothing who believe and say this; if it should not come, we sin nothing who believe that it can come at any hour. For whoever believes that he can come at any hour also believes that he can come before Michaelmas. Now if we are perhaps mistaken in what we do not know, and confess that we do not know whether he will certainly come before Michaelmas, as you say, then this error is without danger for us, just as all your certain knowledge, if you have any, is without danger for you. Why do you torture yourself for the sake of such a thing, which is safe and without danger on both sides? | tell you that this agitation of yours arouses the suspicion in me that Satan may desire to see you. For he who excites your passion (affectum) so without cause can also confuse your mind without anything factual lying at the bottom (sine re). 2) Therefore, | beg you to put away this agitation of the mind and come to us, and not leave or change our old friendship.

| will answer your correct and godly letters and requests briefly, as much as | have time and leisure. | have experienced your zeal for Christ and Christian discipline with great joy, but in this so gloomy time, which is also not yet sufficiently suitable to accept discipline, | would not dare to advise such a sudden innovation. "We must let the peasants drink a little, and give way to a drunken man with a cartload of hay. It will be convenient, because we do not like to drive it" by law. It is a great thing, not in itself, but for the sake of the people who have the power to stir up trouble for us, which cannot be quelled, since we are a root in the thirsty land and have not yet grown into branches and leaves. In the meantime, | would advise that we begin gradually and in a small way, as we are doing here, to first keep from the sacrament of the Lord's Supper those who seem worthy of the ban; 4) For such an excommunication, which forbids worldly things, we may not take upon ourselves in any way, first, because we have no right to it, and it applies only to those who do not want to be true Christians; secondly, because at this time the great (major) ban cannot even be brought within our power, and we would be ridiculous if we undertook it before we had the strength to do so. For what you seem to hope, that the execution may be done by the prince himself, is very uncertain, nor do | want the secular authorities to be involved in this task, but to be separated from it in every respect, so that the difference between the two regiments may exist rightly and surely. Accept this free and certainly brotherly good will of mine for the best, just as | am disposed toward you in love. Christ rule you by his Holy Spirit for ever and ever, Amen.

A dispute had arisen among the clergy in Nuremberg over a general formula of absolution to be read from the pulpit, which Osiander opposed. In this letter, Luther exhorts them to unity.

Grace and peace in Christ. Dear men and exceedingly dear brethren in Christ! If | have ever desired and asked of the Lord that a well-sounding and effective speech be put into my mouth, | ask above all that this letter of mine be made effective and sweet in your ears and hearts by the power of the Holy Spirit. It is not possible to say with how much pain my 


1) Probably the "Responsibility of the imposed riot of Duke Georgen" 2c. St. Louis edition, vol. XIX, 1826. 2) This time determination results from the following letter. 





| have perceived in your minds that a discord has arisen among you, who are ordained angels of peace and salvation in this excellent place. For, to say nothing of the disturbance and harm to your native church, how much trouble do you think will result from it for other churches? what boasting, what rejoicing, what triumphs will the adversaries on both sides, the Papists and the Sacramentarians and_ the Anabaptists, catch for themselves from these mischiefs of yours and throw up high! For this morsel, this delight of his wickedness, the hound of hell obtains through you. And, as much as Christ should love me, as much as | can recognize and judge from the matter itself and from your letters (for | speak quite freely in such great distress and danger), this discord does not come from this present matter, namely private and public absolution. One can notice it, one can notice it badly (don't pretend, don't conceal it), that before there were some old impulses among you, and that the sparks are nourished and hidden in the tinder, which now, since a little breeze blows and a small, insignificant occasion is given, strive to rise to a conflagration. If in due time, as Isaiah [Cap. 50, 4] says, there had been a learned and healing tongue, it would have extinguished them, as Sirach says, with a spout, whereas now, blown out and inflamed by the tongues of many, they are very severely subdued. For if you had been One Heart and One Soul in the Lord before this, and the bond of love perfect, it would have been impossible that these little offences should count for so much as they, alas! do. For how often does a finger injure an eye, a tooth injure a tongue, a hand injure another hand! And yet these members, concerned for each other, suffer these insults from each other. And you know very well that the words and deeds of another, however good and praiseworthy they may be, are severely disregarded by a bitter and suspicious mind. For such are also the things of God, whatever and however our Opinions or consciences may be: so that we may not be able to

consider as useful to life what is fatal, and as fatal what is useful to life. How much more does a sick mind take the words and deeds of another brother in a wrong way (ad iniquam partem), especially when they are somewhat reprehensible and obviously faulty. But meanwhile, where is the empress and mistress of these impulses and movements, love? Of which it is gloriously praised by the Holy Spirit [1 Pet. 4:8.]: "Love also covers the multitude of sins," and again [Jac. 2:13.]: "Mercy boasts against judgment,” and again [Luc. 6:37.]: "Forgive, and you will be forgiven." Will we then, who preach love, mercy, and forgiveness to others, leave nothing of love behind for ourselves? will we not bear one another's burdens? will we not do all that mercy may boast against judgment? Or does it give us pleasure to hear the word: Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum [It is disgraceful for a teacher when an accusation falls on himself]? Yes, what is frightening is that we, who are teachers of grace, arouse the wrath of God against ourselves, when we, giving in to our passions, strike through this anger and dangerous and hateful discord the weak brethren for whom Christ died. For this is one of the chief things of original sin, that we demand justice from our brother more than mercy from us, while mercy must be demanded from us more than justice from our brother. "It is said, Love shall go for the right and above the right." Now if this order cannot be kept, then right must be abolished from the foundation, rather than that right should be allowed to be equal to mercy, or to contend or quarrel with it, just as Christ abolished our judgment from the foundation, and the handwriting that testified against us, before he would have allowed the same to be equal to or preferred to his love against us. And it is rightly said: The highest right is the highest injustice. It is the right or the judgment absolutely and absolutely condemned, both with God and with men, 





when it goes beyond its limits and wants to rule over or be equal to love or mercy, for law should serve love, not rule over it. Otherwise it is one of the four evils that make a country restless (as Solomon says [Prov. 30:21-23.]), namely, a servant when he becomes king, or a maidservant when she becomes heir to her wives. Therefore, for the sake of Christ, for the sake of all that we have in common in him, and for the sake of our fellowship in him, make diligent and faithful efforts that by patience, humility, and forgiveness among yourselves this evil may be healed among you. At least look at us, and stop heaping pain upon pain, because you cannot deny that your wound is our wound, and that if you are hindered and afflicted by Satan, we will also be hindered and afflicted. For you are our crown and glory in that so excellent place. Remember how great power of enemies we have to endure, and that from devils and men of every kind. Let us not ourselves be bitten and devoured among ourselves by this exceedingly sad turmoil of spirit, which we should hold out our hands to one another in unanimous spirit, since we even have to fight with danger of life against so many, so vigilant, so tireless enemies day and night. And since they rejoice when one of us falls or is wounded, how much will they triumph when they see such a great church cast down by mutually inflicted and more than moderate (civilibus) wounds! This is what Satan would like, that we, who have hitherto remained unconquered by all his gates, should now fall without his hand and while he sleeps, by our own hands and inward wars. May the Father of all life and comfort prevent this, amen. 

Therefore, unless the Spirit gives you something better, my advice would be that you sharply distinguish between this matter and your peace. And although there is no danger to the church, if you leave this matter subdued (God grant, extinguished) for a while, until at a safer and better time, and with minds fortified in peace and united by love, you may discuss itas you wish.

But at this time, when the minds are so agitated, it is a poison to discuss or touch this sore or ulcer. Then, when the public absolution, which was the end desired by this disputation, has asserted itself and triumphed, follow the example of the Athenians, and let a pardon and forgetting (amnesty) take place, since here again there is no danger for the church. And this you clearly owe, so that you do not prefer this matter to peace and your and all people's love. Imagine that Christ himself is bodily present in your midst, and learn from his countenance which of the two must be preferred in this matter. He will undoubtedly address your hearts in this way, perhaps with his eyes: What do you do, dearest children, whom | have redeemed by my blood, born again by my word, that you should love one another? You know that this is the mark of my disciples. Lay this thing down, or cast it upon me, and | will watch. There is no danger in this thing resting or even dying. There is no harm to my church if public absolution prevails, but there will be danger if you disagree and bite among yourselves. Here you will not only cut my unstitched skirt, but you will cut and tear my body. Do not grieve the Spirit, by whom you are sealed for the day of salvation [Eph. 4:30]. Do not deprive the holy angels in heaven of their joys. Do not trouble and vex your brethren and the whole church. Do not make yourselves ridiculous before my enemies and yours. Do not increase Satan's joys and triumphs. You already have enough evil to suffer for the sake of my name. Or am | not more to you than all things, all affectations, all impulses? Do then some words of a brother or an unjust grievance penetrate deeper and hang more firmly than my wounds, my blood, than even the whole Savior Jesus Christ? Surely this, and far more beautiful and abundant, his exceedingly beautiful eyes, redder than wine [Gen. 49:12], will speak to you, if you only let him stand in your midst and, with your eyes fixed on his countenance, speak of the matter. 





and be silent to your excitements. For after this silence, what else will he say but: "Peace be with you; do not be afraid"? Then he will show you his wounds and cover your sores and bruises, and so you will all have salvation and joy. 

| would write more, but much more | would like to use the oral word with you, having the confidence that | would achieve something with Christ's help. But since you are men to whom God has given to know His wisdom, | do not despair that you will recognize the opportunity given by this letter to be wiser than | can write and say. But at the same time, because you are also human, and not yet risen from death, it will not seem miraculous to you if something human has happened to you, but has nevertheless been human up to now, and does not cease to be human, and does not turn into something devilish. It is a human thing to be offended, but it is added [Eph. 4:26.], "Sin not." To be offended is human, but not to want to be reconciled is devilish; but not to be offended or not to offend is angelic, or, which is the same thing, Christian. Since we have not yet reached that point, it is reasonable that we, as beginners, as it were, and as people who have the beginnings of Christians, if we have not avoided offenses or have not borne them with patience, should both gladly forgive one another and humbly ask forgiveness, wrapping our lives in that petition: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us." May the Lord Jesus himself, our peace and mercy, make you joyful, that is, may he give you to overcome one another by peace and mercy, and to consume your strife and dissension by the furnace of love, amen.

To the worthy and highly venerable man, Wenceslaus Link, the faithful and sincere servant of the Word in the Church at Nuremberg, his exceedingly dear brother in Christ. 


Grace and peace in Christ! | have written a general letter to all of you who are servants of the Word, dearest Wenceslaus, and | have written it from my heart, God is my witness. For | am very much moved by your so persistent discord, and | ask you to allow me to say what is my opinion. You with your party follow the truth godly and loudly, which brings you enough favor with God and favor with men. The other, 1) | confess, follows his inclination more than enough, as is evident, and | myself do not approve of everything that is his; this is precisely what | am writing to him. But because he is a good and in all things upright man, and has not yet entirely stripped this flesh (as we are among ourselves), and is tempted by Satan! kaun, as we also are: therefore | beseech thee for Christ's sake, that thou mayest at last overcome the thought, and in the love of Christ himself, who said [Matt. 23:11], "He that is greatest among you shall be least," may you put on the form of the least, after the example of Christ; begin first to greet and address him kindly. Thou knowest that word of Solomon [Prov. 15:1.], "A mild answer quencheth wrath, but a harsh answer stirreth up anger." "A good word finds a good place." Who knows whether his anger and his displeasure will not be soothed by this cur? But you will do this not only according to the right of love, but, if |am not mistaken, also out of the duty of conscience. For | suspect from the articles you have sent me that you have paid too much attention to his sermons. Not that | say this is true, but that you did not admonish him about this matter before it was reported to others. May

he may after all be sophistical (captiosus), as one complains, yet grace with GOD and favor with men must be enough for you. What is the use of oppressing a brother who has already oppressed himself through displeasure with men and through his offense with GOD? You stand and are upright; he has fallen and lies down. What is the use of rejoicing and applauding over his fall? since you must rather be eager for him to be raised up and fortified with you. For | hope that he will not be incorrigible if he is asked humbly, modestly and reverently, as is proper. For if you continue to act harshly against harshly in this way, you will cause us and yourselves great trouble, because he cannot be thrown away and suppressed in this way without causing you great harm and annoyance. Forgive me for writing so freely, but freely in brotherly confidence, for | trust in your sincerity and our old love. The Lord be with you, Amen. On Sunday after Margaret [July 20] Anno 1533.

Thanks for the sympathy for Luther's state of health and for the medicine he sent. In response to Huber's inquiry, Luther said that the Lord's Supper should not be taken secretly in the houses, but rather in neighboring villages, or that the council and the preachers should be informed beforehand that it would be taken in the Lutheran manner.

| was swindled into blaming not only natural weakness, but also the devil and his arrows, and | wanted to leave. But God's power has been strong in me over my conceit, and according to His wisdom, to make the living out of the dead, has also refreshed me again through your and all the brothers’ prayers. Our physicians think that where | have the: Our doctors think that if | can keep open the flow in the left leg, as it has been up to now (in which they work), then it should give solution to the head. | believe so, but | still have to be provided with the arrows of the archmurderer. Enough of that. 

Caspar Huber has written to me for advice as to whether one might not (because the desire, so long departed, is almost great) give and take the sacrament in houses, because one cannot get it publicly, especially in such a way that those who teach there or have been in office before are sufficient. Truly, in this alone | am concerned that, because the Zwinglians rule among you and the papists lurk, an unpleasantness may result that we do not see now, and because necessity does not demand such a thing, nor are you ever forced to make such a_ special communion. Afterwards, your conscience might be challenged and grieved because of such an undertaking, for it takes strong, courageous Christians to undertake it. But | would like you, where it is possible, if there is a town or village nearby where our Sacrament is administered, to take it there; if this is not possible, and you would dare to do it, then it would be my advice that you report it to the council and their preachers that you intend to give and take it in houses. Then you would find what they could suffer and what you could do. That would be better than to begin it beforehand and then have to wait and see what they might suffer or what you might do. For if you hear that they want to suffer, you are safer and free to do so; but if they do not want to suffer, you have already confessed your faith and their disfavor on your neck, and the struggle will be as great before you do it as it would be after you had done it, and yet you are safe, because you have desired it publicly and confessed it, which is all the better than that you should do it, without first having confessed it, behind their knowledge and against their will. However, if you

To his extremely dear brother in the Lord, M. Georg Spalatin, servant of Christ at Altenburg. Grace and peace in Christ! | recommend this priest, my dear Spalatin, to you. You see in these letters of his what he desires. Oh about the exceedingly shameful ingratitude of our time! What else can we hope or desire but that the right Judge and our Redeemer should come. Everywhere in oun country the nobles and the ballers are conspiring against the gospel, and yet they are enjoying the freedom of the gospel in the most hopeful way. Why should we be surprised that the papists have persecuted us? "Here God will judge." There is no news. May the Lord be with you. Greetings to your rib, 1533, the day after Bartholomew [Aug. 25].

Grace and peace! Your sickness, my dear brother in Christ, is very close to me. Christ will stand by you and not only make you well, but he will also give you the courage to endure everything that is connected with this illness. For he loves you, because you love him and speak and suffer for him in this exceedingly wicked, not only exceedingly ungrateful world. Be strong and despise the one who hates you and the one you preach, Christ Jesus. | am so busy by God's grace that | could not write a letter to you this morning through your Aurelius, as | would have liked. Duke George has published a book which is in accordance with his character and purpose. 2) But thanks be to God, who has brought this foolish heart to the public. This is what he has earned so far by this constant persecution of the word that he, as his own accuser and judge, is forced to shamefully drag himself through before the whole world as a liar, blasphemer, and blasphemer of God. He will be answered 3) ina judgment not for him but for us.

(Nuremberg.) September 27, 1533. 


The Nuremberg Council to Luther and the other Wittenberg theologians. (Regest.) 


Since the dispute over absolution had still not been settled, the council had forbidden the preachers to preach on this subject and had ordered them to submit their opinions in writing. The opinion of the council and the local pastors, rectors and preachers has never been to abolish private absolution or to allow others to do away with it. The dispute revolved solely around whether, in addition to private absolution, general absolution should also be used in a divine and Christian manner, or whether it should be removed from the churches, since, according to Andreas| Osiander, it was useless, harmful and ungodly, and should not be| an absolution. Osiander's record aroused the suspicion that the city of Nuremberg was acting contrary to the Augsburg Confession by permitting common absolution, the use of which| no one had yet been able to judge to be unjust. Now the council requests a renewed examination of the question in dispute.

Peter and the other ministers of the Gospel at Erfurt, his exceedingly the dear friends and brothers in Christ]. 

Grace and peace of God in Christ. Venerable, highly learned, dignified, special favorable gentlemen and friends! In response to your letter, which you confidentially sent to us in all good faith, and also in response to verbal reports, which he 2) Aegidius 3) further reported to us according to the content of your writing and instruction, we have, as much as God has granted us in His haste, and have considered these matters, and inform you that, after you have confidentially asked and requested our advice and concern, we do not consider it a good idea or know how to advise that you should leave the place in part or in whole. For what he tells Aegidius de vocatione [of the appointment], which may grieve you, shall not err you. For your vocation has been done on oath with the knowledge of the magistrate, councillors and guardians, who have ratified and promised to administer it, as it must be proved, if necessary, or, if it has now been denied by the repugnant out of hatred, it is certainly true before God that your consciences are free and safe. And even if the papist part of the council or hostes Evangelii [the enemies of the gospel] now deny or dispute your vocation, it is not the whole council or community, but only some who are opposed to the gospel. Nevertheless, your profession exists, which is done openly, not in an assassin-like manner. Nevertheless, you are true shepherds of Christ's sheep, who love your doctrine and preaching, know the voice of the true Shepherd of Christ in you, and follow it. Let us suppose that an ungodly father had 30 or 40 children, all of whom were electives.

If the Father, who by divine right of the fourth commandment has power over them, 1) were in the magistrate's office, forbidding them the gospel, they would choose a preacher and shepherd for them, contrary to the Father's will; although this is not the case. Until now, the ordinary magistrate has not forbidden you to preach, nor has he exerted any power over you, even though they, as the papists among them, persecute you, want to do you harm by all kinds of subsidies and evil deceptions; even though they make your pay meager and meager enough, even though they completely despise the dear Lord Christ in you, and let you suffer hunger, misery and hardship. Behold, dear lords and brethren, what a wicked world it is now, and that such contempt is shown even to the pious, faithful pastors and preachers. It is like an ugly, horrible sight of the last times and the last fury and wrath of Satan to look at and to hear. But, dear sirs, it is true that in the time of the apostles, and soon afterward, all the evil vipers and enemies had a very bad time: they finally perished; but Christ and the gospel remained. 

Therefore, dear lords and brethren, we have a heartfelt sympathy for your concern and present affliction, and with what we may be able to comfort or help you, you and your church in Erfurt shall find us willing. If you have had patience so far through God's grace and strengthening, and have also suffered with the Gospel, have patience for another year or a little while. God the Lord will strengthen you with rich divine comfort against all that you suffer for the sake of the Gospel, and we with you and with many others. God will give the ungrateful, as well as the persecutors, their certain, unmissed right reward. You know what the apostles had to comfort themselves with.

|, D. Martinus, have not omitted before this time to exhort the preachers in general and especially the preachers (although | was not really aware of Mr. Osiandri's opinion at that time) to unity and peace. And because E. W. sent us both writings to look at, we have read and considered them diligently, and |, D. Martinus, have written again to Mr. Osiandrum, and informed him of my opinion of this matter. God grant that it may serve for peace and unity, as we hope. For we do not doubt that both parties mean it faithfully and with a good Christian heart, and seek nothing else in this matter but common amelioration. 

And to E. W.'s question this is our answer and opinion. W.'s question this is our answer and opinion: Although we consider private absolution to be very Christian and comforting, and that it should be preserved in the church, for the reason we have written to E. W. before and elsewhere, we nevertheless cannot and will not weigh down the consciences so severely, as if there should be no forgiveness of sins except through private absolution alone. For even the saints from the beginning of the world until the time of Christ have not had private absolution, but have had to take comfort in the common mission and build their faith on it. And even if David had a private absolution from one case, he still had to keep to the common absolution and preaching from other sins, before and after, as did Esaias and others. But now that the gospel is revealed, it proclaims forgiveness of sins in general and in particular. 

It is true that Osiander says: "Conscience does not dispute in general whether God is merciful, but in person whether God will be merciful to me. However, even though the sermon and mission are common sayings, each one should realize that they are universal, and should not exclude himself from them, but should accept them as his own and special word, because God has commanded all 1), 


1) "all" set by us instead of: "alone". 


to believe his promise. And even though few believe in it, he still wants to keep it for all others who rely on it, as St. Paul says Rom. 3, 3: Numquid incredulitas eorum fidem Dei evacuavit? What would follow if there were no forgiveness without private absolution? How could one advise the stupid consciences, who cannot hear the private absolution as often as they are challenged with terror and fear, not only in venial sins, but also in grave high things? How should they also comfort those who are hurried to death in the countryside or elsewhere, since they do not want to have priests in a hurry? Just as this may happen in many places where the gospel is persecuted, so that no priest will give absolution to a true Christian. Thus Christian life and being is such an eternal conflict, in which one seeks forgiveness for and against the horror of sins. 

Secondly, we know nothing else to judge before God, except that the common preaching of the Gospel also has the work of working forgiveness of sins in the heart in those who comfort and raise their frightened consciences with faith; as St. Paul says: "The Gospel is a power of God, by which all who believe in it are saved"; item, 2 Corinth. 3, he calls the gospel a ministry of the Holy Spirit, bringing life and righteousness; item [Rom. 10:17], Fides ex auditu est, auditus per verbum Dei; all of which is spoken primarily of the Ministerio verbi, both in general and in particular. And in sum, since the common gospel is God's word, which we are obliged to believe by God's command and commandment: where the same faith is, there must be forgiveness and blessedness. Thus the gospel itself is a common absolution, for it is a promise that all and everyone in particular are to accept, by God's command and commandment. Therefore, we cannot forbid and condemn common absolution as unchristian, since it serves to remind the hearers that everyone should accept the gospel, that it is an absolution, and that it also belongs to him; as your form is set for such a reminder.

But that it is said that one cannot absolve the multitude, in which there are many who should be bound more cheaply; one should also not absolve anyone who does not desire it 2c.: on this it is to be known that there are two things: preaching and jurisdiction. Jurisdiction belongs to public’ sins; besides these, there are many more secret sins, which cannot be bound and punished in any other way than generally through the ministry of preaching. Thus preaching binds all unbelievers, and at the same time gives forgiveness to all believers. Yes, even the one who was bound by the jurisdiction, if he would come back to obedience and faith through the sermon, would be forgiven before God; although he must then reconcile himself with the church, as he has also offended. Since this absolution is also conditional, itis as otherwise a common sermon; and every absoluteness, both common and private, has the condition of faith; for without faith it does not absolve, and is therefore not a false key. For faith does not build on our worthiness, but is only so much that one accepts absolution and says yes to it. 

This is, in brief, our simple opinion, which we do not ascribe to E. W. for the sake of complaining to anyone or causing greater dissension, but because you desire to know our opinion. For we sincerely wish and desire that God grant grace that your church may remain in peace and unity, and increase in the knowledge of Christ and all good fruits. Therefore, we kindly ask that Your Worshipfulness consider acting in this matter in a friendly manner, as we do not doubt that Your Worshipfulness is inclined to do so itself. And this is our concern, since it is agreed on both sides that the private absolution is Christian and to be preserved, that both parts unanimously encourage the people to such private absolution; and because it is difficult for Mr. Osiandro to practice and keep the common absolution, that he would not be urged to do so, but would leave the other part, which keeps the common absolution, unchallenged for the sake of peace, and on the other hand he would also remain unchallenged by the other part; but that both parts would exhort the people to the private absolution at the same time. 


This, we think, should be a way that would not be burdensome to anyone's conscience and would be conducive to peace. So we also hope that both parties are inclined to peace, as in such matters they seek no other than improvement, and not division and annoyance. Thus, Mr. Osiander has a Christian good concern about binding, which belongs to public sins alone; and what we have considered of such excommunication, and attributed to E. W. before this time, is a matter of peace. W. before this time, which E. W. undoubtedly knows well to remember. May God grant E. W. grace and peace, Amen.

namely, you who, overcome by your conscience, cannot give way to them, 1) are worthy of forgiveness; again, those who claim that they are overcome by their conscience are also worthy of forgiveness - therefore let this forgiveness be granted to one another and bear one another's burdens according to the law of Christ, and in this way put an end to the discord, that you on both sides henceforth keep silent in public about this question, until it is subdued in itself in time. In the meantime, you may keep this opinion within yourself, and, as before, not find yourself weighed down in your church by the use of public absolution; again, those may keep their opinion within themselves, and, as before, use this absolution, until, after the minds have been calmed and the former peace has been established, a determination can be made on this matter without offense to the minds. You cannot order or do anything good when the minds are so agitated, and it can easily happen that you make a beam out of a splinter if you continue to engage in disputes. Perhaps you will all also cause a great disturbance among yourselves, to the delight of Satan and his, which will be very difficult to settle afterwards. For you seem to me, according to your special talent and erudition, to be able to discuss many things excellently, but there are people on both sides who do not do enough for me either. We are human beings and can easily be deceived by our flesh if we do not listen to one another and depart from our senses. You know well enough what the end could be. Therefore, for Christ's sake, since it now seems to us that your quarrel can have no other end nor measure, | beg you to deign to drop this question that has been raised, and that you withdraw from the war against each other, as | have advised above, and that in the meantime, leaving matters unchanged and publicly silent about them, you press on to what you teach together.

| have said that this man is busy with so many thoughts and, as | can see from his writing, is so far from the integrity of our teaching. But, as | have said, if he were more irritated, greater annoyances would be poured out, by which, though he would not win, he would nevertheless cause disturbances and excite quarrels, which had better be prevented. If, therefore, our counsel pleases you, we hope that in time this matter will quiet itself, and that in the meantime he will draw nearer to us. We will lose nothing by this patience and modesty, and he will, if he does not get along again, do more harm afterwards by his obstinacy. This is our opinion. May the Lord Jesus put an end to this and all troubles, amen. In him you are well, my dear brother.

To Johann and Joachim, Princes of Anhalt. 


Luther exhorts the princes to steadfastly hold to the Gospel and gives them rules of conduct for the upcoming presence of several Catholic princes. 


From a copy in the 1587 handwritten chronicle of Anhalt by Bartholomaus Schwanberg in the state archives at Zerbst printed in Kolde, Analecta, p. 194. 

Guade, comfort and peace in Christ. Sublime princes and gracious lords! We hear here, how until Sunday sJ9. October’ the Cardinal, Margrave House, 1) George 2c. are to arrive in Dessau for the day. Nuu 


1) "The Cardinal" is Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz; "Marggraff Hanns" is probably his brother, the Elector Joachim of Brandenburg (see Késtlin, M. Luther [3.”, vol. Il, p. 295); "Georg" is Duke Georg of Saxony. 





We think that they will not let it go, and that they will fight against us with words for the sake of the gospel, and we will also take care of the temptations of us, and therefore we call upon our Lord and Savior with all our heart and faithfulness, and ask that he will strengthen and preserve us in his word and in the work that we have begun, amen. About this we do not know how to fight with such heads, because they neither want to see nor hear. But E. F.

Luther informs him that he has written to the princes of Anhalt about the enemies coming to Dessau, the Catholic princes mentioned in the previous letter. Their deliberations would probably concern the city of Erfurt. Luther exhorts him to confidently despise them and to stand firm against them.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. M. Nicolaus Hausmann, the extremely faithful servant of the Word in Dessau, his brother who is extremely dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have written to your princes, dear man and exceedingly dear brother in the Lord. | hear that those Cyclopes are coming to your town who are hostile to our Gospel and to us. It is easy to sense what they will discuss and do, for Erfurt may be the scene of these movements. May the Lord destroy the plots of the wicked, and may the will of our Father be done, on earth as it is in heaven, amen. By the way, | hope the greater tyrants will not dignify you with either a greeting or a salutation. But to the other two, one of whom is called Julius [Nobody] and the other Nemo [Nobody], you will easily answer with a certain greeting, if they consider you worthy of sight and address. Be a strong man, and if the occasion should arise, answer them with short and serious words, namely, with a mind raised in Christ, bravely despise these Goliaths, because it is written that even these, if they do not desist, will be a footstool for the feet of the Lord. Christ laughs at their rage; we suffer it, but one day we will also laugh. Therefore receive them as water bubbles with a steady mind and a firm eye (if they should want to speak), and think that you are speaking to those whom our Lord Jesus greatly despises, and whom he will bring before us in that day to judge them. Then they will throw away their boasts and great (sesquipedalia == a foot and a half long) words, of which they are now brimming this moment and are puffed up against us, who will be their lords and judges for eternity. May the Lord strengthen you and glorify His name through you, as He began, to the end, Amen. We pray for you against those, and we will pray; doubt not. Christ will keep his word; we are without worry, he cares for us. My Lord Kathe and all our people greet you respectfully. There is no news, except that it is said that the un 


The people of Erfurt do not keep their measure. But such is the rule of the centaurs, who are more concerned about their inclinations than about the advantage of their princes. Let us pray, let us pray. Fare well in Christ. The day before St. Galli [Oct. 15] 1533.

To Mr. Johann Agricola, Christ's servant. 

Grace and peace in Christ! So, my dear Agricola, you will finally have a beautiful opponent. This man Wicel, who, as his appearance, let alone his words and writings, indicate, is entirely composed of lies and empty pretense, and truly lost and despairing of himself, as he has also always been with us, though concealed and pretending everything. You (of this | am convinced) will act the cause of the gospel in such a way that you will think that this viper is not yet born (not merely dead). For what he holds and teaches is all too nothing, quite unworthy that anyone experienced in our doctrine should be troubled for his sake. He will fall by himself if only what is ours is taught clearly and abundantly. For his is such that it can neither be taught nor easily understood, being understood neither by himself nor by his kind. The LORD be with thee and thy vine and thy grapes. Greetings to you and yours, my Lord Kathe. Respectfully greet Doctor Caspar [GUttel] and all of us. 1533, Wednesday after the eleven thousand virgins [October 22].

Grace and peace! We have answered your letter and those of the other two, which are assigned to the visitation in Voigtland and Meissen, which Mr. Erasmus Spiegel 2) brought with him, through the next messenger, who wanted to visit you in Altenburg, and | believe that you have received our letters. Spiegel, before his other business, could not negotiate more extensively with me on this matter the evening he delivered your writings, and early, as he was leaving, we had to meet at D. Martin's in a heavy trade of the Nurembergers, which concerned the Osiander. | hope that you will also like our opinion in both matters.

You will offer my help and service to the mirror in all matters. As for the Mr. Johann Minkwitz [xxxxxxxxx] to Concerning the deal that you are hinting at with those covert and mysterious words, D. Martin and Philippus instructed me to write to you that you should completely play the ignorant and not touch this deal, but Luther will appropriately act differently at this time. The man Minkwitz is great in many respects, and peculiarly useful to our commonwealth, indeed, to the public affairs of all Germany. Not all errors can be corrected at once, nor do we think that this man is to be counted among the great heaps. But this we say in your ear for the sake of many causes: | advise that you, before you do anything, first obtain Luther's advice in very secret letters, and that the letters be sent to me to deliver them into his hand. You write that you now know of a diaconate to which someone with a salary of 60 guilders could be appointed.

first our letters. On last Friday [Oct. 24.] from the tenth hour of the night until the twelfth hour (as Luther himself saw, while many others stood by) there flew in all four parts and regions of heaven, as he himself says, over the whole sky many lousy of fiery torches, not of the color of the stars, but of a flame-like and fiery color; he says that he has seen nothing similar in his life, and thinks that they were not natural impressions, but | do not know what kind of games of the devil in the air, which nevertheless meant something great. Michael Stiefel is held (as it is called) knitted 1) to the prince's hand, but not as a prisoner in jail. He will be deposed or otherwise punished by the parish. Around the garden of old Kreppin, Philip's mother-in-law, not far from this city, a tremendous roar has been heard at night, as of armed horsemen and fighters, and this has been told me by Philip himself, who heard it from his mother-in-law, who heard it from her gardener, who swears that this is not fictitious. Luther, as he is a despiser of the devil and has experienced [his] temptations before, says that these are all games and deceptions of the devil, who is unwilling against the gospel and wants to make us fearful through false terror, because he cannot do it with true weapons, since God protects us. But one must ask for peace and for authority, and not act presumptuously in the affairs of God. Luther now writes a very useful and exceedingly strong ram, 2) by which the papacy will be crushed like an iron wall, if there is still one: "Of the papal consecration, and angle or private mass." 3) There, he says, you will have a council what to do with the abbot at Griinhain. Wicel is laughed at in Eisleben by the sane and godly people, despised by the common people, detested by Count Hoyer himself, and always walks along sadly, perhaps having long since had a conscience about having betrayed the gospel and, as much as there is in him, having killed and condemned it. | will write against him if the matter requires it, and will treat that mouth as it deserves, which is born to bring out the dung that Satan has put in him as his resignation and cloaca.

Joh. P. Weller to Joh. Brismann. 


Detailed report by Weiler, as an eyewitness, on the proclamation of the Last Day by Stiefel in Lochau. 


The original is in the von Wallenrodt Library at K6nigsberg. 

Printed in Actis Boruss. ||, 689 (not correct) and (after the original) in Burkhardt, p. 216 (several times interpungently disturbing the sense). Hail! | recently gave someone a letter that was to be delivered to your noble prince, but | hear that it was lost through the carelessness, or, to put it more correctly, through the rebelliousness (renitentia) of the messenger, in which | wrote, among other things, if | remember correctly, some things about Stiefel's prophecy, which | will repeat in a few words so that you have the story in its entirety. You know how he started the story in a modest way, so that he did not seem to bring up anything improbable or contrary to Scripture. For he said what everyone said at that time and still now, that the end of the world was near. But after he had perceived that this met with the approval of the people, as it is wont to happen with all new things, he brought a prophecy on the way and invented | do not know what kind of revelation, and, not satisfied with that either, began to demand of our Lord Doctor that he should approve his conceits and confirm his prophetic books by prefaces. When the Herr Doctor refused this, Stiefel began to attack him by letters, and asserted in a more than bitter manner that the spirit had gone out in him, calling him a Pilate and Herod. Luther endured this, as he was wont to do, in the most modest manner, and exhorted him in letters, which were kept as friendly as possible, that he should desist from his presumption. For he went so far in his nonsense that he not only predicted the year and the day, but also the hour. When this was reported to the prince, he began, as was right, to become indignant when he saw that new doctrines were being spread near his door. 





and, moreover, considered these meetings suspicious because of a riot. For there ran together an immense crowd, and a mixed one at that. Therefore he would have thrown the boot into prison if Luther had not intervened. Finally, he was forbidden to mention this matter in his sermons. Stiefel certainly promised sacredly, but soon after the departure of the prince he returned to his old ways, because the predestined time was near. But it was the day after Luca [119 October], at the eighth hour in the morning. Therefore, three days before, he began to exhort the people to repentance and to partake of the body and blood of Christ; he did the same on the following day. On the third day he rested, perhaps because by fate it was a Sabbath 1); but he was busy hearing confessions, for an immense crowd had gathered there, even from regions forty miles and more distant. In short, | went there with some members of the school (scholasticis) to refresh my spirit, so that the spectacle would not be without spectators. At the same time, | was admonished by the doctor that | should observe everything carefully. We arrived in the evening, however, so that we would not disturb the story if Stiefel learned that Wittenbergers were there. By chance, | found some in the inn who had traveled all the way from Silesia; | saw that they were sad and thoughtful, fasting and sober. Soon it becomes clear what kind of people they are. | approach, greet them, and since | have nothing else to say, | complain about the rain and blame the carter's obtuseness for not knowing the way. Then | ask who they are, where they come from and what news they bring. Immediately, the one who was the oldest among them began to speak, saying that he had come from Silesia, prompted by the rumor of the last day, of which they had heard that he was at the door; But now he knew that he was there, instructed by Stiefel, whom he placed among the prophets and then exalted with praise to heaven, and said that he was not a little surprised that among our people 2) so little consideration was given to such a great man, while among his people he was honored as what he really was, namely, as a prophet, and he spoke this out.

of experience, do not let yourself be guided by assumptions. Then he asked me to come together with the man, he knew that he could satisfy me and anyone else by his proofs; there was such a great spirit in him that he could do it, such a great kindness that he wanted it. While we were talking like this, | don't know what other people came in between, a not to be despised crowd, there were about twenty; these were followed by others and again by others. And so you could see all the seats full of guests. And to put an end to the story: one goes to bed, and in the place that each one had taken, one could rest, if otherwise there can be any rest in such a big crowd and such a big hubbub. | wake up very early, since it was still quite dark, my companions. Among all, the shepherd of the cattle, as he had been ordered by Boots, was the first to give a sign; |, thinking that it was the last trumpet, admonished those who happened to be around me not to lose heart. But the prophet had foretold that it would happen that first of all the animals would die; so that the cattle and the sheep would not frighten his own, the shepherd, obeying the word, drove them away. Now we stream into the church. We see that everything, at least as much as it could be done in this scantiness, was arranged quite solemnly. The beginning of the mass was: "From deep distress"; the epistle of Paul follows; after this: "Now we ask the Holy Spirit", and after that the priest reads the gospel. Finally the whole crowd sings with each other the apostolic creed: "We believe" 2c. And meanwhile Stiefel mounts the pulpit. After a short preface, he finishes the Gospel with very few words. Then he begins his prophecy with these words: "Everyone among you knows well enough that there is a rumor, which is not dark, that the last day is coming, and they say that | am the author of this rumor. But there will be no one who can say in my presence that he heard this [from me] in holy sermons. 2) "Let no one believe that this has been said of me because | do not know that day which is highly desired by me, since | am not only aware of the day, but also of the day itself. 


1) After In so Burkhardt has a comma; it should be in front. 2) In what now follows, Burkhardt has punctuation that disturbs meaning. 


But because | have been forbidden by certain people not to mention this matter in sermons, | have been forced to obey them, which | certainly command by divine grace. However, | do not deny that | have made many who demanded just this of me certain about that day and even about the hour; | have also indicated this to many by letter. But because this very day has dawned, and also the hour is approaching with its presence, | would be wicked and ungodly if | did not communicate to you my revelation, which has been granted to me by God, and | will, especially in this matter, obey God rather than men. | therefore announce to you that today is the day of our redemption, and so that you also have the hour: it is the eighth hour that is now coming (but it was between the seventh and eighth). It is also not hidden to me that some look at my person, who despise this revelation, and base themselves on it, that it argues against the holy scripture, especially in this saying [Matth. 24, 36.]: "But of the day and the hour no one knows." O dear God! How far such people err from the right knowledge of the Scriptures; this serves clarification for me. For it is written in another place that one should not add to the Scriptures, but also not take away from them. But how much those take from Scripture who take the divinity from Christ, judge for yourselves. But just by saying that no one knows the day and the hour, not even the Son of Man, they certainly take the divinity from Christ. Therefore they do not understand this word: "No one knows the day and the hour. The evangelist speaks in the present time, because one reads: "nobody knows" and not: "nobody will know". Therefore it will happen that everyone knows. Otherwise it would necessarily follow that Christ himself would not know the day and the hour. But that Christ knows this | can easily prove: first, because after his resurrection he said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. But if all power is given to him, it is necessary that he knows everything, otherwise how could he exercise his omnipotence in things which he has not known? Therefore, you see what kind of power those people attribute to Christ. Secondly, there is now no one who is a Christian or wants to be considered a Christian who does not admit that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father. But sitting at the right hand of the Father is nothing else than that he is true God, like the Father. But who is he who denies

wanted that [nothing is] 1) hidden from Him, except who denies the omnipotence. So what is it that these people doubt that it will happen that the day and the hour can be predicted? Besides, | have many other things that | would like to tell you, but | am afraid that | do not have enough time. For the hour is near; moreover, there are not a few who desire to partake of the body and blood of Christ. But to return to the matter at hand, | have said that there will be people who know the day and the hour. First, | give thanks to the Almighty God for His immense and infinite grace and goodness towards all, but especially for this revelation that has been given and granted to me, from which | can truly assume that God does not look at the person. Then you know that from the beginning it has always been the case that when God wanted to bring about something extraordinary, He always sent prophets ahead to predict that this would happen, as can be seen from the example of Noah, who predicted the Flood. Then he cited several other examples of the Old Testament, until Christ, who had John as a forerunner. But that the last day exists is indicated by the clarity of the Gospel. It still remains that we determine the day and the hour, which of course, as you know, no one before me has ever known, but by a certain special grace, as | said before, this alone has been granted to me by God. But so that you may know that | am not led by a false delusion, or missing through error, | will explain my revelation to you. There are two things in the holy scripture: the word and the mathematical number. There is no need for me to say more about the word here, especially since you know enough what it is and have often heard it from me as long as | have been a pastor. The number, however, is the measure of the times, as can be seen from Daniel, Ezekiel and the Revelation. Now, as it is certain that the word is certain, so also the number must agree with it. Moved by this reason, | first subjected all that belongs to the Old Testament to the calculation, and immediately found that everything coincides with the numbers. | did the same in the things that belong to the New Testament; in the end, | also arrived at the last day and even at the hour of

myself, and found that it was the eighth. There remains only one doubt, whether this is the hour in the morning or in the afternoon. But although the calculation wants the afternoon hour, | still believe that it is the morning hour. And this is a consideration that first came to my mind yesterday when a certain godly and pious man, whom | will not name, talked to me about this matter. For as Sunday is the best day in the whole week, and Christ has chosen the same, 2) so he will also without doubt choose the best of the hours. But the morning hours are preferred to those of the afternoon. Therefore it is certain that he will come now. But so that | may also comfort you: You, as Christians, must shake off the delusion that you think that Christ will cause you fear or terror by his coming, but rather believe that he will come [for you] as a brother and friend, only for the wicked as an enemy. But the saying of Peter, which says [2 Pet. 3:10] that at the coming of Christ there will be a very great crashing of heaven, earth, and all the elements, seems to argue with this; but in truth he does not argue against it. For the same says [v. 13.] that he will create a new heaven and a new earth. This | understand thus: Because God is omnipotent, he can also create a new heaven and a new earth in an instant. He will place this celestial sphere next to this old globe (spheram) and then in an instant he will transfer us, who are godly, to it. 3) After we are taken away, only then will the wicked hear that crashing of the old heavens of which Peter speaks. Therefore there is nothing that you should fear. As he spoke this, he lifted his hands toward heaven and at the same time exclaimed tearfully: He will come, he will come, he will come! And immediately, without a word of farewell, he descended from the pulpit. Only then did the crying and weeping women start shouting and screaming. Stiesel turned to them as he approached the altar and addressed them with these words: "Do not be frightened; he comes as your brother and not as your enemy." He then approached the altar. After the sacred act was performed there, each one went home. Now the ninth hour was near. After the ninth hour was heard, those who were commanded by the prince joined the prophet and placed him ina

About your matter, my dear Leonhard, | will not make a legal ruling, but will consult the doctors. In the meantime, you will teach, as we have done, that women should henceforth abstain from such baptism, because he cannot be born again who has not yet been born. Such births must be commanded to God through prayers. Otherwise, it would finally follow that, in order to avoid danger, one must baptize all children in the womb by pouring water over the womb of the pregnant woman, as often as your danger is feared; or as a certain woman did in the time of the plague: when the time of childbirth was approaching, she drank the baptismal water in the opinion that she wanted to avoid the danger. But about your case, since the boy has already grown up, | postpone my judgment until we give you a unanimous answer. Therefore, if the parents have

If they fear the danger of death, you will advise them to be of good cheer. The soul is blessed, and he desires the right baptism (whatever the nature of that earlier baptism may have been), even if he has not received it from us, because he lacks it through no fault of his own; indeed, he has certainly received it through his faith. Only we have to be careful because of the aversion, whether in this case baptism is allowed. Although | could determine this on my own, | do not want to do it on my own for the sake of public reputation.

Therefore 2) he confesses and desires the wisdom of the papists, that trustworthy judge of God and man. Be well in Christ and pray for me. My lady greets you.

To the highly famous men, the doctors of sacred theology, Johann Hess and Ambrosius Moiban, bishops of the church at Breslau, his brothers in Christ. 

Grace and peace in Christ! How can I, dear men, reply to your letter with anything other than what | have previously published in my booklet 1), namely: if the betrothal in this case is such that it is approved by the relatives as well as by the superiors and the prince, and nothing stands in the way but only the father's stubbornness, which he (as | see from the reports) only overcame late, perhaps because someone dissuaded him from this marriage, then it is to be completely despised and decided for the girl. For in such a case one sees that the father is not neglecting the daughter as a father, who otherwise rightly deserves the credit, but as a tyrant, or rather is preventing her happiness, even though he is using the wealth of the other, future bridegroom. For in marriage preference must be given to love, not to wealth (if everything else is equal in respectability), just as the parents of Samson put the glory of their people after the love of their son. "One must not force them to marry, one must let them love each other, but it is nevertheless advisable" because of the constant living together in life, so that afterwards, when annoyances occur, the daughter cannot claim that she was forced. This has always been our opinion. Anno 1533.

To the respectable, highly esteemed Mr. Johann Ruhel, Doctor of both rights, my favorable master and dear godfather. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable, esteemed, dear Lord and Godfather! Magister Philippus does not want to report anything in writing to Herzheimer, and has his reasons. But | think that your Frichtlin and Krautlin of Halle have now pretended, and have carried the tree long enough on both armpits, and will now work hard at his nettle, the pious. Therefore Herzheimer is to be advised, that he should tear out in time and with honor; the devil believes the pokers and priests more, as you have often deceived me with him. God help me, | want to send more people and armor after the angular mass, and enrage the devil completely. The first anger would have been the best, but you have been the one to prevent it. No more than this commanded by God, amen. My Kathe greets you kindly. Greetings to me your flesh and blood. All that | can and know serve Herzheimer, you have me willing and ready. 1534, January 25.

To the highly venerable brother in Christ, Magister 

Leonhard Beier, the faithful and upright bishop 


of the church in Zwickau. 


Grace and peace in Christ! About baptism, which required you to ask me for advice, | have talked with our people, and so we hold: First of all, that you should teach publicly, just as we have done here for a long time, that women should henceforth abstain completely from such baptism, because he cannot be born again who has not yet been born; otherwise there would be no reason why a child should not be baptized in its mother's womb by water, which one pours over the mother when one fears danger before the birth. Mau shall pray, and command GOtte, the, Father of mercies, the child or fruit not yet born, or that shall die in childbirth. This is the first. Second. To this case of yours with the child that was baptized under childbirth, or rather, when he wished to be born, we want to put such a measure, because it is something past, that you baptize the boy anew, not as if his soul had been lost if he had died in the meantime, because he now, grown up, believes 


1) If one compares the letters No. 2018 and No. 2036, there can hardly be any doubt that this letter is not to be dated from January 27, 1539, where the editions put it, but that the time determination given by us is the correct one. In No. 2018 Luther says that he "wants to consult the doctors", here: "| have talked with ours". Then, in both letters: the child in question has now grown up; finally, it seems quite unbelievable that Beier should have asked Luther's advice again in 1539 about a matter that had been completely settled by Luther in the years 1533 and 1534 by two letters. 


preserved him; but because that baptism was not baptism, he must, not be rebaptized, but simply be baptized as if he had not been baptized. However secure he may have been hitherto without baptism, yet now that he can be baptized he must not despise the same. Thirdly. Women also sometimes deceive us by denying that they have baptized the child in danger of death after birth, as if they doubted the baptism given by the midwife or by a woman, and so they deny, either by silence or denial, that they have baptized. Here again you must teach that they should publicly confess whether the child was baptized by them. Then the child should not be baptized again, but brought into the church, and after the Gospel of Marci has been read and the Lord's Prayer has been said, the minister should confirm the baptism by laying hands on the child. For baptism is to be a sacrament, that is, a public sign of confession, therefore it must be received and administered either by the church minister, or by two and three women as witnesses (so that the word "in the mouths of two witnesses" [Matth. 18, 16] may exist). Now if it is bestowed by one alone, or by the mother herself, it is to be considered as nothing. So also, if 2) the women should be silent or deny that it was baptized, then it should simply be baptized, and such women, who afterwards gossip that it was baptized before, should not be believed. 

The same is to be held of foundlings; even if a note attached to them should say: This child is baptized, nevertheless, because this baptism is given to the church without witnesses, not a public sign or sacrament, it is not to be believed, because it cannot be proved. And it is not a rebaptism here or a remedy for the rebaptizers. For these condemn baptism, which was evidently and lawfully given in the church, and this because they

believe that it is a human, not a divine work. But we know and believe that not a man baptizes, but God Himself through the hand of the Church, therefore the action becomes God's own action.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, the extremely faithful and pure servant of the Word in Dessau, his superior. 

Grace and peace in Christ! M. Georg Held has asked in your name, dearest householder, that | should indicate to you what you should preach about baptism, especially since your prince demands this, and the bishop of Mainz with his brother 2c. will be listeners. And although you do not need much help from me in this matter, since you are richer in spirit by the grace of God, at the same time also because M. Georg may have sent to you what | have preached in these days in four sermons about baptism; but the poor must

serve you, so | too will serve you with my work. 

First, | would advise that you speak of our doctrine without controversy and refutation of the opposing doctrine, lest these godless tyrants think you are preaching to provoke them. Therefore, explain baptism in the same way as the papists do not seem to have taught anything else, although they have taught in an exceedingly cold way. However, | do not want you to name them, so that you do not seem to flatter them, but to treat the matter simply as it is. For the boasts of baptism are these: 

That it is a divine water given by the Word of God from His command, not by a mouthful of men; that it is a new covenant of God with all peoples to eternal blessedness; that it is a work of God, not of men, therefore let it not be stained by the sins of those who misuse it. 

That it is one, and cannot be repeated without a blasphemous denial of the first baptism, as if it were not the work of God, which must be received and held in faith, and otherwise is not useful. 

That it should be outwardly adorned with fruits of faith throughout life; that it should be higher than all the vows and works that otherwise are or can be done, even higher than obedience to parents and overlords. 

That it had been honored in the manifestation of the Father by the voice, of the Son by the humanity, of the Holy Spirit by the dove; this manifestation is now included in these words, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." 

| have treated this passage: "This is my dear Son" 2c. in this way: the Son is offered and declared to us by the Father as the Lord over all and as the bishop of souls, in whom everything is pleasing, without whom everything we do is nothing; he alone is the King, because the Son is the heir of all things; he alone is the bishop, because in him everything is pleasing. The rest will be said by M. George. On the Sunday of SIXDAYSIME [8 Feb] Anno 1534.

Grace and peace! What else could | answer you, my dear Leonhard, than what we teach here and do publicly in this case about which you are inquiring? For this has happened to us not only once. We do not allow women to baptize a member that has come out of the womb, or the head that appears in the natural door, but exhort them to recommend in prayer to God this fruit, which is not yet in our hands, but in his, as well as the fruit that is alive in the womb for so many months (like John the Baptist) before birth. We can also baptize the fruit, if we want to avoid the danger, by pouring water on the belly (umbilicum) of the mother, as it were on a cloth in which the baptized child is wrapped! Therefore, thele fruit that is not yet born must be commanded GOtte. For it is nothing that we have learned from Aristotle and afterwards from St. Augustine: The soul is whole in every part, since Augustine also did not make use of this philosophy iu holy things. We must follow the words of God. For he shall be born again who is born, lest we become like those who worshipped St. Emerentiana, the mother of St. Anne, in reverse (retro), and begin to baptize the womb of a bride ora virgin in the hope of future fruit that will be sown in that womb. This | have said in many words. You provide that this child, which was neither born nor baptized, be baptized publicly. It would be different if it had already been born and then baptized. For then it would have been brought to the priest in the church alone.

They are to beware of the greatest hindrance. If they went to other places to hear the gospel or to use the sacrament, you know that we also advised you to do this before, because Christians are obliged to confess on their own journey that you should announce Duke George's mandate to the people, so that the people would not come into the journey without warning, and know that although you do not force them from the gospel, you still cannot protect them against Duke George. This is what you want to show them this time, that you do not pull them away from the gospel, but you have to proclaim the will of the sovereign prince to them, and you want to remind them that they should go to other places, but that they should not leave the gospel, which everyone is obliged to confess on his own way, and that everyone should get advice from reasonable preachers, what he may think to be Christian in all these.

To the worthy man, Magister Georg Spalatin, servant of the Word and now true bishop of the churches in Meissen, his brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | like, my dear Spalatin, what you write that the nuns at Nimpschen? ) want to take off their monastic habit (nonnismum). But nevertheless they may see to it when they seek to leave the convent, which they do (for I, who have received many nuns, even at great expense, have experienced enough what they must suffer outside from their relatives and brothers), so that they do not regret leaving. Then | do not advise them to be full of confidence. Although the prince would pay them a rich gift when they go out, they would not be able to live on it for long if they were uncertain about the place [where they can go] and a permanent provision. Therefore, if they do not know or hope for husbands for themselves, | do not advise them to leave. With regard to the aged, there is no doubt that it is best for them to remain in the monastery. 

As for the punishment of the servants of the Church, | consider that the jurisdiction of the visitators, of each one in his district, is sufficient, unless there is a public offense worthy of death, which must be judged with the sword, as murder, sedition, arson, adultery 2c. The rest may be decided by the visitators

punish them, either by removing them from office or in some other way, as we have done up to now. Furthermore, if it pleases you to make the parishes empty in three years, then hand them over to such a secular jurisdiction, that is, the lambs to the wolves. For the peasants, burghers, nobles have by nature a hatred for the parish priests. And besides, the pastors are obliged to punish them by word, that is, to insult them; now enemies will be their judges. Who will remain, or at what hour will not each one accuse his pastor, since they already plague their pastors enough, both the peasants and the burghers as well as the nobles, so that the latter rather need a shepherd (pastore) than the latter a secular judge.

To the honorable and wise, mayor and council of Leisnig, our special good friends. 

Our kind service before. Honorable and wise, especially good friends! We have received your letter, concerning M. W., your parish priest, and have heard such incorrectness with a heavy heart: 4) therefore we have written to him sharply and harshly, confident that he will recognize himself, and take our admonition to heart, and henceforth send himself rightly into the matter. If not, then we will, upon complaint, perhaps refer the matter to our gracious lord, the churl.

To Nikolaus Hausmann in Dessau. 


About the good disposition of the Anhalt princes for the gospel, which the bishop of Halle tries to counteract. About the church order. 


The original is in Dessau. Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 204. From the Hanische Sammlung at Kiel in Schiitze, vol. Il, p. 310; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 236 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 527. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1417 f. 

To the highly honored man Mr. M. Nicolaus 

Hausmann, the extremely faithful servant of the Lord in Dessau, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Gladly | hear, best man, what you also write, and this good man has told about the very good princes. Christ strengthen and complete his work in them in great and persevering spirit, amen. It is not to be wondered at that the bishop of Halle is so earnestly opposed; he feels that he cannot so easily do without the very good Lord George, who has so faithfully taken care of the affairs of his kingdom, and yet he realizes that he cannot keep him with him if he follows the Gospel and confesses the same. Therefore, he becomes a flattering siren and tempts him to deny Christ, who lives and reigns forever, and instead to obey the lies of a bishop who does not know how to be a man.

moment of his life. | have often said that if there were no pope, this bishop alone would be worthy of the papacy; he is so rich in all papal virtues, which he now also demonstrates publicly; with what luck, only time will tell. Enough of this. 

| was very pleased that you wrote that it was not your intention that the orders should be published. For in this way it will happen that with time the matter itself will order everything better. For such things are better written after the fact than before the fact. For the law says and it does not happen, but history happens and is said or written. 

May the Lord Jesus, who willed that you should be his instrument in that place, fill you with a joyful and cheerful spirit, so that you may bear much fruit for his grace, amen. On Saturday 4) after Judica [March 28] 1534. Yours, Martin Luther.

Intercession for an Anhalt servant because of a piece of land that belonged to the monastery near Weida. 


Handwritten in Cod. Printed by Buddeus, p. 242 and by De Wette, vol. IV, p. 528. German by Walch, vol. XXI, 1257 f. 

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Magister Georg Spalatin, Archbishop of Meissen and the Voigtland, the extremely faithful servant of the Word. 

Grace and peace in Christ! My dear Spalatin, this man from Roden,° ) a servant of the princes of Anhalt, a good man, has asked me to recommend him to you. For him it is about a certain field near Weida, of which it is said that you visitators have leased it as a part of the goods of the nunnery, but the father of this man is said to have brought the very same field into cultivation (excoluisse); therefore he desires that if this happens to others who have not worked it, then he should be much more deprived of it.

neither leased nor otherwise granted. You will hear the matter from him yourself, only you will help him, if you can, for my sake. Then | would like to be at the will of the princes of Anhalt in this matter and in much greater things, who have now accepted the gospel with a strong spirit, while the bishop of Halle and other great princes fight against it in vain, and who confess it fearlessly. Do that which | promise myself of you. Christ be with you. Greet your chain (catenam) with its grapes. 1534. on the Saturday 1) before Palmarum [March 28]. Yours, Martin Luther, D.

To the worthy man, Magister Georg Spalatin, 

servant of the Word and now in truth Bishop of the Churches of Meissen, his brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! This pastor of Crossen has asked me only to remind you, because he has praised me very much for your willingness, except that he may have asked for my letter as a witness, namely that you want to be helpful to him in whatever way you can, so that he is not prevented by the envy of his peasants from building his small dwelling in this village, as you know. For you yourself know the matter best, that the peasants complain in vain that an example is being set. For not all of their pastors will do so in the future; indeed, they will not have pastors, since the shortage of pastors that threatens has begun, but ten villages or towns will perhaps hardly find a pastor, since already large towns and princes do not have such as they would like. 


1) Again, Walch has translated Sabbatho Palmarum by "On Sunday Palmarum".

Greetings from my Lord Kathe and yours with you. She is suffering from a severe fever. We live here under flames, uncertain at every hour when we will burn down. Several villages around us have burned; within the city we have had four fires; the first consumed four houses, the others have been extinguished to some extent. And it is certain that this was done by an enemy, for tinder, matches (/ychni), gunpowder and fuses (fomites) have been found. | am moved by great suspicion that this is happening through the unworthiness of Margrave Joachim, so that | almost believe that this tool of Satan is hastening his end, since his shameful deeds are thus pushing him toward destruction. Christ wants to destroy him soon. Fare well in the Lord. 1534, on the Sunday of Quasimodogeniti [April 12]. Yours, Martin Luther.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, the servant of Christ in Dessau, his extremely dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have, dear friend, admitted this man, as you wrote, to the conversation, as he will report to you fund told him”: if this matter would become of such great importance that you should write for the same, since also many enemies and repugnants weigh me down with conversations, who afterwards speak and do the worst of me. 

It is true of Sebastian's harm that he asked me to admonish you; but because | am sure that he has abundance and you are in want, | have not wanted to indicate anything to you, nor to weigh you down, but also 


1902 


| do not yet want you to be weighed down. | will tell him or write to him that he should be patient with you, since he is so rich, and he will do so, as | confidently believe. 

We are sitting here every hour in danger of arsonists, and the matter is carried out under a different guise (as | would dare to swear for the sake of credibility) by this person, the tool of Satan, Margrave Joachim. God may call him to his doom, or it will become an occasion for war, if (what God forbid) arsonists should be sent to him again. 

We have heard that the bishop of Halle was furious, but that he has not yet straightened everything out. He is the one (unus) comrade who is not unlike the brother. Christ will suddenly come upon these Epicureans. This | ask and desire; let it be done, amen. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me. 1534, Sunday Quasimodogeniti [April 12]. Yours, Martin Luther.

Grace and peace in Christ! Here you have the letter of the most gracious prince, my dear Justus, as a quite reliable witness about the income of the priesthood at Wartburg, which the captain and the castle will assign to you. So you should come (as you write) with heavy money in your right hand, you will be a very pleasant guest for us, of course not for the sake of your money, but because we wish to see and hear you in Christ, especially at this time, which is oppressed by pernicious sects, so that at least we few in this last time will be found in one spirit.

To Balthasar Joppel, weiland? Herzog Georgen zu Sachsen Organist 2c. 


See St. Louis edition, vol. X, 1732. - As we have set the heading, it is found in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, p. 162; in the Jena (1568), vol. VI, p. 166 d and in the Trostschriften, Jena, Rédingers Erben, p. O vij. But in all newer editions, the words: "weiland Herzog Georgen zu Sachsen Organist 2c." have been omitted, since one took offense at the word "weiland" by attaching to it the meaning: deceased, which did not want to fit at all, whether one referred it to Duke Georg (for he died only in 1539) 2) or to Balthasar Jéppel, because one does not write letters to deceased people. In order to avoid this inconsistency, the word "weiland" was simply deleted from Luther's letter of Nov. 10, 1539 "to Johann Mantel, weiland Kirchendiener zu Wittenberg," just as it was from Walch, also from De Wette, in the Erlangen and St. Louis editions, Vol. X, 2006.

Also from this Lindner's and Seidemann's error may appear that (according to the Dessau Archive) Melanchthon sent a letter of consolation d. d. pridie Pentec. and both letters were transmitted to Georg by copy of Hausmann with an accompanying letter d. d. Dessau 4. feria Pentecostes [May 27]. How would all this be possible if we were to accept De Wette's date as correct?" The aforementioned letter of Melanchthon of May 23 is found in Latin in Corp.

Amtmann zu Torgau. 

Grace and peace through Christ. Noble, consecrated, dear Lord and friend! My willing services are ready for you. This witness to my letter, Michel Reiner, who has come to me in Wittenberg, has complained to me of his distress, which is heavy on his neck, and has appealed to you for intercession, which | have not known how to deny him out of Christian compassion, because the poor man cannot provide for his weak wife and small children if he is not helped to his rightful property. Believe that letters and seals would be enough to protect him; he is not asking for anything wrong, and is a good Christian man whom the authorities can and should help. So pray for me and at the same time for the poor man that you will have mercy on him, as | have had mercy on him, and use diligence so that his right will be done for him and his heartache will not fall on your conscience. For the lawyers push the matter too far, and do not see the miserable condition in which the poor people are stuck, who have to seek their right. This is what | wanted to tell you, so that it will not be necessary to file a complaint with H.G.H. about this. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befehlt. Date Wittenberg, Tuesday after Trinity [June 2] 1534.

Mercy and peace! | ask, | beg, | implore you, my dear Frederick, that you let this man, Valten Kérner, 3) be ordered to you, because he has driven me to it by his complaints in his cause, which is of course unknown to me (which you easily believe).

Again, since | know that you are men there who have so far proven yourselves by faithfulness and virtue, | cannot believe that any wrong will knowingly be done by you to anyone. Therefore, as | have begun to ask, so | still ask that if his cause has not yet been heard, you help as much as you can that it may still be investigated. Now, if the matter is out of your hands, and the trade is carried on in the hands of the mighty (Centaurorum), see to it that this is brought to my notice, and | will try what | can with the prince. Daily these doubtful and strange things plague me. | must not let the people go away sad, "and yet they are blind matters" which have either been decided in their place or should have been decided. Farewell, my dear Myconius, and be also in this matter a peaceable and a peaceful one (Fridsamus). The Lord be with you, Amen. June 10, 1534.

To Nicholas von Amsdorf. 


Erasmus had answered Luther's letter to Amsdorf (No. 2037), but this answer had been withheld from Luther. Luther advised to henceforth despise such people as Wicel, Crotus, Hauer and Cochlaus, and to direct all attacks against their head and guarantor, Erasmus. Therefore, Amsdorf may publish his remarks against him. 

From Aurifaber's unprinted collection, p. 205, in Schitze, vol. ll, p. 317 and in De Wette, vol. | V, p. 544 f.

contempt for such people as Wicel, Crotus, Hauer, Cochlaus, so that, just as Eck promoted the pope by defending him, so these people may promote Erasmus by praising him. For he has produced these writers for us by his ambiguous and vain babblings. Therefore the attack must be directed against him who, like a butterfly, has thrown such armies of caterpillars into the garden of the church; "it is," as the Saxons call it, "Schietrupe." Therefore, it pleases me that you put out publicly your remarks against him (as| you write). For it is better that the sciences fall than religion, if the sciences will not serve, but trample Christinn under foot. If we allow this, we will be guilty of the trampling of Christ, and he will (if we will not) raise up others who will be bold, for Christ will reign. Some want to bring Christ and Belial into agreement through wisdom: "Nothing will come of it. Fare well in Christ and pray for me On Sunday after John [June 28] 1534 Your Martin Luther.

G. seriously intervene and see to it that this preacher desists or sets his staff elsewhere; for he is of no use and has crickets in his head that have never been heard or read before, and is a vain mad thing without any foundation in the Holy Scriptures. Some here consider it to be Henr. Neverus, who was a barefooter in Wismar, who lost the five wounds of St. Francis in a disputation in Wittenberg, since they had a chapter of time here. E. F.

In Germany we have Michael Aethiops, 1) Diaconus, with whom we have talked about the Christian doctrine in confidence and heard that he agrees with the creed (symbolo), which the occidental church has, and that he has no other opinion about the Trinity than the occidental church has. Therefore we recommend him, at least as much as we can, to good people. For although the Oriental church has several deviating ceremonies, he also judges that their disparity does not cancel the unity of the church, nor does it conflict with the faith, because the kingdom of Christ is spiritual righteousness.

You, my dear Justus, provide that you justify him by the thing itself, namely by the grace and the gift of the prince. This messenger is reliable and faithful, to whom you can entrust the depositum of which you know. Until now, there has been no messenger to whom this matter could have been safely entrusted. It therefore falls to you to preach the Gospel to the poor as much as you can, even in this piece. It is shameful for me to write more to your faithfulness.

G. want to show him the grace, and give him time and space, to pay off his house in the best way, 2) and to provide for his wife and child fairly. In addition, my diligent, humble request that E. C.

Landgrave Philip of Hesse to Luther. 


The Landgrave asks Luthern, because of the great danger that the sacramental controversy brings with it, to be concerned about a constant unification, especially since the Oberlanders have also made their confession in such a way that there is no longer any reason for discord. Answered in the following number. 


The original concept is in the State Archives in Marburg. Printed by Kolde, p. 200. 


Since the dualism that occurs because of the Sacrament brings great disruption and harm to our Christian faith, and is evidently present, God prevent and forbid that, due to the diligent persistence of the papists, a great bloodshed may arise and develop for the poor people in the Upper Lands: Since the majority of the preachers in the Upper Lands, and Bucerus in particular, have nevertheless directed and placed their confession in such a way that it is now considered and believed unnecessary that there should be further discord or strife because of it, since Christ and one faith will ever be confessed by all parts, therefore our gracious request goes out to you that you take this matter, which is important to everyone, into Christian and faithful consideration, and 





that a constant unification and settlement of the same article may be undertaken and granted in unison; what we then shall and may do in the same, we do not want to incur any diligence, expense or effort, and are graciously disposed toward you. We have also likewise given Bucero and other preachers in the upper country to know our mind in this way. 1) Dat.

Grace and peace of God in Christ. Sublime, high- born Prince! | have received E. F. G.'s writing, in which E. F. G. desires me to put the matters of the Sacrament in Christian and deep concern. F. G. request that | should take the matters of the Sacrament into Christian and deep consideration, so that a constant unity may be established between us and the preachers of other countries. Now, Your Grace knows very well that I, of course, always desire to have unity, because | am annoyed enough (and detrimental to the Kingdom of Christ) by the overpowering defiance of the  papists, so strengthened by such disunity that without it he would have long since become more humble, if only E. F. G. had asked M. Buzek. F. G. could obtain from M. Bucero and his followers whether they would be willing to do and give in this regard or not; after all, | would also like to be found, whatever | want to clear my conscience. Dear God, | hardly come to the things that not | but others have started, and it seems to me that among them, even the preachers from abroad, there are few who also follow Bucero, and perhaps afterwards should cry out against both. Nothing is dear to my heart. 


1) This "become" is obviously too much.

But if it should be fragile and uncertain at the bottom, then the faithfulness is lost. As much as the F. F. G. can help and advise in this, | ask, for God's sake, to continue. If | can do something against the murderers and bloodhounds, the papists, who cannot and will not stop, for they have rejected Christ 1) or are themselves down and out: then there is no lack and shall not be lack of my poor prayer, doing, suffering, speaking and writing. Christ, our Lord, strengthen E. F. G. to do his will in the grace 2) of his church to wrath against the papists, amen, urns. Wittenberg, Saturday after Galli [Oct. 17] MDXXXIV. E. F. G. williger D.

To the honorable and wise gentlemen, mayor and council of Hervord in Westphalia, my favorable lords and friends. 

Gratiam et pacem etc. Honorable, wise, dear sirs! | have often experienced, and have been told by many, how some heated and hasty people among you encourage the friars and sisters among you to grieve, as if they could not be saved because of the state in which they are; yet they have all put away the abomination of the pope, and hold to Christian freedom, even though in the old dress and form, and lead a proper, disciplined life, working with their hands according to the apostle's teachings: that | well wish that such people, as God would give grace, would mary much, for they are not harmful, but useful, because they are attached to the Gospel. In addition, | hear that they should 


1) "For Christum" put by us instead of: "the Christians". 2) "Graces" == to be gracious, to show grace.

They are to be burdened with the public schools' office and care, for they are not endowed by anyone, nor do they receive interest from anyone, as the endowments and monasteries do, and should do so fairly; nor is it right that they should serve from what they have acquired and not given, for that would mean working and giving money. Accordingly, my faithful admonition, E. Wisdom, is that the pious people should not be so distressed, lest, as you are about to do, your city should get the cry, as if it were seeking other people's work and goods, when you might well need the right pens for such a school. | have written before that time itself will find counsel, which, | hear, is interpreted as if one should force them henceforth, but give the words that with time it will be found, namely whether they want to remain so or willingly change.

And | have spoken of those monasteries which are endowed by the treasures of princes and kings, and which idle people make into places of lust with the donated interest. Your monastery is a private house that feeds itself by its own labor, as if a private citizen had his children educated. But those are public institutions and monasteries and cathedral convents founded by common expenses. Of these | speak. Why do they require you to serve from what you have earned? Why do they themselves give nothing of theirs, or do they not use those common goods for this purpose? | write about this matter to your council, and at the same time | ask them to praise our word: "that time itself will find counsel.

Anton Corvinus to Luther. (Regest.) 


Corvinus expresses his joy that Luther's translation of the Bible has been completed and published, and praises it highly. He expresses his gratitude for Luther's honorable preface to his book against Erasmus' tract concerning the sought-after comparison of the religious dispute (St. Louis edition, vol. X VIII, 2006). When he wrote this book, he still held Erasmus' scholarship in high esteem to some extent, but now, after the latter's writing 


1) Krafft has resolved "3. p. Ceciliae" by: "the third day after Caeciliae", Nov. 25, but we think it should be taken 3. fer. p. Caeciliae, Tuesday after Caeciliae, Nov. 24. Even counting according to the Latin way, Krafft should have put Nov. 24.

Grace and peace in Christ and my poor prayer 2c. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | have previously also written to E. C. F. G. on behalf of Martin Sangern of Schneeberg; now, however, good people have come to me on his behalf, who have indicated to me how E. C. F. G. has given a gracious answer to your pastor on Schneeberg, that he should be secure in his body and goods, and otherwise more secure in his possessions and other things, 2c., | have asked E. C. F. G. for one more thing on his behalf, because he has vouched for himself and is graciously assured of his body and goods, E. C. F. G. would mercifully look upon his misery, his wife's and his eight small children's misery, and let them come to him again, so that he does not go astray and become a beggar and have to be without wife and child. The matter is truly difficult for him, and very harmful to his wife and children, as E. C. F. G. himself can tell you. Because he is so far pardoned that he should not be expelled from the principality, except on the Schneeberg; but | do not know, nor do | wish to know, what his guilt and offence is, except that | hear that the tithing officer, Paulus Schmidt, almost wants to harm him: so | once again humbly ask that E. C. F. G. will be kind enough to forgive him. C. F. G. would graciously consider his wife's and child's needs, which are growing for him, and which are in great need of discipline and care, so that they will not be spoiled and neglected 2c., and yet let him come in again to his own, where it is possible without E. C. F. G. complaint or displeasure. For they cause me misery and distress for wives and children, for whom his cause is so heartfelt, and who must know for himself what it is like to be from wife and children, and also from food, and to float in error, and to consume what is his, that | should give them such

Grace and peace in Christ. My good friend! | have truly been sorry for your accident, and still am, God knows that; and it would have been better at first not to take the revenge, because it cannot be taken without burdening the conscience, because it is a self-inflicted revenge, which is forbidden by God, Deut. 32 Romans 12: "Vengeance is mine, says the Lord, | will repay," 2c., and cannot be otherwise; for he who enters into it must put himself in harm's way to do much against God and man, which a Christian conscience cannot approve. 

And it is true, that your harm and infamia shall hurt you justly, and you owe to save and preserve the same, but not with sins or wrong. Quod justum est, juste persequeris, says Moses; injustice is not made right by other injustice. Now being a self-judge and self-judging is certainly unjust, and God's wrath does not leave it unpunished. What you may do rightly, you do well; but if you cannot do rightly, there is no other counsel but to suffer injustice. And God, who thus lets you suffer injustice, has good cause for you. He does not mean any harm or evil to you; he can also repay you honestly in another, and so you are safe.

And what would you do, if he wanted to punish differently, to wife, child, body and life? If you want to be a Christian, you must still say: My dear Lord God, | deserve it, you are just, and do only too little according to my sins. And what is the suffering of us all compared to the suffering of His Son, our Lord Christ? 

Therefore, if you desire my counsel (as you write), | advise you to accept peace where it can come to you, and rather suffer damage to your property and honor, than that you should go further into such undertakings, in which you must take upon yourselves all their sins and evil, which would serve you to feud; 1) they are not pious, and mean you with no loyalty, seeking their benefit. At last they will betray you themselves, so you have fished well. If you do not paint the devil over the door and do not ask him for help, he will come anyway, because such companions are the devil's companions, and they usually come to an end according to their works. 

But you must understand how hard your conscience will bear it if you Knowingly destroy so many people when you have no right to do so. If you are content to honor God, and let God inflict your harm on you, and for his sake, 2) you will see that he will bless you again, and reward your work abundantly, so that your patience, which you have borne, will be dear to you. To this end may Christ our Lord, teacher and example of all patience and helper in trouble, help you, amen. Tuesday after Nicolai [8 December] Anno 1534.

To the illustrious, well-born Prince and Lord, Lord John, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien, Lord of Bernburg, my gracious Lord. 

God and peace in Christ. Sublime Prince, gracious Lord! Magister Franciscus has reported to me some articles of the Anabaptists that have crept into Zerbst, and E. F. G. has asked how they are to be dealt with. F. G. Begehrd besides, how to be done with them 2c. But there must not be much dispute, because they are such sneaks and come secretly without being called, like wolves in the sheepfold. On the other hand, their articles are publicly inflammatory, murderous and blasphemous, also approving of the damned coiner. Therefore, E. F. G. cannot do otherwise than to do so seriously and not tolerate them in any way. How they should be examined, however, is beyond my authority, because it is a secular matter. Nevertheless, it would be good that they were also sharply spoken to spiritually, whether their insolent consciences want to be ashamed, namely, who sent them here, and who ordered them to sneak in this way, because they should know where their spirit is right, that no one should send himself nor call himself, just as Christ himself did in Heb. 5. did not honor himself 2c.; wherefrom they have the right to interfere with a called pastor in his office, and behind his knowledge turn away his commanded people, so that they may condemn his doctrine in an insidious and unheard-of manner, and are not so honest that they would have greeted him or his overlords for it beforehand. Such are vile knaves and, as Christ says John X, thieves and husks or murderers, and that one reproaches them harshly with such things, as they have deserved death with it alone, and what else is worthy of their seditious doctrine 2c., as E. F. G. well knows to do better in this than | can write. | thank my Lord Christ that he has heard our prayer and made the dear prince, Prince Joachim, healthy and happy, He give long, amen. May the same Christ be with E. F. G. and both my gn. Lords with all that is and is called, Amen. Tuesday after St. Lucy's [Dec. 15] 1534. E. F. G. williger

The above regest in Kolde, Analecta, p. 201, with the note: "Krafft rightly notes that afterwards the objection printed in De Wette, IV, 570 (the preceding number) comes from Melanchthon." We are of the opposite opinion, and hold that this misgiving bears in a pronounced way the nature of Luther. Would Melanchthon ever have dared to say "that the body of Christ is gnawed with the teeth"? The concern mentioned in our letter might be the one found in Corp. Ref. Vol. Il, 800, which Bretschneider says Melanchthon wrote before his trip to Cassel. Bretschneider places the time of Melanchthon's departure "approximately on December 12" (Corp.

However, | am persuading you with regard to Bruno, and if my requests are of any use to you, | would like you to sell it to him for four hundred and forty guilders, for | hear that it is so valued by your relatives. What do you want to do with this good brother of ours more harshly? since the Lord has just blessed you with this property, and you should not grant anyone anything cheaper, whatever you may have decided to sell. And the Lord is able to bestow upon thee a richer blessing, if thou believest that he was, is, and will be thy Creator, Sustainer, and Multiplier, even after the flesh, for the sake of a special thing, that is, why thou dost in vain dissipate thyself with the care of how the children shall be provided for. Christ, who began it, though he is weak, will accomplish it for those who persevere. | should indeed care for my own, since | am poorer in possessions than you, but | see that the care is in vain. Therefore | command him who has given everything enough until this day, that he will give, if | will be worthy of it in the future, or will take away those to whom he does not want to give.

Doctor Gregorius Brick to Luther. 


Duke John, son of Duke George of Saxony, had complained to the Elector on Dec. 15 about a sermon Luther had preached on All Saints' Day, in which he was supposed to have urged prayers against Duke George and the Archbishop of Mainz, "the bloodhounds. 


1) Already De Wette remarks: "The whole sentence seems faulty." It reads in De Wette: nihil magis egere sequitur, et nihil minus impedietur. We have assumed: nihil magis [quam] egere sequitur, et nihil minus [id] impedire, The ieacing impedire (instead of impedietur) is found in Cod.

1940 


Although the Elector answered evasively on Dec. 20 and reprimanded the Duke to rest, he nevertheless called upon Luther by this letter to justify himself and to give a detailed report on the sermon, and also exhorted him to moderation in his public reply.

My willing service before, venerable and highly honored dear Lord and Godfather! Although my most gracious lord indicates to you in his churf. graces letter that you would find the content and sound of the words from an enclosed list, his churf. graces have ordered me to send your honor a copy of their cousin, Duke Johansen, letter, which you will find enclosed and will hear the content according to the length. 

And since His Lordships suspect that the Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg and Duke Jérg of Saxony will send their message within ten days to His Lordships for the sake of these matters and will make vigorous inquiries with His Lordships, 1) it is His Lordships' gracious request that you answer His Lordships again at this messenger, and that you actually report to His Lordships what the words were and whether you thought of Duke Jérg next to the bishop or not. and report what the words were, and whether or not you thought of Duke Jérgen in addition to the bishop, also what caused you to do so, and to strengthen and emphasize the causes according to the holy Scriptures in such a way that it is proper for you before God to also report it for the sake of your conscience, and thus to petition against them in the Christian community, and that you may not be taken in by them for any defamatory or criminal act. For if they can overcome your honor, they will not refrain from asking for punishment, and if Duke Jérg touches them in such a way, as his son writes, he will pretend that he has acted against the next Grimm treaty 2) and especially against the article of the enclosed law, of which your honor was informed soon after the treaty was made.

Jérgen theologians, scribes and preachers in their writings and sermons, sider the aforementioned 4) Grimm treaty have not forgotten so completely. Therefore, his lordship would like you to instruct the provost, my godfather, Doctor Jonassen and others, whom you consider convenient, to read through the Philippices and other writings of the Duke-J6rg, which have gone out in the past year, with diligence and to investigate whether they are of interest to his lordship or to others of his lordship. G. or other of his churf. G. relatives, as well as you, have been touched therein by name and with what words this has been done, and whoever is found or found out about it, has to inform his churf. G. about it, so that one would have all the more reason to reject the people at first. 

Thus, His Lordship also considers several reports, which His Lordship has otherwise noted, to be good and especially graciously requests that you have good regard for yourselves and take care so that people are not secretly entrusted to you, 5) who would prove a disgrace to you and cause you harm. | also do not want to let your honor's friendly opinion go unreported. For | am always quite willing to serve them in a friendly manner. Date Weimar, Monday St. Thomas the Apostle [21 Dec.] 1534.

Note. My most gracious lord also graciously requests that you do the reports differently than, for the bishop's sake alone, by a special list, because whether your reverence is a little overbearing to the priest in the report, that is not the issue, and for Duke Jérgen's sake also alone. Whether you went a little quietly in the report for that reason, my most gracious lord would like to see, but omnino citra offensionem gloriae et verbi Dei. Date uts.

Grace and peace in Christ 2c. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | have received E. C. F. G.'s writing together with the writings of H. Hansen in Saxony 2c. and have read it humbly, to which | am sending E. C. F. G. the enclosed note, my reply. | also thank E. C. F., G. for graciously providing me with my 2c. | also hope that Jesus Christ will instruct E. C. F. G. not to go too far with promises against S. Georgen; for he is, as S. Friedrich says: "My cousin is a coarse man who does not allow him to be satisfied with any answer, and with such heads the first anger is always the best; they do not desist.

Submitted Public Response. 


Sublime, highborn Prince, most gracious Lord! E. C. F. G. are, according to God's grace and peace, my poor prayer and owed service humbly before. | have received E. C. F. G.'s letter with an enclosed copy of a letter from Duke Hansen of Saxony 2c. and in it | have almost heard how the aforementioned prince is suing me against E. C. F. G., as if | had spoken against his F. G.'s father, H. George, and the Bishop of Mainz with the words mentioned in the letter, as the copy reports at length. E. C. F. G. then asked me to report all this and for what reasons | did so 2c. 

Where should | go, most gracious sir? | would have liked it if the aforementioned prince himself had addressed or written to me about such a speech to a lesser person than the Elector. | do not like to see E. C. F. G. serve in such matters; for it does not have to weigh on me a little that such high princes should make me a poor man against my country prince, to whom | have sworn and serve, out of

such flying speeches without seal and letters, in addition without witnesses, so roughly and clumsily are to indicate, in addition still sue. But it may be that George and his family have to have five zipples on their sack. 

Accordingly, my humble request is that E. C. F. G. would graciously spare me and not request a report from me in such a matter, not for my sake, but for the sake of H. Georgen; for | would like to answer such a rough, clumsy writing to H. Hans too roughly. But shall | do it and tell E. C. F. G., then | will do it honestly and faithfully and give a right answer to such a writing. E. C. F. G. know what unwashed, coarse pieces we all had to digest, especially before the Grimmish Day, which went out under S. George's name and coat of arms. | have forgiven them, but not forgotten them, and | truly do not want H. George to tear open the old wounds. 

I think that E. C. F. G. could not do anything better than to issue an order that one should preach and shout in H. Georgen Landen and confidently print books in Leipzig to disgrace the Elector of Saxony, and forbid that one should not protest in the Electorate; this would please E. C. F. G. not only the enemies, but also perhaps officials and nobles who live from E. C. F. G.'s property. 

But, most gracious lord and prince, this is the summa, S. Hans, S. Georg, bishop of Mainz, | cannot suffer doctors to teach me how | should speak, for | know that they cannot. But if they are so excellent and so exceedingly learned, then | sit here in Wittenberg and will wait for their art, and E. C. F. G. be strict and harsh against me. | will suffer my right, where | do not answer for myself. This much | will give to E. C. F. G. this time for a humble report. | will report to the Bishop of Hall myself in public writing (if God allows me to live), even if | should not earn absolution. For Christ will not be so easily frightened as the holy creature Sanctiss. Leonis lets himself think.

Certainly, | have preached publicly against the bishop and asked that the same sermon go out to the market. Whether | have named St. George, | truly do not know; for since the Grimmish Day, | have put him out of my mind and have not accepted anything from him. But it must be that after the sermon before the Duchess of Brunswick 2) over the table at the Margravine's, | spoke much of the bishop of such words, that he was of the devil, and | wanted to pray against him, perhaps against H. George as well. But if | have not said anything about St. George, | still say it now, and now | want to do and say it more than before. Let me see if | can defend it with my neck. But in a moment

Our greeting before. Venerable, dear devotee! When you gave us an answer to the letter sent to us by our dear cousin, Duke John of Saxony, son of our cousin, Duke George, we do not want to reproach you in your gracious opinion, although our lord uncle and brother, the Bishop of Mainz, and our cousin, Duke George, had their advisors and ambassadors with us, they did not report anything about the matters of which our cousin H. John wrote to us. Only von Carlwitz, who is now one of our cousin Duke George's secret advisors, has thought of the same things against us and reported them for himself: although our cousin would have been somewhat impatient when the report was made to his dear one, it would have been talked out of S. L.'s mind again. But the said Carlwitz has asked that we be graciously in favor of it. Since we have not yet learned that you thought of our cousin by name in the same sermon on All Saints' Day, as the young Margrave stated, 4) our gracious request is to you, if you may do it without burdening your conscience, that you spare our cousin as much as possible, so that we may maintain peace with S. L. externally, and his love may not have to attack us on the Grimmish Treaty. 

But what you may not refrain from doing in conscience or for your own salvation against S. L. theologians, we do not want to give you any measure of that.

Grace and peace! We see from your letter to Jonas, my best Spalatin, that you and your fellow bishops are being asked for the transfer of the pastor and the church servants at Torgau, namely for the reason that their voices were not quite audible in the sermons. Certainly they have also sung the same little song to us, especially after they have heard M. Wolfgang FuB 2) (Fues) in the recitation (voce) of his sermons. But see to it, my dear Spalatin, that you do not let yourself be misled by this few recommendations of the voice.

You will be persuaded to make this dangerous change, which will not only be full of the most serious annoyances, but will also be extremely offensive to us. For if this right is granted to the common people, that they can change their pastors when they are tired of them, how lukewarm will we finally still have pastors? Set yourself as an example: could you bear it if they wanted to either transfer you or make a change with you, either for the sake of the vote or for the sake of health, by adding the Colditzer as an assistant? There are so many virtues in Gabriel 3) and the church servants at Torgau that they should not only obscure the voice of M. Wolfgang, but also denounce his virtues. Therefore, | ask you to spare even ours in this matter, which we cannot see without the greatest offense. Also, such people as these Torgauers are cannot be found so often, and it would be shameful for us to exchange the best for the worst only for the sake of inequality of voice, since even those can be understood sufficiently, teach and read faithfully, and these are useful only by shouting for the itching ears of the mob, but according to the matter itself either to a few or to themselves.

Without date 1534. Concerns why loneliness to flee. 


There are three different redactions of this concern, one Latin and two German, which Seidemann has excluded from De Wette, vol. VI, p. 155 ff. In terms of content, they coincide completely, and, as Férstemann, Tischreden, vol. Ill, p. 167, note, correctly remarks, both German redactions seem to have a common Latin text. - The Latin text is found in Manlii epistolarum D. Philippi Melanchtonis Farrago etc pag. 485 sq. and from it in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 155. - The one German text is found in the Trostschriften, Jena, Rédingers Erben, BI. Giiij® ; in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XIl, BI. 166; in the Jena (1568), vol. VI, p. 274; in the Altenburg, vol. VI, p. 336; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, p. 376; in Walch, vol.

Also in Stangwald, p. 341. -The second German text, probably Aurifaber's translation, is found in all other editions of the Tischreden, Cap. 26, Z 82 (with the exception of St. Louis, where reference is made to vol. XXI). We give here a new translation of the Latin, and leave the two other German redactions as superfluous. 


Exhortation to flee loneliness. D. M. L. 


More and more serious sins are committed in solitude than in the company of people. Eve in Paradise was deceived by the serpent because she was lonely. Murder, robbery and theft are committed in solitude; there Satan is given space and opportunity. Then, too, one is ashamed to commit an outrage among many people or in the company of people. Christ promised that where two or three were gathered in his name, he would be in their midst. The devil tempted Christ in solitude. David fell into murder and adultery at the time when he was alone and idle. And | have learned that | have never fallen into sin more often than when | lived alone. God created man for companionship, not for solitude [as can be seen in the two sexes] 1) of rational beings and unreasonable animals. But man was created in such a way that there should be two of them at the same time, a male and a female, from whose 


1) Here something is missing in the Latin redaction, which we have added after the first German one. 


Before God gathers an eternal church. And Almighty God has ordained, not for the sake of solitude, but for the sake of the gatherings of people, the sacraments and the holy sermons in the Church, from which lasting consolation is drawn. But loneliness, on the other hand, produces the most evil sadness, and whatever may come to our mind, we consider everything evil extremely carefully. And if there is anything unpleasant in our affairs, we make it extremely great for ourselves, and, as if no one were more unhappy, we invent for ourselves the worst outcome of all things. In short, we deduce one thing from another and interpret all this in the worst way. On the other hand, we imagine that others are exceedingly happy, and we torment ourselves very much that they are doing well, but we are doing badly.

I, in turn, would not like to be different from you, wherever | can. We sing over tables as best we can here, and then pass it on. If we make a few sows of it, then it is certainly not your fault, but our art, which is still very small, if we already sing over it two or three times. But Virgilius sings, we are not all equal. And if all composers do it well, our seriousness is still far above that, and we can sing badly enough. And all the regiments of the whole world follow us: they also let God and all reason compose and set very good things, but they also sing that they would be worth a market of sausages from the sows, or clappers in the field bells. That's why you composers have to hold it against us whether we make sausages in your songs. For we would rather hit it than miss it. 

My dear Katha asks that you accept this joke as good and sends you her kindest regards. Hereby commanded by God. 1535, the Priscae [Jan. 18].

Joke about the doctorate of Cario to Doctor of Astronomy and Medicin by Georg Sabinus. 


In Innocent News 1729, p. 877, from Schlicht. Horis subsecivis, P. Il, p. 133; then in Strobel-Ranner, p. 244 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 598. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1267.

| can show the good man, of whom you wrote, nothing else than that | showed him my favor and greeted the one who greeted me again, so at the same time that Count Palatine 1) Georg Sabinus was there, who will perhaps also write to you. | certainly do not only wish you happiness that you are glorified by the doctorate, but also that Count Palatine himself that he has graduated such a great and tall and exalted doctor. Believe me, he will henceforth make few doctors of such greatness and sublimity. 2) Charon himself will be surprised (when he sees you coming to his shore one day) and will fear that the greatness of such a great doctor will either break or sink his so frail and shadowy barge (umbratilis). Or surely you will be forced to pay a large ferry fare for the size of such a large doctor. Therefore, you may see to it that the one who made you such a great doctor also obtains such a great salary for you, and, if God wills it, such a great one (but entirely in gold), because you are such a great doctor. Then you will also be quite safe from that Charon, who, by the way, is exceedingly greedy, since you have that with which you can even richly reward him, let alone pay the ferry fare. This | wanted to joke with you, because you also seemed to joke with me in your letter. Commend me to your noble younger prince, for | do not know what kind of wind is blowing for me with his father 3). Fare well in the Lord, my dear Charon, and pray for me. 1535, Tuesday after Misericordia [April 13]. Martin Luther, D. 


1) In the early fifties, the writer heard this on the occasion of a public act at the University of Rostock in a speech of the Dean of the Faculty of Law, "that as long as he administers this office (of a Dean), he has the dignity of a Count Palatine". The same will have been the case at other universities and faculties, and Sabinus may also have boasted of this dignity. - Georg Sabinus became Melanchthon's son-in-law in 1536.

To Benedict (Gitbe? Baworinsky?), Archipresbyter of the Bohemian Brethren. 4) 


Luther testifies that the presentation of the envoys of the Bohemian brethren showed him sufficiently that they agree in doctrine, and that now, in Christian love, they also want to overlook each other's shortcomings. 


4) With this letter we encounter a threefold difficulty, namely 1. because of the date, 2. because of the name of the addressee, 3. because of the text itself. The question of the date is most easily settled. Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 41, has incorrectly resolved the date offered in his original: Dominica tertia Paschae by "March 30" (Easter Tuesday), while it designates the third Sunday after Easter, Jubilate, April 18. April, as resolved by Késtlin, M. Luther (3rd), vol. Il, p. 668 ad p. 368; and Burkhardt, p. 231, has been on the way to it, but has put the date of the second Sunday after Easter, April 11. Aurifaber offers: Dominica Jubilate, which is correct, whether this is the original reading, or the above date resolved by him. - It is more difficult to determine the addressee. De Wette has (probably according to Aurifaber or to Cod. Helmst. 107 in Wolfenbittel): "To Benedict Gibe." Burkhardt brings p. 231 a twofold regest, one according to Seidemann "An [Benedict.] den Archipresbyter der mahrischen Bruder," the other according to Gindelh, Fontes rerum Austriac. XIX, pag. 18: "addressed to Benedict Baworinsky." Johann Lasicki, de origine etc. fratr. Bohem, lib. V, Z63, has this letter under the superscription: Epistola Lutheri ad Seniores fratrum, and Melanchthon, who no doubt wrote the same thing as Luther to the same addressee about the same time, has the inscription: D. Benedicdto ceterisque fratribus Valdensibus in Bohemia (Corp. Ref., vol. Il, 854. Bretschneider datirt zu friih: I'sdr.). Neither does K6stlin i. e. We can do this, and must be content with the fact that this letter is addressed to an outstanding elder, Benedict, together with his fellow elders. - Two redactions of the text are available, one in Seidemann |. c. according to Johann Lasicki's handwritten Briidergeschichte, which is in the possession of the Briidergemeinde at Herrnhut, the other (according to Aurifaber) in De Wette, Vol. IV, p. 599. According to the content, both are completely the same, according to the wording, they are often different. It must be assumed that one of the two is a retranslation into Latin from a foreign language, either Bohemian or German. We stick to the text given by De Wette and give here its translation.

Grace and peace in Christ. Most esteemed man, Mr. Benedict! We, M. Philip and I, have listened very carefully to these two brothers sent by you. And they will again report our opinion to you, for it has pleased us exceedingly that they have set forth the right way in the faith of the Sacrament, and have interpreted the words which have moved me several times in such a way that | confess | have been satisfied, and that | see no discord in the matter itself or in the opinion, although we use other words. For (as it is said) it is in vain to dispute about the name where the matter itself is agreed upon. We were very pleased that the baptism of little children was also put right with you. For if these two sacraments are properly maintained, everything can easily be put in order, as the brothers themselves will tell us more widely. Therefore you have no reason to doubt, as long as you are of the same mind with us, and we with you, that we will act in sincere love toward you all; even if there should be some deficiency in one or the other part (as we are not all perfect saints in this life), we will bear with each other in Christian patience. It is superfluous enough for the holy Catholic Church 1) to be unanimous in faith and doctrine; necessity compels that the customs and usages be different. For this is how the apostles teach and write, and this is how Christ himself commands the brethren to be forgiven, if only they are and remain in Christ, and indeed we insist most strongly on the distinction of doctrine and life. Doctrine makes either Christians or heretics, life makes either saints or heretics.

Again, | send this matter, which is included in this letter, back to you as to the visitator in these places. For if you find that the girl has been deceived with the marriage proposal, then it seems to me that the first engagement is void.

Nuremberg. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Your letter was not so sad, my best Wenceslaus, as you might have thought, especially because | still noticed that Christ has not yet abandoned you, even though he allows you to be tempted. | am sorry that this tragedy is beginning again among you, but if both of you would consider that these things are not done by you, but by false tongues, that is, by Satan himself, then you could easily endure (devorare) and overcome these evils, even to Satan's chagrin. Perhaps we also do not knock enough on Christ's door with prayers, and this our laziness is thus punished. He does not sleep when we snore. You wouldn't believe how much pride and treachery of the nobles and peasants we have to endure and suffer, so that | am firmly convinced that you, if you were here, could bear the intrigues of our people less than you could bear the impetuous nature of a few people there. | think, yes, | am sure, that the papacy is the kingdom of the devil, which is sent into the world by the wrath of God. But no kingdom has been more suitable for the world. "The world wants to have the devil for a god." | now see the causes why GOD allowed this abomination to rise and exalt itself above all that is GOD: "the world wants it so." And once the bishops were anxious to 2) suppress tyranny, but with all too frightening counsel.

strikes. For since they wanted to force the tyrants, they at the same time suppressed the Church of God. Now the tyranny has begun again, and if God would allow it, spirits would arise again who would bind the tyrants with the same chains as the popes did. But | will not be in the council of such people, but will be a participant of those who fear and tolerate God, and will rather be punished with death than that | should seek such a kingdom, for our kingdom is in heaven (sursum). | write this to indicate to you my heart, which is like your heart, namely, that you may not leave this church. Remember the word of Paul in the superscription to Titus [Cap. 1, 1.]: "According to the faith of God's elect," and again Matth. 24, 22.?]: "All things for the elect's sake." These, | ask, look upon and despise all other people. You are a servant of God's elect, and a spectacle of those whom God has rejected. What is it to us, where the rejected go, if we can serve only the elect and the least brothers of Christ? Therefore, my dear Wenceslaus, carry as much as you can to the end. And although nowadays there is no one | would rather have with me, not only for the sake of the old brotherhood, but also because | have always had you as a comforter and as a man full of confidence, and would prefer to see you with me at my death, | would rather put my profit behind than see the harm of that church. Who knows what fruit God wants to bring forth from this challenge? He makes everything out of that which is not seen, out of nothing, out of opposite things, out of that which deprives us, out of that which is against us: "He is unbound"; let us only pray, and send ourselves to patience. 

You want my verdict that the prince has negotiated with you to return to us. How? if | were to join you myself or go into exile? The prince is very good, because of him | have no doubts. But apart from the prince, there is no one (that | Know of) who would not be suspicious to us (I am talking about the commanders), and you can

From this, measure how great the love and zeal for the Word is in the world. In the meantime, | pray that you will pray this Psalm [Ps. 40], "| wait for the Lord." "Alas! it will not be otherwise than" through honor and dishonor (2 Cor. 6, 8.], through aversions and errors, through good and evil things, through, "and but[mals]" through, devils and angels, through good and evil to the One who alone is good and without evil. Therefore | beseech thee, my dear brother, hear no man, but let the sole conversation be between him and thee. Though others may be very good men, yet it may happen that they have less patience than strict justice. For we are all men, and the flesh lusteth against the Spirit. Further, if the matter should come to the point that he should either publicly spite your person or pant through it, then it will be time for another remedy. "Oh help us God, how very strong God lets the devil be, and makes us so very weak!" Take this in the best way, and remember that we may be tempted by God, then that trusting in man (even if it were a prince) is not godly; and again that fearing man is a disgrace for a Christian, not to say godless.

To Erhard Schnepf, servant of Christ in Stuttgart. 

Grace and peace in Christ! My Theobald, 1) who is pastor of a certain church with us, my best Erhard, comes to you, not out of sacrilegiousness or inconsideration, in order to change the place, but because he is induced by a certain pastor Jakob, who is neighboring you, by the better prospect that he could be provided with some preaching ministry there, especially in a village. It is a matter that concerns life and limb, because it seems that our swampy and very northern air does not want to suffer the Austrian body here, which is accustomed to the mild southern and purer air. Otherwise, if the health of the body did not drive it to it, it could remain here in the quite tolerable position (as it admits itself), which it has at present. | therefore commend to you a very sincere and reliable man, a true Nathanael, a very righteous Israelite without falsehood, and do not doubt that what you show to this one you have shown to Christ. For of me | say nothing; | wish that he may be advised as | am.

Hail in the Lord. Learned doctor and most beloved father in Christ! Magister Leonhardus Beier, our pastor, has shown me your letter in which you still consider me an exile. My mind is most astonished when | read it, because | thought that | had long since been reconciled with your venerability, both because of my repentance, which became known to you from my letter two years ago, and because of the request of some friends and wives. If things stand as your letters indicate, | ask you through Christ that you lift the ban and relieve it until public business permits you to visit your honor, which | hope will happen shortly. In the meantime, so that | may be of a calm mind, | beg most earnestly that you comfort me by one word or another. For | cannot bear that your honor should be disturbed in the least, let alone that it should be angry with me or think anything evil of me. For | am not what most of your honorable people say | am. God and my conscience are my witnesses. Bernhardus Ziegler is very ill with gout.

To his extremely dear brother Justus Menius, the very faithful and diligent pastor at Eisenach. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | am very sorry, my dear Justus, for that old man Thomas, and much more surprised at your compassionate speeches (misericordias) with which you have filled your letter, and yet you have dismissed him with the consent of all of you. | did not want to investigate nor inquire the cause; | hardly endured without difficulty, since he told some trivial things, and easily tolerated that other things were blamed on slanderers and detractors. Here is now by all means no place empty. Therefore | am sending him to his children for a little while, but | wanted something to be paid into his hand, either from the church treasury or from somewhere else among you, so that he would not be pushed out so bare and meager. For you can easily imagine what would happen if we were to take in from the provinces all the outcasts in this exceedingly meager city (since we ourselves are hardly fed here, and on the other hand those of us who are burdened should be pushed out to you). Pray, therefore, that you may provide for your own, and that you may not be relieved of your burdens with which you burden us. If something can be done by me, | will gladly do it, but you and the captain Eberhard 1) see to it in the meantime that Thomas is not endangered by hunger, who has suffered enough through that disgrace. You have there, if nothing else, Draco's legacy with which he can be fed. 

| believe that the office of visitation is burdensome for you, but you, in turn, believe me that the business of all visitations is burdensome as well, so that at times | would like to wish with great impatience that all the evil in our churches become papists. We have to suffer so many aversions, and there is not the ability to stop all evil. Now | have learned what this old saying means: The government of souls is an art above all arts; indeed, a worry above all worries, and a complaint above all complaints.

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, prudent, dear gentlemen and good friends! He Hieronymus Weller has told me what friendship and honor have befallen him with you, which | have heartily granted the good pious man, and have gladly heard, especially because he is your city child, and his honor is your honor. | also hope, as | have certainly reported, that you will show your favor and love for him, for he is a faithful, pious, quiet and learned man, and we are also working on him, and have brought it so far that he should now continue and become a doctor of theology, since we want to do and help freshly and faithfully; For it is evident that there is a lack of people to promote it, and yet things are done in such a way that one must have people, especially those who are to stand at the forefront and fight against the spirits of the mob, and are found wanting among all the ranks who consider such matters and infirmities or help to educate or keep people. And now is a golden time, in which one can well and abundantly, also easily educate learned and fine people; who knows how it will go afterwards. It says [2 Cor. 6, 2]: Tempore placito exaudivi te, et in die salutis adjuvi te. Therefore do well that you take it upon yourselves to help such people, in order to preserve the wretched poor gospel.

Grace and peace! There is no need for you to come here to me, my dear Johann, | have told everything here verbally to the one you have chosen, to Lord Spalatin. He will tell you everything, namely that since your deed and the rumor about it are still so new, it cannot happen that you are again publicly appointed somewhere. Otherwise, we will already be overburdened by external as well as by internal ailments. Therefore, you must be careful to have patience for a while, and to be enough for the ears that are publicly offended by your repentance, until, after your misery has become known, we are free to show and increase mercy. For there are enough quite godless laureates who also make beams out of our splinters: how much more would they load us all with this beam of yours if you were again so suddenly exalted in another place. Humble yourself, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, until the opportunity comes to exalt you again, and you should do this also for our sake, who are forced to bear very heavy things, so that you must have mercy on us with justification, who also innocently suffer so many sectarian and inward afflictions without any offense.

To the most illustrious highborn prince and lord, Lord John Frederick, Duke of Saxony and Elector, Archmarshall of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most gracious lord. 

G. and peace in Christ with my poor prayer 2c. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Antonius Schenitz has asked me to write to E. C. F. G. and ask, because he has had to leave Halle, and the unfortunate priest is urging on the friendship, that they should give Hans Schenitz' registers of themselves, and Duke Georgen has _ already managed to do so, that he has immediately commanded that they should place such registers behind the council in Leipzig. What this means is easy to calculate. Therefore, the said Antonius Schenitz asks E. [C.] F. G. to be your gracious lord, and to let them have their registers in E. C. F. G. lands and protect them from violence. For they rightly ask for it and will gladly wait for it. Since both, Bishop and Duke George, would undoubtedly not suffer in their territories from C.C.F.G. that they would do violence to someone under their rule, but would rightfully direct all things, it is fair that C.C.F.G. do so in such a case. Accordingly, my humble request is that E. C. F. G. will justly grant gracious protection to such good people who are so shamefully overpowered, as | trust that E. C. F. G. will ever show mercy and Christianity. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ

But if you do not want to forgive or reconcile, which | most earnestly implore and request, | will leave the matter with the Lord and comfort myself with many passages from the Holy Scriptures.

Many have lost their ink; some have also eaten their mother's letters, from which they have gained heartache and a longing for their fatherland, and there may be more such weaknesses than | can relate.

We have heard the contents of your letter, which you have now sent to us on behalf of the Chaplain Ern Johann Mantel concerning a fief, which was transferred to our monastery after the death of Ern Peter Jiiterbock, and which Ern Hieronymo Weller has sent to us on account of the money he has outside of it.

We will then inquire about the forfeited fief and let you hear our gracious answer, and we will also show you that the Weller should be given his money in escrow. In our gracious opinion, we do not want you to do this, and we are graciously inclined to do so. Date at Weimar, Tuesday after Alexii [July 20] Anno Domini 1535.

We would have liked to keep him, but so that we would not give rise to any suspicion in such hopeful unity, we have allowed him to see that we would like to do so with all our will that such unity be confirmed. Without this we would not have let him; for he is a learned, pious, faithful man, whom we would have needed from now on. And if it should happen that some preachers might not be pleased with him, then we want him 1) E. F. seriously; for if 2) it would not be convenient for him to stay in Augsburg himself, we have asked him very kindly to come to us again.

Grace and peace in Christ! | wish you happiness in those joys of yours, although | also wish you all the glories you mention, my dear Jonas, if they could be granted to you in this place (the rumor of our pestilence is quite null and void, or rather nullity itself), but it was decided in heaven that Satan separated us according to the body; who knows by what monstrosity. M. Philip has been summoned by the King of France, and he would also like to travel according to my advice. Only he could not obtain this from the prince; he left here again for Jena rather unwillingly; what will happen, | do not know.

There is a strange loneliness here in the city, but we are, thank God, healthy and live quite comfortably, except that there is absolutely no beer in the city.

I, who have often been deceived by pretended (fictas) nuns and great whores, had to be cautious and consider my danger, otherwise | would have gutted her with due honors and soon delivered her to her relatives again. That Jew, her seducer, has a very bad name, also his parents. We believe, | also believe, that he is rightly slain. Therefore, if they are still with you when you receive this letter, may you also comfort the wife in my name and charge the brother that he remember my protection, indeed, his own promise for the wife.

We are here in the midst of death in the liver; our plague is made great without measure, although no one dies another death than that which is usual in all times of dying. If a child dies, it must soon have been the plague. The devil has mocked us by several deaths that were carried off two months ago by a contagious disease (contagio).

Wittenberg. September 1, 1535. 


To Justus Jonas. 


Luther is glad that the court does not involve him in the negotiations with the King of France, and now wishes himself that Melanchthon does not go to France. About the upcoming doctorate. 


Manuscript at Wolfenbittel in Cod. Helmst. 107 and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill. From the Frick Collection at Ulm in Schitze, vol. Il, p. 351 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 627. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1428. 


Grace and peace in Christ! | know nothing of the letter of reply to the king, my dear Jonas, and since the king has not written, in my opinion the most advisable thing would have been that nothing be answered to him, and it is a matter of perhaps giving them an opportunity to reply as well. But the Court is wise, and is pleased to be a doer, and we even prefer to be spectators rather than doers. One day they too would like to have been spectators and not so wise, acting persons. For | now begin to rejoice especially that we are despised and excluded from the court, and | interpret it to mean that this is by God's grace, so that we are not mixed up in these troubles, over which we might one day have to sigh. But now we are sure that everything that is happening is happening without our knowledge, and we attain early what Demosthenes wished for late, namely, that we will not be called upon to govern. God confirm this, amen. 

There is a general rumor about the French envoys, even from the best men. 


1) Luther means the archbishop of Halle; see the following letter. 





| also did not want Philip to travel with them. The suspicion arises that the right envoys were killed on the journey, and the papists equipped them with letters to drag Philip away. And you know the bishops of Mainz, Liége and others, the worst tools of the devil, who increase my concern for Philip; | have written to him diligently about this matter. "The world is of the devil, and the devil is of the world." | hold my disciple at Halle very suspicious, if only for the reason that he trampled underfoot Philip's interpretations of the Epistle to the Romans, which were dedicated to him, with frightening scolding. 2) "He has St. Velten by the neck" and many other evils, but so much is missing that he should be led to repentance and self- knowledge by these punishments and disgraces, that he even becomes angrier daily; perhaps because he is unwilling (after the devil's manner) that God does not give, do and suffer as much as his rage desires. Enough of this. 

By the way, by this letter the new future doctors call you and ask you to come to the disputation and to conduct the doctorate by performing the office of the promoter. We would give you a speech to praise theology, but we feared Roscius would laugh at us if he became a spectator. But even a cabbage gardener often speaks in a fitting manner. It would please us if you would emphasize the point that theology is such: if in this life everything has been arranged by other arts in a visible or also in a hidden way, mau must nevertheless at the end, when one must die, and wander from the exceedingly beautiful and happy and lovely scene of this life, then nevertheless worry, search, call for this poor, meager, despised manger in Bethlehem, and those people their crowns, majesties, dominions, arts and gifts will help nothing. There you have a spark in the tinder. Farewell in Christ. On the first day of September Anno 1535. Yours Martin Luther, D. 


2) Here De Wette has mistakenly a colon, because he took the following words as spoken by the Archbishop of Mainz (so did Walch), but they are Luther's words about him.

Our willing services before. Dear Lord! We gladly and with joy hear that after the cities of Strasbourg, Augsburg, and our preachers, through the special negotiation of Buceri, Strasbourg's ecclesiastical minister, offered you a concord of the dangerous division of the reverend sacrament before this time and have long since begun against you, that the same unanimity has now been brought to good peace, end, and decency, for which reason we thank God Almighty and ask Him justly to preserve this well- created work for the time being in perpetuity; and although we, along with all states of the laudable Christian understanding, are all along heard in the commandment to subscribe to the Confession not only in this, but also in all other articles, as handed over by our most gracious Lord, the Elector of Saxony, and his co-relatives at the Imperial Diet of Augsburg, half of the doctrine, and thus, with their electors, to the Confession of the Holy Roman Emperor. Gn. have always been and still are in agreement; Now that all means of harmony and final concord have been found between our towns, our prebendaries and you, we hope for even more fruitful and greater benefits, have a special favor for it, and herewith admonish you out of good zeal and Christian heart, that you will henceforth not take less care of such Christian ways as we doubt to happen, so that this unanimity will be constantly preserved, and for the time being further peace and reconciliation 1) will be planted and established. We want to promote this with ours to the best of our ability, and, that this may proceed commendably between both parts, we ask God the Lord for urgent earnestness, and we are also inclined to prove service and friendship 2) to you. Date Friday after Egidii [Sept. 3] 1535.

Joking invitation to the doctor's feast.3) Of the emperor's victory in Africa. 


Handwritten in Wolfenbittel in Cod. Helmst. 107, and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 225. Printed in Schutze, vol. Il, p. 361 and in De Wette, vol. | V, p. 629. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1430. 

Grace and peace! | hope you have received the letters and the disputations, my dear Jonas, at the same time also that we as the pig [you] wanted to teach the Minerva what you should say at the graduation. Now the head cook (Archimagirus) asks you, my mistress Kathe, that after receiving this thaler you buy for us birds, poultry and flying animals, and everything that is subject to the rule of man (that can be eaten) in that airy realm of the feathered, but (for God's sake) no ravens; but the sparrows we very much wish to devour even all at once; and if you lay out something more, it will be reimbursed to you. Then, if you can buy some rabbits or similar delicacies, or hunt for free, send it, for we are thinking of filling the bodies of all of you, if otherwise that potion will succeed, which is called cythus [beer]. For my lord Kathe has cooked seven quarters (quartalia, as they are called), into which she has mixed 32 bushels of malt, wanting to satisfy my taste. She hopes it will be a good beer. What it will be, you will taste with the others. 

There is nothing new, except what you know about the Emperor's victories in Africa. But Duke George and the Bishop of Halle had a meeting and decided to enjoin their people to fast three days every week for the Emperor, and to take the form of the sacrament, so that everything will go out more happily in the future. Now, if the Emperor should gain Constantinople (which God will give), it will not be because of God. 


3) The two doctorands are, as Luther writes in No. 2150 to the Elector, Hieronymus Weller and UI. Johann Medler. Seidemann in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 518, note 2, erroneously names Georg Rorarius [R6rer] instead of Weller.

but the three days of fasting and the one form of the sacrament. This is indeed the poet's word: 1) that those who have the wit that you have, easily transfer to themselves the honor that is brought about by other people's work. Now | understand why Terence calls that Thraso a disgraceful 2) man. But these words are those of Scipio and Lalius, not of Terence. But Christ lives and sees these unspeakable wickednesses of devils and men. But we also live and are merry at this wrath of devils and men, and even want to feast and make a feast, while those miserably bare their teeth, especially when you cheerfully arrive at our place with these captured feathered animals, and force them, after they have left the completely free realm of the air, to go into the prison of the pots under the urban herd. My Kathe sends you and all yours her friendly and respectful greetings. But listen, again, if mine greets you, | also greet yours; like must be repaid with like. Fare well in the Lord. 1535 Sept. 4, 3) Your Martin Luther.

3) Only Walch gives this undoubtedly correct date. Schutze lists the letter under November 7. 





and has faithfully administered his office up to now; my dear George, help him as much as you can. For it is cruel that Christ's poor should be so afflicted by ours, and this licentiousness of the nobility will do great harm to the Gospel. | therefore recommend him to you. 

There is no news, except that Doctor Antonius is here, that black Englishman, as envoy of his king to our prince, and he desires that M. Philippus go to England to talk with the king. Hartmuth von Kronberg was here and was looking for his sister. This very honorable woman was indeed here for several months, unknown to us all. A certain Jew had kidnapped her, who was a widow, and made her his wife. But he was killed on the way by his relatives, she, called by his relatives in peace, came from Silesia. It is written that the cities of Greece summoned the Emperor Carl as a liberator from the Turkish tyranny. The happiness of this man is unheard of, may Christ accomplish it, amen. Of our plague | know nothing, so all lie everything. It is said of many persons that they have been buried for three days, and behold, they live quite well. May God punish these shameful people who are masters in lying and deceiving the people. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me.

Dear Doctor! We have received two letters of your dignity, pleasing and offering, besides our envoy, Doctor Gereon Seiler's, relation, done to us for his homecoming, of which everything, especially also the diligence, on our part, first with our dear Lord Doctor Urbano Regio, and subsequently, when he could not be raised, with Magister Johann Férster, and then demonstrated other goodwill to the aforementioned our envoy, we thank him kindly, and request that he return this to us for your sake. W. in return and to owe it to you. Then we further enjoy the beloved settlement, achieved by means of divine graces. As much as we (if God wills) do not want to omit anything that might be in its favor, but do not want to undertake or allow anything that might be detrimental or detrimental to it, but [promote it, so] 1) we have given our special dear and good friends, those of Strasbourg, Ulm and other cities in the upper part of the country, such an accepted agreement and received joy through the above-mentioned Doctor Gereon, who have been pleased by it no less than we, and, as much as in them, are also willing to keep it, as E. W. has also heard from them themselves. W. will also hear from them himself. Hereupon our friendly request comes to your dignity, whether sooner or later something (important) would be attributed to the association, in advance by special persons, or otherwise indicated, that they do not believe the same indications behind the back of the superiors, but always want to make such indications and other their concerns known to the 2) superiors themselves, and then hear their report. For if some misguidance, sects or repugnant teachings, which God would graciously prevent, would arise among us, we are inclined to stop such seductions with God's help in due time and to turn them to betterment according to E. W.'s well-founded (grounded) counsel, nor are we less inclined than other Christian estates or members of eager diligence. For God Almighty may graciously preserve E. W. for the consolation of the Christian churches in long-lasting health and keep us all in constant unity. Date on September 8, 1535.

Johann Forster in Augsburg to Luther. (Regest.) Forster reports that the council, after hearing him preach for thirteen days, gave him the parish of St. Johannis with the approval of all the preachers of the city. 


1) Added by us. 2) Burkhardt: "dem". 


The ceremonies and customs were quite different from those in Wittenberg, but he believed that they could be tolerated. The Lord's Supper is publicly acknowledged to have the body and blood of Christ present, but not as much as the Wittenbergers; this is due to their ignorance and not to their malice, for they strive to maintain the concord. They are right about baptism. In the sermons and in the treatment of the Word, the clergy are very similar to their masters Zwingli, Oecolampad, Pellican, Bucer 2c. Forster wanted to push the article of justification, then also the doctrine of the two sacraments. About the plague that reigns in Augsburg and continues to spread. He asks "Luther" to answer the imperial cities, and that he keep Melanchthon from traveling to France because of the king's disloyalty and cruelty. A series of greetings.

You may in good conscience (because the pastor does not suffer it) allow the gospel to be preached at Halls for your household alone, 1) but excluding the other parishioners. For because the pastor wants to let you have it in the house, you may take so long until it is forbidden by force; for you are not guilty for the sake of others who are forced by force majeure to oppose you. In this each one must dare himself, and stand his own adventure. Furthermore, do not be mistaken whether the preachers are not smeared or shamed by the suffragan bishop; for they are not ordained to the office of preaching, but to the corner mass, and are the priests Baal and Hieroboam 2c. He who is called is consecrated, and shall preach to those who call him; this is our Lord God's consecration and right Chresem 2c. My housewife sends her kind regards to you and the festering ones.

To George, Prince of Anhalt. 


Luther sends back the written remarks of George about the Pabstthum praising, says that it is nothing with the plague in Wittenberg, and thanks for his gifts to the Doctorschmause (Wellers and Medlers on 14 Sept.). 


In Lindner, Mittheilungen, p. 27 and in De Wette- Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 163. The postscript, which is found by Seidemann to this letter (in Lindner, p. 29 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 198), belongs according to the investigations of Burkhardt in Dessau (Burkh. p. 496) to the letter of Sept. 29, 1536. 


1) In the editions: "to let", but it is in any case the same as the immediately following "to let up". 





To the highly famous and very good Prince and Lord, Lord George, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien, Lord in Bernburg; highly respected (magnifico) Provost of the Church in Magdeburg, his most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | am sending back to 

E. F. G., Your Serene Highness, the very meaningful thoughts which E. F. G. has compiled against the pontifical unrhymed ungodliness, and not only the matter itself pleased me, but much more the wonderful diligence of E. F. G. in collecting and explaining them. F. G. to collect and explain them. May the Lord Jesus beget and increase this spirit in the heart of E. F. G., and may he also plant it with much fruit in the church, amen. 

| hear of our plague that extraordinarily frightening 

things are raised by it abroad, although, as Christ is my witness, not even one person has been found who had a bump (apostema, as it is called), which nevertheless tends to occur with this disease; if there is any plague, it must surely be an internal poison, a pestilential fever, as it were (as the physicians call it). Then the deaths are very rare, often neither a corpse nor a disease is found in the whole three days in the city. On one or two days there are two or three corpses, but most of them are children and people who have been carried off by a long illness, as it also happens outside the plague season. For four years ago there were either as many or more deaths, although there was no plague, than there are now. Summa: "If it is a dying, then it is a secret dying, since more are born than die," so that we can say: In the midst of death we are in life, and both in Torgau and in Leipzig there are more dying than in Wittenberg. But Satan, since GOD allows it, has by this larva of pestilence scattered this school and troubled the church. This he has wanted from of old, but may Christ tread him down quickly, Amen. This is what | thought I had to tell E. F. G., so that she would not be moved by these rumors of Satan; the other will be communicated by the very good man, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann.

Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony to Luther, Jonas, Bugenhagen, Melanchthon and Cruciger. 


News of the incoming message from England and instructions for its reception. 


The concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 99. 42. Printed by Burkhardt", p. 233. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotees and faithful! Since it is not known to you that the King of England recently had his orator, Doctor Antonia Barnes, with us and had him do some canvassing: Because the same doctor let himself be heard, among other things, that the said king would send a noble embassy hereafter, which would talk with you as our theologians about several articles and hold friendly conversations and colloquia, he sought from us on behalf of the said king that we would order you to listen to the embassy's arrival, and to talk and confer with it. Since we are then inclined to comply with the king's request, and have agreed to do so with respect to the above-mentioned orator, we graciously request that when the aforementioned embassy arrives in Wittenberg, you wait for it to arrive there, or where it might remain in Wittenberg due to death, or where it might be held in that place. 


1) Burkhardt has placed this letter at the beginning of July, but remarks (p. 233, note): "The letter of credence for the first English embassy is dated from Greenwich 8 Feb, for the second from Windsor for Dr. Barnes from 8 July. Nevertheless, this letter cannot be placed chronologically. It belongs to the time when the plague had seriously broken out in Wittenberg, but the university had not yet moved to Jena." On the other hand, Késtlin, M. Luther, vol. Il, p. 669 ad p. 375, note 2, says: "Fox's legation was (Corp. Ref., vol. Il, 941) announced by Barnes to the Elector in September, with which the letter is to be placed in the same time by Burkhardt, p. 233 f." We have followed the time determination assumed by K6stlin. 





We request that you, at our expense, take your message with you to Torgau, and listen to it with good will, and let us hear it with a good reply, and otherwise show us as much fairness and dignity as we can graciously provide for you. What you will hear of the same message and what you will consider to be a conversation, let us know before the message arrives here, so that we may be able to respond to your request all the more conveniently. We do not wish to deprive you of this, and do us the favor of doing so, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date. 


Note: Because we may well consider that no final settlement will follow between the embassy and you, just as you will not enter into a final union or consent to it, even if it were to happen, but want to delay the decision for moving causes until our return, God willing, and report it to us beforehand in the content of this document, we did not want to restrain you either.

Grace and peace in Christ. My dear Magister Gabriel! | am sorry that your people of Torgau are so ungrateful against the Gospel and dare to make you, priest and chaplains, their servants out of their own thirst, to demand their pleasure in the town hall. Who has taught them such violence? 


1) In the original: "lintworms", that is the Cardinal at Mainz. 

2) "for the court right", that is, at will. 3) At the above-mentioned location in the archives at Dresden is the concept of the answer of the Elector to Luther, dated October 6, 1535, in which Antonius Schénitz is promised protection and advised to let the letters go out in print. 





that is not theirs to steal away to themselves? Are these the fruits of their faith? Well then, because they have been so forgotten and have fallen from the faith, you again shall not do anything they want. For we have redeemed them from the pope's infallible tyranny with great toil and labor, and still fight for their freedom without ceasing, and they go on, and want to trample us underfoot, and strengthen the pope, and revile us: so let their presumption be accursed, amen. No other city does it without some of the nobility. But if they want to have a priest for a servant, they must appoint him, provide him with food, shelter and all necessities. If you have nothing from them, they will not let you have any civil food, and you are neither sworn nor bound to them; and you shall nevertheless be imprisoned like another citizen, and probably more. | will do this, that they shall lose the election of a parish lord again. For all is due to the prince, who shall give a stork to peck at the head of the rude frogs. Can they not suffer, the unreasonable fellows, that they have all church services in vain, and have been freed by the pope without any effort? And Halle, Leipzig, Dresden 2c. would probably give big money for it, and gladly carry such preachers on their hands. | have to come and break the bristles of the mother preacher in the pulpit. So stay away from the council house, and do not mix the two regiments together, and do not let them mix either; for it would be annoying to the common man, and unpleasant to the prince, if he were to learn that his servants, who have fiefs and everything from him, are to be made servants to foreign lords. 5) If they are rude, proud, and proud, and unruly, they are to be made servants to foreign lords. If they have become rude, proud and unreasonable, and God blinds them because of their unbelief, we do not have to follow them, nor do we approve. Hereby commanded by GOD, Amen. Martin Luther. 


This writing is given at Wittenberg, the next day after Michaelmas [Sept. 30] between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning Anno 1535, and Doctor Luther said, this writing may be shown to princes and lords.

About the rumor of the plague in Wittenberg. 


(Wittenberg.) 


From the original in Uckert's handwritten collection in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 635 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 109. To the strict, honorable Johann Riedtesel zum Neumarkt, my favorable lord and dear godfather. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Dear Lord and Godfather! | had nothing to write about this time, but | did not want to let Magister Jacobum come, so he will tell you everything about the situation here. Dying is said to be very great here, as they say. For outside of Wittenberg, everything is better known, neither we ourselves in the city. And the further from Wittenberg, the more they know, as it is customary: the further the lie wanders, the fatter and thicker, bigger and stronger, more beautiful and [complete] 1) it becomes.

To the Mayor and City Council of Augsburg. 

Luther wishes that the unity of the two churches may always exist from now on. 

The original is in the city archives of Augsburg. Printed in the twelfth annual report of the historical district association for the administrative district of Swabia and Neuburg for the year 1846, p. 70; in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 197 (with the wrong date: "Oct. 25") and in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 164. 

To the honorable, prudent gentlemen, mayor and council of the imperial city of Augsburg, my favorable lords and good friends. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Honorable, prudent, dear gentlemen! | am truly delighted in Christ from E. F.'s writings, from which | have heard how E. F. and your church preachers, leaders and congregations have so warmly liked my answer through Mr. Gereon, Doctor, and so earnestly inclined to unity with us. May the Father of all comfort and peace continue to give the spirit of His dear Son JEsu Christ in all our hearts, to increase and grow, so that such unity may remain thorough and pure from now on, so that one day the sighing of many pious hearts may cease, which spirit has been saddened by such a chip, and the papists may stop their revenge: Papists their revenge be stopped, who always boasted: Behold, they themselves are not one among themselves, and are excellently strengthened thereby in __ their abominations. | will (as | wrote before) leave nothing to be lacking in me, if God wills, and will not let such comfort and joy, which my dear God still shows me before my end, be taken away nor hindered, and | stand in right good hope that Christ has come with grace between and among us and wants to cast out the discordant spirit, and, as E. F. asks, | will not believe what else would be said to yours, for | have previously reported it all to E. F. and them. What | have also written to your preachers about a convention, they will report to you and will know how to use E. F.'s advice. F.'s counsel in this matter. 

Christ, our dear Lord, strengthen E. F. with the right spirit to promote his holy name, kingdom and good pleasure, Amen. Wittenberg, quinto Octobris 1535.

To the City Council of Esslingen. 


Luther invites the people of Esslingen to participate in a convention to be held by other cities and preachers because of the settlement negotiations. 


The original is in EBlingen. Printed in Keller, Geschichte der Stadt EBlingen, p. 199; in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 640 and in the Erlanger Ausg. vol. 55. p. 110. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, prudent, dear lords and friends! | am heartily pleased with your writing that | notice how your hearts and minds are inclined by God's grace to the settlement among us, so that the irritation of the discord may come to an end. May our dear Lord God confirm such grace in you, and you should take it for granted that with God's help | will allow myself to be found unsaved in all things that are possible; for | have come into such hope that God has allowed such a cleavage and rift to come among us, that we might be tempted and humiliated. But He can make all things good out of evil, as He makes all things out of nothing. Therefore, please continue to pray and strive, so that such unity may become firm and lasting, and your devil may have his jaws stopped, who boasted of such disunity and immediately shouted, "Hah, won! and cried out at once. 

| have written to the other cities and preachers that they want to discuss whether it should not be necessary for us preachers to meet in one place to talk about this and other things verbally. | put this into your consideration, and you will know how to act with the others and let us know. Command you hereby to the dear, faithful God eternally, Amen. Wittenberg, quinto Octobris 1535.

To Caspar Huberinus in Augsburg. 


Huberinus had asked Luther whether or not he should accept the assistantship offered to him by the Council with Wolfgang Mauslin (Musculus), a Sacramentarian. Luther advised him to do so, since it was a sign that they wanted to be unanimous in doctrine. 


From an old writing: Wie die kais. Augsburg was first besieged by the Rottengeistern, but finally conquered by the Schwarmer, in Cod. chart. 91. f. Bibl. Bibl. Goth. f. 95. In De Wette, vol. IV, p. 642 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 111. 

To the faithful disciple and servant of Christ, 

Casparn Huberino, his dear brother in Christ the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Perhaps the matter for which you have asked me has now _ been accomplished, especially if the messenger has remained so long. For the messenger fell among the robbers, who took everything from the messenger and tied him to a tree. | have had many thoughts because he was out so long and did not come back soon. But now to the matter at hand. It seems to me that the council of Augsburg has its special concern that they want you to be Mauslin's helper, namely that they want to have publicly testified that they are unanimous with us in the doctrine. For | cannot, nor do | want to, get used to the contradiction, especially so soon in the beginning of the renewed concord. For this reason, it is my honest opinion that you will serve them in this case. For the time being, | know nothing more to write to you, except that after the end of winter, as | hope, we will come together in a convention, where we will act in the presence of all sorts of things. Meanwhile, suffer and endure whatever you can and may, so that we will not be a cause for preventing the friendship that has begun. God keep you, and pray God for me. May the Lord be with you always with His Spirit of abundant blessing, Amen. Oct. 5, 1535 Martin Luther.

Melanchthon to Luther. 


Melanchthon complains about the unpleasant conditions in Jena, so that he wants to work toward his return to Wittenberg. About the negligence of the civil servants in paying the salaries. 


From Melanchthon's own manuscript in Cod. Rhedig Vratisl. Vol. V, transcribed by S. V. Schulzius, printed in the Corp. Ref. 


To the venerable Mr. Martin Luther, Doctor of Theology, his extremely dear father. 

Hail! After the departure of the prince, we have, here at least, received no news; nor has Christoph, that English messenger, returned to us. Therefore, | will write only about private things. There is such a great lack of many things here that | think, as far as | can judge and foresee, that we will not be able to maintain our household here in the winter. Therefore, as soon as we meet, | will speak to the council concerning the return. For now Cruciger is also absent, and the legal scholars are absent. We are suffering severe punishments for our foolishness, and especially |, that we left there by following a foreign judgment rather than our own. 

Brick reminded the prince about your salary. If you have not received it, let me know. For the prince's commandments are extraordinarily neglected. Blank (? Pluncus) does not pay us. Also the others, from whom the scholastici (students) receive money, do not send anything. Therefore, you can easily calculate the state of our affairs. What do you say to the fact that the prince himself has withdrawn people from our academy, whose absence causes not a little damage to the studies. But | want to stop. You are quite well and happy and greet respectfully in my name your most honorable wife. On the day before Luca [Oct. 17].

Jonas, | will send you the reading material myself, as my laziness advises me, which you will send back. The Augsburg messenger had left when your letter arrived. | will send it to Leipzig 2c. if | can. 

With the robbers 1) the thing behaves in such a way: When he had left Magdeburg, and was still three miles in the bishop's territory, near Andersleben, he fell among the robbers who had ambushed those returning from the fair to Magdeburg. They held "the deadly thing" under his nose and forced him to give up his horse, as well as the excellent animal that the Augsburgers had sent as a gift to Duke Ernst, and after receiving his travel money, 13 florins, they tied him to a tree and left, having received an oath that he would not raise a cry or complaint for three hours. Thus he stood abandoned in the forest for two hours, exposed to the wild beasts; at last, after the ropes had been loosened by tugging and pulling, he came on foot to the captain of some castle. He sent to the prince, who sent him back with clothes and travel money, and also with a horse. Again, these robbers dare many things. | also send [the report about] the wedding bash of the Polish bride. Besides, there is nothing | could write. Schnepf will put your smith (fabrum) before you through his letter. But that faithless Jew, to whom we have procured ten florins here, runs these things. For Philip describes him in his letter as being very bad. Magister Sehusen was buried yesterday; the plague took him, and he followed his wife. My Hans was frightened by my carter, but when the matter was properly examined, he soon got up; he was afflicted with a slight fever. Otherwise, all is well, and they are pure, but perhaps not all; but one swallow does not make a summer.

| brought you a question about a certain woman who is plagued by the devil, my dear pastor, and although | am forced to write very briefly, since | am burdened with such a large amount of business, | still wanted to answer you, because this Theobald Diedelhuber was supposed to be the letter carrier, if only to recommend him to you. 

First, your congregation must do this with you, that they may pray hard and stand firm in faith against Satan, even though he resists stubbornly. We suffered a very bad devil in these parts for about ten years, but we finally subdued him through perseverance with continued prayer and unquestioning faith. The same will happen to you if you continue to despise that mocking and hopeful spirit in Christ again, and do not cease 1) to pray. | have subdued many spirits in many places by this advice, because the prayer of the church finally has the upper hand. Therefore, you too will not doubt that if you pray truly and persistently, that spirit will be humbled. 

The second is this, that you take careful care that there is not some fraud in that woman, by which you are all mocked. For | too, through my own experience (not to mention what | have read in books), have found such frauds, so that afterwards my simplicity brought me great reproach. For this spirit takes pleasure in it (as he used to do from the beginning), if he can make Adam a fool through a woman, if he cannot make him an ungodly, although he desires this much more. Summa, whatever it may be, whether in this woman or in others you mention, whether it be an incubus, a succubus 2) and disguised [disguised] in all monstrous shapes, we still know that it is the devil. Therefore, we must not carelessly accept either his poems or deeds, nor even his searches and ghosts, but fight against him in faith and prayer. He lives whom he crucified. But again

Luther advises him to refer a marriage matter to the lawyers. Of several articles that Melanchthon was supposed to have written. 


Manuscript in Cod. 689, p. 74 and at Wolfenbittel in Cod. Gud. 214. Printed from the Gleichische Sammlung at Dresden by Schitze, vol. Il, p. 358 and by De Wette, vol. IV, p. 647. 


To Leonhard Beier, pastor at Zwickau. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Of course, it would be best, my dear Beier, if you dismissed the marriage matter from you, which | also tend to do when | can. Thus Christ says: "Let the dead bury their dead." "If the lawyers want to be wise, let them be so on their conscience; what do we ask of their 'shithouse’, who preach the eternal kingdom? We advise the conscience, we do not give laws, so that if people have done against the law, we can save them in danger. Therefore, in this matter, you depart, and let them do what they will, What is their judgment to us, who teach everything in the court of conscience? But to the peasants, who everywhere ridicule the gospel and yet like freedom, | would also forbid [marriage] in the tenth degree, or rather in prison. Therefore nothing is to be conceded to them in conscience, since they do not allow themselves to be bound by any conscience. "Let the peasants come and remain among the lawyers," Amen. 

| am sending copies of the articles 3) you write about. The papists have made miraculous things of these articles everywhere, but their fame will be disgraced. M. Philip did not publish them, and great injustice is done to him, more [but even more] to the Elector 4) and to us all; it has

You need have no doubt about the happy journey of our prince to Prague. Philip writes for the third time that Brick is in Jena. Perhaps it is Bleikard.3) For he is with the prince, and things and people are mixed up, both because Brick was ill before, and Bleikard went with the prince as if he were Brick.

To the highly respectable and worthy men, the faithful servants of the church at Frankfurt, his brothers who are exceedingly dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace, in Christ! | have received your 

letter and your letter that you handed over to the council, worthy men. And what shall | do, who until this day have been uncertain both about the state of your church and about the will of the council? | thought that Cellarius was expelled, Dionysius dismissed, and | saw that you all still disagree among yourselves: since my ignorance is so great, | can determine nothing among you as an arbiter. It has indeed pleased me your admonition to the council, which is too strong for them to follow, as | understand from their letter. What shall | advise, if they (as they say) cannot do what you teach? Let them therefore do what they can or will. For | am suspicious of many, even in other places, who, after the gospel has been lost and the church servants have been expelled, nevertheless want to preserve the freedom of the gospel that they have gained. That is, the world wants to be papist (papistare) and epicurean with contempt for all religions of all people. Now even the papists despise the pope through the gospel, only that they worship the pope in a masquerade of the theater, as it were, for the sake of appearances and because they have other things in mind. Again, they despise the Gospel, but under a different pretense: "But | have bought a country house, | have taken a wife, | cannot come. What can be done here but to let those be unclean who are unclean, and those who err, and let the deceivers become worse? "They will have it so." Act ye faithfully, and, as Jude saith, pluck as it were out of the fire them which ye can; them which ye cannot, let them burn, and be not grieved of them. What more can ye do, if ye also would rend yourselves? You will not bring the whole heap to Christ, but only the firstfruits and the rest, or the rest of the heap.

Dear Sirs, Dear Sirs, Dear Sirs, Dear Sirs! | have written diligently to M. Johann Cellarium after receiving your letter, and for many reasons | would like to see him back with you at Frankfort.

"The priest Albrecht in Halle took away the abbot's staff in Zinna and the monstrances in Jiterbock, along with many other chalices, out of great devotion, so that he also put down letters sealed by him in their place. It is said that that shepherd's staff (pedum) of an abbot and the monstrance amount to a great sum. In truth, he is worthy to have become a cardinal, since he competes happily with all cardinals by his gifts, and will surpass them in short, if he is allowed. For in Rome and in Italy they have stripped all the churches of altars, masses, revenues and jewels, and yet they still strictly demand the masses and the services (cultus) of the churches. You think that Verres or Dionysius is something significant, if you believe Cicero; but now a reverend cardinal of the holy Catholic Church not only has a hundred Verres, a thousand Dionysius in his heart, but practices them publicly and brazenly in open works. "How do such princes and lords suffer" who so plague us with the crime of raping the churches! We expect you to return, and if a rumor should come to you, endure it and overcome it. We hope, even if there should be some pestilence, still (instead of this scythian heaven) to have a pure air. "It would have to turn out differently" if it were a plague; everywhere people are mortal, are born and die. "We don't all have to stay alive here on earth, otherwise we won't get there." My lord [Kathe] greets you reverently and remembers you often, and you see to it that you do not make me zealous.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


The Elector summons Luthern to Jena to negotiate with the English Embassy. 2) 


From the Weimar Archives, Concept 8, x. 97, No. 41, in Burkhardt, p. 242.2) 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! After the Royal Sovereigns of England have now sent their messages to us, which also arrived in Erfurt a few days ago, and which we have sent to Weimar, things as you have undoubtedly heard from Doctor Antonio, the Angelic, 3) who has now been in Wittenberg for some time, and although it was stated that the said embassies had first arrived in Wittenberg, and that they were to hold discussions with you and other of our theologians on account of the matters concerned, for which they were dispatched; But since this did not happen, and they are so close to our city of Jena (Jhene), where at this time Magister Philippus Melanchthon and our 4) university is located, | consider that such a discussion at this time cannot be held in any place better and more convenient, and especially since we are closer at hand than in Jena, than there: Therefore, it is our gracious request that you rise up in a favorable manner and dispose of yourselves to Jena, and, in addition to Magister Philippo and other of our theologians, be assured of the above-mentioned messages. 


1) The year is wrong. (De Wette.) 

2) Burkhardt notes: "On the same day a similar invitation was sent to Anton Barnes, from which it follows that the second English embassy did not take its way to Wittenberg, as was intended, but had arrived in Erfurt a few days before December 6. In three days, thus on December 9, Johann Friedrich wanted to be in Weimar and to humble the embassy there, in order to let then the discussion with Luther proceed in Jena. Nevertheless, on December 31, 1535, the English embassy arrived in Wittenberg, where it stayed and was fed for several months. 

3) In concept: "of the angel lender". 

4) Burkhardt: "ours". 

5) "thun" put by us instead of: "him".

Melanchthon to Luther.

To Doctor Martin Luther. 

We hope that the affairs of the Prince with King Ferdinand are aligned, because Franz 6) wrote extremely pleasant things in the last letter. The Prince wrote the same to Briick. | have, however, seen Faber's intrigues; but | will hear [more] 7) from Franz, for we expect the Prince's arrival today. Antonius, the Englishman, has come here, but | have not yet greeted him, for | am just returning from an examination of the Anabaptists. We discussed five articles. For they hold that there is no sin in little children; that Christians are not permitted to administer an office of authority or to take an oath; they teach that all goods are common; they deny that a marriage is between an Anabaptist and a non- Anabaptist. These gross things | have drawn out, that they might be convicted. Be well. Greetings in my name to your honorable wife, D. Jonas and D. Pommer. Jena, on the day of Nicolai [Dec. 6] 1535.

Mr. Friedrich Myconius, the faithful servant of the

Grace and peace in Christ! We are sending back your John, who was called and chosen by you, examined by us, and publicly ordained before our congregation under prayers and praises of God as your fellow minister and confirmed by order of our prince, although D. Pommer was not at all willing to do so, since he still thinks that each one should be ordained in his congregation by his elders. This will finally happen when this new cause and ordination has taken deeper root and the custom has become firmer. We commend him to you as he is worthy. And pray for us at the same time as we pray for you. There is nothing new here. May you all be well in Christ. Wednesday after Lucia [Dec. 15] Anno 1535.

To the highly venerable brother in your Lord, Urban Regius, the sincere and faithful servant of Christ at Celle in Saxony. 


Grace and peace in Christ, "who is peace and our consolation. | am not very grieved, my dear Urban, that you show that you suffer the angel of Satan and a stake in your flesh. For by this | know that you are being conformed to the image of the Son of God and all the saints. And | hold that you, as well as other brethren who are in high position, shall suffer this affliction, which shall humble us. Therefore "be confident and undaunted, and wait for the Lord" [Ps. 27:14], who says to Paul [2 Cor. 12:9], "My power is mighty in the weak." He who has called us is faithful, and will make us complete in that day, Amen. This LORD have | heard, and have comforted, as much as the LORD hath given. | have commanded [you] to be of good cheer, and to know that he who is afflicted at times is not alone. For the same happens to our whole! Brotherhood, which is in the world. We must carry one another and be carried. Thus Christ carries us all from the beginning of the world to the end. We cannot always be firm and strong, nor always weak and frail, but as it seems to Him who blows where and when He wills, that He may instruct us by this change, that if we were always firm we should not be hopeful, if we were always weak we should not despair. "He knows what manner of made things we are," says David [Ps. 103:14.] "and that we are dust," and then are at our best when we likewise realize that we are a very dusty and made of dust.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 

The Elector demands Luther's opinion: since Melanchthon had already given his opinion on the marriage case of the King of England, but now the English embassy has expressed the wish that Melanchthon also be present at . the negotiations, whether Melanchthon should be summoned to Wittenberg for this purpose? 

From the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 99, No. 42, printed in Corp. Ref., vol. Ill, 10, No. 1387. 


To Doct. Martin Luther. Johann Friedrich 2c. 

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! After our bailiff in Saxony, Hans Metsch, arrived here yesterday, he reported to us, among other things, that the English embassy would like to see and want us to require and describe Mag. Philipp Melanchthon to Wittenberg, so that he, along with you and other of our fellow citizens, may also be present at the hearing concerning the marriage of the King of England, which is why this embassy to Wittenberg has been ordered. 

Now we do not want to reassure you in your gracious opinion that we noted Philippi’s mind next to Schmalkalden: that he would not be of any use in such a conversation, because he had indicated his reservations beforehand; so necessity would also require that he remain at our university in Jena 2c. Thereby we have left it at that time, and considered, where one could dispense with his touched speech, that it would be best, he would be left at our university in Jena. 

But because we note from our bailiffs report that the English embassy also wanted to have Philip at the speech, 


and we may not know whether this is necessary or not, because we know in advance about your concerns in these matters: our gracious request is that you inform us of your concerns, and also first, if you consider it good, talk to us about it. For if you consider it convenient and useful that Philip should come to Wittenberg for the discussion, we shall not be in want to require him to go there. We have graciously not wished to restrain you from doing so, and we are graciously inclined toward you. Date at Lochau, Sunday after Epiphany [Jan. 9] Anno 1536. 

The original of this letter received by Luther, which is in the von Wallenrodt library in K6énigsberg, still has a handwritten postscript of the Elector, which unfortunately is not completely preserved, since the inserted note is missing, and only what is written on the third page of the letter is still present. It reads (Burkhardt, p. 244, note): 

- - you not also Magister Franz further 

report, which is our concern because of Philippi (Philip), after he has now reported to us how it is happening because of the dislocation of the university. 

As far as the marriage affair with England is concerned, do not doubt me, you will take good care of the matter, 1) that nothing is admitted which may not be Christian and honest before God and the world, and may be misinterpreted and interpreted by our opponents, as no doubt all kinds of inquiries will be made to you for this reason by the message, which | have indicated to you in my gracious opinion, with gracious desire, how things will turn out with the king's and your fortunes, you will actually report such things to me in writings, you do me a special favor, and commend me to your Christian prayer.

2033 





To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most gracious Lord. 

G. and peace in Christ JEsu and my poor Pater Noster. Most noble, highborn Prince, most gracious Lord! | have humbly understood E. C. F. G.'s writing. First of all, for the sake of Magister Philipps, whether he should be required by E. C. F. G. to discuss the King's affairs with the English Embassy along with the rest of us: my humble objection is that Magister Philipps (if he does not want to speak out for himself) should also be present, because E. C. F. G. has not spoken out before the English Embassy. C. F. G. wrote to Doctor Antonio before the train in Austria that he should call us theologians together as soon as the other message arrives, be it here or (if the other legate would shun the pestilence) to Torgau. And that E. C. F. G. indicates that they have heard M. Philipp's opinion at Schmalkalden, | do not know how this happened, or whether they are satisfied with it. | do not want them to make a fuss and shout against us as if they were despised, because without this the stars are so ludicrously against them that | must be very surprised; and yet there is no measure of the high fame and praise of how splendidly they have been held up by E. C. F. G. 2c. 

For my part, | can well grant M. Philip that he will 

be spared such things. Because | am under the suspicion that | will have to pour out this bath, and be it no one or everyone, it will almost (I think) be a big part of me. But | would not like to have Magister Philipp's glimpse provided in this. On the other hand, that E. C. F. G. so faithfully reminds me to take good care of the matter 2c., thank E. C. F. G. with all my heart. But because they are based on E. C. F. G.'s ascription of our own previous request, | must see and hear what they bring; for E. C. F. G. (to indicate in confidence and secretly) should well know that | will not allow myself to be stuck in such a conscience that 





the queen and young queen together with the whole kingdom should be judged incesti and incesta (incestuous) publicly, as they boast that the pope and eleven universities did before. | do not want to delve into their incest, and | can say nothing more about it than a goose gag. But | think that my previous sentence should also remain, because otherwise | do not want to be unkind to them in this or other things, so that they do not think that we Germans are stone and wood 2c. | do not speak such things over tables, as they then also pause until the sting 2c. Otherwise, all stable boys must justify this thing beforehand in the alley and everywhere. This is what E. C. F. G. graciously wished to hear for a gracious answer. Hiemit GOtt commanded, and thanks also E. C. F. G. unterthaniglich for the donated Wildpret 2c. Tuesday after Epiphany [11 Jan] 1536. E. C.F. G. subservient Martinus Luther, D.

Congratulations on starting your marriage and new teaching job in Nuremberg. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. 185. 4; at Wolfenbittel in Cod. Helmst. 85 and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 229. Printed from the collection of Caspar Sagittarius in Jena in Schitze, vol. Ill, p.3; in Strobel's Miscell., 1], 166; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 249 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 664. 


Grace and peace in Christ! We wish you happiness, my dear Veit, that the desired marriage has been granted to you, and | pray for your well-being. But that it does not become too much, that is, that not everything goes beyond the common fate of husbands. 


2034 


Go, lest you make a liar of St. Paul, who presumes to confront us happy and hot-tempered husbands and say [1 Cor. 7:28], "Such people will have bodily afflictions." Now if at times the case should arise that it seems to you that Paul has spoken more truly than you would like: then be you mindful that you prove yourself to be a man who can bear and boast of the weakness of the female, as Peter [1 Ep. 3:7.] teaches, and rather keep the Lesbian Rule than bring righteous wrath upon yourself, and even then you will not concede all power over yourself. But what do | teach, like the sow the Minerva, since the love of marriage still glows so impetuously, since | must know that you can happily rule a hundred manly (marititius) wives (as now is your new one). Much more | wish you happiness in your profession of administration of the Church. | pray and hope at the same time that you will not deviate from the form of the teaching, which you have rather absorbed than drunk here. And | have instructed Doctor Hieronymus Schaller that he should tell you in my name not to let that pagan way of yours (gentile) rule you, although it might tempt you at times, 1) in German it is called "Diinkelfein", that is one who "does the dance well". For you see how great trouble those cause us who have gone out from us. Therefore | want your wife to be greeted by me and asked that she diligently prevent with all her strength of body and soul that you do not become an adulterer with that exceedingly lovely whore, which is called self-conceit (philautia), but prevent and free you from the rut of lust for her, if she should possibly provoke you, as Paul teaches in the letter to Titus Cap. 1,7: xx XXxxxx [Not complacent]; 

You know what he means. Fare well in the Lord. My Lord [Kathe] greets you and wishes you all happiness, both in marriage and in the preaching ministry, and you pray again for us. Wittenberg, 14 January Anno 1536. Yours Martin Luther, D.

From the Wernsdorf collection in Wittenberg in Schitze, Vol. lll, p. 4 and in De Wette, Vol. IV, p. 665. 


To the highly venerable brother in the Lord, Balthasar Raide, the exceedingly faithful and sincere servant of the church at Hersfeld (Hirsfeldensis). 


Grace and peace in Christ! Your letter was delivered to me, dear brother, but by a messenger by chance, so that | could not answer. And because you desire to see my hand, | have written on the back of this paper in large letters. 2) If you can know my hand from this painting, good; if not, then from my mind; | believe that | know not only your hand, but also, through your letter as a witness, your mind. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you in his kingdom. But in the meantime pray also for me, that | too may be delivered from certain ungodly people, as you boast in the Lord that you are delivered from Anabaptists and sects. For me, there are always new prophets rising up, and always one after the other, so that | almost wish to depart, so that | will not see so many evils without end, and | will finally be freed from this kingdom of the devil. This you will ask for me, because | desire it from you. Our Lord Jesus Christ keep thee; in him be thou well. Given on January 17, 1536. Yours Mart. Luther.

To Nicolaus Hausmann in Dessau. 


About a matrimonial matter. About the care of a priest. About the English legation. 


The original is in Dessau. Handwritten at Wolfenbittel in Cod. Helmst. 85 and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 234. From the Hanische Sammlung at Kiel in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 6; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 250 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 666. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1440. 


To the worthy and highly esteemed man, Mr. M. Nic. Hausmann, servant of the Word in Dessau, his superior in the Lord. 


Grace and peace in Christ! | beg you, my dear househusband, to let M[eister] Peter's marriage 1) proceed. For Master Peter has no power over her, since as a widow she has long since been removed from her father's power (emancipata) and _ is independent, and Meister] Peter has also been deprived of the house and all possessions by public court. She marries at her peril, and it is enough that M[eister] Peter had such a sad deal with the former son-in-law that he does not bother much with this now, too, but takes care of his own. 


For the pastor at W6rlitz | do not know of any vacant position at the moment (so that | do not make him nice promises in vain); but if | can, | will gladly be of service to him where any position becomes vacant. 


1) That is, the marriage which Master Peter opposes. We have no doubt that M. Peter means "Master Peter Balbierer", who shortly before Easter 1535 (Easter fell on March 28) stabbed his son-in-law Dietrich at the table. Through Luther's use of the Elector, the death penalty was averted from him (see Veit Dietrich's letter to Fesel in Coburg, Kolde, Analecta, p. 209 f.), but on July 30, 1535 he was sent into exile. If our assumption about the person of M. Peter is correct, we see that Master Peter (probably also through Luther's use) had found a place to stay in Dessau. In Luther's letters we meet M. Peter in Dessau twice more, namely on February 23, 1538, where Luther's Ketha respectfully greets M. Petrum, and on March 27, 1538, where Luther himself greets M. Petrum. Itis remarkable that in the latter place Aurifaber, Schitze and Walch have the reading: "Master Peter’. Cf. St. Louis edition, vol. IX, 1821 ff. 


| have no news except what you have no doubt heard there from M. Francis. The English legation is waiting here for M. Philip to promote the King's cause. But |, who am busy with many things, am becoming less and less adept at the individual ones. My Kathe greets you respectfully; be well in Christ. | will write briefly about Spiegel's and your cause at another time. Again, farewell. On the day of St. Antonii [17 Jan.] Anno 1536.

Grace and peace. My dear Chancellor and Godfather! | would like to write you much for your desire; so | am also ill with cough and cold; but the greatest illness arises with me, that the sun has shone on me so long, which plague you know well that it is mean, and almost many die from it. For people become blind at last from such long shining; some turn gray, black and wrinkled from it. Who knows whether your thigh might also have stepped on a star, which, heated by the sun's brilliance, sent you such days of pain? Although it is not the fault of the dear sun that the dung becomes hard and the wax soft from its shine. The species moves and 2) (moves) itself in every thing; how it is sent, it is found in the last everything.

Porse 1) comes back from Jena, then the table is full, and | cannot expel the old company; but where a place would be free, as may happen after Easter, | will gladly show you my will, where else Herr Kathe will then be gracious to me. 

| know nothing special to write about the English Embassy (how curious you Mansfeld gentlemen are). For the queen is dead; so they say, the Fraulein, the daughter, is also deadly ill. But the matter has lost her with all the world, without us poor beggars, theologians at Wittenberg. They wanted to keep her with royal honors, where she should have lived. That was the end and the decision. 

The pope has acted as a pope in this matter, given contrarias bullas, and thus acted that it has served him right that he has been expelled from England, etiam non Evangelii causa. He has diced the king so well that | almost have to excuse the king's person, and yet | cannot approve of the matter. 

Dear, curse also once the Pater noster against the papacy, that it gets Sanct Velten. The Pabst's orator has been here, as you know; but the answer given to him in Schmalkalden | cannot send now in the hurry. For | had to cough and could not look for it because of the cough; and where the cough would have to subside, | wanted to look for it. But | think the coughing should stop when you pray for me. 

Because the division of the huts has happened to you, | wish you happiness in this. But out of measure | have evil hope; for my theology tells me that men's nobleness and God's blessing are against each other. If it is granted to my dear fatherland, let it be unprovoked for my sake. 

But that neither you, nor Jacob Luther, nor the merchants write how they are doing here, you are almost good fellows, and with your silence you make us poor children (who are here) think that you and they have all become beggars. Nevertheless, God shall feed us, amen.

G. has to make out of one fortnight five 2c. F. G. daily that E. F. G. must make four, five 2c. Fortnight, and when he finally sees his time and mood, he may also reward E. F. G. once, like M.

For he does not only have the suspicion with me, but a big enough cry that he is not to be trusted, and if God already gives him a true word, one should probably not find those who believe him. Therefore, it would be my heart's desire that E. F. G. would leave the man idle and let him be a holy and pious cardinal, where it would be possible for a cardinal to be holy and pious. For they are not called Cardinales a quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus, as the work praises the master and the fruit the tree. Therefore, my request is that E. F.

and | pray to the Lord (Deum) Christ to increase and preserve this happiness of yours with all blessings, Amen. 

Here we are disputing with the English, when disputing means bickering. It is unpleasant to me that our prince is burdened with such great costs. |, at least, am sick to death of them, and have long since begun to hate these useless arguments with Carlstadt and Zwingli, by which, as Paul says [1 Tim. 6:4], the hearts are darkened, and by which one loses all that one knows and becomes a fool. "Thinking themselves wise (he says [Rom. 1, 22.]), they have become fools." But of this verbally a more. 

The disputation on the private mass will take place, God willing, next Saturday [Jan. 29] 3), and the summa of the same is taken in this conclusion: 

All human service in divine things is an abomination. 

But every private mass is of the kind, So every private mass is an abomination. Fare well in the Lord, and come if you can. Given on the day of the conversion of St. Paul [Jan. 25] 1536.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


The Elector rejects Luther's thanks for the gifts sent; expresses himself unfavorably about the fact that the English envoys have spoiled the matter by bickering, and designates Eisenach as the place of the meeting for discussion with Strasbourg and Augsburg. 


The concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 97, No. 41. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 244. 


3) This results in a correction of the time determination for this disputation. All previous editions put it in the year 1535, but that the conclusion given by Luther here is identical with the one given in the St. Louis edition, Vol. XIX, 1298, can be seen at first glance.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have read your letter, which has now been sent to us, and would have been without need of your thanks for the wine and the wild boar, which we have had sent to you, because we are inclined to you with many more gracious gifts. Where the wine also pleased you and tasted good, we granted you with all graces, because we also ordered to send you the best. 

But that you report that the English embassy is delaying things by quarreling and doing little, we would not have provided for that and do not like to hear it, but we do not bear the delay and expense, because we know that they also do such delay of the place for other reasons. 

Since the people of Strasbourg and Augsburg strongly urge you to designate a time and place for the meeting, and you 1) consider such a discussion necessary, we also put up with it and have gladly heard it, because we hope that it will be enough for many good things, and we consider Eisenach to be the most convenient place for it. Therefore, you will know how to name such a place and time according to your opportunity, and when you have united with them in such a place and time, then let us know the same day, and we will provide you with horses, wagons and food to visit such a day. And because you do not consider it useful nor necessary that your many come together, we would like you to take with you the Doctor Pomeranum or Magister Philipp Melanchthon, whom we have hereby appointed for you. In our gracious opinion, we do not want you to do this, and we are inclined to you with all special graces. Date at Torgau, Thursday after Conversionis Pauli [27 Jan.] Anno 1536.

Concerns about the blessedness of mothers who died in childbirth and of stillborn children. 


Manuscript at Gotha in Cod. chart. 402, fol. 168. 4. and at Wolfenbiittel in Cod. Gud.214; also in Aurifaber, vol. Ill. Printed in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 8 and in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 671 f. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1441. 

To the highly venerable man, Mr. Anton Lauterbach, the faithful servant of the church in Leisnig, his extremely dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! "Oh, my Anton, have patience, it will soon be better. On the other hand, about the miscarriages (abortis) and the dying childbed women, these are my thoughts.” First of all, of the childbearing women themselves, if they die in faith, there is no doubt that they will be saved, since they are in the duty of their gender created by God. 


2) "HErr" is missing in the original.

and so faith is found active in its work, even completed in the cross, so that it can safely await the day of judgment or rather of consolation. Therefore, women must be admonished to make the greatest effort to bear the fruit in this emergency, even if they would have to die in childbirth itself. For some care more for their life than for that of the fruit, fearing death or fleeing pain. 

Secondly. As for the fruit that dies either in the womb or in childbirth, this is my opinion: that this sign of God's wrath is not to be despised for the sake of unbelieving and wicked people, who, if they knew that it was of little concern, would do many things that are frightening to think about. Therefore, | would like this misfortune to be made great (but privately) among hard and unintelligent people, in order to deter them from future presumption, of which the world otherwise already has enough, for whose sake God allows such things to happen, whether they want to be frightened. But because such things also commonly happen to the godly (to the seduction and annoyance of the godless), we must think that it is a temptation to our faith. Therefore, if the women are godly, you can comfort them in this way, that they should first of all entrust this matter to the goodness of God, who is much kinder than a man can think. 1) Then he did not bind himself to his sacraments in such a way that he could not do anything else without the sacraments, as under the law he made many (even kings) blessed without the law, namely Job, Naaman, the king of Assyria, Babylon and Egypt. But for this reason he did not want his law to be publicly despised, but rather to be kept under the penalty of cursing. So | hope that for these little ones, who are deprived of baptism through no fault of their own, and since there is no contempt for a public commandment, the kind and exceedingly merciful God will think of something good for them, 


1) The following is inserted in the consolation writings: "Ein schéner, herrlicher Trost flr fromme gottselige Frauen 2c. 1542", inserted. It is missing in the first printing. See Seidemann at De Wette, vol. VI, p.339, also St. Louis edition, vol. X, 733 f.

But which, because of the wickedness of the world, he did not want to proclaim or allow to be believed in general, so that there would not be a contempt for all things that he decrees and commands. For we see that many things are commanded by God for the sake of the wickedness of the world, which He clearly does not regard as anything in godly people. In short, the Spirit works all things for the best; in the wrong-doers He is wrong. 2) Therefore, be careful not to teach this opinion of mine publicly, which belongs only to the consciences of the godly. For the great multitude immediately accept this as a certain law which they can safely follow, and so it will happen that even with knowledge and will they will either kill or neglect the fruit. Therefore, this matter must rather be kept silent publicly, and the good consciences must be comforted privately. For God has not revealed to us what He wants to do with the little ones who have not been baptized, but has reserved them to His mercy, but has commanded that the word and the sacraments be publicly insisted upon; "then we shall leave it at that". He is not unjust. Be well. Greet your flesh, Agnes. 3) 1536, Tuesday after Dorothea [Feb. 8]. Your Martin Luther, D.

"Grace and peace in Christ." Werther, brother in Christ and man of high esteem! | commend to you this bearer of the letter, who tells me that he has been given hope or opportunity to obtain some position at a school with you. Therefore, he has asked me to write to you about it and to recommend him to you. | do this all the more gladly because he has a written certificate from the Count of Hoya in Westphalia, which is issued to me for him, so that he is not to be considered a stranger or suspicious. Therefore, if his work there at the school is necessary for you, do what you can for him. 

There is nothing new, except that | deal with it. To attack with a public writing the Crocodile of Halle, whom | have made a dragon and cardinal of the devil in a private letter to him. 1) Pray that Christ may accomplish what he has begun in him, namely judgment, since he, as one unrepentant to the end, does not cease to pursue the grace of God.

Pommer blessed them (since |, overcome by dizziness, was unable to do so), completely according to our manner, as it is contained in the Catechism, because that is how the prince had wanted it.

To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Lord John Frederick, Duke of Saxony and Elector 2c., Landgrave in Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord with my poor prayer. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! We have humbly heard E. C. F. G.'s order from Magister Francisco, Vice-Chancellor, 3) for the sake of the English 2c.; and the said M. Franciscus will hand over the articles all translated, in which E. C. F. G. will see how far we have got with them here. But since they do not know how their Lord King will accept them, especially the last four, they have therefore taken a step backward to inform His Holiness. Where now His Majesty would accept them, the covenant may have its continuation, for such articles rhyme well with our doctrine; whereupon in time, if they desire it, a message may be made herein to report the king more clearly. But if His Holiness does not want to accept these articles or seek much reflection or change in them, we can certainly not confuse and mislead our churches anew for their sake, which have hardly yet been brought to peace and quiet. 

E. C. F. G. may conclude the king's affairs with marriage from this religious matter, or, if it is considered good, offer to answer for it as far as we have approved it. 

With Duke George's things, ours have acted almost carelessly, so that | was highly moved. But E. C. F. G. have a good conscience and have honestly and Christianly offered to drop all ill will; in this is GOtte

enough, he will not forget it in his time. But that revengeful, unpeaceful man remains as he has always been, bloodthirsty and murderous, until it happens to him according to Psalm VIII [v. 3]: "That you execute the enemy and the revengeful." The best thing is that he cannot pray before such hardened wickedness, with all who cling to him; for he does not need either, so proud is he. But we can pray, praising God, who seek and offer peace and forgiveness; 1) therefore God will also hear us, if we humbly confess our sin and seek His glory.

Grace and peace in Christ 2c. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The time is now approaching Walpurgis, that according to E. C. F. G. prescription Doctor Hieronymus Weller shall receive the 40 fl. on the castle Wartemberg from a fief. Now Er Inst Menius writes that because the same fief is ordered to the Sequestratoribus, he will neither in Eisenach nor in WeiBensee 1) be able to obtain anything on the said prescription, where E. C. F. G. does not give the Sequestratoribus order that they let such fief follow the Schésser or SchultheiBen in Eisenach, and will be, as before the year, messenger's fee and letter for nothing. | have humbly notified E. C. F. G. of this letter with the humble request that they graciously arrange for the 40 fl. to be given to the aforementioned Doctor Hieronymo, or where he should wait for it. Because the sequestratores are scattered, it is difficult to find them or to bring them together, as he also indicates. E. C. F. G. will know how to show gracious counsel in this matter. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. Thursday after Judica [April 6] 1536.

And is that the thing. | have often heard from him how the air and the elements in Kéthen are almost difficult for him, but because he has such a gracious, kind master in E. F. G., he has been persuaded, also by me, to stay until then, whether he would have liked to be in healthy air [beneficial] 1) for his body; for he was brought up and accustomed to fresh air. Now, at last, | talked to him whether it would not be possible, since he could not be in Kéthen,

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Johann Brismann, a true doctor of theology and now an extremely faithful preacher at K6nigsberg, his very dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! Your letters have always been pleasant to me, my dear Brismann; that | have not always answered them, you give yourself the reason for that in your letter, for | am very busy. But the preoccupations are not so much to blame as the messengers, who, either out of prudence or preoccupied by their own affairs, often neglect me, even when | have written. Besides, being already old and more than once seriously ill, | am compelled to refrain from much greater things than writing letters to friends, to whom | have a firm confidence that they will not need this irritant of friendship, but will also, when | am dead, be lively and busy ministers of the doctrine of Christ, among whose number | have always thought you one of the first.

Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray bravely in faith and be vigilant. Surely he does not sleep.

G. and Peace. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, 

Most Gracious Lord! The council of Minden in Wesiphalia have sent their superintendent, Briefs- Zeiger, to E. C. F. G. with writings, and have also asked me in writing to faithfully command their present distress to E. C. F. G. and to ask for gracious counsel. The priests cannot rest, and strengthen themselves by the miserable case at Munster with defiance to eradicate the Evangelion at all other places as well. God will defend them, amen. What now in this E. C. F.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotees and faithful! The reverend, our councilor and dear faithful, Bleikard Sindringer, doctor, reported to us, when he arrived here today in Torgau, among other things, that the matters with you and the preachers of the cities of Upper Austria, who are now in Wittenberg, should proceed in a good and harmonious way, which we graciously and gladly hear, and first of all, that such a thing is undoubtedly conducive to the praise, honor and glory of God the Almighty, as well as to the increase and spread of His holy Word. 

But because the said Doctor Bleikard did not actually know how, in what way and to what extent the reported matters should lead to agreement, and we would like to know such things, our gracious request is that you report and inform us of these things, and also of how you will take and establish a farewell with them, in a beneficial manner and without delay with your own proper messenger to Naumburg, where we are not to be found here in Torgau, by means of writings. You have our favorable opinion, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date Torgau, Thursday Ascensionis Domini [May 25] Anno 1536.

And if this union of ours pleases you and your preachers, as we have done here, you will in time know how to make it known to us, as we in turn want to make it known to you, how it pleases our lords and preachers.

To Margrave George of Brandenburg. 


Condolences on account of the death of his father; of the Ansbach students in Wittenberg; of the settlement negotiations conducted there. 


From the Ansbach Archives in Reinhard's Beitragen, |, 143; in De Wette, vol. IV, p. 694 and in the Erl. Edition, vol. 55, p. 138. 

To the illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Mr. 

Georgen, Margrave of Brandenburg, Duke of Stettin, Pomerania 2c., Opole 2c., and Prince of Rigen 2c. 2c., my gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! | have now received two writings from E. F. G., both graciously written. The first, how E. F. G. Lord father, Margrave Frederick, requires from this world of God 2c., and 


No. 2243, 2244. 2065 


It pleases me sincerely that E. F. G. has shown such faithful filial honor to her Lord Father, that she also wants to ascribe such to me 1) as a small person so graciously and kindly, although E. F. G. also have the glory before (by God's grace) that she has kept highly-named E. F. G. Lord Father in all honors in his F. G. life. 

The other, what the students (whose E. F. G. entertains here a lot) study, | don't know any other way, because it's right; because walking in the streets and screaming at night is, praise God, not special, as it used to be in times past. But if | find one who has behaved in this way, | will certainly paint him E. F. G. very briefly and soon, and call him home, as | have done to some. But what happens secretly, | cannot judge, and it is quite possible that | do not learn everything; everything is ordered publicly with all diligence. 

What is being done here by us, who have come together in matters of the sacrament, will be communicated in writing to E. F. G. after the final action, as will all other princes, lords and preachers who are related to this matter; for without their knowledge and consent, we will and will not conclude anything final, because more is at stake than some might think. But they have already gone so far that they want to keep and teach our Confessio and Apologia faithfully. However, we have negotiated with them about this and in several other articles, so that all danger and cunning would be put aside and a true Concordia would be established; we want to send all this to E.F.G.. Because E. F. G. is one of them in the Confession, they will certainly (like others all) also be present or must know how such a Concordia is decided and made. 

E. F. G. want to do their best to help the preachers, so that the old things are not counted too harshly, and the stupid are not deterred. | trust that they are in earnest; if not, they can easily be punished with the accepted Apologia. And it does not matter if they violate the papists' procession and ciboria.

To the highly esteemed and worthy Mr. Nicolaus von Amsdorf, Licentiate of Theology, his brother who is extremely dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | am sending you, my dear Amsdorf, what we did in our meeting, and at the same time | ask you to communicate this to others, especially to the pastors of larger cities, on whatever occasion you can, and to write your and their judgment about it here, if you can. 

That book of Bibliander or the letters 1) has been published against the will of those who were here, and they are unwilling about it. For the churches of the Swiss are not yet in this matter of concord, although those have good hope and say that the commonwealths and the people are tired and weary of this discord, and wish that a concord be established.

from Luther, as the main person, it may also be "gestellet" by Melanchthon. Corp. Ref, Vol. Ill, 195 also assigns it to Melanchthon alone. But only Hochhuth, Protestant Secten- Geschichte, in Niedners Zeitschrift 1858, 560, has communicated this writing completely. There, at the end of the writing, the following additions are found in Luther's hand, which are printed in Burkhardt, p. 303, note 3. 


And since our gracious Lord Landgrave reports that some leaders and teachers of the Anabaptists are imprisoned, who are to be expelled and have not kept their promise, E. F. G. may in good conscience have the same punished with the sword because they have been disobedient and have not kept their promise or oath. 

This is the common rule. But may our g. Lord may always let mercy go next to punishment according to the opportunity of coincidences.

He wanted to moderate his punishment in such a way that he could sell his possessions and leave the country alive with his wife and child. Now | think it would be better if E. F. G. would let him be punished with the dungeon for a while, and stay with wife and child, with duty, where he would do more of the thing, should have his head neglected straight away. For such boys, when they come to their equals, help to make the fire 1) bigger, and nothing bad can happen to them, than that they are kept in the country and are obliged, as my most gracious lord, the Elector, ordered Carlstadten to do and some more. But E. F. G. will know what all this means, because | myself do not know how to keep these people. If they stay, they don't stop throwing things; if you chase them away, they make it ten times worse. But if this Matthes were serious, that he so humbly surrenders to repentance, it would be better to keep him in the country with duty, than that he desperately causes greater misfortune outside the country.

Grace and peace in Christ! You send, my dear Doctor Jonas, greetings to the Lord Spalatin, because | could not write to him. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me. 1536, Wednesday in Pentecost [June 7]. 

Your Mart. Luther.

But listen to what | had forgotten: your letters seemed to me far too cheerful, and to give off the odor of a righteously enjoyed red wine, although you and Spalatin did not indicate this, and other causes were put forward. | am glad that the hope of harmony is so great, but soon that old man, easily inclined to quarrel and restless, will invent another discord, since, as the salamander lives on fire, so he lives on hatred, strife and disturbance of himself and all. | write little, because yesterday all day | suffered the precursor of the stone, which you with your horror call 2) lead; but since | avoided wine, a number of grains came off, and so | have recovered. | was pleased to hear everything from the landgrave, especially that our prince treated our united or to be united so generously and graciously. My lord Kathe greets you reverently and is pleased that you are cheerful, but she fears that the goodness of the wine may deceive you, that you may accumulate stones through too abundant use of it and bring back kidneys full of them, "as rough and sharp" (these are her words) "from stones as the wine casks are, when they have been drunk", but afterwards you may say that they arise for you here in Wittenberg, although you always sow them elsewhere, which you are forced to give out here and to give back, as Michael Stiefel once said that you sometimes let out a wind outside, but when you come in again to your comrades, you bring the stink with you. You will undoubtedly recognize philosophy, as | also recognized it in Coburg through her 3). Everything in your house is fine. Again, be well.

To the worthy and truly godly man, Mr. M. G. Spalatin, the extremely faithful servant of Christ, his brother who is very dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Werther Spalatin, here comes Kilian Zimmermann, who has either been expelled from Glaucha or has escaped, and has asked that he be helped to some position. But since so many poor people are streaming in from all places, there can of course be no positions left for them. Therefore, he has finally asked that | recommend him to you, and | ask that you take it in such a way that this be done through this letter. For he also belongs to your district, since he lived near Altenburg.

Greet your exceedingly lovely wife and tell her that | think the best and most right of her, and may she bear these motherly (not to say stepmotherly) insults.

1 the highly famous and valuable man, M. Georg Spalatin, the extremely faithful servant of God, his very dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! You have done well, my dear Spalatin, that you have taken pity on this man, Wolfgang Goizel, and have written for him to the most noble prince, and | ask that you continue in this way to let him be commanded to you, as he is worthy and in need of it. | did not want to intercede for him at the same time, so that | would not be a hindrance to your intercession.

In the Weimar Archive, collated copy from 0, p. 508. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 254. 


G. and peace in Christ! Honorable, dear good friends! On account of your writing on the matter of marriage, which you have indicated, it is my judgment that the man who has been the husband of the senseless woman is not at all obliged to marry the woman who has become pregnant by him before the woman dies, because no betrothal has taken place. But there it is. He would be obliged to marry her and bring her back to honor, because she was humiliated by him or made null and void, as the scripture says. 


1) Burkhardt remarks about the situation: Wolf Hahn zu Zwenitz, whose wife had gone mad shortly after the wedding and was wandering, had impregnated a related maid (his brother's granddaughter). He had been drafted by the courts, the captain of Grinhain. The court (on Nov. 5, 1536) spoke out against the marriage; consequently, the conclusion of the marriage and the cohabitation of both was only permitted outside the Churfiirstenthum, despite repeated requests until 1542. 


according to spiritual law. But if you can keep it from your authorities that they suffer such marriage, then my advice is that they should be allowed to remain conjugally with each other. For such a union is not forbidden by God and imperial law, but for the sake of the courage of wicked people such an example is not to be admitted for law, although in the case such may be admitted and tolerated by some after the fact, as has happened here. 2) For if the woman would not be weakened, it should not be tolerated in 3) any way, for the sake of the wild people. But because it is done, one may let it be good, where the authorities want to be satisfied, and may then spare no conscience in it, because it tolerates imperial (law). Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Joh. Forster, Magister and faithful servant of the church at Augsburg, his extremely dear brother.

Since our gospel and doctrine urge in the highest degree that the two offices, secular and ecclesiastical, be well distinguished, and that they not be mixed together, unless great necessity or lack of persons compels it, that is, where there are persons to govern the city hall and city government, and again where there are persons to govern the parish and churches, neither shall interfere with the other in his office, but each shall be commanded to do his own in conscience, as St. Peter teaches. Peter teaches that we are not to be alienorum curatores vel inspectores; as in the beginning such two offices are separated from Christ, and experience too much testifies that there can be no peace where the council or city wants to rule in the church, and the example of the papacy teaches us well: Accordingly, we ask and admonish you, Pastor and Magister Leonhard, good friend, that you hold fast to this in Zwickau, as decided by the articles of visitation and subsequently by the princely decree. For the devil does not celebrate, so flesh and blood is not good, and the people in these perilous times are strange and foolish, many of whom do not seek peace and unity, but lust and thought. Therefore, because there can be neither peace nor unity, where the chaplain, schoolmaster, and church servants know that they may be in the church office without the knowledge and will of the parish priest, and thus can defy and insist on the council, since one can find everywhere 


2080 Letters from the year 1536. 


If you find backholders against the parish priests: You should not set an example and allow them, without your knowledge (where they want to do it) nor will, to accept or tolerate some chaplain, schoolmaster or church servant; just as we here in Wittenberg, according to the visitation, also do not allow the parish priest to accept and take leave without the knowledge and advice of the secular regiment, which also, as far as we know, all other cities do, without where the visitators (since one cannot otherwise get one) are asked for it. The secular regiment has enough to do for itself and must not burden itself with unnecessary regiments. It also has an annoying reputation, and neither Zwickau nor any other city council must not be ashamed to follow the example of Wittenberg and other cities, because according to the visitation order, to deviate from which common orders does not make good thoughts, but finally separation and devastation of the churches. We should thank God that our churches are somewhat brought into equal order and fasted; and God will not give happiness to those who disrupt such order and unity, and for the sake of their own ambition and conceit without any hardship. May God help and strengthen us all in right faith and uncontaminated love, Amen. Monday after St. Magdalene [July 24] Anno Domini 1536.

So | think, if you could raise it with the sons with kindness, so that they would grant it, then it would have its course; but if this cannot be, and the daughters have previously handed over such things, then it cannot weigh down your conscience, where you cannot bring back what they have forgiven.

But in order for you, dear teacher, to get to know the matter better, | will describe it briefly. There is a girl with us, about sixteen years old, who is possessed by the devil in a way that | have never read or heard an example of. For at certain hours she is seized by a rage of Satan, in such a way that she tears out pennies, dimes, and other Mark coins, sometimes from a dress, sometimes from the beard of someone standing there, sometimes from the table: In short, she snatches it from any place, and if someone does not suddenly seize her hand, she puts the money she has seized somewhere into her mouth, chews it up with her teeth, and often shows it on the front of her tongue, which she tends to stick out. At night, however, she makes such a great noise, just as if she were shaking a great treasure with her hands, which she also tries to swallow in bed, so that the danger of 


suffocation is to be feared; one believes it washwitenberg.

Everything she sees, everything she talks about, is either money or a mouse (mus{[sic]), and often she makes a treasure sound, so that one would like to believe it was a great wealth. A certain measuring priest, who was called to us by the wise council from the next little town, wanted to cure her, but he did nothing else 2) than with consecrated herbs, waters, rescues and, if | am not mistaken, with very violent incantations, at last also with threats, until the sixth day; then he finally left, deceived in his hope. 3) Meanwhile,

this rare and dangerous matter, and for the love of hrist, | ask you to come to our aid in this matter. You now this adversary's tricks and weapons, and you also know how to resist him so that he will finally be driven out.

To the highly esteemed man, Mr. Andreas Ebert, preacher at Frankfurt an der Oder, his brother who is very beloved in your Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! To many it seems unbelievable what you write, my dear Andrew, and before you wrote, | also thought, since it was told here, that | was hearing a joke or a fairy tale. But if the matter is as you write, | think it is a sign by which God allows Satan to display the figure and image of certain princes who steal and devour treasures everywhere, and yet accomplish nothing. Now, since this is a jesting spirit, and in its leisure ridicules our safety, we must first pray earnestly for the girl who must suffer these things for our sake. Then this spirit must again be despised and ridiculed, nor must we attack it with any incantations or serious things, because it ridicules all this in devilish hopefulness. But we must persevere with prayer for the girl and with contempt against the devil, and at last, if Christ gives grace, he will desist. It would also be good if the princes improved their vices, which are attacked by this sign, in which this mischievous spirit, as it is indicated here, reigns mightily and surely. | ask you, since this matter is worthy of being published, 1) that you have everything investigated in the most certain way, so that there is no fraud behind it, and especially) whether the coin or the coins that the girl grabs and swallows are real coins, which can suffer the use on the market. For | have been driven by so many false pretenses, deceptions, intrigues, lies, tricks, etc., that it must necessarily be difficult for me to believe everything, unless such things | know | do and say. So great is the power of the devil, the wickedness of the world and the audacity of men today.

My dear Doctor! With joy | have heard and read that you have finally become a man and have obtained flesh to join you.3) For what is either a man without a woman, as Moses speaks, or a woman without a man, especially when you look at the first marriage. For both do not know their gender as long as they are alone. This kind of life was created by God, and so far He has preserved it against all heresies and thoughts of the devil, yes, against the excesses, complaints and impatience of men. May Christ now bless you and your bride, and grant you to dwell sweetly and in love with each other forever, amen. 

With regard to the wedding, | do not yet fully approve of your intention, for you know the inadequacy of our market and all the things from which we still suffer daily, so that neither | nor my Kathe can hope how, with such great difficulty of circumstances, we could dine so large a crowd honorably, and as it should be. And yet | do not want to bring a stain on your and my honor. It seems to me advisable that you either celebrate your wedding at Freiberg, or, if that cannot happen, that you, after having arranged a splendid farewell feast of several tables there, come here in small company, as Kreuziger, Doctor Brick, and others have done, and to a

"Our market is a mess, and if the hemp is to be loaded, the university with all its children, and others who, in my opinion, cannot be left outside, there will be neither 9 nor 12 tables.

Jurists about the Concil tendered to Mantua. (Regest.) 

Pope Paul Ill had announced a conciliar meeting for May 3, 1537. On July 24, the Elector sent the edict of the Pope (see No. 2262) to the scholars at Wittenberg with the request to give their opinion on it. Briick received in a letter, dated Herzberg, July 26, the order to have the objection prepared and delivered within 14 days. This was done. Melanchthon is the author of it. The signatories have already been named in No. 2262.

Christ grant that both you may continue and that we may increase with you in sincere love. And | hope that through you these actions of ours have been made known to all the pastors as much as you could, so that this peace may be strengthened by the unanimous consent of all. We want to pray for this in the same way, and you will also be concerned with us so that the people will also recognize the truthful opinion, and that this harmony will finally be completed, in that the misgivings and doubts of the consciences will cease. | will announce your agreement to all our people, and they will rejoice with us and believe all the more easily that it is a sincere harmony after all suspicion has been removed. May the Lord guide our hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ, amen. Given on August 7, 1536.

To the worthy and godly man, Mr. N. Joh. Férster, the faithful and fair servant of the church at Augsburg, his brother who is exceedingly dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! My Margarethlein (Marussula) thanks you for your gift, my dear forester. | am very surprised that you write that Musculus spoke in such a way that one should incite the magistrate against the canons, while the opposite has been decided and accepted by all of us for certain. But you may act moderately and see whether they want to continue in this way or not; then we will open the whole matter to the council with complaints. In the meantime, it is enough that they themselves admit that the opposite has been decided here, precisely by saying that they have contradicted or opposed this opinion of ours (although it is not true). Therefore they will finally be convicted as people who want discord and a feigned unity. By the way, our opinion was not that what was discussed here should be concealed, rather we asked that it be reported to all churches, pastors and authorities, so that their opinion could be heard about it and indicated to us, only it should not be reported before everyone's opinion was known and before the 





The agreement should be published by the printers, so that an untimely song of triumph would not be sung before the victory and many would cry out that everything was done without their knowledge and ina corner. For | expect the consent of all to be sent to us in writing, as you and your authorities have sent it, so that with public consent a public concord may arise, and the public may be published. 

The other day, a certain woman in Magdeburg put Mr. Nicolaus Amsdorf in a state of unrest, so that he has very little hope of the sincerity of the agreement. | believe that you know the farthest fei, namely the wife of Doctor Cubito, "the Hummelsheim of Leipzig". She had told Amsdorf many and great things about your "Master Michel" 1) against us and our opinion 2c. "It does not make good blood, if they do not want to stop." | still bear everything patiently, and did not want to report to your council so soon, until the cry would be greater.

Now that it concerns your honor, you may consult with your friends whether you want to have a meal here in the evening or the wedding. | understand something different by the [wedding] banquet than by the wedding. For if you want to celebrate the wedding here, then you must mean what moved me before to advise you, namely that Wittenberg is the university, that it is a famous place, that you are a doctor, that | am the host, therefore necessarily many must be invited who otherwise could be passed over with honor if the wedding were to take place in another place, for consideration must be given both to the city and to the academy, then also to your and my honor. | therefore send the register, from which you can see how large a number must be invited (although some will be cancelled).

If your honor and that of your friends is to remain unharmed, especially since your very honorable friends must be served with some pomp, which the present difficult time conditions do not permit. "With 100 fl. you can hardly do it, because to hold a wedding is something different than to attain the doctorate (Doctoratus). But it is best that either you or your brother come here, so that we can discuss this matter as soon as possible. For by letters and messengers one cannot come to a decision, and in the meantime time is running out. Therefore, send thyself so that the matter may become certain. "For it would not seem that we would do dishonor." Summa, soon either you yourself may come, or someone in your name, so that we are not unprepared. For | am troubled by the thought of your honor and my name; otherwise, if you do not come or send someone, | cannot and will not do anything in this matter alone, because | am very concerned about you, as | have always been.

Because the worthy Kunegundis von Byern, sth. our dear Domina, on Tuesday after Quasimodogeniti [25. April], we have been addressed by the worthy and honorable Johann Talnorden, provost, and Andresen Célen, co-commanders of our monastery Plétzka (Ploczka), by written order received, and severely admonished to have all the monastery's letters, privileges and justice inventoried; and although we before the same time quite diligently requested from the said provost and co-commandant that they would most beneficially help to decree [that] we again within a month's time, as was done before after the expiration of each domina, also choose another domina, which they promised us to promote and present with diligence. Thereupon we were also willing, according to her desire and received order, to submit letters and privileges and have them inventoried. However, after we found that she was negligent in promoting what the mention concerned, and that we, without head or commander, would hardly have been able to resist in many ways, as E. A. W., as a man of high understanding, easily to measure, has lived up to now, because the youngest wants to be obeyed as soon as 1) that the youngest, according to respectable understanding, should obey the eldest, as it must be in assemblies and in all places where there is no head or commander. Now our poor children (as the desolate in this world) are not of the opinion that we therefore desire to elect a Domina, that some popery should thereby be raised among us again, especially after an order has been issued by the worthy, highly esteemed lords visitators, concerning the church customs, especially after an order has been issued by the worthy, highly esteemed lords visitators concerning the church customs, chants and administration of the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, our only Redeemer and Savior, without any of our poor sinners' works or additions, we have so far, by divine grant, always been obedient and obedient as much as possible, as we hope the ordained pastors will therefore not give us any other testimony. 2) However, after the above-mentioned visitators and electoral commanders there have again promised us that we will leave the papists and accept their order, which is in accordance with the holy word of God, and that we will continue to follow them.

Here is the parish priest of Hildburghausen M. Johannes Weybringer 1) 2c., recently deposed from the parish with great dishonor and dishonor, as E. C. F. G. may understand from his report, and the superintendent and some others write to me that everything was done and founded out of envy and hatred, as it seems to me myself, and the people of Hildburghausen are also crying out that they may not have a parish priest for long nor suffer 2c. So my humble request is that E. C. F. G. demand a diligent report and testimony from the entire council and citizens, what they think or know about their pastor, or where it should or can be demanded; and what is found to be just, let 2) E. C. F. G. confidently go. For it is true that we preachers are not pious either; but because everyone is hostile to us, St. Paul teaches (perhaps also wittily) that one should not allow everyone's complaint against the preachers. He has been an honest, pious man until now, we all know that here; should he now suddenly have changed? | hope not. So there is no proof, but only some signs of suspicion, which could be widespread and | could encounter them myself. There would be something more behind it. E. C. F. G. wanted to consider that without this, there would be few people available for church service; if these should now also be rejected with injustice and disgrace, it would deter much. But if they are wronged, they shall suffer it much more than all others. E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously observe this. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen.

Grace and peace in Christ! That the Bull of St. Paul, 3) that is, of the Cardinals, has not been handed over to me, is perhaps due to the fact that M. Philip first received it from Bernard at his request, and he has not yet shown it to me (as there is a mutual trust or neglect among us). For so | care to do with his letters. But the German one, which is printed here, | saw yesterday; | saw and also recognized, not the cardinal virtues, of which Seneca and other philosophers teach, but the cardinals, the supports (cardines), the captains, indeed the heads of Satau himself.

| would like to recommend it to you, perhaps moved by some hope that they will receive some help either through my letter or through the promises of those. They have come here poor and exiled, cast out for the sake of the gospel. If this is true, as it seems to be, | am very surprised that people belonging to such a large family come here. For you know the bishop of Liége sufficiently, and the name of his brother, Rupert of Aremberg (Anborch) (whom the king of France also calls Lord de la Marcha in the recently published accusation against the emperor), is sufficiently known to me. The woman, who is ignorant of our language, seems to be with us as with Scythians. Therefore, you will take pains to recommend her to the citizens already mentioned. And this Carl, the Frenchman (Carolus Gallus), who served with that Nicolaus Claudianus in my house, who testifies that he knows everything and that it is true. But you know how we are overwhelmed with strangers here. Since you left, | have taken care of several monks who left, one of whom, after | had paid a pretio to a craftsman for him, escaped from me again because of "mischief on my neck". 

Doctor Hieronymus Weller married a virgin from Freiberg, the daughter of "G. am Steige". My Kathe thinks that you know her father. You will be at the wedding or at the little banquet, but it is impossible for me to do what he is putting me through if it is not tempered.

The original concept, with many corrections, is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. Kk, pag. 135. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 263. 

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have read your letter concerning the virgins in the monastery at Plétzka, and also the writing of the virgins mentioned, in which they also report the fatal departure of their previous Domina, and ask that they be encouraged to receive 1) another Domina, for the sake of external regiment and order, and not contrary to 2) the divine word, to be allowed to choose among them. And although we do not understand such a search of theirs other than that it is based on 3) indicated causes, so that they may want to maintain good discipline and order in their external being with one another, we nevertheless consider, where a choice is thus permitted in their previous manner, that it would make an introduction to us in other places and give rise to annoyance (pirate). However, in order that the nuns in the above-mentioned monastery may maintain proper external order and virginal discipline, we request that you, as yourselves, give them advice and indicate: If all of them or the greater part of them would indicate to us or to you a brave and for this purpose suitable and skilful person, who would have a reputation among them before the others, then we would give her an open written order and mandate, and order her to maintain the government, order and obedience among the nuns, order and obedience among the monastics and virgins, and also to maintain the same among them, and to inflict considerable punishment, provided that 4) you also consider that such lay life should be established and confirmed according to the previous old way and order. In your gracious opinion, we do not want you to do this. Given at Torgau, Saturday after Assumption of the Virgin Mary [Aug. 9], Anno 1536. 


(Wittenberg.) No. 2289. August 22, 1536. To Franz Burkhard, Vice Chancellor of Saxony. 


Luther asks if he may dare to intercede with the Elector for a mad widow. 


From the Schmid collection at Helmstadt in Schitze, Vol. III, p. 19 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 19. 


1) Burkhardt: "would like". 

2) Burkhardt: "the". 

3) So put by us instead of: "nit anderst derselb". 4) Burkhardt: "so ferner". 


To the highly famous man, Mr. Franz Burkhard, the Vice-Chancellor of Saxony, his special friend in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! My dear Vice- Chancellor Franz, | ask you to find out whether | can successfully intercede for the insane old woman, "the cross-binder". Her daughter here cries piteously, and it is nothing new that she is used to rage like that, which the licentiate Blank can also testify to, as her neighbor. We often laughed at Dell because he quarreled with her through the intervening fence until they became enraged against each other and she chased him off with a large spear. And it is no great praise when the prince punishes this insane (male sanam) woman (especially a widow) so severely, who thinks the whole town is insane; she was also once driven out of Halle, almost for the same reason. "She is a fool, you must report her to my most gracious lord on my faith; and when she has been punished enough, my most gracious lord will do well to let her go; she will neither become wiser nor better thereby. Some consideration must also be given to the virgin, her daughter, whom the raging of the mutant has harmed enough, since she is a completely grown-up girl and even sensible, so that | myself wish her a worthy husband. But through these evils (calamitatibus), which affect her mother as well as her, those who might marry her are more and more alienated from her; "it is" the misery of men chained together, but still mercy must break the fetters. Therefore, let me know if it is time for me to intercede for her, and | will do so; for it grieves me, not the mother nor the son-in-law, but the daughter, because she is in need of mercy. Fare well in the Lord. On Tuesday after Agapitus [Aug. 22] 1536. Yours, Martin Luther, D. 


Dessau. No. 2281. August 24, 1536. George, Prince of Anhalt, to Luther. (Regest.) 


The fact that the case of Antonius Schénitz is behind schedule is not the fault of the Cardinal of Mainz, nor is it his own fault, because he was prevented by illness and other postponements.

It is not the case that the matter has been prevented by the other business, but rather by Antonius Schénitz himself, who has rejected the place of negotiation that he himself had indicated. 1) Now Luther may work with Sch6nitz so that the matter is not held up by choosing a new venue. He, the prince, will spare no effort to ensure that the matter reaches a good conclusion.

To the most illustrious and illustrious true Prince and Lord, Lord George, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien, Lord of Bernburg, Provost of the Church at Magdeburg, his most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have never doubted 

in the least the loyalty of E. F. G., noble Prince, therefore it was not necessary for E. F. G. to apologize so carefully, but | must always hold that extremely bad man suspicious because of many things that | know for sure, not from Schénitz, but from Rome and the Roman world. And | fear only this for our Germany, that you princes may begin to sigh too late and to mourn over your security; for it is the secret of wickedness that we do not want to become wise before we have experienced the damage. If it is possible, | beg that E. F. G. will not trust this monster. "But if it shall not be, let (it) go as it may." We have here no lasting city (civitatem), only that | also wish peace and well-being to this Egypt and Babylon (in which we are prisoners). "But E. F. G. will graciously grant it to me": | cannot believe, nor even entertain the suspicion, that this man is acting or saying anything in earnest. For this reason, | very much wish that E. F. G. were free from this monster, "God knows that. E. F. G. look forward", 


1) Thus, instead of "aufschlecht," Burkhardt reads. 


as God will give. Therefore, for the sake of the petitions of all of us, | gladly, but with fear, place myself at E. F. G.'s service, but "God make it better than we think, amen. For the devil always makes it worse than we think. Herewith amen. Mondays after St. Bartholomew" (28 Aug.) 1536.

Joachim Badian to Luther. (Regest.) 

In order to counteract the agitation in the Swiss church, he had written a paper last winter, which he had published at the request of friends who expected good things from it for the establishment of harmony. To his joy he had seen that the Concordia, which had been concluded in the meantime, was in complete agreement with what he himself had taught long ago. Nevertheless, in order to avoid possible slander, he sent Luther his book and again briefly explained his point of view on the question of the Lord's Supper, with the request that, after reviewing his work, he be informed by letter of any objectionable passages.

Let us try it with another one; for | have asked Mr. Antonium, and admonished him most strongly, that he should leave and go away, which he then agrees to do; and we will know how to use him here, for such stones will not be found on all streets. And because the priest does not like it, he will probably find a gap that is just for him. You want to make sure that the trouble that has arisen from the discord between the two will not be suffered at last, so help them to get away from each other. Hiemit GOtt commanded, Amen. Ultima 


Augusti 1536. Martinus Luther, D. No. 2284. Strasbourg. September 4, 1536. Capito to Luther. (Regest.) 


Capito fears that the letters he wrote to Luther earlier, since his departure from Wittenberg, are lost, so he tells again what happened in the Concordia matter. Of the reluctance of Abbot Volsius and the futile attempts to induce him to change his mind, in which the machinations of Schwenkfeld and comrades must have been at play. Of the reasons for the delay of the signature. The Swabian cities, with the exception of Ulm, have declared themselves in favor. He sends a letter from Basel, where there will be a convention before Michaelmas. To Augsburg, where the papists boast that jurisdiction has been restored to them, a request has been made to avoid urging the magistrate to abolish the mass immediately, and Capito has been asked by a member of the Augsburg magistrate's office to ask Luther not to announce anything about the question of jurisdiction there. His opinion on this 2c.

Bucer to Luther. (Regest.) 

Bucer reports in detail about the negotiations concerning the acceptance of the Concordia. In response to an invitation to Basel to sign, they sent Grynaus and Carlstadt to Strasbourg to obtain further information; they then continued to negotiate with Zurich and Bern. Contrary to expectations, a new meeting of the Swiss was announced from Basel for Sept. 24. On hearing that Augsburg had independently sent in its signature, Strasbourg had exhorted the allied cities to speed up matters, but had not yet received a reply. Schwenkfeld seems to be partly to blame for the delay. Urgent request to Luther to withhold the decision on the jurisdiction of the magistrates in Reformation matters, since the papists, who had received word of it, were triumphant because they thought they could thereby reestablish their idolatries. About the book of Vadian, whose letter he sends along. He hopes to be able to send the signatures soon.

Nicholas von Amsdorf to Luther. 


About Melanchthon's doctrinal deviations, which then led to the dispute with Conrad Cordatus.

Behold, my venerable Father in Christ, the judgment of D. Tridensis and the writings that Aepinus sent me, to which he refers, as he himself writes, that they will soon be read by the Wittenbergers. While Philip is absent, | send them to you. Here it is said that at Wittenberg contradictory things are taught. The one in the school insists fiercely and beyond measure that works are necessary for eternal life, but you, in the same week and on Sunday in church, according to your godly spirit, have taught about regeneration: a child in its mother's womb does nothing or works nothing, but only suffers and is formed 2c. This troubles our people very much and certainly also troubles me. Our adversaries in this city take courage against us and make trouble and work for me, because this fact itself persuades the people that they must return to their godless teachings and leave the gospel. Here | need your advice, and ask, and ask again for the same. Here the rumor has arrived that the pope has become a Lutheran because he preaches twice a week, and so do some cardinals. But these are trivial things. "The devil is too strong there, he does not let them, together with his own, come so much." The Bishop of Cologne, with his head covered with berries and a beard, dressed as a hunter, soon comes as a cavalryman to visit the Margrave in Berlin. What this is all about, | do not know.

To the highly gifted man, Mr. Nicolaus Hausmann, servant of Christ in the church at Dessau, his extremely dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | seldom write to you, best Nicolaus, because | thought there was nothing, since all our news is always very well known to you, and your court learns the news sooner than ours. Both Margraves 1) have turned away from the Gospel; if you do not know this yet, you shall know it now, and | do not know what kind of evil is breaking out among us here. | will tell you my new advice about you. For | am anxious to call you away from there and make you my housemate, so that you can finally enjoy peace and quiet. | already have the promise of your brother that he wants to keep you here with me. For | see that this place is not for you. 

D. Hieronymus Weller is cheerful; he has moved away from me to a house neighboring mine, which | was glad to see.

From England our Alesius writes here that the new Queen Joan 1) is to be crowned on Michaelmas, an enemy of the Gospel, as he says, and the shape of the kingdom is now different, so that Antony must be hidden and silent and is not without danger. Nevertheless, the king persists in rejecting the pope, and it has been decided with the consent of the whole kingdom that no one should travel to the Concilium unless the king has previously consented to the Concilium, which will never happen.

Since he now answers me that he wanted to stay with jurisprudence, my intercession remained with you, as | then answered his friend, the Schésser. Because | do not want, 


1) The letter is dated "Sunday after St. Marcus. Burkhardt considers Marcos to be a reading error and conjicirt Michaelis, therefore comes to Oct. 1. But "Marcus" is to be taken here with Seidemann as "Marcus nach St. Francisci" (Lauterbach, Vorrede, p.XIV. Cf. St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. XV, 2413). 





Thus | have consecrated the preacher from me. But because he is nevertheless (as | hear) skilled in jurisprudence, for which M. Philipps is also said to have advised him: so you, the council, could well dare to pay him so much for a year, as he is not only your city child, but will also be well needed, especially because the times will dwindle so much that skilled people will be needed. Therefore, | will also have asked for such things for him quite kindly. 

But because | notice from your writing that you want to give the three another year's scholarship at M. Philip's request, but have appointed another boy instead of Gerard, which | cannot disapprove of; but because the same Gerard is almost pious, skilful, and slow to come to the studio, and still needs at least a year's help, | now also ask, if you have M. Philip's honor, to give the three another year's scholarship. Philippo in honor of the three of you, will you also grant me this request favorably, and leave Gerard the scholarship for another year, and it should be the same scholarship for the preacher, who has now become a lawyer. There are so many good people asking for Gerard that | could not refuse. | hope that you will also know how to show yourselves favorably. Hiemit GOtt commanded, Amen.

Again, | want to behave in such a way that you should say that | am grateful and mindful of it. As for the appointment, | limit myself to the fact that | will be in your power: therefore, whatever advice you will give, whatever you will command, that | will carry out.

If itis convenient, you may report this to the most noble prince, my most gracious lord. | will not deceive your good opinion; only you may, since the matter is already beginning, write once to Count Albrecht that you have only seconded me to Eisleben for a time, not sold me, and that you have full right to reclaim me if the benefit requires it.

To the worthy Lord in Christ, Caspar Hubern, the faithful servant of the Word of the Church at Augsburg, my beloved brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | am writing, and yet | 

am very burdened with business, my beloved Caspar in the Lord; in addition, | am also old and almost dead, and | am hardly fit for half the day. Therefore, if some wish to know my thoughts and opinion, you may inform them. | can see how hard the Concordia is proceeding, but because they are acting faithfully, there is still good hope that God, who has begun his work, will also complete it. For he knows the ordained course of his church, namely that the chariot and the horses go through the mud of great waters, and yet the chariot retains the victory, as Habakkuk the prophet indicates. Therefore, let us hope and pray that God the Lord will crush the head of the serpent under our feet, amen. Furthermore, for the sake of the canons, my opinion is not bad, that neither they nor their abominations should be spared, but even though a head does not attack them with action and force, the preachers should by no means remain silent, but should punish their worship and being with a joyful spirit and powerful sermon, and that the same should be done.

But if one wants to worry that the cathedrals will be reserved for the emperor, one can easily find advice for this in the meantime. For this is not to be feared, that the princes will let all such ecclesiastical goods be appropriated to the emperor. They will also want to say in the Ausburt 1) and not unreasonably, if it should ever come to that. In addition, the cities will also find approval. 2) But for the sake of peace, let such idolatrous houses use their great wisdom.

Conrad Cordatus to Luther. 


With reference to a sermon by Bugenhagen, in which he had said that at the University of Wittenberg there was no discord in the matter of good works, but only a dispute over words, Cordatus testified that the dispute touched the matter most deeply. 


From a copy in the library at Wolfenbittel, 11. 10. Aug fol. 610, printed by Kolde, Analecta, p. 270. - The text is immensely flawed: not only two blunders made by Cordatus himself, but a large number of incorrect and meaningless punctuation marks, which make it difficult to understand, so that at first the translation seemed almost impossible. We had to make about 30 changes. 


(Another letter to Doctor Mart. Luth. because of the words which D. Joh. Pom. Bug. had preached on November 8 [sic].) 


Grace from God through Christ! Although, venerable father, | had already been given an occasion to write to you a fortnight ago, by a certain man, who at that time (and perhaps even now) claimed: about the causa sine qua non 2) one may dispute, but | believed that | had to fear what he said: do not go too far! (ne quid nimis!) But since this week someone who seemed to be hostile to this causa sine qua _ non said publicly in the pulpit that there are certain people who think that there are divisions in this school, although there is no discord at all about the things, but only about the words, | thought it was necessary,

that | write this to you, so that you, venerable father, 3) do not in any way agree with the opinion of those people who are merciful beyond measure in matters of faith, while we should be merciful to our neighbor out of love, and just and unyielding in faith. Furthermore, if in contradicting Cruciger | had to go on to others who seem to be favorable to the causa sine qua non, | would certainly also counter that preacher: whether a discord in words would not be a discord that divided the whole body into parts? Then | would ask him what those expressions (termini) were which are only words (termini) without designating things? Let him then speak of the chimera, the buck deer 4) and similar monstrosities in words, as then also the void causa sine qua non is, which the godless 5) sophists first invented out of their vain heads, in that they likewise invent the expressions and the things (like that one his golden calves) out of their heads, and none of the grammarians, whom one must follow in speaking, has ever spoken so. Nor will | myself for the time being believe as true that a dichotomy in such words is not a harmful dichotomy. And was there not among the nominalists and realists a very great and harmful discord? Then they also cry out: One may dispute! Are they not preparing to fight for their discord, which exists only in words 7)? But how beautiful it is that they want to defend their expressions invented against grammar (yes, the things of the expressions themselves) by their grammarians! The final clause (connexionem) of their syllogisms they will answer us on the word of God, which we will confidently oppose them with the help of Christ and his Spirit 8) and with words that are put together without art. But what will those things answer sine qua non, if we hold up these words of Christ [John 14:26]: "The Spirit will remind you of all that | have taught you"? Or did Christ somewhere speak of the thing sine qua non?

But, that | may cease to trouble you with my writing, | say: that those and similar expressions be accursed and remain accursed in the theology of Christ, Amen. 

And whoever claims that those do not cause discord in things, let him see what he brings, or believe also those fabricators (fabris) of new words. 

Fare well and be strong in the Lord and in the power of his strength, that you stand and do not let yourself be moved in any way by anyone, and you, venerable father, know what would have followed if you alone could have been distracted in the cause of the Sacramentans.

Wittenberg. November 5, 1536. To the Elders of the Moravian Brethren. 


Luther agrees with the writings sent by them except for two points: the refusal of absolution for those who have postponed repentance until the last moment, and the maintenance of celibacy, and expresses his willingness to write a preface to their writing if they change the two points. He thanks them for the gift of twelve Bohemian knives. 


From the copy in Lasicki, lib. IV, §13 printed in Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 46. German in Fontes rerum aust. XIX, 24. 


To the men to be revered in Christ, the elders of the Church of the Brethren in Moravia, to his brethren who are most dear in Christ. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! We have, most esteemed men, read your writings and heard the messengers sent to us. We approve of everything very much, except for the only chapter in which you teach that nowhere should such a one be absolved by the church servant who postpones repentance for an evil-doing life until the last breath. Since this Opinion is contrary to ours, it has seemed good to us to remind you of this matter, that you should not do this. 





or at least explain it better, so that after we have seen your good will, we can write a suitable preface to it. Another is about celibacy, although | am not at all opposed to you in this, if you can only have such people who earn their living with their own hands and, as they want to be without marriage, can also remain so, where you will see to it that this rule (Canon) does not entrap other church servants who cannot bear a celibate life. You will certainly learn more about this from these brothers sent to me. As for us, we wish only that, by God's grace, a sincere harmony be established among us, and we want, no less than you, to pray to God that this may continue happily for both of us. Your gift was pleasant to me, but it would not have been necessary for your poverty to be so generous to me. What is left now: May God be the guardian of your bodies as well as of your souls, and may He show His mercy to you abundantly, amen.

To the illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Lord Heinrich, Duke of Mecklenburg 2c., and of the lands [Rostock and Stargard] lord, my gracious lord. 

G. and F. in Christ. Sublime, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! Matthaus Roloff, E. F. G. country child from Quassow 1) has asked me to write to E. F. G. that after he has been in the studio here for some time and has started commendably and has increased well, that there is every hope that he will become a skilful, useful man to be used in E. F. G.'s lands, E. F. G. wanted him to be used for some time. F. G.'s lands, E. F. G. would graciously keep him for several years with a settled fief or stipend. For without this, he can no longer support himself here, and would therefore have to leave the studio out of poverty, which would be a pity, because he has come so far. Thus, E. F. G. himself knows how highly necessary it is that people be educated who are suitable for church offices, for which kings and princes have done so much in the past and donated so much. Is therefore my humble request that E. F. G. would have the aforementioned Matthew in gracious command, for he has inherited, in E. F. G. lands (where he has been born), the church. F. G. lands (where he is needed) to serve again. The F. F. G. will know how to show themselves Christian and gracious in this. Herewith GOtte commanded, Amen.

To the honorable, noble and wise lords, mayors and council of the city of Nuremberg, our favorable lords and friends. 


Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Honorable, wise, favorable gentlemen! We have received Your Honorable Wisdom's writing together with Osiander's sermon and the enclosed questions, 1) on which you desire our concern, and would have been well inclined to ascribe an answer to E. E. W. with this messenger. However, this time we have been so burdened with our most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony's, business that the answers to E. E. W.'s questions could not have been made in this hurry, since the business is important and time is needed to talk about it according to necessity. For although we also maintain the private absoluteness with all seriousness and consider it very useful, and have always taught that for many reasons it should be prevented from being stopped or extinguished in the church, we nevertheless conclude that forgiveness of sins is not obtained through the private absoluteness alone, but also when the heart receives right faith and comfort from common preaching. For preaching and absoluteness have power because God promised to work with His word, whether it be spoken in common or otherwise; item commanded to believe the gospel, whether it be spoken in common or otherwise. On this article stands the summa and the reason of this dispute, and we have this article thus

W. send our concern by own message. E. W. our concern by our own message. God graciously preserve E. E. W. and grant your church peace and unity in Christ.

Conrad Cordatus to Luther. 


A very vehement letter from Cordatus, in which he complains that the faculty at Wittenberg is silent about his cause, while the students are talking about it in the streets. He asks Luthern to write to him about the state of the matter, since he is decan fei. If this does not happen, he will not mass until it becomes clear whether people in Wittenberg still unanimously hold to the Augsburg Confession and whether Melanchthon's /oci have been revoked. 


From a copy in the library at WolfenbUttel, 60c1.10.11. col. 612, printed by Kolde, The text of this letter is also very poor, similar to that of No. 2307. 


To the utmost 1) to D. Martin Luther. Grace to God the Father through Christ! The more | deal with you, venerable Father, with 


1) This is how we have had to translate, since ultime is written, not: ultimo. 





The more | write and speak about this matter, the more | am tormented and frightened in my mind and conscience, because with you and the college of theologians, to whom | have appealed, this foolish causa sine qua non seems to be silent. But with others, even in the alleys, it cries out. For the students, turning one to the other, say: Without me, indeed, justification cannot take place, for it is necessary that he be who is to be justified. And just as, if Peter had not been, Peter would not have been justified, so it is clear that man is some cause of his justification. And these eloquent men, who have never seen even One Book of Augustine, attract this word of Augustine: "who created you without you" 2c. In this one can truly see the work of Satan. For when did we ever hear those people, who were fond of languages, discussing the article of justification, 2) at the time when the same was taught unanimously and purely in the former, and indeed many, years? But now that they have become speakers through the words of Philip and without things (sine rebus), they want to be theologians without things and also with words, and this as far more learned people than others. Therefore they think that they speak with necessity about the causa sine qua non, and ina more appropriate way than anyone before, and praise it to the highest. What is it to wonder that he [Melanchthon] preferred to fight for the instructors 3) of such people and youthful talents than to be instructed, to learn or to believe! Therefore, as far as 4) my matter is concerned, there seems to be nothing left but that | ask you for Christ's sake that you now inform me in writing what the state of this matter now is, and this | now ask of you in the name of the College of Theologians, of which you are the dean, with whom | have now so often acted and asked this matter, and have demanded a just and due end. For | have not complained about this matter to you as to a private person, from the time when D. Creuciger allowed this of his own free will, but | have acted with you as with the college of all theologians, who at present at Wittenberg are unanimous confessors.

and teachers of the article of justification, and that not in the corner, or with the table companions, or only with their assistants (arrisores), but also before God and all men. Furthermore, if you think that it is not necessary for you to write, | will indeed continue on the way | have begun, and what | have hitherto done privately with all those who are concerned about it, 1) | will do afterwards in every way and by every means that | can, so that the truth of faith 2) may remain true and certain. And even that will not deter me if you all say that | am too small to be able or to attack this discord of yours, and much too small to be able to settle it, because you hold and say about me with full truth what | myself hold about myself in my heart; but | know that once an ass spoke, because only a man was about to speak evil to the detriment of God's people, and there was no one else who would have objected to it. Yes, God, who urged me to this single lecture in theology, 4) governs this matter of mine, and for that reason it is also progressing slowly. But | will not rest, and will contradict all those matter-mongers 5) to the last, who give themselves away, according to the measure of my faith, which | have through the Spirit of Christ (if | cannot do otherwise), and will not desist until Christ is publicly glorified as before by the preaching of faith, that that causa sine qua non is done away with from the article of justification, from the article of justification, | say; Otherwise they may say and write about it 6) as eloquently as they are able; for it denies Christ, or at least makes the blessedness which 7) is through Christ ambiguous, that is, nullifies it (nu/lam facif). And so, at last, many hearts will be revealed, and it will come to light whether all Wittenbergers unanimously, without 8) the intrigues of philosophy, rhetoric, and

of sophistry, that faith alone justifies what you seemed to assert at Augsburg 9) without this causa sine qua non, and indeed without any other distinction, and it will become apparent whether that confession is still true among all of you today; likewise, whether the loci have been revoked (which Erasmus seems to have written), which were published by Mr. Philip several times before this year. All this and also other things, which | like to pass over, will undoubtedly be revealed by that causa sine qua non. This [causa sine qua non] is an evil cancer, and words by which 10) are diverted to idle talk and many questions, by those who are too secure in their faith, and have come to fall in the edification of God, which is done by faith. Finally, | also add this to D. Creuciger: If it may be too much 11) or nothing, | will let myself be placed in the midst of all those who do theology in a godly way, and in the face of D. Creuciger | will make a new accusation, and a very short one at that, because in no way must that cancer be allowed to creep further into the healthy flesh of Christ. Fare well, my venerable father, and approve this perhaps useless talk of mine (vel lanam caprinam), which | present to you and to the other true theologians out of my faith, or if truth requires otherwise, reject it without delay, so that the verdict may most certainly be victorious.

Our greeting before. Venerable, worthy and highly learned, dear devotees and faithful! After [we] had been in Wittenberg a few days ago, and had had [our] remonstrance of the advertised and future Con{cilii halben] done to you, whereupon you have [sent] us a [concern] about some of the articles that have been held up, which we have read out and noted to our gracious liking. Because the [article] of Christian doctrine and religion [half a little] far, and in which articles and pieces of peace and unity might or might not be to yield and yield, is still to be put, our gracious request is that you, Doctor Martinus, take the same points and articles before the hand, and put your concern everywhere, what and how far, that it is to be answered for against God and to yield and yield with a good conscience for the sake of Christian love for the preservation of peace and unity in Christendom, also on what [towards the adversaries] 1) finally it is to be based and to persevere or not, and if you make such, then you want to consider the same placed articles altogether and especially, also Licentiaten Amsdorf, Magister Eisleben and some others from our and our friendly dear brother, Duke John Ernest of Saxony, princely preachers and scholars of the Holy Scriptures, according to your concern, by virtue of this order, to join you at our expense, and unanimously agree to the same, and in such case each of you sign with [you]. [If, however, in one or more of the articles you do not think it desirable for you to agree, let him put his objection in writing.

Cordatus informs Luther that he wants to take his matter out of Luther's hands and place it in the hands of the Rector, thereby making the hitherto private matter a public one.

Concerns about the Concil tendered to Mantua, and of the opposition. 


This concern consists of two parts; the first deals with the Concilium at Mantua, the other with the counter-defense. It is taken in its entirety from a copy in Cod. Galli |, p. 115, printed in Corp. Ref., vol. Ill, 126. The second part alone is found in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, p. 220b; in the Jena edition (1568), vol. VII, p. 280b; in the Altenburg edition, vol. VII, p.305; in the Leipzig, vol. XXI, p. 304; in Walch, vol. X, 662; in the Erlangen, vol. 64, p. 270 and in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, 562. - We insert here the first part after the Corp. Ref. 

If the pope or the council cites this part in particular ad respondendum or ad audiendum declarari 2c., then this matter can be dealt with much more conveniently, as it was previously discussed in the same case: whether the citation or with what protestation such citations are to be accepted. And if one considers the proceedings of the Concilii at Costenz and the like, it can be assumed that the Concilium would undoubtedly cite the prelates, even if one did not cite the princes. 

But if this citation goes or not, we consider in all ways that it is useful and necessary to send a message to the Emperor and all potentates, and also to let it go out publicly, in which we indicate as much as possible the opportunity for these important and high things, and ask that they 


3) In the editions this concern is dated (according to Bretschneider) August 20 to 30, but with the reservation that it may also belong to December. Since now in the source of the same, the Cod. Galli, the title is: "Der andere Rathschlag 1536", also in the letter of the Elector from Dec. 11 (No. 2320) Amsdorf is required as a co-counselor in this matter, who also co-signed, furthermore the Elector was personally in Wittenberg at the beginning of Dec. (Corp. Ref., Ill, 126), so we do not doubt that this concern is the answer to the letter just mentioned. Burkhardt, p. 264, also places it in this time.

| would like to think of ways to ensure that a proper trial is carried out, which may serve Christianity for proper Christian unity, as the forma literarum may be considered in the easiest possible way. 

And so a forma is set up, that the same is held up to the fellow relatives, and on the concerns of all states is improved and brought to light in the most beneficial way. Nor shall there be any lack of us; with God's help and by the command of our most gracious Lord, we also want to do our part. For be it as it may, it is useful to be prepared and equipped for it. 

Whether or not to send a special message to the Concilium in this case, we believe, can be determined in time, although we believe, if the Concilium is concerned, that it will be necessary to send a message for the sake of protest. 

Our concern about the counterconcilium is that it should not be hurried in all ways. For to make a counterconcilium has a great terrible appearance, to cause a schism, and that one wants to set oneself against the whole world, no less than if one wanted to go to the field. Therefore, such a great apparent opposition should not be made until one intends to do something publicly with it. There must also first be an understanding among all the estates that they will come together in unity. For if we were to disagree with one another, it would not only be a mockery, but also a great disruption among ourselves and a deterrent to other countries that might otherwise have good will toward us. In this case, it will be necessary to send letters, namely, common notices, in which the cause of the attraction is indicated, item, a warning, why men and other principalities and countries should not help against us, so that no one will be guilty of Christian innocent blood. Item, that they do not help to strengthen unrighteous worship and public sins of the priests. Item, one must offer to help the world, if things are disputed, in which the common man is mistaken and doubtful, that we want to think of ways to bring these inequalities into right consistent, thorough and Christian unity. We must then be prepared with such and suchlike tenders, not to speak of them at present, and also

(Wittenberg.) December 25, 1536. To Prince Joachim of Anhalt. 


Luther comforts him in his melancholy. 


From Beckmann's anhalt history, vol. V, p. 175, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 36 f. and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 159. 

Christ our dear Lord comforts E. F. G. Herz with his bodily incarnation, which he has put on to comfort and please all men, as the dear angels sing today: "Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill toward men. | hope that E. F. G. Herz will not have any doubt or sadness because of the faith or the Gospel, as now it is well reported what the truth is against the devil's and his pope's lies. But if the doctrine and the faith are well established, then let hell and all the devils fall upon us, what is more? What can afflict us but perhaps our sin and evil conscience? but Christ has taken that away for us, though we sin daily. Who can frighten us but the devil? But He is greater, who dwells in us, neither is he, though faith be weak. Let the devil be holy and without sin, we 1) need the dear Savior; let the devil be vain strength, and need nothing of Christ's help and strength! We should and will gladly be weak in ourselves, so that Christ's strength may dwell in us, as S. Paul says: Virtus Christi in infirmitate perticitur. S. F. G. have not yet denied the dear Lord nor crucified him, and even if the same had happened, he nevertheless remains merciful, and has also prayed for the crucifiers. Therefore be confident, and strengthen yourself in Christ against the evil spirit, which can do nothing but falsely afflict and terrify or murder. May the dear Lord Jesus Christ, our joy and consolation, be with our heart and do not let it be desolate.

To the brother in Christo, Mr. Anton Lauterbach, the faithful and loud servant of the word in the church of Leisnig. 

Grace and peace in Christ! So you shall do, my dear Anton: Be strong in silence and hope [ls. 30, 15.], and through Christ you will overcome this word twister (Grammaticosophistam) ("with silence one can answer for many things", especially in such matters), until we can free you from this profession in a suitable way and transfer you elsewhere, as we certainly intend to do. In the meantime, it is better and more honorable for you to suffer the injustice of that one than to inflict it on him. "Right is found at last." 

You have made me doubtful about Johann Gilden (Aureo Johoanne) 2). For | have been informed that he is a prisoner at the castle of Leuchteuburg 3) unless, 


1) Although neither Seidemann nor Burkhardt have commented on this time determination given by De Wette, it seems to us that this letter is more correctly placed in the year 1535: firstly, because it was customary to begin the new year with Christmas; secondly, because Johann Aureus, of whom we read in this letter that he was a prisoner in the Leuchtenburg castle, was recommended by Melanchthon, who had held an interrogation there as visitator on January 13, 1536. January 1536, as visitator, had held an interrogation, is recommended to the grace of the Elector on January 19 (Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 17). It can hardly be assumed that he was held prisoner until December 1536.

Intercession for Anna from the lady. 


The original is in the Haus- und Staats-Archiv at Coburg. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 273 f. 

G. and peace in Christ and my poor Paternoster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The good woman Hanna asks of the lady, who three years ago was expelled from Duke Georgen's country for the sake of the Gospel and who came under the wing of E. C. F. G. with a small outpost of the monastery Buche 3) for three years, as E. C. F. G. will be well mindful of it. Now the time for future Christmas is over, and there are many hands after it, and they still have nothing of their own or certain, that E. C. F. G. nevertheless wanted to look at their misery and leave them still some years on the little estate, until they got something of their own. And it may well be that there are some of our people who have little mercy on such outcasts and would rather have everything in their sack. Accordingly, my humble request is, 


1) That is: somehow. 

2) That this letter belongs to the year 1536, results from the acts of the Ernestinischen Gesammtarchivs, Oo, pag. 792. 80, since Anna von der Dame and her husband, Franz von der Dame, already held the estate for 6 years in 1539, after the extension (requested in this letter) to three more years had taken place in 1536. The date can be approximately determined from the words of our letter: "Now the time is out for future Christmas", namely: "about November or the beginning of December". - In 1539, the sequestrators reported badly about their economy and the estate was taken away from them. 

3) Namely Wendishayn (Burkhardt). 


where E. C. F. G. would continue to show their mercy in this, wanted to provide this with seriousness and not let the good people be disparaged, whether someone might have it in mind, as they are concerned. It is only right, because they have suffered so much for the sake of Christ and are pious, that they find refreshment and consolation under E. C. F. G.. May our dear Lord God grant that C.F.G. may do His very best will. E.C.F.G. subservient Mart. Luther.

To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


The Elector had instructed Luther to draw up articles for the purpose of the negotiations to be held at the Concilium. Luther had drafted them (later called the Schmalkaldic Articles), consulted with some of his colleagues, and now sent them to the Elector.

To the most illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Lord John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave in Thuringia and Margrave in Meissen, my most gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ, and my poor Pater Noster 2c. Most illustrious, highborn prince, most gracious lord! By E. C. F. G.'s writing and orders, | have summoned Niclas Amsdorf, M. Eisleben, 1) and M. Spalatin to come here on the day of Innocentium [Dec. 28, 1536] or the next thereafter (for Er Just 2) and Friedrich are too far away for us). To these I have submitted the articles that | myself have written (according to E. C. F. G.'s command), and have discussed them with them for several days due to my weakness, so that | have fallen three times, as | have fallen eight times, due to Satan, otherwise | would have hoped not to discuss them for more than one day. And as these are confirmed by them with their signed hand, | hereby send to our dear confrere and good friend, M. Georgen Spalatinum, E. C. F. G., as they all commanded me and asked me to do so. In addition, | also ask you to do this for the sake of all of us, because some people suspect us and say that we priests (as they call it) want to put you princes and lords with lands and people in danger with our stiff- necked behavior. 2c, E. C. F. G. would graciously refrain us from doing so; for where it should be yearly for others of lesser rank, let alone E. C. F. G. himself, together with other lords, lands and people, we would much rather take it upon ourselves alone. Therefore, E. C. F. G. will know well how far and wide they want to accept such articles; for we do not want to burden anyone else with this, but ourselves alone, leaving everyone free who wants to take care of himself. 


1) The Elector did not like that Eisleben appeared on the day in Schmalkalden, because of the relationship with Ulrich of Wirtemberg; he should therefore provide the court preacher position or be used for the visitation; according to the letter of January 9 (Burkhardt). 

2) "Er Just" is Justus Menius in Erfurt; "Friedrich" is Friedrich Myconius in Gotha.

January 7, 1537. Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


Answer to the previous letter. The Elector thanks for the transmission of the articles and expresses his joy that they are so Christian, pure, and clean, in unanimity with the other theologians. He does not want to leave the theologians alone in the danger that would come from such articles, but to confess them with them as divine and right, should he also lose his principality over them. Finally, he explains his dissatisfaction with Melanchthon's addition of the pope (see St. Louis edition, vol. XVI, 1949).

GOtt walts. Johann Friedrich. 

Our greeting and gracious will beforehand. Worthy, dear devotee! We have received your letter together with the articles in which you, by God's grace, compared yourselves with the other theologians, your fellow ministers, through M. Spalatinum, and give thanks to God Almighty and our Lord Christ that He has given you health and strength to produce such articles in such a Christian, pure and honest manner, and that He has given you grace that you have compared yourselves with the others of your kind unanimously, Christianly, and also fraternally and kindly, 3) and also take your diligence and effort, which you have shown therein for the benefit of the common Christianity, as a gracious favor, 3) also accept your diligence and effort, which you have put into it for the benefit of the common Christianity, as a gracious favor and thanks, and also from the fact that you have not changed your mind in anything, but are constantly based on the Christian articles, which you have always taught, preached and written, and which are also built on the foundation, our Lord Christ, which the gates of hell are not able to overthrow, and which will also remain well before the Pope, Concilio and his followers. May the Almighty God grant us all His grace through our Lord Christ, so that we may remain in it with constant, true faith, and that no human fear or discretion may turn us away from it 4).

let. And we can well consider that there are people who speak of such and other divine dealings in such a way that you and others, who preach and describe the holy gospel purely and loudly out of divine desire, lead (lead) into strife, danger and trouble. But what these people ask about God and His only saving Word, and what they worry about, can well be inferred from this, and also that they care little about living under the Pabstacy or the Turks, if they would only have peace, quiet and good, peaceful days with their mammon, and from time to time they would scrape up more good things for themselves. But we know, praise God, that the things which you lead from the divine word, and which we confess to be divine and right, are not human, but divine things, and which want to be known before the world, and not denied, so that we do not have to be subjected to the frightening saying that because we do not know him before the world, he does not want to know us before his heavenly Father either. Since these things have been given the opportunity, and the articles have been written in such a way that no one can overturn them with divine truth, they are also so clear and understandable that we, as a layman, in praise of God and in accordance with the previous Augsburg Confession, consider and understand them to be Christian and right, and do not know any further advice about them after we have read them for the second time, but accept them as divine, Christian, and right, and wish to have them freely confessed before a council and before the whole world, even if it should come to that, and ask God to give grace to our brother and us, and also to our descendants, so that we may persevere and remain in them constantly and without wavering. 

But as far as the dangers and journeys are concerned, which our country and people, as well as [other] 1) persons, might encounter because of this, [we want to] 1) turn them over to God, after he says that the hairs on our heads are all numbered, and we may not lose any of them without his divine will: He will also, for the sake of the journey, decree and make it according to His divine will with our brother, with us and our children, with the land and the people, to whom we will restore it to His will, for He has chosen us to be a prince. If it is his will, he will keep us well, but if it is not his will, no worrying about danger will help, because he will. 


1) Added by us. 





as is pleasing to him, to whom we _ have recommended it, and in your prayers and those of other Christians. 


For the sake of the pope, we have no hesitation at all in opposing him most vehemently. For if, out of good opinion and for the sake of peace, as M. Philip claims, 2) we let him remain a lord who commands us and our bishops, pastors and preachers, we would put ourselves on the road and in trouble, because he would not rest and his descendants would not be able to completely destroy and exterminate us and all our descendants, which we do not need at all, because God's word frees and redeems us from it. With our wisdom, and since we have once been freed from our Babylonian prison by God, and have again put ourselves in such danger, thus tempting God, it should be imposed on us by God, which will otherwise remain without any doubt. We did not want to restrain you on your letter of gracious opinion, and hope that our God will grant you grace, strength and health, that you may make the journey with us _ towards Schmalkalden, and that you will help to make these and other things right and bring them to a good end.

Grace and peace in the Lord! So far, my dearest son, | have enjoyed your studies and the letters you have written to me. If you continue in this way, you will not only do something pleasant for me, as your father, who loves you, but it will also benefit you the most that you do not seem to be out of sorts, so make sure that you diligently continue what you have begun. For God, who commanded that children should be obedient to their parents, has also promised blessings to obedient children. See to it that you have this blessing solely in mind, and do not let yourself be distracted from it by any evil examples. For the same God has also threatened the disobedient children with a curse. Therefore, fear God, who blesses and curses, who, though He has made His promises and His threats to the destruction of the wicked, is quick to turn them into a 


1) About this time determination De Wette says: Probably this letter belongs to a later time, when Johann studied in Torgau, where he came in August 1542. Because in the year 1537 he was only 10-1/2 years old, and Luther had still in the year 1539 the M. Franciscus (Great) as a court master of his children in the house.

Your mother has ordered you to greet the teacher and his wife.

Duke Albrecht of Prussia to Luther. (Regest.) 


The duke reports: Hans von Kreuz, whom he had sent to Luther in order to dissuade him from the intended violent writing Against Cardinal Albrecht of Mainz, had delivered Luther's answer to him: that he could not answer for this before God, because the Cardinal was not only after the goods of the Protestants, but also after life and limb; but that he wanted to behave mildly, if the Duke and others wanted to resist such activity. Thereupon the duke asks him not to hurry the matter and to admonish the Cardinal in secret in a Christian way beforehand 2c.

Grace and peace in the Lord! Although | believe, my best Jonas, that this will come to you somewhat slowly, | still wanted to indicate that we hope that you will be healthy again from the stone at this hour, and that our prayers will be heard. The rumor repeatedly comes to us that the most holy legate, namely the one from Aix 1) is on his way from Nuremberg to our prince. This is written to the Prince from Coburg, who has replied that if he should come, they should instruct him to go to Schmalkalden. There he will be expected if his arrival is true. If, | say, his arrival is true, then he is undoubtedly not coming out of fear of the Turk, but on the advice and through the mediation of the Turk, to seek help 2c. For what else are the Lutherans but sheep for slaughter; not other than when these raging murderers may need their help? But we shall see. The chancellor of the emperor, Doctor Matthias Held, will also be there, and perhaps this meeting will be larger than one has believed on both sides. God grant that it will be a proper concilium. 

There is a canon from Zeitz here, but a renegade from his order, since he has taken a wife; he swears and assures as much as he can that there will be more learned men at this meeting than even (if it should take place) at the Concil at Mantua. | write this to comfort you. For the desire for you 2) is extraordinary. Farewell and visit my family, and also Pomeranian Rome with its little whorls. We are healthy and cheerful, yes, we are being kept splendidly by the prince, since we have been entertained in his castles at Grimma and Altenburg, and provided for in the best way. For we hoped that we would only be guests of old Pylades and Theseus 3). Therefore, in our own way (as you know), we played our joke on him in verse. | send here mine, M. Phi

Letters from the year 


Grace and peace in Christ! | wanted to write to you, my dear Jonas, while there is still leisure, because afterwards we will be forced to act here and to let ourselves be acted upon, and there is no hope that we will leave here before Latare [March 11], so that a large crowd of affairs and people will flow together from all sides. Many think that even at the Concil at Mantua not so many learned men will come together, although 1) there will perhaps come many more mules, asses and horses, which as riders also carry very large asses and horses, as it is written (according to the citation of Peter Balbinus) [Ps. 32, 9]: "Be not as horses and mouths that have no understanding." Yesterday the Landgrave and the Duke of Wirtemberg entered with great pomp; today the princes are in secret consultation; meanwhile we have leisure and write to you. | can neither know nor guess what will be done. Yesterday Spalatin preached, today | preached before the princes in the parish church, which is so large and high that the voice of both of us would have been like that of a shrew. The place and the air are healthy, and we are quite at ease. You alone are missing, who also want to watch and wish to fall into the eyes among so many excellent men. Yesterday | suffered from the stone, but it passed painlessly through dark (nigram) urine, so that it itself did not know that it was a stone (namely so it is crushed to an actual liquid), and also | did not notice the secret guest before the excretion; therefore | would rather that it be and remain in such a way a secret (clanculum) than a stone (calculus). Now, if your calculus would also become a clanculus, that would be something that we would like to grant you and that you would be happy about. The Roman legate has traveled from Weimar to Halle to see the Cardinal, perhaps unwilling that he has not been granted an interview with the prince, for he has not yet been seen here.

To the honorable, prudent Mr. Jakob Meyer, Mayor of the City of Basel, my dear Lord and generous friend. 


Grace and peace in Christ! Honorable, careful, dear Lord and friend. | have received and listened to all of your writing, along with other writings, including those of the Confederates, and have almost happily and gladly noted your diligence and earnestness in promoting the Gospel of Christ. May God Almighty henceforth give us more and more grace, so that we may all agree together in true unity and certain unanimous doctrine and opinion, as St. Paul says, that we should all with one heart and one mouth praise God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and forgive and bear with one another, just as God the Father forgives and bears with us in Christ Jesus. Now it is no wonder, since we are still alive in the flesh, that both ours and yours may be suspicious of each other, since we have not discussed this matter in jest or invective, but seriously, and have disagreed with each other, as they have not been able to do or disagree about any frivolous matter: That here it will be necessary, in addition to Christian love, to forget the pranks and pains, and to strive all the more earnestly again for unity, be it with patience, litter, good conversation, and by whatever means it can and may be done, but especially with heartfelt prayer to God, the dear Father, who is the Father of all unity, comfort and love. For this reason, | again ask you most sincerely to persevere with yours faithfully, and to help that they will all help to calm things, to glimpse and to promote them for the best. It should also not be up to us

Tambach. February 27, 1537. To Melanchthon in Schmalkalden. 


Luther's stone disease had worsened greatly, so he asked to be taken away from Schmalkalden. This happened on February 26. When he arrived in Tambach in the evening, the strong movement of his body had brought about relief, of which Luther informed Melanchthon in the night at 3 o'clock through this letter.

Wirtemberg admired Luther's courage that he had dared to leave in the face of such a serious illness and was even thinking of leaving because he had been ill for eight days. Melanchthon was extremely saddened, especially because no help could have been procured for Luther there, and he had also noticed that mistakes had been made in the medical treatment 2c.

To D. Martin Luther. 

Hail! With all my heart | give thanks to God, the Father of mercies, and to our Lord Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who represents us and has compassion on our weaknesses, that he has begun to alleviate the danger of the great sickness. For | rejoice with all my heart, both for your sake and for the sake of the commonwealth, that you have come back to life, and this joy is made greater by the fact that we have seen an example by which God has clearly testified that He graciously looks upon this church of ours. Here, all the princes and other good men's faces and meetings were brighter after your letter was brought, indicating hope for life. They recognize that through your ministry the light of the gospel has been brought to light again, and realize that they owe this to you, but at the same time they foresee how great harm the church would receive if you were snatched away from us. Therefore, it is the wish of all of them that you remain with us for a long time, and they thank God for having called you back to life, as it were, in the midst of death. And | hope that this joy is pleasing to GOtte, and thanksgiving, because by many persons grace is gratefully acknowledged against us in many ways [2 Cor. 1, 11.]. 

| pray to God through our Lord Jesus Christ to restore you completely and make you well. Here the deliberations are not yet finished about the answer to be given to the emperor's orator to his disputation, which he has made in an exceedingly harsh manner about the earlier answer. Therefore, the papal nuncio has also not yet received an answer. The Duke of Wirtemberg praises the greatness of your courage that you have dared to set out on the journey in such an illness and have escaped from this cave. He says that he will follow your example, for he has been ill for more than eight days and has decided to leave tomorrow. Christ grant that | may see you shortly unharmed and restored to good health.

Grace and peace in Christ! Finally | am writing, my dear Spalatin, after | have now spent so many days resting with my pen on the Sabbath; | am gradually recovering, thanks be to God, and am learning anew to eat and drink, even though my thighs and knees and bones are wavering and cannot yet support the body completely.

(Wittenberg.) March or later 1) 1537. Luther's testimony that he is still alive. 


A rumor had come to Hall im Innthal from Italy that Luther had died, and his epitaph was written in German, Hebrew, Greek and Latin script. The papists were very pleased about this. Since many were saddened by this news, a messenger was sent from there to get a copy of this inscription. But when the messenger found Luther alive, he said to him, "Because | find your visibility alive, | ask you to give me a writing from your grave, so that | may comfort the pious people who are distressed." Doctor Martin said with a smile: "That is a wonderful thing; | have not yet written one of my days of my burial"; and finally he wrote the following: (Loesche, Analecta Lutherana, et Melanchthoniana,, p. 239, No. 367.) 


This letter is found in Walch, vol. XXI, 1595; in Bindeseil, Colloquia,, tom. Ill, p. 171; in Erlanger Ausgabe, vol. 65, p. 221; in Kummer, p. 330 b (Lauterbach, p. 203; Serapeum 1870, p. 174); in Loesche I. c., p. 239; in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 193 2c. We give the text after Bindeseil. 


|, Doctor Martin Luther, confess with this manuscript of mine that | am of one mind with the devil, the pope and all my enemies. For they would have liked me to die, and | grudged them such joy from the bottom of my heart, and would have gladly died in Schmalkalden, but God has not yet wanted to confirm such joy. He will do it, however, before they think, not to greater 2) happiness, and will sing once: Oh, that Luther were still alive! 3) This is the transcript from my grave German, Greek, Latin, Hebrew.

About the dismissal of the preacher in Stettin, Paul von Rhoda, whom Luther and Bugenhagen had proposed as superintendent of the city of Luneburg. 


From a manuscript of the Gothaische Bibliothek in the Leipzig Supplement, p.81, No.145; in Walch, vol. XXI, 394; in the Consil. Viteb., P. Il, p. 50; from the original in Dan. Cramer's Pomeranian Church Hist., /ib. Ill, cap. 36; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 60 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 175. 


Grace and peace from God through Christ our Lord. Most noble, highborn prince, gracious lord! To E. F. G.'s letter to us, as it has reached them, that M. Paul of Rhoda has promised before us to go from our lands to another place with service, which E. F. G. is not willing to permit for reasons given, and graciously request of us that we grant such permission to M. Paul. Paulum of such permission, with gracious request to take the cause and burden from him: we do not know how to hold E. F. G. to a true report, that we neither advise nor ask the aforementioned M. Paulum to take the cause and burden from him. Paulum that he should turn away from the lands of the Holy See, but rather, before this time, several years have passed, instructed him with serious admonitions that he should remain in Stettin, so that the teachings of the Holy Gospel would not perish there, and also so that rebellion and other troubles, which might otherwise have occurred, would be prevented, that 4) up to now, he has also held himself in honor of the Gospel, and for the benefit of the city of Stettin, as benevolent. Although he _ often complained to us about his lack and need, that it would be difficult for him to stay with them both in poverty and driving, while the gospel was still persecuted, and especially because he often asked that good orders be made to order the churches, and after they had been made, 5) that execution and follow-up be done, so that they would be put into practice, which remained so long, he also often promised, after he had been arrested with debts, to remedy his lack; however, he said that he had not been able to do so. 


4) "deB" put by us instead of: "that". 5) "have been" put by us instead of: "would". 


2164 


In vain he hoped for it, and in the end he let himself be heard many times that he wanted and had to go to another place, which we do not know how to blame him for, since there is none of us for whom it would not be too difficult to stay like this, both in poverty, driving and contempt. Because all this, which M. Paul brought forward, remained unheeded, he lastly, of which we knew nothing at all, before he was sent by E. F. G. to Schmalkalden, publicly requested and took leave, and told the city of Stettin to continue to serve, which he had good reason to do even after Christ's command in such contempt. Afterwards, when an honest legation was sent by the city of LUneburg, which followed us from our absence in Wittenberg to Schmalkalden, and from the city now mentioned asked us to provide them with a superintendent, which they did four years ago, but we did not have such a person to give them until now; and after M. Paulus at Schmalkalden had presented his distress to us, and we know, as also E. F. G., in her letter, the testimony to him. in their letter give him the testimony that he has done enough in his office in a godly and Christian way, that the fault of his coming from Stettin was not with him, we also had no other person to report to those of Liineburg, although we do not like to see that he has to hand over the city of Stettin: we have nevertheless let it happen, after he was now free, that he promised the city of LUneburg, as we have also attributed this to them. But that E. F. G. write that they are not willing to let the much- mentioned M. Paulum leave them: we want to have reminded E. F. G. humbly, as E. F. G. from a high intellect can well consider how this could be excused, after the poor man M. Paulus has served so faithfully for so long. Paul served so long faithfully, also in the persecution of the Gospel in great driving, poverty and misery, and great diligence, counsel and help against sedition and other mischief to peace and unity, and E. F. G. and the authorities of the church have been able to keep the peace and unity. F. G. and the authorities to obedience, as E. F. G. himself knows better. That for such faithful service and diligence, he should now be so stricken by E. F. G. that he should not turn away from E. F. G. lands, and be guilty of such misery not only to his food, 


Letters from the year 1537. No. 2353. 





2165 


but also a burden on his conscience, that he does not feel any improvement in his own, to suffer eternally: E. F. G. can well think that not the least craftsman would move into E. F. G.'s country. F. G.'s country, let alone that a foreign preacher would want to come into the country of Pomerania. 

Now the good man M. Paul has not done anything wrong that he should be stopped against his will. E. F. G. should graciously grant us this, for we know that E. F. G. has no bad opinion in this matter; we also cannot blame E. F. G. that they would gladly keep such preachers in their country, if only it were held with them in such a way that they could stay. In addition, E. F. G. must also take into consideration that the oft- mentioned M. Paulus has never been obligated to E. F. G. with service or pay, but only E. F. G. city of Stettin. F. G. city of Stettin. Now it would be a disparity that they would want to give him leave if they wanted to, and he would therefore always have to sit idle and on the go, and should not in turn also have the power to take leave from them where his need requires it. But that E. F. G. to us to leave the accepted service is not our business; it is also not up to us to change such a promise, which he made before us to an honest legation; which we neither advised him to do, nor did we order him to do, but since we heard that he had taken leave from the city of Stettin and was now free, and saw that he was inclined to join those of LUneburg, we had to allow it and grant him that he would improve, and thus attributed this on his behalf to the council of Liineburg. If, however, M. Paulus would be willing to remain with them upon improvement, as E. F. G. and the city of Stettin request, and E. F. G. or the city of Stettin would not be willing to do. F. G. or the city of Stettin would know how to obtain from the city of LUneburg that they release M. Paul from his promise: it would not be at all contrary to us, but would also be pleased about it, and would like it from the bottom of our hearts that the good city and E. F. G. would be able to be with them. F. G.'s entire country be provided with such and more good preachers. And in this case, we are willing and ready, moreover, that 1) we also

Summa, we put all this on E. F.'s high intellect, if M. Paul wants to remain willingly, as itis through E. F. G. or the city of Stettin, or also through our gracious Lord, the Prince of Luneburg, whom E. F. G., who E. F. G., if it were deemed necessary, could use as a mediator in this matter, may be obtained from the city of Luineburg that we do not break the promise we made to those of LUneburg at their request and M. Pauli's approval, so that this city does not complain about us as if we had made a promise that we did not keep. Hereby we command E. F. G. in God's grace, and E. F. G. to serve us. F.

The king asks Luthern to pursue Bugenhagen's resettlement in Denmark. His preachers had written a church order and submitted it to him for review, which he sent to Luthern for his perusal, referring to the controversial question among his German preachers as to whether the Lord's Supper should be served immediately or only after proper instruction in both forms.

No. 2357. Capito to Luther. 


(Regest.) 

The rumor had spread among the Jews of Strasbourg that the Elector of Saxony, as a result of a crime committed by Jews, had expelled the Jews from his territory and forbidden them to travel through it under heavy penalty. Referring to the tolerance practiced against the Jews in Strasbourg, Capito recommends a Jew who is respected in Alsace, Joseph, whose request for the withdrawal of this harsh prohibition Luther should support with the Elector.

To Conrad Cordatus, pastor at Niemeck. 

About Cordatus' call to Eisleben and his melancholy. 

Handwritten by Aurifaber in his unprinted collection. Printed by Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 227 and by De Wette, vol. V, p. 65. German by Walch, vol. XXI, 1455. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Your appointment to my hometown Eisleben would please me very much, my dear Cordatus, because there you would be an effective opponent against the Wicel, whom you hate with vain holy and just hatred; only you should go there first to take a look at everything; then you could leave the Niemeck corner, if it pleased you, without regret. What God has decreed would happen, and | would like to see it. There, perhaps, a more wholesome air would blow for you than the swamp air here, since the air is purified day and night by so many fires. 

| thank God that your health has returned. But, | ask you to curb your suspicion, which imagines | don't know how many illnesses. You know the saying: Imagination makes it come true (I/maginatio facit casum). That is why you have to make an effort to start the thoughts, not to take them up. For | too must do this. For our adversary, the devil, goes about us, not only to devour the soul, but also to make our body weary by the thoughts of the soul, whether he might kill it, knowing that the health of the body is great. 





depends partly on the thoughts of the soul, as it is said: "Good courage, half the body," and [Proverbs 17:22]: "A sad courage dries up the bones, but a cheerful heart makes life merry. This | teach you, although in the meantime | do not teach myself, as Paul in the letter to the Romans [Cap. 2, 21.] paints the Jews. Be well in the Lord.

G. u. Fried 2c. and my poor Father Noster etc. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The good people of Wolf Schalreuter's imprisoned friendship ask that | write to E. C.F.G. on his behalf for mercy; as they also did to M. G. H. Duke Johann's Ernsten, whether eternal imprisonment was imposed on him, in order that such a journey as they report in their writing might be changed. But forgive me, E. C. F. G. will consider such causes graciously, and will act accordingly; for where there would be such a true need, as they write, it has its opinion. But because |, often witty with evil things, have become stupid to ask, | still do not want to deny my service to poor people, where it is possible. C. F. G. gracious concern, [and E. C. F. G.

2) In the "program" "t," is displaced: it offers: "wisse eint, pious". Burkhardt has made this printing error knowingly, because he notes: "so f. wisset ein". 

3) We suppose: "thate" (thette).

He asks Luther to intercede for an appropriate settlement from the monastery estates of Lichtenberg. - Accordingly, Luther addressed the next letter to the Elector. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. LI, p. 172. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 278. 


Venerable, Respectable, Esteemed, Generous Lord and Patron! E. E., | hope that you will remember that | petitioned you about a year ago in Wittenberg, in the presence of Heinrich Baumgart, the Lord's gardener, on account of my departure from Lichtenberg, that |, a poor man, who for sixteen years had been employed in the two houses in Lichtenberg and zur Eichen, and likewise on the farm for nine years, had not been given more than 20 fl. | had to give the preceptor a prescription for this, but the others received a hundred guilders in compensation. In addition, they have sold a golden head or credenza with a unicorn's foot, which the old preceptor GoBwinus gave to the entire collection for a testament, as well as eight silver bowls, which are also the responsibility of the brothers of the convent; the golden head, as | have reported, was given for 200 fl. the same 200 florins and what they bought from the bowls, likewise several silver cups and spoons, all divided among themselves, and gave me poor man none of it, despite the fact that | was one of the chief abbot of Vienna and the old preceptor GoBwino,

of which | still have letters and seals with me, | am bound to be provided for and preserved by the touched monastery property for the rest of my life. Thus, with truth, no other cause can be attributed to my low, unequal compensation than that |, according to God's gracious will, have turned to the holy Gospel first among them and, according to my need, have entered the marriage state, although | did not do so without the foreknowledge and advice of the Lord Preceptor, who then directed me to the High Angels in Wittenberg to ask them for advice in this matter, whereupon | dared to do so in the name of God, and became married. For this reason | ask E. E. as my generous Lord and dear Father in Christ JEsu, where it is possible for E. E. without disadvantage with our G. H., the Elector, and should also be right with our Lord God, that E. E. would petition me, a poor man, against our most gracious Lord with a writing, that his Electors would help me, my poor wife and small children, of whom | have six, two boys and four maidens, praising God, to the good and grace of the same, and that |, without hindrance of my prescription, which | had to do to the Preceptor of the 20 Fl. | have to do, also as much as the other Lichtenberg brothers get one for clearance, and thus my children, as the boys to school, and the Maidlein, which two can fairly write and read, now help to teach something else, and to provide a little house for them, in which they would like to live after my death, since | have not been able to buy so much in the parish here in Prettin, that | have bought [my] own little house, yes, | have added 200 guldens; GOtte ordered.

No. 2363. (Wittenberg.) June 29, 1537. 


To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


Luther presents the request of Severin Schultze to the Elector. - The passage enclosed in square brackets in this letter is not in the original, as already noted by De Wette. Burkhardt. p. 280. reports that the note, which has quite different writing from Luther's than the letter itself, was perhaps accidentally enclosed with the letter. 





The editors of the Leipzig Supplement and Walch saw him. - It is an intercession for the old Schésser zu Beltitz. Therefore it will be wrong that Burkhardt I. c. refers "to the matter" from the letter No. 2301, because there the debtor is Kunz Pfeilschmidt, Schésser zu Schweinitz, and the debt sum 400 fl.; in contrast, here the debtor is the Schésser zu Beltitz, and the debt 200 gulden. This is confirmed by Burkhardt himself in his note p. 269. Whether the note belongs to the year 1537 is uncertain.

G. & Peace in Christo and my poor Pr. nr. etc. Most 

Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | humbly inform E. C. F. G. what the pastor of Brettin has asked me to write to E. C. F. G. and to ask, as E. C. F. G. may understand from the enclosed writing 1) (so E. C. F. G. want to have it read). Now itis true that | have been to Lichtenberg, and have also heard vehement complaints against the good man, D. ReiBebusch, and yet have known no way to advise in this; for | have heard from some that it is in vain that | should make intercession to him, when he should have received so much from the Lichtenberg monastery that it would be no harm to him to throw a hundred or six into the Rappuse among the brethren, and to satisfy [them] with it. Now it is also true that this priest has so many children and needs almost all of them. But because there is no other advice here, than whether C.F.G. can help a little with the aforementioned D. ReiBenbusch: | will have asked C.F.G. humbly, as C.F.G. wants to be done without burden, will graciously show himself. 2) Hiemit GOtt befehlt, Amen. 3) [Also | ask for the sake of God, most gracious 


1) This is the previous letter that came into the Weimar archive in this way. 

2) As we can conclude from Luther's letter to ReiBenbusch of Nov. 25, 1537, the Elector himself did not settle this matter, but assigned it to Luther. 

3) For the following piece we have used the improvements given by Burkhardt.

Lord, for | cannot get rid of the people from my neck. However much | am otherwise burdened with writings, | have to give E. C. F. G. also complain. The old locksmith at Peltitz (Beltitz, Beltig), for whom | also wrote, 1) is here, and asks for God's sake, E. C. F. G. to leave it at the 200 fl., but if he has surrendered body and soul, nothing is ever helped E. C. F. G. with his ruin. | also hear that he is claiming to E. C. F. G., as if his property should be worth 1600 fl., which now a part of himself confesses, that probably 1000 fl. are missing, yet E. C. F. G. has lost many a 1000 fl. in the past year in the damned godless service, and still loses it daily, even in other small things, E. C. F. G. also wanted to lose such a small amount in this poor man, for the sake of Christian love. Is it not a strange thing that princes gain wealth badly, and are killed even worse; it is their way and fall ordained by God. E. C. F.

Who can create such a begging service for the noblemen Doctor Martinus and M. Philippus? If they want to have vain Saint Augustine and Saint Ambrose, they can provide them themselves. If a priest is sufficient and faithful to his Lord Christ, a nobleman, who is a little less than Christ, should also be satisfied. A prince must be content in his worldly regiment that he finds three pieces in the whole of his nobility and must have patience with the other filling stones. They want to have everything exquisite, but they do not want to be exquisite themselves, nor do they want to be.

The most noble Prince and Lord, Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my most gracious Lord. 

G. and F. in Christ, also my poor Father Noster. Most Serene, H. F., G. H.! | had the will to spare E. C. F. G. with this writing, and let go what is possible, because of the imprisoned M. Paulus, who with his diabolical maltreatment’ has created for us all an everlasting, unoppressive defamation, that we must be reviled everywhere as dog-burialists (although it has not been a dog). Now the jurists have become merciful in the name of the Pabst (devil), but not over us, who have to suffer such, and want to sanctify the founder of such disgrace, over which we poor theologians are bloodthirsty, so that | also (as | hope) have shown my mercy over many evildoers more than E. C. F. G. could often have suffered. Now the outcry is so great and growing that | am defending myself against the university with writing and words; if their mercy would be lacking, and my concerns would become all too true, then | would be excused, and afterwards in the pulpit | would know well how to hold myself against such jurists. 


1) Magister Paul Heinz von Libben had married the widow of the Wittenberg physician D. Heinrich Stagmann, who brought a son from the first marriage. Stagmann had left a house and some property. In order to obtain possession of the child's inheritance, the parents pretended in 1535 that the child had died of the then prevailing plague, and organized a fictitious funeral, but they took the child to a farmer near Jiiterbock. This came to light when the boy was brought back to Wittenberg on June 16, 1537. See Rebenstock, colloquia, tom. II, fol. 100 and 180; Tischreden, cap. 9, §44, St. Louis ed. vol. XXII, 374. 


important matter, | must also show myself subservient to E. C. F. G., so that | may not afterwards be able to indicate to E. C. F. G. why | have remained silent at such a time. why | would have kept silent at such a time; for the knave shall (as the whole town says) be defiant, call out at the top of the window, and drop letters, one of which comes to me in the pulpit, in which he desires (although | did not know who the person was) that one should pray for a wretched man who would be abandoned by all men, and no man would take care of him: this you deny (said 1), for here am | and the caplains 2c. And do the woman and her friendship great defiance, as if they have done nothing wrong. 

Therefore, to protect my conscience, as well as my loyalty to E. C. F. G., | humbly ask, if the matter against E. C. F. G. would be so holy and well done, that E. C. F. G. would procure a delay in this until E. C. F. G. himself comes here and learns the matter thoroughly; for he can well sit so long in such a sorry dungeon. E. C. F. G. would graciously grant me such a writing, | may be angry not without cause; but | would like that one may not say afterwards: Who would have meant that! and we would nevertheless have to have the slippers. My judgment is, what they have buried, | let go; but because they have let their child be buried for a year and a half and kept silent, they shall have buried it and killed it, if the child can experience Methusalah. E. C. F. G. wanted to consider this my writing for the coat, shirt or skirt, but nevertheless your selb honor and rumor beside the whole landscape, churches and community. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen.

Grace and peace in Christ! | wish you happiness, my dear Frederick, that God has finally given you a baby boy! | understand quite well, since you count seven daughters, how eagerly you also longed for and lovingly accepted a little son. | wish you happiness once again, and pray that he may be preserved for you and surpass you, the father, in all gifts, amen. Since you boast that your constancy is praised by your magistrate, that you denied me, who desired it, a grave in your diocese, | have at least meanwhile very often regretted that | was not buried in your city. 1) For now that | am restored to health, | see such things that | would not have seen if | had been buried in God or in Gotha. But the victor over all, Christ, overcomes even this little evil. Just as there are more angels with us who believe, there are also more goods with us who see. For even though all others have eyes, they do not see the Lord, as Paul says in | Cor. 2:2 9. My Lord Kathe greets you and wishes you happiness for the son you have born, but she warns you to abstain from the milk of the son and to leave the mother alone until the son is weaned from the milk (ablactetur == weaned). The other you will understand as a husband, although she also despairs that you will obey her request. Fare well in the Lord.

1) Luther is talking here about the time when he left Schmalkalden because of his stone disease and received relief at Tambach, but was still in great danger of his life on February 27 and the following days at Gotha. See letters No. 2347, 2348 and 2349.

Handwritten at Gotha, Cod. 185.4. Printed by Buddeus, p. 256 and by De Wette, vol. V, p. 74 f. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1280. To the most famous poet of our time, who is both godly and chaste, Mr. Eoban Hesse, his exceedingly dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. | have received your Psalter, most famous Eoban, and in the Lord most dear brother, which was given to me in your name. And with the greatest pleasure | have read it, read it and will always read it, so pleasant is your work to me, which has been spent on this to me exceedingly lovely book. | give you the greatest possible thanks that through your so kind, so godly muses | have been allowed to see this royal, divine, and among the Hebrew most excellent poem made into a Latin one. For | also praise the efforts of all others who have put their toil into translating, explaining and decorating this poem, even though they may not attain everything somewhere, for not all of us can do everything; with the exception of those [whom | do not praise], 3) who bring us the Jewish darknesses into the exceedingly bright light of some Psalms, for | cannot help but look at this with distaste. So | like yours the best, you who were invented as the first and perhaps the only one in the whole Latin language who so happily undertook to translate these divine poems into Latin poems, and accomplished this with equal happiness. In this way, you have indeed shown at the same time that in poets there is a spirit that comes from heavenly heights, but in you richer and stronger than in others, since you have been able to reproduce the thoughts (vires) of this royal poet, which other poets, however moved by great enthusiasm, have never recognized in the least. You would not have been able to do this in any way if you had not been moved by the things themselves beyond understanding, as we are wont to say, also in truth. But this movement does not come from nature, also not from the common power of the muses,

or is received by your ordinary inspiration, but is in truth a new gift of the Spirit and a higher inspiration from heaven. Therefore, | not only wish you happiness, but also praise my Lord Jesus Christ, who has filled you with his spirit for this godly work, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to others and serve as an example, especially to the youth, who through faithful teachers can learn from this poem both the sciences and the muses along with spiritual things and matters. For | confess that | am one of those whom poems move more strongly, delight more, and in whom they stick more firmly than unbound speech, even if it may be that of a Cicero and Demosthenes. Since this happens to me in other things, how much more will it happen to me in matters of the Psalter! With this book | have occupied myself from my youth, enjoyed and practiced, and, thanks be to God! not without great fruit. For, not to prefer my gift to the gifts of others, | boast this with a holy presumption, that for all the thrones and kingdoms of the world, as that one says, | would not want to be without the very thing, whatever it is, that | have obtained by delighting and meditating on the Psalms under the blessing of the Holy Spirit. For | do not have such foolish humility that | should pass over God's gifts, which He has bestowed upon me, with silence. Of myself, | certainly have enough and more than enough that can humble me and teach me that | am nothing; in God one must certainly be hopeful, be joyful in his gifts, triumph and boast, as | do in my own German Psalter, now even more so in your Eobanic; but all to the praise and glory of God, who is praised forever. In him be well for ever and ever, Amen. Wittenberg, August 1, 1537, Martin Luther.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! Our decreed councilors at Torgau have sent us your letter, dated the thorn day after Jacobi, which was delivered to us at Hildburghausen (Hilperhausen) on Monday after Laurentii [Aug. 13].], which we have read out and from which we have noted that you have all kinds of misgivings as to where the imprisoned Magister Paul von should be punished according to our university sentence and judgment because of his committed abuse and misdeeds, and we have asked that we want to postpone this trade until our arrival. We do not wish to reassure you in your gracious opinion that we have previously received two writings from our university, in which it has been indicated that such abuse and misdeeds should not have an explicit punishment in law, but are at the discretion of 1) the judicial office, and they are considered, and to expel him from the university liberties forever, with the attached submissive request that we would graciously yield to this and give more punitive orders that the said magistrate would also be forever banned from our and our friendly dear brother's principality and lands. After we were reported about it, as if the said magistrate should not be punished any higher, and we nevertheless had all kinds of misgivings because of this unpleasant and annoying deed, we nevertheless considered the university's request and gave our bailiff in Saxony an order for this and on the way. Because such a thing happened before and before we received your letter, you could consider how we might evade our granted permission, which in our opinion will now really be executed, 3) but you should consider that if we had received your letter sooner, we would have known how to comply with your request, and therefore graciously request, because this deal has gone so far, that you also be satisfied with it and leave it at that.

To the honorable, respectable, prudent, mayors and council of Torgau, my favorable, good lords and friends. 


G. and F. in Christ. Respectable, prudent gentlemen and friends! | have often talked with Mr. Gabriel, your pastor, about his household and what he wants to leave his wife and children. He said that he would leave him well enough off, but his Else would like a little house, as is also reasonable. Now they showed me a room (because there was no house left), on which they thought they could put one, namely at the sexton's house, as he may well show you. Now | would like to have fallen with this request to my favorable lords; so | think that it is more honest and praiseworthy for you (if it is your power) that you show yourselves friendly to your faithful pastor, who has now served with you in the word for fourteen years, and let your gratitude shine, especially because it should come or remain under civil law. Accordingly, my friendly request is that you give him such space or help him, because he lies there in vain and unregarded. In this way you will give a good testimony of your favor and love for the word and its servant, which otherwise seldom has much favor. 


prove. Please forgive me, you will show yourselves Christian and kind in this. Hiemit GOtt befehlt, Amen. Tuesday after Assumption of the Virgin Mary [Aug. 21] 1537.

Peace in Christ and my poor Paternoster! E. C. F. G. graciously gave a scholarship from a fiefdom to a city boy in Eisenach, named Hermannus Brothecker, whom he also used well and increased in theology. But now the time has come that it is over, he complains miserably, how he must leave the studio and learn a trade where he has no _ further entertainment. He therefore asks E. C. F. G. to graciously grant him the scholarship for another year or two, 2) because then he will be old enough to need it. Because he is a theologian, C.F.G. himself knows and sees what a lack of such offices is daily increasing, therefore, C.F.G. will graciously know how to show himself Christian in this to God's praise and glory; may he be with C.F.G. abundantly and steadily, amen.

Jakob Schenk to Luther. 


(Regest.) 

The brother of D. Jakob Schenk, Michael, although he did not understand Latin, was immatriculated in 1525, but left Wittenberg again and became a shift foreman in Joachimsthal. In 1537 he was again sent to Wittenberg by his brother, so that he could perfect himself in preaching and continue his studies. But Luther had Jonas order him to abstain from preaching in Wittenberg and in the entire Electorate. Jacob then addressed this letter to Luther and asked that his brother be allowed to preach, since there had been no explicit command so far that the permission of the theological faculty was necessary for preaching. He himself, since he had been lent by Luther to Freiberg only for a short time, wanted to return to Wittenberg for a year in order to study and to show his gratitude and to help honor the university and its law.

After a closer examination, it turned out that the sermons were antinomian. (See St. Louis Edition, Vol. XX, Introduction, p. 50d f.)

Our greeting before. Worthy, dear devotee |! We have heard the contents of your letter now sent to us, and that [the] venerable and reverend, our dear devotee, Martin Luther, Doctor, is thankfully fresh and healthy, and also preaches and walks weekly. We have graciously and gladly heard this, and we hope to God Almighty that His omnipotence will graciously preserve and maintain him in long-term health for the promotion of His salvific word, and also for the comfort of Christendom. The report that you have given us about the message, 2) which the said Doct. Martinus gave to a man from Germany who had been made so that he was still alive, we also heard it with pleasure. And since such reports and cries resounded in Germany, we believe that it came from the fact that Doct. Martinus was so very and severely ill in Schmalkalden. 

We also like to believe that the aforementioned Doctor Martinus will be tried hard enough by our mistress, the Margravine, and her daughters, but since this is what happened with her dear arrival in Wittenberg, there can be no change. 

We have also ordered the transfer of Magister Georgen RGrer, but he has to follow the instructions of the

We will be patient about this until we, God willing, come back to Torgau; then we will prepare the same and have it sent to him. 

(2) Thus we have also, as you know, previously allowed ourselves that Doct. Martinus' sermons and lectures are brought together by him and copied into the Liberei during his life, 1) we have also ordered you, as we know no other way, to look for someone to transcribe such sermons and lectures. As this is once again our gracious request that you seek one, for we would like such work to be done in a beneficial way, we also do not want it to lack due remuneration and reward, for whatever it may be, we do not want it to lack. 

3) As for some of the great contracts that are to be made in the Liberei, we want to think about them and, if we come to Torgau, let us be heard about them.

Grace and peace in Christ! The chancellor has told me, my dear Fesel, that my petition has been promoted, as you will perhaps also hear from Kastner and H. von Sternberg. For the Prince is very indignant about those who neglect what has been decreed by the Visitation, and they have been soundly scolded. If you should perhaps see that the Kastner is disturbed by this scolding, you can comfort him, because this scolding was not directed against him, but against the one to whom it was due. For | am afraid that if he has already been disturbed or troubled, it may now come to the ears of his wife, and disturb the very good woman even more. Your salaries will now be put in order and taken care of again. And they 1) will call obstetricians, because

Ordination certificate for Jakob Stigel. 


From the Cyprian collection at Gotha in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 48 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 78. 


Jakob Stigel, from Moravia, came here and reported that he had been called by the church in Saalfeld to the office of a deacon, and asked that he be given the office of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments by public ordination, as is customary in our church. Since he had a testimony of his calling and approved the way of the church in Saalfeld, we found out, after we had inquired about his doctrine, that he accepts and holds the pure doctrine of the gospel, which the general church of Christ professes and which we teach in our church, and that he has an abhorrence of all ungodly and fanatical opinions, which are rejected by the judgment of the general church of Christ, and which argue with the doctrine that is presented in our church. But he has promised diligence and faithfulness in his preaching ministry, and that he will teach and defend the very doctrine of the general church of Christ, which we confess, in a pure manner. Therefore, according to the word of God, through the reputation of our church, the calling was confirmed by public ordination and this Jacob was commanded the office of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments. This is testified by this letter. And since the church appoints church ministers by God's command, we implore with right and godly prayers that this gospel, where Jacob teaches it, may be strong, and that our Lord Jesus Christ may be rightly recognized and revered, and that many may come to godliness and be saved. Given at Wittenberg, on the seventh day of October, Anno 1537.

1) The Elector then instructed the Franconian visitators, Torgau, Sunday Martinmas [Nov. 11], to provide the petitioner with what he was entitled to (Burkhardt). 

2) Already on October 5, Luther had written to Fesel, putting him off (No. 2382), now he again brings up his matter with the Elector and asks the Vice-Chancellor to support it. Since Fesel's matter was settled on Nov. 11 by a rescript of the Elector (see the last note to the previous letter), it is highly probable that this letter went out at the same time as the previous one.

She is a child and remains a child", therefore it is nothing that a raging man has a sword and a child has money 2c. You understand why, and you advise and cooperate.

Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable, venerable sir, especially good friend! The priest of N. 2) has reported his distress to me, so | have seen it myself. His wife and child are in misery, poverty, and his housekeeping is getting sour, God knows that. But because he was paid 20 florins by N. 3), others will receive 100 florins, even though he had granted this at the time: but now there is thirst and need, so that such a grant can be considered nothing by all sensible people. And if one were to take it from Christ's feet and give it to him, it would be more of an indulgence than asin. 

Now E. A. can get the most and the best from N.3), and can easily help him from the surplus: so not only my diligent request, but also faithful advice, is that E. A. should attack himself, and fully hand him also 100 florins; considered that E. A. such small money in the case does no harm, and helps the poor man greatly. 

For | do not want to save E. A., that not only the conventuals of N., 3) but almost everyone speaks angrily and badly of E. A. taking everything to himself, and the others

the means to shut them up, and yet do not like to hear that E. A. should have a bad cry for the sake of money, especially because E. A. otherwise has enough and does not need this poverty (which the good man shall comfort himself with holy things and child). And, as many go out, they consider: it should probably zrftetzt (where E. A. wanted to be so hard) the poor cry to heaven about E. A.. 

If | were in E. A.'s place, | would throw a few hundred florins or two among them into the Rappuse, and quench such a reputation, and make my conscience the more abundantly secure and happy before God, than that | had done enough; for God gives E. A. more, and can give more. A. give, and may well give more. It says: Facite vobis amicos de Mammona iniquitatis [Make friends with the unjust Mammon]. 

| ask that E. A. understand such writing best from me, as from a good, faithful heart, which grants E. A. all honor and good, here and there. For | am compelled by the plight of the poor priest and his wife and children. 

And if | did not hope that E. A. would not take a hard stand on this, | would perhaps not have undertaken to ask such a thing. | also hope that E. A. will not refuse me this request, if | think that E. A. has given so much to a common box here, as it is much more generous here, because it is more necessary. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen.

Grace and peace in Christ and my poor pater noster. Most noble, highborn prince, most gracious lord! To E. C. F. G.'s writing, received by me yesterday, in which E. C. F. G., stating how they cannot know whether my most gracious wife has done such writing with my knowledge or concern, or whether she intends to move to Lichtenberg, 2c., | humbly reply to E. C. F. G. that | truly knew nothing of her C. F. G. letter. For now a while ago | have noticed that letters and messengers have run, but | have not known to whom or where. Likewise, nothing has been reported to me about the move to Lichtenberg, except that there has been a rumor in the house 3) as if Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg together with his spouse (who was recently in Roslau), Margrave Hans and the Princess of Anhalt were to come to my most gracious wives in Lichtenberg. Such delusion is now strengthened by Philipp's arrival full of Lichtenberg (whom | thought was ordered by E. C. F. G. to keep house in Lichtenberg), to whom, as therefore called (as | hear it said), likewise keeping house is ordered by my most gracious wives; but | know nothing for certain; to which it added that at the same time the game, so E. C. F. G. sent to her C. F. G., was quickly sent to Lichtenberg, so that | thought that such a gift and meeting would take place there, and the next day my g. | could not think of anything else, because E. C. F.G. would have granted or ordered such a thing for reasons, because it is a wonder how reluctant one is here. And, as E. C. F. G. write to me that | should advise that the good Princess stay here for a while longer, | do so not only justly, but also gladly, because | do not yet know of anything better to advise, based on my loyalty. But | fear that | will not be able to hold the eel by the tail in the end, so it struggles and pushes to turn out; | do not know what causes it, because | would dream of it while awake or would have dreamed of it.

Our greeting before. Venerable and Reverend, dear devotee! We have received your reply to our next letter to you, concerning our friendly dear wife, the Margravine Dowager, and her journey from Wittenberg to Lichtenberg, and have noted with gracious favor that you knew nothing of the writing which her beloved recently did to us, nor of her departure from Wittenberg. And we do not want to reassure you in your gracious opinion that we have not yet received an answer from her beloved about the situation of her son, our uncle and brother-in-law, Margrave Hansen, coming to her beloved in Wittenberg, and whether this is acceptable or not. But we are waiting for such an answer daily, and since such a meeting has reached its progress (furgang), as we undoubtedly want to provide for ourselves, since our lady, the Margravine, will be serious on account of Margrave Hansen, we are once again obliged and inclined to dispose of the time to Wittenberg, and with his love, the Margravine's household, and for the sake of other troubles, before and before she goes to Lichtenberg again, to be friendly with her.

Therefore, it is our gracious request, if you will note that our Lady wanted to require Margrave Hansen, her son, to come to Wittenberg, that you will see to it that this is not postponed until after Christmas. For what we think about and do here is for the good of the pious princess. Since you yourselves know of nothing better to do, [than] that her beloved abstain from Wittenberg for a while, it is once again our gracious request that you, in accordance with our gracious letter, set it in motion with her beloved and work diligently, as you will know how to do, so that this will happen. But if, as we note, you do not want to be persecuted for a long time, but her beloved would rise to move to Lichtenberg, then we cannot help it, and must let it happen and put it there, because we have done our part and are thus excused. 

But that Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg together with his spouse, also Margrave Hans and the Princess of Anhalt are to come to the Margravine in Lichtenberg, as you have received, we have not heard anything about that before; what will therefore come to you further, you should report to us by your letter. 

Because we also understand from your letter how a desolate being is at Lichtenberg, and that the previous court shall be called together again, as you have been reported, so we are minded. He is to request J6rgen von Minkwitz to come here, and to talk to him thereupon 2) according to all necessity and for the best of the margravine. We have not wished to restrain you from doing so, and are inclined to you with grace and good. Date at Torgau, Sunday after Lucia [Dec. 16] 1537.

Should Johann von Walten, as collator of this fief, which has already been decreed for the entertainment of the servants of the divine word, be deprived of the same of his property, he shall be entitled to it.

Grace and peace in Christ! | write to the Preceptor, Mr. Wolfgang ReiBenbusch, best Vice-Chancellor, as | hope it pleases the most noble Prince and you. You throw the letters back to him or see to it that they are returned to him, but with the exception of the sum of 80 florins, which, as | have written, are to be given to the pastor at Prettin. | have always thought that the Preceptor is a good man, but | think that it is right and just that this poor priest, who has been affected by so much misfortune, should be comforted with this money. Other things verbally, because | intend to visit you Torgauers after the feast, certainly not for the sake of this matter, but also not in my own affairs; they are only partly mine. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me. On the fourth Sunday of Advent [23 Dec.] 1537. Yours, Martin Luther, D.

U. Greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee!

and we do not want any way to let the said Doctor Jonam come substantially from the University. However, since the people of Zerbst are not to havea pastor and preacher at this time, we have graciously consented to God for the praise and promotion of His word, and also to the kind favor of our neighbors from Anhalt, and especially because much rule will now come there, that Doctor Jonas may be used as a preacher there between here and Shrove Tuesday, with the avoidance that their lords may endeavor to find a pastor, for which we would gladly be of assistance to them. And therefore it is our gracious request, where our lords of Anhalt or those of Zerbst will apply to you for a pastor, that you be and appear conducive to them, so that they will be provided with a competent and skillful man. We, in our gracious opinion, do not want you to do this, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date Torgau, Thursday Johannis Evangelista [27 Dec.] 1538 [that is 1537].

Luther asks to send the writings prepared for M. Georg Rorer. About the sad condition of the margravine. 


From the original printed in the library at Helmstadt in Bruns, Beitrage, p. 104 and in De Wette- Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 445. 

To the highly respected man, Mr. Franz, Vice 

Chancellor of Saxony, his extremely dear godfather and friend. 

Dear Mr. Vice Chancellor! You may see to it that you redeem your faith, hope and love, because D. Brick says that the writings for M. Georg Rérer have long been taken care of, but it is your fault that they are not sent to the so distressed, and one expects 2c. Therefore, show us mercy for the sake of God. 

| am not writing anything about the most illustrious Lady Margravine, because | did not want to be the writer of such sad things. God have mercy on the very good and holy woman. And let us all pray for her. It is God's quite unfathomable counsel that He allows such things of Satan in our midst.

To Johann Bugenhagen. 


This letter does not contain anything personal, but advice and regulations for someone who has been called to an embassy (legationem); and deals with the way how the Old Testament, especially the passage Habakuk 2, 4. is to be interpreted. 


From an old manuscript in Schelhorns Erg@tzlichk., vol. |, p. 297; from the Schelhorn collection in Memmingen in Schutze, vol. Ill, p. 236 and (comparing Cod. Goth. 402. f.) in De Wette, vol. V, p. 89 f. 

Grace, mercy and peace in the Lord! First, what | believe must be done, indeed, what | declare to be quite certain according to the testimony of God, that he should not doubt that he is called by God to this message (/egationem) or work, which is exceedingly pleasing to God and necessary for the churches and salutary for many consciences, which he who has begun and will accomplish what he is doing will also bless and confirm. Second, that he may rejoice in the Lord with all his heart, and not doubt that he is surrounded by legions of angels, so much so that even if he were alone, he should know that he is not alone. Thirdly, when he has realized that it was Satan, still is, and that it will be Satan, he should not be surprised, but know that Satan is Satan, because the one who is in us is greater than the one who is in the world. For in such a great work of God, Satan cannot be absent, who has always been a rebel and a prankster even in heaven, in paradise, in the church. He has other things without me from God the Father through Jesus Christ. 

But from me [he may accept], if it pleases him: First, that he should not reconcile the pope and Luther. Second, that he should not let himself be persuaded that the Concilium at Mantua is a serious one. Thirdly, that he should not believe that the executioner at Halle is a good man, nor teach this. For the rest, | promise my work, my prayers, my diligence and whatever | am able to do, so that we may carry the work with one another and do and promote this work of the Lord together.

Lautes and Munster and other Hebrew grammarians have worked faithfully and are worthy of all thanks, but in opinion they follow the rabbis too closely. For grammar is not enough to understand the Scriptures. Grammar is something different from the Hebrew language, just as Greek and Latin grammar do not make Greeks and Latins. But the Hebrew language, then also the sure (positiva) grammar, has largely perished among the Jews; it has fallen away along with the matter and its understanding, as Isaiah says, Cap. 29, 10. ff. Therefore, nothing is to be conceded to the rabbis jn the interpretation of the sacred Scriptures (in re sacra), since they twist and force the word derivations and word insertions, because they want to force the matter out of the words, and subject the matter to the words, although the matters must not be subservient to the words, but the words to the matters. But after the matter is lost, the words are twisted in vain, which is the only work of the rabbis, but one that goes to the extreme. Indeed, they are wont to falsify a clear passage, where even the grammar agrees with us, only out of hatred against Christ, and to refer it to remote things, which is easily proved from the fact that the newer Jews treat in a fabulous manner many passages which their old masters treat correctly and according to the truth, and do so at length and with great erudition. Burgensis testifies to this everywhere in the postilion on Lyra and in his Scrutinium. The same testifies Lyra himself. And in all things their endeavor is like that which was in our lines, that after the understanding of Scripture was lost, they imputed their imaginations and preconceived opinions to the words of Scripture, twisting with great violence even the clear passages to the opposite opinion, as even now both they themselves and all heretics do. Therefore, if one has to accept grammatical things from them, one may accept them, but all their word derivations or opinions must not be followed in any way, since we know that they are very eager to twist the words by grammatical rules and to falsify the right opinions. You 


Today, too, you see how much those who strive to be considered pure as Latinists reject the pursuit of word derivations and grammatical rules; they want that not the rules but the usage is the master of speech and the purpose of word derivations and rules that keeps the right measure. Hence comes the dispute between the Ciceronians and the other Latins who take a different position. And I, who am neither a Latinist nor a grammarian, much less a Ciceronian, nevertheless applaud most those who appear as Ciceronians and want to be praised. So also in the holy Scriptures | would rather be a Mosaic, a Davidic or an Isaic ina pure way, if it were possible, than a Kimchic (Kumichius) Hebrew or a Hebrew equal to any other rabbi. For we must strive to come as close as we can to the most distinguished in any profession and become like them, since with them there is not only a pure manner of speech, but also the right understanding of things. People of pleasure are talking, 1) that in the passage Habakkuk 2,4. it is not written: "The righteous will live by his faith", but: by the truth, and are ready to deny and condemn the right opinion of faith, if they would not be prevented from it by the translation of the apostle Paul [Rom. 1, 17.]. But just by this they show their ignorance in the holy words and things. For who should not know that none actually corresponds to this word "faith" in the Hebrew? But they have another, namely Emeth, Emunah (truth), to which, however, again with us, either Greeks, or Latins, or Germans, no word corresponds. For "truth" denotes with them that which is firm, certain, stable, firmly established, undoubted, and it is said of bodily and spiritual things, as the 89th Psalm [v. 38] testifies: "certain in the clouds" (Vulg.: in coelo fidelis), that is: certain, firm, stable, since it speaks of the rainbow 2) of Noah. Is. 7, 9. He connects both by a play on words: xxxxx XX XX XXXXX XX XX,

which is translated: si non creditis, 


non| Things, because faith produces a firm, certain, true, 


permanebitis, "do not believe, do not remain". But it} stable and well-founded opinion of the heart, which 


is the same verbum all changed by the derivation (etymologia). According to the grammar, mau might translate thus: if you will not stand, be certain, firm, true, you will not be standing, certain, firm, true people; or thus: if you do not believe, one. will not believe you. The one therefore refers to spiritual things, the other to bodily, in this way: If you do not stand firm in your heart, you will not be firm and certain in your mind; if you doubt in your mind, if you are not true in your mind, if you do not have the right will, you will not be able to stand and remain, be anything true, firm or constant, but just as you waver in your mind and are nothing certain in your heart, so you will also waver and be nothing certain in your kingdom. Now if you understand here what we have called firmness, certainty of heart, truth, constancy of mind, in relation to spiritual things, namely, of the word of God, namely, that | should have a firm, certain, constant applause to the word of God: Dear, by what name wilt thou teach me to express it in Latin? Will you not say: It is quite the same thing that in Latin is called fidere, to believe, to have confidence, not to doubt? What, therefore, is one to do? You deny that in Habakkuk "faith" must be read, only because you deny that in him "truth" is read, since in Hebrew faith and truth are the same. And also in Latin truth is not much different from faith, may one 


does not waver, does not doubt, is not vain, is not false and is nothing in the heart or a deceptive image or mockery without reality or truth, as there are the opinions of men of God, none of which has a reason or is a true, certain, firm thing; but it is a wavering, unstable, indefinite image in the heart. Otherwise the same [faith] is also called truth, in Hebrew Necona, Ps. 5,10.: "For in their mouth is not that which is called, nothing certain, firm, lasting, well-founded, being (hypostaticum), but everything is deceitful, vain, doubtful, which in truth is the same as being nothing, not existing, not being a being (hypostasin). Hence in the 51st Psalm [v. 12. Vulg.] it is said, "a right (rectum) spirit," that is, a true, certain, undoubted, firm, well-grounded, _ substantial (existent), not deceitful, fictitious, doubtful, indefinite; "a spirit which is a right spirit, not a painted, poetical spirit, for it is false and not a true spirit," but a kind of thought and fancy of the flesh. Therefore, when mau says, "The righteous lives by the truth," it is the same as: he lives by what is certain, not by what is doubtful, or void, invented, false, but by the firm, true, constant heart with which he clings to the word of GOD, which Paul translated: through faith", admittedly with knowledge and will, because faith is the foundation (hypostasis), the steadfastness, the truth of the 


speak of the mind or of the body. The word] heart, which adheres in truth, steadfastly and well- researchers (etymologi) say that it is called fides|foundedly to the word of GOD, not deceitfully or because it happens (fiat) or fei, that is, it is the truth] voidly, which is usually called the joy of faith for things outwardly, which is made known inwardly by} (p/erophoriam). But philosophy has deceived us with the word of the heart, outwardly by the word of the] this word hypostasis, which uses it for essence mouth. Furthermore, since Hebr. 11, 1. explains the] (substantia), referring to the false, the vain, the void, Hebrew word as it were by a definition in anjthe uncertain. So also of the divine persons exceedingly learned manner, he ninth the faith the} hypostases are said, that is, not such as are either foundation (hypostasin) or the — essence! void or false, but true, stable, well-founded, and (substantium) 1) of the things to come.

dete things. Now the word is easily understood [Hebr. 11, 1.]: hypostasis rerum spe. 

randarum its solid foundation of things to be hoped for, if one first rejects the opinion of philosophy and takes it according to the word of God, in which things to be hoped for (since they are nothing) cannot be received unless they are presented by the word, whether by the true one, as there is God's word, or by a false one, as there is the word of men. Then, that the solid foundation (hypostasin) of things is not understood in a philosophical way or formaliter, as if the future things had _ their substantiality (substantiam) from faith, and faith is the formal, the essential part of the things to be hoped for. Thus, life is the solid foundation (hypostasis) of the living body, but according to the way of the Hebrew and the Scriptures, that there is a certain confidence (hypostasis) of the things or 

of the things, which sees and grasps the things 1) itself in undoubted and certain opinion. This is "the faith" in the word of God, which does not lie, and the faith in the same does not deceive. 


No. 2407. (Wittenberg.) 3.) January 1538. M.. Georg Karg to Luther. (Regest.) 


He explains his inclination to be instructed. He would have liked to have written down his opinion in several articles to Luther, which Luther had demanded of him, but because a whole series of points came into question, the time was too short for him. A personal instruction of Luther was the most suitable. Now, putting all the blame on Jakob Schenk, whom he had asked urgently, but in vain, for instruction, he asks Luther to give him further instruction. 


From the Weimar archive in Seidemann, "Dr. Jacob Schenk," p. 164. A regest in Kolde, Analecta, p. 318. 


1) It seems to us that instead of res jpsa should be read: res ipsas; after that we have translated. 

2) Seidemann dates: "the 2nd or 3rd of January", but the 3rd of January is to be put, because Luther writes in the next letter of the 4th of January: "yesterday | sent to him in my name the two Caplan", namely, as we see from our letter, M. Georg Rérer and M. Sebastian Fréschel.

G. and F. in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! According to E. C. F. G.'s order, | quickly held out the notes to Mag. George Karg in the Sacristy 3) in the morning, in the presence of D. Jonas, D. Kreuziger, M. Philipps, and talked to him sharply: whereupon he first wanted to apologize, as if he had not written such a thing, but quickly referred to it, said that he had always wanted to be instructed, and we ordered him to briefly send us his opinion in writing, whereupon he wanted to stay, which he granted. Just in such speeches comes the Schésser, 4) and E. C. F. G.'s order, he takes his hand to the castle to be knitted; however, we would have liked to see him knitted in his inn, which the castle had done on our responsibility; but the bailiff soon after had him brought to the castle, which we now like better, also on our part. 

When it now turned out that Mag. George Karg did not write anything, | sent the two chaplains to him yesterday in my name, so that they demanded from him the promised writing, and although the bailiff at first refused them, and would not let anyone come to him without E. C. F. G.'s order, he nevertheless considered it, let them come back, and they did.

They brought me this inserted document, which he subsequently sent to me. 

Today | went to him myself with D. Jonas, and talked to him at his request, and found that the priest, of whom he reports in his writings, has been one of the right principal boys, and that great injustice has been done to him. That they have let him come to Freiberg, that disturbs me greatly; for he has moved the poor young man to dispute such articles, which | have never read before, nor heard; but we hope, because he let himself be finely instructed today, and confesses that he was led astray in such doubts, 1) he should convert himself rightly. For he is an inexperienced young man, and may have first been offended by our persons, and then held the doctrine in all the more contemptible esteem, as they have all done up to now, who have caused trouble under our doctrine, and first despised our persons. But so that we do not make a joke out of the devil's accusation and strange request, | do not wish nor ask that C.F.G. release him until we may thoroughly and certainly show C.F.G. what he wants to do or not do; for strange thoughts occur to me, even about people who are perhaps, and whether God wills it, innocent. E. C. F. G. will know how to keep themselves princely. The devil is serious about us, and sends his servants among us (as the priest of Freiberg was one), and sneaks in, not greeting us.

Grace and peace in Christ! | am finally sending you myself, because (as you write) someone else is not sending them, the theses of the third and fourth disputation, my dear Franz. For you said that you had those of the first and second, and | am surprised, since everything else is so diligently carried to the court, that they also do not omit a flea bite, that they do not report these all-known things. Next Saturday [Jan. 12] 1) | will disput the second disputation, to hear again, if they want, these antinomians. 

From Freiberg everything is written about Jacob 2) so constantly that | myself am forced to believe what | believe only with sorrow. "The light will bring everything to light. | have not yet written about Magister Karg to the most noble prince, because he seems to be curable and eagerly accepts the rebukes, and that is a sign that the man is miserably deceived.

| have been so worried about the second corridor 2c., in writing, as E. F. G, that | should have written a consolation letter to E. F. G. a long time ago. But it is prevented until now, without my fate and will. Well, gone is gone! But now that our dear Father in heaven, who made us and gave us body and soul, and then redeemed us from Adam's error and death through His dear Son Jesus Christ, and through His Holy Spirit has given us the hope of eternal life, has fatherly visited us and burdened us with sickness, let us not worry, but accept such gracious visitation with gratitude. Because we are told and know that all who believe in the dear Son of the Father cannot die eternally, as He Himself says: "Whoever believes in Me will not die, and even if he dies, he still lives," John 11:25, and St. Paul. Rom. 14, 4) 8. Says, "We live or die, we are the Lord's." [V. 7:] "No one lives to himself, no one dies to himself," but to him alone who died for us all. Therefore we who believe in him should be confident, knowing that we are not our own, but are of him who died for us. If then we are sick, we are not sick to ourselves; 5) if we are well, we are not well to ourselves; if we are in trouble, we are not in trouble to ourselves; if we are happy, we are not happy to ourselves. In sum, whatever happens to us, it does not happen to us, but to him who died for us and became our own. Just as a pious child, when it is ill and suffers hardship, is more ill to its parents than to itself; for it affects the parents much more than the child, because the child is not its own, but the parents’. Therefore, let us also confidently surrender to the Lord, whether we live, suffer or die, and not doubt that the Lord does not repudiate such things to ourselves, but to Him who purchased the Lord together with us through His blood and death, in whom we also believe, and in such faith we do not die, though we die, but live, nor do we suffer, though we suffer, but live.

Both of you, the rulers and the commoners, use all your diligence, and ask on my account that you do not let her go away so miserable and poor, but do a tax for her for the sake of God. Dear God, do you want to deal with the poor widow in this way, where will you take preachers in time?

News from home, likewise about those from Italy. From the Archbishop of Mainz. 


Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 245 and in Cod. Goth. 4 Printed from the collection of Sagittarius at Jena by Schitze, vol. lll, p. 50 and by De Wette, vol. V, p. 100, 

Grace and peace in Christ! There was nothing | could have written, my dear Jonas, but to indicate to you that | would like to write more often, if it were either for the sake of business or because of Satan's angel and his fisticuffs. But here, too, there is no news that would be so important that it should be written to you, since you are in such a close place as an envoy. Your house is fine, thanks be to Christ, but your beer is spoiled if the same is in your cellar as the one you gave me as a gift. But the beer may spoil and at the same time the old man, the vessel or rather the hose of this water made a martyr, if only the incorruption of the inner man, who drinks the water and the living spring that quilts into eternal life, increases day by day, amen. 

Philip sends news from Italy. | draw from the same the hope that it will be 


1) Instead of corrumpitur we have assumed corrumpatur. 


that Christ, after the world has shattered itself among itself, will hasten his day and make the world shatter and collapse. The fearful may indeed be struck by the ruins, but we shall be granted imminent salvation, amen. 

It is said here, but | do not believe it, that ours have forgotten in their matter that that epicurer at Halle (since he killed Hans Schenitz disgracefully) had despised the restraining order of the empire, and that he now wants this restraining order to be upheld against our prince. This would clearly mean forgetting Cato's well-known saying: It is shameful for a teacher if the accusation falls back on him ( Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum). For if the order of the empire did not have validity against him then, why should it have validity for him now? But, as | have said, | do not believe that ours have forgotten this fraud, unless perhaps the honor is reserved for Luther, if he remains alive, to interpret this revelation (Apocalypsis), with due credit. If you have something certain about this matter, show it to me. For as | beseech God against this Pharaonic monster, so | hear nothing rather than God's judgment against him. For it resists and harms the Church greatly this vessel of wrath and sin, and | do not pray for him. 

Satan showed us our safety last Sunday, since God allowed it, and taught us that one must watch and live moderately. For he has caused a murder to be committed by a man who, being sober, was gentler than a lamb, but, being drunk, was a warrior. At times he has been a very hard-working and good wage- earner for my Kathe. May God have mercy on him and protect us against all temptations of Satan through Christ, our Lord, amen. Therefore, the rumor may come to you that he was the servant of Luther; so it was said in this city for a whole day. Of course, he fled after saying goodbye to his wife with tears, and left three children with their mother in great poverty. But may Satan be so with ours: Misery 


2226 


But woe to you, says that judge, who laugh, especially at the misfortunes of others; this comes to Satan and the Epicurer of Halle and his like. For this Herodian laughter and mockery Christ indeed understands, and has willed that we also understand it. Finally, they will weep after our sadness is turned into joy. Ina short while, if | can, more. For you, who are so joyful and calm in the rich peace of Christ (which | greatly wish for you), owe me ten more detailed letters, or rather a thousand. Fare well in the Lord. February 12, 1538. Your Martin Luther.

Grace and peace in Christ! | did not have time to write to several people now, my best and most dear Nicolaus. Therefore, | ask you first to thank the noble princes for the gift of the pike on my behalf, and then also to wish the prince, Mr. John, good luck in his reconciliation with his princess. May Christ confirm and accomplish the work he has begun with them, amen. Thanks be to him that he has so graciously heard our prayers in this matter. By this example we are taught that we must pray and not cease; he will surely come and save us. But, as | have said, now | am so occupied by some drudgeries of Satan that | cannot write a more. More at another time, when Christ gives it. Pray diligently to the Lord for me also, that | may do that which is good in his sight.

But the ungodliness of this matter and the unworthiness of these people is too great for one to be sufficiently indignant about it or to be able to talk it out with words. Christ Himself will come as judge; to Him the due vengeance must be reserved over these mockers of God and men. You pray for me, as | have asked you, for | have the confidence that your petitions are much appreciated by God. My Kathe greets you and M[eister] Peter 3) reverently in Christ. | wish that it may go well with you in the Lord.

God and peace in Christ. Most illustrious, highborn Prince, most gracious Lord! The Royal Majesty of Denmark has written to me to write for the present Hans Semler to E. C. F. G. and to ask that E. C. F. G. would show him gracious support, whether he could admonish his guilt, 1) as | understand that His Royal Majesty will also write to E. C. F. G.. Therefore, since my support is also desired for this purpose, my humble request is that 2) His Royal Highness would graciously show his support, [which,] as | have no doubt, they already know how to do and are happy to do out of a Christian and princely spirit.

For today | have already showered His Serene Highness with two other letters. | don't know what Herr Glatz may think; perhaps he will be persuaded by un 


1) Burkhardt remarks on the factual situation: J. Semler the A. was a deserving mining master, formerly in Danish, now in Saxon service, who had dug the famous "Semlerstollen" on the Schneeberg, and who asked for intercession that, considered "what he had suffered in the feud of the kings of Denmark, and what he was owed by the people under the counts of Mansfeld and Botho von Stollberg, may be paid". The requested letters of intercession bear the date of Tuesday after Estomihi [March 5, 1538], Thursday after Johannis Bapt [June 26] 1539. 

2) Omitted by Luther; Burkhardt added it. 


He may be so arrogant that he dares to challenge the agreement, which is confirmed by such strong witnesses and the proper authority, unless he is burdened by some sins of his past administration. You do, | ask, as much as you can, and as | have confidence, you will work so that the very good man of this Glatz does not suffer ridicule and harm.

Grace and peace in Christ! | will not compete with you, my dear Jonas, in writing letters, not without cause: First, because you far surpass us in intellect and eloquence, which, of course, are hereditary gifts; second, because you have richer material for writing, since you associate with such great heroes and affairs that | would almost like to think that the army of the Trojans and the Greeks were dull (frigidas) hosts before Troy, if Homer's poetry had not puffed them up and made such small things shine with immense eloquence.

Philip and | (while you are absent) are overwhelmed with things and business to the point of overflowing, while I, as an old man and a retired one, would rather enjoy the pleasure of old age in the garden these days, to look at the wonders of God in the growth of the trees, the flowers, the herbs, the birds 2c.., and this pleasure, even leisure, would be due to me if | had not deserved to be deprived of it by past sins, by burdensome and often useless business. Other things will tell this M. Johannes, the Saxon, my table companion, if | have written something too little, or you would like to know more, if it is otherwise the case that he could know more. In your house it stands well. The daughter of M. Philip, Hanna, is here from the salt works with her husband and children, who have traveled here because it is very comforting for a person to be able to enjoy the sacrament here. | have received the hope that also this tragedy will finally be concluded by a good end and will be a very good comedy, so that we can boast that it was a funny tragedy (tragicomoediam). Amen for the sake of Christ.

Consolation for the loss of his wife and newborn son. 


(Wittenberg.) 


From the collection of Caspar Sagittarius at Jena in Schutze, vol. Ill, p. 233. Comparing the Cod. chart. Goth. 402. 1. which has some severe omissions, and the Cod. Goth. 187. 4. in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 195. - This letter seems to us, at least in form, to be spurious. Already Seidemann remarks 1. e.: "With the contradictions, which all the pieces relating to Berndt's mourning present among each other, | cannot consider all doubts removed. - The time determination by Seidemann: "After May 1, 1538 (?)", which is based on the time when Berndt's youngest son died (Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 591, No. 1729), we have left with a question mark, because according to Cruciger's letter to Veit Dietrich of Nov. 24, 1537 (Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 454, incorrectly resolved: Nov. 27), it seems certain to us that Berndt's wife died in November 1537, but in our document the death of the son is reported as having occurred at the same time. Bretschneider (Corp. Ref. , Ill, 872) places Melanchthon's letter of consolation to Berndt in the year 1539, and ibid., vol. IV, 736, even more erroneously in the year 1541. Wrampelmeier places Luther's consolation speeches to Berndt in the "Tagebuch uber Dr. Martin Luther, gefihrt von Cordatus", p. 145, in the year 1532, "since (as he says) all these colloquia fall about in the middle of the year 1532". Preger "Tischreden Luthers nach den Aufzeichnungen Schlaginhaufens" moves them p. XVI to January to March 1532. On November 27, 1538 (see No. 2479) Berndt married, in second marriage, Luther's niece, Magdalena Kaufmann. Cf. St. Louis ed. vol. XXII, 822; Rebenstock, tom. II, fol. 5; Bindeil, tom. Ill, p. 208; Cordatus, no. 615 sqq. and Schlaginhaufen, no. 129 and no. 145. We have omitted the pieces which Seidemann printed in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 189, as being addressed to Ambrosius Berndt in mid-November 1537, because they are table speeches (Cap. 26, §60), which do not even have the form of a letter, and most of which are already found in the 22nd volume of our edition. This piece, which also seems to us to be more of a speech than a letter, we share here after Seidemann in German translation. 


Mercy and peace! | am not so _ insensitive (inhumanus), my dear Ambrosius, that | should not know how much the death of Margaret pains you. For the godly and strong affection of the husband towards his wife is so great that it cannot easily be shaken off from the heart, and GOtte does not dislike this movement of sadness at all, if it is only moderate, so that he even approves of it, since he has implanted it himself. And | would not think you a human being, much less a good husband, if you immediately removed the sadness from the 


heart. But, my dear Ambrosius, | allow you this sorrow as far as it is not against the will of God. For it is necessary that a measure be finally set for sadness and sorrow. Therefore, you should think of yourself in this way: first, that you are miserable in this world, since your wife and son 1) have been torn away from you; nothing more bitter can happen to a person in private matters, especially since you had such a wife, who was endowed with unusual gifts, who was at your beck and call in all things, and who was also chaste and adorned with the best manners, and then, which is the greatest thing, who was able to delight your heart with sweet and Christian conversation and move it not a little. And | know for sure that you are not grieving more for any reason than because she was gentle and extremely suitable for your wife. Again, you must remember that you have become the most blessed person before God through this death of the woman, because she died in childbirth, that is, in her godly duty and her actual profession, with a steady mind and in firm trust in Christ, whom she often confessed when she was already passing away, by calling upon Christ alone and surrendering and offering herself completely to God. In addition, by an extraordinary miracle, graciously supported by God in such great suffering, she gave birth to your son John, who was baptized and buried together with his mother. You will diligently consider these two things among yourself, and keep bodily goods against spiritual goods, and conclude that the spiritual gifts are greater than the bodily ones. In this exercise thyself continually, and temper thy grief as much as thou canst. Comfort yourself with the word of God, the most excellent consolation. Learn also to give great thanks to God for the spiritual gifts granted to your wife Margaretha, asking at the same time our common Father to let you and all of us die in faith in Jesus Christ. Yours Mart. Luther. 


1) The woman did not die immediately in childbirth, but after being well for a month, was stricken with a disease that brought about her death. (Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 455.) The child died later (Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 591).

From Faber's collection of letters, p. Il, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 106 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 199. 

Grace and peace in Christ and my poor Father- Our. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! | have been able to write to E. F. G. Hans von Bora, 1) my brother-in-law, who was previously E. F. G.'s servant on the Muemel (Memel). After he had been held up for a long time outside, for the sake of his property, that he also had to move into it himself, and compared himself, until he brought it to himself, nevertheless, he has never yet gone to E. F. G.'s service, but has always thought of E. F. G. with high praise, and desired E. F. G. to be his servant. with high praise, and wished to serve it always willingly and gladly: therefore asks E. F. G. not to understand such delay, which he had to do out of necessity to confirm his and his brothers’ goodwill, in any ungracious will, nor to recognize [him] as an ingrate or unwilling to serve E. F. G.. For | can testify with truth that he always praised E. F. G. very highly and considered him a dear gentleman before all others. 

Where now E. F. G. (after he has provided for his child the estate and poor inheritance or house, and can also order it) wants to use his service further, he begs to serve E. F. G. with all loyalty and diligence, and desires that E. F. G. be his gracious prince and lord. My humble request is also based on this. 


1) He excused himself in a letter dated Wittenberg, April 29, and offered to return to Prussia with his family if the Duke would take him back into his service. On May 24, the Duke replied that Bora's position had already been filled and that no other vacancy existed, but that he was prepared to provide for his continuation if he wished to return to Prussia.

New newspaper from the Turk eight | E. F. G. should know more than we do. The king 2) has no luck, the emperor is back in Hispania; some think he is angry that the pope so shamefully shows up the Concilium, consumes, scares and flies. They are nothing but Roman scoundrels and knaves; but God has begun to afflict them, and he will not let up, but presses on, making fools of them in their cleverness the longer. 

With the Swiss, who until now have been at odds with us because of the Sacrament, things are on a good track, God help us; for Basel, Strasbourg, Augsburg and Bern, along with others, are very friendly with us; So we also accept it kindly, that | hope God will put an end to the trouble, not for our sake, who do not deserve it, but for the sake of His name, and to the displeasure of the abomination at Rome; for they are terrified of such a new newspaper, and are afraid, which is why they also shun the Concilium so miserably.

sten, my dearest Doctor, or to anyone at court, that | had despised this rich gift of Franconian wine [, you will excuse me]. 1) | confess my guilt and am aware that | uttered words when this gift came, it seemed to me [, that it was not worth much], 1) because it would be Franconian wine, which is so infamous with us, either through the unworthiness of the sellers or the carters, through whom almost no unadulterated or wholesome wine is brought to us. Yes, | would have wished that no drop of Franconian wine would be given to me, since | was certain that | would not enjoy this drink. Therefore, if something like this will be told about me, | ask you to kindly excuse me as much as you can. Perhaps those will tell too true (narrabunt), who tell such things (narrant), but | have been by far the greatest fool (narrator), and even gross fool (narrus), since | did not know that you Franconians are blessed with such a good wine, when otherwise in other parts of Franconia one has such a wine. For immediately after | had tasted it and tried it for a few days, | sang the revocation and still sing it. For | have never drunk wine that would have been more beneficial or wholesome for my body than this cloudy one from this year, which | considered particularly suspicious. In the meantime | have despised all wines before that one and have refreshed myself with this one. | write this so that you may graciously excuse my ingratitude, which | condemn and detest by this letter; for this | ask you very much. As for the rest, | will not believe those who are hostile to Franconian wine in all things, unless | first know from experience what it is like to drink it. Fare well in your Lord and greet all of yours, but especially commend me to your most noble prince, and say thank you to his Serene Highness in my name, after you have excused my ingratitude.

To Edward Fox, Bishop of Herefordshire. 


On the occasion of the journey of the chancellor Burkhard and the superintendent Myconius as envoys of the Elector to England, Luther renewed his friendship with the bishop, who was with the English legation in Wittenberg in 1536. 


The original is in the library at Wolfenbittel; from there in De Wette, vol. V, p. 110. From the Borner collection at Leipzig in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 70. 


To the venerable Father in Christ, Mr. Edward, Bishop of Hereford (Erfordiensi) in England, his superior to be revered in your Lord. 


Grace and peace in Christ our Lord! When these men, our friends and the envoys of the princes, set out on their journey to your most noble king, |, venerable Lord, could not refrain from writing a letter to you, fearing that | would be highly reproached for being an ungrateful and unfeeling person. For, since you, in addition to the exceedingly sweet intercourse that you have cultivated with us here, have also done me a great deal of good and have helped me with advice against my enemy, the stone, there is no occasion for me to forget you. We have often spoken of you and at great length, especially since, because affairs in your kingdom are so changeable, you have either been unable to write letters to us, or those that have been written have perhaps been intercepted, with which we might have satisfied our longing. For we were in uncertainty, and indeed feared that this hard 





The stubborn silence might have been the sign of a very sad accident that would have befallen the Gospel. And there were people who were saying that your king, finally entangled by the Roman intrigues, would again enter into a good understanding with the pope. Here we prayed and wished with hope and fear that Satan would be crushed under your feet. We are not yet sure what or how you will act in the Gospel. But we hope to hear through these envoys, when they return, happy news and a true gospel about your English church. But how it stands with the church and the commonwealth in our Germany, you will be able to learn abundantly and completely from these people of ours. May the Lord Jesus Christ increase in you and us at the same time His grace and gifts to the glory of God the Father, amen. Venerable Lord, my daughter greets you reverently. In Christ, your dignities are quite at ease, and let me be in command of her. On the 12th day of May, Anno 1538. E. W. most devoted Martin Luther.

To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich. 


Answer to Letter No. 2425, with which Bullinger had sent his writing De autoritate Scripturae et functione Episcoporum. Luther does not hide the fact that he cannot agree with Bullinger's opinions and wishes that they and their parties would still come to an agreement. 


The original is in the Zurich government archives, but the beginning is missing, and it only begins with Nosti vero. Printed by Hottinger, Hist. Eccl., V|, 730 and from it by Strobel-Ranner, p. 268. According to the original by De Wette, Vol. V, p. 111. 


To the highly placed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the industrious and diligent servant of the church in Zurich, his dear [friend] highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Your letter has been 

handed over to me, my dear Bullinger, at the same time as your book on the reputation of the

Scripture and the administration of the bishops. Of course, | have not yet read through the book, since | am busy with other and many things; however, | did not want to postpone the answer beyond this Leipzig fair, although | cannot indicate what you desire, my judgment about your book, with such a great lack of time. You know, however, that otherwise we do not dislike the way of writing and the content of the things you deal with, but we are different in our opinion and attitude. | will say it freely: after | saw and heard Zwingli in Marburg, | thought that he was a very good man, as was Oecolampad, so that your accident almost deprived me of life, for no reason more than because | was forced to believe that he was a stranger to our opinion, or rather that he remained a stranger to it, which we consider no less true than you do yours. And that also hurt me, that afterwards you praised and published under your name the book that Zwingli wrote to King Christian with extraordinary praise, even though you knew that there were very many things in this book that are not only annoying to us, but with the greatest right to all godly people; not as if | were envious of Zwingli's honor, over whose death | felt such great pain, but because the integrity of doctrine must not be disregarded for the sake of any man. | write this so that you may see that | am dealing with you in right sincerity without all hypocrisy. You may think that we are mistaken; this | commend to God's courts. Certainly, even we cannot approve all that is yours, if we did not want to burden our conscience; you will not ask that of us, as | do not doubt. But before my departure, nothing could be more joyful to me than if, at last, by the grace of God, the Spirit were given to refresh my heart and soul in the Lord, so that we might keep and speak one accord in Christ for the glory of God the Father and the salvation of souls. Meanwhile, take this for the best, until, God willing, | have read your booklet. Fare well. Wittenberg, May 14, 1538.

To Sebastian Heller, Ansbach Chancellor. 


Recommendation of a young clergyman. 


From the original in the Imhof Collection in Nuremberg in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 71 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 112. From Strobel's Melanchthoniana in Corp. Ref. vol. Ill, 526. Bretschneider claims that "according to the way of writing" Melanchthon is to be regarded as the author. 

To the highly respected man, Mr. Sebastian Heller, the Right Doctor and Chancellor of Margrave George of Ansbach. 

Dear Lord Chancellor! | hear that Sebastian Stibarus of Schwabach is known to you. Since he was here recently, he has offered us his work if he should be called to lead any church. He is, however, of good and gentle character, and his age is already suitable for public office. Although he has devoted himself primarily to the Holy Scriptures, he is also well educated in common _ philosophical doctrine. However, | believe that those who are distinguished by scholarship are more yielding and have a more sound judgment 1) [than others]. He has a modest and chaste wife. Therefore, since he is still in need of a job, | ask very much that you take him into consideration if there will be an opportunity. | see that he has to struggle with difficulties in housekeeping. | therefore ask that you let this righteous person, who can be of use to the community, be commanded to you. Be well and happy. On the 18th day of May, Anno 1538, your Mart. Luther.

Grace and peace in Christ! | am surprised that my letter was handed over to you so late, my dear Jonas, or that you answered so late. But let it be done what it can, for the convenience of the princes. | hope that | can appear on the appointed day and place, by the power of Christ, if the holiday (sabbathum) of the stone and the fist of Satan so continue. 

That of the Turk is more the truth than we would like to believe. And the voice of blood cries out, and the voice of Rabsake cries out, the voice of the oppressed cries out against Germany. Ferdinand has blood-stained hands, hearing the blasphemies of the bishops and the hostilities of the recognized truth. Who will have mercy on those who irritate God and knowingly worship lies? But Christ will be mindful of His poor and will finally show His power against the exceedingly hopeful and cruel enemy, the Mahomet (Mahumeten), Amen. Greetings to the most noble princes. | will speak orally about the future preacher in Zerbst; | have several names. About Weller | cannot say anything with certainty (statuere).

To Georg and Joachim, Princes of Anhalt. 


Luther reports that he cannot come to the princes today, but is willing to come at another time. 

First printed in 1830, after the original, in Lindner's "Mittheilungen," Il, p. 46; in the Erl. Ausg.) Vol. 56, p. 210 and in De Wette-Seidemann, Vol. VI, p. 197. 

To the noble, highborn princes and lords, Mr. Georgen, provost of Magdeburg, and Mr. Joachim, brothers, princes of Anhalt, counts of Ascanien and lords of Bernburg, my gracious lords. 

God and peace in Christ. Sublime, high-born 

princes, gracious lords! Because 


it might not have been that | would have come to E. F. G. today, in the middle of the week, so let it happen when it will be convenient for E. F. G., but that it will not happen on Monday, Tuesday 2c., when | must be here and work, because God gives me strength; for without that | am uncertain and must miss and celebrate more than is dear to me, as | have written to D.

About Luther's journey to Anhalt. 


From Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 252, in Schutze, vol. Ill, p. 73 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 114. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | beg you, my dear Jonas, to answer as soon as possible in which part of the world you are staying, for | dream that you are perhaps in Dessau, still at the fourth - what | know from a certain dream - milestone; so the letters that have been sent to each other confuse me. For to the one | received today, | believe | answered yesterday sufficiently, as also happened once before; | do not know whether the blame lies with the intervening woods. Now | answer again (if this answer also reaches you differently, before you again change elsewhere) that | am ready to please the worthy princes, at which place and day they want. | believe you will understand when the letter is delivered. 

Many and great things are said here about the Turk, which perhaps would like to prove that everything is false, and that this campaign under the fictitious name of the Turk is equipped against the Lutherans. But in the meantime we are going to ruin, since we have neither believed nor do we believe. May Christ come soon, amen. Fare well in the Lord. On Friday after Cantate s24. May) Anno 1538.

Grace and peace in the Lord to all pious Christians and friends in Christ! To these good people, He Franciscum, who are coming to Germany from distant lands, | ask that every one of you, whom he is going to visit, have commanded and appear helpful to him. 

For we are almost overloaded here in Wittenberg, and more than our poverty is able to provide, are visited by many both expelled and otherwise good people, who would like to study, for help, and do not find so much here, as they, according to the great name, would have provided, that more arid surrounding neighbors, who are spared with such daily burden, should also do help and tax. Who knows how God will protect us and greet us, and what He may want to make of such people?

This is the word which shall be the judge's daily sentence, and | believe it to be yours; for such a pious and Christian judge are you, as all who have known you before testify. Thank you, my dear Antoni judex, that you have been helpful to Margaretha Dorsten, and that you have not let the noble Hansen take away the poor woman's property and blood. You know that Doctor Martinus is not only a theologian and defender of the faith, but also an advocate of the right of poor people who flee to him from all places and ends. It is his aim to obtain help and intercession from him to the authorities, so that he would have enough to do with it, if there were no other work pressing on his shoulders. But Doctor Martinus serves the poor gladly, as you are accustomed to do; for you fear God the Lord, love Jesus Christ, search the Scriptures and God's Word, and still learn your catechism daily as well as the children in your school. The Lord Christ will remember you again. But, dear Judge Antoni, was it not enough that you heard my plea and intercession, and gave me a comforting report of your love and willingness? Did you also have to live in remembrance of me with a gift? and even with a whole tank of Torg's beer, your brew. | am not worthy of the good deed, and even though | know that you are not poor, but that God has blessed you with goods and abundance, | would have preferred that you had given the beer to your poor, who with their prayers would have given you more....

About the occupation of the superintendency at Freiberg. 


The concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, p. 100. 37. 6. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 304. 

Johans Friedrich. Ujlnsern] GjruB] before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee ! We graciously inform you that Doctor Jacobus Schenck came to us yesterday from Freiberg towards Weimar upon our description, and wants to be used as a preacher at our court, as he has also obtained his farewell at Freiberg. Now you know what the also highly learned councilor and dear faithful one, Gregorius Brick, Doctor, by virtue of Doctor Jacobus and the further appointment for the sake of the Superattendence at Freiberg, talked to you from our order, and you let yourselves be heard on it. Although, as we note, he should have a good will and hearing with our cousin, Duke Heinrich of Saxony, and also with the common people of Freiberg, we nevertheless consider, for all sorts of reasons, that he should not be commanded to the superintendence of the place. For this reason, we have appointed the pastor of Zwickau to preach there for a while and to administer the superintendence. - However, because we understand from the said Doctor Brick that you should not be ordered to preach there for a while, since he will be with you on 





We have, by our order, appointed one called Wendelen to such an office, who is said to have been Count Gebhard's of Mansfeld's court preacher: If the same would be skilled and suitable for this, we graciously request that you write to him favorably, and propose such a condition and service, and hear from him whether 1) he [wants] to go there against Freiberg, and what you therefore understand from him and what he will give you in reply, that you want to make known to us favorably, so that we may further act on this with our cousin, Duke Heinrich, and inform his love of it. We do not wish to hold you to this in your gracious opinion, and do us a gracious favor. Date Weimar, Tuesday after Visitationis Maria [July 9] 1538. 


No. 2450. (K6nigsberg.) July 24, 1538. Duke Albrecht of Prussia to Luther. (Excerpt.) 


The duke wrote that Luther had attacked the Elector of Mainz too harshly in his writing against M. Simon Lemnius Epigrammata (St. Louis edition, vol. XIV, 762). 

Printed by Faber, PreuB. The excerpt given here is found in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 123, in Luther's answer to this letter. 


. .. For although it is sufficiently known that there may be all kinds of abuses in the supposed spiritual state, it is also known that there may be many faithful hearts that see such abuses, and even if they do not all immediately confess the Word completely and without distinction, it is still reasonable to have patience with them. - Should we not build more than we break? In my simplicity, it is highly to be considered that there are still other ways to meet an unskilled poet with more glimpses and modesty. So then, as reported above, my kind-hearted concern and confidence caused me to write, not only because |, like the truth, do not like to see the house of Brandenburg stirred, but rather would prefer that the divine word break through, and my dear father Martin's much, and all electoral and princely houses would be more weighed, and thus through the weightiness of the person also the salutary word would be so much more promoted: so my very Christian, high and diligent request, my dear father, is that the divine word should be more weighed.

Under this wrong heading and date, both De Wette, vol.

G. | add to know that the most illustrious and highborn prince and lord, Mr. Johanns Friederich, Elector, Duke of Saxony 2c., my most gracious lord, has written to me, and graciously desires, after the worthy and respectable Magister Niclaus Hausmann has been appointed to the Superattendentia of the Churches at Freiburg (Freyburgk) by an honorable council at Freiburg.

and vocirt is that | want to work diligently with E. F. G. and with M. Niclao, so that this vocatio will not be rejected. For even though S. C. F. G. would well consider that E. F. G. would not gladly let M. Niclaum go, they nevertheless hoped that E. F. G. would be willing in view of the great need of the churches at Freiburg and would gladly help to improve them and prevent many troubles out of a Christian spirit. Now | hear that the illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Lord Heinrich, Duke of Saxony, has also written to Magistrum Niclaum and summoned him, that Magister Niclaus also recognizes his duty to serve the church in his fatherland and is willing to do so as much as he can. Therefore, I, E. F. G., graciously ask Magistro Nicolao to allow him to follow such appointment and to go to Freiberg (sic) to serve the same church. For even though he serves usefully in the present appointment, E. F. G. themselves know that the necessity of the church is not to be ignored. themselves know that the need in Freiberg is greater, since the church has recently been brought to a better state and is still tender and needs a noble, sedate, experienced man who could maintain peace between the preachers, who also has a reputation and good will among the surrounding towns, as Magister Nicolaus in particular is known there and very much loved because of his Christian, sedate nature, so E. F. G. have undoubtedly heard that he is a good man. F. G. have undoubtedly heard that before this time there was a lot of disagreement between the preachers there. Should the church now stand without a noble superintendent, then E. F. G. can assume what trouble there is to worry about, which E. F. G. themselves are undoubtedly most inclined to prevent. Therefore, in view of the great need, the Foundation also wants to do its best, and for the preservation of the church in question, in honor of our Lord Christ, to promote and help; and if the Foundation desires another person to take the place of Magistrate Nicolai, | will make every effort to again indicate to the Foundation a pious, learned and sedentary preacher. For | am willing to serve E. F. G.. Date Wittenberg, Wednesday ultima Julyi anno 1538. E. F. G. willing Martinus Luther.

G. and peace in Christ. | cannot blame E. F. G. as a friend of blood for taking such a hard line against the bishop of Mainz, and for asking so warmly 2c., but lam just and well off. But | hope that when E. F. G. will read my reasons, they themselves will not think nor say much good of the bishop; for as he also let himself be found at Zerbst, in the action with the Elector of Saxony, E. F. G. can learn from the other princes of the noble house of Brandenburg, who were very badly pleased about him, and one said: Ah, that he were not Prince of Brandenburg! 2c. But how should one do it? He overpowers with malice and mischievousness, so that [it] must be obvious to everyone. No lineage has ever been so high and noble; sometimes an ill-bred child has come out of it, and the nobler the better. What boys have come out of the Staunn David! From the chosen apostles kain Judas, from the angels the devil, from the holy bishops the heretics. And where do whores and boys come from, but from pious parents 2c.? It is not a disgrace to have boys in a family, but honest that they are not praised nor defended. Therefore | humbly ask, E. F. G. to let the desperate priest be commanded to God's judgment; he wants it so, | do not want to do him wrong, or let him find me justified here 2c. 

In praise of God, the Sacrament is on a good course, | hope to achieve a happy Concordia at last in ashort time. Hiemit dein lieben GOtt befehlt, Amen. The Assumption of Mary [15 Aug.] 1538.

Venerable and highly learned, favorable, dear Doctor! We are well aware of what the Almighty God has mercifully and wonderfully done many years ago (may His divine grace grant even longer and always) with the illumination of the salvific preaching of the pure light of evangelical truth in this city of Augsburg, as in many other places, and has distinguished the light from the darkness in such a way that we hope that the majority (tail) of the churches here will be found on the path of divine truth. First of all, we give God eternal praise, honor and glory, and we thank your E., as an instrument and faithful planter, who has been chosen for this purpose from time immemorial. And even though we and the common city may have been held in unfair suspicion years ago, as if our church did not agree with the church at Wittenberg, perhaps more out of the instigation of the enemies of divine truth and unity, than out of the right reason of things, we have nevertheless been found on both sides in the same, right understanding of the Holy Scriptures, and even so, that by the grace of the Almighty, not only a fervent love, concord and brotherhood between your E., the church at Wittenberg and us in the word of the Lord, but also by common Christian estates and heads a faithful commitment to persevere in the evangelical truth has been made, as the Christian Concord, our printed church order and established understanding indicate. In this, we, praise God, have so far stood and remained firm with unanimous doctrine and church service, also performance, which is due according to the reported understanding, and, if God wills, want to remain unchanged. And where some of our preachers preached, wrote or spoke against this, we would neither permit nor impose it. And to further indicate that we have been and still are cordially well pleased with the Christian church in Wittenberg, we have written to your E. and Mr. Philippo Melanchthon in various years for a Christian, understanding servant in the Word of God, and have faithfully requested that he be assigned to us at our expense. Thereupon, undoubtedly out of a faithful, good mind, Master Johann Forster was sent to us, whom we also, as scholars and educated in so far famous Christian church, received and accepted with all joy, in the good hope that the disciple would follow the master with honorable conduct, Christian doctrine and morals without means, and work the Christian fruit in time. But as we have lived up to our hope 


God knows that we would much rather report the fact that we have or have not been idolized than to tell your story in so many words. However, since we have always and in all ways for our and the common city of Augsburg's Christian patron and promoter, and still, we cannot, out of special trust, refrain from having had a little patience and oversight with the appointed Master Johann Forster during the years and time of his service, from daily improvement with him, and also, as we have had the good fortune to show towards him, some of the things we have done, We have also refrained from such disparaging remarks as we might have had the right to make against him, in order to avoid and cut off such disparaging remarks as might have been made against this city before others, as if we were not in agreement with the Wittenberg church doctrine, in which doctrine we have always been very pleased, and therefore have preferred to appoint the Forster mentioned; But immediately in the beginning of his preaching ministry (we do not know, from his own or other people's movement) he took upon himself to bring all other of our preachers to a public recantation of false and erroneous doctrine, and to discuss it in the open pulpit, if it had not been confessed, much less overcome, which aroused not a little displeasure and annoyance in both his confreres, the preachers, and also the common people, in view of the fact that everyone, or the very best (very first) and most part, 1) in Christian, brotherly love and unity, had been quite content and unaccusatory after the expulsion of the Concord. We were also disconcerted that he, above all others, took it upon himself to strike at strange persons, presumably as attached to the papacy as to the Gospel, and to almost make a party, although this is to be unjudged by men further than the day lies. God wills, however, that Forster's and the persons mentioned's conduct be done out of Christian, good zeal, for to compare themselves with a few persons in such a way that they attend only one preaching and church service, and despise all the other preachers because of their person and their doctrine, will have little good reputation for us. Likewise, we are sufficiently informed that his conduct and life are found inappropriate for the parish office according to the teachings of Paul in many ways, with the loading of excess wine, quarrelsome, bitter words, and other things, he is probably called to the sick late or even after midnight.

and come, since he has not yet sobered up, but rather has been very 1) drunk and immodest. Your E. must understand what Christian consolation such a person may communicate to a person in mortal distress, and although his deficiencies have been sufficiently made clear to him in a humble and decent manner, no improvement has been felt in him, as he has also accepted the warning impatiently enough. For as our ordained church priests (indeed, according to the occasion of our city, honorable, select men) indicate to us, there has seldom been a meeting in which he did not engage in unnecessary bickering and brooding, not only against his fellow priests, but also against the prebendaries, The result was that a year ago, two of the church priests, handsome, intelligent people, no longer wanted to sit with him, but had renounced their office. And although we would have tolerated such a thing and the resulting annoyance with a heavy heart, and would have had more reason to change the forester than the reported church priests, we nevertheless hoped for improvement from him, and also worried about the unfounded clamor with which the repugnants tended to charge us before others, as if he would be abolished contrary to the church in Wittenberg, and again tolerated him longer. But the longer we watched and waited for improvement, the more he was able to abuse our patience. For beyond the fact that he himself has publicly confessed before the convention of church presbyters and preachers that a unanimous doctrine and church service of the Concord and our printed church order is here, and is definitely kept, he wants to provoke quarrels and discord, as it were, which is why he also sent a letter to one of our preachers, Master Me! Keller, the other day, and sent these notes 2) and questions, which are stored here, and, regardless of the fact that he hears them daily and may not accuse them of any repugnant doctrine, requests his own handwriting from him, which does not give a slight indication of his unbrotherly and hostile will. Now, our church provosts and preachers were recently assembled on Thursday [Aug. 15], almost all of them, up to 20 persons, before whom Master Michel reported Forster's request for the handwritten note, half a bit painfully, but, as the provosts and others say, modestly, talked about it and asked a question: whether ever from

had been taught to him in such a way or had been heard, so that he had given cause for such a request by Forster, and had also given an explanation of the articles prescribed by Forster, so that they were all well satisfied, and no one had anything against it; only Forster would have said, after Master Michel had finished speaking, that the said Master Michel had said, among other things, at that time, that the articles which Doctor Luther had recently let go out 3) were not in accordance with the Concord. But Master Michel did not confess to this, and called the whole assembly to witnesses, whether they had heard such from him or not, to say publicly; whereupon they all and each in particular said: they had not heard such speeches from Master Michel. But Forster would have said: it was spoken by him, and he would have written it out, would also be true; and what the church provosts and preachers all said against it, not once, but in many ways, all and in particular, and asked him, Forster, not to belittle them all in this way 2c., he finally insisted on it, and wanted to overcome them all to the untruth and punished them, thereby moving the named church priests, as requested and ordered by superiority for this purpose, so that they all appeared before us, and complained and complained to the highest degree of Forster's iniquity, as well as of the manifold quarrels and impropriety that had long since passed, with the indication that they should by no means continue to sit with him: They complained to the highest degree, indicating that they would by no means continue to sit with him, but would soon relinquish all their offices, because no improvement could ever be hoped for, but that they would have to worry about all the unpleasantness and inconsistency with him, because he often said something now, which he immediately denied again, and again wanted to accuse the people of their words and speeches in a different way than they had said. How burdensome and unpleasant it would be for us and the common city to see and allow, beyond our long patience, that a church leader, forgetting and neglecting good manners and the appurtenances of his office, should behave in such an indecent manner towards respectable, pious, pious people, who, by reason of their superiority, have been given the right to do so, especially in these times, when nothing more than brotherly love, peace and unity are needed in our town (which has many different kinds of people in it)., as he is highly Knowledgeable, can easily take into consideration. Therefore, and so that our church provost's office would remain unchanged in good order as before, peace, tranquility and harmony between other our provosts.

Since | cannot understand you well enough in the Sacrament trade, | ask you, my dear Michael, to explain your opinion to me freely and clearly with your handwriting: 

First, whether you hold and confess that the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper are truly and essentially the body and blood of the Lord, according to the words of Christ and the article of our Confession and Apology. 

Second, whether you hold and teach that in the Lord's Supper even the unworthy truly and substantially receive the body and blood of the Lord. 

Third, what people you think are the ones Paul calls unworthy.

To the honorable, prudent mayors and builders as ordered war and secret councilors of Augsburg, my favorable good friends. 

God and peace in Christ! What E. Ehrbarkeit and 

F. only wrote from Magister Johann Forster, | leave this time in its value; because | am not the judge of the things, so you will know well to keep your conscience, because | cannot nor will not defend him, where he would excuse himself. So order all this to his judge; but | have heard with a saddened mind that the accident by the devil has thus occurred between you. 

But | am highly complained about your writing. And where you yourselves or your preachers want to write or speak so much about Concordia, as your writing reports, then no good game should come of it; for | respect that no one can speak of Concordia with truth, nor will | suffer it. It is therefore my friendly request that you yourselves and your preachers refrain from such talk, and consider how this necessary poor Concordia has been kindled with great effort and work, cost and diligence by many people of high standing and learned people. Should the fire be blown up again, and the last become worse than the first, then you must answer for it from Augsburg, that | have warned you herewith quite faithfully, but for the sake of the unreasonable patience of the matter, | will first let it reach D. Capito and M. Butzer, whether they could or would act in this, before we cause the papists a new fool's delight. Yours Michel

Intercession for the Wittenberg student Sebastian Birnstiel because of a scholarship. 


The original is in the Coburg House and State Archives. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 311. 

Grace and peace in Christ and my poor prayer. Most noble, highborn prince, most gracious lord! There is a town child of Coburg, Sebastian Birnstil, who through my intercession has obtained from the council there a promise of the next fief to be granted, provided he has or would bring E. C. F. G. favor for it. Accordingly, a fief has now been discharged, therefore requests this my intercession to E. C. F. G.. Because he is a fine, skilful boy, already writes Latin very well, and can easily study what he is supposed to, in addition to being a poor orphan without parents, and having no other help, my humble request to E. C. F. G. is that he be graciously granted the favor for such a fief or scholarship, 1) so that he does not have to leave the studio because of armuths. E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously show themselves. Herewith your dear God commanded. Thursday after St. Bartholomew [Aug. 29] 1538. Mart. Luther. 


No. 2458. August 1538. To an unnamed person. 


(Unauthentic letter.) Under this heading and time determination, Seidemann brings in De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 205 an alleged letter, which, however, in fact is a somewhat modified letter. 


1) According to Reg. Ji, fol. 133B. 1538. C 7. 62 (in the Weimar archives), Johann Friedrich wrote on Sept. 2 to the visitators of Franconia that they should report to him whether there was still a fief or a prebend that had not been struck to the common caste (Burkhardt). 





This is the first table talk, which is found in the St. Louiser edition, vol. XXII, 1241. There (according to Seidemann) in line 12 of the second paragraph is to be read: "too good". In Seidemann I. c. Z. 11 of the text is to be read instead of: "Groll": "Georg".

Grace and peace in Christ! My dear Bernard, | will not resist your will if you want to try a shipwreck in marriage for the second time, but there are very many reasons with me, of which it seems to me that they must rightly move you that especially you do not marry for the second time. You know your weakness; then, after this second marriage, you will not be so popular with the people, because of the exceedingly evil people who are very ill-disposed against us in this region. 2) And those who are godly will not marry again. And those who are godly already have enough burdens to carry, so that it is not necessary for them to be burdened by your and similar things. But that moves me, that there is danger that you might find one like the one you lost, and | know your well-known leniency in the government of the household, which is exceedingly burdensome at this time, so that if | were a younger man, | would nevertheless, since | have experienced the wickedness of the world, if a queen were also offered to me after my Kathe, rather die than become a husband anew. Therefore, if you want to hear me, you will refrain from it, so that you do not burden yourself and us further. Farewell in Christ. The last of August 1538.

From the original in Cyprian's collection at Gotha in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 75 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 126. To the highly placed man, Philipp GluenspieB, citizen of Mansfeld, his brother who is extremely dear to the Lord. 


Grace and peace! It is to be marveled at, my dear Philip, with how great diligence everyone, both friends and relatives, concealed from me the passing away of your father-in-law, Johann Reinicke, my very good friend, in such a way that not only my brother Jakob Luther, but also my Kathe did not want to report anything to me, who was ill. Therefore | have learned very late 1) the passing away of such a great man and such a great friend. But | am glad that he has passed away so happily and godly; however, | bear this accident very unwillingly and with sadness, namely that we have lost such a man. | would comfort you if | did not know that you belong to the number of those of whom Paul writes [1 Thess. 4:13.), "Ye are not sorrowful as others which have no hope." Christ has given us a certain hope, who rather let the so godly man fall asleep so gently than die. It is only left that you, as the successor in the friendship of the father- in-law, should remember our mutual

Heinrich Bullinger to Luther. (Regest.) 

Answer to No. 2433: Bullinger thanks Luther for his letter and his friendly opinion of Zwingli and Oecolampad. He excuses the publication of Zwingli's writing "to King Christian", which Luther had noted with displeasure; he had not known that there was much in it that would rightly annoy all the godly. With reference to Augustine and Chrysostom, he tries to demonstrate Zwingli's orthodoxy. Finally, since Luther had said that he could not approve all of theirs, he asked Luther to indicate where the Swiss differed, so that any appearance of discord could be removed.

We are of the opinion that her husband, Bastian Grnn, has always kept herself honest, chaste and upright with her husband, Bastian Grnn, as befits and is due to a pious woman, and has done nothing against her honor all her life, and that it is again reported that her husband, Bastian Grin, has been suspected of adultery and adulterous behavior, namely that he broke into the window of the parlor at night with another wife, while she was lying in bed for six weeks, and wanted to accomplish his will and disorder with her, so we consider, since these writings only report of the conatu and intention of adultery, and yet such adulterium with the deed and the work did not happen, that through the pastors or in other ways diligence should be applied, so that Margaretha reconciled with her husband, forgive him such out of Christian love and accept him again. For although the 1) secular authorities are also guilty of punishing such vices in this case, as the reported Bastian Grin has already been punished with the dungeon, 2) the reported Margaretha, if she wants to act in a Christian manner, is still obliged to forgive her neighbor and her own husband and, as much as possible, to bring him back to repentance and correction, as Paul, the apostle, says to the Galatians in the 6th chapter: "If a man forgives his husband, he is obliged to forgive him. If a man is led astray by a fault, instruct him with a gentle spirit, and look to yourself, lest you also be led astray. But where the reported Margeritt does not want to forgive her husband Christianly, but per jura publica, prosequirir her right, the gentlemen jureconsulti will know how to judge in this.

To the honorable Mr. Cyriacus Gerich, pastor at Bernburg, Doctor of Theology, his extremely dear [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! If this mallet has been buried outside the churchyard, this may go with the other things. The custom of our church is that with him who stubbornly despised to have fellowship with us in life, even we, when he has died, have no fellowship, that is, "we let him be buried who and where one will", outside or inside the churchyard. "But we, with our disciples, do not go with him, nor sing to him, let them howl who bury him," according to the words, "Let the dead bury the dead." For the burial

Grace and peace in Christ! | write to you very seldom, my dear Jacob, and do not answer your letters as you might wish. But | hope that you will accept this in fairness and in order, since you know my manifold burden with business, work, weakness of age and temptations, and also because | think that my letters are not necessary for you, since you are otherwise already abundantly gifted by God, so that even in this exceedingly bad time, which is overwhelmed with so much ingratitude and contempt for the salvific word, you yourself can guide and comfort both yourself and all. But enough of that. By the way, two very good and learned brothers have come to us from Lower Germany, but we are overwhelmed with poor people everywhere, who are poor enough ourselves; nevertheless, we had decided to feed them both according to our means. But since they cannot be useful here because of the language, it seemed good to Philip that we send one of them back to you, if perhaps, as he thinks, there is a vacancy for a preacher, so that they are not forced to be idle, at the same time because you are rich, and the greatness of your riches can easily overflow onto their little poverty. If now the ingratitude of men has gained the upper hand among you so that you cannot maintain him until he is provided with a preaching office,

News. I, an exhausted old man, tired from so many labors, always and from day to day become young again, that is, new sects always arise for me, which a new youth would be necessary for me to resist. You will learn about the antinomians from these theses. If there were no reason to prove that we are the called and chosen ones to the kingdom of God, and in truth have the word of God, this one would be enough, that we are attacked by so many sects, which always rise up anew, some of them also of our origin, so that | may mention the papists and the special (privata) wars of Satan, also the contempt of the word among our people. But we are not better than the apostles and prophets, nor even than our Lord Himself. 

It is written for certain (constanter) that the Emperor, the French and the Venetians have united their fleets against the Turks, and that on the sea there is a happy beginning against such a great enemy. God grant blessing and prosperity, Ps. 20. 2) The Concilium moved to Vicenza has completely fallen away. And the pope at Rome leads a life of prosperity, and endeavors, rightly and wrongly, to enrich and elevate his own by bravely killing or eliminating with poison those whose goods his sons covet. Rome is incomparably worse than God could consider worthy of any allowance for reformation; the final wrath of God has come upon it. 

Greetings from my mistress Kathe, and from your little path, my daughter, little Margaretha, to whom you will find some righteous suitor after my death. | write nothing about me, except that you may pray for me, that the Lord may free me from the fists and thorns of Satan's angel, and give me a good hour according to his will, when | shall be delivered from this body (materia). The Lord be with you, and greet your mistress from me and our Kathe. On the Sunday after the Exaltation of the Cross [15 Sept.] 1538,

No. 2466 to 2469. 1273 We do not send him astray or let him sit there forever, but let him sit at the church door for three or four weeks, after which we can decide whether he will be near (for if he is serious, he will not let his bride sit any longer, and he will run to the end of the world). After that we practice 1 Cor. 7, 15: Si infidelis discedit, discedat. 

Non enim est frater vel soror servituti subjectus in ejusmodi etc., and they speak publicly in the pulpit free and free, regardless of what the Pope's rights, so hostile to marriage, and the driving of souls do not respect, put into this. 

In the other: If a woman turns away from him through no fault of her husband, especially if one does not know where she is going and has not fled to her friendship, we also have her cited (as said above), so that it will be known to her friendship. After that we also 1) absolve them and set them free according to St. Paul's above 2) sentence. For we consider it unreasonable that one part should sit in uncertainty forever, and the other should be free forever, as often as it wishes, to run away and come back again, which freedom makes many harlots and knaves. But where the same freedom does not permit, they must leave running or mean business. That is our style. If E.F.G. also want to do so, | put it to E.F.G. at home. Hereby commanded by God.

To the illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Mr. Georgen, Thumprobst of Magdeburg, prince of Anhalt, count of Ascanien, lord of Bernburg, my gracious lord. 

G. and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! For the sake of Wilhelm Rinecken 1) | did not know otherwise, because | would have answered E. F. G. in the next letter. | know for certain that | had it in mind when | wrote, as it also fell from my pen. For my head and heart are full of thoughts. So age is now here and, weakened by work, has been forgotten. | therefore ask E. F. G. to have patience with me, an old forgotten man; for, without E. F. G.'s intercession, | myself would like to be at Wilhelm Rincken's beck and call wherever | can, as my special good friend, and also a true Christian, since | consider him to be. Therefore | add to E. F. G.'s knowledge that my gracious lord, even over the table, has graciously accepted my request and ordered in the canteen that S. C. F. G. want to take Wilhelm Rincken's things into the plot 2c. for E. F. G.'s faithful sake 2c. 

That E. F. G. afterwards desires from Duke Georgeil and his prelates trade at Leipzig, as M. Hausmaun is said to have written, | would have written to E. F. G. long ago. So it happens to me that often other good friends’ letters and queries occur, after which there is no one to request it, often the messengers do not wait nor request it, but | cannot be ready for everyone at all hours, as no lesser or greater office can do; so the answers remain with me and decay. Therefore, | am now sending the writings that have been entrusted to me; E. F. G. will know how to send them back to me. | have spoken verbally with E. F. G. how much | would like the bishoprics and large monasteries to remain for church entertainment, so that Germany would not become a Bohemian (Behemian) confusio. For E. F. G. can well see in this writing where Duke George's thoughts lie;

and will certainly become much worse after his death. The wretched man, Cardinal von Hall, could do much good and help here; but the devil rides him that he asks nothing of the poor church and its descendants. Well, God help; if not, then Cardinal von Schénberg's word will become truth, since he said: We do not want to do now, because we can; afterwards Germany will not be brought back as we think. Although | am the Pope's arch-enemy, | would like to see the monasteries and convents come into proper use, first of all for the church, then, what is left, for common secular benefit (as is reasonable); primum quaerite regnum Dei etc. ("Seek first the kingdom of God" 2c.). Behold, have | become a preacher? But for this reason, gracious Prince and Lord, because the Holy Father desires some persons for pastoral care, and we ourselves are in short supply everywhere, such gossip has occurred to me that now almost no one helps to educate persons, except what my most gracious Lord, the Prince, does, which cannot reach far, although the Holy Father uses the monasteries’ goods for this purpose. Therefore, | ask that His Holiness also help me and do what is possible, as | quite comfortingly assure His Holiness. However, | will look around to see where | can find the two people E. F. G. has requested. | hereby command the dear God, who is himself bishop, as he is, of his dear bride and church, so that we may also ask and help, as St. Paul says: Cooperatores sumus, sicut agricola est cooperator Dei in frumento creando, sed instru- mentalis et ,inductus [We are co-workers, just as the farmer is God's co-worker in bringing forth grain, but a tool-like and brought-forward one].

Since the church in the neighboring town of Heimchen had appointed Anton Otto from Herzberg to the office of Diaconus, and desired that this profession be confirmed by a public ordination, we have found, after investigating the learning of Antonius, that he has diligently occupied himself with the study of Christian godliness, and understands the gospel doctrine, and accepts the opinion of the general church of Christ in all articles, which our church also confesses, and that he abhors all fanatical opinions, which are rejected by the judgment of the general church of Christ. He also promised that he would faithfully present to the people the pure doctrine that we profess. Therefore, by public ordination, he is commanded in the church to teach the gospel and administer the sacraments according to his calling. Therefore we commend him to the Church of Heimchen, and ask that the Holy Spirit may guide the ministry of this Anton to the glory of God and of our Lord JEsu Christ and to the salvation of the Church.

God and peace in Christ. Sublime, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! This poor widow of Jacoff Bernhard's blessed, who drowned while hunting, has asked me often and through many (for | do not like to trouble the F. F.

It is therefore my very humble request that E. F. G., as a Christian prince, created in the image of God, show himself to be a judge of widows and father of orphans against these poor women and not let any Ziba hinder him.

To the honorable, noble and wise, mayors and council of the city of Amberg, our favorable lords and friends. 1) 

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ before. Honorable, wise, favorable gentlemen! After your wisdom has applied to us for a Christian preacher, we kindly inform you that we are highly inclined to promote the beginning of Christian, wholesome life in your church, and thank God that He has called you to His praise and right knowledge and to blessedness, so that you will not be driven to strengthen false worship and persecution of the truth. But after so many pious preachers have been chased away in many places, and some of them have been murdered with cruelty, God sends the punishment that there are now few competent persons to be found. Now we can well consider that E. W. would like to have a respectable, stately person: such persons with us are burdened with offices that they cannot well be sent to other places; but we have nevertheless thought of one, by the name of Andreas Hugl of Salzburg, in whom there is no infirmity, except that the person may not be respectable and the voice may not be so large as is well befitting in a large church. Otherwise he is intelligent, very well learned, moral, God-fearing and of an honest nature, who often preaches here in our church and has a good form and way of teaching. We have spoken to him and urged him to accept this office in your church, if he is called by your writings. But we did not want to send him to you with this messenger, because he is not a great person. But where E. W. did not respect the same, but wanted to regard his good skill more, and had written to him or to us that he wanted to dispose of E. W., he offered himself to do so. Thereupon E. W. may indicate her opinion. E. W., as the intelligent and God-fearing, want to consider that this is the highest service of God and that God requires to the highest, to plant right salutary Lahr, to give our

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ beforehand. Noble, honorable and strict Lord! We have read and considered your church order with diligence, as you will see that we have changed a few words in it, and we consider such order, as it is then formed, to be Christian and right, and we also faithfully admonish you and all the rulers of the countryside that you, as God commanded. all authorities to spread, promote and maintain His holy gospel and right worship, will establish and administer such Christian order with earnestness for the glory of God and for the praise of our Lord Christ and for the blessedness of the people. For this is the right and highest service that the authorities should and can do, as is indicated in your order diligently and Christianly. So all men owe this obedience to God, that we hear our Lord Christ, as commanded: Hic est filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi est complacitum, hunc audite ["This is my beloved Son, in whom | am well pleased, him shall you hear"). And God says: whoever will not listen to the same Lord, he will cast him out and punish him eternally, as God, without a doubt, will terribly begin such extermination with the adversaries of the Gospel in the course of time.

For otherwise | had decided to recall you to the service of both our church and our school. Now that Tubingen has forestalled my recall, and | think that there your work is perhaps more necessary to strengthen the studies and the churches than with us (praise be to God!), | am happy and glad to see that you follow the call of the Tubingen church.

G. desires a preacher in his dying days, | will also look around if | can get one, but | do not yet know who is without a wife; however, | will stop if | get one who leaves his wife sitting here and serves E.

Of ecclesiastical matters, especially church property.

To the strict, firm, wise lords, the councillors of war, called the Thirteen, of the city of Strasbourg, my special favorable lords. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Strict, firm, wise, dear lords! | have received your writing and D. Bucer's advertisement, and | have also given him my answer, as he will tell you. Namely, that [there] shall be no lack of the propositions that have gone out on our part, insofar as this matter, previously agreed upon, is to be peaceful on both sides with silence. | have also indicated to him the other part of the church property, that in this time (if much has recently come to light) de facto silence is to be maintained. However, the persons who have church property and do not respect the pastoral care are to be addressed, so that they become re vera persons. Then, if they do not want to leave, they can be petitioned with such writings and rights, indicated by you, first by public writing and finally brought to justice, or other things can be done, so that their will does not have to follow them. All this will be reported to you by D. Bucerus will continue to tell you about all this, and he will indicate my very reasonable courage and heart to promote the churches, and he will also preach that it is also biblical that we, who have the gospel in vain, not only feed on the goods of the dead 1) but also attack ourselves, which St. Paul says Gal. 6, 6. f.: Communicet instructus instructori omnia bona. Deus non irridetur. But D. Bucer will know how to tell you. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befohlen, Amen. Midweek post Elisabeth [20 Nov] 1538. Martinus Luther.

And as | am aware that E. F. G. is well aware of how to deal with the Anabaptists, but would also like to have concerns [from] more people, 3) it is not only my concern, but also my humble request that E. F. G. seriously expel them from the country, because it is nevertheless the devil's seed, and may well have at first something beautiful seemingly next to the evil one for, but because it is the light devil, the end will finally come to Munster. E. F. G. also do not have to complain that they, expelled, may do harm elsewhere, because elsewhere they do not have much more room, and whether they have it, let those see who have the local regiment and churches. For if | fear that the wolf that strangles in my stable may strangle more in other stables, | cannot therefore leave it unchased. Let each man take care of his own stable. Further, E. F. G. will know how much to consider, because | can write, so D. Butzer will also further indicate my opinion to E. F. G., where it is necessary. May the Father of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, through His Holy Spirit, guide and protect us and all of us in abundant gifts. Amen. Wednesday [after] 4) St. Elisabeth [Nov. 20] 1538.

On the occasion of a plague in Magdeburg, Luther reflects on the fear of death and wishes that Amsdorf will not be infected by the plague. 


Handwritten in Cod. Jen. B 24. n, fol. 159 and in Cod. Goth. 4 From the Schmid collection at Helmstadt in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 79; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 274 and in De Wette, vol. V, pp. 133 f. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1461.

2285 


Grace and peace in Christ! |, too, my dear Amsdorf, have certainly wondered very much what might have happened either to you or to yours that you wrote nothing to us. And after | learned that the plague was raging among you, | could not get any people through whom | could have written. Once | received a letter from you in the book against Schénitz (Antischeniciano) "vom Statthalter", but at that time | had no news of the plague. What you write, that people fear the plague so much at that time, | also experienced at the time of our plague those years ago. And | am surprised that the more abundant the preaching of life in Christ is, the greater is the fear of death among the people, be it that before, when they were under the pope, they feared death less in the false hope of life, but now that the true hope of life is held out to them, they realize how weak their nature is to believe in the overcomer of death, whether God tempts us through weakness and leaves us in fear, and thus Satan dares and is able to do more. For when we lived in the faith of the Pope, we were like the drunken, the drowsy, or rather like the frenzied, taking even the right death for life, since we did not know what death and the wrath of God were; now that the truth shines and we see the wrath of God more clearly, nature, awakened from sleep and frenzy, feels that its powers are nothing to bear death. Thus it comes that they fear more than before. Similarly, when we were in the priesthood, we not only did not feel sin, but stood secure in the presumption that it was righteousness. Now that the certainty has been taken away by the knowledge of sin, we are more afraid than we should be. There we went to the right as secure people where we should have been exceedingly fearful; now we go to the left as fearful where we should be secure. Therefore, in this case, | take comfort in the fact that Christ wants His power to be mighty in the weak [2 Cor. 12:9.]. For since we were strong, righteous and wise in the papacy, Christ's power was not only not made mighty, but was also extinguished.

To the honorable, wise and noble, mayors and council of Amburg, our special good friends. 

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ before. Honorable, wise, noble, special good friends! In response to your other writing, we have spoken with Domino Andrea Hugel, that he would dispose of himself to you in Amburg, and further there hear your mind, which he was willing to do according to his former bidding. And although we do not doubt that he has a good understanding of Christian life, and is blameless in life and morals, and is also reasonable and moral in his actions, and consider him godly, faithful and capable of teaching, we, as we do not know the occasion of your church, do not want to set a measure for you, and ask you, if you will see and hear him, whether he will be accepted for the holy preaching ministry in your church or not; He himself also puts this to God's will and your concern, as he does not seek his own in this matter, but offers to serve for God's glory, if it is considered that his service may bring benefit. But we want to remind and admonish you of good, faithful goodwill, as you have begun to promote the holy gospel for the praise of God and for the blessedness of the Christians in your city, that you want to plant and promote this true, high service of God, namely right worship, which God demands above all things, with earnestness, and, as St. Paul says, you want to be aware of the holy gospel. Paul says, not to be ashamed of the holy gospel, but to consider how highly all men, and especially the rulers and potentates, are commanded to maintain such a ministry, and also how horribly those despise and blaspheme the blood and death of Christ, who condemn his pure doctrine, and help to persecute Christians and shed innocent blood; how great grace also our Lord Christ offers for confession, and what punishment he inflicts on the despisers, saying: "Whosoever shall confess me before the world, him will | confess again before my Father which is in heaven: and whosoever shall deny me, him will | put to shame." This we have told you out of faithful benevolence

To the venerable Father in Christ, D. Martin Luther, the Apostle of Christ, his most revered Lord and Benefactor. 

Hail! Your letter, which is full of spirit and comfort, has pleased me greatly, my father, who is greatly honored in Christ, and | thank you infinitely for it, and it is quite true what you write, that none of our people dies in unbelief or despair, but all, young and old, fall asleep in the Lord. But ten years ago, even under the gospel, they feared less than they do now; indeed, they feared nothing: one neighbor visiting another, helping and serving him. Now nothing happens, but they avoid each other in such a way that not only the neighbors, but also the closest and best friends keep away from their own. But, praise be to God! The plague has become less severe and is decreasing daily; God would have us be safe from war as well, for everything seems to threaten us with the same. You have already heard about the new marriage of Duke George's son; God grant his prosperity to this event; here, at least, one prophesies and proclaims extremely bad things about this marriage. If there isa true spirit in the mouth of those prophets, then woe to that country and to the lords of the land! We pray for you daily and diligently. How miserable the appearance of the church would be if the Lord took you away and left us behind. Far be it, far be it, far be it, my dear Father! Fare well in Christ with your whole house.

This letter reached Wittenberg on Nov. 6 (see St. Louis edition, Vol. XXII, 1300, Tischreden, Cap. 48, §4.) - It is striking that Luther says here in our letter that he learned of the death from the prince, while Lauterbach reports in the same place that Luther's wife, Melanchthon, Jonas and Lauterbach had allmalig brought him the news. - Melanchthon's letter to Hieronymus Weller, Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 607, No. 1751, is to be dated November 8 (instead of November 18 with Peucer, as already Késtlin 1. e. p. 680 aa p. 529 has noted).

To the distinguished man, Mr. Sebastian Heller, Doctor of Laws and Chancellor of Margrave George. 

Although | knew that after your kindness you had long since accepted this citizen of yours of your own free will, | nevertheless gladly gave him a letter to you, since he asked for it. For both the memory of your virtue and of our friendship is very pleasant to me, and | am not unwillingly at the will of this Stibarus. For | have perceived that he is a modest man.

He has promised both. Therefore, as you have done until now, you will take him under your protection. For you see that our state needs your protection. 

You have quite a few students (scholasticos) here, for whom there is very good hope, and we truly have no others now who are preferable to yours. If our studies are not disturbed by warlike disturbances, | hope that the youth will be happily encouraged in every kind of teaching, and that the churches will finally have well-instructed leaders. This matter will one day serve for harmony, and | pray with all my heart that our Lord Jesus Christ may restore it.

Magnus, Duke of Mecklenburg, to Luther. (Regest.) 


On the implementation of the Reformation in Mecklenburg. Duke Magnus, since 1532 the episcopal administrator of Schwerin, has appointed godly preachers everywhere in his father's lands and introduced right doctrine and wholesome ceremonies, but in the monasteries, convents and cities, which Duke Albrecht governs jointly with his father, there is still much godlessness with corner masses, relic service and pilgrimages. Against this, Magnus lodged a protest at the Diet held in Parchim on November 10, 1538, which he sent to Luther and had his deputy, Henning Marburg, ask whether he could leave it at that and have a free, safe conscience. - Luther replied on May 14, 1539.

We do not want to let you, to whom we are especially inclined, know this at the New Year's Fair (jarsmeer), as we have heard, and we want the afflicted Christian Church, as well as our little person in your pater noster, to have it in remembrance.

Grace and peace in Christ! | have had nothing to write, my dear Amsdorf, except that | did not want the messenger to leave without a letter to you.

But according to the testimony of Rebenstock, tom. Il, lol. 241 b (wrong 141 b), and the Hall manuscript, Bindseil, Colloquia, tom.

Luther under the name of Nicolaus Hausmann, appointed pastor of Freiberg in 1538. year." No date. German in Bindseil; Latin in Rebenstock. We consider the Latin to be the original. (Against Bindseil and Seidemann.) Seidemann, "Lutherbriefe," p. 49, lets Hausmann's letter be written "in August 1538," and places Hausmann's death on September 1.

If you are favorable to the man Wilhelm Rinke in the matter against Count Albrecht, | have nevertheless also wanted to add my spur, so that you have an opportunity to object and to excuse your inclination or your impetuousness in this so just cause. For it is said that Wilhelm's adversary plagues heaven and hell with all his might, so that the judges are seduced by evil persuasions before they judge; and we know the nature of this man, that therefore much, if not everything, is at stake in your and Herr Brick's astuteness, then also in the observation of the adversary.

Your in Christ highly venerable husband, M. Gabriel Zwilling, the faithful bishop of the church at Torgau, his extremely dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Johann Melde has asked me, my dear Gabriel, that | would use myself for him, whether he could perhaps become his successor as pastor in Neiden (Neyden) through your help. He has been held up for a long time in the life of the countryside and among the drudgery of the peasants, and for the parish priests the stay in the countryside is burdensome with the so great wickedness of the ballers. It is said that he had some tendency to drink. But that this could have taken place with him daily, his poverty did not permit, as you know, and | hope that he will improve. Therefore, if it is in your power and can be done, let him be commanded to you, if perhaps he could have a quiet life, to spend his time reading and praying.

And if his language was not useless among our people 2) we would not have let him go.

People from all over the world are oppressed. Therefore, it seemed good to us to commend him to you, whether he might be of use among your countrymen through the ministry of the tongue or serve very many neighbors. Fare well in the Lord and greet all of our people. 

You not only know more news than we do, but you also have it. For it is said that the emperor and the Burgundians are undertaking a war against Geldern (? Gelras), and that he has already sent twenty thousand Spaniards there by sea. In our country there is now a serious conflict between the Landgrave of Hesse and the Duke of Brunswick, 3) for which a meeting is already being held in Frankfurt, between hope and fear, only that the consideration of the church in our country hopes for peace. "The clergy are really doing too much, the sack will have to tear in the end. Greetings to you, my Lord Katha, and to your pathchen, my daughter Margaretha, who has learned to sing beautifully the words of Matth. 11: "Come to me, all of you" and other things more. You have chosen these as your pathchen, and | also command them to you.

But listen, my master Kathe has ordered me to joke with you. We are in doubt here whether your sea has dried up. For after the permission to eat meat dishes came through the gospel, there have never been fewer of your fish here, namely, salted fish, such as herring, haddock, 4) plaice, and salmon, so that we are now in doubt as to whether your sea is dry. 


3) The landgrave had intercepted the duke's secretary with letters to the Elector of Mainz. See Seckendorf, Hist. Luth., lib. lll, p. 294, § 69 (De Wette). 

4) This is our assumption, since truscopiscium is not found in our lexicons. Perhaps it is a word formed by Luther "dry fish" (stick fish), like the schollensium that follows.

no longer by the freedom of the gospel, but by the necessity of hunger, to be forced to eat meat dishes, with such a great lack of salt fish, unless perhaps all salt fish together with the fish fear the wrath of the pope, the God on earth, and finally even the seas flee his lightning, after he is despised on the land.

G. and F. in Christo. Respectable, highly respected, dear doctor and brother-in-law! | have taken your advice that my dear brother-in-law N. should play the short one, and (so that further unpleasantness may occur) let the verdict be pronounced in Stolpen. For we too (if the full report had come to us, as the closest friendship agrees) would have spoken without doubt in favor of this marriage and not against it, and where it would be necessary, would still do so. It is true that (where it comes before us theologians), the decree XXVII, Quaest. 2: Sufficiat, and the like respect nothing. For we have thrown the Pabst's right under the imperial rights, as they are much better neither the Pabst's fool's decree, which is always: Lamb, come here! 

Also if we could defend the Canon of Pope against you jurists, as you interpret the word solus (alone) quasi exclusivam patriae potestutis (as if it excluded the paternal power), which does not suffer the circumstantiae (circumstances), but includirt patriam potestatem (the paternal power), excluding only coitum seu copulam (the cohabitation or the carnal union). 

But it is not necessary to defend the pope, and if that is not what we want to do. So in this case the Canon Sufficiat is right and not against us. For he speaks de consensu legitimo [of lawful consent], as Gratianus afterwards, (though unreasonably) rejected by the glossator; not to speak of it now. 








Because now in this case the virgin as an orphan has the closest friendship for herself, with us auctoritas parentum [the paternal authority] is got enough, and is not called solus: solius puellae consensus, sed solus, sc. consentiente patria potestate, sine copula tamen [alone: alone of the girl's consent, but alone, namely, with the consent of the paternal authority, but without carnal connection]. 

You lawyers interpret solus pro solius puellae [only as: only of the girl], but we theologians, where we want to defend the pope against you, interpret it solus, pro sola pactione et desponsatione etiam ante copulam [only, as only by the contract and the engagement, also without carnal connection], as the texts themselves give it. And thus Pope Nicolaus can use lawyers for us against you, unless we do not need it, but ordered civilibus juribus [the secular laws] to judge such. Hereby commanded by God, Amen.

Luther, as the visitator of the Thuringian district, asks them to settle the disputes that probably relate to antinomianism. Something from Agricola.

To the most esteemed gentlemen, Friedrich Myconius and Justus Menius, the visitators of Thuringia, his extremely dear brothers and friends. 

Best brothers in Christ! You see what Satan is up to in Saalfeld. Since the prince is now absent, this is the only remedy, that you two or one of you, since you are called to it by the office which is commanded to you, come and extinguish this spark before it starts a conflagration.

| know that Aquila was such a zealot for the Ten Commandments ay that he was called Moses. And, as you know, the capelians or preachers, even the sextons (aeditui) sometimes presume to be masters of the bishops, as Anus was of Athanasius and Alexander. But nothing can be judged about the unknown matter. Some think that Aquila also became a follower of Agricola (Agricolanus), which | do not hope, nor do | believe to be true yet. Therefore, it will be up to you to be vigilant in this matter. Here, M. Eisleben still walks along, naving become nothing other than what he has been, just as he has walked along up to now.

I understand from your writing that Satan also wants to come among the children of God, as happens in more places, where it 1s evident that God is threatening the devil with our great ingratitude, which we so miserably despise His blessed Word. But because the districts of this principality are divided, it is my advice that you ask and request Friedrich Mecum in Gotha; if you also want to ask Just Mentus in Eisenach, it 1s all the better, since they have been ordered to visit the Thuringian lands.

No. 2513. (Wittenberg.) February 25, 1538S. To Andreas Hugel, pastor in Amberg. 


Luther gives him guidance on how to answer an opponent who claims the merit of good works. 


The original is at Gotha in Cod. chart. 1048. Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 267. Printed in Schutze, vol. Ill, p. 95 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 167. 


Grace and peace in Christ! What you write, my dear Andrew, about the Eckscheu disputator, that he wants works to merit eternal life after justification, is too extensive a matter to be settled in one letter. But I answer in short words thus: First, that you urge the disputant to the restitution of all things which they possess by this their doctrine, that works shall merit grace before justification. When this restitution has been made, you will answer about the works that are done after justification. For you must be a little bolder and more argumentative against these unrighteous and unlearned sophists, since you know that they are asses in this doctrine. Then to the matter (which these "asses' do not need to indicate): those who are justified in Christ are heirs of the kingdom through faith (as Paul teaches in the letter to the Galatians). Therefore it must be admitted that they do not earn the kingdom of heaven by works alone, but also 1) by omission of works, yes, even by sleep. For what should the children of GOD not earn? What should an heir, the son, not earn with the father, since he is heir without merit from birth alone? The Father entices the Son, who is an heir by nature, to become an heir through obedience.

Friedrich Myconius to Luther. 


He tells a" dream of Melanchthon, and adds a partial interpretation. Full of Bucer's orthodox sermon and your devout, diligent listening to the word of God on the part of the Frankfurters. 


From a copy in Cod. Goth. 190, p. 198, printed in Corp. fol., Vol. Ill, 640. - This is only a part of the letter, which in the codex has the heading: Sornnium Philippi a Myconio scripturn; through this, Luther's letter to Melanchthon of March 14 becomes understandable. The entire letter is taken from a letter codex in Wernigerode and reported by C. Krafft in the Zeitschrift fur Kirchengeschichte, Ill, 327. It also contains information about the convention in Frankfurt. 


Yesterday Philip dreamt that he saw a magnificent painting, in which the image of Christ hanging on the cross was painted first, around which, as it were, little souls (animulae), dressed in white clothes, were painted. The princes of the kingdom joined them, dressed in their ornaments, going there in a beautiful order, as it is customary to do. After them came a certain donkey, dressed ina linen coverlet, 1) as it is called, 


1) This is conjecture. In the text: super pellica, which cannot be proven lexically.

| interpret that donkey as the German one, which both have ridden and miserably plagued at their will so far. But whether this dream means anything, we will see. 

After that [Philip] gave praise to Johann Sturm of Strasbourg, whom he praised highly because of his modesty, sincerity, godliness and scholarship. 

Bucer preached a very learned sermon here yesterday 3) before an extremely numerous congregation in St. Bartholomew's Church about the Cananaean woman, which was indeed full of spiritual sentiment, not without great favor and careful attention from the entire congregation. At the end he also presented his and the congregation's opinion about the true presentation of the body of Christ, that this body is also received with the mouth in the Holy Communion under the bread and wine. Then | saw with how great earnestness, with how great devotion and respectability a part of the people received the Holy Communion. And although, as far as the ceremonies are concerned, they differ somewhat from ours and from the usual way, nothing is done lightly here, nothing without decency and Christian seriousness, and if we want something to be conformed to our customs here, we hope to be able to obtain it without difficulty. | do not know if | have seen or heard any congregation which so diligently hears the word of Christ, and with so great unanimity, as it were with one voice, sings his songs and hymns. But this virgin and bride, who is to be adorned for Christ, has now been praised enough, so that if she should become an adulteress, which is far off, | cannot reprove and rebuke her again without shame. 

Our princes bravely and steadfastly carry out the work of Christian heroes, and we miss nothing in them, except that | wish they were kinder to their bodies. For they afflict them greatly, douse and bury them almost in the best Rhine wine, and say that they seek and strengthen friendships by these practices. 


2) In the text: quasi in ad hunc beatorum ritum perduceret. Instead of in we have assumed enim, which in a case like this remains untranslated. 

3) From this follows the timing of this letter. "Yesterday" was the Sunday ReminiScere, March 2, because Bucer preached on the Gospel of the Cananaean Woman.

How the peace conditions can be determined, since you demand an open door for the gospel, but they want it closed. Even though they may be outwardly compelled to open the streets to you, they do not do so from the heart. The matter has come to a crisis, that Christ and Belial should be reconciled, or that one should give way to the other, which is both impossible, unless it is done by force, which we try to avert by pleading, but it would be in vain, since their minds are leprous and thus only rage more. Your dream has pleased me extraordinarily; whether perhaps Christ wants to act in his miraculous way and put the Egyptians to shame either by terror or by the power of Israel, just as he also frightened the Cananites, since Jacob in Sichern feared their power and was already close to destruction. And this would be it, that the emperor and the pope are pulled away by the rope of the donkey against your will. But we fight with prayer, and by the same we shall prevail, not knowing in the meantime the hidden way of God in many waters, and His footsteps that are not known. 

Here, praise God, all is well and quiet, even in your house. But may you paint your dream clearly for us. For we, too, have painted the thing itself, but we do not understand the situation, the clothing, the image of the persons, except for the one of the princes, the princes, and your crucified one.

Hail! After ours handed over the articles on the form of peace, the consultation of the imperial envoy and the peacemakers was delayed until March 12. One of them, that of the envoy, was written in an opprobrious manner, the other in a lighter manner, indicating that the peacemakers would work for a standstill of several years, so that in the meantime meetings could be held to discuss the harmony of the churches and the doctrine. For now the emperor no longer mentions the council, nor does he hope that one will take place, and for this reason, if the envoy is telling the truth, he is angry with the ranting pope. Our people will send an answer. Perhaps they will say exactly what conditions they can accept. For haste is necessary, lest ours be oppressed unprepared, if there is no standstill, though we still hope for tranquility. 

At the beginning there were frightening speeches about the Turks; now it is suddenly quiet with them, and they say that an armistice has been made by the French. In the Dutch there are great armaments; they threaten the King of England not indistinctly, but many suspect other things. Yes, | cannot write anything certain about the commonwealth.

Yes, our peasants intend to kill us by starvation without need; very many students are forced to leave because of the wickedness of those who hide the grain.

Grace and peace in the Lord! My dear Kymaeus, 

U. Valentin Schreiber tells us that he was called by you to a parish. And you are certainly doing a great and good work by helping such a poor man, who is also godly and learned, as you know. And he is ready and willing, even eager to come, but he has oppressive circumstances and extreme poverty at home. He has no travel money, so you would do very well if you could get the costs of the trip for him, but | don't see how he could make the trip.

Therefore, send the costs, or, if you are not able to do it so suddenly, may you say well whether we can perhaps borrow so much somewhere. For | too very much wish that the man be advised and helped.

Hail! | am heartily grateful that you have written to me so often and so lovingly. Whatever the outcome of these negotiations that are being conducted here, | hope that the community will be calm; Christ grant that. Our people are ready to defend themselves with steadfast and brave courage, if necessary, even though another peace formula is still being discussed. For the former one, which had been proposed, has been rejected. A standstill (induciae) of 18 months was granted only to those who have now accepted the doctrine. And a cruel and ungodly condition is added that we should not add anyone to us nor defend ourselves. Therefore this formula

That is why this intriguer is now playing his game. He has tried to frighten the cities with wonderful tricks and to disunite our people. But by the inconsistency of the conditions he has managed to make both himself more hated and all our people united without any discord. We have borne the slowness and procrastination of the consultations all the more patiently up to now because the Macedonian took care of his healing and the physicians assure us that the disease could have been expelled here if he had devoted himself to this matter with greater care, which the Convention can hardly suffer. Now he is hurrying home for another cure, to be anointed; for he has lichen, that is, Celtic scabies, although he admittedly concealed this. However, it is believed that this type of disease is not very malignant. There is good hope that he will soon regain his former health. He says that he does not feel any weakness in his limbs. He is excited, as he is wont to be, and shows almost his usual activity in business. Nevertheless, you will command him to GOtte in your prayers. Greetings to you D. Briick, Jakob Sturm and many others. Very kindly, many honorable men of all ranks asked for you here, and among them the aldermen of Basel and others.

That the letter belongs to this year is also shown by the two letters of June 3, 1539 in the same matter. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime, 2) highborn prince, gracious lord! E. F. G. graciously wished to grant me this letter, because | could not refuse it after so many requests; E. F. G. will nevertheless know what is right. The Hildener zur Syde has received a short farewell from E. F. G., that must have its cause; but because there, weeping and wailing wife and child, do not know where they are going so suddenly, they ask in complete submission that E. F. G. should give them room and time to go elsewhere, also so that he would not have to leave so suddenly, as if he had been at fault, yes, let his things also do word or report, as he thinks he could do. But | do not know what to ask, E. F. G. will have cause enough. Again, | think and almost worry that the right cabbages are with us in part. Duke Wilhelm's time is approaching again, when the nobility wants to teach the princes that one cannot rule the world without them. Therefore, we must pray all the more vehemently for you princes, and especially for E. F. G. and his relatives. The devil is sorry for the Confession and Apologia, and we must also repay him with ours. God help us continue as before; E. F. G. will know how to graciously respond to this request of mine. 1539, Easter Eve [Apr. 5].

baked bread, so that the council only says that more bread goes out into the country than is eaten here in the city. Some still think that such a famine comes not so much from lack as from stinginess and malice on the part of the wealthy nobility, and there is a lot of strange talk about it, in which | can say nothing. It is true that mau says that N. N. has let himself be heard saying that he will not sell a grain until a bushel is worth 1 old shock or 1 guilder, and that the grain should be taken out of the country and seduced. However, the Elbe also does so much that one cannot grind or bake, because the castle mill has to stand still because of the water. It is a small challenge, but it will become a big one if E. C. F. G. does not provide help and advice. Therefore, we all ask that the C.F.G. will graciously show itself, not only with present help for the need, but also with government, so that those of the nobility do not henceforth buy the grain for themselves alone, and lead it away, and usurp it so brazenly, to the ruin of the C.F.G. country and people They are rich enough without that, that it is nol necessary to take the lives of poor people through hunger, for the sake of their avarice. E. C. F. G. will probably know how to advise further and princely on this. Hereby commanded to the dear Lord Christ, Amen. Wednesday in Easter [April 9] Anno 1539. Martin Luther, D.

Luther recommends a teacher for his son and another Swedish scholar. He encourages him to care for the sciences.

To the most illustrious and highly illustrious Lord, Lord Gustav, the Swedish and Gothic Kings, his most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most noble Lord and most gracious King! Magister Nicolaus of Sweden, your Majesty's faithful and diligent envoy, has reported to me that he has orders to scout out a good teacher for the instruction of your Majesty's royal son. This | have heard with great pleasure, seeing that your Majesty's zeal for godliness and the sciences is bestowed by GOD, namely to others to be a glorious example. For what is a greater adornment for kings, even more necessary for them, than that they either be more gifted by nature than the others, or that they be instructed by the cultivation of the sciences, so that they do not always have to see with foreign eyes and believe the judgment of others. May Christ, who began the work in your royal majesty, complete it through great growth, so that schools may also be established and equipped throughout the kingdom, especially in the cathedral churches, to train young people for service in parishes. For this is the greatest and highest duty of kings, who are above the worldly administration of Christian godliness; this glory your majesty has in high degree above others, most glorious king, and we ask the Lord to rule the heart of your majesty with his spirit. To these and other things, thank God, your Ma

Your Majesty has found among the foreigners some very skilful tools, precisely this already appointed teacher of the royal son, Georg Normann, who, finally found by M. Nicolaus and also requested by me, comes to serve your Majesty. He is a man of holy life, modest, noisy and learned, a skilful and thoroughly worthy teacher of the royal son, whom | particularly commend to your Majesty. Yes, he also brings with him a traveling companion, Michael Agricola, a son and country child of your Sweden, who is admittedly still a young man, but distinguished by learning, great gifts and good manners, who can create a great deal of benefit in your Majesty's realm; | also commend him to your Majesty as a proven man, and pray to Christ that Christ himself may create much fruit through them, who calls and ordains them through your Majesty.

To the man to be highly honored in Christ, Mr. Ambrosius Moiban, Doctor of Theology, the faithful servant of the Church in Breslau, his exceedingly dear brother in the Lord. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! Mr. Winkler will inform you, best Ambrosius, of my opinion in this Jewish matter. For since the Jews, as Isaiah says, are exceedingly hostile to their King and God, and are the noblest and sharpest teeth of the serpent himself, they are not to be trusted in anything, but all theirs are to be considered suspect. Therefore you will tell the baptized Jews to give the letter of divorce (/ibellum repudii), not in the form prescribed by the Jews (lest they should invent rights against us), but in a form approved by the Christian authorities. "If the unbeliever divorce, let him divorce" [1 Cor. 7:15.]; they as baptized have become believers, and may tell the unbelievers that they may divorce because they will. If they are not satisfied with this form, let them be despised and 1) hear no more, and these may marry or free themselves in the Lord, if they can. Only see that they do not become fictitious Christians. Fare well in the Lord. On Saturday after Misericordias Domini [April 26] 1539. Yours, Martin Luther.

To the honorable and wise, mayors and councilmen of the old city of Bernburg, my 


favorable good friends. 


Honorable, wise, dear gentlemen and friends! | am sorry that Doctor Cyriacus is so miserable. But it is not so terrible for his person, because God's judgment must always begin (as St. Peter says) at God's house, for the punishment and horror of the evil world, which is now ripening beyond measure for punishment with avarice and all kinds of courage, so that they may see what they deserve and must soon suffer, because God is punishing His own so harshly as a sign. We read that an old man asked to control his pride in spiritual gifts, so that he would be possessed for several weeks 2c. But we should also do our part, as you offer yourselves, and consider it good, if you would demand Master Andre, then | want him to be 


able (I hope), that he would do his best.

To the highly famous and worthy Prince and Lord, Lord Magnus, Duke of Mecklenburg, [Prince] of Wenden 2c., Administrator of the Schwerin Parish, his most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | have read the letter in which E. F. G. inquires whether she has done enough for the conscience that she demanded the restoration of the church in the public meeting and protests that it is not E. F. G.'s fault, since it has been stated by others that this restoration is not proceeding properly. In fact, | consider this to be the case: since the sovereigns in the Schwerin parish are divided, and E. F. G. does not have the power to restore the church. F. G. does not have the power to force the other part, but only to exhort it, especially in a matter that has not yet taken root: so my opinion is that E. F. G. has done enough, especially since E. F. G. testifies that in the part where she can diligently exercise supervision, the churches are supplied with the word of God. Therefore, it only remains that E. F. G. presses for the authority and the promise. When this is given, the spirit of the council will give further advice. In Him, E.F.G. is quite at ease. In a hurry and under a lot of business.

Concerns of the Wittenberg theologians about 


the Reformation of the University of Leipzig. (Regest.) 


This concern was made for Duke Henry the Pious and was probably written by Melanchthon, but has no signatures. Whether it was written between May 23 and 29, during which time Luther, Jonas and Melanchthon were in Leipzig, or before, cannot be determined. 


From the Acts in the Weimar Archives, Reg. Ju, fol. 141, printed in Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 712.

No. 2536. To Spalatin. 


Luther asks him to reassure the people of Werdau and to persuade them that they are satisfied with their pastor. 


(Wittenberg.) May 20, 1539. 


A simultaneous poor copy is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. C. 9. 27. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 320. Burkhardt remarks on the matter: "The interrogation of the tradesmen and citizens, which took place on December 30, 1538, had the result that Riemann was completely incomprehensible and did not keep order of thought in the sermon. (Cf. the Electoral Rescript of June 3, 1539.) Incidentally, the Elector promised the congregation that he would provide for another pastor, but they would have to be patient. (June 26, 1539.) Luther's position on the matter can be seen in his letter to Riemann of Aug. 2, 1539. Spalatin admitted that Riemann was hard in the pulpit because the people were hard and rough, as they had already removed two pastors (namely Andres Hautzhaufen, currently at Céthen, and Wolfgang Agricola, currently at Briesnitz). However, Riemann remained in Werdau, although a decree of the Elector from Oct. 9, 1539, is available that Riemann should be transferred to Ronneburg. 


Grace and peace! | see, my dear Spalatin, that you 1) are rich in goodness, not to say in kindness and forbearance. For apart from Zwickau, 2) there is no town in the territory of our prince against which | am more unwilling (if it may be) than Werdau (Werde); so much do | dislike their Voigtland heads, which think that this task has been given to them, that they always worry their pastors.

If they now do not want to desist, you may tell them, also in my name, if you want, that | will work against them with all my strength with the prince, so that their heads are broken. If you were not in the means, | would have written a letter to them worthy of them; therefore, | ask you again to protect the priest in Werdau and to curb his rebellious parishioners. If Orlamiinde were free, | would gladly urge the prince to transfer the Werdau priest there, but in such a way that they should not have another priest for ever. 2) At the same time, you should tell them that you will protect the priest in Werdau and keep his rebellious parishioners in check. At the same time, you are to tell them that they should not finally irritate the prince himself, and that they should remember that they are Werdauers who know the entire duchy, that they are not princes of Saxony nor margraves of Meissen, so that what they do not fear or expect does not come upon them. | have not written to the priest, since | am sure that you will report this to him.

To the most illustrious Prince and Lord, Lord George, Prince of Anhalt, Provost of the Church at Magdeburg, Count of Ascanien, Lord of Bernburg, his most gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene Prince! 

M. Georg Aemilius, a very good young man who is excellently gifted with a poetic vein, has asked me to recommend him, who is unknown to E. F. G.. For he is seized by an extraordinary affection for your name and deeds, since he has heard, also through our award, that you are a prince who gives such a rare example, not only in our time, but also in all past times, since you, in addition to other virtues and gifts, which are bestowed upon you by God, and which put other princes in the shade, you not only cultivate and favor the sciences and all studies of the liberal arts (humanitatis) and of scholarship, but also practice them in fact and in your own person in the most excellent manner. Therefore, may the E. F. G. allow the virtues and gifts of God to be praised and extolled from her, whether by the example of E. F. G. other princes, but especially the ecclesiastical ones, may be stimulated, namely those who are good, or put to shame, those who are evil. For it is unseemly that so much light and adornment should be hidden under a bushel, and who should not wish that such people, even if only a few, should be found in the ecclesiastical regiment today? Yes, who should not have the confidence that, if we had even three noble regents in the church, similar to E. F. G., this very church would be reformed in a short time in the most prosperous way by good manners, to say nothing of the highest and first gift, namely, the pure teaching of the gospel, which would completely reign under your influence? For, as | have often testified to E. F. G., | do not desire the downfall of the bishoprics, but their reformation, and we pray daily that the Lord will condescend to finally use such an instrument as E. F. G. is, and to awaken to due government with such gifts. Therefore it pleased me that Aemilius wanted to glorify your name. Who knows.

What opportunity does the Lord seek? For we are certain that E. F. G. will be more humbled than puffed up by these exaltations of praise, since she alone has the glory of God in mind most ardently and everywhere, and yet (even during E. F. G.'s lifetime) her light must not be hidden under a bushel. E. F. G. was quite at ease in Christ. On Tuesday after Exaudi [May 20] 1539.

Most Serene, Highborn Prince and Lord! To Your Lordly Grace we are always ready with diligence and obedient service. Most gracious lord! Caspar Falck zu Bledyn, our especially good friend and brother-in-law, has now requested and indicated to us how he recently, as your churfl. Your Grace was here in Wittenberg, he sent a supplement to the same Your Lordship, in which he reports that his dear father, blessed, forty years ago left two hectares of land there in Bledyn to Your Lordship. for an annual interest, to build and to use; Among the same two farmsteads he has at present let fall one, the other one, however, his father blessed and he until now quietly and from manly unhindered driven, enjoyed and used, and from it paid the annual interest to the office Schweinitz, as to be found without doubt in all annual registers, unabated, the confidence, because such farmsteads are held in dignity, and completely no retardate of the interest is in arrears, such farmsteads would be left to him for further use. However, the Schweinitz castle is said to have given him notice of the same, whom he requested and amicably questioned as to the reasons for this: he is said to have received this answer, that E. churf. G. Rentmeister had this concern, that by the lapse of time it might be argued that such a hoof belonged to his property, and was not a chattel, as is then further shown in the mentioned supplement. And even though he was graciously promised that he would be provided with a gracious answer to his supplications, this still remained, perhaps because of many coincidental and especially the Leipzig business.1) For this reason, he has asked us quite diligently that we want him to humbly plead with E. churf. G. that the same E. churf. G. want him to remain graciously for the annual interest, from which he wants to pay the interest, as has happened so far, annually into the office undiminished and willingly. And if perhaps the same wants to be increased, that he will be

But if he does not use them, he will willingly give them to other farmers who use the other three plots. For if such hooves were stolen and taken from him, he would find it very difficult to maintain them, since he would otherwise have a small and narrow estate. Thus, some of his brothers would be out of the country, who would ever want a subsidy, and also Jérg Falck, one of his brothers at Segeren, would keep a good part of the meadow wax for himself for his need. In addition, he would still be a young landlord, married this year, and still provided with a small stock. Considering all this and other things, we could not refuse his request to us. In humility and submission, E. chf. G. want to resolve such distress in mercy, and to let the said falcon follow and remain the farm for the annual interest, and, to do so, graciously order the Schweinitz castle, so that the young landlord will pay off,2) and E. ch.

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ beforehand. Sublime, highborn, most gracious Prince and Lord! We humbly inform E. C. F. G. that Joh. Cellarius, preacher at Frankfurt, is now and here; after we have talked to him about whether he would like to be used in Meissen, he has offered to do so, provided he would like to obtain permission from the Council of Frankfurt: as we do not doubt, the Council of Frankfurt will gladly serve E. C. F. G. especially in this case, which is also convenient for them. We also do not want to deprive E. C. F. G. of the fact that he is now taking his wife and servants with him from Bautzen, who are still waiting for him in Leipzig. Now he cannot lie with his servants for long; therefore, if he should be needed, his opportunity demands that a certain place be indicated to him, where he would also have provisions; for waiting with wife and child would be difficult for him. For this reason, we respectfully request that E. C. F. G. graciously inform us, if Joh. Cellarius should remain, where he should dispose of himself and who would provide him with entertainment; and in the event that he should remain, it is necessary to write immediately to the Council of Frankfurt. God keep E. C. F. G. always. Date Wittenberg, Sunday Trinitatis [June 1] 1539. M. L. 

4) And E. C. F. G. may also graciously consider in such cases that the Duke Georgians (if still raw) may send E. C. F. G. a register to pay what they have meanwhile consumed because they did not want to know about any appeal. So E. C. F. G. would have to pay the banquet high enough; unless E. C. F. G. knows other ways beforehand. My concern is that E. C. F. G. is not burdened with expenses.

The Elector commissions Luthern to settle the disputes in Werdau. Compare the situation with No. 2536. 


Transcript in Weimar Archives, Reg. .li, fol. 138b. C. 9. 27. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 323. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and esteemed, dear devotee and faithful! What our also dear faithful, the council of Werdau, now write to us again on account of their pastor, and with the sending of interrogated reports thereon humbly request (untherdeniglich biethen), such you will find enclosed for your perusal. Now we are very reluctant to learn of such a dispute that is taking place there in Werdau between the same priest and most of his parishioners. 

We are also concerned that more trouble than good would result from this. If, however, we would ever prefer to have such trouble stopped, and would like to see and know unity between the pastor and the parishioners, we graciously request that you read such a deal and diligently consider what we want to do about it after the occasion arises, and if perhaps, according to your concerns, a change should be made with the pastor, and another one should be appointed to his position.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther, Jonas, Cruciger and Melanchthon. 


The Elector asks them to raise a concern about the book of he Bishop of Meissen. 


The original concept with Briick's corrections is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, p. 102. 38 A. 4 Printed by Burkhardt, p. 324. 

To our G(russ) to(uvor). Venerable and reverend, dear devotees and faithful! The highborn prince, Lord Heinrich, Duke of Saxony 2c., reported to us next to Wirzen, when we were both there together, how the Bishop of Meissen had shortly before sent some of his chapter there to S. L., who had advertised to S. L., and had also sent an instruction on religion, with the request that S. L. would have them and the monastery in gracious protection, and leave them with their old liberties and rights, as would be customary. To this, S. L. gave an answer to the sent ones, that because the delivered letter would be a bit long, that his beloved would not want to see or move it in a hurry, so S. L. wants to do it after her opportunity and answer her then. For this reason, his beloved has now sent us a copy of the aforementioned request, together with the document sent to him, and has asked us to order you to see and move it, and to hear your objections to it, for which you can send the same to us. 


1) This "you" we have added, and the words "as Christians due", which stand after "abbitten", we have put here.

We also want to know what the bishop is to be informed about and to answer. Therefore, our gracious request to you is that you take the above- mentioned document in hand and diligently examine and move it with one another, and also that you first inform us, as far as possible, of your good judgment and opinion by returning the document, and especially what you consider should be given to the bishop by our cousin (vnsern vedtern) as an answer, so that the bishop and the chapter will not be misled by their fraudulent pretenses. We would like to see this happen in the most beneficial way, so that the people will not be seduced by such gleamers, who, in our opinion, seek and mean something different than they pretend. So we also think that if the day in Nuremberg on the first of August would have its progress, as if it were not yet completely and certain, then the other part's actions would also run in that direction, so our cousin has also kindly asked us in particular to give S. L. the answer first. We did not want to save this for you; do us, as those 1) we are graciously inclined to, a special gracious favor. Date Sunday the 8th [after] Viti [June 22] Anno 1539.

Au Wenceslaus Link to Nuremberg. 


Joke about gifts made and to be made. A short remark about Duke George and the Archbishop of Mainz. 


From the Kraftscken Collection at Husum in Schitze, Vol. III, p. 103 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 189. 

To the in the Lord highly venerable brother, Wenceslaus Link, Doctor of Theology, Bishop and Pastor of the Church at Nuremberg, his superior. 

Grace and peace! Although | knew beforehand that there was an enormous amount of gold florins with you, and even wished myself luck that the small gift | had sent to your wife through Mr. Stromer was so small, there was nothing else by which | could hope that your anger and your threats (as you have so beautifully invented them) would be appeased.

For such oratorical achievements are with us daily in not a little greater quantity and usefulness than with you those gold pieces, and yet we consider them a game and joke. But since you threaten anew that we shall again desire what you may send uus, either to me or to Kathe, | wonder how this Crulchian or Colditzian murmur (Crulchius seu Colditius fremitus) at Nuremberg has become so strong, fat and thick, since | Know that you Nurembergers are not in the habit of devouring fat morsels, unless perhaps a Kopfperlinger has become a Werverlinger 2).

There is no news here that you do not know. | would have sworn that Duke George was other than such a wicked and lost man, even though he has not yet reached the wickedness of the Mainz monster. But God will accomplish what He has begun, only we must continue to pray. Surely the end is coming, surely 


2) The expressions Kopfperlingus and Werverlingrus are not understandable to us. The explanation, which Burkhardt, p. 325, compiles: "Werverlingus: Wirfel, Wiurfeltrager (cf. St. Louiser Ausg., Bd. XII, 1522, § 17)", does not satisfy us. 

3) In the text': "cutiapelisatum (?)", where again we have to guess.

To Albrecht, Duke of Prussia. 


Luther thanks the duke for his gracious memory and reports on German affairs. Death had put an end to the evil plots of Duke George. 1) On the other hand, he complains that the Archbishop of Mainz and other bishops do not turn to it and King Ferdinand and the Bavarians persecute the gospel. 


From Faber's collection of letters, p. 21, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 190 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 231. 


G. and Fr. in Christ. Sublime, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! Although | did not know how to write anything special to E. F. G., but because E. F. G. has so graciously sent me greetings through their envoy and asked about my health, also requested several times before, where | could, to write to E. F. G., | have written this letter of thanks, so that | will not be so rude. | have written this letter of thanks, so that | may not be so rudely scolded as a despiser of E. F. G.'s gracious favor, and | thank E. F. G. most humbly for this gracious will. We do not know anything about the new newspaper, except that God has done a special work with Duke George's death; for he had it in mind that God would have had to defend, or Germany would have come to all misery. Now, however, God has given peace and has put an end to the evil man's diabolical intentions, even though the bishop of Mainz and other bishops do not turn to such a horrible, terrible example. 


1) On March 30, Duke George of Saxony offered his brother that he would cede the government to him during his lifetime if he renounced the Lutheran doctrine. Henry rejected this offer. The latter then made a will in which he appointed Henry his heir, but on condition that the religion in the country remain unchanged, otherwise the country would fall to King Ferdinand. Henry did not accept this either. Before the councilors could report this to Duke George, he died on April 17, 1539.

Doctor Caspars writes from Leipzig that the printing of Wikel's books continues, especially his Postille,2) and that an abusive and poisonous book has been published against your visitation; therefore it is necessary that you exercise a sharp visitation there.

One would also like to say to the lords of Meissen: Medice, cura te ipsum. If they now atone for their covenants (which have been and still are vain, diabolical, bloodthirsty ruthlessness), then we want to know how to prove our necessary and defensible covenant against their murderous rampage, that it is quite just and right, regardless of the fact that they think themselves so wise that they can well direct all splinters, forgetting their beam, just as if the Holy Spirit could not hit their wise head even in the mortar. Summa: if they should write against me, Luther, they must need less of such high wisdom, or hear: Brother, are you painted? you are well known.

To the honorable, virtuous woman Katharinen Meizlerin, citizen of Bresla, my favorable good friend. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Honorable, virtuous, dear wife! | could not refuse to write to you and, as much as God gives, to comfort you in writing, after | had well thought 


2350 


that this cross, which God has now laid upon you through the departure of your dear son Kilian, will press you hard and hurt you; as a man should naturally and justly grieve, especially in such close blood and flesh. For God did not create us to feel nothing, or to be stone and wood, but wants us to mourn and lament the dead, otherwise it would be a sign that we have no love, especially for our own, but that it has a measure. For the dear Father tries us by this, whether we also can love and fear him, both in love and sorrow, also whether we can give him back what he has given us, so that he may have cause to give more and better. Therefore, | ask you to recognize the gracious, good will of God and to bear such a cross patiently to please Him, and to think with heartfelt faith what a cross He Himself has borne for you and all of us, compared to which our crosses are nothing or ever so small. You should also be comforted by the fact that your son has become a pious, quiet man, that he has departed from this shameful world in a very Christian and blessed way, that God may very well have wanted to secure and protect him from greater evil. For it is such an evil, dangerous time that we should all say with Elijah and Jonah: "I would rather be dead than live." Let them mourn for whom their children so shamefully perish and go to the devil. This is heartache, as David must suffer for his son Absalon. Your son is with our Lord Christ, in whom he has fallen asleep, and you thank God of grace that he has so graciously taken your child to himself, which is better for him than that he should be highest in the court of emperors and kings. May God, the Father of all comfort, abundantly strengthen your faith with His Spirit, Amen. Thursday after Visitationis Maria [July 3] 1539. Martinus Luther.

Luther was told that he would find the church in Pomerania, perhaps in Pomerania, where five expelled preachers had been recalled from Lubeck after the death of Duke George. Luther apologizes for not having written himself due to indisposition.

Ordination certificate for Johann Nandelstat. 


The original is at the University Library of Erlangen. Printed in J.C. Irmischers Handschriftensammlung der Universitatsbibl. zu Erlangen. 1852, p. 358 and in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 227 f. 


Johann Nandelstat brought letters to us, which showed that he was called to be a minister of the Gospel in Schmolln (Smollen), and testified that he led an honorable and godly life. But since he desired public ordination from our church, we found, after investigating his scholarship, that he holds the pure and catholic doctrine of the gospel, which our church also teaches and confesses, and that he has an abhorrence of all fanatical opinions, which are condemned by the judgment of the catholic church of Christ. He also promised that he would faithfully present the pure doctrine we profess to your people. Therefore, since our ministry must not be lacking to the neighboring churches, and the Council of Nicaea has decided in a godly manner that ordination should be desired by the neighboring churches, we have commanded this John, by public ordination in the church, to the office of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments, according to his calling. Therefore we commend him to the church in Schmolln and ask that the Holy Spirit govern the ministry of this John for the glory of God and our Lord JEsu Christ and for the salvation of the church. Given at Wittenberg, on July 6, Anno 1539.

To the most illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Lord John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg, my most gracious lord. 

G. and F. in Christ and my poor Father Noster. Most noble, highborn prince, most gracious lord! The wicked boy Wolrab of Leipzig, who until now has printed all the disgraceful books against us, 1) and distributed them with all diligence, has undertaken to reprint our German Biblia, and to take the bread out of our mouths. Now E. C. F. G. know how unreasonable it is that the knave should use our work and food for his benefit and our harm, so that it would happen that he would earn with his wickedness that our work would still have to serve him for the best for his unpunished evil, dishonor and blasphemy. Therefore, it is my humble request that E. C. F. G. want to help that such great evil of Wolraben would not have to enjoy such a high level of his malice, and that E. C. F. G. would help that our work would still serve him for his unpunished evil and blasphemy. C. F. G. subjects would not have to pay so heavily for their food and fare. No matter what else disturbs me, that the blasphemer and disgraceful printer should so abuse my sour work, perhaps even mock it; for what he has earned with his pressure against God and us, | will command God. So it would not be unreasonable, if the printers in Leipzig, who have so far enriched themselves long enough with their defamatory books, would also have to refrain for a while from enriching themselves even more with our books and from corrupting ours; for it is good to reckon, because the markets in Leipzig can all sell a thousand copies before ours.

Honorable, virtuous woman! | have now (it is right for me) written to you twice on account of your son John, who has asked you through me as a pious child, to show yourself motherly (as you owe), and to give your will that he may take the maiden in marriage, so that he may do his filial duty enough, as Samson did towards his parents. | have also indicated how | could no longer keep it, but consider it good, because | also mean him faithfully, that he should come out of the journey; for | see that his studies are hindered, and may nothing good come of it, where you wanted to be so hard. For | also do what | do in honor of you; and is here his equal, a legitimate child, of good people. Moreover, consider also that it is not to be suffered to move other people's children with love, and then to leave them without cause, which would be difficult for you to suffer from your children: so is it with others, especially where it is marital. | have also written further and advised that you should not refuse this, so that we are not forced to continue anyway. For | have written that children should not be free without the will of their parents, but again | have also written that parents should not hinder children. And all in all, | cannot repeat everything | wrote to you earlier, and | am quite surprised that | do not get any answer. It is difficult for me that my table companion should ape our citizen-daughter, that | still ask,

You must give a good answer quickly, or we must do as much as we can to prevent trouble. You are sufficiently requested; if parents do not want, the priest must want. If you are worried about where he will feed himself, you should think that God must be trusted, who alone feeds the married state, so | will not let John live, even though he himself, God willing, can get along well without my help. Please, therefore, let yourself be found, for | am also tired of writing so often, in which you have no reason to refuse; otherwise | should think that you would hold me against your son in this way: that would not be dear to me, because | am always cordial with yours.

Ordination certificate for Wenceslaus Kilmann. 

From "Neue Beitrage von Alten und Neuen Theologischen Sachen, 1761," p. 285, in Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 55. 

Wenceslaus Kilmann came to us and presented a credible testimony, which testified that he led a godly and honorable life, which had been known to the witnesses for a long time. Since he had been called to the office of teaching the Gospel and administering the sacraments in a neighboring church in Baserin,1) he requested ordination from us. Therefore, after examining his scholarship, we found that he was well versed in the summa of Christian doctrine, diligently studied the prophetic and apostolic writings, and held the opinion of the Catholic Church of Christ. We also saw that his gifts were suitable for teaching. And he promised that he would prove himself diligent and constant in teaching, and faithfully present the unadulterated doctrine which our church professes, We have there 





1) Passerin near Luckau in Lower Lusatia. 


He confirmed the calling of this Wenceslaus and commanded him by ecclesiastical ordination to teach the gospel and administer the sacraments according to his calling. For it is commanded by God fl Tim. 3,10.] that the churches should examine and ordain the ministers of the Gospel, and set before other churches suitable regents, and the Synod of Nicaea has godly and thoughtfully decided that the churches should seek ordination from neighboring churches. But ordination is not to be sought from any people who persecute the gospel of Christ; they are to be avoided as accursed men (anathemata), as Paul says [Gal. 1:9.], "If any man preach you gospel otherwise, let him be accursed." Therefore, by divine decree and the testimony of the Council of Nicaea, it is certain that our ordination is valid. Therefore we commend this Wenceslaus to godly churches, and implore that the Holy Spirit may govern his ministry for the spreading of the glory of God and our Lord JEsu Christ and for the salvation of the church.

In Herings Geschichte der i. J. 1539 im Markgrafthume MeiBen und dem dazu gehdrigen thuringischen Kreise erfolgten Einfihrung der Reformation. GroBenhain 1839. p. 75-77 from the original in the Dresden main state archives. Then given completely corresponding to the original by J. K. Seidemann in Niedners Zeitschrift fir die historische Theologie 1846, Heft Ill, p. 419 to 421; from it in the Erlangen edition, Vol. 56, p. XLVI f. and in De Wette-Seidemann, Vol. VI, p. 229. (Only inscription, signature and seal are from Luther.). 

To the noble, highborn prince and lord, Henry, Duke of Saxony, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my gracious lord. 

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ before. Sublime, highborn, gracious Prince and Lord! Although | do not doubt that Your Grace is Himself most inclined, in praise of God, to order and provide for the churches according to need, as God has especially commanded the potentates and rulers to do, | can nevertheless well assume that such a great work will have much hindrance, for which reason | have caused Your Grace to be honored with this submissive writing. faithful and Christian opinion with this humble letter, and to request that E. F. G. graciously allow the visitation to proceed and be carried out in all points in accordance with the instruction, which, as | am informed, has been set with good measure and somewhat less than the instruction of the visitation, which was issued before this time in M. G. H., the Elector 2c., churches; and in this, we want to consider E. F. G. as a praiseworthy Christian prince, as highly and noticeably situated at the beginning of this church order, which now only has a great stir, and will be a great consolation to the countryside and all the pious, if they will notice that a good, consistent order is being made, and such seriousness will make the opponents' defiance less. 

So the matter demands of itself that the churches be ordered diligently now and in the beginning, for | know that many parishes stand unoccupied, much loaded with unfit persons. 








If the visitators should not follow the instruction in these common and necessary points, it would follow that many parishes would not be appointed at all, that there would also be inequality of doctrine for lack of competent persons, from which there would be much confusion among the poor people and rejoicing among the opponents. And that some think that it is enough to abolish abuses in the beginning alone, and that it is not necessary to investigate further which persons are there and how to provide for them: this is much different; for in the beginning it is most necessary to work as much as possible with great earnestness, so that one has capable persons, to lay good foundations of doctrine, and to plant right faith and unity. 

So also no consistent order can be made, so the persons do not have supply. 

Since the Holy Father knows that this is the highest service of God, which is especially commanded to princes and potentates, to promote the Gospel and to order the churches, the Holy Father wants to let the visitators follow the instructions and graciously keep them. Also, no one can complain with fairness if help or allowance is ordered to the parish priests from other foundations, because all divine and human rights teach and command that help should be given primarily to the parishes and schools, as St. Paul says: qui servit altari, vivat de altari, and the poor church is not obliged to feed its persecutors in foundations and monasteries. 

Our Lord Christ promises rich rewards to all those who help and support the servants of Christian doctrine, saying: "Whoever gives a drink of water to the least of these for the sake of doctrine will truly receive a reward," so E. F. G. know how Ezekiel is adorned with glorious victory, who in his time established right doctrine again, and created entertainment for the people so that they could walk in the doctrine, as the text says, 2nd Paralip. 31: Ut possent vacare legi Domini. So there is no doubt that God will preserve, protect and graciously bless E. F. G., and therefore all pious Christians will ask and call upon Him for E. F. G., and the

Because God has commanded such a prayer, it is undoubtedly powerful and will be heard, therefore | also ask our Lord Christ to strengthen and preserve E. F. G. in body and soul. Dat. Wittenberg, on the day of Jacobi [July 25] 1539. E. F.G. subservient Martinus Luther.

The pastor Andreas /nstitoris at St. Helena in the county of Thurocz took a copy of the letter in the archives of the Newa family, and his son Johann shared this copy in 1687 with the pastor Johann Burius at Karpfen, who incorporated it into his handwritten Micae historico-chronologicae under the year 1539."

Christ. For your reasons are those of Zwingli, against whom we have written many things, but in German, and by God's grace have converted many. 1) For what inconsistency is there in believing that the body of Christ is in heaven and in the sacraments at the same time? Is it difficult for the Almighty God to do what seems unbelievable to us? John 3:13 says: "No one leads to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven." If he was in heaven when he walked on earth, how can he not have been in different places at the same time? To whom this is unbelievable, how will he believe that God is man? how that in the body of the Virgin the true God is essential at the same time? how that One Person of the very simple (simplicissimae) Godhead became flesh, to the exclusion of the other two? The mysteries of faith are handed down and accepted by the Word, not grasped or indicated by reason. It is very much, indeed, wholly reason, which admits that the same body cannot be in different places. But reason is blind, and what is impossible before it, GOtte is exceedingly easy. For me there is not the same body in heaven and on earth; but who am |? For me there is not a great body in a small piece of bread; but who am I? "With God no thing is impossible" [Luc. 1, 37.]. Not he who understands, but he who believes will be saved. And again: If you do not believe, says Isaiah Cap. 7, 9. you will not know, neither will you remain. That would be a very miserable God, who does not say or do what is unbelievable to us 2). So only finally there would be no article of faith, if it were to be judged according to our reason. But since | am busy, | am forced to break off here. Again and again | ask you to hold on to the old faith of the church, until | will more abundantly refute your reasons in time.

To Ludwig, Count of Oettingen. Luther reports that Georg Karg has been ordained and recommends him. This is the answer to No. 2564.

To the well-born, noble Lord Ludewig the Elder, 

Count of Oettingen 2c., my gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Well-born, noble, gracious Lord! As E. G. desires, Magister Georgen Kark has ordained me according to Christian apostolic wisdom, as he will report to E. G., also Magister Philippus has written everything without doubt, | quite humbly command the same Magister Georgen to E. G., for he is a finely learned man, and even though he is still young, | hope that God will create much fruit through him; for he has seen and well heard our teachings and ways (which, praise to God, are indeed Christian), and has diligently kept to them (1).

Luther urges them to reform the monastery of Ménchen- Nienburg.

To the noble, highborn princes and _ lords, Johanns, Georgen, Thumprobst zu Magdeburg, and Joachim, Gebrider, Firsten zu Anhalt, Graf zu Ascanien und Herren zu Bernburg, my gracious lords. 


God and peace in Christ. Sublime, high-born princes and lords! | recently visited my Lord, Prince Wolfgang, E. F. G.'s dear cousins. Among other things: Among other things, there was talk about the monastery of Miinche-Neunburg, that there the mass and all other idolatries are still in use, and that the abbot treats the goods as his own, steals cash and sells hereditary goods 2c., that | was surprised that the abbot with his own under E. F. G. is allowed to be so modest (thar), since the saying of St. Jacob [4, 17] also applies to them: Scienti donum et non facienti peccatum est illi. Because now such monastery is under E. F. G. rule, and E. F. G. GOtte is responsible for it. Since such monastery is under the rule of E. F. G. and E. F. G. GOtte are guilty of controlling the blasphemy of his name and promoting his honor, | humbly ask E. F. G. not to watch Satan any longer nor to allow his courageous will (for he cannot excuse himself because of his ignorance) under E. F. G., so that they do not make themselves partially responsible for other people's guilt. That they pretend that it is an imperial foundation is true, as far as it concerns the freedom of persons and goods, or perhaps of goods in part. But the idolatry was neither founded nor could be founded by any emperor, but the emperors were deceived by the monks, that such idolatry, previously invented by monks, was afterwards liberated and granted. 2) On the other hand, our Lord God's foundation is established from above, that is, Sanctificetur nomen tuum; to which all foundations that are called Assumere nomen Dei in vanum must give way, and no imperial freedom nor confirmation can defend them, for the emperor himself must also be under the foundation of God and destroy the devil's foundation, as he would do if he knew. Now they want to mend themselves with the emperor's protection and mix the spiritual with the secular, if they have previously trampled the emperor and all secular things underfoot,

Grace and peace! Also I, my dear Jonas, cannot recognize from your so many letters that my letters were handed over to you, except one. But that may be either coincidence or Satan's fault. By the way, | recommend my brother-in-law, Haus von Bora, to you. You can say well for him that he is a sincere, honest and reliable person, just as you know him. I, too, am writing for him to the most illustrious Prince Heinrich, certainly not for a charlatan and braggart who accomplishes everything with words, but with deeds brings about the opposite in a nonsensical way, as you know this race of noblemen (centaurorum), who nowadays, through God's curse, are growing and multiplying in such a way that in a short time they are filling the earth with iniquities, that in a short time they will fill the earth with iniquity and make everything corrupt, so that it is necessary that the world be cleansed, not by a flood of sin, but either by some great conflagration, or (what | would prefer) by the fire of the last day.

The parish is to be granted an allowance of 15 fl. per year. Now we know, as found in both visitations, that such a parish has a small village and no branch, the people of the village are not wealthy, and the field is also not so enjoyable that a priest could drive it himself and keep servants and horses on it, we also could not put some allowance on the people because of that. Because we have now looked over the registration itself and considered the income, and find that all together it does not amount to much more than twenty guilders per year, we ask in humility and submission that E. C. F.. G. should graciously provide the poor man with one florin or fifteen florins annually from the sequestration, considering that such parish is otherwise not close to any other parish in E. C. F. G. Chur in Saxony, and this pastor is now 1) an old man, who should remain unchanged. E. C. F. G. will therefore graciously show himself in this. For the same E. C. F.

The clergy of Zurich to Luther. (Regest.) 


They complain about Luther's writing on conciliarities and churches, in which he unjustly accused Zwingli of Nestorianism. Zwingli had confessed at Marburg in the articles signed by both sides that Christ's person was undivided; likewise in the confession addressed to Emperor Carl at the Imperial Diet of Augsburg, which was written in the last period of his life. He had absolutely nothing in common with Nestorius, but was a godly man and orthodox and a very special lover of Catholic truth. Finally, they recall the letter addressed to Luther on May 4, 1538 (No. 2428), in which they promised to indicate if they missed anything about Luther, so that a firm peace could exist among them, and ask that Luther would accept a better opinion of Zwingli. Signed by: Leo Juda, Caspar Megander, Conrad Pellican, Theodor Bibliander and Heinr.

G. and F. and my poor Pater-Noster. Durchl., hochgeb. F., gn. Lord! D. Jonas has ever wanted me to write to E. C. F. G. in addition to him; for he is interested in the visitation at Meissen, because he is called to it, for the sake of his conscience he has to take care of the souls, and would rather, if E. C. F. G. did not give the order, be rid of everything, as we all are, 


1) This Michael was a school teacher at Torgau. (Burkhardt.) 

2) Major seems to have had a very strong family, since he speaks of 11 persons, whom he had to maintain from the 80 fl. - As a result of the answer given on October 11, Major received the canonicate in St. George's Collegiate Church at Altenburg, which Magister Colditius (Alexius Chrosner von Colditz) had held. (Burkhardt.) 


neither helper nor hitchhiker, for E. C. F. G. Well, it is true, it is much too lazy to do this with the first visitation; and even if the cities with their own help are quite well ordered, there are still more than 500 pastors who are poisonous papists (as he reports), who have all remained unexamined, and confidently put on their horns and defy, because they are left like that; and if they had been abolished on Michaelmas, they would have been easier to dispose of with the income of the parishes, since one must now have more than 4000 (guilders) in excess to dispose of them, as they should also have calculated from the nobility. Should now the other and right visitation be delayed and remain, in which one must provide the church with the doctrine: then with this visitation nothing is applied to such poisonous pastors, but made worse. Therefore, for the sake of the poor souls, of whom many thousands are unaccounted for among such pastors, we ask that E.C.F.G. help as much as it can. If they want to take their own visitators from their own, then so be it; if not, the sooner, the better we can get rid of them and wait for ours. There are too few of them in such a large regiment, which they also have, but they are neglected and hinder us, because we are bombarded with letters, and there is neither a place nor a person where people can be instructed in such church matters. It is very difficult at the moment. E. C. F. G. will know well how to advise in this matter. So we also hope that there will be more leisure in Dresden after the stag rut. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befehlt, Amen. Friday after Crucis (Sept. 19) 1539.

Also, | do not have to keep this from you, lest | regret it afterwards: | am so well reported that | have to believe how D. Jacob is striving to return to that principality; if this were to reach M.

Friday after [Sept. 19]. 1539. M. Luther. 

Hans Luft has shown me how the Bible would now be printed on large median paper here, which we want to overrun again, not to make it better, but to correct the printer's mistakes: the Princes of Anhalt have learned this, and want three copies of parchment printed underneath; one copy (for there will be 340 sheets and so many calfskins) will cost 60 fl.

Spalatin to Luther and Jonas. About the filling of the parish position in Oschatz. 


From Neudecker's collection after Cod. Chart. Meiningensis, p. 27, in Burkhardt, p. 330. 

God's grace and peace through Christ! In what a wonderful way it made the Lord M. Caspar 





Léner torments and almost consumes, venerable and highly learned men, that he has suffered rejection everywhere in such an unseemly manner, since he was Called to Leipzig, | cannot explain to you in words. And | have no doubt that he will seriously confront those whom he considers suspicious. And indeed, it would have been much 1) better if he had not been called to Leipzig, than that he had been rejected so very carelessly, so very thoughtlessly, so very hopefully. Moreover, | see that they would like to disparage Oschaiz in the highest degree, as a place that is neither suitable for him nor for his own, although he, even through a single sermon, has so won the hearts of the Oschatzers, - which | clearly recognized from their letter addressed to me, which | received yesterday, - that they still very much want him to be their pastor before many others. But M. Caspar Léner rejects it completely, perhaps either because he wants to stay with the Oelsnitzers, or completely abandon the service of the word, which he would do if he did not fear the wrath of God. That is how much he is hurt by the impropriety of the Leipzig rejection. And what was the point of the called one being rejected so lightly? Therefore, only this remains, that either M. Wolfgang Baumheckel or M. Johann Buchner be sent to the Oschaizers, until the confirmation of the most illustrious Duke Heinrich, although | fear very much that M. Johann will be very contemptuous of Strobel, perhaps also M. Wolfgang, if Wolfgang's title of Master and name do not serve to save him. Therefore | ask for Christ's sake that you immediately write to me as well as to the people of Oschatz, so that they no longer lack the shepherds of the churches. For however the matter may turn out, the parish of Grétschen near Pegau will fit neither M. Wolfgang Baumhekel nor his wife, because they are completely ignorant of agriculture. Be well and happy in the Lord with all yours, and write again soon for the sake of Christ. In haste, in the hours before daybreak. On September 19, 1539. G. Spalatin.

To Duke Albrecht of Prussia. 


Luther recommends Albrecht Hack from Kénigsberg, who had studied in Wittenberg at the Duke's expense. News about Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, the Turkish War and the danger for the Protestants. 


October 13, 1539. 


From Faber's collection of letters, p. 25, reprinted in De Wette, vol. V, p. 209 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 242. 

G. and F. in Christ! Sublime, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! Because Albrecht, the letter-writer, is returning to E. F. G., | did not want to let him come without a letter (as he also desires), and | hereby humbly command the same Albrecht to E. F. G., that E. F. G. will graciously help him in time). 

New newspaper | send a part, as they are printed here against H. Heinrich von Braunschweig, whose unprincely trades come out a lot, and especially the murder of Doctor Embeg or Diligshausen, of which it says here.2) So it is also true that the Turk has won the castle Castell novo on the Adriatic Sea and slain four thousand Hispanics, who were the best warriors of the emperor. It is said that it was the strongest castle of the whole Christendom. So the pope and the emperor had an embassy to the Turks, but both of them were defeated, and the Turk is preparing to attack the pope and the emperor by sea. If it goes away to him, he shall probably take Sicily, Neapolis (Naples) and Rome in the summer. Still our emperor, king and princes are the longer the more senseless on us, want to attack us with the power in the summer (shall be certain), let talk that all their misfortune comes from the Turk, that they let us live, and that God has not long since done such sacrifices and service. Thus France looks with evil confidence on the emperor, England makes its own, takes the name and property of the pope, but strengthens his doctrine and abominations; summa, the devil lets himself be seen everywhere in the world. 


1) Albrecht Hack was employed as a Latin chancery scribe after his return. 

2) The printed newspaper Wider Herzog Heinrich von Braunschweig, which contains the news about the murder of D. Embeg, is neither found with the letter, nor otherwise in the secret archive (De Wette).

See his great majesty, that he is God and Lord of the world. Therefore we may well pray, and E. F. G. may also pray for us in the churches, that the devil's counsel may be turned back, amen. Otherwise, it is truly terrible enough everywhere, except that our Christ lives and reigns forever, although sin and ingratitude, very great and ripe, well deserves everything that is inflicted upon us. We have also had these 6 weeks in these lands such unusual winds and waters without ceasing that many people have been drowned, suddenly many things have been carried away, that one must say it means something, and without doubt not much good. For one despises God's word too much, and hears no one. So may a rod be tied over our skin, God grant with grace, amen. E. F. G. forgive me so long chatter, and be commanded to the dear God, amen.

To Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. 


Luther assures Bucern of his friendly attitude despite his silence. He refuses to write a preface to his Latin postilla. On the Enemies of the Gospel, the King of England and the Emperor. About the complete unbelief of the Italians. 


The original is at Strasbourg in the archives of the church convent. Printed by Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 99 and by De Wette, vol. V, p. 210. German by Walch, vol. XXI, 1465. 

To the highly famous man, Mr. Martin Bucer, Bishop of the Church at Strasbourg, the true servant of the Lord, his exceedingly dear brother in Christ. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | think so, my dear Bucer, that you know how it is not necessary to write to you more often. For you have more leisure and fewer years to keep quiet about the affairs and things with which | am overwhelmed at every hour. Therefore, assume that you have been answered as often as you write to me. For | hope that between us there is a sincere 


2384 


I think the same of all your colleagues whom | ask t greet you on my behalf. | think the same of all you colleagues, whom | ask to greet you respectfully in m name. But it is very pleasant that you do not leave u in ignorance of what is going on among you, especiall in the matter of the cross, that is, the word of th Crucified. The word of St. Peter begins to be fulfilled which says [2 Pet. 2:1.], "They will bring upo themselves swift condemnation.” "They will be lost.’ They again spread great threats and (as they boast effective ones. Let God destroy their plots, as he ha done so far, although our sins, our ingratitude an contempt announce some great misfortune to us. An with us, mau recognizes it as a terrible punishmen that the winds and waters raged in a quite unusua way, now already into the sixth week, so that our ol people do not remember its like. 

Our Crato has asked me for a preface to th Postillen. But | am not experienced in Latin, and eve if |had known it, it cannot be otherwise than that | hav become ignorant of it through the weaning from it, an the long habituation to use the German language. 1) have asked him that he should ask you for it, and thi | still desire. | have asked him that he should ask yo for it, and this | still desire. 

With regard to the King of England, | fear that you hope is futile. We have heard that the Englis themselves, while staying here, complained abou their king and admired our freedom. He had an envo to our prince in these days, but he brought nothing no reported anything that could have indicated any hope May the Lord guide his heart and that of all other king to his glory. 

The prophecies about the emperor are certain that having united with the pope hated by God, he woul lose all happiness and blessings of God. But they pu all this on us. Farewell, and respectfully greet Johan Sturm and Johann Calvin, whose books | have read.

From the Lorenz collection in Strasbourg in Schitze, Vol. Ill, p. 110 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 212. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Our prince does not want this project of his to be published under his name by the printers, and | do not consider it expedient that it should come into many hands. So it seems to me advisable that my advice be published without mentioning the name of the prince; do what you like. | would at least like it to be printed in our country and the copies to be sent to you. We do not want to provoke those of whom we hope that they can be drawn in by prudence, nor is it advisable that those surrender (tradanf) of whom it is to be hoped that they will be able to advise the peace of the church. Meanwhile, the Lord must be asked to strengthen the minds of those who seek His glory. It is indeed a human fear, but, if my heart does not deceive me, one that fears that the glory of God and the salvation of souls might be lost. | am waiting for your answer. You have my opinion; do you conclude from the past to the future. | would have written to my Gerbel, but if it can be done through you, | wish him to receive both the letter and the letter.

Grace and peace! | have received the candlesticks, my dear Wenceslaus, and | give thanks. You have rightly understood my silence; but | would not have kept silent if a messenger had shown himself or demanded letters. 

In no way would | want you to exchange your present position with the one in Leipzig, where there is still debate about who or with what one should feed the servants of the Word.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear devotee, councilor and faithful! We graciously inform you that the Rector, Magistri and Doctores of our University in Wittenberg have now come to us with a letter in which they state that, although the deaths there have been at a standstill for several months, for which reason they had partly hoped that it would not have continued this winter, But the other day, five of Doctor Sebalden's staff fell ill, plus others who died, so many young students are leaving, with a humble request that we arrange for some doctors and magistrates to go to a certain place with a group of students. And although we hope to God Almighty that there will be no further dangerous upheaval, we fear that the university will be dispersed and will not soon be able to be reunited. But since we know to remember that you, Doctor Martinus, since the university went crazy in previous such death runs from Wittenberg, wrote before that such craziness is not caused by the dangerousness of dying, but by some special persons, we graciously request that you diligently and actually inquire how it is due to dying, and if you find that it continues and is dangerous, and if you find that the situation is further and dangerous, that you consider that the university should be moved, report it to us without delay, and although we intend to move the university towards Altenburg, where it would also be able to maintain itself, 1) please inform us of your concerns as to how, in what form and where it should be placed most effectively and kept in these runs. We then want to be heard and know how to show ourselves. In this you do us a gracious favor, and we would not hold you to this, to whom we are graciously inclined. Date at Eisenberg, Friday after Simonis and Juda [Oct. 31] Anno 1539.

To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


Luther asks that the D. Cruciger, whom they wanted to keep in Leipzig, not be let go from Wittenberg. 


Ex Copial. Archiv. Vinar. in the Leipzig Supplement, p. 89, no. 160; in Walch, vol. XXI, 426; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 219 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 55, p. 249. 


1) Added by us. 





Grace and peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! The Council of Leipzig has written to us and requested that we agree to keep D. Caspar Creuzigern with them completely and forever, because he has appealed to our permission, and they also indicate that they will seek this from E. C. F. G., in the good hope that E. C. F. G. will let it happen. We answered that it was not up to us, neither to hinder nor to promote it; therefore, we also push it home to E. C. F. G.. But because D. Caspar has no other way of defending himself against the fierce persistence in Leipzig, than to let himself be heard without any trouble, and to groan at our permission; 2) besides, he writes to us that he would much rather be here, and we also know well that he can be much more useful here, since there is a crowd that will not be in Leipzig for a long time yet, and this school is now done by God's grace, and educates people and still educates them in all countries, which Leipzig cannot imitate so soon: so we take it for granted that D. Caspar could not do as much good in Leipzig as here in Wittenberg, and it would be a pity that he should miss much here and do little there; it may well do in Leipzig a small piece of wood, but such a pole, so that this school is not even exposed, especially because D. Caspar reads in theology. Caspar in theology is a covenant on which | have placed it after my death: so my humble request is, because it lies solely in E. C. F. G.'s approval, E. C. F. G. did not want to let D. Caspar travel from Wittenberg; who knows what God will do in a short time. Such my concern E. C. F. G. graciously wished to hear from me. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befohlen, Amen. Tuesday after All Saints [Nov. 4] 1539. Mart. Luther.

that the newly established school would fall apart. Therefore, Luther and Melanchthon recommend Wolfgang Schiefer and Nicolaus von Coburg for this position. Melanchthon sends a letter to the council of Leipzig concerning D. Cruciger's dismissal and asks him to consider the need of the Wittenberg University, which is in great need of him.

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ beforehand. Most noble, highborn, most gracious Prince and Lord! E. C. F. G. 1am pleased to know that the schoolmaster of Meissen recently wrote to me that the citizens of Meissen are concerned that if he were to be called away, the newly established school would soon fall and disintegrate. | know nothing more about him at this time. He spoke to me about the free school here, and 1) asked whether he would be allowed to attend court, because he was thinking of becoming a free schoolmaster, and for this reason he gladly accepted the school in Meissen. 

Where E. C. F. G. wanted to infer another person, | have hereby listed two unmarried journeymen who are very well known here, and although | have not indicated anything about this matter to anyone, | still believe that each of them is willing to serve E. C. F. G. in loyalty. Thus, they are both of honest morals, of good sense, God-fearing, well-taught and of considerable age, so that | have no doubt which of them E. C. F. G. will choose, who is capable and well to be used. May God grant His grace for this useful and necessary work, and may E. C. F. G. at all times. Date Wittenberg, Nov. 7, 1539.

To the man highly esteemed in the Lord, Magister Georg Spalatin, Archbishop of Meissen 2c., his lovable superior and brother. 


Grace and peace! My dear Spalatin, your fellow bishop D. Jonas is not here. For he has gone away to Schweinitz with his children, as some think, out of fear of the plague, others because he wants to take care of his calculus [stone]. 2) For | hear that in Schweinitz he suffers his Turk and Satan, namely the stone. That is why he does not answer your letters. By the way, with regard to the matter of the virgin Anna and Medler, | still have nothing certain; | thought for sure that it had already ended long ago, since the adversary was so quiet. 3) And | had ordered D. Caspar Creuziger to finish the same with them in Leipzig. | must urge Dell, which | will do shortly. | am very surprised about the letter

2) culculatum == to calculate. In ancient times, arithmetic was performed with small stones.

The Elector demands an expert opinion on whether Georg Major should be granted a year's leave of absence to Duke Frederick of Liegnitz to promote the Reformation. - Luther's answer to this has not yet been found, but its content can be seen in the letter from the Elector to Luther of November 24. 


From Reg. O, fol. 132, n. 5, printed in the Weimar Archives by Burkhardt, p. 335. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We graciously inform you that the highborn prince, our kindly dear uncle and brother-in-law, Duke Frederick of Liegnitz, has now arrived, after his love has intended to have the holy divine word preached with the bestowal of the reverend sacrament in conformity with our Confession and Apologia in S. L.'s country and principality. L.'s country and principality, in need of especially learned, experienced and brave people, that we wanted to have Magister Georg Major at Wittenberg follow us from there, as a friendly favor. Although we did not know any other way, because our grandfather had it ready in his country and had it held until here according to our confession of religion, but because we note that there should be a lack of people for this, we did not want that such Christian work should be prevented on our part, and have given an answer to his love, as you will find from the enclosed copy. Thereupon we graciously request that you speak with D. Jonah, Pomerano and Creutziger about it. If you then consider that the said Major can be removed for a year, it is not against us, but let it happen, where the preacher's chair in our castle church at Wittenberg is ordered to leave, that he go to the Dukes of Liegnitz, and be used for the establishment of Christian doctrine (lar) and religion for a year. We did not want to restrain you in your gracious opinion, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date Weimar, on the evening of Martini [Nov. 10] 1539.

From the baptism of children who are not yet fully born. 


Handwritten in Gotha. From Collect. Loc. Comm. Luth. fol. 43 b, in Buddeus, p. 267; in Welleri Opp. omnia at end, p. 206; from an old copy in a codex Bindseils, Corp. Ref. , vol. 24, XXII and XXVI, fol. 334a, with variations, and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 221. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1299. 


Grace and peace through Christ! Concerning the baptism of children in the womb, my dear Jerome, you yourself judge rightly, as you write: one should not baptize them if they have not been born before. Otherwise, this inconsistency would finally follow, that the fruit, which hardly begins to live and move in the womb, would be baptized for the same reason or because of the danger of the sick mother by pouring water on the womb of the mother. Nevertheless, the women who assist in the birth may do this: they may kneel in prayer and, through the spirit of their faith, command the child in danger in a godly way to God, who is mighty to do more than we ask, no doubt also to give life to the child, on the prayer of faith. But with regard to others who have baptized infants in the past [not yet fully born], | do not want questions to be raised and consciences to be troubled. Let them be left as they are, and meanwhile believe that they are baptized, lest we bring up old things again. We may also command the dead [children] to God. 1) What we have not done, God may do hereafter, namely, by the word of faith those who have grown up, believing that they are baptized, endowed with the Spirit, and so baptize in the Spirit, setting aside the negligence of others in times past. But we give counsel for the future, excuse the past, and take care of that which is quite safe for the consciences on both sides. Farewell and pray for me. On the day before Martinmas [Nov. 10] 1539.

To Eberhard Brisger, pastor in Altenburg, currently in Zeitz. 


Luther excuses his silence. He encourages Brisgern to serve the church in Zeitz confidently, since he has received the necessary gifts from God.2) 


Handwritten in Cod. chart. Goth. 402. f.; in Cod. Closs., and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 282. From the collection of Caspar Sagittarius at Jena in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 114 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 222. 


| do not believe, my dear Eberhard, that you need letters from me, although you anxiously ask for them, because | know that you are strong enough in body and spirit, by God's grace. Again, you know very well that | am too busy to write idle and only greeting letters to each individual and to all friends, since | lack both time and strength for questions as well as for actions in the things to be done. Therefore, you must interpret my silence kindly, more as a service than as a contempt, since you are sure that dll celebrate with us in One Soul and in One Spirit. | am glad that you have been called out to the administration of the church in Zeitz. Continue and be strong, knowing this: "The power of Christ becomes strong in our humiliation." "Because we can do it ourselves, we have no need of his help. And if he would do it without us, he could not do it with us. But so it is the will of God, about which one must neither dispute nor doubt. In the Lord, be well with all of yours, and let us pray for each other. On Monday after Leonhard [Nov. 10] 1539. Yours Mart. Luther. 


2) Brisger was lent to Zeitz because, after he had taken up his office there on November 9, 1539, we see from the letter of the Electoral Council to the Wittenberg theologians of May 21, 1540 and the same answer to it of May 22, that, at that time, the council of Zeitz asked that Brisger be left there and be ordained and confirmed to them as pastor. On June 7, Brisger was back in Altenburg.

(Wittenberg.) November 10, 1539. To Johann Mantel, formerly (weiland)" Church servant in Wittenberg. 


Comfort in the challenge of the fear of death. 


This letter is found in German in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, p. 169; in the Jena edition (1568), vol. VII, p. 371; in the Altenburg edition, vol. VII, p. 400; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XII, p. 533; in Walch, vol. X, 2318; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 222 f.; in the Erlanger, vol. 55, p. 250 and in the St. Louiser edition, vol. X, 2006. - Latin in Schiitze, vol. Ill, p. 113 (without citation of the source)and in De Wette, vol. V, p.224.De Wette has supplied both texts, since he was uncertain which was the original one. We do not doubt that the Latin is the original text, in the old translation on the whole well reproduced, but with various additions. Therefore, we leave the translation of the Latin here. 


To the man highly esteemed in the Lord, Johann Mantel, your servant of Christ and his extremely dear brother. 


Grace and peace in Christ! My dear John, through your intermediaries you have requested a letter on several occasions, through which, as you write, you would like to receive comfort and refreshment. But | have thought that | rather need your letters, which refresh my spirit, since | am already too much tormented with Lot and with you in this satanic and unworthy ingratitude and the frightening contempt of the word of the Savior, seeing that Satan so powerfully possesses the hearts of those who think that they will be the successors in the kingdom of Christ and God. But also for my person (privately) | have my troubles with various plagues and troubles. Therefore, | have so far abstained from writing, or rather | have been prevented from writing to you. | ask, however, that you continue to write to me. 


1) The word weiland (instead of "ehemals") is found in the heading of this letter in the Wittenberg and in the Jena edition. In all editions after the Leipzig one it was simply omitted, because it was taken in the here not permissible meaning: "deceased", but the other meaning: "formerly, before, before then" was not known. Duke Georg writes on 23 Dec. 1524 ina letter to Siegmund von Arras (Seidemann, Erlauterungen, p. 98): "Johann Mantel, der sich weiland Prior vffm Kunigstein nennet." According to Rebenstock, tom. Il, fol. 39a, we will have to look for Mantel in Mulhouse at that time. In 1542 (in April) Luther asked the Elector that the "weak old man" be left with his fiefdom. 





to be remembered in your faithful prayers, just as we are remembered of you. For when you write of death, you know the Apostles' Creed, namely, that the Son of God died so that by his death he might make nothing of the death of all his own. What great thing is it, | pray thee, that we should die? But we should remember that He dies, and dies for us. This is only death, which must so fill our hearts, minds and thoughts that we think nothing lives, not even the sun, but everything died with the Lord Himself, and everything will rise with Him on that day. Therefore, we are to be swallowed up in this life and death with our death and life, and then we will live with Him. He has preceded us from the beginning of the world with His death, that He might receive us when we depart from this life, in which even the wicked do not abide. But you understand this better and more perfectly than I, who am also overwhelmed with so many other kinds of death (mortibus) in these evil and godless times. Greet your relatives with unfeigned love, and be strong in the Lord, be confident and undaunted, and wait for the Lord who is near. On the day before

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther and Melanchthon. 


The Elector sends a letter from the King of France concerning religion and a copy of some articles that Luther and Melanchthon should have admitted (see St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 262, no. 1275), which should have been sent from France to England and were spread out there. Now the Elector demands a reservation about the former, but with respect to the articles, that a rebuttal be issued against it. 


The original concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. O, p. 149, Litt. FFF. 6 Printed by Burkhardt, p. 336. 

U[nsern] G[ruB] before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotees and faithful! We have now received a copy of a letter which the King of France is supposed to have sent out for the sake of our Christian religion. But because we

We do not know for certain, after the persecution has stopped here in France for a while, whether this has been ordered by the king or otherwise practiced by the clergy, to the detriment of the true Christian religion and the gospel and to the disgust of the people, we have nevertheless, in our gracious opinion, not wanted to refrain from informing you of this, so that you may also know how it actually is and whether this has reached you, so that you may inform us. Thus, through our advisors and skilful people, whom we now had in England, several articles have been brought to us, which are also said to have been sent from France to England quite deceitfully and dangerously 1), of which we are also sending you copies. Since such articles seem to us as if one wanted to obscure our Christian confession in some articles and make people's noses wet with them, we graciously request that you, Magister Philipp, consider such articles with your Doctor Martin on your own occasion, overlook such articles, and think about how the things meant and sought by them can be countered and averted by a suitable writing in Latin, so that the adversary's list and evil practices for the preservation of divine truth may be prevented with God's grace. We did not want to restrain you in your gracious opinion and are inclined to you with grace. Date Weimar, Thursday after Martinmas [Nov. 13] 1539. 


No. 2601 November 22, 1539. 


To Conrad Cordatus. 


Luther consoles him in his tribulations. Of the fear of the people during the alleged plague in Wittenberg. 


(Wittenberg.) 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 285. Printed in Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 115 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 225. 


Grace and peace in Christ! The Lord comfort you, my dear Cordatus, who is the Comforter of all in all tribulation, as it is written [Ps. 34:20], "The righteous suffereth much, but the Lord helpeth him out of all," and [Ps. 50:15.] "Call upon me in trouble, and | will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 


1) This passage proves that "the articles" were not sent from England to the Elector, as Seckendorf assumes, but that the envoys had brought them with them, as we have already noted in our edition, Vol. XIX, Introduction, p. 32 d, Note 3. 





But our suffering is nothing compared to that of which we daily say, though with little attention: "Suffered under Pontius Pilate, crucified, died and buried, descended into hell" 2c. Our tribulation, death, hell is that of men, that is, of sinners; that is that of the Son of God, whose death and suffering, by their greatness (if we believed it), should rightly so fill and overwhelm our hearts, ears, eyes, even heaven and earth, that we would hardly feel our death (word) from afar, if there were many thousands of deaths, or rather we would feel nothing. But the weakness of faith is too great, otherwise what is it that a man dies, who is subject to sin and death, in view of the Son of the living God, the righteous and innocent, who is worthy of eternal life, and worthy alone. St. Peter therefore rightly commands us [1 Ep. 4:1.] to arm ourselves with the same mind in our temptations, that though we have suffered all things, we may know that we have suffered nothing in comparison with that sufferer. But Christ is richer in these things in you with His Spirit; in Him you are well. 

The plague has not been here, but a pestilence. Since this is over, everything is safe as long as God wills. Admittedly, there was also a not insignificant lack of mercy of the relatives against their relatives, so that | was tormented extraordinarily, and almost took out more than | had to. It is at this time a strange and new pestilence, since Satan, when he wounds a few with the pestilence, throws down all with incredible fear and flight, something quite monstrous and anew kind [of pestilence] under the gospel which shines so mightily. But you also pray for us. On Saturday after Elizabeth [Nov. 22] 1539. Yours, Martin Luther.

V, p. 226 (see no. 2603). 

To the highly venerable man, Magister Antonius 

Lauterbach, your faithful bishop of the church at Pirna, his brother in the Lord. 


Grace and peace! With regard to what you ask, my dear Anton, about the communicating of the sick, | thought you were sufficiently instructed by the custom of our church, in which you have stayed so long. But | remember this and would like to see private communion abolished everywhere, namely, that the people be taught in the sermon that they communicate three or four times a year and then, fortified by the Word, [confidently] pass away, whatever the cause of death may be. For private communion will finally become an unbearable and impossible burden, especially at the time of the plague. And it is not right that the church should be made so serviceable with the sacraments, especially to those who despise them for so long a time, and afterwards want the church to be ready for them in every case as a handmaid, whom they themselves have never served in anything. But since this has not yet been arranged, you will do as you can. In the meantime, you will communicate the sick alone, if it does not please you to communicate with them, as you have done here. 


but with the protestation that you will do this for a while, but that this will not happen to them forever, because something will be arranged in this matter. 1) "Ketha wants the hewn house door to be as wide as the measure is. The length or height will be determined by the masters themselves. She is not allowed to have any other doors. You should order it the best you can. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen."

To the highly venerable man, Magister August Himmel (Hymel), Bishop of Colditz, his brother who is extremely dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | wonder very much, my dear Augustin, what it is that you have not finally squeezed out and sent the income of my Wolfgang 3) or at least indicated what the cause of the delay is. Now, so that we are not compelled to send to Grimma, you may deliver this interest or income to the pastor in Grimma, to whom it has been written that he is spending it on cloth. 

By the way, D. Jonas informs me that you are required by Mr. Cellarius as a comrade in the work at the church in Dresden; but I, if | knew that you could or wanted to move there, would gladly make an effort to have you dismissed by the prince when | would have recognized that it was your advantage. | do indeed think that housekeeping is difficult for you, perhaps because of farming; but since you do not write anything, | am uncertain about your home.

Grace and peace in Christ! With regard to your visitation, my dear Cellarius, you should behave in this way: If your prince should desire you to take this burden upon yourself, you may say: if they wished to establish a wholesome and constant visitation, that they would certainly like to have you (as people inexperienced in these matters) accompanied by someone of ours who knows the way and the form. Secondly, they will make a mockery of themselves with such a cold visitation, and you can say that ours would suffer it very gladly if they were not forced to such a burden; so much is lacking that they should seek it. For all that they will do such things, they will do only in an effort to help the church and to save 


in the name of the Lord, so that you may at least conduct a cold visitation and, as much as you can, advise the souls, at least push out the poisonous papists. Fare well in the Lord. Wednesday after Catharine [Nov. 26] 1539. Yours Mart. Luther.

To Johann Spangenberg, the servant of Christ in Nordhausen. 


Grace and peace in Christ! Instead of Doctor Oethen 1), D. Jonas sends this M. Nicolaus as a servant of the church, my dear Spangenberg, and this same D. Jonas has asked me to recommend him to you by my testimony. Since | believed that this would not be necessary, | will do it very briefly, since | am sure that you will do more than we desire, in accordance with your own favor, which you cherish toward the least members of Christ, in accordance with Christian brotherly love. Only may you cause 


souls; they would much rather be subjected to these] your northern houses (Aquilonensibus == those exceedingly great burdens. If your courtiers, killed by} jiving in the north) to hold their teachers, who preside 


avarice, should fear the expense at all, you can say that even ours cannot serve the avarice of yours at their own expense, because they spend enough, since in the meantime they neglect theirs and ours here. | have always suspected that the gospel would have a very difficult entrance in this area, since it is completely idolatry, that is, avarice, because Christ says that one cannot serve God and Mammon at the same time. For mammon has completely taken possession of Meissen and holds it, therefore it is impossible that it will be patient against the gospel. But if you do not obtain anything, yes, if you have to visit without us, you may visit. 


over the word, in double honor, as St. Paul teaches, otherwise it will happen in a short time that they will have no people whom they could hold in half honor, if they then wanted to hold them in triple or even tenfold honor, for there is a shortage of workers in the harvest of the Lord. Therefore, those who have may hold on to this, so that they may not later have what they would like to hold on to, for this M. Nicolaus is sent against my will, since | wanted to use his work elsewhere; he is a very good man and at the same time learned. The Lord be with you, and pray for me. Sunday after Catharine [Nov. 30] 1539. Yours, Martin Luther.

Eisleben. December 2, 1539. 


To his sister Dorothea. 


(A fake letter.) 


Luther promises that since they are longing for evangelical sermons, he will preach the first evangelical sermon in RoBla and Ober-RoBla at Christmas. 


This letter, according to a copy which the editor received from the pastor Gupner in Nieder-RoBla, is printed in the Altenburger Ausg., Vol. VIII, p. 994; in the Leipziger, Vol. XXII, p.568; in Walch, Vol. XXI, 428; in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 231 and in the Erlanger, Vol. 55, Since the Sacrament was already administered in 1526 in Ober-RoBla in both forms, De Wette I. 0. places this letter in this year; but it would be strange if the Sacrament should have been administered correctly and yet preceded by a Protestant sermon. Therefore, Seidemann, in De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 544, note 5, places the letter in the year 1529, but in the "Luther Letters" published soon after, p. 11 and p. 44, he most definitely declares it to be spurious. Dorothea Luther was married to Paul Mackenrodt in Nieder-Rossla; his name was not Balthasar, as the inscription of this letter calls him. See No. 2073. - We leave the letter out.

The Elector reports that the ratification of the Frankfurt Peace Treaty, according to the Archbishop of Lunden's report, is still dependent on the Emperor, therefore it is necessary to make preparations for the theological defense of the Augsburg Confession, and for the end to assign theologians to the Schmalkalden Day (March 1, 1540), who are to work out a well- considered advice for the settlement. He sends Bucer's and Wicel's action to Leipzig, so that they can take a look at it. The most distinguished theologians are to be written to, as Link, Osiander, Dietrich, Brenz, Rhegius, Probst, Aepinus, Amsdorf, Bucer and comrades, Schnepf and the most distinguished theologians of the landgrave, in order to hear their concerns about the council proposal; if possible, a meeting with them is also to be organized. During the negotiations in Schmalkalden, Luther is to stay in Eisenach.

Ps. 27, 14. (Ds. 26.) "Wait upon the LORD, be of good courage, and wait upon the LORD." 


A wonderful saying. It is commanded that one should wait for God, who is everywhere the most present, as if he were absolutely nowhere present (nusquamtissimus); but thus a godly heart feels in

of temptation, while the wicked imagine that he is very near to them, in the greatest certainty and presumption, as Jeremiah says: You are far from their hearts. 

The opposite for the ungodly: Fear the Lord, be dismayed and let your heart tremble, fear the Lord. But the wicked do not believe this, just as the godly do not hope for the opposite as it should be. And yet it is true: The Lord is near to those who fear him, and knows the hidden things from afar. Thus it comes about that neither the godly wait for the gracious God, nor the godless fear the threatening one. With both, this happens only partially and to a very small degree.

How much better would it have been for each of them to be under princely protection, since the nobility corrupts, eats and devours each other so unkindly? Four noblemen have now squandered three hundred florins on Martin List for 20 florins, as one complains, by riding in the inn: how much better it would have been if each had paid 5 florins and redeemed poor List! This also happens elsewhere. What devil has given the nobility such power to trick, see and plunder each other without the knowledge and will of the overlords? If Kolhase did it, as a murderer, it would be small. This is what one nobleman does to another under princely escort and protection. If the princes do not punish here, God will punish them all with us. And who knows why our affairs go so crooked, perhaps our offices also go crooked before God (yes, not perhaps), and one irritates the other against each other. Forsooth, the princes are guilty of preventing such things, and you are guilty of advising and doing such things, or you will be guilty of such harm and wantonness. | intend to write a public letter to the princes about these matters.

God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ before. Most Sublime, Highborn, Most Gracious Prince and Lord! E. C. F. G. we humbly add that the church has been very diligent in buying grain for the needs of its poor, and the people who have been appointed to do so have been in many places for this purpose. But when finally the honorable and strict Dieterich full Rochau asked to sell grain, he kindly agreed to leave 21 wispel 1) to our church and the poor, so that E. C. F.

countries and people. Thus says the prophet: Frange esurienti panem tuum etc.; and Solomon says: "He who hides the grain will be cursed, but he who sells it will be blessed"; which sayings are to remind everyone to exercise faith, and with this hope to tell others that God will bless us again, give us a gracious year, and feed His poor, as the prophet tells us about the young ravens: Qui dat escam pullis corvorum. For it is said that they are abandoned by their elders; therefore worms grow in the nest, so that the young may be fed in the meantime. Therefore we also ask with diligence that God will have mercy on the poor and give gracious growth for their sake. For this reason, E. C. F. G. will graciously show mercy to the poor here, for nothing is sought there but for great need, and will graciously grant a reported number of grains,

To the Elector Johann Friedrich, together with the other theologians. 


The theologians promised to draw up an objection for the day at Schmalkalden and the settlement negotiations to be held there with the popes. This was done (see St. Louis edition, Vol. XVII, 319, No. 1295), and Luther sent it on January 18 together with his letter to the Elector. This letter is the answer to No. 2611. 


From Cod. Palat. 689, p. 84, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 256; in the Erlanger Ausgabe, vol. 55, p. 272 and (comparing a copy in Cod. Galli, |, p. 50) in Corp. Ref., vol. Ill, 920. 

God's grace and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ before. Most Serene, Highborn, Most Gracious Prince and Lord! E. C. F. G. Writings, concerning the discussion, what in case, if one might come to a settlement, to leave out of external and middle things or ceremonies, we have received in submission together with the Carlowitz Reformation. And although such a patchwork is very dangerous and painstaking, we nevertheless want to bring together our submissive concerns, and E. C. F. G. We also do not consider it necessary to require the other predicators this time, but want to write to them and inform them in writing what we are based on. And there will be little disparity among them. For as far as we understand, the question is not what is to be done about doctrine and necessary things, but only about the outward and middle things. For we hope that princes and estates in this part will finally be mindful not to make a mishap in doctrine and necessary matters. 





The following table shows the number of pages that can be used for this purpose. 

And although some would like to be moved to such a devil's specter, as no doubt the Italians and the French will bring such pebbles - as we know that they are now discussing such pebbles in Rome and Paris - we, by the grace of God, do not want to have anything to do with sophistry, and would much rather put our miserable skin on it. Nor do we want anyone to take care of us who has no desire to do so. What destruction the Concordirn in the Synod of Sirmio has caused in the trade of the Son of God! So now the devil also tries sophistry. 

By the grace of God, the doctrine in our part is so light and bright, and written with such diligence, that it needs no glosses, and that all God-fearers in all countries must confess that it is the right, pure, Christian doctrine. The same is true of necessary and external things, such as the abjuration of all private masses, all invocation of the saints, monasticism, marriage and the use of the sacrament. Since, then, of these two pieces, namely, of doctrine and necessary external things, there is no need for any further discussion, we hope that the third piece of matters of substance will not be the subject of much controversy. Thus, little can be said about it before we hear whether the bishops want to renounce the persecution and accept the Christian doctrine and necessary things. Then one may seek comparison, or mend in means. For how would it rhyme if they were the enemy of doctrine, as they are in principle, and yet should have authority, ordination, jurisdiction. But we want to indicate our opinion about this further in our objections. We also want to bring together our answer and confutation of the bells in necessary parts. For without a doubt, these bells will be the most important action. We cannot see how it is possible for the bishops to drop their idolatry without the pope's permission, unless it were to happen as it did in Cyro. For when Cyrus made war with Croesus, and sought favor and good from the Jonians, that they would not help Croesus, he wished to let them remain in their old freedom, and to give them such

they came to Cyro, since the game had turned and Croesus was captured, and stopped, Cyrus wanted to leave them with their freedom. Then Cyrus gave them this answer. At one time there was a fisherman who whistled a dance for the fish to jump out, but they would not. So he had to make an effort to see them with a yarn. When he brought them to shore in the yarn, they began to jump, as is their way. Then the fisherman said, "No, it has been too long. When | whistled, you did not want to dance; now you want to, if it is not easy for me. So when this part suggested ways and means of settlement, they did not want to: now they will not get there. But, most gracious lord, we want to prepare ourselves, according to E. C. F. G.'s most gracious order, for the written record, and E. C. F. G.'s order. C. F. G. the same and ina conducive manner. We also want to show ourselves to be respectful that we will come to Eisenach at a certain time by further gracious order of E. C. F. G..

Plétzka and Pretzin. January 10, 1540. 


The parishes of Plétzka and Pretzin to Luther. 

The parishes complain that the captain Sigismund Pflug has changed the income and housing prescribed for the pastor by the visitators to his detriment in such a way that it is to be feared that he will "run out of length" and no one will be able to bring him back. They themselves are not able to help their preacher, because the captain is also dealing with them in such a way that they "must perish with wife and children". Therefore they ask for Luther's intercession to the Elector. Luther did this with his colleagues on January 16. 


The original is in the archives at Weimar, Reg. H, fol. 449. Reprinted by Burkhardt, p. 339, who notes: "The acts in Reg. Kk, 196, N. XIX, 1. provide information about the number of 

omplaints. Nothing is known about the course of the matter other han that in 1541 in June the monastery lacked any pastoral care, fas the Domina of the monastery, Magdalena von Hackeborn, complained that ‘for almost a year she had neither a pastor nor a preacher here’. The last pastor to leave was Andreas Ebelius." 


Venerable, reverend Doctor and Father in Christ! With the offering of our willing and guilty services, we poor people may not save E. A. W. although the eee merciful God has given us poor sinners His oly gospel again abundantly out of grace, for which we acknowledge that we are always grateful to Him, and we have received a pious Christian and respected astor by electoral appointment, it is nevertheless the ase that we are now so burdened and distressed with a captain, Sigismund Pflug, that we fear that we poor eople will be deprived of preachers and everything. For although some years ago the electoral visitators rovided for our preacher in such a way that he, ogether with his wife and children, should have a decent apartment, salary and food in the monastery naan However, this year the captain (because he ad a regiment) changed this completely, tore it apart eo despised it, and drove the pious man from his ome in the monastery yard and expelled him, and ow he has to keep house in the village in a loose hut, n which a shepherd barely lived; In it the good man as neither cellar nor chamber. We poor people would ike to change this, if it were within our means, because the captain deals with us in such a way that we poor peeps must perish with our wives and children. We ave to serve daily at court, since we did not serve more than seven days for a whole year before, and we are strangled, martyred and tortured, without any other great curses and blasphemies against God, than we have ever heard before, so that we are cursed and maledicted daily, that we are afraid to come before his eyes. 1) In such a regime with the Lord, the preacher nd with us, we cannot wait for improvement. herefore, venerable Doctor and Father in Christ, E.

We would like to see that we may continue to keep our dear Lord and faithful servant in the word according to God's will, and that the captain be turned away from such devilish rage, for to worry about where this pious, patient preacher will have to run the length, we will be deprived of the word as well as our food, and no one will be persuaded or brought back to it. To prevent this and to ward off the devil, E. A. W. wanted to give us poor people your help and comfort for God's sake, so that we may enjoy this in time, which without a doubt the Almighty God will reward you abundantly through our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We, however, as poor people, always recognize that we owe it to ourselves to deserve such great kindness in addition to all other paternal kindnesses shown, and we ask E. A.

G. and F. Gestrenger, Fester, dear Gevatter! | ask you very kindly to let your parish priest come from you with kindness, so that his complaint does not denigrate you. For in this way you will make noblemen (which has already happened to many) that no priests can be sent to you.

The preacher is not to be preserved, because he already has a vocation to Sponda, which he wants to postpone (if a favorable appointment is made, so that he will be provided with a suitable home for his position, and also preach at a convenient time), and stay with the poor people. Have therefore E. ch. G. Landvogt, Ern Bernhardten von Myla, knight, and asked to have the order of our, the visitators, kept in force and unbroken, considering that because of the preaching at inopportune time and hour, as mentioned above, great harm and neglect must happen to the poor people; but the same he Landvogt, to do so at this time, had a reservation. We are in no doubt, however, where E. ch. G. would give him a gracious order (who has always been very diligent in matters of visitation), he would know how to keep all obedience. We therefore ask in all humility and submission that E. ch. G. will have gracious understanding, and provide that the ordinance with sermons, as it was not made to us_ without forethought, may remain in force and unaltered, so that the poor people will not be neglected, and thus [neither] E. ch.

G.'s humble opinion, where the present preacher of the place would turn away, that we would not easily get his like there again, for there is a lack of all pious, learned and faithful preachers. Your ch. Your Grace will therefore graciously show Himself to be merciful, so that the preacher may remain at his prescribed residence and maintenance, and may hold his office, as imposed on him by us, unwaveringly at the appropriate time, the reward of which will be worthy of God Almighty.

Venerable, Respectable, Esteemed, Favorable Lord and Dear Father! Our very willing and diligent services are always before Your Eminence. We consider it unnecessary to tell Your Eminence how and in what form the monks, in the beginning of the evangelical doctrine, subjected themselves to resist the same holy divine word, and still do. 

Since Your Eminence has sufficient experience of such evil practices, and we and our whole parish are not without harm now and every day being informed how the rulers of the parish and monastery court with us, namely the monks, at the time of the next visitation held the best income of the parish, also the perpetual endowments of the altars in our two churches, of which we had little knowledge due to the deceitfulness of monastic cunning, concealed, and the lowest, most laborious income was declared to the lords of the visitation at that time (only divine word intended for reduction), because of which now and then the respectable and worthy gentlemen, our pastor and deacon, as well as other servants of the little youth, have to suffer great lack and loss of their faithful, laborious and industrious service to their content, and, since now (praise God) the harvest is great, but the laborer (inherited) little, to go to other places for richer pay, with demolition and damage to our poor churches and their stupid consciences, are urged and caused, and although the durchl., highborn, gn. Lord, the Elector, at our humble request last time graciously improved the salary of our church servants with 20 fl., it does not suffice, because the first salary was so small, even to a considerable amount.

Now from such income one must pay to the schoolmaster

Now, God knows, we would like to help and be helpful with the income of the common caste; Thus, the rulers of the same have had to build a hospital, which never existed before, item the schoolmaster, item the deacon, new houses from the ground up, quite and probably with great expense, moreover, they have improved so much on the old rectory and other buildings, which all drew the false monks to themselves, that therefore there is very little supply, without which one must recover the daily penny from the income of several brewing pots and the brick barn, which all bear much construction and expense. And does the necessity ever demand that we should keep with us the faithful workers of the word, for praise and glory to Almighty God and for the betterment of our poor parish, for the consolation of the sinful souls, and yet due to inability, as reported, we cannot do so even without the contribution of our poor citizens. Therefore, we are compelled to complain about all this, our need and concern, to no one but God Almighty and the most illustrious, highborn sovereigns and sovereign princes, our gracious and most gracious lords, and also to E. E., our favorable dear Lord and Father, with comforting confidence. 3) 


and coadjuvants about 20 fl. per year; with what do you maintain the buildings of the church? Diacon's income is 25 fl., 1-1/2 times grain, Beiger measure; schoolmaster's income is 23 fl., 1-1/2 times grain, which grain the schoolmaster has to bring in with toil and expense at half and whole mills with many useless words. The priest's income is assessed at 70 fl., including 13-1/2 fl. 3- 1/2 gr. money interest, the other is grain, barley, oats and decem (tetzen) on some fields on the Elbe, and the priest has to collect all this with a lot of expense in the villages at individual mills and bushels, and hear many useless words from the rude farmers (paurn). If the Elbe floods, as often happens, the Decem is lost, and has to borrow the grain until the next year, and in sum, it is a laborious reward for faithful work. In addition, he has several firths of hay and wood. The coadjutor has 20 fl. Item 2 fl. find- wage (vynt lon) and some bread; not much more than 60 fl., belonging to the parish in the villages. The hospital has not one cent of income; moreover, our most gracious lord, the Elector, has graciously decreed 21 fl. and it will be given to each servant annually. 

2) In the text: "ab sie sich ob"; should probably mean: "ob sie sich ab". - "ab" -== from. 

3) On February 13, Luther addressed his intercession to the Elector, and an investigation of the facts was ordered, but no resolution was made until the beginning of May: Thereupon, on May 3, the council of Belgern repeated its request and asked for 100 fl. and some fathoms of wood, whereupon on May 24, the council was granted 80 fl. and 20 monasteries of wood, but on revocation, annually.

And because the spiritual goods should be donated for the preservation of the poor wretched and for the promotion of the holy divine word, our most diligent, earnest and loud (petition) for God's sake is addressed to Your Eminence, that Your Eminence would heed our need and request, that we and our poor parish be granted the right to the sovereign, high-born princes and sovereigns of the Holy Roman Empire. Our gracious and most gracious lords, request that their chur- and princely sovereigns pay the income of the parish. Our most gracious and gracious lords request that their sovereign and princely sovereigns from the income of the parish and monastery estates with us, which are supposed to be in part mild alms from our ancestors, provide our common treasury with one hundred fl. annually, or else what their sovereign and princely sovereigns recognize. G. recognize, would be graciously helpful (behilfen). By God's help and the counsel of pious people, we have decreed this and will distribute it again annually, so that the Almighty God may be praised, His holy Word may be promoted, the poor little youth may be provided with pure teaching, and the poor wretched people may be provided with a fair amount of hospital care. And the benevolent God will reward all of this abundantly to Your Eminence. Thus, for your sake, we owe it to you day and night, to the best of our ability and diligence, and we do so with great pleasure. Date Belgern, the Tuesday after Estomihi [Feb. 10] Anno Dom. 1540.

Formula of absolution. 

This form of the general absolution, written by Luther himself, is printed in Hormayr's Taschenbuch fir die vaterlandische Geschichte and in De Wette- Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 245. - Probably this is the formula of which Melanchthon writes to Veit Dietrich on February 15, Corp. Ref, vol. Ill, 957. It seems to have been put (for Osiander's sake) for the Nurembergers, because Melanchthon sent the autograph to Dietrich. Cf. Corp. Ref., I. c. 954 and 955. 

Dear friends, because we are all mortal, no hour of death is certain, so humble yourselves before God, confess in your hearts that we, all poor sinners, are in need of His grace and forgiveness every moment. And if today or tomorrow God would require someone among you to leave this pit of misery, then I, as a pastor (preacher), by His command absolve all who are here now and hear God's word, and with true repentance of their sin believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, from all sin in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, amen. Go in peace, whether you live or die.

The Pope's position is that they do not want to give in on essential matters, and he asks them to make their opinion known to them as well.

Ref., Vol. Ill, 955, No. 1928) tells Veit Dietrich on Feb. 12 that "the summa of our opinion is written in a letter" that will soon reach him. 

To Mr. Wenceslaus Link, Doctor, Mr. Andreas Osiander, Mr. Thomas Venatorius, Mr. Veit Dietrich and their other colleagues who teach the Gospel in the church at Nuremberg, his extremely dear brothers in Christ. 

Hail! If only God would have the churches everywhere to agree on the right doctrine of the Gospel, as your church, by God's grace, has been preaching Christ with us in one voice for many years. We do not doubt, however, that this agreement has been beneficial to many godly minds and has served as an example for many churches. But what is more desirable, what is sweeter to a godly heart, than to see flourishing churches in which God is rightly worshipped and the salutary doctrine is presented, and whose praiseworthy examples, to use a word of Paul, glorify the glory of Christ? Since we are most desirous of maintaining harmony forever, we thought it necessary to consult with you at this time, since it is believed that consultations on the settlement of public disputes are imminent. For the [bishop] of Lunden has written to our princes that the emperor is coming to Germany, not to provoke a civil war, nor to credence the bishops with the blood of the blessed to drink, but to discuss how to establish harmony by mutual yielding (moderatis rationibus), and he has exhorted ours to think diligently in what matters yielding is a firm and lasting 








could promote peace. It is a great praise for Emperor Carl, if in truth one assumes that Christ's honor is glorified and the salvation of the whole church is advised. For itis a glorious word in tragedy that is said of an excellent ruler: To advise the fatherland, to spare the citizens, to refrain from cruel 1) bloodshed, to govern morals, to restore tranquility to the world, peace to his time: this is the highest virtue, this is the way to heaven. But we are moved by many things that we suspect that this rumor is either spread quite falsely, so that the adversaries acquire goodwill and applause among the people by pretending a very beautiful thing, or that an ambush is laid by the pretext of peace negotiations. For first of all, how is it consistent that they want to negotiate peace, although it cannot be achieved that the banishment of Minden is ended, although it is certain that everything is being prepared for war, although the kings are invited to participate in the ungodly and exceedingly shameful alliance that has been made in your city, yes, although the iron minds of the bishops can no more be moved to equity than could be done with Pharaoh? For such obstinacy is wont to accompany blasphemy and murder. But since the will of the emperor is unknown to us 2), we must certainly believe von Lunden that the consultations on concord are not falsely promised, but even these are not without danger. As it is to be desired that Carl in truth and from the heart will that the light of the Gospel be restored, and that he obey the divine voice which preaches to the kings, saying [Ps. 2,10.]: "Let yourselves now be instructed, O kings", so it is to be feared that, 3) as now the courts are full of deceit, it is intended to shower the right doctrine with new deception by an artifice.

At the Sirmium Council, when Constantius sought to reconcile the conflicting churches, not by removing but by concealing error, the Nicene Creed was changed and an ambiguous common word was sought which neither party would reject. It was decided that instead of xxxxxxxx the following should be inserted 

XXxxxx; but shortly thereafter the evil broke out again much more violently, and this very ambiguity created new fights. The same thing will happen now, when the concord will be negotiated. You have undoubtedly seen the Cologne writing, in which more convenient interpretations are attributed to the abuses. And it is considered the praise of a good head to think up these subtle glosses, and so already in Rome and in France the makers of these glosses stand in the greatest admiration. One will therefore take recourse to them: articles will be presented so that the errors and abuses, painted with several colors, will be restored. Perhaps, so that we, won by some bait, will agree, they will also let us have some of our articles. Then they will tell us to care not only for ourselves, but also for other nations that might be deterred from the better doctrine if we were too eager to defend all that is ours. They will say of the dangers of civil wars that it is better to have mediocre churches than none. We know that such words are said in the conventions also by ours, and these reasons are valid among worldly-minded people who fear for their treasures or well-being, of which there is a great number everywhere. Perhaps the intrigues are also aimed at dividing our people, who, as the adversaries see, do not otherwise hold together in the best way. Therefore, there will be some who want to be relieved of worries, expenses and dangers, and for this reason will interpret the emperor's service as the best, and will say that they do not want to quarrel for the sake of other things; a civil war is to be avoided. Since these deceitful proposals for settlement will entail so many dangers, it is truly necessary for the godly, 





They need to bring with them well-equipped and strong hearts, and they also need a firm agreement among themselves. Therefore, in order that we may consult with one another, we have deemed it good that you be informed of the sum of our opinion and our deliberations, and we ask again that you make your opinion known to us. For although there may be among you, 1) as elsewhere, worldly-minded people who judge that these disputes are futile wars of words, useless for the commonwealth and for the life of men, and for this reason take pains to wriggle out of them in any way they can, just as a predatory fish, having swallowed the fishhook, nevertheless escapes by wounding its mouth in order to tear itself free from the hook: these people's judgment is none of our business, nor that of the church; we seek your assent and do not doubt that the will of your church is in agreement with you. But it is most to be wished that the harmony which has hitherto existed between our church and yours may be an everlasting one. 

But we at least have divided the whole discussion into three parts. Either they will request that something be changed in the doctrine, or in external things that are necessary, or in external things that are completely mediocre. With respect to doctrine, we have decided entirely that we will not permit any change in any article of the Confession and Apology, no matter under what pretext this may be. At Augsburg, they had drawn the matter to the point that we should at the same time place ambiguous articles that could be interpreted at will (flexiloquos). The matter was similar to the example at Sirmium. But our things have already been made known and explained with quite a lot of explanations, so that it is sufficiently known what we hold in truth. And if they should miss something, we will present our opinions to them in word and writing. But with them we will by no means put new articles, lest the truth, which was clearly indicated before, should now be buried by new circumlocutions. If they

seek the truth, as they boast, they may agree with the correctly developed teachings. If they only deal with it by pinching off something of the prestige of our doctrine by new subtleties, then we want to flee them as hateful intriguers. It says 1) the old man in the comedy, how one can have the usurer to the mockery by the trick with the day, where the old month changes with the new (de the xxx xxx xxx). From the church such quibbles should be far away; far be also that word of Sinon: 2) 

Aut versare dolos, aut certae occumbere morti [either use intrigues, or succumb to certain death]. It behooves us rather to offer the necks of tyrants to be cut than to falsify the gospel of the Son of God. There are the catechisms of your church and ours, in which the summa of doctrine is presented, testifying in no obscure manner that we accept and maintain in truth the agreement of the general church of Christ with regard to doctrine. We retain the Symbola; we restore purely the opinion of all the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures concerning repentance and faith; we have restored the right use of the Sacraments. We show what is to be kept from superstitious customs, we direct the godly again to truly good works, we show the dignity of civil offices, the difference between the law and the promises. Finally, we have brought light to many articles of Christian doctrine. The adversaries cannot deny this, and if they want to judge without slander, they will be forced to admit that we teach godly and useful things. Therefore, if they will, let them agree; if they will not, we must follow Paul's rule [Gal.1:8.f.]: "If any man teach another gospel, let him be accursed." 

The second part of our estimate is about the external things that are necessary. As these we mention the abolition of all masses, where people are missing, who are involved with the 


1) The editio princeps reads: dicit and has the marginal note: 





Aristoph. in Nub. The other editions read: discit. 2) Virg. Aen., lib. I, v. 62. 


The abolition of the canon, which commands that this ceremony be performed for others, living and dead; the abolition of any invocation of the dead, direct or indirect; the abolition of vows and monasticism; the restoration of priestly marriage and the whole sacrament; the abolition of magical customs, as the consecration of water, herbs, bells and similar things; as well as of sacrifices for the dead. 

The kings care less about doctrines than about the outward appearance of the churches. Therefore, they will fight most fiercely for the preservation of private masses, for the use of one form of the sacrament, for the invocation of the saints. Perhaps they will also quarrel about the celibacy; because it is very suitable to preserve the spiritual goods and the splendor of the priests, we can see that the bishops and the kings have a great abhorrence for the marriage of the priests. Nor will they wish to see the monastic system abolished altogether. Finally, they will present us with Mosheim's 3) or Wicel's moderations (moderationes), which retain the main aspects of the godless nature. Incidentally, they will permit that some common vices be improved, which cannot be eliminated if the roots remain. Although we do not think that they will grant us anything with respect to the mass and its observance, we can imagine that some will turn to the French advice that a mass be held daily in the parishes, even if there are no communicants. For they claim that these 


3) Rupert von Mosheim, Doctor zu Strasbourg (Bretschneider). - At the end of the fifth volume, De Wette says among the subsequent remarks: "A good-natured and, as it seems, benevolent man, Robert von Mosham (or Moshaim), cathedral dean at Passau, an ancestor of the chancellor of Mosheim, believed himself called by higher revelations to lead the apostates back into the fold of the church, and at the end (154t) wandered through the Protestant cities of the Confederation. He accused most Christians of believing much less in Christ than in Luther, the Pope or Zwingli, and was therefore considered a fraud by both Catholics and Protestants. He wanted to found his own sect, but died in 1543" (Miller's Memorabilia from the History of the Reformation, vol. 2, p. 219. Hottingeri hist. eccl., IX, 322.).

Ceremony is a work and a spectacle by which thanks are given, by which the memory of the death of Christ is preserved. It can therefore be performed by an individual, they say, just as individuals, either for the sake of remembrance or to give thanks, can read the history of Christ's death, or any psalm, for the same reason. This is brought forward with great pretense by worldly men, who are well equipped with science and eloquence, and they compare these customs with the Roman or Attic plays, which are instituted for the sake of memory. For we see that good minds incline to evil opinions. But we have decided that we will not accept a mass (/iturgiam) without communicants, because no one is allowed to establish services without the command of God. Such a spectacle, however, would be considered a necessary service of the Church, and one that must be distinguished from the meal of the people; therefore, this is not to be accepted at all. Under this assumed form, they would bring up again all the abuses of the Lord's Supper, for it would immediately be said that this spectacle of the service was ex opere operato. 1) And the example of the Levitical ceremonies need not be drawn here. These were a discipline (p¢aedagogia) for the people, and had to be held for that sake, not as a service of God. But in the New Testament, no ceremonies are acceptable without faith. The use of this ceremony is to be free, as Paul says [1 Cor. 11, 28.]: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread." And it shall remain the form of administration (ministerii) instituted by Christ and observed for quite a few centuries in the early Church. Nor can _ the adversaries complain that we depart from the church when we will not accept that spectacle. Rather, they depart from the true and ancient church by adopting a manner that was unknown to the ancient church. They will 


1) That is, it pleases God, in itself, by being accomplished. Cf. St. Louis Edition, Vol. XIX, 944. 





We also demand that we approve the use of the One Part of the Sacrament, but we cannot agree to this, because we are not allowed to deny the institution of Christ. We have learned that they are very unwilling to be called idolaters because of the invocation of the dead. Therefore, they will look for a new pretext; they will say that it is permissible to speak: Pray for us, Saint Peter. But we will not accept this form either, because every invocation of an absent one attributes omnipotence to him. Finally, we believe that they will devise all sorts of deceptions in order to excuse and maintain the root of the ungodly nature, and, like Proteus, will be whimsical in all things. But we have absolutely decided that we will not admit anything to the adversaries even of these outward things which we have enumerated. To this we also add that we will never approve of the power of the Roman Pontiff, which he assumes over the other bishops. If he may want to grant us barbarians, as he calls us, something, he will forbid the same in other realms, will order that the godly be killed, and will not cease to be the Antichrist, as Paul indicates. Therefore, his tyranny must not be strengthened. 

The third part of the deliberation is about the means, as there are some godly lessons in the churches, clothing and similar things; likewise about the reputation of the bishops, the jurisdiction and the ordination. Nothing can be done about these things if there is no prior agreement about the doctrine and the necessary things. If the bishops will stubbornly hold on to the errors and ungodly ceremonies, then we must obey Paul's rule: "If anyone teaches a different gospel, let him be accursed. They would not edify our churches either, but rather lay them waste. But if there were bishops who, like Rahab, feared the judgment of God, and wanted to look at the poor churches and the fatherland, accept the gospel for the sake of the glory of Christ, and rightly conduct their ministry: with them it would be easy to come to an agreement about the middle things, just as now we too have to deal with the inequalities in 


2432

2433 





neutral customs everywhere, as long as there is no ungodliness and the purity of the doctrine is preserved. 

You remember the history of Attalus of Pergamus. When a certain Alcibiades, out of a thoughtless desire for piety, prescribed for himself a new, exceedingly hard way of life, and ate daily only bread and salt and drank very little water, the martyr Attalus was sent by God to the prison, and he was commanded to tell Alcibiades that he should eat of the common food. And as a reason was added: so that he would not be an offense to the brethren, that is, so that others who were more rude would not admire this new and apparent way and think that such works were worship, and forget the doctrine of proper worship. 

Therefore, we also praise those who, even in matters of means, do away with inconsistent customs, as fasts, which cause some error to the inexperienced. But nevertheless the whole form of the church system will have to be discussed among the godly when some [bishops] will accept the gospel. For also the form of ordination must be improved, and the canons of digamy must be amended, and the papal laws on divorces must be freed from their errors. Of course, the laws cannot be of [eternal] duration which are not given by God. Those people will also have to be admonished that they remove from the churches ceremonies that are unseemly for Christian seriousness, such as the carrying around of images and other similar things. We do not want to follow pagan but apostolic examples and love the ceremonies handed down by God, whose summa is seriousness and benefit. Godly and _ instructive sermons shall resound in the churches. The people shall have hymns from which they can learn; there shall be earnest prayers; the Lord's Supper (Synaxis) shall be celebrated as often as godly people desire the sacrament. But private absolution should precede it, which is to be maintained and restored for many reasons. Also the excommunication shall be restored, not, as before, in 








We do not judge them for their disputes over worldly matters, but for their openly disgraceful deeds, in that in every church the elders are summoned to this judgment. These are serious and necessary ceremonies to establish discipline; we cannot yet deal with the adversaries, to whom we cannot grant any authority in the church as long as they oppose the gospel. 

There you have the summa of our opinion, in which we will not change anything, God willing. Nor are we afraid of the worldly judgments of those people who cry out that the stubbornness of a few will ignite a civil war; they cry out with a loud voice: mau must give way a little for the sake of public tranquility; it is better to have only some churches than none at all; we must prefer unity to these disputes so that the war against the Turks can be undertaken. Yes, we know that many things are brought together by the wise to reproach us. Nor are we so devoid of common sense that we alone should not see our own and the common dangers. But we must obey the commandment of God, which demands the confession of right doctrine, and that ungodly worship be punished, and wills that we command it to go forth. However, although we do not doubt that you will, as before, unite your opinion with that of our church, we ask you again and again to make your will known to us, and we hope that your church will follow your decision, although we know that there are certain other people there who are oligarchs, who, like the church, are not well-disposed (aequi) to the aristocracy of the very beautiful city, who, seeking with a new and immoderate zeal to gain the favor of the enemies of the Gospel, who should curse them for their murderous deeds, indicate sufficiently that they would also gladly destroy you if they could. How much more honorable it would be for them to join in the fight for the gospel than to strengthen in the adversaries the hatred against the right doctrine and the hope for the apostasy of others! 

Therefore, we do not write anything to those oligarchically minded people, but only consult with you and ask you to give us your opinion.

We see that as the world grows old, godlessness and Epicurean opinions increase. With all the greater struggle all godly people should protect the right honors of God, not only the teachers of the churches, but also others who preside over the communities, who should also use their power for the honor of Christ. The adversaries have always done this cunningly, and if they propose any moderation, they seem to do it mainly to divide ours, knowing very well the speech of Antigonus about Eumenes, in which he told this fable: A certain lion, who loved a girl, the daughter of a shepherd, desired that she be given to him as a wife; he tells his love, and promises that for this reason no danger will threaten her, but that she will live safely and pleasantly with him.

To the highly famous men, D. Justus Jonas, Pomeranus, Philippus, the faithful messengers of Christ, his superiors in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | am writing the second letter, dear men, and if | did not hope that your letters would fly to me on the journey, | would be angry at your silence, which has lasted so long, since it seems to me 1) that you have been there so many days that you could easily return. 

For a great rumor has arisen that the meeting has been revoked, and some were expecting your return two days ago. 

Here, praise God, all is well, only your little daughter, Philip, threatened one day with illness. | write this so that you will not be worried.

Reply to No. 2629. Link, Dominicus Schleupner, Andreas Osiander, Veit Dietrich and Thomas Venatorius announce their complete agreement with what the Wittenbergers wrote to them: "Your diligent concern in these matters is so similar to ours and completely in accordance with it that we, when we read your writing about the future settlement, let ourselves think that we had written it ourselves, and you have even met and painted all our thoughts and what we ourselves have thought and considered in this, as if they were our own writings.

The old prince cannot do anything; the younger ones do not dare yet, nor could they, even if they dared. May God Himself rule His churches alone, until He finds means-tools through which He visibly rules the church for us. Amen.

Your little daughter is well and the whole Hans, which | hope you will see from his letters. May the Lord rule you by his certain, joyful Holy Spirit in his cause, and his cause in you, amen. 

Here the people rejoice that Kolax or Kohlhufen is caught with two; but | believe that you already know this, since the riders fly to you like this, and no doubt tell everything in the most reliable way. That enterprising Kolax, who has loaded himself with so many blood debts (for | would care little 3) about robbery) for one says, that more than 40 of his comrades had perished. Our castle owner says that 14 were executed, all of them from the number of those who plundered the Marzan. This is something those wicked murderers would not have believed would happen in such a short time if someone had predicted it to them that night. | will tell a ridiculous prank (stratagema) that M. Anton [Lauterbach] from Pirna writes to me. 4) Namely, that Mezentius, as he was returning through Silesia, had spent the night near Bauzen, then in a certain town of Kalau, and as he had come there late to spend the night, some noblemen came along, who said that they were looking for Hans Spregel 5) and stayed there for the night, because they had agreed that they would meet there that night.

To the excellent man, Hieronymus Weller, Doctor of Theology, his brother who is exceedingly dear to the Lord. 

Mercy and peace! What you desire, my dear Jerome, | do, and so | write to your senate. But what you write about the priest, | have read with sadness, but | ask you that you speak and write about him, as much as you can, all good, the evil that you hear, only excuse for a short time. For you do not know how strangely everything is done at the court in Dresden, about whose sullenness | am so upset.

Surely it is not the fault of the visitators if something is not done quite right (as far as | can see), but of this pack of wise people who make themselves believe that they have not ten Solomons but a hundred gods in their heads. With how deep a hatred | tend to hate this kind of people, you know that, 2) and you cannot love them either, | know that. Therefore, if those poor visitators miss something, | pray that you and yours will postpone your judgment until the day of inspection comes, which will be shortly.

He asks Luther to intercede with the Elector that the sequestered goods of the monastery at Grimma be used to pay an allowance for the low salaries of the church and school servants. - The letter is dated from Wittenberg, because Luther was absent at the time of Schreiner's personal presence there.

The Landgrave thanks Luther and Melanchthon for their opinion (concerning the bigamy), expresses the hope that he will now be able to "pursue all evangelical affairs more freely, more confidently and more courageously", while otherwise he would have fallen into despair, since he had not gone to the sacrament since the Peasants' War due to complaints of conscience.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! After the highborn Prince, Mr. Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, our kind and dear cousin, brother, and we are now all here in Schmalkalden, we are told that his dear one sent a messenger to you yesterday before the date, and perhaps wrote to you about the matters in which you and several others have previously advised his lordship, and which his lordship has now brought into execution. Since all sorts of things will happen as a result of this, we are concerned that S. L. might want to further secretly enable and induce you in his existing opinion that 





the House of Saxony, for the sake of the hereditary brotherhood and otherwise, may not be convenient: our gracious request is that you do not reply against S. L. with a final answer, where S. L.'s letter seeks such or what he would like to learn. 1) this time, but to write down your answer freshly, 2) until the other of our theologians returns to Wittenberg, then we want to talk about it with those who trust such things before, but in all cases you want to trust us and send copies of S. L.'s letter, where he will send a report, or make a report of it. Hereby you do our pleasing opinion, and are inclined to you with but graces and kindnesses.

The question of how to reply to the said Magister Eisleben, and [that] for the sake of the homeward journey (heymfort) 1) of our superiority on account of the young lord, Count Albrechten von Mansfeld, might be protracted, is a concern of many honorable, good- hearted people, whether E. A. W. such ingratitude, disgraceful word is also knowingly or concealed. Therefore, | have decided in the best way and considered it good to inform E. A. W. of his complaint and letter before anything else, which | do herewith, considering that E. A. W.'s letter against the Antinomians 2) (Antiqmtinche) was first dedicated to me, from which the wounds were partly hewn and the horse was running and the bear was humming, so that E. A. W. may first have knowledge of such a violent and poisonous letter, [and] the reason. We want to respond to this pestilence and poisonous worm with salutary theriac (Tiriack), if necessary and in all fairness, through Christ, our Lord and Savior. To E. A. W. now and [with] all yours be eternally commanded. Dated Eisleben, April 7, 1540. E. A. Wirden unterthaniger pupil Caspar Guethel.

(as addressed to Jonas, Bugenhagen and Cruciger with, from the Wetstein collection in Amsterdam); in De Wette, vol. V, p. 275 f. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1300. 


To the highly famous man, Magister Philipp Melanchthon, the faithful disciple of Christ, his exceedingly dear brother. 

Grace and peace! That you write, my dear Philip, that the emperor promises a private conversation, | also wonder very much about what that means. | believe that the emperor is uncertain what he wants to do. 


1) "Going home" == leading home, wedding. 2) St. Louis edition, vol. XX, 1648. 


He should take care of all things. It is necessary for him to have a hidden heart, since he is caught among so many vipers that he can do neither us nor them enough by making certain promises. For | think what | should do if | were caught in his place, especially since | am not at all knowledgeable about things. God must be asked for him. It is indeed no small miracle of God that he has held back the Emperor's hand for so many years, while the Cardinals and Bishops raged in vain, inciting, urging and driving him; it is incumbent upon us to thank God for this. But whatever happens, happens or happens, we will accomplish everything through prayer, which alone is the almighty ruler in human affairs; Through it we will direct what has been decided, correct errors, bear what cannot be corrected, overcome all evils, preserve all that is good, as we have done until now, and we have experienced the power of prayer, of which the papists know nothing, the obdurate people who have become disgraced in so many counsels; they will not and cannot repent. And the final wrath of God comes upon them, who have filled their hands with the blood of Christ and the Christians; yes, they have long since been completely drowned in the blood of the saints, as it were. For though we wretched sinners live in the sinful flesh, yet we are pure of blood, yea, we hate the bloodthirsty and the blood god that possesses and drives them. This | have written only to answer, and to testify that | have received your letters; 3) for such things we are wont to communicate with one another. 


3) Here, Schiitze, Aurifaber, Wetstein and Cod. Goth. The following with deviations: Everything stands well here. We pray and certainly believe that we will be heard. Although it is still uncertain, we also believe about our understanding or request. We will nevertheless attain what we have prayed for, as we have attained it so far. It is God who gives life in the midst of death, and has mercy in the midst of anger, and laughs in the midst of wrath, so He will give the fulfillment of petitions in the midst of rejecting them. All his works are divine and marvelous and incomprehensible: for him there is that which is not; there is that which perishes; there stands that which falls, and for him nothingness is everything; to him alone be the glory, who alone is God; he alone makes everything, he alone governs everything. Whether you bring us peace, we will receive it as brought from the midst of war; whether you bring us peace, we will receive it as brought from the midst of war; whether you bring us peace, we will receive it as brought from the midst of war; whether you bring us peace, we will receive peace.

He crucified him who was crucified by him, the triumphant one in Israel, and he put him on display, and gave him up to us to be laughed at, to be mocked, if we believe in the crucifier, the Lord Jehovah Christ, and the crucifier of his crucifier, the devil. For even if he crucifies us, we too will crucify him again with the very thing with which he will crucify us, and on that day, or even before, we will make a public spectacle of him.

The original is in the Dessau State Archives. Printed by De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 259. 


To the most illustrious and highborn Prince and Lord, Lord Joachim of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien and Lord of Bernburg, his gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Sublime prince, highborn count! M. Georg Aemilius, my compatriot, has published poems about the prophetic images (figuras) of the Revelation and has attributed them to the name E. F. G.. Since he had decided to deliver them himself personally, he asked me to recommend him by my letter and to prepare for him an easier access to E. F. G.. Although | knew that my recommendation was not at all necessary, since his own erudition recommends him sufficiently, and he, with the kindness and accessibility of E. F. G., would have easily found admission without my letter [, | did not want to refuse]. 1) However, he not only had this in mind, that he was looking for a patron for his book, but that he would also like to stimulate other princes through the example of E. F. G. to love and cultivate the sciences and to support the students. This endeavor shines out almost alone in your Anhaltian family, which all good and learned men admire highly and wish luck to it. Therefore, may E. F. G., whatever the offered gift may be, receive it with the usual grace. | heartily commend E. F. G. to the goodness of GOD, the merciful Father, with all her house, Amen.

Grace and peace! | have received your letter, my dear Caspar, together with the abuses of M. Eisleben. But what else can | do but let the judgment of God fall upon him who has despised the mercy of God? If he does not suffer Luther as a friend, he may suffer him as an enemy, although | do so unwillingly. "I think that the little fool has become nonsensical. But | ask you again to gather testimonies about his teachings, because | did not believe them before when you sent them to me, and so | lost them.

Since in these letters it was requested that the appointment of Mr. Johann Fischer be confirmed by public ordination, we have recognized, after examination of his scholarship, that he holds the pure and general (Catholicam) doctrine of the Gospel, which our church also teaches and confesses, and has an abhorrence of all fanatical opinions, which are condemned by the judgment of the general church of Christ. He also promised that he would faithfully present to the people the pure doctrine that we profess. Therefore, since our ministry must not be lacking to the neighboring churches, and the Concilium at Nicaea has decided in a godly manner that ordination should be desired by the neighboring churches, we have commanded this Mr. Johann Fischer by public ordination the office of teaching the Gospel in the church and administering the sacraments instituted in the Gospel, according to his calling. Therefore we commend him to the church of the city of Rudelstadt, and ask that the Holy Spirit may govern the ministry of this Mr. Johann Fischer for the glory of God and our Lord JEsu Christ, and for the salvation of the church.

Since Magister Georgius Aemilius is called upon to train your youth and to lead them in the arts and breeding, | kindly ask you to let the same M. Gérgen be faithfully ordered to you; for he is a very fine, learned fellow, and has also shown himself to be quiet and calm with us, so that, where you will also do to tame the wild youth for the good example of others, he can produce great fruit.

G. and F. in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Magister Georg Scharf, to whom E. C. F. G. of the fiefdom of Wartberg, has turned away and become a preacher at Herzberg, has united with the preacher there that he should take his place at Wittenberg, for reasons of which he is aware, and the said preacher, George Schnell, has granted him his merit and everything (which is better than this), for the sake that he, a single person, would like to study here, and has asked me to write to E. C. F. G. and to ask that E. C. F. G. would graciously grant such a fief to the above-mentioned Georgen Schnell. He is a very pious, hard-working man, in addition to that he is of service, and studies quickly especially in the Ebraischen, is a good preacher that those in Herzberg are very reluctant to leave him. Therefore, | humbly ask E. C. F. G. to have such a fief prescribed for him, where there would be no other concern, in which E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously show themselves.

Oh, what a great pain it would have been if | had learned that you, too, Laug, had left Erfurt. Laug, had been lured away from Erfurt to Henry's duchy.

Wittenberg. May 17, 1540. Ordination certificate for Heinrich Bock. 


From the original signed by Luther and his colleagues, which is kept in the Nicolai Church in Reval (where Bock's tomb is still located), in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 283 and in the Corp. 

Since the council of the city of Reval in Liefland has appointed Magister Heinrich Bock from Hameln, a man of excellent godliness and scholarship, to govern their church, he has also requested that our judgment of him be made known to him. But we desire most of all that godly, serious and learned people be placed before the churches of Christ. Therefore, we have approved this appointment with the greatest willingness, and have admonished Magister Heinrich to take upon himself the leadership of the church in Reval. Since he has lived in the school of our church for more than ten years and in the meantime has led the Saxon Collegium in Erfurt with great praise, we have learned that he is of honorable and godly manners and has diligently exempted the church doctrine. However, he holds the unanimous doctrine of the general church of Christ, which our church also confesses, and abhors all fanatical opinions, which are condemned by the judgment of the general church of Christ. Furthermore, the knowledge of the arts, which includes philosophy, is of some service in teaching. Since Magister Heinrich has applied good diligence to all parts of philosophy, he wisely and correctly distinguishes ecclesiastical doctrine from philosophy, and applies the right manner and skill in explaining it, which is worthy of a learned man. He has also promised that he will constantly and diligently present to the people the pure doctrine of the Evangelist which our church confesses. Therefore, so that there would be a public testimony of our judgment, we have commanded him in the church the office of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments instituted by Christ, according to his calling. We testify to this by this public letter, and commend him to the church at Reval, and ask that it lovingly receive him, nurture and care for him, and protect him. The greatest good deed of God on earth is the public office of the

God wants it to shine in the cities and in the society of the people. Therefore, the cities do an extremely pleasant service to God, which order the churches properly and provide and protect godly and well- instructed teachers. We therefore exhort the city of Reval to keep this very good and extremely learned man, Magister Heinrich, in a godly manner, and to support and protect him in such a great government.

Since, however, the need still exists to provide the people of Zeitz with a learned, understanding, God-fearing man, who leads a good and honorable life and walk, according to the opportunity and form of the place, and they therefore ask so highly for the said Magister Eberhard, as can be seen from their writing, their chur- and F.

G., otherwise a great, rich lord, can gain nothing with good people's poverty, but rather they would like to invite God's disgrace upon themselves, with whom it is very small to make rich poor and poor rich. | do not ask for justice (of which | know nothing, nor do | want to know), but for mercy and favor; for our Lord will also need God's mercy and favor, as our Lord knows better than to report this himself. For if we seek our right too strictly against our neighbor, and do not also let grace shine, then God will also seek His right against us, and leave grace dark. | hope that Your Lordship will understand nothing else from this than that | love Your Lordship as my dear sovereign, and that | mean him with heartfelt loyalty, which is why | cannot bear to hear anything unkind said by Your Lordship; much less can my conscience suffer that | should be worried as if God were angry with Your Lordship, and

No. 2667. 


(Wittenberg.) Late May or early June 1540. 


To a council of the Landgrave of Hesse. 


Luther insists on non-disclosure of the confessional secret. 


The original draft by Luther's own hand is in the secret archives at Weimar, Reg. P. 163, No. 19, p. 116. Printed by De Wette-Seidemann, Vol. VI, p. 262. 


G. u. F. My dear Lord and friend! That | am not writing to M. G. H., the Landgrave, but to you at your request, has its reasons. For | am well plagued with this matter from high and lowly estates, that | must remain on my "No".1) For what is a secret yes cannot become a public yes, otherwise secret and public would be one and the same, without distinction, which neither should nor can be. Therefore the secret yes must remain a public "no", and again. All for the reason: Unius testimonium 


1) Here follow the words crossed out by Luther: "und nichts mit dem Landgrafen zu thun haben". 





(that is, "secretly") Nu/lum, Duorum autem (that is, publicly") omnia. Sicut ergo nullum et omne, sic differunt secretly and publicly. [Deut. 19,15.) On this | have so far remained, and still, say that the landgrave's other marriage is nothing, and no one can convince it. For as they say it, namely 2) palam, it is nothing true, although it is true as they should not say, namely 2) clam. 

But in this the landgrave is too close to us, yes, much more to himself, that he wants to make it palam (public), which we have made clam [secret] with him, and make an omne (everything) out of a nullum (nothing), which we neither know how to defend nor to answer for. 3) My Gen. 16, 4) would also not help him, because | have taught many ways before and after that one should not bring up Moses' laws, whether one would use them as an example in secret or publicly by order of the authorities, which would give the choice. Accordingly, if | were to advise a poor conscience in secret need of confession to use Moses’ laws or examples, | would not, indeed could not, have established a public right or a reasonable example, because | would be a confessor to whom nothing is publicly available as a right or an example, but would have to act solely on the secret need of the conscience. 5) | would be a confessor to whom nothing is publicly available as a right or an example. 

6) But it does not have to be a public law nor an example, although it was 7) left to the dear fathers in the Law of Moses in the past. Regardless of the fact that one can find in the histories after the birth of Christ several examples where a man secretly had to have two wives because of the need of his conscience, or because of the superiority of the wilderness. 


2) "namely" put by us instead of: ".,." which stands for: ".i. == id est 

3) Here follow the words which Luther again deleted: "and would thereby come to each other". 

4) See St. Louis edition, Vol. Ill, 275, Z 6 and especially § 10. 

5) Here follow the crossed out words: "no superiority but". 

6) Here the deleted words precede: "Accordingly, your council pleases me very well that the landgrave lets a ban go out." 

7) First Luther wrote, but crossed out again: "But this piece must be drawn into it, that it could not be a public right or example, without the authority to do what".

leu, as some say of the emperor Carolo Magno and Valentiniano. But out of all this no right, example, or custom can be made public.1) For it is not true: What you do out of necessity, | may do out of right. A thief steals bread in hunger, and is not punished. A necessity is a murder, but is not condemned. But this does not make it a right or an example to steal and murder freely. Necessity transcends right and example, and yet does not make right and example. Necessitas frangit legem, sed non facit legem. 

But this sharp disputation will nevertheless leave the pen in the heart, as if the landgrave had two wives in public, and wanted to decorate it with words and make it secret, and will hardly put an end to the disputing. Therefore, | want (if it is possible) that the landgrave reverts to the secret "yes" and the public "no", and let evil speak and preach that by right or example no one could help himself to have more than one wife, silent, however, of the secret advice and need, done in confession, or in the future. But | want to leave the announcement pending. For since there has been no announcement that one may have two wives, but only is still in the clamor (in addition, about one person, the landgrave), so one would let clamor go against clamor, then the negativa sermon would easily silence the affirmativum clamor with time, because a public sermon is more capable than a hundred tabernacle clamors and alley tales. 

Such seems to me to be the easiest way. And that the landgrave (as he is guilty of) meanwhile also kept such a thing secret, and yet did not leave the mead, because he took it upon himself so dearly that it was necessary for him. So we, theologians or confessors, could help to defend it before God as a matter of necessity, which had to be mended with most examples. But that we should defend it before the world and now rain, this we cannot and will not do. Otherwise, nothing shall be spared in our service in this matter. 


1) Here follow the crossed out words: "because the public rights find now at this time against it and condemn such, with which one should and must hold firmly". 





No. 2668. 


(Wittenberg.) Early June 1540. 


To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


After the landgrave himself has made the confession clear, Luther indicates to the Elector how he came to give this advice. He still upholds it. 


A copy of the original is in the Kiel University Library, K. B. 85, p. 7. Printed by Seidemann, "Lauterbachs Tagebuch" 2c., p. 196 ff. In the determination of the time, we have followed Kolde, who Analecta p. 348 has a Regest brings. Seidemann places this letter in "April or June", but the complaint by the Dresdeners mentioned in it necessitates the later date (before June 10). 

Most illustrious, highborn Lord, most gracious Lord! | have heard that E. churf. G. is being unreasonably complained about in the Landgrave's matters from the court at Dresen, and E. churf. G. will certainly allow himself to be heard against such clever meiBners. For what the matter is, we both, | and M. Philipps, did not want to report to E. churf. G. (as a matter of confession) ourselves, as it is proper in matters of confession to keep secret, both the matter and the confessor; and if the landgrave had not disclosed this matter of confession and confessor, there would be nothing of such displeasure and spitting. 

And still say now: 

If such a thing were to happen to me this very day, | would not know how to advise otherwise than as | have advised. This did not cause me any concern (where it would be revealed afterwards), regardless of whether | am not as wise as they might think, for this is how the matter stood at that time: Martinus Bucerus brought a credence 2) and indicated how the landgrave did not know how to keep himself chaste due to some defects in his husband, had also lived in such and such a way up to now, which is not good, and should be evangelical, in addition to being one of the most distinguished heads. Accordingly, he took it upon himself and trusted in God and in his conscience that he would not be able to avoid such vices from now on, when he would not be allowed to take another wife. We, however, were almost frightened by such a narration because of the desolate astonishment that would follow, and

We asked that H.F.G. would not do it; then we were further told that he could not let it be done; if we would not let it be done, he still wanted to do it, unseen by us, and obtain it from the emperor or the pope. We, however, humbly asked him to do so, if he wanted to do so, or (as he said) if he did not know how to do so in conscience and before God, that he would keep it secret, because such necessity would force him to do so, since it could not be defended against the world and the empire's rights. Which is therefore promised to us. Accordingly, we wanted to cover it up as much as possible before God with examples, such as Abraham 2c. All this was done and acted in confession, so that we cannot be blamed as if we had done it willingly and gladly or with pleasure and joy. It was hard enough for us, but because we could not prevent it, we thought to save our conscience as much as we could. 

| have probably received more things, both under the priesthood and afterwards, in confession and given advice, which, if they were to be revealed, | would have to say no to them, or report the confession as well. Such things do not belong to the secular court, nor to be revealed. God has His own court here, and must advise the soul, since neither law nor art can help in the eyes of the world. My preceptor in the monastery, a fine old man, also had many such things, and once had to say with a sigh: "Alas, alas! such things are so erroneous and desperate that no wisdom, law or reason can advise here, one must command them divinae_ bonitati. From such experience | have also acted in this according to divine goodness. 

But if | had known that the landgrave had long since atoned for such necessity and could atone for it in other ways than | am now learning, in the one at Eschweg, no angel would have brought me to such advice. | considered the unavoidable need and weakness, also the perilousness of his conscience, which M. Bucerus presented, much less would | have advised that it should be a public wedding, in addition (which was also completely concealed) a Principissa and young Landgravine should come along, which of course was not to be. 


| understood and hoped that, because of the weakness of the flesh, he would have to use his common nature for sins and disgraces, and that he would secretly keep an honest maiden in a house in secret marriage (although it would have an illegitimate reputation in the eyes of the world) for his great need of conscience, as has happened several times with great lords, just as | gave such advice to some parish priests under Duke George and the bishops that they should secretly marry their cooks. 

This is the confessional speech, which | would much rather conceal, if it did not force out the necessity; now | cannot do it. But the fact that they are dressed as if | had taught them such things thirteen years ago shows them how kind they are to us and how much they want to love and unite, just as if there were neither trouble nor infirmity among them, which are ten times heavier before God, nor is this our advice, without the world having to spit from the splinters of its neighbor with confidence and forget the beams in its eyes. If | were to defend everything now that | said or did years ago, especially in the beginning, | would have to worship the pope; should they also defend their former nature (I will remain silent about the present one), they would belong to the devil more than to God. 

| am not ashamed of such a report, wherever it should come before the whole world, without preferring to keep it quiet for the sake of displeasure (where it would be possible).

To the highly esteemed man, Mr. M. Anton Lauterbach, pastor in Pirna, his extremely dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! About the new marriage of the landgrave, which you desire, | can write nothing, my dear Anton. | have heard that a baby has been born from the virgin of Sala 1). Whether it is true, | do not know. And if it were true, and he acknowledged that he was the father and fed mother and child, he would seem to be justified in doing so. If the rumor has arisen from this, then the rumor is not without cause. This much | know, and public testimonies of the marriage have not been shown to me. Then there are heirs from the lawful wife, who do not allow (not even the great ones) that co-heirs come from another woman, especially from a lesser blood. Therefore let them bark that bark, until the thing itself teaches what a monstrosity this is. About princes and the affairs of princes one must not judge presumptuously without knowing the matter. About other things by your ordinand. Wittenberg, given 1540, the second of

2472 No. 2872. 9 June 1540. Landgrave Philip of Hesse to Luther and Melanchthon. 


The Landgrave regrets that his second marriage has become known against his will and without his consent, and reports that Duke Heinrich of Saxony has had the wife of Sala picked up by guards. Now he asks Luthern to intercede for her with Duke Heinrich, to make the whole matter clear to him, and also to report the facts to the preachers in Dresden. 


A copy signed by the landgrave himself is in the state archives at Marburg. Printed by Kolde, p. 349. 

Our gracious greetings beforehand. Worthy and highly learned, dear faithful! You, Doctor Luther, have undoubtedly recently been sufficiently informed by Philippum Melanthonem, what form we performed the digamiam with a respectable woman of the nobility's daughter. 1) Now we would have liked to keep the same dispensation in good secrecy, according to your and the other scholars’ concerns, as nothing has changed in us in this case. 

We also kept it so secret that we did not like to let the taken person see out of a window. For ever our opinion was and still is to keep such dispensation as much as possible secret, so that it would not give birth to an introduction that everyone should or wanted to follow. However, that such a thing may have become known through undisclosed people, whom this trade trusts, and especially also our sister, 2) who has no reason for the writing, nor knows how it stands around a troubled conscience, does not do us any favors. 

And therefore we do not want to deprive you of our good faith, although we have confidentially informed our dear cousin, Duke Moritz of Saxony, who has been with us for a few days, of this trade, after his beloved had already understood something about it, 3) and the surplus (because we, since his beloved had to know something about this trade, could not avoid discovering the same to his beloved), also his beloved. 


1) The wedding was not on March 4, as Késtlin and Kolde state; others place it correctly on March 3, so also Seckendorf, Hist. Luth. lib. Ill, p. 278 b, who reports that it took place on Wednesday after Oculi (that is March 3). Oculi fell on February 29. 

2) The Duchess Elisabeth of Rochlitz, the daughter-in-law of George of Saxony. With her, the landgrave had met Margaretha von der Sala, her lady-in-waiting. 

3) Added by us. 


Letters from the year 1540. No. 2672. 





2473 


We have been friendly and well pleased with us, but it seems to us that his beloved father, Duke Henry of Saxony, should have sent for the woman in question as soon as she had returned from our country to her house, and had her brought with several equipped horses, and written to her as if he had to speak to her. Since the woman had not been able to give us her daughter unless we had promised her that it was permissible with God in the form of a dispensation, and we had therefore let her see your writings and those of other scholars, 5) as well as our wife's permission, 6) on the other hand, we had put her off, if she should encounter anything about our wanting to place our body and goods with her. Now, if something troublesome were to happen to the women, it would be very bad for her, and we would not be able to avoid taking care of her, and, as far as our ability goes, we would have to take care of her. 

Therefore, since Duke Henry is related to the Gospel, and you will undoubtedly be held in good esteem and hearing by him, we indicate to you that, in order to prevent further harm, inasmuch as we wish to remind you of this in a Christian and well-meaning manner, and trust you with all the best, you should send the aforementioned Duke Henry a skillful letter, how you know what to do, and let it go out in the most favorable way, or send a trusted person, by which you report what form would be dispensed with us, and that it should also, as far as possible, be kept secret and used in such a way that it should not give birth to a consequence or common introduction that everyone wants to follow 2c., and that the same report should also be made to the prelates in Dresden (Tresen), as you will know how to write it more skilfully than you have now told, and especially add: because this dispensation would have the form that he [Duke Henry] would therefore, for the sake of peace and for the good of all things, let the much- touched wife move back into her house without charge and therefore not burden or harass her any further. 

In this you are undoubtedly doing a good work conducive to peace, which we again want to blame on you, to whom we are well inclined, in all goodness, and have not been able to save you in this way.

Grace and peace. "Dear master magistrate! Tell the journeyman to keep the maid for marriage, because the matter has come too far, as your letter reports, that there is" the consent and knowledge of the mother and the girl, "desired by him"; item, "that she is deceiving others for his sake". In this he would do her irreparable harm, about which he would have a constant and unrelievable conscience, which (because it is the wrath of God) would be hard to bear afterwards, namely for him, who would not yet have experienced temptations, and after this is left, no calm marriage could be entered into either. My lady greets you, and we pray for your wife's salvation through Christ and in Christ and to Christ, amen. On the Saturday after Barnabas [June 12] 1540.

By the Grace of God John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c. Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! Although we intend to send the also reverend, our dear faithful, Magister Philips Melanchthon, along with other of our scholars, to Hagenau, it is happening with him in such a way that we fear he will not come there this time because of his weakness, and first of all so soon. Since the also highly esteemed, our councilor and dear faithful, Gregorius Brick, Doctor, has reported to us what the aforementioned Magister Philippi wrote to Hagenau on account of his tire: so we consider, for your excited and other more reasons, that there should be no hurry with his journey. But since necessity demands that we have you at hand the next day, and that we send one or two theologians immediately to Hagenau, we graciously request that you rise up in Wittenberg, and, since it is your opportunity, to dispose of it ina manner conducive to us here in Weimar. And because it has the opportunity with Mag. Philippsen, then Doctor Caspar Creutzigern wants to bring you here, also graciously request this to him by virtue of this order of ours and indicate that he wants to consider his things according to whether we would order him herefrom further against Hagenau, so that he can be used for this, as we are sure that he will not complain. 


We did not want to leave this undisclosed to you, and do this to us as a gracious and good favor. Date at Weimar, Wednesday after Viti and Modesti [June 16] Anno Domini 1540.

| wish that this will be certain, that the journey will be uncertain, amen. A few days ago | wrote to D. Brick how sorry we are that we did not talk about your journey earlier, since the Hessian (Macedonicum) trade did not let us realize how dangerous it would be for you to send sheep in the midst of the wolves, especially since the memory of it finally scourged us, that you have so severely injured and provoked against your head those most /upissimos and cruel 1) wolves and satans, 2) that now, just the other way around (vice versa), they will begin to think or suspect that you are hostile to them, but | am more favorably disposed. Therefore, your danger will be twice as dangerous as mine, since you now appear to have deliberately deceived them, which you know, and we know, is quite wrong. But Satan is the interpreter there, that is, a slanderer, and a devil worthy of his name (diabolus ==  slanderer). Therefore, you will take care that you are not sent there, if only for the sake of your weakness. But if you have to go, because God resists our wishes, our Father will still be with you. It is extraordinary how much we desire to see you, and God, who does wonderful things always and everywhere, does not despise our requests. Send thou all, that thou mayest be trustworthy and bold. We are with you, and you with us, and Christ is here and there with us. Fear not; we shall prevail, and we shall live, though we be sinners. "He is the Advocate with the Father," says John [1 Ep. 2:1], "in our stead and for us. 

| would like you not to grieve too much over the Hessian (Macedonian) deal, after the matter has come to the point that it can neither be advised by mourning nor by cheerfulness. Therefore, why do we kill ourselves in vain or hinder the knowledge of the victor over all death and sorrow through sadness? For he who overcame the devil and judged the prince of this world, does he not also 


1) Instead of suavissimos we have assumed saevissimos. 2) by the writings mentioned in No. 2677. 





With him, will this trouble be judged and overcome? For even if this present trouble ceases, he will afterwards cause other and perhaps greater troubles, which we, if we live, will nevertheless overcome and also laugh at through the same victor. There is nothing of calamity, not even hell, of which He did not say and want to be understood [John 16:33]: "| have overcome the world, be of good cheer!" Then, if the emperor and the empire wanted, as they will finally be forced to want, they could easily counter this offense either by a renewed edict or by a newly decreed edict that this deed should not be allowed to become either a right or an example. You know that in this case it was presented as if it were a case of extreme necessity, which either suffers no law, or at least mitigates it. Therefore, | beg you for the sake of Christ, be of good and calm mind, and let those whose cause it is do something, and bear their burden, and not burden us alone. Since they know that we are sincere and faithful, they cannot accuse us of any offense, except for mercy or the kindest compliance. And what evil is there that these princes do not commit through the emperor's compliance? although their misdeeds should not be misdeeds as long as they are hostile to us. Our virtues, however, are shameful deeds as long as we do not worship Satan with them. But let Satan have a good year! For his sake let us mourn nor be grieved; but in the Lord Christ let us rejoice and be glad; he will destroy all our enemies. We are not yet in the case of David, whose cause was much more desperate; yet he has not fallen, nor will this cause fall. Why then do you torment yourself, since the final cause (causa finalis) is certain, namely the victory of Christ, although the formal and middle cause is somewhat disfigured by this trouble. My Kathe also calls you to be strong and cheerful. We, who sincerely love you, will pray diligently and vigorously for you. Fare well in Christ and do not fear or worry.

Cast all your care on him [1 Petr. 5, 7], who wants to be concerned for us and has commanded and demands that this be believed. How | hate this stable 1) which is corrupted by devilish wisdom, you know enough; we will have more to deal with these serpents and monsters of wisdom than with all public and private enemies, just as it was with their spiritual (mystico) father, whose seed is mighty in this land. May GOD curse him, and in a short time, amen. But this shall be established, "| have overcome the world," and [John 14:19.] "Ye shall live, because | live." Again, be at ease, and be joyful and quiet, | beseech thee, as we desire, rather as the LORD hath commanded. Here, by God's grace, all is well, to whom alone be the glory.

Your Martin Luther. 


No. 2680. June 20, 1540. Landgrave Philip of Hesse to Luther and Melanchthon. (Regest.) 


Through no fault of his own, the digamy had become public knowledge. He now asks for your advice on what he should do, whether he should perhaps explain his reasons in a public announcement 2c. He expects your assistance, otherwise he would have to show your handwriting. In a special note to Luther, he asks him not to be frightened. He asked for nothing more than that they stick to their advice. 


Printed in M. Lenz, Briefwechsel, vol. |, p. 363. Above regest in Kolde, Analecta p. 353. 


No. 26081. June 23, 1540. The Hessian theologians Adam Kraft, Johannes Kymeus, Dionysius Melander, Johann Lening to Luther and Melanchthon. 


They ask, under assertion of the same reasons, which the landgrave has brought forward in the previous letter, not to leave the same, and to advise them, what is to be done now. 


From a copy in the state archives at Marburg, printed by Kolde, p. 353 


1) The "stable" (caulam) probably means the court in Dresden (cf. No. 2658), and the "spiritual father" Duke Georg. 





Grace and peace! What happened in Rotenburg 2) before the last meeting in Schmalkalden, dear fathers and teachers in Christ, you know very well. But we hoped that this matter would be concealed according to your advice, to which some of our people had subscribed. 3) We are not sure whether this is true or not. Incidentally, against the will of our prince and completely against the will of all of us, the rumor has been spread very widely, which (as is right) fills us with no small pain, since we fear that this rumor will harm the Gospel of Christ. We also hear that you will abandon our prince in this matter; 4) that you may not do so, we implore you for the sake of God's heartfelt mercy and by all that is holy. For if a separation of the allied states has been started, we fear very much that a downfall of all things, also of godliness and science, will follow. Nor does the prince wish you to defend his concubinage as a right and lawful marriage at this time, when polygamy has ceased to be in use. It will be enough if you do not regret your given advice, if you uphold it and, if the matter should require it, confess it. We are convinced that you will do this bravely and with undaunted courage. Our people have failed (we do not deny this) to publish the matter that should have been concealed and kept secret, but not less, but much more seriously (but with reservation of your judgment) we would err and sin against godliness if we left the prince, who is otherwise very good, in the lurch because of the publication of the concubinage, and gave cause for discord, which God may always avert. For who could prevent the prince, if he were abandoned in this not altogether bad matter, from entering into other relations, and being intent on such things, by which he would preserve himself and his own, as much as he could, and tear himself out of the threatening storms of war? But this is what we think of you, that since you have willingly faced much greater dangers for God, godliness and freedom before, you will not be unequal to yourselves in this matter, especially since your godly concern on the occasion of this matter 5) will not be able to be equal to yourselves. 


2) Rotembergae, Rotenburg an der Fulda. Philip's marriage to Margaretha von der Sala took place there on March 3. 3) See No. 2610. 4) This will perhaps refer to No. 2667. 5) No. 2610. 


2482 


This is a document that has induced some of our people (which they would never have done otherwise) to sign it. And truly! the way of life, which the prince now observes, is much further away from infamy than before, since he (unfortunately!) corrupted himself by illicit and indiscriminate lust pestilence (promiscua venere), and there was an occasion to blaspheme the gospel. 

We do not doubt your godliness. We know and revere your gifts. So far, you have sufficiently demonstrated the insurmountable majesty of your minds in the face of danger. Therefore, it does not require many words with you, whom we acknowledge and honor as our fathers and teachers in the Lord. We wish you the best of prosperity in the Lord Jesus for a long time. And again we adjure you by the mercy of God that you will not leave us or ours in this matter, because of the many dangers that might arise from it for the Gospel and the churches. And again, you should be convinced once and for all by our prince that, if Christ is gracious, he would rather lose his life and everything than fall away from the Gospel. We also ask your advice as to whether you consider it more useful to leave this matter doubtful as it is, or whether it seems more advisable to reveal to the most distinguished of the knighthood and the most respected of the cities both the deed itself and the causes of the deed that drove the prince to it, so that in these anxieties and distresses we do not carelessly subject ourselves to any matter that we might later regret in vain, when the ability to change and recant has been taken away. We also ask, as diligently and respectfully as we can and should, that you not be sorry for your counsel.

To the Duchess Catharina of Saxony. 


Luther repeatedly asks them (cf. No. 2565) to take up the cause of the Reformation in the Duchy of Saxony. 


Printed in the Jenaer Ausg. (1568), vol. VII, p. 392; in the Altenburger, vol. VII, p. 426; in the Leipziger, vol. XXI,p.371; inWalch,vol. XX1,438; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 296 and in the Erl. Edition, vol. 55, p. 286. 


Again, | ask in all humility that E. F. G. would help seriously and diligently, as you gave me great hope in Leipzig, that the churches and the schools, which is the highest service of God, may not be forgotten, nor be held in low esteem. For | hear and see many things that | would not have provided for myself, which truly displease me; although little is to be gained from my displeasure, if it does not displease God Himself, and in the end does not come to a good end. God grant God the courage to see and do this (as God has now given God the space and power to do it easily), so that the dear Gospel may increase in the principality, or even remain. 

For it has many and great secret enemies within, who boast of being great lovers of the word, and yet are heartily hostile to the persons who have to lead it, which is a very crude, foolish, yet damaging handle, to destroy the dear gospel by much and high boasting.

Grace and peace! Yes, you may rather expect and receive us (if God gives grace), either on the next Sunday or Monday, my dear Laug. For it is firmly decided to take supper (Coenare) at Erfurt, either on Sunday or on Monday, if God does not refuse it. At the same time we will bring the Lord Philip with us. Namely, we are traveling again straight to Hagenau, | would like to think, to see perhaps for the last time that terrible Syrian, 3) the Behemoth, 4) whom in the second Psalm he who dwells in heaven has laughed at for twenty years, more or less. But they will not understand this laughter until the lamentable end of the psalm 5) is upon them: You will perish in the way, because his wrath is unburned, because they will not kiss the Son. Auren, Amen, be it done, be it done, so they deserve it, so they want it. Farewell and pray for us.

We do not have a penny of small coin at court, as wavy as you have in Wittenberg. For Georgen Schnellen from H. Georgen Land full of WeiBensee has come the small money.

It would be good, however, if people began to avoid even the Marks, like the Scottish pennies, because they do too much damage to this principality, because one is not worth 5 pf. And "l6gen die Lange nicht gelitten werden ohn Verderben meines gten Herrn, auch seiner Lande und Leute, wie wir sagen werden, will's GOOD. You "lay try with Hans von Taubenheim in Torgau, whether he could or will change you for the Thaler small coin. Nothing new, denu that also here in these lands the devil rages with terrible examples of his wickedness, and drives people [to] murder, fire, 2) self-murder 2c. They are also quickly caught and judged, so that God may admonish us to believe, fear and pray. For it is God's punishment for the ingratitude and contempt of His dear word. Magister Philipps comes back to life from the grave, still looks sickly, but still lively, jokes and laughs with us again and eats and drinks with us over the table as before. Praise be to God, and give thanks also with us to the dear Father in heaven, who raises the dead and alone saves all the dead.

But | am worried, as | have often prophesied, that the pope might lead the Turk over us, since Ferdinand would not almost resist, as he is said to have said some strange words, and to see the work evenly. For the pope is already singing: Flectere sinequeo superos, Acheronta movebo. 3) If he cannot drive the emperor over us, he will try it with the Turk. He will not give way to Christ; so also strike Christ in three, both in Turks, pope and devil, and prove that he is the right one and only HErr, set by the Father at his right hand, amen.

Your Grace shall know that here, in praise of God, we are fresh and healthy; eat like the Behemen (but not very much); drink like the Germans (but not much), but are cheerful. For our gracious Lord of Magdeburg, Bishop Amsdorf, is our table companion. More new newspaper we do not know, because that D. Caspar, Mecum and Menius have taken good care of themselves, have gone on a walk from Hagenow to Strasbourg, Hans full of jeans for service and honor. M. Philipps has again become fine, praise God. Tell my dear D. Schiefer that his King Ferdinand wants to get a hue and cry, as if he wanted to ask the Turk to be godfather over the Protestant princes; do not hope that [it] is tue, otherwise it would be too coarse. Write me also once whether you have received everything that | sent you, as the other day 90 fl. at Wélfen Fuhrmann 1) 2c. Hiemit GOtt commanded, Amen. And let the children pray.

No. 2691. (Eisenach.) , July 19 or 20, 1540. 


Concerns of Luther and the Electoral Council about the Landgrave's double marriage, at Eisenach. 


Explaining the consequences of the publication, they advise to keep the deal secret and send various forms on how to answer any inquiries evasively. Margaretha von der Sala must also be kept completely secret, the Landgrave must get closer to the Landgravine, the relevant documents must be confiscated and, if necessary, the Court of Appeals must be recused. 


From the State Archives at Marburg printed in Kolde, Analecta, p. 360. 


Written concerns 2) of Luther and the other electoral councilors and theologians, of the Landgrafen Rathen finally delivered. 


We have read through the submitted advice of its content and noted the same on two main points. 

As far as the first, namely the secrecy 2c., is concerned, that our gracious lord, the Landgrave of Hesse, 2c., not only pleases us well, but we also advise it faithfully and ask that it be done in such a way, completely subserviently, and that his F. G. let this matter stand in terminis quaestionis facti, that is, doubtful whether it is so or not, as his F. G. is to be instructed, and that his F. G. is to be informed. G., and that his F. G. will ever not surrender with loud and strong confession, we have no doubt that the rumor that has arisen shall soon dissipate, as, God be praised, it has already begun to happen. For as long as the people do not learn a certain reason for it, they get tired of talking about it, even of hearing much about it, and slacken. If, however, the deal were first to be made public by public confession, the fire and shouting would start up again with unheard- of and so burdensome annoyance that it would be unaccountable even to God for the sake of conscience. Then also 


2) This is the last concern about the advice which the Landgrave had sent to Eisenach on July 22. It was submitted after the Elector had left Eisenach on July 18, sent after him, and immediately approved by him. On July 23, Briick and Pack wrote about it from Eisenach to the Hessian Chancellor Feige.

2493 





The superiors and males of the opposite part accept the matter with more trepidation, and think that it is time to make such a deal and not to let it go unchallenged, and first of all, since one would not only stand by the deed and the fact, but also publicly defend the matter, contrary to the imperial and ecclesiastical rights described and the common custom of all Christendom, contrary to the imperial and ecclesiastical rights described and the common custom of all Christendom, as a common right and permission, or even just as a Christian dispensation, and let that which is now still in quaestione facti come ad quaestionem juris. 

If the trade also remains in quaestione facti, and such an answer is given to the authorities once, or also to others, from which they note that it is not the opinion that one wants to carry out and protect such news, then the authorities will rather be inclined to do so, The authorities will rather be inclined to suppress the rumor, and by their actions not help to increase the annoyance, besides that the great lords have enough to do in these times, that they would much rather spare than burden’ themselves’ with unnecessary matters of evidence and_ legal execution; They will also doubtless consider, if 1) our gracious Lord of Hesse does not deny the matter and the requirement of public confession, 2) that it would be difficult for them to prove things legally. For there are few people who enjoy it, and in addition are engaged in their duties, not to report anything about it, that one would save them easily, and also slowly and with difficulty be able to testify about the deliberate things, contrary to their duties. 

In addition, if the fact were to be proven after long and many efforts, then all kinds of burdensome disputations would first occur, which they would much rather keep quiet about than have brought to light by their unnecessary pressing. Item, would also consider how difficult it might be for them to finally execute their and the 3) Court of Appeal's decision or verdict.

There is no doubt that all princes, princes and estates, both of heredity and of Christian understanding, would be more inclined and willing to be gracious, supportive and helpful to our gracious lord, the landgrave, since the matters remained in quaestione facti, than to be remembered in quaestione juris, because everyone, as is to be expected, will highly fear the dreadful and sinful annoyance, which is already noted from the uncertain rumor that has arisen, and will also consider his wife and children in it, because not all women are as kind as our gracious lady, the landgravine, shows herself to be kind and patient for the sake of such business. 

But on the other hand, we have heard in the town hall what concerns and complaints our gracious lord, the landgrave, has that his F. G. should deny the trade strack und rund (round) for reasons of convenience. 

Although we now 4) in submission consider that a strict denial before God and for the sake of conscience should have less of a burden on it, as would be indicated by many examples in Holy Scripture, because that with a strict and public confession and defense the great annoyance and the anxious apostasy of many good-hearted people should be confirmed, so we have noted from the submitted advice, what form, also on what form a middle and doubtful answer should take to the emperor, king, also to the chamber court and others, so that his F. G. should be given. Also Doctor Martinus Luther has indicated an opinion, not unserviceable, in this regard. 5) We have thought of another form, as noted on the enclosed note. And have done so, whether from the three harmless forms, such an answer can be drawn together, which nevertheless his F. GG. after opportunity unverweislich, and the authority, also others a reflection might make, on such once noted answer after the reason of the trade further not to ponder nor unnecessarily to research. 

But in addition to such concerns, necessary that our gracious

Lord, the landgrave, henceforth hold and collect with the things so that his F. G., contrary to such doubtful, unprovable answer, be less noted with the receipt, which would be done to our consideration and the rumor could be reduced and finally eliminated, namely, so that his F. G. put the person in a place so that the people would be less aware of her, 1) and rode secretly to her according to his F. G.'s liking, and let his F. G.'s husband be around his F. G. more often and more for a while, also showed themselves in other ways, as the presented advice indicated at the end. 

In all cases, however, it would be useful for his F. G. to bring back to himself the instruments that were made in the course of the trade, and otherwise leave them in no one's hands, for instruments are, as the legal scholars say 2)... 

If, however, the one from Brunswick would touch this matter in his further intended tender, we would consider in courtesy that it should not be necessary to discuss the trade extensively against this man, but that he should be given a mocking and insulting answer, and to answer fools foolishly, for he has too great a beam in his eyes that he can be answered in a dissolute manner, so that all the world would be well satisfied as against such a one, and especially 3) if the substance of the answer were included, as it is to be given to Imperial Maj. and others. Maj. and others would be considered and decided. 

As far as the other main point of the advice is concerned, namely: If the Superior would not be satisfied with the reported answer, but would further insist on the Landgrave, or have legal proceedings against his F. G. by the Court of Appeal or otherwise, we humbly consider that Imperial Maj. then can easily, after the opportunity of her 


1) Rudolph Walter (Gualterus) wrote to Heinrich Bullinger on Aug. 4, 1540: "She [Margaretha von der Sal] lives in a certain monastery in Wisenstain with several noble virgins whom she has at her service from the prince, and differs in nothing from a true princess, yes, she also wants to be held worthy of this honor and this name. As a gift, she has received, as the common rumor goes, twenty thousand florins." (Corp. Ref. , Vol. Ill, 1062, note). 

2) The end of this sentence is missing. 

3) Here we have deleted a superfluous "and". 


Maj.'s request, a further answer may be given and namely the previous answer raised, also all kinds of persuasiones introduced to induce Her Maj. not to punish (anten) this trade unnecessarily 4) nor to burden His Majesty with unknown and unprovable things. 

There is no doubt that the Electors and Princes of the Legion, as well as the estates of the Christian understanding, would, at the request of His Holiness, if the matter remained in quaestione facti, help Imperial Majesty to make all possible representations and show all fairness. Maj. and show themselves in all fairness; and not only the reported Electors, Princes and Estates, but also other Electors and Princes, of whom there are not a few, who think his F. G. friendly and well, who would also much rather see and hear that his F. G. would like to press the deal and not let it come to public speeches and disputations with annoyance 5). For if our gracious lord, the Landgrave, should lay himself on the exceptionally considered in the council proposal, his F. G. would make himself very suspicious of the matters, also almost confess, and especially with the 6) declinationes fori, as if such matter tamquam matrimonialis did not belong before a secular court, but a general council, because one would have to put the reason of such exception on a digamy. 

Therefore, the best would be to keep the things in terminis quaestione facti and in the rights, so in the Rathschlag allegirt, saying, quod occulta non ecclesia, to hear, 7) donec manent absque confessione vel probatione occulta, because there it says, as another text says: quod occulta non habent publicam vindictam. 

And if our gracious lord, the Landgrave, should ever be molested by the Court of Appeal, and his F. G. should not have reservations about it for other reasons, then in our opinion it would be much better if his F. G. recusirte the same, for which his F. G. should have suitable reasons, and have a well-formed recusirte put forward, which his F. G., praise be to God, should know well to put up, for with that, besides the secret, the F. G. should also have the right to make a recusirte.

hold, the things would probably and soon bleed to death. 

All of this we want to indicate for our serious concern on the above-mentioned, submitted advice for improvement, humbly asking to note the same not otherwise than faithfully and well-intentioned. 


No. 2692. (Eisenach.) July 20, 1540. Concerns about the landgrave's double marriage. 


Luther insists on secrecy of the confessional. 


From the original in the secret archive at Weimar, Reg. C, pag. 163, no. 19, fol. 115, printed by De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 272. 

As | have advised and asked from the beginning until now, so | still advise and ask (and this time for the last time. For | cannot do any more, nor will |, so that | finally leave it) most humbly, M. G. Herr, the Landgrave, wanted to draw this matter back into secrecy and keep it, for to publicly defend the right is impossible, as | said yesterday, and S. F. G. will learn in time that we have meant it cordially and faithfully with S. F. G. in such counsel, and God will give His blessing to it. 

If, however, S. F. G. of others, or also their F. G. themselves, want to reveal it to the Council, and want to burden churches and estates to defend such a matter, as they have to help, then it is fair and necessary that they all be asked and consulted beforehand. Otherwise, they shall and will refuse to defend themselves, as if they had no conscience, and D. M[artin] and M. Ph{ilippus] will not do anything with their authority (even if they could do it and justify something). 

And before | want to defend it obviously, | want to say no to my and M. Philipp's advice publicly presented, because it is not publicum concilium, and fit nullum per publicationem. Or if that would not help, | will rather confess, where it should be called a counsel and not rather (as it is) a request, that | have erred and deceived, and ask for mercy. For 





the annoyance is too great and unmistakable. And M. G. Herr, the landgrave, should consider that S. F. G. would have enough of it, that they may have the mead secretly with a good conscience, according to our confession, on their F. G. confession. 

Considering that S. F. G. has so no need nor causes for revelation, and can easily be kept in secrecy, thereby causing so much unpleasantness and unhappiness. 

I'm sticking with that.

To the Landgrave Philip of Hesse. 


Luther tries to persuade him that he must keep the double marriage secret for his own good. 


The original is in the Court and State Archives at Kassel. Printed in Niedners Zeitschrift fur die historische Theologie 1852, Heft Il, p. 275 and in De Wette-Seidemann, Vol. VI, p. 273. 

G. and F. in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! | have received E. F. G.'s writing, which, as it seems to me, is written out of an agitated mind, so that | am not aware that | should have deserved it. For as far as it seems to me, E. F. G. want to understand this trade as if we were doing it for our own sake, and not to degenerate E. F. G. to faithful subservient service, to E. F. G. in the future. Therefore, | hereby want to inform F.F.G. out of the right reason of my heart that | do not ask and warn so diligently against the revelation of the advice for my sake; F.F.G. should take it with pleasure and not doubt that it is not to be done for my sake. Even if all devils would have revealed the counsel, [I] still want to know how to answer them by God's grace, that they should have nothing against me. 

For | have the advantage that E. F. G. and all the devils themselves must testify and confess to me: first, that it is a secret counsel; second, that | have asked with all diligence that it not be revealed; third, if it comes to pass, | am sure that it is not revealed through me. As long as | have these three pieces, | will not counsel the devil himself to take my pen.

God will help me. | know well by God's grace to distinguish between what may be yielded by grace in distress of conscience before God, and what is not right before God in external being on earth apart from such distress. And don't like that E. F. G. should only get into the feather fight, E. F. G. have enough to do otherwise, and | do too. 

But this is the reason why | cannot and will not (as far as possible) let E. F. G. get into trouble, because they are in the confession with me, and | acknowledge my guilt as a Christian to advise and serve his neighbor to the best of his ability. 

For if E. F. G. reveals the advice right away, | don't care. But E. F. G.'s search is not achieved with it, and nothing is accomplished, except that E. F. G. makes things all the worse for E. F. G.'s own neck, so that we cannot help E. F. G. out of it again, however much we would like to and would like to. 

For E. F. G. will not be able to maintain that the world should accept such E. F. G. secret marriage for a public marriage, if they would present as many as a hundred Luthers, Philipses and others. They will say that Luther and Philipps do not have the power to set otherwise against public and praiseworthy law, although they are secretly guilty of advising otherwise for the sake of conscience. 

Since it must also happen in the world in such a way that no court must intervene in a foreign court, otherwise it would remain a desolate being and no court. In Saxon law, thieves are hanged; in Roman and Muslim law, they are not hanged, and many other such things. And yet God wants both of these repulsive laws to be considered law. How much more will he in this case want to have held the secular law against digamiam, and yet in koro [conscientiae] 1) have left his hands untied, diagamiam for necessary reasons against the secular law. 

Where now E. F. G. wants to go from God's judgment (who gives way with grace to necessity) into man's judgment through the revelation of the counsel, then E. F. G. must also be of human origin. 


1) The word missing here is said to have become illegible in the original (Seidemann). 


The right to suffer punishment without the protection and help of divine judgment, in which the F.F.G. are not included. For the sake of E. F. G.. God will not let the judgment of man, which he confirms, be torn apart, even if he has shown mercy in his judgment. And our doctrine freely confesses that we not only want to leave worldly rights unhindered (if they are not against God), but also want to help promote them. 

From this follows, where E. F. G. wants to stand on the revelation of the advice, that finally E. F. G. must do away with the metre again as a whore, or crawl again into this secret advice. It would be just as much with honor now as with shame afterwards. 

And what do E. F. G. fight about that, that they do not want to consider the Metze a whore? They must suffer now, before the counsel is revealed, that she is a whore before all the world, even though before the three of us, 2) that is, before God, she is considered no different than a conjugal concubine. What is it then, that E. F. G. must suffer such cries any longer, with a good conscience, out of which necessity (as we believe) such happens, that in E. F. G.'s conscience she is not a whore? F. G.'s conscience she is not a whore. 

| am writing all of this so that E. F. G. may hear that it is really not about me, who knows well to turn me out where it comes to the pen and to leave E. F. G. in. F. G. inside, which | do not want to do, because | cannot avoid it. For | do not intend to leave E. F. G. in this matter, as much as my mind and life are able, not only for E. F. G.'s sake, but also for E. F. G.'s sake. F. G. alone, but for the sake of the whole Confession, which is highly burdened with this matter. 

Therefore, E. F. G. does not worry how they do not want to let me out of the council, but much more, how they do not push me out violently with such a way. 

E. F. G. also wanted to think again how difficult it would be for the pious people, whom we otherwise plagued by the devil and all the world, to take such aversions upon themselves. For where a

Each one wants to carry out what he desires and put That serves nothing for the matter. For the choice it on the pious pile, which does not want to last long, should be free, and no one denies E. F.

It is God's will that either children come from this merry work, or fornication be avoided; otherwise | no longer know what the beautiful helps more. 

But | sincerely pray that God will not be suspicious| of me, as if I let myself be incited against God. | mean it from my heart, God knows that, and out of great concern that | bear for God; if God does not believe it, they will probably find out in the end, and then thank me in vain.

Since E. F. G. apologizes, they were fond of the mead before, also probably other before 





drink up, also to withdraw what can be withdrawn, so that the annoyance, which does not want to be defended, is quieted, because | do not see how E. F. G. can be urged to the revelation. And because E. F. G. does not allow himself to give an ambiguous answer where it should be, it is just as much said as that E. F. G. did not want to boast of the mead before the world. Thereby E. F. G. can well remain eternally and always be ambiguous, so it would send itself in a short time by God. 

Herewith | command E. F. G. to the dear God, because | mean it faithfully, what | want to advise my own soul.

Luther apologizes for his letter, promises not to publish the Rathschlag without the utmost necessity, but still, after the misgivings of the Saxon councilors, refuses to deny the matter. He has full confidence in Luther and believes that a personal discussion will soon lead to an understanding.

To the man to be highly honored in your Lord, Mr. Justus Menius, your faithful servant of God and disciple of Christ, his exceedingly dear brother. 

Grace and peace! It is nothing, my dear Justus, that 

you are concerned about how we have been exempted or treated in your house; more has happened than we deserved, and even more than we wanted. The will and the doing of all was exceedingly willing and diligent, especially of your wife. We taught your son Timotheus to steal nuts for the sake of pleasure, and this we saw and rejoiced in, and he alone was a very pleasant spectacle for us. "To my cousin, Heinrich Ludern", the older one, you will say that D. Teutleben (Dietlebius) has promised me that he will faithfully conduct this matter; with him | have also left the other things, but he shall not drive. | cannot remind Teutleben more than perhaps by a new letter, if it is necessary, which the old man himself should have known. By the way, what Georg Schnell had forgotten, since he received those 40 guilders from Weissensee in Eisenach, they retained 14 groschen for him there, | don't know under what title, which, as | remember, has not happened yet. It will therefore fall to you to investigate with what right they cut off these 14 groschen. 2) Because if

If they act sacrilegiously, it will have to be reported to the prince, so that one does not finally continue after the example to also cut off some guilders. If, however, there is any right, it must be carried out justly. On Tuesday after Cyriaci [August 10] 1540.

This request was brought to Luther and Melanchthon by Magister Christoph JahnO: "what in this case would be most advisable to do without danger to conscience: whether the Margrave, in order to have the opportunity in his office to be beneficial to the Gospel, would accept consecration, habit, order 2c. with a clear conscience and take the oath to the pope; or whether it would be more Christian, better, more beneficial and more blessed to leave the archbishopric out of his hands and give it into his hands". - Luther answered on October 10.

Luther responds to the information requested by a message about the book of the power of the keys, as well as about a letter (allegedly written by Luther) to Gregory (pastor iu Jung-Bunzlau in Bohemia) to the effect that the latter had scolded the book translated into Bohemian and declared it heretical, which is why a student wrote a sharp letter under Luther's name to Gregory, who sent it back to Luther. Luther's verdict was now this: If the book is faithfully translated, it should remain so; Luther had also proved to the priest in a letter the incorrectness of the papist doctrine of the power of the keys. Although he agrees with your student, he wants to punish the letter writer. If Gregory's opinion is that Christ's power of absolution is different from Peter's, it is incorrect, as is the opinion that Peter could have absolved by his own power, because Peter's office of absolution is Christ's office; there are not two different offices.

(Wittenberg.) August 27, 1540. To Anton Lauterbach in Pirna. 


Luther apologizes for not being able to come to the wedding of Lauterbach's brother (cf. No. 2660), and gives him advice because of a peevish trade in his official conduct.

To the man to be highly honored in the Lord, M. Anton Lauterbach, the faithful bishop and his extremely dear [friend] in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | will gladly be at your brother's wedding, my dear Anton, but in spirit and with my prayers. For the fact that | will not be there in body is not only due to the amount of business, but also because | realize, or rather | know, that the Mammelucken and the queen of this kingdom are offended, for which | am perhaps somewhat to blame. And who is not offended by Luther's nonsense? 

| advise you to be patient with your mistresses, who (as you write) stubbornly hold on to one figure (pertinacibus unispeciebus), and let the drunken Satan rage as long as it pleases God. You must bear the trouble and in the meantime exhort the others, as you do, to the institution of Christ, and be sure that you will cause the devil greater trouble in his kingdom than those impotent ones. kingdom than those powerless mistresses (domicellas) in the kingdom of Christ. God will also put an end to these things. Only you shall despise and shun these people (eos), and let them despise and shun you. You are a public servant of the preaching ministry, those are private and few; at last they will be overcome. Fare well with your own. My Lord Kathe greets you.

Johannes Weif3 (Weis), the deacon of our church, told me when | returned home from the Hagenau Convention that he had been given hope that through your mediation he would receive an increase in his salary if | informed the most illustrious prince about the state of his affairs. Accordingly, at his request, | explained to the prince that he had 65 florins a year, 5 malt of wheat and ten ounces of wood. In addition, from the vicariate of the convent of the Holy Virgin 20 florins or a little more. The family consists of 9 persons, and | myself have asked that his salary be increased. But the most noble prince answered me that he knew nothing of your use, but that intercession had been made for another deacon, and that he had also received as much as he had wanted. But since he now asks me, | would also like to support his cause with you, and ask you, if you are able to do such a thing, to be helpful to him.

Landgrave Philip to Luther and Melanchthon. 


The landgrave informs them that Elector Joachim of Brandenburg and Duke Heinrich of Saxony had sent an envoy to him because of his double marriage, what they had asked of him, and what answer he had given them. Now he asks for advice, what he should do, if he "would get harder". - The Landgrave's answer, dated Friedberg, August 27, was friendly, but negative: he intended to lead and complete his life in such a way that it would be acceptable before God. 


1) The name of the letter writer is missing, but it can hardly be doubtful that it was Menius. For we see from the letter that the writer belonged to the deputies at the convention at Hagenau, and Johannes Wei was Diaconus of the church at Eisenach (see Corp. Ref., Vol. Ill, 708).

Our dear will beforehand. Dear, dear friends! We do not want to deprive you of your trustworthy opinion that a few days ago Margrave Joachim, Elector of Brandenburg, and Duke Heinrich of Saxony had their excellent envoys with us and had them advertise to us for the sake of the matter in hand. They have also received an answer from us, as the enclosed copies signed A. B. show, which answer we do not consider to be unequal according to the advice that you and subsequently also others, the Elector's councillors, recently considered at Eisenach, for we also drew it from such. Although we had an inclination to answer these envoys in 2) somewhat more harshly and to tell them that their masters should not worry about our housekeeping, but should look after their wives and children and people, and that we would leave them unperturbed in their housekeeping, we have nevertheless used the most lenient, and if we would like to remain with our given answer, that would be dear to us; but if we should be more harshly attacked, then let us know your concern as to what we should then further answer. That we do not deny too much, nor confess too much, that should not be lacking in us, for we would gladly remain in your advice, if we did not press too hard, and would not save you this, that nevertheless we also have a knowledge, so in your gracious opinion. You will find us inclined in all Christian and reasonable matters to show you mercy and good and as much as we are able. 3) Date Zapfenburg, on the first of September, Anno 1540.

To D. Jerome Weller, the servant of Christ. 

Grace and peace! Have nothing to do, my dear Jerome, with those who want the Buhlhauser to be restored. It would have been more tolerable if the devil had not been cast out than if he had been let in anew and fortified anew. Those who want to restore the Buhl houses may first renounce the name of Christ and be pagans who do not know God. We Christians, if we want to be such, have a manifest word of God: "God will judge fornicators and adulterers," much more those who favor them, protect them, assist them with counsel and help. How else could one teach publicly against fornication, if one had to praise the authorities who allow fornication? But, they say, according to the words of Augustine, everything will be infected with fornication (libidinibus). Against this, by God's grace, there is a remedy, namely marriage or the hope of marriage. But what is the need for marriage as a remedy or the hope of it, if we allow fornication to go unpunished? We have learned that when the Buhl houses were flourishing under the S,atan, things were not only not advised, but rather, through the example of free fornication, profanation and adultery were increased, which was also publicly known. Now that, thank God, fornication is forbidden, there is less profanation and adultery, especially in public. Let the authorities (because they want to be Christian) punish both fornication and profanation as well as adultery, at least if it is obvious; if such things happen secretly a lot, they are excused. Summa: Against God we can do nothing, nor permit, nor tolerate. What is right must be done, even if the world would perish over it. (Fiat justitia et pereat mundus.) Farewell. In haste.

pray for him and approve his absolution, which he humbly asks for. Then, before the high altar before which he kneels, you shall publicly exhort him to repent and to accept the faith of absolution and not to doubt it; then you shall absolve him in the usual form and say in a loud voice: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Before the absolution at the altar, the choir should first sing the psalm: "God, be merciful to me according to your goodness" [Ps. 51]. 

The church order of your prince pleases me quite well, as far as doctrine and faith are concerned. If you wish, you can also anoint the sick and confirm adults for a while, because he says they are not sacraments; a free conscience can perform a _ ceremony immediately. If, however, you find yourself complaining about something, follow the example of the priest in Spandau, who, having been called from Zerbst, did not want to come until the prince promised and allowed that he should be free of these things. | think that these additions will not last long, especially the excessive amount of masses and other offices, since they have begun to be despised and to disintegrate into themselves; through the weariness of them and the contempt of the people, it will not last long. In the meantime one must serve the things that are free 1) and the common salvation of souls. Ask the same for me. On the Monday after the Nativity of the Virgin Mary [Sept. 13] Anno 1540.

Martin Luther's answer to the Landgrave of Hesse about his affairs, copied from his own handwriting. 

| have written it to the landgrave so that | like such a mild answer, given this time. The Margrave has also written to me and pondered the same matter, but | have not yet answered him, but | want to answer along with other things, namely that | know nothing about the matter, without what the cry gives, as Christ in the Gospel of Marci 13. does not know about the last day, and may say this with a clear conscience. For what | know secretly and confessionally, | know only before God and secretly, and not before men, nor shall | want to know it; and whether | have said it, I shall not be believed, juxta illud: unius testimonium nullum. 

But if they continue to hold out, he may give them a sharper answer, which he himself shows me, 1) and, because they want to be friends, would do wrong to be the first to stir up and attract such clamor even more, if they should be the first (if they wanted to be so holy and pure) to help quench and muffle such clamor. 

If they knew something about this from the Scriptures, they should do all the more to stop it, because otherwise both friend and foe would keep silent and not believe. 

With it | wish at last that the surly, coarse Dresdeners 2) would finally have to become disgraced with the Copei, because they do not have the main letter and seal. 

This has become the substance of the letter.

3) The title of this book is: "Justi Menii Book, that it is not fitting for a Christian to have at one time more than one wife 1.5.4.0" (Corp. Ref., Vol. | V, 767 f.). 





4) who had driven this thing hard and, as they say, caused it. Whether it is to be omitted at this time, has probably a doubt: first, that it would move suspicion, as if there were something in the matter, and might strengthen the cry; secondly, Melsingen might answer it. Finally, Luther would ask even more questions and perhaps request that | write as well. Then | would rather let it settle itself as it has begun, than stir the mud before the noses of all the world. Otherwise, people are in the mood to know and research too much about new and dangerous things, so that it seems to me that in such cases, silence is not only a responsum, but also an Optimum responsum. 

But it is not against us, because Mr. Just proceeds contra legem et exemplum publicum polygamiae, which we also do, and not contra necesitatem et casualem dispensationem individuae personae, of which we have acted as confessors. He also excuses the old fathers too weakly, and one or two consequences therein are not strong enough; sea habet nihil ad rem. Martin Luther.

G. u. F. Serene, highborn prince, gracious lord! Upon E. F. G. Envoy's request on behalf of the bishop of Riga 2c. is easily and recently my concern: Since the pope has been a murderer of souls for so many hundred years, and (as Apocalypsis (Cap. 17, 4. f.) shows) his church is the red whore with the golden cup full of fornication, and on her forehead vain names of all blasphemy 2c. 2c. There is no other counsel here than that which is written in the same book (Cap. 18, 4.): Flee from her, lest her plague fall upon you 2c. For she is drunk with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus 2c. Therefore, let E. F. G. be courageous and confidently help that the devil in Rome is not resisted or confirmed, as it is, 1) since it is to be hoped, because the abomination has been cast out by God, that he shall not return to his power, as Daniel (Cap. 11, 45.) says: Venit ad summitatem ejus et nemo auxiliabitur etc.. Nevertheless, we see that no one helps him (which he himself also feels), even though many kings act as if they wanted to, and yet do nothing. This is how God wants it, because the time of his end has come and wants to be over 2c. Therefore, E. F. G. continue and let either the bishop of Rigen be elected and confirmed by the chapter, or under the name of the bishop be a perpetual e/ectus (as was often done before) or aajutor, until the water runs out 2c. 

Others will probably write to E. F. G. in the new newspaper. A day has now been set aside by the Emperor at Worms for Simonis and Juda [Oct. 28], when the theologians on both sides are to hold a sub- speech; this is, they are to lose time, consume money and miss everything at home or suffer damage.

In the last days of the year 154t or at the beginning of 1542 Luther wrote the "Antwort D. M. L. auf das Buch Nebulonis Tulrichii'; however, the same was not finished. 

1) To this advice of Luther, the duke replied: that as much as he and his brother would be inclined to follow this advice, the chapter, the knighthood and the countryside nevertheless insisted so firmly on the papal confirmation, consecration 2c., that his brother would not be able to avoid to make himself comfortable to this mummery, and believes that this can also be done with a good conscience, so that the spreading of the divine doctrine is promoted by him (De Wette). 





we must let your devil go like this; but what will happen is easy to understand. There is nothing else, except that Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is accused of being an arch-murderer, who is said to have sent out many hundreds of murderers against the Protestant estates, more than three hundred have already been directed, many of whom confess disgrace to His Grace, also to the Bishop of Mainz 2c. What will become of it, God knows. It is impossible that such murder-burning should not come from high estates; for there is money enough, the pope is said to have given eighty thousand ducats for it. We must hear and suffer such things, but God will pay them abundantly here and there, and yet they shall not win; though they burn us all to ashes, yet shall they burn in hell in the fire under our feet forever, amen.

To the men gifted with excellent scholarship and virtue, Mr. Johann Weinlaub, Councillor of the most illustrious Margrave, Elector 2c., and Mr. Jakob [Stratner], 1) preacher, overseers of the churches in the Mark, his friends. 

Salvation! As the church is in misery in the world, so the teachers of the true gospel are strangers, not without great difficulties. Since they carry around with them the immensely great treasure, namely the Gospel of the Son of God, it behooves all to desire to associate with such guests. And the story of the widow of Sarepta reminds us how pleasant it is for God to receive the piety of those who hospitably receive the priests, the expounders of the true doctrine. For God, for the sake of the Gospel, preserves the human race, the worldly rule and the continuity of the essence of things, and bestows what serves life. We testify that this honest man, Conrad Cordatus, an Austrian, Doctor of Theology, is well versed in church doctrine, teaches the gospel purely, has godly morals and is gifted with a special constancy in faith. For this he proved not only in enduring the common toils of the preaching ministry, in which he showed the greatest diligence, but also in other exceedingly hard plagues. For since he taught the Gospel in a certain church in Austria (Pannonia) in a humble, godly manner and according to his rightful profession, the tyrannical bishops threw him into prison for no other reason than because he had presented the correct doctrine that was necessary for the church. And since they threatened the man deprived of all his goods with death if he did not abandon the Gospel, he was kept in prison for a long time. But finally, because his innocence was known to all, he was released and returned to the school, where he not only listened to the teachers with great diligence, but also presented the church doctrine to others. After he was put in charge of the congregations, he governed them faithfully, and most vehemently criticized the

2) in Wittenberg. Cf. St. Louis edition, vol. XXII, introduction, p.4bf. 





He has defended the purity of doctrine against all fanatical opinions. We give him this testimony of his scholarship and godliness with a clear conscience, and would have gladly kept him if he had remained with us. But because he is called to teach the gospel, he has in a godly way maintained that other churches must also be served, and we have not been opposed to his very good will. For what is more desirable than that God should call and raise up such servants in great numbers into the harvest of the Gospel? But since you are charged with the supervision of the churches in the Mark, we have given him this letter to you, following the example of the old churches, so that you may know that we approve of his teaching and his customs. We urge you and others who love the gospel of the Son of God to receive and support this guest, who is to be revered because of his age, his learning, his godliness and because of the confession of the gospel. We hope that his work will be useful to the churches of Christ. Furthermore, it behooves us to receive such guests with all the greater goodwill and to protect them, because for their sake God defends our churches against the tyrants, so that the light of the Gospel is not completely extinguished, and their families have a number of little nests. Therefore, we commend to you the Lord Cordatus, Doctor of Theology, and ask God, the Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, to restore and govern your churches. Be well. On the 12th day of October, Anno 1540. Martin Luther, D. Joh. Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, D., the D. Cordatus brother in Christ, because of the exceedingly loud teaching of Christ. Philip Melanthon.

To Martin Luther. 

Hail! Two from the Academy in Leipzig are traveling to Worms, Scheubel and Camitianus, 1) provided with the honorable instruction that they are not to accept anything that deviates from the doctrine of the Confession. | also hear that it was strictly demanded of the Academy that no one should revile the right doctrine or the restored customs. | am glad that the Mysians are waking up a bit. Yesterday the musician Sixtus Dieterich came to me, who has gone to see you. He brought letters from Veit in Nuremberg, in which he indicates that Eck is already holding triumphs because of the convention at Worms; so much hope and confidence, they say, he has through the deed of Jason. 2) When those intriguers, Eck, Nausea and Cochlaus, 3) are confronted, the disputation will be very short. For with those who pretend to strive for concord, there would be more to create.

To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg. The Holy Roman Empire's Archmarshall and Elector, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg, our gracious Lord. 

Most Serene, Highborn Prince and Lord! E. C. F. 

G. are ready to God our prayer with submissive, obedient services always with diligence before. Most gracious Lord! E. C. F. G. is undoubtedly unaware of the feud of Heinrich Queissen against the Bishop of Lebus, which has occurred. Because of this, by Mr. Nikeln von Minkwitz, knight, an intervention together with some helpers happened at that time at Furstenwald) But now the same Heinrich Queiss has let us know how such feud and action between the bishop of Lebus, the Sachewald, Mr. Niklassn von Minkwitz, all helpers and helper assistants shall be completely settled and agreed upon, so that all helpers and those involved in the matter shall be taken to grace and again left and come to their estates. Only he, the aforementioned Heinrich Queissen, is still deprived of his goods. Because he is an old, weak man, about ninety years of age, has no place of his own and is eager to turn to E. C. F. G. as to Herzberg, he has asked us most earnestly to request him from E. C. F. G. that the same E. C. F. G. will accept him as a subject of the place and in gracious protection. We have considered his age and do not know how to refuse him such a request. We therefore humbly request that E. C. F. G. take heed of the poor old man's plight and, if E. C. F. G. is pleased, graciously accept him as a subject and under his protection and show him mercy. For the sake of E. C. F. G.'s blessed and praiseworthy regiment towards God.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotees! We have read your intercessory letter concerning Heinrich Quei, whom we should accept into our city of Herzberg and into our protection. 2c. Now we know to remember that the invasion of Firstenwald has happened, thereby many of the nobility have come into complaint, which has been settled in part; we would also have provided that the said QueiB would not have forgotten his trustee, and have brought the matter to an agreement (vorbit) and [by] 1) the proper means. But since this, as we note from your letter, did not happen, you yourselves must consider that we do not have unreasonable reservations about letting the said Queiss come under us and accept him into our protection, because we fear that we [un] 2) and our subjects might thereby incur a loss, which we and they would otherwise be left, since you know without that how closely 3) they are looking for us at present, and the bishop of Lebus at least would not refrain from writing to us about it, thereby causing us to put ourselves in counter-scripts again, that 4) we would rather have a treaty with him and other papist bishops. For this reason you will know how to reject the said quarrel. This is what we want to report to you again, to whom we are inclined to mercy and good. Date Torgau, Monday after Ursula [Oct. 25] Anno 1540.

Grace and peace. Most noble, highborn prince, most gracious lord! | had hoped that we would have persuaded Doctor Creutz, bailiff at Colditz, to give the fief to poor Bernhard, but he has learned to remain silent. If he does not like to answer, we have to let it go, and again, according to God's right, let it happen to him that an erosio in domo impii happens, as Solomon says [Proverbs 3, 33], and where he gains one guilder with the fief, he loses ten. Now Doctor Brick, as | have reported, has put him off, he wants to ask for help for him, that he might otherwise be provided for, and has asked me to also ask. Where E. C. F. G. know how to help, they will graciously assist; he must be fed by us as long as he is with us. E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously keep him in this. Hereby commanded to the dear GOD, Amen.

Melanchthon to Luther, Jonas, and Bugenhagen. 


Melanchthon speaks about the deceitfulness of the adversaries who brought about the Worms Convention, whose negotiations will begin with the arrival of Granvella. Of the rumor about the coming of Thomas Campegius, Thomas Badia and Peter Danes. Of Link's and Osiander's dispatch by the city of Nuremberg. 


From a copy in Cod. Lips. printed in Corp. ref. vol. Ill, 1129. 


To the highly famous and valuable men, Doctor Martin L., D. Justus Jonas, D. Johann Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, the leaders of the church at Wittenberg, his extremely dear patrons. 

Hail! Never have we been ambushed in a more artful way than by the pretext of this meeting, in which, as the adversaries posed, it was supposed to be about harmony, about the healing of the churches. But, in fact, it has been avoided that we should be condemned by the previous verdict of this meeting, since the concilium appointed by the Roman Pontiff has had no progress. The most hostile vipers to this cause have been brought, as the list shows, which | have enclosed, and instead of the [Bishop] of Trier, the Mainzer will preside over the Convent. Thus the one will have three votes. And about Granvella | hear that he is coming here, not to alleviate the discord, but because it is hoped that some will fall away. But the negotiations have not yet begun, because they are still waiting for Granvella. 2) If our great ones (heroibus) were as generous as the good nature of the matter demands, we could easily remedy these difficulties. For after we have arrived here, the eight has been proclaimed against those at Goslar because of a certain monastery. Since this is done by the adversaries at the time of the truce, what are ours doing in the meantime? We hear that from the city of Rome come the bishop of Feltre, the brother of Campegius, 3) who has with him the magister of the palace, a theologian. 


1) See St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 400 - There Col. 401, line 5 v. o. read: "Danesius" instead of: "Damasius".

and another, a certain Peter Danesius, 4) who interpreted Demosthenes in Paris, an eloquent man; for | have seen his writings. When these have come, the protestation 5) about the prestige of the pope will have to be opposed to them. | fear, however, that just at this first meeting there will be a separation of ours, although among the preachers who are here, by God's grace, there is unanimity in doctrine. The other messengers of ours also still agree with each other. These are the ones sent from Nuremberg, D. Wenceslaus and Osiander. For the fact that Osiander doubted, as | wrote from Leipzig, 6) was due to the fact that the council had not yet received the letter from our prince. For you know that the letter from the emperor to our prince was brought to our prince shortly before our departure. Many tales are told of the King of France, of the Turks, and of other kings, but | do not consider them worth telling, and you know how great the disloyalty of these is. Granvella recently had Vesontio, a preacher of the Protestants, killed. Namely, he came from there to establish the godly doctrine. For we have decided to mention this as an entrance. Pray for the Church of the Son of God. | will write as often as we have messengers. Be well. Worms, November 4, Anno 1540. 7) Phil. Mel.

We arrived here, for which God would give His blessing, by God's grace, healthy and safe, last October. We met some of our people who had preceded us. In the meantime, the others have followed, and there is a large gathering of the opponents, although not all of them are here yet, and it seems that the Convention will be well-attended and numerous. Would God that something worthy of such great expectation would be acted upon. The list of those who are already present here will be sent to you. They have not yet begun to act, and perhaps in a few days they will not even begin. For they are waiting for the emperor's envoy, Granvella, who is now held in the highest esteem by the emperor and governs everything. It is known that he is on ajourney, but he makes | do not know what detours because of his affairs. He will be the arbiter of these actions for which this convention is scheduled. But what is to be hoped from the conversation, we do not see yet. The beginnings, or rather the preparations, show that the adversaries do not come with such an attitude that they counsel in a godly and right way of harmony, but they have other plans. First of all, after the verdict of the Camerae (Court of Appeal), the eight has been proclaimed against those at Goslar, and now they continue to aim similar projectiles against others as well. Then, contrary to what had been agreed upon before, for the [bishop] of Trier the Mainzer has been put in the place among the presidents, who has brought with him the most impudent and unclean monsters of men, the most poisonous enemies of the right doctrine. The others are of the same kind, among whom the most distinguished and the leader _is Eck. He confidently promises himself | do not know what kind of victories. He boasts that he is so equipped to defend the papal teachings and to refute our doctrine that we should not even snatch from them the holy water consecrated with sharp salt. How this is consistent with the right and godly actions of the discussion that has taken place is easy to see. Therefore, there can hardly be any hope from the opposing side, so that | fear that time may be spent in vain as the day approaches when the Diet of Regensburg is scheduled for the month of January. If anything can be done by the adversaries, there is no doubt that they will condemn us who are crushed by the number of votes. But if anything 


What actions will be taken, we will write to you after that. In the meantime, we entrust ourselves and this whole matter to your prayers. By God's grace, Philip has been in good health and good and cheerful spirits both on the journey and here until now. | entrust my house and family to you. In my name, greet all of ours, the most reverend Lord (Mfagnificum] Dfominum)).

Before letters are sent to you by letter carriers, the fourth day passes. Yesterday Alexander Alesius 2) arrived with your letter, dearest father, which has cheered up both Philip and me. But now we are already expecting other, more recent letters from you, which will give us news of all your conditions. No trial has yet begun here. Two days ago the Pope's legate arrived, the Archbishop of Feltre (Véelitrensis), the brother of Cardinal Campegius. The adversaries are now conferring with him, no doubt about the beginning and progress of the actions. For he has orders to begin the business, even if not all are there yet who will preside over the parley, and perhaps Granvella will not be present so shortly. But it seems that those will not hurry very much. We do not think that there will be long arguments with the opponents. For the popes will hardly suffer that the power of the bishops is shaken by us,

Approximately the same content as the two previous letters (No. 2722 and 2723) to which Bucer refers. He also reports that the bishop of Feltre boasts that he has orders from the pope to concede very many and very great things. This, however, would be handled in such a way that the Antichrist would retain his tyranny. The bishop of Seckau 1) had arrived. One expects those of Cologne and Trier 2c. In the postscript, he indicates that the landgrave had given strict orders not to slacken on necessary doctrines of religion, but only to give an explanation.

She asks that you deliver this letter of the prince, which is addressed to your treasurer, and at the same time also urge him, as she has asked, that he may also kindly give usable, especially strong oak trunks, so that there is not (as it often happens) displeasure over the gift obtained from the benevolent prince, which one must receive, corrupted by the malice of the officials.

To M. Anton Lauterbach, Bishop of Pirna and the neighboring churches, his brother who is very dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace! My Lord Kathe was absent in her new realm, my dear Anton, when your letter was delivered, but | say thanks in her place for the pressed (succulato) cheese. But | do not care for such artists and am satisfied with our cheeses of simple material and ordinary form. Yes, it is not necessary that you be much concerned, as you do us good. It is enough that we are sure of your very good will, of which we can avail ourselves if it should be necessary, as we have availed ourselves of it more than enough so far. 

We have not yet received anything from Worms, except that such a large number of learned people gathered there from Italy, France, Spain and Germany that Philip himself writes that even in some papist synod there would not have been such a large preparation. God knows what will happen. If the Emperor's mind is right, as one suspects, then this convention without the name of a council will undoubtedly be a true provincial council, namely under the name of a private conversation. So that the pope would not be offended and could complain, they would meet there without 2) the name of a provincial council, without his authority. Of course, he has the bishop of Feltre as his legate there, but ours will not admit him as judge, arbitrator, or presiding officer, even if the pope himself were there. For they have been commanded to do so. We want to pray, you pray, all of you should pray, because an extraordinary crisis seems to want to occur here. Farewell and greet your vine and grape. In haste and among much business. On the Saturday after Catharine [Nov. 27]. Mart. Luther.

| have been so taken in by your gentle manners and mild character, which, however, is faithful through the spirit of Christ, that | have always mentioned you in the friendliest way when the opportunity presented itself. Yes, | was also particularly attracted to you by the fact that | see that so much fruit has come forth in the Gospel through your walk under the leadership of Christ. | give thanks to God and ask that He, who began the work of His grace and glory in you, may complete it to the end, in which we shall rejoice (as Peter says) with joy unspeakable. Therefore | exhort you to continue and to grow stronger day by day by the power of the Spirit of Christ who dwells in you. Furthermore, since | have understood that you are not a little moved by the arrival of "Master Grickel" from Eisleben with you, | indeed grieve with you, but again | admonish you that you despise Satan, even if he should become annoying to you in this piece, with a Christian mind. Master Grickel" is not the man he would like to seem, or what the margrave thinks he is, and never will be. For if you want to know what vanity itself is, you cannot get to know it in a more certain image than that of Eisleben. You can perceive it in his gesture, his voice, his loud laughter, yes, in all the movements and ways of his mind and body, so that he could surpass any buffoon. My advice has been that he should abstain from the administration of the word forever and take up some kind of amusing profession; he is not at all suitable for teaching. And if everything else were bearable, the senseless striving for fame is so great in him that he can do GOtte no good in his work, but a great deal of harm. But the new 1) affection of the margrave does not yet suffer a memory, but this will occur when this affection makes him regretful.

have endured for so long. However it may be, you can be convinced of this by me: even if "Master Grickel" is elevated to heaven by himself or by his own, he will not be less impure in my heart compared to you than the devil is compared to an angel. He certainly asks for forgiveness of his sins, and the margrave will believe that he asks earnestly, and we want to grant him pardon, although we suspect, nay, are certain, that he deals in deceit. But as he says: You will not deceive me, the teacher, but yourself. But this | write, that thou mayest not doubt my cordial disposition toward thee, and bear him the more patiently, nor for his sake forsake thy office. His vanity will not last. Fare well in the Lord, and in my name greet Mr. Weinlaub 2) most humbly. For | hear that he is earnestly favorable to the gospel, and not of the kind of Grickel.

The Lord will, as He promised, give you His Spirit, for "it is not you who speak" [Matt. 10:20]. We pray and hope here that this conversation will be nothing. We have seen the emperor's edict here and are having it printed so that the emperor's will may be known to the world. Of course, at first sight | thought, as others did, that it was invented to disturb this discussion, but Satan's hatred is more satanic than that he could invent other things than those that he knows are harmful to us.

History of the martyrdom of D. Robert Barnes in London, England. With a preface by D. Martin Luther. 


Completed in print in early December 1540. 


This history, which Melanchthon had sent to Luther on Nov. 14 (see No. 2728), appeared at the beginning of December (see No. 2757) in a single edition under the title: "Confession of Faith, which Robertus Barns, Doctor of Holy Scripture (in German lands called D. Antonius), made at Lunden in England. Anno 1540, on the 30th day of the month of July, when he was led to the fire without judgment and right, innocent, ""interrogated fact, and burned. Germanized from the English language. With a preface by Luther. Wittenberg 1540." In the editions: in the Wittenberg (1553), vol. VI, p. 417; in the Altenburg, vol. VII, p. 422; in the Leipzig, vol. XXI, p. 367 and in Walch, vol. XXI, 186*. Only the preface in the Jena edition (1568), vol. VII, p. 391 and in the Erlangen, vol. 63, p. 396. We give the text according to the Wittenberg edition. - On Barnes, see St. Louis edition, vol. XIV, 370, note. 


Preface Doct. Martini Luther. 


This Doctor Robertus Barns, who, out of special humility, did not want to be called a doctor in our country, called himself Antonius, for he had reasons, because he had previously been imprisoned in England by the holy bishops, Saint Papists, and had been redeemed with great difficulty, - This doctor, | say, we know well, and it is a special joy for me to hear that our good pious table companion and housemate is so graciously called by God to shed his blood for the sake of his dear Son, and to become a holy martyr, Thanks, praise and glory be to your Father of our dea Lord Jesus Christ, who has let us see the time again, as in the beginning, in which his Christians have 





It was and still is the wretched, flattened papacy that left us no saint on earth, except that he called himself the Holy of Holies and charged us with self-chosen saints, knowing full well that it would be just as true as if he called the devil the Holy of Holies. No more of this now. 

Since this holy martyr, Saint Robert, heard at that time that his king (with leave) Heinz of Engeland was hostile to the pope, he came again to Engeland, with hope to plant the gospel in his fatherland, and finally brought it to pass. To speak briefly of it, Heinz of Engeland let him like it, as is his way, until he sent him out, also to us in Wittenberg, in the marriage matter, about which thirteen universities had judged (as they said), and all of them gave Heinzen the right that he should take his queen, Mrs. Katherin, Emperor Karel's wife, away from him, and take another one (which he had done long before). 

But since we had acted for a long time, and our most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, had suffered a great deal, it turned out in the end that Heinze of England had not auditioned his message because he wanted to become a Protestant, but that we in Wittenberg should agree to his repudiation or marriage, and | became exceedingly unhappy that |, together with our theologians, had worked so many weeks with them in the matter of religion, and when we came to the end, they said: Their king would not suffer the four things, both the form of the sacrament, priestly marriage, the mass and monasticism to be abolished. Yes, | said, now we have been well tossed about for so long; they should have let us know that first. Your king takes the money from the pope and keeps his regiment, so Heinz is pope, and pope is Heinz in Engeland. 

He himself, Doctor Robertus Barns, often said to me: Rex meus non curat religionem, sed est etc.. But he loved his king and fatherland so fiercely that he 


passed away before our eyes and from our eyes and} gladly bore all this and always thought of helping the from our sides to the torture, that is, to heaven, andj Country; and it is true that it would have to be a become saints who have eaten and drunk with us (as| Shameful rogue who did not want to be favorable to the apostles say of Christ Act. 10, 1) 41) and have his fatherland and did not wish his prince every good, rejoiced in honor. Who would have believed it 20] aS not only the Scriptures but also all rights teach. years ago that Christ, our Lord, would be so close to| !herefore he had always

the word in the mouth: Rex meus, regem meum, as his confession indicates that he meant the regem meum until his death with all love and loyalty, which is nevertheless badly rewarded by the king. Hope deceived him, for he always hoped that his king would ultimately be good. 

Among other things, we often discussed why the king should have the abominable title: Defensor fidei, et in terris caput supremum et immediatum post Christain ecclesiae Anglicanae. But there was an answer, which read so much: it volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas, that one also sees now more well that Junker Heinze wants to be God, and do what he desires. 

But the reason why he was martyred is still hidden, because Heinze must be ashamed. But it is similar to what many honest people testify orally, namely that Doctor Barns (like Saint John the Baptist against Herod) spoke against Heinze, and did not want to consent to the blasphemous deed, that he rejected the Lady of Julich and took another; for what Junker Heinz wants, that shall be an article of faith, both to life and death. For Doctor Barns himself told me here that Morus and the bishop of Rossen (Roffen) were also almost executed by Heinzen because they did not want to agree to Heinz's article, which he had written. 

But we let Heinzen go to his Heinzen, with his Heinzen, where they belong. We should thank God, the Father of all mercy, that He can use such devils and devil larvae so masterfully for our and all Christians’ salvation, and for the punishment of both you and all who do not want to know God, as He has always done through the great tyrants. (As St. Paul says Rom. 8, 28.) [To those who love God,] 1) everything that is, happens, is done and is suffered must come to good. And again, all that is done to the worst of those who persecute God's children, just as is now happening to our Heinzen murderer, who creates so much good by doing harm that | think that even if he were to go to paradise, his wickedness should nevertheless bring him all the

to hell that what he wanted did not happen. More and better about that another time. Let us praise and thank God: It is a blessed time of Christ's chosen saints, and an unhappy, sorrowful time of the devil, blasphemers and enemies, and shall become even worse, amen. 


[Confession of Faith of D. Robert Barnes.] 

Anno 1540, in the month of July, Robertus Barns, who for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ had been placed in the tower of Lunden in England, was taken to the place called Schmidfelde, where he was burned. 

On the way, he spoke kindly to many people in both English and German, comforted and blessed them, and went to his torture with such great joy that he never changed his color. 

When he had come to the fire, where he was to end his life with a blessed end, he began to confess his faith, in which he intended to die and suffer the great torture, and began to speak, as follows: 

That he believes that there is an eternal, almighty, living God, who created heaven and earth and all that is in them for our benefit by his almighty wisdom and power. 

That One God is, and three persons of the one divine being, of equal power and glory. 

That Adam was created righteously pious, and that he and all of us became sinners through his fall, and thereby subjected to death, malediction, the devil and hell. 

That God has taken care of the human race from the beginning out of pure mercy and has promised it salvation and blessedness. 

That the Son of God became man for our salvation and blessedness, and that He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of Mary, the virgin who gave birth and who remains forever. 

That Mary, the virgin, conceived and gave birth to Jesus Christ without the knowledge and will of any man. 

He also completely rejected the Anabaptist opinion that the Lord Christ did not receive flesh or blood from Mary, but confessed that he believed that Jesus Christ was truly God and man, who lived among us, yet without sin, in the world as another man, preaching and proclaiming the will of his Father. 


2) Wittenberger: "in die Thire"; Walch: "in den Thur". 


2546 


That he was finally condemned to death and suffered death on the cross. 

That the Lord Jesus Christ by his death reconciled the human race to God the Father, and that by his precious blood, shed for our sins, he took away all our guilt and punishment; that all the merits of the Lord Christ are to our credit, and that in him we have done all that he has done for our righteousness and redemption. 

He also said and confessed that there is nothing in this world by which we can be justified and saved, but only by the one suffering of Jesus Christ, the Lord, who alone can be sufficient and blameless before God. And testified that he would rely solely on the merit of Jesus Christ the Lord, not doubting that he would thereby, by God's grace and mercy, receive forgiveness of sin and eternal life. 

But since he and his kind, who praise God's grace and the righteousness of faith, are said to reject good works, he called God to witness that, in addition to the doctrine of the forgiveness of sin, he had always taught that one must do good works and practice faith in them and thereby prove it. 

When the blessed D. Barns confessed his faith, one of them asked him what he thought Our Lady was and what he said about her. He answered that she was a pure virgin who had conceived and given birth to Jesus Christ. 

When he spoke, the judge, who was standing by the fire, ordered him to be silent and said, "Master Barns, speak no more. Then Barns answered and said, "Oh, my dear judge, hear me this time without anger; you will hear me no more. If | say anything that you do not want me to say, wave your hand at me and | will let it go. 

Immediately another of the servants came up and said, "Barns, what do you say about baptism and the sacrament of the altar? He answered: 

Of baptism | say that it is God's order, and is necessary for the salvation of souls, and called God to witness that he had never kept it with the Anabaptists, and was innocently declared to be an Anabaptist. 

Of the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, he gave this answer: "| have always taught, and still say, that through the holy and sacrificial power of the order, command, and word of Christ, the true body of Christ is miraculously formed, 


Letters from the year 1540. No. 2743. 





2547 


who was conceived and born of Mary the Virgin, if it is properly used according to the order of Christ. He called as a witness to these two pieces a man called Master Poppe, who was there and who had heard his teaching about them, since he had spoken and disputed against the Anabaptists. The same Poppe also testified to him at the fire there and said yes to it. 

The servant came out again and asked what he thought of the saints. He answered: 

Of the saints | say that all those are holy who believe the holy Scriptures and the promise of God, have kept the same truthfully, have followed the word of God, and in such faith have died to praise, honor, and glory of God, with greater and higher thanksgiving than my senses can comprehend and my tongue can utter. But whether they pray for us or not, we have no certain report from the Scriptures. If | had found it in the Scriptures, | would not have told you. There is no need to ask, argue or preach much about this, for there is nothing certain about it in Scripture. But this is certain and certain, that Jesus Christ died for us, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of God, and intercedes for us. 

But when he saw that he was burdened with unnecessary questions and that the end was near, he turned to prayer and spoke these words: 

O eternal, justifiable, blameless God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the divine Trinity, three Persons and One God, be merciful to me, a sinner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, your dear Son. 

O eternal, living God, | poor sinner humbly beg you, be merciful to me, O Lord, do not judge me, for | cannot stand before you. If | had nothing else to preserve me to salvation but my own righteousness, | would have to go to the devil. 

God has given me two commandments, neither of which | have fulfilled before God. One is that | should love God. The other is love, so that | may be obligated to my neighbor, of which two commandments | am obligated to keep and fulfill both the one and the other. 

With this he went to the judges and those who were in the king's court and spoke to them: 

| ask you to commend me to the Lord King, for whose welfare and long life | have prayed daily in the prison, and | also ask that God the Lord may preserve his life for a long time. 


2548 


| also ask that you tell him, first, that |, Barns, desire and ask of him by the name of Jesus Christ, that he maintain and continue the true Christian religion and the holy gospel as he began in his kingdom, and that he take diligent care that he not be drawn away from it by anyone's persuasion. 

Secondly, that His Majesty may have respect for the holy matrimony and may make an understanding that henceforth no one may be permitted to leave or cast out his wife without just cause and sufficient fault contrary to God's commandment; since at the present time some presume to leave their wives, either because they are enraged by them or because they otherwise have a displeasure with them, for Christ says: "What God has joined together, let not man put asunder." 

That also the marriage state would like to be freely admitted to those to whom God and His Word permits and releases it. 

Thirdly, tell him that | request from his royal majesty in the name of Jesus Christ that he will see to it that the damned swearing is forbidden and punished, for | have neither seen nor heard such swearing as is practiced in England all my life. Therefore | ask, Your Royal Majesty, to issue a decree. Therefore | ask your majesty to see to it, for God Almighty will punish it. And he addressed one of them and said: "Master Popp, | ask you to greet Master Erhard and to tell him that |, by the name of God, request of him that he cease his great swearing, or God will punish him and all the others. 

Fourthly, tell him: "After the Lord Christ and we 

poor, miserable, despised people, among whom | am one, have led him to the knowledge of the truth through our preaching, by which he has learned to recognize, reject and destroy the papal and monastic superstition and hypocrisy, and thus have made him from half a king to a whole, because he came to it through our preaching, to which neither he nor his father had never come. And he has received no small benefit, nor any common wealth from the devastation of the abbeys and other spiritual goods, but he has neglected to do anything that God has commanded him to do with these goods. When the blessed Doctor Barns continued to talk about this, he was told to be silent, but he said: "I do not want to say anything bad, but | ask that His Majesty would like to help the poor, needy people. Maj. would like to help the poor, needy people.

Do not forget to help them with the spiritual goods and jewels they have received. 

May Jesus Christ keep his graces and let him live long, even the young prince, his son. May the Lord Christ graciously preserve him, and grant that he may live long after his father, and give grace that he may complete in religion the thing which his father began, amen. 

When he had finished this speech, he began to speak to the judge and addressed him thus: Judge! Let me see the articles you have against me; let me hear them, that | may know the cause of my death. 

To this the judge answered: We in the court have no articles against you. To this said D. Antonius: Since you have no articles against me, then | can well think that | am condemned by the previous Acta and Sentention of the Parliament. And then he said: | am ready and willing to die. Lord Jesus, have mercy on me. 

He asked the people to pray for him while he was still alive, and no longer, because it would be too late. 

And said unto the judge, Judge, pray for me. As the saints pray for us, so will | pray for you. 

If | have ever offended anyone in my sermons or otherwise, | pray that they will forgive me. 

Again, if anyone interpreted my sermon differently from what | said and meant, | forgive him. 

If there is anyone who has heard my sermon and has doubts about it, let him come forward and | will tell him what | think and what | believe. 

But because no one brought anything forward, he continued, "Lord Jesus, have mercy on me and on all those who have condemned me unknowingly; | beseech you, my God, do not count it a sin to them. 

| also pray to you, my God, that you will make known their sin to those who have condemned me out of wickedness, that you will forgive them, and that you will grant them grace so that they may know the truth and what they have done and amend their ways. 

| also ask you to greet Stephen, the Bishop of Winchester, whom | forgive everything in which he may have offended me, as completely as | want God to forgive my sin. | cannot forgive as completely as God forgives, but | forgive him as clearly and completely as one man can forgive another.

Luther, Jonas and Bugenhagen to the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


Concerns about the position of the Elector regarding the election of the bishop of Naumburg and the Reformation of the Naumburg Abbey. 


The original in Bugenhagen's handwriting with original signatures is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. B, fol. 190. Printed in Burkhardt, p. 367. 


Most Serene, Highborn Prince! Ew. ch. G. our obedient, completely submissive, willing services are ready beforehand. Most gracious Prince and Lord! After the Bishop of Naumburg recently died according to the will of God, we have received from Doctor Briicken, E. ch. F. G. Rathe, the articles and partly received and read them in writings, therein E. ch. F. G. graciously requests our concern. Although we have not yet received full or complete reports on the occasion of this trade or on the diocese and monastery of Naumburg, we do not yet really know what E. ch. F. G. has to say about the law and the law of Naumburg. F. G. have for jus and justice to the diocese and monastery, however, so E. ch. F. G. report in the writings sent over next, that it is E. ch. F. G. to be authorized to do so, as the Electors and Princes of Saxony did in former times, that the canons without prior knowledge of E. ch. F. G. as the sovereign and patron prince, shall not elect any person as bishop whom E. ch. F. G., then in this matter, according to our simplicity, this is our submissive concern: First, where it is certain and can stand for a reason that E. ch. F. G. are authorized before age, the canons, if they are not rightly the Election 


1) this advice is brief, that E. ch. F. G. proceed and not allow the canons to make a papist election, but force them to elect a bishop who is able to exercise the episcopate in a Christian manner, as St. Paul writes in Tito and Timothy, who is also zealous for pure doctrine in the Confession and Apology, and in sum is not contrary to the Gospel and divine truth. In the event, even where E. ch. F. G. is certainly authorized to do so, E. ch. F.G. would have to keep the monastery and the churches free from papal idolatries and abominations, their ch. F. G. to reform them according to Christian conscience and by God's word. And truly, the canons are worthy, and with their defiance, their manifold blasphemies, and _ their Pharisaic bitterness and quarrels against the Gospel, they deserve such serious coercion. The poor subjects, so many souls, are groaning for salvation, and it would be necessary for the poor citizens to come to their aid and salvation through this occasion. On the other hand, if it is public, and we all know that the canons and priests are blinded and obdurate from time to time, they will whimsically seek evasion and a remedy, that they will not grant E. ch. F. G. such a thing. And in the event that E. ch. F. G. could not or would not base themselves on a jus brought here, the way to be taken would be that E. ch. F. G. should appoint a person who pleases E. ch. F. G. to be a prince, or as it would please E. ch. F. G. to petition the Chapter, and with such petition, which may be called preces potentes or armatae, therein E. ch. F. G. may note them seriously. F. G. seriously that E. ch. F. G. do not like the idolatry they have practiced, and that they intend to carry out reformation in the future, as E. ch. F. G. know how to do better than we can consider or indicate. If, however, the canons will not grant the gracious intercession, but continue with their electio as hardened, then it is to be advised that E. ch. F. G. expect another occasion through patience, which occasion God will give. For that E. ch.

F. G. should, in these dwindling times and tempers, when everything is almost carefree and dangerous, take the diocese and monastery in hand, in which the nobility is also secretly opposed to the princes, ona journey and undertake something by force, we would not in conscience be able to advise ourselves now, and there would also be a complaint against our consciences if we had given cause for such a journey. In the meantime it would be enough that by the word 1) and preaching ministry the souls of the sighing would be saved. Where one could also direct this trade with the election, so that it comes into a dilation, and the invasion of a papist bishop is thus prevented, until more convenient, absente Caesare, change and reformation can be made, should also be useful here. This is, most gracious Prince and Lord, our submissive concern, and E. ch. F. G. obedient, completely submissive, willing services, we are obliged and always completely willing. May the Lord Christ strengthen E. ch. F. G. by his grace at all times. Date. E.C.F.G. willing, Justus Jonas, D. Martinus Luther. Johannes Bugenhagen, Pomer, D.

To the highly famous man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, the extremely faithful archbishop of the churches of Meissen, his very dear brother. 

Grace and peace! That I, my dear Spalatin, have answered your so many letters somewhat late, is due to the fact that | thought you were vainly concerned that you might be rebuked. For although here in Wittenberg they have begun to establish a consistory, when it is completed it will not concern the visitators, but will have to do with matrimonial matters (which we neither want to nor can carry here any longer) and will serve to force the peasants into a certain order of discipline and that they pay their income to the pastors, which will perhaps here and there also concern the nobility and the authorities by reason of necessity. Furthermore, you know that you are exempt by a special privilege if (which | do not yet believe will happen) such a correction should take place. Therefore | ask you to dispense with this concern. For here we suspect or fear nothing less than that. Only this one thing | ask of you for the sake of our friendship, that you in no way think anything bad if | do not write as often as you would like. | know that you desire and want me to write in the friendliest spirit, but you know my constant business, which is uninterrupted and very great. Therefore, | ask you to memorize this rule: as often as | do not answer you, be quite sure that | consider that a letter is not necessary, but that you are worrying in vain, or asking for such things, which | have either already arranged and performed, or want to arrange as soon as possible. For when | have recognized that a letter is necessary, do not doubt that | will put everything aside rather than let you be in even a faintly suspected distress.

Say thanks to Messrs. Einsiedel (Heremitis) for their extremely benevolent attitude, for they are a rare and peculiar light in the very dense darkness of the nobility at this time.

Prince Joachim of Brandenburg to Luther. (Regest.) 


February 4, 1541. 


The Elector considers further settlement in the disputed religious matter, as happened at Worms, to be urgently necessary, and asks Luther to read the document compiled about it, which he communicates to him "confidentially", and to give a judgment on it. He asks him not to add glosses to the edict published by the emperor in Brabant, at least not yet. - The document sent by the Elector is the so-called "Regensburg Interim," St. Louis edition, vol. XVII, 581, no. 1369.

Luther's own handwritten original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 41. Printed in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 279. On the directory of D. Buceri, this is my discretion: Because they confess and admit the main things, such as justification, both forms, the abortion of the corner masses, the marriage of priests, and monasticism, it may well be called a comparison with us. For these are our main pieces, and has especially

the common people herewith enough besides the ordinary ceremonies, which are not cultus, of it otherwise and elsewhere. For these two things, justificatio and the sacrament, have hindered everything up to now, because the people do not ask anything about the marriage of priests and corner masses or what concerns the clergy. But the two new ceremonies with the daily parish mass without communicants and the public punishments may be left to the conscience of those who want to use them. The people can well do without them and be saved by Word and Sacrament without them, and are not obliged to accept the new way with them. So we cannot take it upon ourselves or our churches, nor confirm it. 

It would also be advisable for them that such new ways of parish masses and public punishments were not written down or sealed, but started beforehand by verbal command or permission, so that one tried beforehand how and whether it would be suitable or not. For there is a great difference between imagining something and putting it into effect. And it might happen that one would not find priests who wanted to say such mass, nor people who wanted to suffer such punishment. For essays are easy to make. But if there are not people who accept it or have the will to do so, the effort with seals and letters would be in vain, and the last would be worse than the first. [Afterwards it would have to be changed, heard with scorn and ridicule, that we had given things inconstantly and uncertainly, especially because such ceremonies, both now and before, have never been in use in such a way. Therefore, let them try it beforehand, but on their conscience, if it turns out to be right, it may be put in writing. 

For this is one of the graces of our confession, that it therefore tells how things went and stood in our church before and after, as if one were hearing a history and not an essay or commandment. And where it would have been before, before it was in the work, who knows when and how much of it would have come into the work? So they may also bring it into work beforehand (those who want it), and try how it will turn out, then write about it, set it and place it, but nevertheless let the glory go, that they have with us 





are compared, because the pope does not want to do anything about the matter, and they would be forced to advise themselves. For the comparison is not in the ceremonies, but in the substantials and main parts. 

But above all, the best advice would be to set up good preachers who would diligently bring such main points to the people. The ceremonies would have to follow this. Because if the man stands well, the dress also stands well. Otherwise, if the preachers and sermons are not appointed first, the ceremonies cannot be fruitful; the cornerstone must first be laid and then built upon.

He is with the priest in front of the castle at Eulenburg, which contains him with wife and children, burdensome enough, as E. C. F. G. may inquire about it with said priest.

Truly, most gracious lord, it is in vain that such means and comparisons are made. There is nowhere to go before the pope and his followers. God must be left to do with him as he has begun, for it is the unanimous opinion of all that they do not want to slacken anything, but to remain and preserve as they are and what they have. Moreover, there are many things in them that we will not and cannot raise among our own. The best thing would be to take pious, learned people and let them judge what and where God's word would be; certainly, that would be left first and foremost. If this were to happen, then God's kingdom and His righteousness would be sought first, and the rest would be postponed until God's word had taken root. Then one could also act differently from the other. Otherwise, if both are done at the same time, one will hinder the other. Such is my concern. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befehlt, Amen.

The Elector acknowledges receipt of Luther's letter, 1) according to which he wants Melanchthon and Cruciger to be spared the journey to the Regensburg Diet for the sake of the university, but still wishes them to make this journey (for political and religious reasons) and to arrive in Altenburg on March 16.

To Doct. Martin Luther. Johanns Friedrich, Churfiirst 2c. 

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have received your letter concerning the attendance at the above Imperial Diet, in addition to your concern as to why the also reverend, dear faithful, Magister Philippus Melanchthon and Doctor Creutzinger, should be spared such a journey or be spared it for a time, and read further contents, and note such your report from you to our gracious favor, can also consider the causes, so you in touched your writing, with ourselves of importance, that it would be useful, and for the sake of our university necessary and good, that said Mag. Philippus and Doct. 


1) This letter cannot be found (Burkhardt). 


Creutzinger remained at Wittenberg and would be spared with such a journey. 

But since you know that much is at stake in this Imperial Diet, and before that in matters of religion: if we should not attend the same in our own person, nor provide it with theologians, it might be suggested to us that we, with our Christian true religion, were shying away from coming to light, because the Emperor's Majesty would be there himself. Majesty would be there himself, to come to light. Therefore, we consider it necessary to send the aforementioned two persons, which you will undoubtedly put up with, and will graciously provide for them, they will keep to our previous letter for the sake of such a journey, and make sure that they will certainly arrive and arrive at Altenburg next Wednesday [March 16] in the evening, which you shall inform them of and report to them. 

Thus, we want to keep our university in gracious and diligent order no less than before, and we also want 2) with the grant of God Almighty, to stick to the once recognized truth and pure doctrine of the divine word, which by God's special providence and grace you brought to light against the papal idolatry, We will remain steadfast to our end, of the same opinion and mind as other members of our religion, and will also firmly stand beside us at the Imperial Diet for that which is for God's glory and the spreading of His holy Word. Which we, in our gracious opinion, do not wish to hold against you, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date Torgau, Sunday Reminiscere [March 3] Anno Dom, 1541.

The shock to my nerves has been followed by no small amount of pain, but | will not neglect my duty to send letters. | cannot yet write anything about the Diet other than the uncertain suspicions of some people, for the public deliberations have not yet begun, and | believe that the cause of the delay is not both that some princes are still expected, but that the very one whose voice is to precede the others, and, as Homer sayS: XXXXXXXX XXXXxx [the deliberations are to be held], is not yet ready. 

open], the council is lacking. The situation demands that the Turks, who are raging in Hungary, be opposed by an army, which does not challenge them by invoking a right, but rather with the sword, mage ferro, as Ennius says. And to a certain city, having recently taken it, they have inflicted an ignominious defeat; but in order that they may be opposed, the unity of the Germans is necessary, of which the Bavarian and Mezentius 1) think that it is to be established in such a way that first ours are exterminated. The emperor does not agree with them, but forbids to do violence to the fatherland, and he wishes to settle the disputes of the citizens in a friendly way, if he could be shown a way to do so. They say that the Worms formula is displeasing. For they admit that the opponents have used men who are neither skilled in investigating the truth, nor do they strive for common tranquility. Again, the Frankfurt formula is disputed, namely that people chosen according to the judgment of the emperor and the parties should talk amicably with each other, and that the deliberations should be brought to the emperor and the princes. One also tells of other wise men. But about the whole matter we will have more certain report a little later. If, as | hope, the agreement of our people will be firm, we shall have less difficulty. | do not doubt that the opinions and the will of the scholars agree with each other. The Macedonian 2) preachers also promise good things from their Lord. Nidamus told us yesterday that the Macedonian said on the journey here that he would neither leave the Confession nor suffer to be dragged away by the allies. We will certainly make an effort to keep the confession. And yet we will not forget this warning call (XXXXXXXXxX): Remember it,

that you must not trust too much (XXXxXXXX XXXXXXXxX), so that we will not be too compliant. But we want to ask God to guide these actions, which are full of dangers and persecutions, and to govern our minds for the glorification of the glory of the Gospel. Publicly, the emperor shows no hostility, as his modesty in the whole preparation is admirable, and his lucidity in answering. Yesterday the Macedonian was with him, not for a secret discussion, but which was conducted in the presence of many people. The emperor's courtiers were surprised at his joyful confidence (XXXXXXXxx). For the Macedonian had attacked Mezentius in a very sharp speech, and nothing else had been done there. There you have what at least now seemed to be most worth talking about the beginning of the Convention; God grant that it may be for the best. On the journey, D. Caspar preached several times in Bavarian cities before a large audience, and the innkeepers were especially friendly toward us out of love for the Gospel. For we only touched those cities that are subject to our Palatine and the sons of Ruprecht. Count Palatine Philip led the hitchhiker into his castle with his entire retinue and treated him kindly.

I did not want to come to you without a letter from me, so that you would know, for example through this testimony from my hand, that we are still alive; but today, since the sun was bright, the air quite spring- like, the earth lovelier than usual, | noticed that | am much better.

In the meantime, we ask the prince 3) to order music from a part of his salary. We do not yet know what will happen at the court. In the meantime, a letter from Bucer has reached us, written to you, which we have read: about the arrival of Cardinal Contarenus and other histories, which you have certainly heard from him yourself long ago. | wish these monsters luck for this contempt. May God add many thousands more to the revenge on the arsons and on all blasphemies, amen. Satan, however, has invented a new art to kill us: poison is mixed with wine. Plaster under the milk. Again, at Jena, twelve died from poisoned wine; but we attribute it to the wine itself, to excess. However, it is said that in Magdeburg and Nordhausen it was discovered that the milk offered for sale was poisoned. But Christ has put everything under his feet; as long as he wants and as much as he wants, we will suffer. Meanwhile we reign, and they perish; whether they will or not, they will let the earth be founded on his ground [Ps. 104:5], and the ground be prepared for the waters. But much less will they snatch the heavens from the Lord of heaven. But if He

Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Sir! To E. C. F.

Plétzka (Plotzig) 2c., and have nothing yet. But | want to show E. C. F. G. my thoughts. 

First of all, there is a priest at Barby (Barbey), Johann von Milckow, who will not be able to stay, and our priest, Dr. Pomer, has almost thought of accepting him as chaplain here. For the people of Brandenburg have forced us to accept one of his chaplains with a high request, except for two years. So the fourth one is also leaving. But as the one at Barby is worthless, and as he complains about his cause, he has taken the parish goods to the court, he may be directed to Gera. 

On the other hand, there is a schoolmaster in Altenburg, Andreas, who would be very capable if he wanted to do it, or if the parish in Gera were also so stately, because the market is sucking 4) the parish priests, who have to live full of string 5) up to the ridge in these dwindling times. 

Third, the priest of Prettin is also there, who could be transferred [there], where it would be better, because he is overloaded with children) but a fine man. 

Fourthly, so that | do not omit anything: if Gera were so Stately that it could hold a pious, learned doctor, or | would have to know how many it had, there is a man in Alsfeld 6) in Hesse, Doctor Thilomannus Schnabel, who recently wrote to me that he would like to be transferred (how old he is), because he sees that [it] goes for the Gospel in Hesse like Christ in Herod's house. He has been my schoolboy in Erfurt in the monastery and here in Wittenberg, and the first creature | have created, since one young doctor made another. But a very reasonable, conscripted man. But unfortunately | did not know that he would be left there by the landgrave. For he would have been more useful in a school in Marburg, otherwise | would have taken him out ten or more years ago. | thought he would be very well off. But he has been so meek for the sake of his dear fatherland.

To Martin Luther. 

God grant happiness and blessings! The public negotiations have begun. Emperor Carl has indicated that he will elect some princes and others to deliberate on the common concord. Our people have answered approvingly that they thought it would be a useful way to settle the disputes if the matters were first presented and the Worms negotiations were continued, and they have asked that they be continued.1) After that, if he would choose suitable people who, after seeing the result of the deliberation, should choose the right opinions, there would be no lack of ours in the performance of their duty. But they asked that those to be chosen be named to them. The other part of the princes answered after us. 2) They remain silent about the trial. They allow the emperor to elect, but in such a way that he first names those to be elected. The Bavarian William fights that the emperor should not order these negotiations about the doctrines. He even confesses that he will keep the holy water. So far, only this has been acted upon. Again, we await the Emperor's answer.3) Since we have given the Emperor the

| suspect that some of my words have been passed on to the Macedonian; therefore he has testified in many words that he will not separate his opinion from ours, not even from the Confession. The Margravian Elector is present, and has been amicably exempted and heard by the Emperor. Thus the beginning of these meetings is calmer and gentler than at a banquet. 

My right hand is causing me great pain. Now, finally, they judge that a dislocation has occurred. But public affairs trouble my mind more. Be well and happy. April 14. | wish your very honored wife good health, also your lovely children and the whole family. 


No. 2771. Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


Answer to No. 2767: The Elector sends Luther a copy of the! income list of the parish of Gera, so that he can negotiate further with Tilemann Schnabel. 


15 April 1541. 


The original concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. Ji, fol. 156b. D 4. 16 a. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 376. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have received your answer and concerns about transferring half of a pastor to Gerau, and after you have informed us, among others, about Doctor Tiloman Schnabel, who wanted to be transferred from Alsfeld (Alueld) in Hesse for several reasons, but you would first like to know whether the parish would also be so suitable, We will send you a copy of how the income, use and interest of the parish of Gerau has been determined in the visitation that has been held, and if there should be a lack of this, we will ensure that the people of Gerau will also show themselves with a considerable allowance. Therefore you will know how to give them your instructions on their request, as we therefore want to direct them further to you, and otherwise, for the aforementioned doctors' promotion. We are pleased with this, and we are graciously inclined to you. Given on Friday after Palmarum [April 15] Anno 1541. 


1) The copy of the income is missing from the acts (Burkhardt). 


Answer to No. 2768. Luther wishes that the negotiations progress well, but this can only happen if fervent prayers are made to God. He shares some news, but also refers to Amsdorf, who will come to Regensburg.

To Phil. Melanchthon, the messenger of the Son of God and the faithful. 


Grace and peace! We received your letter on Easter Day [April 17], in which you write that the. The deliberations of the Diet have begun, my dear Philip. May the Lord grant that they may progress happily. For what can we hope, who have so often been deceived and hindered, if the inexpressible groaning of the churches does not finally accomplish something. May the Lord who called you and sent you, whose messengers, disciples and martyrs you are in this holy cause, keep you and govern you blamelessly until the end, that you may bear much fruit. With these sighs we are with you and among you and in the midst of the wolves, and this our Lord, for whom this our desire stands, to him the sighing is not hidden, who knows what the Spirit asks for us, namely that the name, the kingdom and the work of God may be promoted forever. When this 2) is achieved, Christ will again take care of our bread, our guilt, our temptations, our troubles, as the Psalmist says [Ps. 40:18]: "The Lord takes care of me." 

| write less about our affairs because Amsdorf himself comes, although reluctantly, but not as full of the greatest hopes as the Margrave. A book 3) has been published under the name of Satan to Mezentius, who rebukes him, 


2) namely, the first three petitions, Christ will take care of the fulfillment of the last four petitions. - Since this is the meaning, a comma must be placed both before and after tentationibus.

The Emperor is so gracious at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg that it may break the hearts of the papists.

| have so often forgotten to warn you to beware of banquets. In the meantime, the atrocities of poisoners have become frequent here. In Erfurt, spices and spicy medicines mixed with poison have been discovered in trade. In Altenburg, 12 people took poison from spices at the same table and died; the same happened in Jena and elsewhere. The devil sends his poisoners. | wonder what it is with the great ones that they are not vigilant in the face of such great raging of Satan. Henceforth, nothing will be safe to buy or use. Yes, | will tell a story that Jakob Walch, the clerk of our court, told yesterday. In a certain town, | don't know which, two men came, apparently clergymen (religiosos), as if they were looking for the service of the words in our churches. Each of them had his little box, 1) which, as often as they went out, they ordered the innkeeper to keep most diligently. At last the innkeeper, moved by this excessive care, began to be curious (Sciturire) as to what was in these boxes, and after one after the other had been opened, he found that they were full of small hosts with which the laity communicated, And perhaps suspecting no evil, as if to mock their viaticum, he took one of them and mixed it with the food that was to be served to them at breakfast, in order to provoke laughter. But those died immediately at the table after they had enjoyed the food. This may be a fairy tale, but it is certain that poisoners roam about. Therefore, we are very concerned for you, but we comfort ourselves with the words [Ps. 91:11]: "He has commanded His angels over you," 2c., and He will do it [Matth. 10:26], "so that nothing is hidden that will not be revealed," as He did with Mezentius, the child of the devil.

Cruciger to Luther and Bugenhagen. 


Cruciger communicates the names of the persons proposed by the Emperor as negotiators. Of the articles to be discussed (which he appends in the postscript). About the improvement of Melanchthon's hand. About Duke Heinrich of Brunswick. 


A copy is found in Cod. Lips. ep. 12, and (of recent origin and erroneous) in Cod. Goth. 189, ep. 53. Printed in Corp. Ref, vol. IV, 182. 


To the highly famous and valuable men, Mr. Martin Luther and Mr. Johann  Bugenhagen, Pomeranian, doctors of theology, leaders of the church at Wittenberg, his exceedingly dear fathers, Caspar Cruciger wishes 

Hail! This convention has not yet given any events 

that are either significant enough to be written about, or by which we ourselves would be entertained, or in which you would be much interested to know. But nevertheless you have seen the beginnings of the public acts from the letters of Philip. The emperor requested that the princes and the other estates of the empire leave to him the selection of a few whom he would deem suitable to confer with each other about the disputed articles and to initiate ways of unification. Our people agreed that the Emperor should make the selection, because it seemed that nothing else could be obtained. After that, the other part also gave its consent, although some argued vehemently that nothing at all should be negotiated with us about entering into a union. Yesterday, the Emperor presented the names of those elected: D. Eck, Mr. Julius Pflug, Mr. Johann Gropper, Canon of Cologne; of ours: Mr. Philippus, Mart. Bucer, and Johann Pistorius [Becker], Hessian. 


2584 


Preachers.1) They have received orders from the Emperor personally today. The emperor has indicated that he will also add an arbitrator to preside over the discussion, but ours have asked that several be called in who will be present on both sides as listeners and witnesses. The Emperor has replied that he will consider it. One doubts very much that they will obtain this. The elected ones of the other party, separated from ours, have asked that the Emperor also decide on the order which he wants to be observed in the disputation on the articles. We have seen the note 2) in which a completely different order of the articles is set than in the Confession. In quite the wrong order they put the one that should have been the first in the last place, and the most hateful ones they list in the first line of battle. But it is enough in the day that the whole thing is carried on with deceit and trickery, and that some have been the artists of these counsels and actions, who have long before thus devised everything. And would God that certain people, who should do it least of all, were not silent participants! But we want to ask God to destroy all of Ahitophel's counsels, and to help and free us in these repercussions and dangers. This, we hope, he will do for the glory of his name and for the salvation of the churches, with which, as we know, you pray fervently every day. The Lord Philip, by God's grace, uses his right hand better day by day through the cure of a certain Burgundian surgeon who follows the court of the Emperor because of this one skill that he restores and heals dislocated limbs. The healing would have progressed even more, if it were not for the complaints and indignation about such unworthy and inconsistent actions in such great matters, in regard to which no one with understanding can have any good hope, but must realize that it is obvious that these consultations about the union will all soon fall apart as futile, and the conversation will be over. 


1) The names of these negotiators would be given in verses found in Cod. Galli|, p. 45b, and are printed in Corp. Ref., vol. IV, 197. We give here one of the three different redactions: 

You plow it, you harrow it, you dig it, you bake it, you mill it, you bake it The noble grain; and do these people, whose name means an actual word.

Your highly famous man, Mr. Justus Jonas, Doctor of Theology and extremely faithful messenger of Christ to Halle, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! The advice you seek 

about the restoration of the administration of the sacrament, my dear Jonas, you could better give yourself, seeing the customs of the people and the church before your eyes. | judge thus: it is not enough that the people are well instructed to receive communion, but that they must also be encouraged against a future prohibition of the tyrant, so that they then do not shamefully eat again what they have eaten [2 Petr. 2:22], and the last becomes worse than the first. When you have seen in them that they will be firm in their confession, you may continue with them in the name of the Lord to carry out as soon as possible what you have begun. For the sacrament does not belong to the bishop as his own property, nor even to the council, but to the congregation itself, which demands it, and which must not be denied what Christ has instituted for it and given it. Since you are now appointed by the congregation in the lawful calling of the Word, and since you are compelled to present and administer the Word to them, and much more to administer the Sacrament, especially to those who will go willingly, you will surely pass through the midst of it, saying: You do not order communion for the whole city of Halle, and you do not force that all should receive it, but at this time you are a debtor to the persons who desire it; the others are none of your business if they do not want it or want something else, you have administered your office according to time, place and persons. If someone else changes or does something else, he does it at his own risk. Only urge strongly that the word and the gift of God be free and not bound, and that neither the pope nor the emperor nor any creature have the right to forbid it in any place, Therefore, one must despise the threats, laws and commandments, as those of the devil himself, and obey God. He strengthen you and put the adversaries to shame, Amen. On the day of St. Marci [April 25] 1541. Martin Luther.

G. most sincerely, and is more than too much. | would have liked to see that the dear Lord Jesus would have taken me away with grace, for | am now of little use on earth. But the Pomeranian has prevented such a thing (in my opinion) with his intercession in the church, and [it] has become better, praise God. Truly, D. Curio and M.

Whether they do not remember how many years | have been dealing with them about this word: the body of Christ is sacramental in the bread, since this "sacramental" was suspicious to me, until they have openly and freely confessed to me that they were completely with me, namely, that the body of Christ is truly in the bread in a sacramental way, thatis, in an invisible way and for our use, by the way, it is the true body as it was born of the Virgin, as it was given for us 2c.

To the highly famous and valuable man, Mr. Martin Luther, Doctor of Theology, the restorer of the pure doctrine of the Gospel, his extremely dear father. 

Hail! Finally, six have been chosen to discuss the doctrine: Julius, Eck, Gropper of Cologne, Bucer, the pastor of Nidda and me. There are: the Count Palatine Friedrich, Granvella, the Count of Manderscheid, the Chancellor of the Elector Palatine, the Chancellor of the Duke of Saxony, Elector, the Chancellor of Hesse 1) and Jakob Sturm. We would already be relieved of all this arduousness if Eck fought in his usual manner, but either his colleagues or others temper his impetuosity. He does not argue about the article of justification, he only looks for loopholes in words. He is afraid to accept our formulas, and now we are arguing about his formula. Yesterday | had rejected their whole formula, but they improve it in such a way that they do not let us break the deal. Today, again, will be new disputes. Ask God to govern these extremely dangerous actions. If | had to answer privately for my part, | would speak my mind and not let myself be entangled in such ropes. Be well and happy. April 30.

Mr. Caspar Creuziger, Doctor of Theology. 

Grace and peace! | recognize from the 15 wrongly arranged articles, which you sent to me, my dear Doctor Caspar, what Satan is up to. But let him turn and turn again, let him be seven times a Vertumnus and Proteus, the truth holds him fast as one conquered and bound. Act you, because you are messengers of Christ. "It doesn't matter if they cover themselves up, cover up 1) or drive up, it's still the infernal devil and lying spirit." To D. Amsdorf you shall say that he should add to these articles the one about the conception of the holy virgin, the one about the rosaries and the golden chains of the doctors, the one about the censer and the holy water pot and about the trousers 2) of St. Francis, and he may request that these also be discussed. But still, who knows what God wants to do on the occasion of these exceedingly foolish articles, so | would like M. Philip to be moved all the more by this baseness. They ridicule GOD, who will mock His mockers quite gloriously. Amen. Therefore, be lively and make mockery of those who make mockery, and also these mockeries will result in great serious things. 

Today, quite good things have been said about the Emperor from a letter, if | am not mistaken, from your Prince of Anhalt to our Prince, 3) namely, that the Emperor has sent you, the Theo

Luther expresses his disapproval of the Regensburg Interim used as a basis for the negotiations.

2) Johann Mantel; immediately following "Peter" is Peter Hesse. 

3) M. Georg Schnell from Rothenburg an der Tauber was Luther's tutor. About him compare No. 1956, 2654, 2696, 2759. 

4) Here, we have the text published by Lindner in the Theol. Studien und Kritiken 1835, p. 83, from the copy in Cod. Dessav. A. we have adopted the reading given by Lindner in Cod: Satis malorum vidi, passus sum pessima. De Wette offers: Satis malorum feci, vidi pessima. 

5) In this determination of the time we followed Kdstlin, M. Luther (3.), Vol. Il, p. 681 ad p. 547, who rightly argues against the date given by De Wette: "March 16", that our letter should be set after April 27, since he reports that the Regensburg Interim had already been handed over by the Emperor to the collocutors, which had happened on the aforementioned day. 


Grace and peace! From your letters, my dear Philip, | see how much you hate these false corners, but God will also put an end to this challenge and put the liars to shame. | also hear that the Emperor has given you that book which the Marquis sent to me under the seal of secrecy, 6) in which everything that the papists have taught before is stripped of the false sense and adorned with a sorry sense. When this is done, then it is evident that their whole plot is set up to make up and keep all their idols. In this they are to be praised first in that they condemn themselves with their own mouths, confessing that these things were said in a harmful mind, which no doubt can later be brought back to the same mind with easy effort, if it ever happens otherwise, that they can be cleansed from the former, actual ungodly mind in the whole world. Then [they are to be praised in that] they confess that these things may be understood in a godly sense, that is, while they are very good, they are ambiguous and doubtful; since they are defended under these! names, they cannot be condemned more harshly. Why are doctrines upheld in the Church which, first of all, are neither commanded by God nor necessary, and secondly, where they are best, are by their nature ambiguous and dangerous, very bad and exceedingly damnable? The holy Scriptures, which are also commanded by God, are not ambiguous by their nature, but by the unworthiness of doubting, that is, of unstable and unbelieving people. But the Lord will be with you far from trampling under the feet of the raging devil. Since it is certain that their doctrines have been and still are abused and ungodly, to the infinite evil of souls, it is not to be suffered that they should now be adorned with a good understanding and a convenient interpretation, but rather, for the punishment of the authors of the offences and the lords of the inflicted evils, they should be abolished from the bottom up.

No. 2785. 


From the Schneeberg. May 9, 1541. 


Prince John Frederick to Luther and the other theologians. 


The Elector requested an expert opinion on the article of justification for the religious negotiations in Regensburg. - The envoys' report on this of May 5 (Corp. Ref., Vol. IV, 253) had arrived in Schneeberg on May 8, evening; on the 9th, the Elector dispatched this letter to the Wittenbergers by a messenger on horseback and received their answer (the second following number) on May 12, evening. According to this, the correction of the date of No. 2787. 


The original concept is in Cod. chart. Goth 1048, pag. 154. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 380. 

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear devotees! Letters arrived to us late in the night 3) from the von Anhalt and our councilors of Regensburg on Schneeberg, with a Latin and German list of what the councilors at Regensburg had put forward for discussion in matters of religion and especially of justification and necessity (note) for an article that would please the deputies of both parties until the approval of the Emperor's Majesty and the estates of both parts. Maj. also of the estates of both parties. And although we note from the further report of ours that furthermore little settlement is to be hoped for, as you will hear from the copy of our letters, we might well have suffered that ours of this part would not have consented to the article in question either 4). 


1) Instead of senesco, we have adopted sanesco. 2) See above. 

3) This is at night. 

4) Instead of: "with" we have assumed "nit". 





For in our opinion, there are two kinds of deceit and danger behind this: one, that because some of the scholastics used words in it, they would hardly refrain from drawing the whole article into a misunderstanding and into their opinion, even as if one had escaped from them, and [as if] so far this part had been erred from. The other, that we allow ourselves to be fooled into using so many circumlocutory words in the article unnecessarily, happens only to the exclusion of the words sola fide; and although in the end it is not disputed that some want to say that one is justified by faith alone, that it may happen: we see, however, that the latter point is set adversatively against the former, as the words indicate: qui autem 

dicunt, from which it can well be heard that those of the other part do not mean sola, but have challenged it, and since they toleratively let it happen in the first place, they have from the beginning had to hang on to the fact that the word sola does not remain sola, nor should it apply in style. For they want the aforementioned teachers to attach to it the doctrine of repentance, also of good works, which in our opinion is therefore attached by those of the other part in such a way that they want to attach to our confession a rag of shame, as if our part had gone too far with the word sola, and would now have to admit that works also belonged to justification, as they of the other part would not refrain from proclaiming this in the worst and most evil way, where the article should thus be approved. Therefore, we are not a little disconcerted by what those who have been ordered to do so by our means have done, 5) that they have allowed themselves to be placed in such a position with the others, yet your and Philippi's books, as well as all those who have taught and written on this subject up to now, admonish with proper measure and order about repentance and the judgment of God and about good works. Although our chancellor, Magister Franz, Doctor Bridges has written, when he reported to us, that the members of this section should have conditioned, where in the other disputed articles also no settlement is described, that the reported notel and article should be nothing, we still did not want to refrain from sending you the same _ position immediately, and to hear your report and concerns, also mind and will, and how the article pleases you and suffers (suffers) or not. For this reason, we have sent our messengers on horseback with this

You should also not let these things become known at Wittenberg or elsewhere at this time, for we are told that some spies are to be appointed there, who will tell Mainz and others of the opposing side against Regensburg how and what is being said about the action there, and also what Magister Philippus in particular is writing to you and others. And we would like the Rector and the University to issue a warning by public mandate that such people should not be allowed to stay there any longer, so that they do not suffer any inconvenience as a result. Thus, we order our bailiff or castle officer at Wittenberg to pay good attention to such suspicious spies and to take action against them, even if they want to consider themselves students. We did not want to restrain you in your gracious opinion, and do us a gracious favor, to which we are graciously inclined. Date on 3) Schneeberg, Monday after Jubilate [May 9] 1541.

and friends! Magister Johannes Kraft has enabled me to write this letter to your strictest and most honorable friends. After he received from you 20 fl. for the tax in his studio, now at six go, with such a duty that he should not go elsewhere without your leave, but should serve your city, of which he thanked you very much, and acknowledged it justly. Now, however, he has grown very well with such scholarship, and has become a fine, learned man, who is now to reach further into the higher faculty. But I, if his complexion were not too weak for preaching, would not like to see him outside of theology; for he is very well versed in the Scriptures, sedate and chaste, who should be a good man for me in the church. For this reason | advised him to the Medicina. Now you can think for yourselves, dear sirs, that nothing can be done in the high faculties with 20 fl. My amicable request is, therefore, that your strictest and most honorable ones improve his scholarship; if that is too difficult, then release him from the duty, so that he may meanwhile be content with other work or school service until he may come higher. May such my request be granted, and let the same M. Kraft enjoy comforting, because such charity is so very well invested; and yet otherwise such great good is invested badly in all the world. Your strict and honorable friends will know how to show themselves Christian and favorable. Herewith to the dear God, Amen. Monday after Jubilate [May 9] 1541. Martinus Luthrus, D.

To Martin Luther. 

Hail! The most noble prince has sent here your judgment on the formula in the matter of justification. If agreement were subsequently reached on the other articles, this formula could easily be improved. For it will again be submitted for deliberation, and among the princes everything is still undecided. | also disliked the word "active" (efficax) at this point 2). But it was a very violent dispute about many pieces, and Contarenus had sent a quite inconsistent formula, which was completely rejected. So, since | do not want to cite everything, this piece was left lying. Afterwards we have been put to the test much more violently about the [doctrine of the] church. It was asserted that legitimate conciliarities cannot err. The article has been set aside because | do not yield. This has been followed by a dispute over the enumeration of sins] in confession. They defend this, not because they disagree, but so that they do not lose the rule of confession. Yesterday | explained the reasons why we disapprove of the law on enumeration. Now we go to the rule of the pope, the invocation of the saints and the masses. Here, if | can, | will leave these disputes pending, and apologize to the Emperor. For the latter accuses me of having become harder because of your commandments and because of the admonition of the French king. This whole action here is done with extraordinary artifice. But because Emperor Carl still assures that he is striving for an improvement of the infirmities in the church, and insists that the trial not be broken off, | have not been able to wriggle out of it. What he will do | cannot guess, for he conceals his counsels extraordinarily; but those closest to him indicate that they are peaceful ones. It is said that he will resolve the disputes that cannot be settled, and some have better hopes than others. It is difficult to say anything with such a great diversity of opinions about his will. For me, this hiddenness also causes difficulty in negotiation. 

The army of King Ferdinand is besieging Buda. It is said that Turkish troops would be there to free Buda from the siege, but | believe that there is a greater silence about Hungarian affairs here than among you.

Our dear Lord Jesus Christ strengthen and comfort you in all your trials, as he promised. It is said, as Christ says: "If we were of the world, that is, of the devil, the world, that is, the devil, would love us. But because we are not full of the world, the world is hostile to us, so our flesh is weak. But Christ is the stronger above all things, and will not leave us at last, if we abide in him, and go not to them that curse and blaspheme him. May the same dear Lord be with you forever. Amen.

Handwritten in Aurifaber. From the original in Schutze, Vol. |, p. 146 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 359. 


Mr. Justus Jonas, Doctor of Sacred Theology. 

Grace and peace! First of all, | think | have easily obtained this from you, my dear Jonas, that you bear it with equanimity when | answer you either too slowly or too seldom. | certainly don't have such a solid health that | could read or talk for an hour safely and strenuously. | have already often failed to do so, since lam exceedingly eager to talk, write, and read anew; so great was the strength of the illness, whatever it may have been. And even now | do not hear completely, as before. God will do what is good. For the rest, thank God, | am quite well. 

Regarding the burgrave's feud 1) you yourself sufficiently indicate that it is written to you from the court. It is not doubtful that the prince will not sell anything, so great is the constancy, only that he will henceforth take nothing for himself in the rule of Halle that does not concern the burgrave's dower. For who should advise him to do so? since we teach that to each his own is due 2). And it is a great thing that the gates of hell are forced by this title and the shadow of the burgraviate alone to suffer you, Jonas, the enemy of Satan and the Cardinal, in their midst, for which thanks must be given to Christ, the Lord over all lords (Dominator). Therefore, you will tell those anxious people not to worry about the sale of this title; God, who calls to that which is not that it is [Rom. 4, 17.] will also call forth from this little title great things that are not that they are, making everything out of nothing. 


1) This refers to the burgraviate of Magdeburg and Halle, which had been given to the Dukes of Saxony by imperial enfeoffment ages ago. Duke Heinrich von Braunschweig, however, claimed in his Streitschrift Wider den Churflrsten (St. Louiser Ausg., Vol. XVII, 1287, § 152 ff.) that the enfeoffment was null and void, but the Archbishop of Mainz seems to have regarded the claims as well-founded, since he was intent on buying his rights from the Elector. 

2) Instead of sua suis we have assumed sua cuique.

The rest of what you demand, | would also have done of my own free will and with great pleasure, indeed | am compelled to do it out of a sense of duty, that | pray for the church in Halle, and also for Balthasar. May God make him alive, as we all desire. 

As a syndicus who is to be procured for you, Schneidewein seems to me to be appointed. For with regard to the others, | have neither hope nor desire. If Schneidewein, if he is appointed, should not come (which | do not believe), then | think of Doctor Rosenecker. But why do you, who are a lawyer, consult me in these matters? About the church at Seida (Zidoniensi) and the deacon at Herzberg hear this: Since the pastor at Seida must be removed, and the one at Herzberg seems too young to the commissioners, Pommer is inclined and inclined to call him here to Wittenberg to the office of a captain, if he wants, which, as it seems to me, is more honorable, and will be more of a disgrace to those people, to speak in a carnal way. Whatever may be, all desire that he be provided for in an honorable manner. Fare well in Christ, and be of good cheer. Greet, | pray thee, from me reverently the venerable gray hairs of the gray head of Doctor Middensis 1) and all that is covered by these godly hairs. Everything is well in your house. 

By the way, you should not expect such long and detailed letters or epistles. For tomorrow | shall set about overlooking the New Testament, since our masters of the printing press so command. Let no one therefore trouble me. | will bear the marks of our lords printers in my weakness. The Lord be with you, my dear Jonas, and greet all of ours in Christ. On the Sunday Vocem Jucunditatis 2) [May 22] Anno 1541.

Maj. and the Burgundians in an unseemly relationship, and against the great prince, our friendly dear brother-in-law, brother and neighbor, Mr. Christian of Denmark, King, by a Burgundian, 5) who would have intruded upon us: In all of which we, with the dear almighty God and the truth, can testify our innocence, and also well suffer that you, together with all Protestant religious comrades, potentates, chiefs and estates, have been informed of every past event and dealings between us and the two kingdoms (which were brought to you by our dear faithful, Balthasarn Funcken, who will report the] 6) contents of his instruction for legitimate reasons) had recently been 7) reported to you, without doubt, you and only you would, without being questioned, against such unfounded statements and murmurings, give us a Christian 8) pardon of our royal glimpses and innocence.

When we, from the time of our government on, have preached the Gospel in all transparency for the praise of God's holy Word, for the acceptance and increase of the Christian religious community, and for the prosperity, welfare, peace and unity of our kingdoms, we have had every unchristian superstition and all original church ceremonies abolished 5) according to your doctrine among all our subjects: Nevertheless, we did not enjoy this, especially [we] 6) have always been forgotten about our confidence in the religious community and unfortunately remained excluded through no fault of our own. And because in the meantime someone has not given us the opportunity to ask for it, we have had to remain patient and silent about this matter until the appropriate time. Although now our gracious request to be reported by you quite confidentially for the sake of the highly thought of religious fellowship conditions and the incorporated points, and what you in such a way first of all give to God, his holy word and teachings, we are not obliged to do so.

Kili to Windisch from Leisnig to Luther. 


Request for Luther's assistance in obtaining the scholarship promised to him. 


In the Weimar Archives, Reg. Mm, fol. 94. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 413. 


Hail! Since before Christmas, venerable Doctor, | had delivered a letter to your dignities 2) by which the council of my hometown recommended me to E. W., so that my studies would be approved both by your and by other learned men's [testimony] 3) at the most illustrious prince, the Duke of Saxony; 


1) This letter has only the date, and no year. Burkhardt, p. 413, has placed it, in our opinion incorrectly, in the year 1542, because the facts stated in No. 2753 and in this letter seem to us to be compatible only with the year 1541. Already around Martinmas [Nov. 11] 1540, the Leisniger had received the promise of a scholarship for Windisch from the Elector, under the condition that a good report be made for him by the members of the University of Wittenberg. Before Christmas 1540, Kilian delivered a letter to Luther, in which the council requested that Kilian be examined by him and other learned men and recommended to the Elector. This was done, and on February 20, 1541, Luther, Jonas, Bugenhagen, and Ammerbach made a favorable report of the examination to the Elector, who, through Caspar von Teutleben, promised a stipend of thirty gold florins annually, after he had seen letter No. 2753, that is, in February 1541. Luther placed this matter in the hands of D. Jonas, who left for Halle about April 1541, where he remained for several years. Furthermore, Kilian says in this letter that he had been here for one year on Michaelmas. - According to all this, can the letter be placed in the year 1542? 

2) Instead of: observantter t. we have assumed observantiae t{uae]]. 

3) We have added testimonio. 





if this happened, he [the Elector] promised, he would give me a scholarship: so E. W. handed this whole matter over to the respectable man and gentleman, Doctor Justus Jonas. After my studies were examined by him, although they are small 4) and meager, he issued me a very strong certificate, with signature of both your names and enclosed seals, then also of Doctor Johann Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, and my preceptor M. Veit Ammerbach, 5) who otherwise would have given me a special recommendation to the Prince. When the most illustrious prince saw this, he promised me thirty gold florins annually, as the letter of Doctor Caspar von Teutleben shows. But | do not know through what negligence it may have happened that | am not also listed among others who apply for this fief. For when | subsequently returned to Torgau to request a letter indicating where | should claim the money, | was unable to obtain any, while others had obtained it who had previously been promised nothing by the most illustrious prince, and more abundantly than | had. In the meantime, however, | have often sent letters to Doctor von Teutleben and spoken to him verbally, but | have been unable to obtain anything, except that | had to wait until here (as will be clear from this letter, which was written before the departure of Doctor Justus Jonas); this delay greatly annoyed D. J. Jonas. For the seventh time, therefore, | am now, on Friday [10. June], | returned to Torgau (I will say no more about the expenses that should have been spent elsewhere, and about the damage to our studies); Yesterday | spoke to Doctor von Teutleben before he traveled here with the most noble Prince, who said that | could not obtain anything now, but would have to wait until Michaelmas 6) (when that comes, | will have been here for a year), although 7) the most noble Prince had promised that | should not stay here longer than half a year at my father's and the Council's expense. In worries and uncertain what | should do, since the respectable Doctor Jonas is away from here, who has helped me a great deal in this matter, | thought that | would finally have to beg E. W. to plead my case with the most noble prince.

would like to act. For | have no money left with which | could pay my debts, nor are my parents of such a fortune that they could continue 1) to pay the costs for me, since they have already given about ten gold florins or more this time, then also the council is burdened to grant me something, which has given me five gold florins. The greatest pity, however, would be for me if | were forced either to sell my books or to leave here completely for other regions. But because, as is known, there were many so-called foundations (beneficia) of my father's town in the monastery of Buch, | would not doubt that E. W. could obtain something for me, if not in another way, with which | would like to preserve myself here until this time 2). Therefore, | ask and implore your godliness and righteousness, so that it may help miserable people, to come to my aid in this extreme need. For | know how much your reputation with the most illustrious prince is capable of, that | have no doubt that she can obtain this boon for me, or if it were something greater, for which, as | owe, | will give eternal thanks. Farewell. June 12. Kilian Windisch from Leisnig.

To Melanchthon. 


Luther expresses his displeasure with the emperor and the settlement negotiations at Regensburg and advises to break them off. 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 335. From the original in Schitze, vol. |, p. 148 and in De Wette, vol.V, p.369. 


Grace and peace! You have seen from the last letter what | also think of this Carl. | hope that you will be recalled by the prince, for that is what | have advised. May the will of the Lord be done; for whether we sing or lament, they do not dance, nor do they grieve. "The first wrath of the best." We have heard that the emperor was sprinkled with the accursed water by the Mainzer and communicated according to papist custom, and that nothing was lacking for Christ to be mocked and ridiculed, 


1) Instead of alterius we have assumed ulterius. 2) This will probably mean: until Michaelmas. 





not even the [Matth. 26, 49.]: "Hail, Rabbi," and [v. 68.]: "Prophesy to us, Christe." Yes, he kissed him. Be mindful and hasten to get out of this Sodom, the final wrath of GOD is coming upon them. With regard to us, this is my opinion: whatever may come, every fate must be overcome by forbearance, and | have no doubt that it can be overcome if we let uus be found in forbearance, for He has said [John 14:13.], "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will | do, that the Father may be honored in the Son." His cause, not ours, is acted upon; he will watch whether, if we fall, if he will, he will also fall; but, this is true and certain, that he will fall sooner than he should fall, 3) to the great and eternal misfortune of those people, but to our great and eternal salvation. Enough has been prayed for the emperor; if he does not want the blessing, he may suffer the curse. It cannot be the fault of the devil of Mainz alone, [it would not be so.] if he himself were not a loud hypocrite. So many complaints he has heard with a deaf ear, pretending that he goes there for the sake of religion, while he never intends to hear them [the complaints], just as if, for the sake of religion, he were not meanwhile also compelled to eat or to empty himself (cacare). How much more could he, setting aside the cause of religion, hear these complaints, indeed, while you argue uselessly and in vain, have long since settled them. It occurs to me how he acted; how he had made peace at the invasion of the Turks before Vienna, but which he broke soon after, and many other things. Meanwhile he devours Utrecht, Liége, 4) like Heinz, his comrade, Hildesheim. He will devour the whole Rhine with its bishoprics, just as his comrade devoured the whole of Saxony. But hereof orally. Break off as you can most conveniently. For | have seen nothing of the four compared articles, except the one about justification. 


3) A play on words: irruet-ruet. 

4) Trajectum, leodium. Cf. Tischreden, Cap. 27, 

§ 134. Rebenstock, vol. |, fol. 179b. De Wette has no comma between the two words and confesses his perplexity in a note. 


2612 


The only word | didn't dislike about the emperor was "non-binding, non-preemptive. Although they put it for their party, it will not be without use for us. If you cannot break off now, send Caspar [Cruciger] if you can. His wife has to take care of the house 1) and the buildings, not without harm, not to mention his other duties and work, which the church and the school have to do without in the meantime. The prince has ordered him to be dismissed if you agree; you have Mr. Amsdorf in his place, whom | believe will not be tormented to death by what upsets you, for we often remember him, since his character is well known to us. But the Lord will reward you 2) abundantly, because for his sake you endure so many punishments of the purgatory, not the papist, but the truly Christian, yes, the punishments of hell. Therefore, be strong and cheerful, and, if you can, ridicule the plots of Satan. For right fortitude has its task more in suffering than in action. GOD will put an end to these things as well. | pray and will pray, who am a very poor sinner, but yet do not despair. He will hear me at last, who listens to the inexpressible groaning of those of whom he knows that they do not groan for the sake of gold, honor and pleasure, but for his name, his kingdom and his glory. He be, yes, he is with you. Be at ease in him and return as soon as possible. For there you are wasting effort, time and money on the devil. Friday after Trinity [June 17] 1541.

The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. D, fol. 49. 42! (but without personal signatures). Printed by Burkhardt, p. 387. 


Most Serene, Highborn Elector! E. ch. G. are our subservient, completely willing services in constant diligence. Most gracious Lord! At the next scheduled day between the attorneys of our gracious Lord, Duke Philipsen of Brunswick, and Ernsten von Starschedel, 3) after none of the attorneys appeared (because perhaps E. churf. G.'s order did not include Doctor Melchiorn [Kling] nor Doctor Zochen), we could not have rejected von Starschedel any more effectively than by giving him a copy of the previous submission and setting a time for him to again object to his need. However, when von Starschedel sent us a sentence on the next Friday after Trinity [June 17], we had it handed over to Doctor Melchiorn, and as he departed from Regensburg today, according to his report, he sent such a sentence to our protonotary again with a boy, without any avoidance as to whether anything further should be submitted. And although we did not refrain from sending such sentence to Doctor Zochen in his residence, he did not want to accept it either, but indicated that his order did not extend further than to attend the next held court day. Since (When) he did not understand the order before such a day, he would not get involved in any laws. So that nevertheless now to highly thought of our gn. Lord, Duke Philipsen, nothing will be missed, so E. ch. G. we hereby send the copy of von Starschedel's sentence, in humble confidence that [E. ch. G.] will graciously decree how it is to be handled.

Luther comments on the princes' advertisement to him (No. 2796), is very indignant about the emperor, and hopes for an early end of the Diet. 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 351. From the original in Schitze, vol. I, p. 150 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 371. 


Grace and peace! | did not believe your letter, namely, that of those, the greatest (xxxx XXXXXXXXX),aS YOU write, Ge. sent would come to me, but they have come and received my answer with joy; they have added the brother [of Prince John of Anhalt] George, the provost.1) But it is certain that those neither understand the intention of those who sent them, nor my answer. For they assumed that | should approve the toleration in those ten articles from both sides. | hope that this poisonous plot of the Mainz Satan is destroyed. Our Elector was annoyed that they had attacked me alone, bypassing him. He hurried over together with Brick, and they shaped my answer in their own way by adding a few words. It is to be wondered at how suspicious he is of the proceedings of the entire imperial party: he hardly allows the justification to be presented in words other than those in the Confession, and it pleases me to hear this. 


1) The envoys were: Prince Johann von Anhalt, Matthias von Schulenburg and Alesius Scotus. 





stability. But you will see everything, or Scotus will report everything. | hope that you will return shortly. For you have been there in vain, and have had everything to do with these shameful people. The prince has given D. Caspar permission to return, if you wish; the end of this convention will be here, unless the Turk forces something else. The murderers will also cause greater unrest than before and more severe plagues. For 25 have been deputized anew against our prince, some of whom are imprisoned in Leuchtenburg Castle. They openly testify against the Mainzian monster, this ruin of Germany. If the emperor does not punish Heinzen and Mainzen seriously, it is possible that he, too, will become suspicious and lose obedience and reverence, that is, the rule over Germany. For what is his so atrocious and pernicious hypocrisy aiming at but the arousal of a revolt among the common people or an open war? For the people will finally not be able to stand this inactivity of the emperor and the princes in the face of such great misfortune. In fact, | have completely grown to hate the emperor, who, trusting in our praises and prayers, sins against us all the more cruelly. And | will, if | can, act against him as much as | have acted for him. For he pretends that he cannot take any matter in hand unless that of religion is settled first, - why does he not also let the Turk destroy everything first? Why does he not let the Turks destroy everything first? "I think the priests all want to be put to death,” without our wanting it, because the rumor breaks out that they are the authors and servants of the pope in carrying out arsons, after the Mainzer, their head, is lost. May the Lord grant that there will be no uproar, that the Macedonian will fulfill the other part of the Schmalkaldic dream, amen. Everything is well in your house. The son Philip has recently happily escaped Satan's persecutions, which you will hear orally. Other things, if there are any, you may have heard from others. Given on the day of the solar equinox [June 22] 1541. Your Martin Luther, D.

Grace and peace! | want to anticipate your letter, which | hope will come soon, or rather every hour, and predict to you what will be done at Regensburg, namely: that you have been summoned to the emperor and he has spoken to you that you should be mindful of what serves peace during the conversation. But you answered in Latin that you would do what you could, but that you were not up to such a great task. Eck, however, cried out in his usual manner: "Most gracious emperor, | will defend that our part is right, and that the pope is the head of the church. There you have the history that happened with you. From the last letter that Caspar wrote to M. George, | learned that you will fight with each other on the following day. | am glad that Mezentius 1) is in contempt.

Grace and peace! | beg you, my dear Philip, to keep your equanimity, because they write to me that you are struggling with | don't know what kind of temptations. You know that these servants of faithlessness and the devil can do nothing but what they do. Who are you to correct those whom God has abandoned as incorrigible people, yes, abandoned into a hardened mind? | am animated by great hope that it will happen that this dispute will glorify the Son of God, as He says John 11:4: "This sickness is not unto death,” and Paul [2 Cor. 12:9]: "My power,” that is, Christ's, "is mighty in the weak." Not alone does this impropriety torment thee, but almost enrages me; but let it go, that wnat GOD has decreed may come to pass - forsooth! 2) He himself has hungered exceedingly and very much for such a cunning, such a clever, such a wise, such a holy work, - and that in a short time, God willing. Therefore, do not fear and do not grieve with your own. They think they have laid ropes for you, but they themselves will fall into the same", as David teaches. 

Other things you may learn from the court, and faster than ours reaches you. We ask the prince to call you as soon as possible, and this we have done. 


2) The originally given reading is: ne ijpse egregie et luculenter esurivit operam etc.. which De Wette did not understand and changed into: ut jpsi egregie et luculenter esuriant, which seems to us to be quite inappropriate to the context. Luther says: "The treacheries and intrigues of the adversaries shall, according to God's counsel, serve that Christ may attain his glory, which hopefully will happen soon, for God desires most of all to do such a work, in which he will show himself more cunning and wise than they with all their snares. They will fall into the pit they have dug. The offense that De Wette took at the given reading is removed by resolving ne by nae. There are many analogies for this (except that it is so in Sallust), e.g. ve for vae; pene for paene 2c.

we did almost a fortnight before this letter, so that we wondered why you had not already returned here.

Be at ease and rejoice in him who overcame the world; since it is overcome, we have overcome, as he says [John 16:33], "Be of good cheer, | have overcome the world," because the prayer of the church and ours, which is the same, suffers with you, will reign with you.

| must also refrain from the necessary many times, Which are demanded of me from many and various places and causes. Therefore, according to your kindness, you will easily forgive my silence, my laziness and, if you want to call it that, also my negligence. 

About the harmony of Christ with Belial in Regensburg | hear nothing new; | have predicted that it will be such a harmony, because the wrath of God has come upon the papacy and the hour of its judgment is here. Therefore, no one will be able to help it, as Daniel prophesied. In our country, the raging lof the murderers does not cease, but rather increases. In Prussia 170 are imprisoned, in Pomerania not a few, more than 60, and there is a cry that these evils lare caused by the pope and the canons. It would be surprising if they did not bring misfortune upon themselves, in order to fulfill the old word: "One must strike the clergy to death (todt)." Praise be to God, who did not want us to stay longer in the company of those people, but brought us out in time from this Egypt and Sodom, which the Red Sea drowned with moisture, and the fire of heaven consumed with heat.

Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 394 and in Cod. Goth. 4 From the Wernsdorf Collection at Wittenberg in Schitze, Vol. |, p. 154 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 379. 

Your excellent man, Mr. Hieronymus Weller, Doctor of Theology, servant of Christ at Freiberg, his exceedingly dear brother in your Lord. 

Grace and peace! Concerning the question put to me, my dear Jerome, this is my opinion: in this matter one must follow clearly what is fair and good, that the preachers are free not to 1) communicate if they do not feel inclined; again, so that they do not make a law out of this freedom, they should sometimes communicate in order not to give the church any trouble. Thus, since both are done, there will be no offense on either side, in that the latter cannot demand that they communicate, and the latter cannot claim that freedom is a cloak of security and contempt. So much about public communion. For | know nothing of the private communion of your church. But | believe that this is understood in sucha way that he who performs a public service in the so- called mass should certainly communicate with it. For | have understood your question about the co- administering deacons. 

About your circumstances (statu) | grieve with you that a success is so difficult.

To the honorable, prudent gentlemen, mayor and council of the city of Gdrlitz, my favorable gentlemen and friends. 

G. u. F. im HErrn 2c. Honorable, careful, dear gentlemen! Andreas Hinderthir, your city child, has asked me to write to you and ask that you be helpful to him in his studio, since he is unable to complete it because of his poverty. Because you are well aware of how much it is needed 2) for people everywhere who are capable and useful for church office and other offices, | want to provide you with comforting hope, as they gladly help to promote God's honor and otherwise the worldly state's welfare and prosperity, as befits right Christians. Without my request, you will not only willingly provide help and taxation to this Andrew, but to many others as well, since God has given you the ability to do so easily. But because the good journeyman needs testimony, | give you to know that he is a very fine, skillful and industrious journeyman, that he has many honest people, both of the university and of the honorable council, all here witnesses, that you are well assured what you turn to him, that all this will be given to God for a pleasing sacrifice, who must (what his dear son tells us) have laborers in his harvest, which is now truly great, and the laborers few. If you know zero such things, your heart will well teach you to perform such good work with air and love. Hereby commanded to the dear God, Amen. Tuesday after Ulrici [July 5] 1541.

G. u. F. and my poor Pater noster. Most illustrious, highborn Prince, most gracious Lord! Now the Lection Magistri Fach 1) is vacant, which | have eight, will be sought by some; but there is a fine Magister, my costar now several years ago, a Saxon, from Holstein, is also called M. Johann's Saxon, who is now often passing over to lend both in election and lection, that | myself am surprised how it happens, so he is one of the oldest magisters, studied here at seventeen years, and has been magister for over ten years, feeds himself with boys, and some much younger ones are always preferred to him, that it seems to be a small honor for him, since he (that | know for sure) teaches both Latin and Greek, as well as Ebrew, gives nothing to anyone among them, is of an honorable, pious mind and quiet nature, that | must attribute his hindrance to misfortune, if it does not want to be Neidhard. | therefore humbly request that E. C. F. G. graciously lend him the lection of M. Fach and order it, or else, if some would seek it, postpone it until M. Philipp's journey home, from whom | may inquire what kind of resentment lies behind the fact that such a fine, industrious, pious journeyman is left behind so easily. E. C. F. G. would graciously show themselves in this. Hiemit dem lieben GOtte befohlen, Amen. Sunday after Kiliani [July 10] 1541.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! Your letter was presented to us today, in which you prescribed a master to us, who is to be a Holstein. Now we would have been graciously inclined to grant your request, since you have indicated the magister's skill, that he is very suitable for a lesson. We do not want to reproach you, however, that soon after Easter the university sent us a letter concerning a master, called Marcelli 2), who has now been reading for 40 fl. in the Pedagogy for several years, by virtue of our foundation, with the indication that he should also be skilful; for this reason they have asked that an allowance from the Blank Stipendio be paid to him, and especially until another lecture, which would have more, could be done. Thereupon we agreed, and ascribed to our university that 40 fl. of the said Blanken's benefice should be added to him for this year because of his special diligence, and if another lesson would be done, they should order it to him, because they praised his skill. Now, before the arrival of your letter, they have informed us and named the same Marcellum to the deceased Magister Fach Lection. Thereupon we write to them again that they should assign the same lesson to him. Since they also inform us that one of them, called Magister Paulus, should be assigned Marcelli's lesson in the Pedagogy, whom they praised very much, we indicate to the university that they should assign the same Paulo the mentioned lesson in the Pedagogy. But if a lecture in artibus is to be done more than once, which the Holsteiner is inclined to accept, then he shall be ordered to do the same before another. In our gracious opinion, we do not want to let this go unreported to you, and we are graciously inclined to do so. Date Torgau, Monday after Kiliani [July 11] 1541.

Des durchlauchtigsten, hochgebornen Fursten und Herrn, Herrn Johans Fridrichen 2c. 2c. We, Martin Luther, Johann Bugenhagen, Doctores of the Holy Scriptures, and the ordered Commissars of the Consistorii at Wittenberg, the subsequently mentioned matters of S. ch. G., offer you, the strict and firm Ernsten von Starschedel, together with the honorable and virtuous virgin Annen, your daughter, our friendly services and greetings beforehand, and hereby submit to your knowledge: Since there are misunderstandings and afflictions due to a marriage ceremony, which took place between your 2c. Prince and Lord, Ernsten, Duke of Brunswick, on the one hand, and you, Maiden Annen, on the other, should have taken place, because of which the also illustrious 2c. Philips, Duke of Brunswick, also our gracious, as the father, had a contradiction and declaration of his F. G. unwillingness legally brought before us on the appointed date by his F. G. attorneys, also you, the von Starschedel, have objected to it before us on another court day, which we have sent to the highly respected Duke. When, however, H. F. G. has further requested our most gracious 2c. Lord for further promotion of the matters and S. ch. G. has graciously ordered us to set and determine another legal day, then, by virtue of the order received before and now, we hereby appoint you von Starschedel, as father and daughter, all and each in particular, a final peremptory date and court day on Monday after Bartholomew [Aug. 29], to appear before us here in Wittenberg at an early hour of the day, sent to the most reverend of our gracious Lord. 


1) In this document the name "Stharstédel, Stahrstédel and Starstédel" is written. 








The court shall have the Duke of Philips and the Duke's attorneys file a complaint, petition, or search, which the Duke shall have made on the basis of the following opinion, put your answer and legal necessity from your mouth into the pen, and bring it to the court. For when, after his F. G. has had credible experience that you, father and daughter of Starschedel, let yourselves be heard and spread among the people, then S. F. G.'s son, our gracious lord, shall be allowed to take the decision. son, our gracious lord, Duke Ernst, have made a marriage vow to you, virgins of Anne, and have promised to marry each other, inasmuch as you, the von Starschedel, as the father, have had this clarified in your letter, so that you may reach our most gracious lord beforehand, and also in the next writing, which you have handed over to us in Wittenberg, then S. F. G. would have considered their marriage vows. F. G. would be anxious to carry out their contradiction against it, and that there could be no lasting, strong marriage agreement between F. G.'s son, Duke Ernsten, and you, the virgins Annen von Starschedel, even if the matters had in fact and in fact been according to your pretence, as F. G. did not believe. F. G. did not believe, because S. F. G. as the father did not consent to it, as such should be further suggested and brought forward by S. F. G. attorneys at the appointed date. And we hereby assure you, if you appear at the appointed court date or not, that nothing less will be done on the obedient part's request, as much as is in the right and due, according to which you are to abide.

to your letters. | have indeed hesitated, because | have no one through whom | can send letters to you; at last, even in contradiction with myself, | have understood myself to instruct your wife to deliver the letter to you. It pleases me that D. Kilian will be Syndicus at Halle. | have personally wished him the best of luck, as he is a man completely devoted to Christ and holy; he will promote your efforts much. Our Diaconus Andreas 1) is preparing his affairs, of which D. Kilian will report to you verbally. But hear what | have so often forgotten. There is at Hof ("City at Hof") a quite excellent man, Mr. Stephan Kastenbauer, 2) who was expelled from Augsburg some years ago either before, or after, or with Urban Rhegius on the orders of the Sacramentirans, a man (it would be too much of a wound if you did not know him) who is very learned and quite loud; | wanted you to talk about him. He has as a comrade an excellent learned and sincere man, who used to be (as they call it) a regular canon. Either of them is worthy of a profession, not merely to Halle. | will endeavor, if Halle is not able to do so, that the Luneburger even accept him in the place of Urban Rhegius, if this can otherwise be sustained by D. Pommer. 

You have more news than us in such an excellent place. But this | have wanted to write, perhaps even in vain, that the papists in the presence of the emperor have condemned that book, the supposed maker of concord, 3) with great vehemence, and are almost about to suspect that it was written by us, although we hate it worse than a dog and a snake. That quite wretched book, which has plagued this Reichstag for so many months, is finally trampled underfoot by our part, and torn to pieces by that part, regardless of the fact that Bucer has approved it quite extraordinarily, and

insisted with great impetuosity that it be accepted, also "Master Grickel" boasted out of hatred against us that no scripture is more useful for establishing unity. Thus, GOD powerfully disgraces the two hypocrites. Therefore you see how much the prayer of the church is able to do. For the emperor is deceived with this book and deceived in his hope; what he will do, time will bring to light. | know that we and ours were accused in the most hostile way before the emperor on the part of those who condemned the book, and in order to ruin that discussion 4). Among other main pieces of the most bitter accusations, this has been the most bitter, that "protesting estates" (you know, that's what they call us) are pulling the subjects of the Catholics, that is, the bad wolves (catholicorum, id est cacolicorum), 5) out of obedience (as the rebels), and sending them preachers, who would undertake to defend them against their rightful and proper authorities: Whether you, the people of Halle and our prince, are not on this charge, | leave to you to judge. Summa, they are very angry, spout frightening accusations against us, and seem to breathe out more fire than in hell. 


4) This happened either on July 4, when Eck sent his testimony against the Regensburg Interim to the assembly of princes (see St. Louis edition, vol. X VII, 756, no. 1397), or shortly before, as we see from Melanchthon's short history of the Regensburg Convention (Corp. Reg, Vol. IV,. 570 ff.), where he says (/. c. Col. 575): "Although so many other points of controversy had not been settled, the Emperor ordered that opinions about the book be expressed in the assembly of princes. Here the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm, brought forth from a writing a long accusation of those who had accepted the Augsburg Confession. Then he also completely rejected this book presented by the emperor. He judged that no improvement or moderation of any opinion, no mitigation of the papal laws was to be permitted; nothing was to be conceded to the opponents that deviated from the customary opinions or from the ceremonies of the other nations. This was the summa of the speech of Lord William, with which most of the bishops agreed. To reinforce this, Eck sent a short letter to the assembly of princes, in which he disapproved of the book and testified that it had never pleased him because it contained unbearable errors and did not follow in speech the manner of speech and custom of the theologians. 

5) We have assumed that also here, as in the letter to Wenc. Link of August 17: cacolycorum is to be read.

But thanks be to God, who through this agitation of the raging Satan makes us certain that he is to be cast out, as the Gospels testify that he was raging because he felt the power of the stronger one who came over him and cast him out.

Melanchthon's short history of the Regensburg Convention. 


We list this document here, although we do not consider it to be a letter from Melanchthon to Luther, because it is described as such in Corp. Vol. IV, 570, and in Burkhardt, p. 392 (ina regest). But Melanchthon himself, in a letter to Justus Jonas of July 23 (darnach our determination of time), calls it "a little story (Ki8torioluln), which contains the short epitome of the actions." In Manlius, farrago, p. 3, it has the superscription: Historial conventius Ratisbonensis, Anno 1541, mense Martio. In Peucer, Mel. select. epist., p. 55, it has the superscription: D. Marrtino| Luthero, but he also added: De conventu Ratisbonensi, Anno| 1541, ru6ii86 Murtio. That this document is not a letter to Luther, we have another strong testimony: Already on May 24, 1541, 


humbly inform E. C. F. G. that certainly one lesson is vacant, and as | have been reported, has long been vacant; also that one master provides both lessons, namely the Greek and Latin. This shall be done according to this good opinion (as | hear), that the same master does not take the pay of both lessons, but collects the pay of the one lesson for the benefit of the Fisco of the university. 

But be that as it may, there is certainly one lecture left, be it the Latin or the Greek. But what the reasons are that it cannot yet be given to this Magister Holstein, | do not know. For this reason, my humble request is that E. C. F. G. would earnestly order the university to remain at the foundation, and that E. C. F. G.'s next order is to have the single lection follow M. Holstein; for he and | also rely on E. C. F. G.'s next gracious letter. Hiemit dem lieben GOtte befohlen, Amen.

Printed by Burkhardt, p. 392. 

Worthy, dear devotee! We graciously inform you, and with sorrow, that it has been credibly written to us, and also otherwise reported, that the Turkish Emperor Vasa, with her warband, which he had sent and ordered beforehand for the purpose of disposing of the city of Ofen, has recently captured and slain King Ferdinand's warband, which he _ had manufactured in Hungary and in the aforementioned city of Ofen, up to the head, recently completely killed and slain up to the head, in addition to having captured and received all guns (except for a small number that had been on the water), which frightening capture caused a great flight, both old and young, to Austria, as can easily be observed. Above this, the Turkish emperor himself, with two sons and the whole force on his feet, shall be ready to follow later on Ofen, which city, as well as Pesth, has now been taken by the said Turkish army, so that he shall not be hindered in his advance, which is truly quite frightening, and also pathetic to hear, that the above-mentioned King Ferdinandi's army has again fallen into the hands of the Turks. Since this is the reason for the 


1) The copy, dated July 31 (after which the above time determination), orders that M. Sachse is to be employed for the Greek lesson. Because Franz Burckhart was a teacher of Greek at the same time as Melanchthon, but the latter later also administered this position and now had to give it up, M. Sachse was taken care of. (Burkhardt.) 





It is also highly to be feared that the Turkish Emperor will not be satisfied with Ofen and Pesth at first, after he has been seized with an excellent power, but will go further than Austria and Vienna, as he will be able to do ina dissolute manner, and from this not only the bordering countries, but also us and the whole of Christendom, before the German nation, great, lasting and irretrievable damage, harm and trouble, if not complete ruin, which the Almighty God will mercifully prevent, is to be suffered, and such the Turk's actions and intentions are a punishment and punishment from God for our sin and wickedness: We therefore request, with special gracious diligence, that you order the preachers of our Electorate of Saxony, in your superintendence, to exhort the people in all their sermons to pray with the utmost earnestness for the sake of the Turks’ imminent distress and tyrannical action, and to ask His omnipotence with all their hearts for a gracious averting, also to give and grant gracious victory and conquest to all those who fight and battle against the Turk, and that especially the people and each one of them be urged and reminded to renounce their sinful life and nature, and to look more to God and His Word. And if this happens, and if it is done with earnestness and diligence, we have no doubt that the Almighty God will graciously hear the pleading, calling and crying, as He has promised and promised to do, and will graciously turn away His wrath, even the Turk's plan, as His punishment and rod, as well as all other burdens. You will not fail to make the same exhortation to yourselves and to order the captains to do the same, and we will be graciously pleased to do so. Date.

About the care of M. Sachse, which does not yet want to progress, because the university wants to leave the Greek lection to M. Veit Winsheim, as the older master. Melanchthon does not want to give up the Greek lection, in order to do enough for the 100 FI. allotted to him by the Elector. Luther wished that the Elector would tell him clearly that he could take this allowance with a clear conscience, even though he would no longer have the Greek lection.

G. and Peace in Christ. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! It does not yet want to proceed with the unaccompanied lection, and the gentlemen of the university report to me that they would all rather let M. Veit Winsheim take the Greek lection, not that M. Holstein is too little for it, but that M. Veit has taken the same lection up to now, and is also older and has served the school most in the university next to M. Philipp. Which is now true, and M. Holstein does not desire the Greek lesson, nor M. Veit, as the parents, to be deprived of it, would probably have let him suffice with M. Fach's lesson, as | wrote for him for the first time. 1) But this is a bad thing, in which E. C. F. G. will soon meet. They tell me, however, that M. Philipps did not want to leave the Greek lection; for he is very meidsam 2) and wants to serve the university in such a way that the salary of the Greek lection should go to the university, and thus wants to save the salary, because E. C. F. G. has given him a hundred florins. 3) he is so holy and shameful in the foundation of N. that he does not want to take the same hundred fl. if he is not to be a Greek lecturer, so that E. C. F. G. and the university will not be burdened for his sake with the hundred fl, will not be burdened. 

So it is now up to E. C. F. G. to clarify and clearly state whether M. Philipps may take the added 100 fl. with a clear conscience, even if he no longer has the Greek lection, unhindered, whether he wants to read something else in Greek authors out of his own devotion, as he has done up to now. Methinks he has done enough up to now, now probably twenty years and beyond the greater

He has done so much work in the university or school that he would now like to take rest in part, so that, praise God, young masters could speak Greek, and his students could take care of the lessons. For E. C. F. G. himself knows well what a famulus communis he is in this school, that he is undoubtedly worthy of that which E. C. F. G. so graciously grants him, and Christianity knows how to thank him; the papists also now, praise God, fear him and his disciples more than anyone else among the scholars. E. C. F.

Our greetings to you. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have read your letter, again concerning the reassignment of M. Holstein with a lesson, and therefore order, on the report now made to us at the university, that Magister Winsheim should leave the Greek lesson, which he administered for Magister Philips, and that Magister Holstein should be assigned Winsheim's previous lesson in rhetorica, with further content, as you will learn from the enclosed copies. However, the fact that we did not grant Holstein such a lesson in rhetoric is due to the fact that [Marcellus] 5) the university soon prescribed him to us as an industrious and also skilled master, and finally nominated him for this purpose, in addition to the fact that he had already read for a time on our foundation in the Padagogio.

Our kind and willing service before. Venerable, respectable and highly honored, favorable lords and special good friends! After the Electors and Princes of Saxony, brothers, our most gracious and gracious lords, wrote to us and ordered us to hand over to you two lords fifty florins, which you are to send to three religious who have left their order and turned to Wittenberg to study there: accordingly, in obedience to our most gracious and gracious lords' order, we are sending you, Doctor Martina, 30 fl. to the two from Bamberg, and to you, Doctor Bridges, 20 FI. to the one coming from Worms to Wittenberg, with a friendly request that you send us, in case of an accidental message, confessions about the money shown to Wolfen Falckener in Altenburg, our assigned clerk, who has his residence there, so that we may present the same in our account to the appointed hearers. We wish to report this to you in good faith, and are quite willing and eager to serve you in a friendly manner. Date Altenburg, Sunday on the day Donati [Aug. 7] Anno 1541.

Therefore, we are sending you, Doctor Martins, the same ten guilders, with the request that you hold them in the hands of the above-mentioned Johann Mantel and, in addition to the above- mentioned confessions, also give us the following from him

To Georg Weil, valet. 


Luther said that he had little hope for a favorable outcome in a campaign against the Turks.

Grace and peace. My dear, good friend! 1) Although | have little hope of attacking the Turk, and would rather see him stay behind. For when one sets out to attack such a mighty enemy, it seems to me as if one wants to tempt God, as the Gospel says. That 100,000 are sent against 20,000, even 50,000, and yet we, laden with sins, unrepentant, especially the king and the papists, have our hands full of innocent blood, cannot be the people through whom God could or would do miracles or great things. Therefore, | say once again, | do not like to see good people sacrificed to the flesh bank in vain, as has happened several times so far. And all in all, | have neither heart nor hope, so that | cannot ask for victory against the Turk, but only so much that God would save those who are to be saved and help them. | would like Ferdinand to have better luck and a gracious God. But since you want to continue to help poor people, | hereby grant your request with my fortune, as you find here. Hiemit GOtt befehlt, Amen. Sunday after Laurentii [Aug. 14], Anno 1541.

Grace and peace in Christ! The one who hands you this letter is called Martin Weygher, 1) my dear Veit; he is of chivalrous status, a young man with a sincere heart and of extraordinary godliness towards Christ, which | can already testify to by the fact that | myself have often seen that he has suffered the most spiritual temptations from Satan. At the same time, he has been my table companion, as it were in your place, for more than just one year, so that he is completely known to me. Therefore, | wish very much that he be commanded to you and to others of ours. He needs no support, nor any other thing, only that he may be granted to enjoy your service and loyalty, if perhaps such a case should arise. He has been sent by his own to Ingolstadt, in order, as | believe, to lay himself on the study of law there, after the rumor has spread that the study of law is flourishing especially in Ingolstadt. If you now think that you owe something to love, also to our society and to your representation (for he was, as they say, a vicarius commensalis in your place), you will behave in such a way that he will know that this recommendation of mine has been of use to him. This much, | hope, you will allow me to dare upon your kindness, that | may send you a stranger with so great confidence.

no less tyrannical against the pastor than if a pastor wanted to impose someone on the congregation against its will. Therefore, the claims of both parties should be presented to the superiors. For if they wanted to impose on each other, according to the arbitrariness of the people or of the pastor, the one whom each of the two parties wanted, there would no longer be a congregation or an administration. Therefore they may agree with you or become bishops themselves, through themselves.

Now to serious matters. There is a citizen here, whom you may know, in your fishing suburb, Scherf, who, since he was ill one year ago and was asked by Frogs! was asked whether he realized that he had sinned against the ten commandments of God, he answered very modestly: he could not yet determine with certainty what he had transgressed against the other commandments, but he was certain that he had never sinned = anything against the first commandment, because he was not aware that he had ever been with those who worshipped foreign gods. You see now if there are not holy people in Wittenberg who have lived neither in the flesh nor in the world, but always among the angels. The catechism, which is drilled into the brain every day, has taught us that much! 

Among others: my table companions have raised a question, which is to be brought to you: whether God, the most bountiful steward, gives more milk annually than wine? | mean, more milk. You answer. Secondly, it is asked whether a barrel as wide, long and high as the distance between Wittenberg and Kemberg could hold the wine that the unintelligent, ignorant and foolish God spills, wastes and gives away in one year to the worst children of men, the exceedingly ungrateful crucifiers of His Son, as people like Henry [of Brunswick], like Albrecht [of Mainz], the popes, the Turks, while He gives water to His children? | write this so that you know that | am sufficient for your many letters with a short one.

Grace and peace. Gracious and Serene Princes! | have read with great pleasure and unbelievable joy the letters of E. F. G.. | have read with great pleasure and unbelievable joy the letters of E. F. G., from which | have recognized what a happy and correct foundation E. F. G. has laid, both in the sciences and in religion, and | give thanks to God, the Father of mercy, through Christ, his Son, that he has begun such a good and glorious work in such high persons, and | ask and implore that, for the sake of his great mercy, he may carry out his work to the end. And it is reasonable and necessary that we all pray this with all our hearts, since we know that E.F.G. is raised to administer the greatest and most dangerous affairs both in the community and in the church. It is Satan who will cause both reenactments and innumerable intrigues to E.F.G. at home and abroad, but especially at home through false and deceitful confidants and officials, as we read happened to David and any very good prince. Therefore also the poets have invented in fables that Atlas upholds the sky, and that Christophorus carries the burden of the whole world, since he carries the child Jesus. This also the father E. F. G. is no doubt not seldom forced to experience. Therefore, even if a good prince does not lack strength, intellect, wealth, good will, godliness and all virtues, fortunately also — spiritual wisdom, nevertheless the constant and humble prayer of all is necessary, that God may rule all this against the power of Satan and (as Matthew (Cap. 12, 20.) from Isaiah says) "execute judgment in victory". In Him may E. F. G. always be well, and they will let me be commanded in grace, Amen. My son will write at another time, because he could not do it so suddenly. Of course, | did not want to let the messenger go away empty-handed. On the sixth of September, Anno 1541, Martin Luther.

To Wenceslaus Link in Nuremberg. 


Luther consoled him because of the contempt for the Word of God that he had complained about in Nuremberg. 


Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 341. From the Kraft collection in Husum in Schitze, vol. |, p. 164 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 398. 


Grace and peace in Christ! | received your sad letter, my dear Wenceslaus, and | am very sorry that lat Nuremberg the word is so despised. But what is that to wonder, because the devil is the prince and god of the world, since God himself gives him this name? Therefore, if he did otherwise than you complain, he would not be the prince of the world. Only perhaps you believed that the church in Nuremberg was such that it was not a part of the world, or that the prince of the world was dead and crucified there. | strengthen my heart thus: the first 1) challenge of the church (from 








the beginning of the world) always comes from the tyrants who shed our blood. When the tyrants have almost reached their end, the challenge by heretics follows. After the violence, and when the heretics are to some extent subdued, the most harmful challenge follows in peace, namely the licentiousness and impunity in life, without law, without the word, since we are fed up and tired of the word, which is already no longer necessary, since the enemies are already defeated. Thus, man's worst enemies are his household members. These are the three temptations against the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. 

| have always thought that you would not be threatened by the pope and the tyrants, nor that we would be oppressed by a mint, Carlstadt and "rebaptizers", but ours with us will become suspicious to me as outstanding despisers, according to the common prophecy: After the Antichrist is revealed, there will be people who say: There is no God. We see this coming true today, since they do not even want to suffer the word of God, nor do they want to be a part Of it. 


1) Instead of primum we have assumed primam, referring to tentationem. 


2646 


because it cannot be taught without punishing the vices. | have often wondered why John the Baptist and Christ were not killed for the first table, but for the second, because the former had punished incest and the latter had punished avarice, while the apostles and then the martyrs were killed for the first table. Perhaps we too will suffer not because of the first table, which they want to confess with us, but because of the second, by which they do not want to be punished. But be strong and persevere against such words as "Pfaff" and the like. For these words are spoken by those who think that our words are words of men, by which they confess that they do not honor or care for either the first or the second tablet. But it will be exceedingly shameful for Nuremberg if the rumor and writings are spread that they consider the gospel which they have confessed 1) to be the word of men, although we have all destroyed the word of men with so many hard struggles. But if they take it for God's word, it is even more shameful that they deal with it, that they want to remove the ban, which is the word of God, and despise and hate the ministers of the word of God, and blaspheme God, whom they have confessed, so wickedly in his ministers "Pfaff". And this is what | wanted you preachers to consult with each other, and to tell Ebner and Baumgartner in their ears. | do not believe that the speeches of those people will last or penetrate, but that it is a challenge against the Holy Spirit, or the third challenge. Otherwise it would be the end of Nuremberg, because this would mean to grieve the Holy Spirit, and one would finally have to be anxious to leave this Babylon. [Jer. 51:9: "But we heal Babylon, and she will not be healed. So let her go." But | hope for better, if you first treat her with patience and gentle words, and remind her of the dangers. Now, if any help is needed on my part, | am ready to write to the Senate or to some others. Only may you not be consumed with worries,

and remember that the day has twelve hours. | do not yet believe that all the members of the Senate are such people. We hear a lot from the nobles here, too, but they do not have the power to do what they want everywhere. Although it is true that those who are in the world regiment have almost always been enemies of the church, as they will be, even if this commonwealth should be a hierarchy which, though it has many evil ones, has only a few good ones. It is the same in the household, because God has rejected the world and barely keeps the tenth leper; the rest is devoured by the prince of the world. It behooves us to suffer and worship this inscrutable counsel of God, not to inquire or become indignant. If Nuremberg does not want you, there will be a place where the Lord will provide for you; as much as | can, you will find me ready. Fare well, and henceforth think that the gates of hell, which have been overcome by the Word, must now also be overcome by prayer. Therefore, pray against these evils of ours, but that those who are conquered by prayer must finally also be conquered by the final transition (phase), that is, the transition from this misery into life, so that the Trinity may exist in all and in all, as it is said: "| am the Way, the Truth and the Life," Amen.

To Duke Moritz of Saxony. 

Request for the former Augustinian Lucas Pittig, who is now village sexton, and has received nothing back from the monastery of his contributed goods, for a one-time support au money. 


The original is in the possession of the pastor C. Fuchs in Hanau. Printed in the Hanauschen Magazin 1783, Vol. VI, Stick 34, p. 317 f.. (very inaccurate) and in Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 60f. 

To the noble, highborn prince and lord, Lord Moritz, Duke of Saxony, Landgrave in Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen, my gracious lord. 

G. and F. in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! There is a poor man, Lucas Pittig, now a poor village priest, about at Alten- 1) Dresden (dresen) in the Augustinian monastery, in his foolish youth he became a monk, and his paternal goodness took him to the monastery, almost at the time when the Gospel began. But when Duke George was very violent, as E. F. G. well know, he had to steal out secretly; but the field 2c. remained with the monastery. He now asks humbly, because he has not yet consulted with anyone else and suffers hardship, that E. F. G. show mercy, and see that he has been deceived and persuaded, and let a considerable tax from the monastery's property happen to him, to help his poor house. Since the F. F. G. understands that such a request would be reasonable, even without the need for such an alms in his poverty, the F. F. G. want to let him enjoy this intercession of mine. It is to be done for a temporal partition, 2) for a perpetual begging or interest, that | am eight, E. F. G. it is no trouble to do. Otherwise | would know how to spare E. F. G. with it. Therefore | pray all the better for him, because | know that F. F. G. has almost enough to do with lukewarm, large, wide, deep, high, eternal and daily heavy things. Hiemit GOtt befehlt. Amen.

Mr. Sebastian Heller, Doctor of both rights and Chancellor of Margrave George. God would have wished that your opinion, that of the noble Prince, the Margrave and yours, that troops should be sent to Hungary as soon as possible, would have been obeyed. For | have often been displeased with the procrastination of others. For God would have us be firm in true religion and compliant in political duties. These would be heroic deeds of David (Davidica). But they do not listen to us. Although the armor of the Turks is frightening, we should not lose heart. We want to do our duty in arms and in the government of the community, because God will surely preserve the remnants of the true church. Thus says the prophet: Be strong and do your duty, and God will help the good cause. Then | also remember that the fifth monarchy will not last. Therefore, although the barbarity of the Turk plucks us, | do not believe that he will oppress these nations by his rule.

In a marriage case, between Kunz Helbig and Elisabeth Hordorfs to Udestet on the one hand, and Facius Steinmetz to GroBenmollhausen on the other hand, Luther had written under a document sent to him: "Martinus Luther, D.: The first one shall keep the virgin, because she is an orphan and free; guardians do not find equal power to the parents over the children, but as long as the partner is of good standing and character. Now "almost year and day" the matter was legally negotiated, and five verdicts were issued, all of which awarded Elisabeth Hordorf to Facius Steinmetz. Luther had been deceived by false reports of Helwig and the Hordorfs. Therefore, they, the commission appointed by the Elector and the Duke of Saxony for this matrimonial matter, send Luther the originals of the judgments issued, and ask him for instruction on how they should further behave. - Luther answered on October 31.

We wanted to take the matrimonial matters from ourselves, because we could not wait for the official office; which therefore happened, and a new ecclesiasticum consistorium was established, to which we directed such disputes and matters. But this | do and must do, where | am asked secretly and particularly about the conscience, then | judge after the confession and report. If this matter has now come into the law, or is still coming, or will come, then it is no longer my office or command, because | neither want nor should pronounce a legal judgment, as little as | also want to interrogate the part. For, as | said, | cannot wait, | have enough to do with my conscience. If this Kunz has deceived me, and only asked for the conscience, which | can well respect, because | have forgotten, and well know that my way is to reject part and legal dealings from me, then he deserves good punishment; and if you continue to follow the law, | have nothing to do with it.

Torgau. November 9, 1541. 


Concerns about the Naumburg bishop election. 


This concern was raised by the Wittenberg theologians for the Elector at Torgau. Luther, who was not in Torgau, later wrote his judgment under it, which we reproduce here alone.

| like this way very much, where you only want to have one capable person. That is the point. Otherwise, it is as it has always been from the beginning, even in much smaller estates, where a bishop or pastor [had] a provost or steward, 1) or as St. Stephen had a deacon over the estates, as our caste chiefs still are.

G. u. F. Honorable, prudent, good friends!

Letters from the year 


To the worthy man, Mr. M. Anton Lauterbach, the extremely faithful bishop of the church at Pirna and inspector of the neighboring churches, his very dear brother in your Lord. 

Grace and peace! Since there was nothing | could have written, my dear Anton, | wanted to write just this, that | had nothing to write, rather than that | should not answer your letter. May God strengthen Prince Moritz 1) in right faith and salutary world regiment. Perhaps you have heard everything about the Turk. | have almost despaired of Germany, after she has excluded from her household gods those cruel Turks or true devils: avarice, usury, tyranny, discord and the whole puddle of disloyalty, wickedness and unworthiness among the nobility, in the courts, in the town halls, in cities, in villages, and above all, contempt for the word and an unheard-of ingratitude. Since these most cruel and ferocious Turks rule among us, what will only happiness do against those Turks of flesh and bone? May God have mercy on us and let His face shine upon us. For while we pray against the enemies, the Turks, it is to be feared that the Spirit may understand our prayers, as if they were prayed by us against the true Turks, without us meaning it, and thus hear us against us, yet at the same time for us. For | see this coming, if the tyranny of the Turk does not frighten and humiliate our nobles, that we will have to suffer them as crueler tyrants than the Turks are. For they are absolutely intent on putting ropes and chains on the hands of the princes and shackles on the citizens and peasants, but especially on the sciences and scholars. Thus they avenge the papal bondage by a new bondage of the peoples under the hand of the nobility. But enough of this. Greetings to you and your two females, my Kathe, and likewise to all of us, and let us pray with one another to the Lord, whether

Grace and peace! | have received two St. Martin's geese (martinicos), my dear Jonas, which are very fat, thoroughly fat and exceedingly fat, and we give you thanks. But what is it that you have such abundance? Do you have to hall banquets of the Aethiopians or tables of the sun god? But of these things at another time. 

| do not have the news about the Turks that you want. There was a tremendous rumor that the Emperor Carl had gained by force a port on the African coast called Species in the battle against Barbarossa, the pirate of the Turk. Soon another rumor followed (I fear that it is more reliable) that Andreas Doria had lost the Emperor's army by the power of Barbarossa. God have mercy on us. | fear that everything that is done against the Turk will be in vain, as long as we worship the cruel and true Turks who are kings among us, namely the avarice, the usury, the hopefulness, the appalling licentiousness in shameful deeds, the tyranny, disloyalty and wickedness of the noble powers (niphlim [Gen. 6, 4.]), then the utterly satanic contempt of the word, and the ingratitude, and the mockery of the blood shed for nils.

Ktine von Burau, 1) E. F. G. Unterthan, asked to write to E. F. G. and to ask him to come to an end in the matter of his daughter, weakened by Hieronymus Kuutzel. | have seen the farewell in which E. F. G. put him in the right. But, my dear gentlemen, E. F. G. knows that he can neither endure nor tolerate such law as a poor man, and such law, as has now become customary, with advocates, replicas, triplicates and again purification, is nothing other than an eternal strife and eternal injustice, that God will one day send both lawyers and judges to the devil, who suck the lot and fatten themselves with such jurisprudence. Thus the man sat under E. F. G. as well as his part under E. F. G.. They may well proceed de simplici and piano herein without all strepitu juris, which may apply where the parties are rich against each other,’ and do not have a certain unified lord. Otherwise, such extensive law is truly a tyranny for the poor, and the authorities themselves are guilty if they do not prevent it. Why do you princes and lords want to make lawyers emperors and set judges over your regiment, and you yourselves neither judge nor help, if you can? Then a principality would be nothing but a rent master who collects the interest and who scoops things from the lawyers of his own accord, to the detriment and ruin of the poor subjects. Please, therefore, let this and similar matters be heard, judged and decided by the subjects themselves, and do not throw them under the lawyers' practice, who neither respect nor seek an end to the matters, but take the money, and with their tongues, squeeze out both sack and bag from the poor. E. F. G. will graciously understand my opinion; because | am true to my sense, such legal drudgery cannot stand the length of it, or we will not understand each other properly. Laws are always right; lawyers and judges are seldom right. God is good, but the usurer was never good. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. Saturday after Catharine [Nov. 26] 1541. E. F.

Renewed intercession for his brother-in-law Hans von Bora that he be given the monastery administration either in Belgern or in Nimpschen.

God and peace in Christ and my poor pater noster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! After E. C. F. G. at my most humble request 1) gave my dear brother-in-law, Hans von Bora, a gracious letter to the sequestrators that they should, where a monastery office would be vacant or shortly, provide him with it on appointment: thus he traveled with such E. C. F. G. letter to the sequestrators. There Bernhard von Hirsfeld gave him this answer: he 


1) Burkhardt notes: The Electoral decree in consequence of this letter, dated: Torgau, Wednesday after Nicolai [Dec. 7] 1541, which was issued to the sequestrators, was to hand over to Hans von Bora the Brehna monastery, which was finished at Easter, since Belgern and Nimpschen were already assigned.

He does not know of any that are vacant now; however, the one in Belgern would be vacant next Philippi, and the one in Nimpschen after Michaelmas; if E. C. F. G. does not do anything special about this, and names the same sequestrators of one of them, and orders them to give it to the above-mentioned Hans von Bora, they will then obediently order it to be given to him. Therefore, both he and I, as before, humbly request that E. C. F. G. graciously order that Belgern or Nimptschen be given to him, as it is best for E. C. F. G. to do. Because E. C. F. G. have ll consider graciously that the length and delay on other future settlement of E. C. F. G. gracious delay would give birth to a disturbance (stehrung) and his being distress 2). E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously show themselves according to their comforting promise, so that | do not have to deny this intercession to my brother-in-law. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befehlt, Amen.

if you do not know it yet. The Emperor Carl landed on October 25 with his entire fleet on the coast of Africa near the city of Algiers/) others say Altair. But this is false and impossible, since Altair is not on the coast, but in the middle of the country, unless they are deceived by the homonymous name. Here one has met him with armed crew from the city. But Carl put them to flight with the bullets of heavy guns and surrounded the city with a siege army until the 28th day [of October], which is Simonis [and] Jude. On that day the sea began to rage and boil, and in its own way (that is, when evil spirits reign) to rage in such a way that almost the entire fleet was swallowed up and sunk, while the army and the emperor himself watched in vain on the shore and were unable to come to the rescue; indeed, 140 ships (of whatever kind and size they tend to be in a fleet) were sunk, with all the provisions, guns, weapons and everything that was on them, horses and men. The emperor was forced by lack of provisions to have 1000 horses slaughtered for subsistence. He fled away in the remaining ships and returned to Genoa with the soldiers. However, others write about Carl himself, that he returned to Genoa, but landed in a neighboring port, so that they have to suspect his own leadership. We expect more certain news daily.

For he for his own person is much too fearful to dare to light a straw to the poorest peasant if he did not know that high people stand by him. 4) And moreover, | have added that God Himself will avenge this in a short time. Has not the blood spilled at Eimbeck, Nordhausen and by other conflagrations, since the arsonists and bloodhounds looked on with glee, now forced Ferdinand to weep again, looking at himself and his own who are perishing, likewise also Carl, who at Regensburg despised the cries of the poor with a deaf ear and those who complained about the blood spilled by arsons, now to look at his ruined fleet? Perhaps this African Neptune has also avenged the cruelty against Ghent 5). What do you want? The kings think that they themselves are gods, and despise the true GOD, especially the one who is called Sheblimini (xxxxxx == Sit at my right hand [Ps. 110, 11]. For they want to be respected for conscientiously worshipping the God of majesty.

By the Grace of God, we Johans Friderich, Duke of Saxony 2c., hereby declare and confess for ourselves and our heirs against all men, that after we have given the venerable and reverend, our dear devotee, Ern Martin Luther, Doctor of the Holy Scriptures, and his children, for many reasons, which we consider unnecessary to relate, we have therefore, out of our own motive and gracious mind, graciously agreed to give him, his children and their heirs, one thousand guilders of our princely coin from our pension chamber and to let it follow, 2) Doctor Martin such thousand florins during his lifetime, which the Almighty wills to grant him for a long time, with fifty florins annually, for two terms, as Walpurgis and Michaelmas, from our pension chamber in the two markets of Leipzig, to be used as a daily penny, shall bear interest, and be given to him or his brothers and their heirs after his death, each time against due confession, at his or his commander's request. 

However, we hereby reserve the right for ourselves and our heirs, if the said Doctor Martin should pass away by death, which the Almighty will long prevent, to redeem to his children or their heirs such fifty guilders of annual interest with a thousand guilders principal sum at our and our heirs' opportunity, 3) that we or our heirs, against payment of the principal sum notified in advance, are to be handed over this prescription of ours again, and thereupon we order our present and future rentmaster, rent and chamber clerks to comply with such prescription of ours in such a manner; This is our opinion. In witness whereof we have hereunto sealed this letter with our seal annexed hereto, and have hereunto set our seal at Lochau, Monday after Christ's Day [Dec. 26] after the birth of Christ our Lord, 1542 [that is 1541].

My dear master of the tools! You know that you are forbidden by my most gracious lord not to build near me or to my harm. So | have agreed to serve M. G. H. by burying the lower chamber. Now you proceed out of your own thirst and iniquity, and also fill up the middle chamber up to the grating, which the devil has undoubtedly commanded you to do, because it is done by the order of my most gracious lord and with my permission. From this everyone sees and publicly writes that you were not concerned about the building, but about the hall, to force me away from it, and to trample princely letters and seals in the dirt. 

Accordingly, it is my will (for | do not want to ask you as my and God's, perhaps also my most gracious Lord's, secret enemy) that soon after this writing (so that you are not unwarned) you should again take away the same debris from the other chamber, for | do not want to suffer the same there, so you have to direct yourselves accordingly. 

Likewise, | will have my bridal gate, which you would have liked to ruin with stones to my annoyance, repaired by you, and | want to be assured that the rubble will not knock down the wall of the garden. Also the earthen wall at the back of the new house, which will not stand for long, tinned, 2) so that it does not collapse the same house for me. 

If you will not do this, yet | know that my most gracious lord is not willing to harm me a farthing, but much more. 


1) Burkhardt places the letter in this time according to the building acts of the Ernestine general archive, Reg. S. - Von der Grtine had planned a large wall construction, which damaged Luther's house by filling. Exactly, the time of writing cannot be determined. 

2) "verzaunen" put by us instead of: "verzatibern". The sense cannot be doubtful: provided with a protective weir, either of wood or masonry. 


| will not let you, as an ungodly servant, take away what a Christian prince has given me, sealed, and attested, or | will report all this to my most gracious lord, and find out at least whether you are the newborn man who may impress his seals on a laudable Christian Elector of Saxony, since you of the nobility press their seals, 3) who do not keep letters and seals for you. 

For you shall be sure that | do not want to clear a hair's breadth more to hasty cursed ban, so that you clear my most gracious lord his bag. | will keep silent what great lords you have pulled over my neck, the dyke servants, 4) who practice the Fensterauswerfeu and Muthwillens geling for me. | will not blame you for this and think that you cannot prevent it, and you should also be innocent with me, although it is nevertheless annoying to suffer. 

Herewith commanded to God, who converts you and makes you different. For in this way you shall not be led out or even recently be in the abyss of hell. | would not like to grant you that, otherwise | would have sent such a letter to you. But so that | may be excused before God, and you must bear your sin and wickedness yourselves, you shall be warned herewith. There have been many and greater tyrants and devils than you and the castle, but they are all gone and have had to leave the sun in the sky.

To the noble, well-born Lord, Lord Albrecht, Count and Lord of Mansfeld, my gracious and beloved sovereign. 

Grace and peace in the Lord, and my poor pater noster. Gracious Lord! | sincerely pray that Your Grace will hear this writing of mine in a Christian and gracious manner. You know, Your Grace, how |ama child of the Mansfeld dominion and have naturally loved my fatherland until now, just as all pagan books say that every child naturally loves its fatherland. has done many praiseworthy deeds in the beginning of the Gospel, has finely appointed the churches and preachers’ chairs, as well as the schools, for God's praise and honor, and in the peasants’ upheaval, God has used them splendidly and magnificently, so that for these and other reasons | cannot easily forget God or leave him out of my care and prayer. But it seems to me, especially through much chattering and complaining, that E. G. should fall away from the previous beginning and become much different, which (as | think E. G. will believe) would be a great heartache for E. G.'s person. For now people will talk against the Christian faith, which | myself have often heard: What gospel? If it is provided, 1) then it must come to pass; let us do what we do; if we are to be blessed, we shall be blessed 2c. Such is now to be called great prudence and wisdom, although we theologians before or God Himself also know such; and where E. G. is stuck in these thoughts or challenges, | would be heartily sorry, for | am also stuck in them, and where Doct. Staupitz or rather God through Doct. Staupitz, | would have drowned inside and long since been in hell. For such devilish thoughts, where they are stupid hearts, finally make people desperate, who despair of God's grace, or if they are bold and courageous, they become God's despisers and 


|) "provided" == predestined, predetermined. 


Enemies, say: Let me go, | will do what | want, but it is lost! 

But how | would like to speak orally with E.G., because | am extremely sorry for E.G.'s_ soul, because | do not respect E.G. as much as the damned Heinzen and Meinzen, and yet it is not so easy to speak with the pen. But to write briefly about it, G. H., it is the truth, what God decided, that must certainly happen, otherwise he would be a liar in his promise, on which we must put our faith, or shamefully lack; that is impossible. But here we must nevertheless keep the great difference, namely, what God has revealed to us, promised or commanded, that we should believe, and judge ourselves according to it, so that he will not lie. But what he has not revealed or promised to us we should not know, much less judge by it; and he who wants to trouble himself much with it tempts God by abandoning what he is commanded to know and do, and deals with what he is not commanded to know and do. From this must come people who do not ask anything about God's word or sacrament, who go into wild life, mammon, tyranny and all kinds of desolate life. For they can have no faith, hope, or love for God or man before such thoughts, but they despise him, because they should not know what he secretly intends, when he reveals himself so abundantly in everything that is useful and blessed to them, from which they turn away wantonly. No man can afford that his servant would not sooner perform his commanded office, if he knew beforehand all the secret thoughts of his lord concerning all his goods. And God should not have the same power to know something secret about what he commands us? E. G. think, where one should judge oneself according to such thoughts of the secret courts of God: why does he let his son become man, why does he establish father and motherhood, why does he order worldly law and authority? What is their right? 2) If it is to happen, it will happen without all this. What then shall baptism, the holy scriptures and all creatures mean to us? If he wants to do it, he can do it. 


2) "their" put by us instead of: "ehr".

Christ asked whether he would now establish Israel's kingdom, he says, "It behooves you not to know the time or hour which my Father hath reserved for him; but go ye, and be my witnesses." 2c. As if he should say, Let my Father and me take care of what is to be done; you go, and do what | command you. Therefore, | sincerely pray to them that they will not withdraw from Word and Sacrament; for the devil is an evil spirit, E. G. is far too cunning, as well as all the saints, but remain silent to all men, as | also well know, because | hardly miss a day; for man grows cold, and the longer the more; and even if there were no more fear, that would be enough that the devil must nevertheless depart at the same hour, and give the heart a heat. 1) Thus, the GODs themselves feel well, how they are ready to get cold and mammon, intending to become very rich, also, as the complaints go, to press the subjects too hard and too sharply, to bring them from their hereditary fires and goods, and 


the kingdom of France, which before times was a golden, glorious kingdom, is now so nothing neither in goods nor people, that it has become a tinny kingdom out of the golden kingdom, and now calls the Turk as a friend, which before the Christian kingdom was famous. This is what happens when one despises God and His word. 

This | write, as | think, to E. G. for the last time, because the grave is now closer to me than one might think; and | ask, as before, that E. G. would deal more gently and graciously with E. G.'s subjects, let them remain, so E. G. will also remain through God's blessing, both here and there. Otherwise they will lose both, and go like the fable of Aesopi says about the one who cut open the goose that laid him a golden egg every day, thus losing the golden egg with goose and ovary; and like the dog in Aesopo, who lost the piece of meat in the water, because he snatched at the pretense. For it is certainly true that he who wants to have too much gets what is most wavy, of which Solomon writes much in Proverbs.

Intercession for a Mansfeld man who was oppressed by Count Albrecht, with expressions of displeasure at the arrogance of the nobility. 


From the original in the Gézische Sammlung at Hamburg in Schitze, Vol. I, p. 402; in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 416 and in the Erlangen edition, Vol. 55, p. 339. A copy in the Weimar archives, Reg. N, 41. 15a, has as date March 13 (so Bnrkhardt, p. 402, without specifying the year), which could only be correct on the condition that this letter did not belong to the year 1541, but toa later year, since Duke Heinrich did not die until Aug. 18, 1541, but this letter speaks of "E. F. G. Vater seliger, Herzog Heinrich". 

Grace and peace in Christ. Most reverend Prince, most gracious Sir! | am very reluctant to burden E. F. G. with my letter, especially now, when there is enough unpleasantness in the regiment; but necessity is necessity. Your honor may well know how your father, Duke Heinrich, had to interpose himself as a sovereign between Count Albrechten of Mansfeld and Wilhelm and be their patron; for | have to write this with great sorrow in my heart, that the said count, whom | had been particularly fond of up to now and who | considered a gracious lord, has shown himself so quick and hard against his subjects that they had to lament and cry out. One of them is also this good man Barthel Drachstedt, citizen of Eisleben, who asks, and | beside him, humbly, E. F. G. would have him graciously commanded, and as the sovereign prescribe against Count Albrechten, that he act more graciously and more gently with such pious, faithful subjects; for itis the nobility and secular rulers set by God to protect the pious and punish the wicked, Rom. 13. Should it now come to pass that the rulers Tyran 


If the nobility wanted to be like dogs and swine and deal with people as some do, it would be a terrible sign of divine wrath against the nobility, as if he had already deprived them not only of the Christian understanding, which teaches us to honor all devout Christians among themselves, as those who have been ennobled with the blood of Christ to the eternal kingdom, whereas this temporal nobility is nothing compared to this miserable worldly kingdom, but also of the natural sense, that they do not think about how all men are born in the same bad state, that is, in the state and deeds of sin, and there is no difference, and yet, as if they were better before God, which is not true, they act as if God had created them alone as men and they had to be alone; that these heavy thoughts often occur to me, where the nobility wants to continue in this way, then it is done for Germany, and would soon be worse, neither the Spaniards nor the Turks; but the bath will go out on them. For this reason, | ask E. F. G., who is still a young prince and can learn God's word and work in time, to beware of such tyrannical and stingy advice, and especially to graciously grant me this request. | will also write to M. G. H. Count Albrechten, 1) as God wills. If it is ungracious, then God is all the more gracious, on whom | rely and to whom | command E. F. G. with right prayer and fidelity, Amen. M.L., D.

To M. Franz GroB, 1) pastor at Mittweida. 


It is asked whether it is right and true to say that Christ also died according to the Godhead. The Godhead is not subject to death and no suffering affects it, since Peter says: Christ was delivered to death according to the flesh, but made alive according to the Spirit. | answer: All godly and true Christians, or the whole true general church of Christ, believes without a doubt the "holy Christian faith" (Symbolum), namely that Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, of the same essence and divine nature with the Father, was in truth conceived, born, suffered, was crucified, died and was buried. Therefore, it believes that not only the human nature, but also the divine nature, or the true God, suffered and died for us. And although dying is something foreign to the divine nature, it happens because the divine nature has attracted the human nature in such a way that these two natures are inseparably united, so that Christ is One Person, God and man, that everything that happens, happens to God and to man, 

1) According to the album Acad. Viteb. p. 132, Franz GroB from 


Oschatz was immatriculated on Nov. 2, 1528. He was a tutor for Luther. 





that these two natures in Christ share their characteristics (idiomata) with each other, that is, what is proper to one nature is also shared with the other because of their inseparable connection; as, being born, suffering, dying 2c. are characteristics or peculiarities (oroprietates) of human nature, which the divine nature also shares because of the inseparable connection that can only be grasped by faith. Therefore, not only man, but also God is conceived, born of the Virgin Mary, suffers, dies, as Paul testifies Rom. 1,3.: "The Son of God is born of the seed of David, according to the flesh." "According to the flesh," he says, because Christ took on human nature from the seed of David. Therefore, "to be born" is actually said of human nature, but because this nature is so completely united in One Person with the divine nature that it communicates its characteristic, namely, to be born of human nature and to become man, in truth to the nature of GOD, as John [Cap. 1, 14.] says: "The Word became flesh", God is born man, so that not only man is born, but also the Son of God (as Paul says), or in fact God is born, and the Virgin Mary is not only the mother of man, but also the true mother of God, which Gabriel Luc. 1, 31. f. testifies: "Thou shalt bear," he says, "a son, who shall be called the Son of GOD," and he adds [v. 32.]: "GOD the LORD shall give him the stnhl of David." Behold, one and the same is truly the Son of GOD and the Son of David. Mary, therefore, in truth gave birth to the true Son of GOD, and the same is also the true Son of David. 

Furthermore, what is said and proven about the bestowal of one quality, namely that being born belongs to the divine nature by bestowal, the same must be understood about the bestowal of the other qualities: as, dying belongs to the human nature, and yet the divine nature also endures this death according to the words Rom. 8, 29: "We must become like the image of the Son of God. 


2) Instead of ideo we have assumed /dem. 


2686 


The same in the [First] Epistle to the Corinthians [Cap. 2, 8]: "If they had known the [secret, hidden wisdom of God], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory"; likewise in the Epistle to the Philippians [Cap. 2, 6. 8.]: "Although Jesus Christ was in divine form, for he was like God, he humbled himself, and became obedient to the Father unto death, even death on a cross"; likewise the church sings: Vita in ligno moritur [Life dies on wood]. 1) 

Therefore, one must believe for certain that everything that actually belongs to and happens to human nature in Christ is also imparted to divine nature, so that it is rightly and truthfully said that God is born, suckled, lies in the manger, freezes, walks, watches, eats, drinks, suffers, dies 2c. There is an outstanding passage in the letter to the Hebrews, which belongs especially here; | will only mention it in this piece. Thus it says Cap. 2, 7: "Thou hast made him alittle less 2) than the angels", and soon after [v. 9]: "But him that was a little while less than the angels, we see that it is Jesus, through the suffering of death" 2c. And he says, "a little while,” that is, as long as he tasted death. What can be said more clearly? "He is," it says, "made less than the angels." Why? "For the suffering of death,” because he tasted death. Therefore he is a little inferior to the angels, whose nature is not subject to death. But He, although He is the Lord and Creator of the angels, although He is God by nature, because He is the Son of God, has nevertheless given Himself under death by humbling Himself. On the other hand, one must also believe that the qualities of the divine nature in Christ are in truth imparted to the human nature, because it is united with the divine one without any separation. Therefore Christ says

Joh. 3,13: "No one leads to heaven except the Son of Man", and yet he is still present on earth and talks with Nicodemus. You see, therefore, that to man or human nature is ascribed also that which actually belongs to divine nature. For in Matthew [Cap. 18, 20.] he says, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name," 2c., likewise Matt. 28, 20.: "I will be with you unto the end of the world." See, in these passages Christ certainly speaks of his personal presence, and since the person who is Christ is everywhere, it is also necessary that at the same time man and God, or both natures united with each other, be everywhere and truly present, hear, work all things in all, according to the words [Heb. 2, 8.]: "All things thou hast put under his feet." But since no human mind can attain or understand this with its understanding or wisdom, it must certainly assent to it in faith. If a man does this, he will only then realize (as godly people who know these things testify) that this article brings comfort in all the tribulations of sin and death. Likewise, he will also become aware of how much light it adds to the understanding of Scripture. And everything in the history of the Passion will seem idle and cold if this is not held fast. But now, I think, Peter can easily be understood from this, who says that Christ was given according to the flesh, and that the divine nature is not excluded from the sharing of suffering and death. For he says that he was given up to death according to the flesh; yet he says that Christ himself died, who is true God and true man. Therefore, God and man died. Furthermore, George says, 3) that when he has recognized this, no one can err who worships the dead Christ in the grave, for since he worships the dead, he also believes in the dead and buried, because the dead and buried was not only a man, but also God.

Luther's response to the book of Nebulo Tulrich. 


In defense of the double marriage of Landgrave Philip of Hesse, a Hessian preacher, Johann Leimig, pastor at Melsingen, had a "Dialogus" (the full title of this book is given in No. 2712) written under the pseudonym Huldrichus Neobulus on March 27, 1541, which Luther intended to answer with this writing, but which he did not complete. 


The original (according to the librarian H. Lindner) is in the Dessauer Gesammtarchiv with the inscription: "Antwort D. M. 4,. auf das Buch Nebulonis." Handwritten in Cod. 436 of the Heidelberg library, with the addition: "but has not even been finished". Printed by Walch, vol. XXI, 1577, without indication of source, with the superscription: "Luthers Schrift wider die Bigamie." Cf. De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 294 f. We give the text according to Walch. 

| had resolved to despise the disgraceful booklet Nebulonis 2) Tulrichi, and let it be answered with silence, as | have done to many other evil, poisonous books, as Schunds, Roizleffels, 3) Wizels 2c., which have all at once perished without my answer, which perhaps, if | had spent the time, effort and thought on them, would not have disappeared so shamefully. But because many of our people leave me no peace, and shower me with letters, as if by my silence the fool's writing would gain a reputation, | must do something and let myself be heard a little, at least what my opinion is in this, as | also answered those evil books in a few words. For it would always be a pity to answer all useless chatter of the loose fool, both for the time and the effort, moreover, since | thought that such loose arguments or reasons can easily be overturned by others who are more idle, because the fool, the master of the book, himself wants, feels and sufficiently gives to understand that he does not consider certain truth or right, what he

and probably worried that a woman might answer more than enough. 

That this is so, notice that: First, where the Nebulo is certain of the things, and would know them as right and for right to publicly represent or answer for, he would not have shied away from the light, but would have given his right name freely to the day. But if he is a child of darkness and a blind sneak under a false name, and wants to be no one who tempts the mob with dangerous speeches and loose reasons, whether it is right or not, that he has a quandary and wants to say: Yes, No, according to which the wind would be directed: then he is certainly not a good spirit, but the tiresome devil himself, a prince of darkness. And in this very piece, the master has disgraced himself in his wisdom, and condemned himself and his book alone, so that for this reason this book should be condemned, as it describes itself in its title as a book of darkness. For thus says Christ our Lord Himself, John 3:20 ff: "He who does evil hates the light; he who does the truth comes to the light," and especially he who wants to teach someone publicly, so that it may be known who and where it comes from. Although Christ does not mean to condemn what kings, princes, and rulers do secretly in their offices, even if they do not reveal it. Nor what is done in confession, nor what husband and wife speak to each other in the marriage bed, as | once heard a married matron punish her husband who wanted to talk out of the marriage bed: Marriage talk (she said), judgment talk, confession talk, secret counsel talk are to be kept silent, and are not wrong afterwards, whether they do not come to light, because God wants to know them alone; of it now is not time to speak. So also in the papacy the legend has always remained: Whoever sages confession should have his tongue torn out from behind his neck. 

| must say this, not to the master Nebulo, but to the devil, who perhaps wanted to stuff this saying of Christ our Lord, that many things must remain secret, which are nevertheless right and true; therefore he may also keep his name secret 2c. Non est simile, frater. He who publicly

No, Frater, that's not it, but ex ore et facto tuo judicaberis, and you have condemned yourself with your book, forced by your pusillanimous conscience to put a false, fictitious assassin's name on the book. 

The other knavery is that he introduces the examples of the fathers and of some kings, when he himself knows well that such things are of no consequence, for he is not the first nor the only one who has read such examples and histories, and yet no one has ever been found who has based himself on teaching such things, except this Tulrichus alone and the first. Thus we have proved by so many writings that Mosi's law is none of our business and is no longer a right; and not the examples of the history of the saints, much less of the kings, but God's commandment and their faith are to be looked at, as Hebr. 13,!) 7. says: "See their beginning all, and follow their faith", does 2) not say: Follow their stories. 

And tell me, what does such an evil spirit and false master deserve, who deceives people and poor consciences, and laughs at their ruin in his fist? Well, you shameful Nebulo, you are struggling for harm, which God has prepared for you on your head. 

The third and worst part is that he interprets the Proverbs Gen. 16,*) Matth. 19, 7. f. and others more so impudently and mischievously, and knowingly willfully perverts them, since he knows well that his interpretation is a filth, which distorts me to the utmost on the boy. And [I] realize well that he is away 5) from the rest of the thorns and thistles, which carried us the beautiful roses against the sacrament, baptism and original sin and other more Christian doctrinal articles, since they also interpret the Scriptures in their blasphemous errors, regardless of their own faith.

The law of Moses was not right, but a dispensation, a decree, not for the weak and needy, but for the hard, disruptive, wanton peelers. Now there is a great difference between the right and the imposition, patience or permission. Right is not doom, doom is not right, and he who does, gets or has something out of doom, does it, gets it or has it not out of right. 

If the letter of divorce had been a right, the holy fathers would probably have kept it. But there is no example of this in Scripture. We do find that those who did not keep this law are praised, and those who used this law are scolded, as can be clearly seen in Malachi, chapter 2. Abraham would not let go of his Hagar until he was forced by God. But what is a right, one must praise those who keep it and rebuke those who do not. Having so many wives is by no means proof that it was a right, but may well have been a fate. For there must have been very pious, holy men at that time, who took more than one wife according to the law 5 Mos. 25, 5. than to provide for the poor, abandoned women's bodies, among them some who were ugly or hostile, who were very difficult to accept and to raise, whom this Tulrich himself would have fled as the devil. The others really did not want to take and provide for more than one wife. They were free from such a law, as one can read in the book of Ruth [Cap. 4, 6], that their brother-in-law did not want to have them. If it had been a right, he would have had to do it. Now God does not punish him, neither in soul, nor in body, nor in good, for transgressing such a law without wearing a shoe and being called barefoot, which indicates what God thought of such a law. Therefore, taking many wives was certainly not a right, but a doom, no doubt to the benefit of the abandoned, poor womenfolk, so that they would have comfort from their friends, who wanted to be merciful to their poor friend. 





Thus it had also at that time another form in Judenthum neither with us. For women who did not bear children were almost worthless and despised according to the law: benedixit eis, as can be seen in Samson's and Samuel's mother, also in Sarah, Rachel 2c. Therefore, for their sake, God was all the more patient with them, so that they would have husbands and children, since they could not all have husbands of their own, just as it is now the case with us that many must remain without husbands and children. So there was a special need here that pushed for such a dispensation. With us, however, it does not take this form, because virginity and widowhood, even though they live without fruit, are not despised or worthless, but honest and praiseworthy according to the Gospel. It may have been just such a need that a man had to take a wife, won in war, so that the wretched, poor woman would also have a comfort and be provided for. So we may say against Tulrich, who proves nothing at all, and shall prove it thereby; and what is it necessary that we seek all cause, why the fathers and under Moses were permitted many wives? God is Lord, he may abolish, change, and mitigate his law as he pleases, out of necessity or without necessity. But it does not behoove us to do so, much less to establish a right that must apply or become an example. 

But our Tulrich leads along and gives free rein to carnal lust, and wants to create a world like before the flood, since they do not, like the Jews, out of God's permission, not out of necessity or mercy against wretched women, like Moses does 2c., but as the text says [Gen. 6:2]: "Which they chose according to their desire," not that it was necessary for their conscience, or useful for their wives' bodies; not that they desired the fruit of the womb, but because, he says, "they were beautiful"; seeking no more than carnal pleasure. So shall we also do, and do right and well (says Master Tulrich), may we take pretty matzos, as much as we want, and atone for the lust, not for the fruit of the womb, nor for the women's need, which the Jews had to do; let the ugly ones sit, even if they were fertile and might have help. Sic itur ad astra, so we go to heaven. So then we have Moses

and the fathers with their examples to beautiful covers of carnal freedom; say with the mouth, we want to follow the example of the fathers, and with the deed we do against it. Help God! What will this time become, when the world shall stand, when now such impudent boys are allowed to print everything they desire, and let us watch, who also should have consulted us beforehand, who have church rule and live publicly in office, but Tulrich is a mere nobody and wants to rule. Lupus in ovili. They want to adorn all courage from the Scriptures, since they themselves feel that it will not do, and the Christians will not suffer. But perhaps we have sinned too little under the papacy, and afterwards we have founded too little heresy. The longer the greater the abomination, the more we must commit it, otherwise God would remain too merciful to us. As | said, | do not want to answer the hopeless wretch for all his foolishness; others will do that. Also be aware that any layman who is a true Christian can easily mislay everything, as there is the and such foolishness, as he writes, although it is not written that Seth, Enos, Methuselah have had many wives 2c. Who does not see here that the fool deals with mockery and knavery and does not even take for truth what he says, namely Seth has had many wives. If the scripture does not say it, then | say it, or think so, that one should believe.

To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


Luther approves the request of the mayor of Zwickau to support the boys' school there. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, fol. 108. 41. Printed in the Leipzig Supplement, p. 97, no. 181; in Walch, vol. XXI, 459; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 421 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 1. 

Your most illustrious highborn Prince and Lord, Mr. Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg. Roman Empire Archmarshall and Elector, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg, my most gracious Lord.

Gracious Lord! The 





Mayor of Zwickau M. Oswald Losan, in which way they intend to improve the school in Zwickau, which he will know how to request of E. C. F. G.. And even though | considered it unnecessary that | should make my Commendation to E. C. F. G., because | know that E. C. F. G. (praise God) is inclined to support churches and schools, but he did not want to desist, | humbly request that E. C. F. G. (praise God) would be so kind. C. F. G. would graciously hear and understand his request; for it is true that the two boys' schools in Zwickau and Torgau are, before others, two excellent, delicious and noble Kleinoder in E. C. F. G. Land, where (as we can see) God bestows special blessings and grace in abundance, so that many boys are well educated there, and they produce useful and comforting persons for the country and its people. And it pleased me very much that those in Zwickau take on such things so seriously and bravely, since otherwise in other cities and towns such lundtroses 1) and scoundrels or godless misers rule, who have so much worldly devotion that they would like Christ to be with churches and schools, where Leviathan rules. So it does not seem to me to be a great thing that they desire from E. C. F. G., especially because it should not last forever, but for six years, so that some wealthy citizens, moved by E. C. F. G.'s example, would also do it. E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously show itself in this. Hiemit GOtt befohlen, Amen. On New Year's Day [Jan. 1] 1542. Mart. Luther.

On the other hand, the house Bruno to the apartment, so | bought under my wolf's name. 

Thirdly, the cups and jewels, as rings, chains, gift coins, gold and silver, which are worth approximately 1000 fl. 

That is what | am doing. 

First of all, that she has always held me dear, valuable and beautiful as a pious, faithful, honest spouse, and has borne and raised five living children for me through God's rich blessing. 

Secondly, that she shall take upon herself and pay the debt, if | still owe it (if | do not pay it when | am alive), which may be about, | know, 450 fl., perhaps more may be found. 

Thirdly, and most of all, that | do not want her to look into the hands of the children, but that the children look into her hands, hold her in honor, and be subject to her, as God has commanded. For | have seen and experienced how the devil incites and provokes children against this commandment, even if they are pious, through evil and envious mouths, especially when the mothers are widows, and the sons get wives, and the daughters get husbands, and the children get wives.

For | hold that the mother shall be the best guardian of her own children, and shall not use such chattels and chattel to the children's harm or detriment, but for their benefit and improvement, as they are her flesh and blood, and she has borne them under her heart. 

And even if after my death she would be forced or otherwise caused (for | cannot set God a goal in His works and will) to change, | still trust, and hereby want to have such confidence, that she will keep herself motherly towards both of our children, and faithfully share everything with them, whether it is a life bond or something else, as is right. 

And also ask hereby most gracious M. 3) Duke Johann Friedrich, Elector 2c., S. C. F. G. to graciously protect and handle such endowment or Leibgeding. 

| also ask all my good friends to be witnesses to my dear Kathe and to help excuse her, where some useless mouths want to complain or slander her, as if she should have some cash behind her, which she would steal or embezzle from the poor children. | am a witness that there is no money, except for the cups and jewels mentioned above in the Leibgeding. And this can be publicly accounted for by anyone, because it is known how much income | have had from my most gracious lord, and otherwise | have not had a penny nor a grain of income from anyone, except for what has been given as a gift, which is still partly in debt and can be found among the jewels. And yet | have built and bought so much from such income and gift, and have kept a large and heavy house, that | myself must recognize it as a special, wonderful blessing that | have been able to obtain it, and it is not a miracle that there is no cash, but that there is no more debt. This is what | ask; for the devil, if he could not come closer to me, he should search for my Kathe, only for the causes, in all kinds of ways, that she has been the husband's D.

To the venerable and worthy man in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus, the right, fair and faithful bishop of Naumburg, his superior who is to be highly honored. 

Grace and peace! | am very displeased with Medler's imperious behavior, my best bishop. Therefore, if | were in your place, | would continue with the opposite attack and insist on silence and peace against Medler until the visitation, in which it should then be determined where the patronage right belongs. For it is unjust to snatch it from them against their will, and one must act with them, that they may 


2700 


renounce it of their own free will. For this is how we acted during our visitation, that we persuaded those who had the right of patronage, but let those go who did not want to be persuaded. Thus all nobles confer their parishes as they have conferred them from time immemorial, without the authority of the prince or the church. If now Medler has excommunicated those figulos, “the Téppers", then you may command, as the right and superior bishop, that they be quiet. And néthige the Medler that he pursues what serves to the peace. It is not to be suffered that he takes the liberty to consider you a larva and a fairy tale, since the care for the church in Naumburg is imposed on you and you have to give an account of it. If necessary, | will write to him vehemently, since he is making noise in peace without cause. In the meantime, be a strong and patient man and [see to it] 1) that he cannot do anything else that God does not permit. But you have snatched this place from the devil, and the right fruits will abundantly follow. Be well in the Lord. | wrote this while my head was hurting badly all day long.

Naumburg, probably from the pen of the then syndicus and town clerk of Naumburg, Nicolaus Kroteschmidt or Krotteschmidt, flowed reports about Amsdorf's election and introduction as bishop. Sodann in Corp. Ref., vol. X, 162, and in De Wette- Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 298. Only the beginning and the end | in Melanchthon's manuscript) in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, fol. 452. A copy of it is in Cod. Goth. 451, p. 251). Printed in Corp. Ref., Vol. IV, 774. - Luther spoke these rathende words Thursday, January 19, after 5 o'clock in the evening in the Licentiat Dorferin at Naumburg Hause in the presence of Melanchthon and Spalatin, after the Estates had presented the case to them. The Estates, however, asked the Elector on the following day at 7 o'clock in the morning, "because such a thing would not go off without a hue and cry, that the whole action or at least Herr Doctoris Martini Luther's concern, on account of the common man, should go out in print". (Seidemann.) 


The following is the Doctor Martini's advice given to the foundation's members and written down on paper by Philippum Melanchthonem. 

This is established, certain and evident, if a ruling bishop persecutes the gospel in one or more articles, then the chapter together with the patron, or, if there is a lack of chapter, the patron together with the estates, is obliged to depose the same persecutor, if he does not mend his ways, regardless of the fact that the estates, as subjects, have done duty to the bishop. 1) 

For this is God's command and commandment, against which no duty binds, that idolatrous teachers 2) should be fled and that the church should depose them, as Paul clearly says: "If anyone preaches another gospel, let him be banished." Item: "He who does not leave father and mother" 2c. And this is also possible according to the ancient canons and the custom of the ancient churches, in which it was held that the churches themselves deposed the heretical bishop, as Paul Samosatenus was deposed at Antioch. 3) 

Since this is quite certain and obvious that the duty is not binding in this case, the same is to be kept by the chapter if it does not want to proceed to the right choice or adheres to a persecutor, and then such a chapter is to be kept in the same way as the persecutor, and the estates together with the patron are to be held liable. 


1) "To do one's duty" == to take an oath. 

2) In Seidemann: "Iher" == teaching; but in Melanchthon's manuscript in Corp. Ref.: "teacher". 

3) The following is missing in Corp. Ref., Vol. IV, up to the penultimate paragraph. 





It is the duty of every authority to appoint its own parish, irrespective of any duty or sovereignty, because the commandment to teach rightly and to hold right services takes precedence over all other commandments. 

Secondly, it is public that the duty of the estates cannot nor may not prevent the patron from contesting the wrongful election, and if the chapter loses its right to the election, it is certain that all justice to elect comes afterwards to the church, that is, to the estates together with the patron, for this is the old right and first order of the churches, as expressed in a writing Concilii Niceni and in many histories, that the election is done by the estates, that is, by the members of the churches in all estates. 

Since the chapter no longer has the right to elect, nor does it want to, the duty is at the same time interpreted 4) as a correlative, as far as the election is concerned; and if the election comes to another assembly, then the duty, so that the estates are related to the chapter, is not meant for the present person, but for the preservation of the churches in principle. 

Therefore also the words thus read: | swear to the church 2c. If the opinion of the estates and the patron is to have a Christian bishop, and to strive for Christian reformation of the chapter, consistories, planting of right doctrine, and not to abolish the chapter, then basically that is kept, which the duty is able to do, and which they all, patron and estates, owe before God. But let it be seen that such correction is undertaken with earnestness and not sought otherwise. 

But that one wants to speak against it: it may be that one should depart from unrighteous teachers 5), depose them 2c., but one may not withdraw from bishops or capitols in worldly obedience, fiefdom 2c. Answer: This is certain, that the parish goods and righteousness should and must follow to the service, as the Gospel speaks: "To the worker belongs his

Wages." Thus, these goods are not given to the canons for their pomp (gebreng) and idleness, but rather for the necessary fulfillment of the ecclesiastical offices, of which the text in the Codice commands in clear words: He who does not do his office shall not enjoy his prebend, and shall be deposed. And in this your patron and the estates have to have understanding. 

Above all this, it is known that the antithesis itself wants to have these two pieces inseparable: their idolatry and their worldly power or goods. They do not seek the preservation of right church government, but primarily and actually the suppression of right doctrine and the preservation of their unrighteous nature along with glory. 

Since they do not leave the episcopal office from the secular one, and we, as persecutors, cannot leave the episcopal office to them, the other must also follow the right bishop, as described in Decretis, that the Donatists were deprived of their church goods when they were no longer in the right office, and the same goods were turned to the right church government, as such the founders’ opinion undoubtedly was, and such examples are to be found more in histories. 

2) We are also more certain that we are doing away with them, that we are certain that the will, opinion, suggestions and practices of the priests are all directed primarily to the suppression of the truth, and not to right church government, therefore the patrons and the churches are to be remembered as resisting their ungodly nature. 

Item, as said above, 3) herewith the due obedience of the chapter is not withdrawn, because preservation of these churches and improvement, not diminution is sought, as also such should be the serious and thorough opinion, and not otherwise, and the will of the Estates thus stands that they want to show all reasonable obedience to a Christian bishop and chapter, which maintains the church government rightly and faithfully 2c.

To Justus Jonas in Halle. 


Luther asks him to give a detailed and complete account of the history of Frau von Rauchhaupt, since he intends to put it into print. 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 362. Printed in Schitze, vol. |, p. 183 and in De Wette, vol.V, p. 428 f. 


To the highly famous man, Mr. Justus Jonas, Doctor of Theology, the extremely faithful servant of Christ in the church at Halle, his superior. 

Grace and peace! Although there was nothing there, my dear Jonas, that | could have written, it was also not necessary that | write, if | had something that | could write, since your son Jonas could tell everything that | could have written, and] 4) you could read it from his mouth, even if | wrote nothing: However, so that | do not write anything, it seemed good to me that | write this, namely that you may see to it that the history of Frau Rauchhaupt 5) is described to me again in detail and in all its parts. For | have thought that this history is worthy of being published in print. We would add several other atrocities of Satan, if perhaps the security of the mob could be shaken, which is so furious that it not only despises the salutary miracles of the gospel, which are daily and abundantly manifested.

But you know that God does not care about these persons or larvae, since they are not the kingdom of God, so that Paul presumes to call even the apostleship a larva, Gal. 2, 6: "God does not respect the reputation (personam) of men." For the Church must appear in the world, but it cannot appear except in a larva, person, covering, shell, or clothing, in which it can be heard, seen, and apprehended, otherwise it could not be found anywhere. But such larvae are a husband, an official (politicus), a householder, John, Peter, Luther, Amsdorf 2c., although none of these is the church, which is neither Jew nor Greek, neither male nor female, but Christ alone 2c. Therefore, when the bishopric stands to its office, Christ will not care whether the larva is a private or a public one, one of the common people or a royal one; among all larvae and persons he can be worshipped, as the second Psalm [v. 10.] says: "Let yourselves therefore be instructed, ye kings" 2c.

Torgau. January 31, 1542. 


Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


The Elector instructs Luthern to answer D. Pomeranus to his letter that the Elector wants to let him serve in Holstein until Pentecost at the request of the King of Denmark, but refuses to let him stay in Holstein or Denmark permanently. In the postscript, he requests the early completion of the writing "about the Naumburg plot", and orders that the printing of the writing "for the sake of the Landgrave's other-wide promotion" (No. 2870) be halted. 2) 


The original concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. C, pag. 252. n. 15. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 405.

W., as we are now returning from our Diet to Torgau, which content 3) you will hear from the enclosed copy; our also dear devotee, Doctor Pomeranus, has also written to us in particular, as you will no doubt have received from him the good report.

W. of Denmark, as a Christian king and our special dear lord and uncle, for his Christian3) purpose and for the comfort of the people, we would do him the favor of his person for a time, as we have done before. 4) Now that we cannot note anything else from his own letter to us, except that he has placed his will in God's will and ours, we graciously let it happen, where he would not otherwise know how to preserve anything special, that he will not be able to deal with K. W.'s W.'s emissaries, who are now at Torgau, to Holstein, we also want to assign him one of our single-horse soldiers, who shall wait for him next to the royal envoy and ride with him until he reaches Holstein and the K. W.. We write to the king that we would permit him, albeit with complaints, but only for the sake of Christian and friendly experience, until Pentecost and no longer; we also indicate to the king several reasons why it would be inconvenient for us to grant him further permission, and provide that the king will be well satisfied and content with this. Therefore, we also let him rise the more favorably, so that he will come back that much sooner. But that we should agree that he should remain persistently in Holstein or Denmark, such we do, as has happened before, to his royal dignity. His royal dignities. 5) It has also been a gracious favor to us that the said Doctor Pommer does not know how to leave his appointment with us and at Wittenberg, for among other things it is not hidden to us, as he writes to us, that he means us and our lands and people for eternal and temporal welfare and completely faithfully and diligently. Therefore, we are also inclined to him, along with you and other of our scholars, with but grace. You will graciously show him this with better diligence, 


1) Here we see that Luther was supposed to communicate the answer of the Elector to Bugenhagen, but not, as Burkhardt says in the table of contents: "answer the letter of the King of Denmark".

4) Bugenhagen was in Denmark from 1537 to 1539.

and you do us a gracious favor. Date Torgau, Tuesday after Pauli Conversionis [Jan. 31] 1542. 

Note. After you have also recently let us, together with Philippo, be humbled at Naumburg that you both, one in German and Philippus in Latin, wanted to have the Naumburg plot published by means of a print, 6) we do not doubt that in the meantime you will both have been at it and will now have produced the work or will have produced it conducively, so that it will go out in print with apparent Christian causes. This is also done for our special gracious favor. 

So we also had our chamberlain inform you next to Naumburg that it seemed to us that you were in the process of letting something go out for the sake of our cousins and brothers, the landgrave, and other graces. 7) And although our mind and opinion is not to put you to some measure in what you consider to be that it could not well be circumvented for the praise of the Almighty and for the good of the Christian people, 8) nevertheless it will not be without where our cousin and brother, the landgrave, should be expressed by name or in an understandable way, that it would give rise to all kinds of reflection with S. L. in it. If you ever thought that it could not be avoided for Christian reasons, we graciously request, because we cannot talk to you about it in person, as we have indicated to you through our chamberlain, that you be so kind as to send us as many copies as are already printed, and that we remain silent until our further letter with further printing. In this you do us a special gracious favor, to recognize in grace and good. Dated. uts.

(Wittenberg.) February 6, 1542. To Nicolaus von Amsdorf, Bishop of Naumburg. 


Luther wishes that Amsdorf's letter messengers should always wait for an answer from him; he forbids gifts to Wildpret and recommends a painter, without, however, wanting to bother Amsdorf with him. 


6) This was done by the writing: "Exemplary to consecrate a right Christian bishop", which was published at the beginning of March. See St. Louis edition, Vol. XVII, 88, No. 1257. 

7) What is meant is No. 2870, not, as Burkhardt says in the table of contents, a writing against the landgrave.

German in Walch, Vol. XXI, 1482. 


To the man venerable in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus von Amsdorf, the loud and exceedingly faithful bishop of Naumburg, his superior who is to be highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | hope, dearest brother in the Lord, that my letter has been delivered to you. One thing | ask of you, that as often as you write to me, you may at the same time command the messenger to request an answer, or you may indicate through whom | should answer you. For Jonas also troubles me with this, that he so often desires that | should answer, but no one 1) demands [the letters]. For after the letters are delivered, the messengers go away and do not return. The same happens to me more often, so that they often leave written letters with me to perish. And it would require great wealth if | had to send a special messenger for each letter. Nor am | so idle that | would have free time to write letters in vain, since | do not have much leisure and time even for the necessary ones. 

Then, what you write about the wild game, that my request may not be fulfilled, but during my stay in the country (in rure meo) such winged words were uttered. For | do not want you to doubt that | have resolved never to ask anything from you; so | will do now; not because | despise you, but because | do not want to arouse their courtly suspicion among our centaurs, who, corrupted by ardent hatred, are looking for opportunities to belittle us as if we wished to rule through you; secondly, because | know that you have turned from a rich preacher (in Magdeburg) into a much poorer bishop, who has more needs than in Magdeburg. But | also want you not to care about my letter of recommendation in any way, unless it should be entirely convenient for you. For | believe that you are firmly convinced of this through our long friendly contact. 


1) Instead of millies at De Wette we have assumed nullus. Walch offers: "but nobody demands them from me". 


that | am such a man, who wants to be a burden or a complaint to you least of all, but rather a comfort and a relief. Therefore, you should do so here: because you want to use the service of the painter M. Sebastian, you should not use him, if you do not also want to use any painter. He is known to you, and you have used his work in Magdeburg. But he asked that | recommend him to you, which | could not refuse the good man; perhaps 2) he is thinking of greater things than really exist. | also do not know whether there will be a use for him there. But whatever it may be, you will see to it. But | would wish that you had a little better furnished and daintier dwellings, for the sake of the flesh, which must not lack its care and rest, since this is without sin and guilt. The Lord be with you, for we too are continually with you in spirit, Amen. On Monday after the Purification of the Virgin Mary [6 Feb.] 1542. Yours, Martin Luther.

For they hand over your letters to me in such a way as if, after they have thrown them away or handed them over to someone they meet, they were forced to take care of other things or to kill the Turk in the meantime. Or, if you do not take care of this, do not doubt that | cannot answer anything. | am too poor (you know that) to be able to send letters to you with my own messengers, then too busy to be able to find out who from here might be going to Halle or traveling away.

Bucer's wife died in the plague, all his daughters and one son. Many learned men died, which | believe you know. 

A certain friend writes from Basel that Carlstadt has died, and adds a strange story: he assures that a ghost is prowling around his grave and in his house, making noise in various ways by throwing stones and rubble. According to Attic law, one may not revile the dead, so | will not add anything. 

We have arranged for the Hungarian reports to be published by print. The Poles indicate that the Turkish tyrant is seeking autocracy in Europe, and that there is no doubt that he will invade Germany and seek passage from the Poles. They promise that they will fight if they get help from the Germans.

Luther rejects marriage to the wife of the deceased brother as quite unchristian. 


From the Ludwig Collection in Halle in Schutze, Vol. |, p. 191 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 436. German in Walch, Vol. XXI, 1485. 

Since you seek counsel in the matrimonial matter of a brother who married the wife of his deceased brother: Flee these abominations of the devil and do not burden yourself with other people's sins. It is not a question of whether they are to be divorced, but they are to be considered unbelievers (a Christo alieni) if they do not divorce immediately and go to foreign countries full of each other, one here, the other there, for the sake of the greatness of the outrage. Otherwise, there are enough sins by which we are oppressed that we do not have to bear these monstrosities as well. If your Silesians continue to anger God in this way, it is safer to leave them.

(Unauthentic letter.) 

This letter, which is found in De Wette, vol.

That this letter belongs to the year t541, is also proved by No. 2866, the letter to Duke Moritz, in which Luther indicates that he writes at the same time to Count Albrecht. De Wette brings this letter from the alleged "in Eis 


1) Apologia pro reverendis et illustribus Principibus Catholicis. Bucer responded to this in his Sctirift: De vera Ecclesiarum in doctrina de cerimoniis et  disciplina reconciliatione, and gave in 1543 against this: Replica Joh. Eccii adversus scripta Buceri Apostatae. (De Wette.)

He considers it necessary to note: "This is officially assured; however, the orthography and grammar are not entirely Lutheran. It is superfluous to print the entire letter here, because the largest part is found word for word in No. 2865; however, for those who might doubt the correctness of our judgment, we place the beginning of the letter, remodeled from the letter of March 14, 1542, here.

About the campaign against the Turks, for which one prepares oneself with all kinds of vices and contempt of the word of God, so that there are worse Turks in Germany than the Mahomedan Turks. In His wrath, God will punish the despisers and blasphemers.

Grace and peace in the Lord! What you write about the campaign of our princes against the Turks, | do not know whether they are equipped 3) or will be equipped, but even that. | do not even know whether it is useful for us to agonize over when or how they will arm or be armed, because they themselves, as you write, do not believe that the Turk is armed, they who are the most obstructive hinderers by being equipped with avarice, prosperity, usury and (what is frightening) with contempt for the Word (which they consider to be the word of man, not of God). Yesterday | received letters from Silesia, which | am sending you (but dll have to send them back), which almost killed me, because | saw that the son of

God's words and sacraments are so trampled upon. Although we (as carnal people) love Him exceedingly coldly, yet, if there is any other 1) feeling in us, | could not suffer that a pig or a dog should be despised with such words, since | believe of Him at least with a little spark that He is the Son of God and Sheblimini, and with my weak love against such a Savior 2) | would not stand, as | hope, to give away at least one life out of gratitude against Him. But these things are the monstrosities of Carlstadt. Whether these are milder or lesser things, which are said about ours, the matter will show, since they say: "| am your pope! What do | ask for D. Martinus?" Since, therefore, for this reason, the world gives us such thanks, since we are still alive, why do we pray, why are we worried that the Mahometan Turk would kill such Christian and worse Turks? 3) As if it is not better to be in the service of the Turks, to succumb to the Turks, enemies and foreigners, than to succumb to the Turks, friends and natives. And if they laugh at God in their sins, may God also laugh at [them] in their sins, so that, just as they do not hear God, since He speaks, asks, exhorts, pleads, does everything, endures, suffers, yes, bears in the heart of Noah's sorrow and cries out in the godly prophets and rises early: so may He also, in turn, neither hear nor see at their ruin, since they howl, wail and cry out in vain. "They know that it is God whose word we speak, and yet they say, "We will not hear. Summa: they are driven by raging furies, because the wrath of God has come upon them to the end. Why then do we want to consume ourselves because of these shameful people? Let it go as it goes. Let us pray that 4) the name of God be sanctified, and His kingdom come, and His will be done. 


1) Instead of nullus we have assumed ullus. 

2) According to Burkhardt, we have inserted here from the original: amore non dubitem, ut spero in ejus gratia unam. This is the only improvement that Burkhardt communicates.

be done. In the meantime, let the world perish and be destroyed. "| want to have made provision for such shameful furies. 

There is no news, only that Herr Philippus tells me that he has received a letter from Poland that the Turk has sent two armies, one to Austria, the other to Silesia, and also a pasha who is to invade Poland with a strong crew of Tartars. |, at least, know of nothing that is being prepared against these forces, unless, since we despise the enemy, we have the confidence to kill them by drinking Torgau beer, or by playing dice of masked persons (personaticis), that is, by silence, to repay them in kind. 5) Thus | pour out my words to you, my dear Jonas, after | have conquered my anger, my thoughts and my temptations in a great struggle. Praise be to God who comforted me and said: What cryest thou? Let it go as it goes. But even now | cannot let it go as it may, since | cannot so easily let go of my beloved Saul, and with heartfelt sighs | wish that Germany, my fatherland, would be saved, which before my eyes, and while | live, is perishing and gone. But God's way is just, which | must not resist. God have mercy on us, since no one believes us. Farewell, my dear Jonas, and greet all of ours, especially yours, whom | beg you not to grieve with this letter, because | wrote this in agitation; after all, God wanted it to be all wrong, amen. On Friday, St. Matthew's Day [Feb. 24], Anno 1542. Yours, M. Luther. 


5) Instead of perdendum (?) we have adopted pendendum. The meaning is not doubtful: we try to overcome the Turks by drinking beer and playing dice. To justify the translation we have given, we include a passage from the exhortation that the then Rector, D. Jakob Milich, addressed to the students on February 18 (Corp. Ref. , Vol. IV, 780): "We, which is our office, wish to maintain good discipline and to dampen the will to anger. Therefore we forbid nocturnal shouting and noise, likewise the running around of masked persons and the game of dice, which has its name from silence (mussitatione). For with so much corruption of morals, what else can sensible people suspect but reenactments when they see unknown masqueraders, who are silent and speak with a wave of their hand, breaking into other people's houses? That is not compatible with decent and noble behavior."

Exhortation to maintain Christian discipline and Order. 


Printed under the title: "Vermahnung Doctoris Martini Lutheri, in abwesen Doctoris Pomerani, An die Vniuersitet vnd den Rathe vnd Buraerschafft zu Wittenburg. 1542." quarto. This print is in the Royal Library in Berlin. Then in De Wette-Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 302. 

That the preacher earnestly exhort to prayer, and first of all, to mend, both the city and the school. Forsooth, the wrath of God, greater than anyone believes, has come upon Germany. The regiments are nothing (this is an evil sign, as Isaiah 3 says), so the enemy, the rod of God, is at the door. 

Therefore, | ask both city and school for God's sake, that they do not let the cry come over them, that they have heard God's word so long and so abundantly, and yet not only have not improved, but also have become more and more angry the longer. For that would be terrible to hear before God and the world that the gospel was preached here by me for thirty years, with great effort and work, and beside me also for many years by others, and that now at the end of my life | had to experience and hear that it had never been worse than now. Which would have to grieve me greatly, even the Holy Spirit, which would not be good, and a sure sign that this city deserved a special disgrace, like Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum. 

So the council wanted to be diligent to punish the vices, the citizens also control the avarice. For, dear God, what is that, if now the grain is all cheap, and yet the city, neither in bread nor other, nothing more helped, because it was very expensive. So 


1) Seidemann thinks that this admonition could also have happened in November, but we give preference to the above time determination because of the admonition of the Rector to the students of 18 Feb. 1542 mentioned in the previous number. Also Bugenhagen was no longer absent in November, but returned from Denmark to Wittenberg around Pentecost. See Burkhardt, p. 405, note. 


even in other trades and crafts, that God will truly punish such injustice and avarice and make the bag (as Haggaeus says) leaky, so that they will not become any richer, but only poorer, and even if they do not feel it now, their children will feel it too much. For so it is said: Radix omnium malorum avaritia, avarice corrupts everything, country, people and what should nourish itself. This is what experience gives and teaches. 

| ask my brother Studium, the poor old preacher, also for God's sake, to keep quiet, chaste and honest, to wait for them to be sent here, and to keep them here at the heavy cost of their own, so that they may learn art and virtue, because the time is here, and such fine preceptors are available, and yet accept this request and admonition of mine as full of God Himself. For God says: You shall honor the gray head. 

But if they grieve my spirit, so that | have to hear, as Noah heard his world, that God complains [Gen. 6:6] that it grieves him, then they will not escape their flood of sin. Oh my brother Studium, spare me, and do not let it come that | have to cry out like St. Polycarpus: Oh God! why did you let me experience this? | did not deserve it, but there are my and your preceptors' faithful works, which serve you for the best, both in this and that life. | hereby command God, who will help you to resist the devil, the flesh and the world, amen. 

If | could have preached myself, | might have said more.

To the man highly esteemed in the Lord, Anton Lauterbach, pastor of the church at Pirna and bishop of that region, his extremely dear brother in Christ. 

Grace and peace! "Harvest the Lord and be of good cheer" [Ps. 27:14], my dear Anton. If there were no temptation to exercise the faith of Christians, then what would happen to the safe, idle, pleasure-seeking Christians would mean the same thing that has happened to the papacy. Since the temptations are rhubarb, myrrh, aloes, and the antidote to all the worms, pus, putrefaction, and dung of this body of sin, it follows that they must not be despised. But we do not have to seek or choose them according to our will, but rather receive them, of whatever kind God wants them to be, since He knows which ones, of which kind, and how great they are, are most useful and suitable for us. Therefore, be strong, and think that if we have to bear any trials (as is true), we would rather bear them than worse and heavier ones. Let go, and bear all that the centaurs (nobles) and the papists undertake. But do not refrain from acting, writing, supplicating, and trying everything with the prince, and wherever it is at all necessary. Who knows when God will give a good hour? Do not be afraid, lest we be found as people who have grown weary and have given way to your devil, the tireless enemy, and then we feel remorse for our actions too late and are ashamed of our softness. So may you not torment yourself for the sake of your mother, who would rather live in Stolpen under the papacy than in Pirna to the annoyance of the Gospel. Pray for her without ceasing, and you have done enough. Surely it would not be good if everything we wish or desire were to happen soon and instantly. God takes better care of us in

He sees the folly of what we are about to desire. 

We have no news about the Turks, not even about a campaign of ours. In Belgium, the emperor issued a public edict forbidding rage against the Lutherans. Since there had been peace in France for two years, the Gospel had gradually crept in through imported books. When the monks, the sophists and the parliament learned of this, they began to rage so that they burned 50, but under such great indignation of the people that the king, lest a noise and riot arise in Paris, was compelled to intervene and control the cruelty. The bishop of Cologne began to change the abuses in his diocese. Praise be to God who glorifies His Gospel, so that if our countrymen, like those of Bethsaida, Chorazin and Nazareth, do not receive the prophet in his homeland, the Samaritans and the Cananaean woman 2c. will receive him, and those will be left in their disgrace. Let us only continue to preach, pray and forbear. There is a reward for our labor, and we do not labor in vain. In haste. You are well in the Lord, and at the same time pray for me, that | may fall asleep at some good hour. | have completed the race, | have kept the faith, | have fought the battle as much as | was given according to my measure. 

Greetings to your Agnes and Elisabeth. Greetings to you, my [Lord], Mrs. Kathe, and all of ours. On Friday after Reminiscere [March 10] 1542.

Letters from the year 


1542. no. 2892. 2893. 2727 





Grace and peace! With regard to the son-in-law of the provost at Kemberg 1) | cannot do enough for your wishes, my dear Jonas, therefore you must look for another first Diaconus (protodiaconus). But | wrote to you yesterday in anger about the abusive messenger, and even now the anger is not yet gone; therefore | remind you again that you must not send such messengers to me, or | will see to it that he is dragged to prison with his neck tied and rewarded for his virtues. Be mindful that this is said to you. For | will not suffer an infernal messenger to revile in another's house, that is, in my own, and to think that |, that is, my family, is subservient to him. He may, of course, revile and command as much as he likes, but in his Hanse and his own, not to Luther, or his house and his own. "Otherwise | will let him tear out his tongue at the back of his throat." How, then, do servants and rags (centones) also think that they are rulers? 

By the way, what you write about the Senate is very pleasing, that it loves the word; | heard it with pleasure and give thanks to the Lord, who will continue the work he has begun. | know nothing of a warlike armament against the Turk; it seems the Turk unfern Centauren a zero 2) to be. For at a court, | do not know which one (I think it is ours), they say, this boastful speech was made: the Turk has not yet seen any men of war. And M. Philippus told me that he had heard from some Poles in Regensburg that Margrave Joachim the Elder, the father of the present one, had boasted with these words: the Turk had so far fought against red boots (that's how he called the Poles and Hungarians), but when he would have started to fight against greased boots, then he would realize what kind of people they were. God likes to hear these boasts (as you know) and gives them His blessing.

new blessing. The summa is this: God has thrown us into the midst of these great braggarts, and compels us to act with them and pray for them, at the same time also to suffer what happens or will happen, for the sake of the Word, which He wanted to reign so abundantly and powerfully in us; "otherwise | would also know what to do in this. We are people like Atlas, the saviors and victors over the world, the devil and hell, only that the world does not understand this, just as it is not worthy of it. Let us therefore be strong and carry ourselves. "It will not be otherwise." One does it who is not praised, another is praised who does not. Thus the world does not know that it exists through the strength of others, namely, the church, and thinks that the church exists through its strength and the strength of the world. 

Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honoros [This | wrote, another gained the honor]. Fare well in the Lord you confess. In haste (as | use to do). On Friday after Reminiscere [March 10], that is on the day of the equinox. 3) Greet your wife and all yours and ours, also in the name of my mistress Kathe, who ordered me to do so when | wrote.

rather want to paint at least alphabetical signs. That you write that perhaps everything is full of falsehood and hypocrisy: | know, not perhaps, but in all certainty, that everything is colored (fucata), even in all the nobility of both parties, as much of it is in the administration [of the offices], or in a high position either of honor or of wealth. Our court is not pure either. The sum is: All that will be good and salvific will be (do not doubt it) solely the power of our prayer, through which the church is mighty with God, as it is said [Jac. 5:16.], "The righteous prayer is able to do much if it is earnest," and again [Jn. 14:13.], "What you shall ask in my name, that will | do." | leave it at that, and cooperate by praying, sighing, and constant longing, as much as is given me. With regard to everything else, whether it be advice or remedies, | try to banish thoughts from my mind, since | know how deceptive and futile they are, as we have experienced too much up to now (since we were slow to believe it). Therefore you too should pray and advise to pray, unless you have good hope for the children of men, which is not advisable. Christ has begun to awake, who shall neither sleep nor slumber henceforth. Let us leave the management of affairs to him. 

But we have recently heard, or rather read, written from Hungary, that the most invincible (that is what the Turks call him) Emperor Soliman has given Michael Bock as property (pro servitio) a strip of land from the borders of Poland to the Danube. In the same letter he commands them to come to him and obey his orders on pain of death and loss of all property and the removal of their wives and children. And so it was done. But with all these punishments no voice is yet heard, either in Hungary or in any part of the world [Ps. 106:6.], "We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have been ungodly." We detest the punishment, we do not acknowledge the sin, we do not change, but defend it to a great extent. And we hope 





or pray that God should have mercy on these people who are as hard as Pharaoh?

To the noble and well-born lords, Mr. Philipps and 

Mr. Hans Georgen, brothers, counts and lords of Mausfeld, my gracious, dear sovereigns. 

Grace and peace, and my arm noster. Gracious Lords! | am sorry that | cannot begin my first letter to Your Grace, as my dear countrymen, more cheerfully, without [it] not being my fault. 1) E. G. certainly know what talk and clamor have been going on for a while now about my gracious lord, Count Albrechten, which | truly have to hear with great sadness every day, how S. G. force and press their subjects, also publicly dragging them to themselves, which is not due to J. G.. |, however, as one easily came to, answer that | should have nothing to do with this, or what it concerns me, or that | should ask about it. That is true. But | am a citizen of the Mansfeld dominion, whom it behooves to love his fatherland and lords, and to wish them well, and who is also a public preacher, who is obliged to

admonish where someone, seduced by the devil, cannot see what wrong he is doing. 

Therefore | ask, Your Grace, to graciously hear my poor sighing, or if that could not be, to be my witness (as you must do) on that day that | have faithfully warned and done my part. 

| think that the evil spirit is tempting some, who should help to ruin God's rule. For God has given the Lord a dominion, which one would not want to grant without cause, according to the world, to be grudging or unfavorable, or, as one speaks, out of envy. For four have what, he has his enviers, and much more of them, all of whom wanted that G.E. were beggars, and perhaps, as | think, because the wretched heretic D. Martinus is the sovereign's son, so that they would have to boast: "Behold, how G.D. lets all the cursed perish, who cling to the Gospel; as a sign is his own fatherland, the noble and praiseworthy county of Mansfeld, in which the boy was born, so corrupted to the ground. Because God the Lord has placed the G. in such dominion and commanded him to do right, | humbly ask and urge the G. to see to it and help that such injustice does not continue, otherwise God will demand it of the G., as they can do and yet do not. For the G. have to consider, if such an example should break, to take from the subjects what is their own, then every overlord will eat up the underlord, and like the nobleman the peasant, so the prince the nobleman and count. For if it is right here, it is also right there, What will then become in the end but a regiment worse than the Turk has, even a devilish regiment. And if this does not happen, then God will let a curse go, because he cannot stand injustice. So beware, | am innocent. 

For that my lord, Count Albrecht. Lord, Count Albrecht, perhaps thinks that the dominion and all goods are his own: God says no to that, and will not suffer it. For peasants, burghers, and nobles have their own goods, but they are subject to fiefdom, according to imperial law, which is confirmed by God, and so they have it by divine right. Whoever now wants to seize the goods for himself, so that fiefdoms should also go with them, there is 


Letters from the year 1542. no. 2894. 





2731 


Not to have God's grace and blessing is also to steal and rob before God, as his commandment says: You shall not steal, nor covet your neighbor's goods. For although Count Albrecht is lord over land and people, he is not lord over the fief and property of the goods that the emperor gives; for he is not emperor, but a count. 

All in all, God's blessings are in the country, and they want to see to it that God does not take them away, and that the descendants, God's heirs, do not have to complain: Oh how a rich, blessed dominion our ancestor, Count Albrecht, has spoiled for us. The evil spirit through envious people seeks E. G. and my dear fatherland, that hurts me; for what else do | ask about it, | who walk on the pit, and can seek nothing else, but that | would like to meet the blasphemers, who will boast of the Gospel to the shame, my fatherland and sovereigns would have had to spoil only for my sake. For it is certain that if the G. will not do so, and M. G. Lord, Count Albrecht, who is truly overpowered by the evil spirit, will resist, then the G. will also be guilty. For it cannot stand like this, as | hear from many, and most of all from those who laugh at it and like to see such ruin, which also moved me to write so vehemently. For where the mine falls, so lies the county, and all enemies laugh. But if M. G. Herr, Count Albrecht, had a lack (oh, Lord God! Lord God! it will not be him) that the citizens live so superfluously, then the matter would probably be easier to advise: punishment laid by abundance; from it the lordship would become richer, and the subjects also fatter, as happens at Nuremberg and elsewhere. 

But here is an angry devil who wants to work so that neither master nor subject shall have anything. All books say that it is better to have rich subjects than to be rich oneself. For even being rich is soon lost, rich subjects can always help. 

However, | ask once again that E. G. would graciously grant me such an earnest letter; for be it as it may, | cannot be unhappy with E. G., my dear sovereigns, and grant my fatherland nothing bad, as | want to be with E. G. as with my gracious sovereigns.

G. has let pass between my daughter and those at Kiritzsch; for the judgment pleases us well, and in kindness (where it succeeded to that part") ) we would have granted more for the sake of peace and good neighborliness. 

On the other hand, | also thank for the wine, although this is a left gift. 

Thirdly, the gentlemen, Rector and University, have indicated to me, as ordered by E. C. F. G., [that they] the estimation of my houses

and goods are not to demand from me, but to suggest the protégé; 1) | also thank you humbly. But | must thank E. C. F. G. my thoughts and ask that he graciously hear them. 

The large monastery house, if | had to, | would not be able to estimate it; for | am in despair that after my death my wife or children would have to pay for it, if | can hardly maintain it with roofing, glass and iron, even though the third part has not been built, and the best thing about it is that E. C. F. G. Lauts has the preemption on it. So | also hear, and can easily believe, that if the time should continue like this, it might happen that the Halls and Collegium would have to be filled up as a defense; therefore | had previously considered buying Brun's house for my daughter and child the closest room to it, [bought it] for 400, and 20 fl. that same, but paid nothing on it, without 120 fl., which | owe, without the time of day, as in 10 years to pay, having moved me: of which | can also hardly give an estimate, because | enjoy nothing, and is vain debt. 

But in return | will humbly ask that E. C. F. G. would accept the other goods from me at a discount: namely the garden for 500 fl., the farm with the garden for 90 fl. and a small garden for 20 fl. And the reason is that | would like to be in the army against the Turk with my poor penny, besides others who give it willingly. For there is enough of the unwilling otherwise, so that | would be an example, and the shy eyes would not have to envy too much, because D. Martinus would also have to give. And who knows whether our, the willing, penny may please God greatly with the poor widow, who put in more with her Scherflin than the rich, neither the unwilling florins, and | would like to be among those, who would also harm the Turk with bodily action, or suffer harm from him. For if | were not too old and too weak, | would personally like to be among the 


1) For the levying of the Turkish tax, Luther himself drew up a list of his possessions, which the university sent to the Elector in copy. Burkhardt, p. 409, has communicated the same, and we attach it to this letter.

But my prayer with the churches prayer has long since been in the field, so that | worry that our Germans will be too presumptuous, and before that despise without repentance the enemy, who is not to be despised, as he has all the devils in hell with him, and where God will not be with us with his angels, | have little hope for our power or armor 2c. 

Most recently, | read Julius Pflug's writing, although | got it too slowly, but at the end | patched something into it. 3) But it is a very bad thing that he is attacking us with the spiritual right, which they themselves do not touch with a finger.

phets stand up. For how should those arouse heresies who despise the Word in an epicurian way? Germany has been and will never again be what it was. The nobility is intent on dominion over everything, against which the cities seek council for themselves (and rightly so); thus the empire, divided in itself, must go to meet the army of the devils raging in the Turks. And we do not care much whether we have a merciful or a wrathful Lord, since we will conquer and rule over the Turks, the devils, over God and everything through ourselves. So great is the completely frantic confidence and security of the perishing Germany. But what shall we do? In vain we complain, in vain we cry. It only remains that we pray: Thy will be done, that we pray for the kingdom and the sanctification of God's name. When this happens, let it go, fall, stand and perish as it will. Let it go as it goes, for it wants to go as it goes. Why do we torment and consume ourselves in vain because of the shameful people who will perish and have to perish? There is no injustice to the one who wants it. 

lam surprised that you have not heard the news, namely that Nicolaus Amsdorf has been ordained bishop of the church of Naumburg by the heretic Luther on your Fabian's Day [Jan. 20], a Friday. A bold deed, which aroused a great deal of hatred, envy and displeasure. Now my book about this matter 5) is being printed. What will happen, God knows. The Lord Philip writes about the same matter. By God's grace he is healthy and well, but the very heaviest Atlas that carries heaven and earth. Brenz is alive, Carlstadt died of the plague at Basel, which itself was a plague for the church at Basel, as the bishops of that church write to us; they also add that, since he was ill, he was plagued by evil spirits, and that they were still making noise in his house after his burial. | always wanted and have wanted him to be blessed, but his impenitence to the end | cannot want nor approve.

To the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


Luther asks the Elector to take care of Count Gebhard of Mansfeld, whom his brother, Count Albrecht, is trying to deprive of his. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. N, fol. 108. 41. Printed in the Leipzig Supplement, p. 98, no. 183; in Walch, vol. XXI, 461; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 452 f. and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 13.

G. and peace in the Lord and my poor Pr. nr. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! Although | have come at an inopportune time with this writing, necessity compels me to do so. How Count Albrecht of Mansfeld acts with his brother, Count Gebhard, | respect, be it E. C.

F. G. unconcealed. | have read all the contracts and letters (although | have enough to do otherwise), and lament me of the good pious lord that Count Albrecht acts so shamefully with him, is even judge and part, wants to take also the goods and county from him, and so to him alone the use, or usufruct, 2) he wants to take it all, land and soil, and disinherit him of the county; a wild merchant who buys the apples and wants to take the tree and garden with him; does not do otherwise, because as a lodge he has no overlord. Where should the good count go now, if he does not have protection and help from the princes of Saxony, his sovereigns? Although the county is in fief of Duke Morizen in this part, E. C. F. G. are also heirs in the case; has therefore asked me to write to E. C.F. G., and if D. Brick had not indicated to me that | might not meet E. C. F. G. now, nor would | otherwise come at an inopportune time, | would have set out today to serve the good lord, regardless of my inconvenience. So now | humbly ask that E. C. F. G. would graciously help in this matter and have Duke Moriz act so that Count Albrecht does not make such a mess in the dominion to the ruin of the dominion and princely fiefdoms and honors. For if Duke Moriz were to do nothing here, as his profession and office require, and thus leave the good lord unprotected and unheard, it would bring E. C. F. G. an evil cry in heaven and on earth, and greatly anger God, who everywhere in Scripture prophesies against those who do not save or help the oppressed, of which | hereby also write to H. F. G.. E. C. F. G. would graciously grant me this necessary writing; for the good Count has personally come to me for the sake of these things, and desires such writing in addition to my personal journey. Hiemit dem lieben GOtt befehlt, Amen. For it seems as if all the devils in the world are otherwise idle, and have laid their hands on us Germans, because they do not want to suffer God's word.

Grace and peace!

You see what a terrible trouble Satan has caused between our prince and Duke Moritz. May God defend and humiliate the nobility, especially in Meissen, a type of people that is completely corrupted by luxury, indulgence, pleasure, avarice, usury and godlessness. But perhaps the iniquity of the Amorites must become full, and the

The people of the Holy Land have enemies, of which they would have either none or contemptible ones today, if not only the nobility were raging against us. Thus they fear that they may be thrust out of the dominion by which they have hitherto had the princes and bishops as subjects and servants. | often remember a certain saying of yours about the adulterous princes, and it seems the word in the Book of Wisdom Cap. 3, 16. and 4, 3. is fulfilled: "The children of adulterers do not prosper, and the seed from an unrighteous bed will be destroyed," and: "What is planted from fornication will not take deep root, nor will it establish a certain foundation. May God hear justice, amen. | am very much hurt by that ingratitude (which is undoubtedly detestable to God), because Moritz would not even have been born, nor become anything, if Duke Frederick and John had not preserved his father against Duke George. But those who are destined to perish must perish in this way. 

You know that Carlstadt died, of whom the Basel clergy wrote that he had been an exceedingly poisonous plague for their school. But he died because the devil killed him. They write that while he was preaching, a man of great stature appeared to him and many others, entered the church, and stood next to a certain citizen in an empty pew. He went out again and entered the house of Carlstadt. There he found the son alone and picked him up with his hands as if he wanted to hurl him to the ground, but he let him go unharmed and ordered him to tell his father that he would return for him after three days. Thus, they say, he died after three days. They added that after the sermon was over, he approached that citizen and asked him who that man was? But the citizen said that he had not seen anything. So | believe that he, seized by sudden terror, died of no other plague than from fear of death. For he used to be terrified of death.

Our gracious greeting before. Venerable and highly learned, dear faithful! We are working very hard to put an end to the unfriendly disputes that have arisen between our dear cousins, brother, son and godfather, the Elector and Duke Mauritzen of Saxony, by proper and appropriate means and ways, so that they do not take up arms any further, destroy the country and its people, and thus cause irreparable harm to the gospel of the region. But we find both parts quite hard, so that we cannot judge whether and what result we will achieve with them or not. Now, according to the enclosed copy, we have thought of several means which seem to us to be uniform and useful for the removal of this error, since it is almost basically only a matter of the passage through Wurtzen, which Duke Moritz, at the request of the Elector, believes to have free and unobstructed, and which the Elector intends to allow him only jure familiaritatis. Since the matter is not worthy of discussion, that both princes and rulers should therefore come to such hardship to each other, on so many dangers, not only to both their loved ones and the same lands and people, but also to the whole of our Christian religion and the same relatives, as you yourselves can reasonably judge, and we consider it that our dear cousin and brother, the Elector,

To which we replied: We would do so most diligently. In addition, we again asked H.F.G. to act with Duke Moritz so that H.F.G.'s protection would not be weakened. And although we knew nothing of the secular law, especially of this case, we nevertheless consider that H. Moritz would do wrong, with such pernicious, bloodthirsty furnem, to establish his law himself, before such dark (Tunckel) and disputed law would become bright and clear; for because it is disputed, it is not bright, and one disputatio will continue to bring another for and for. Accordingly, we ask that whatever E. C. F. G. is ever able to do, in honor of God, and to let such misery degenerate, be found gentle and kind, God will know how to honor E. C. F. G. again for it. Sometimes you have to get a mad dog's foot out of the way and light two candles for the devil or throw a mash into the mouth of the Cerbero (as the poets say).

Answer to No. 2904: Luther expresses his joy at the prospect of a settlement of the dispute over spices, and assures us that he has no ill will toward the landgrave, but that he is only annoyed by the book of Huldrich Neobulus.

Grace and peace in Christ our Lord! Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! | am very glad to hear that E. F. G. has gained hope for a settlement of this troublesome, dangerous discord. May God grant further and final mercy, as we earnestly pray and now calmly hope. However, | would not have imagined that H. Moritz should act so ungratefully and unkindly against the Elector, when all the world knows that he would not have been born, much less become such a prince, if H. Frederick had not done so. Well, he is struggling for God's wrath. It will come to him before he thinks, if he does not atone for such a wicked deed for the sake of a muck, which he could have accomplished with one word. God protect the people who are to march against the Turk, so that H. Moritz does not have to be in the field, otherwise not only the Turk, but also thunder and lightning shall strike us, where such an unpunished bloodhound, who has committed father-murder, brother-murder, brother-in- law-murder, even father- and son-murder so stubbornly. [But] 1) | will speak against him with a Lord, who shall be man enough for him, and shall sit secure from his works at the right hand of God. 

The other things that E. F. G. write to me about, | know [they] well, how faithfully | have always meant E. F. G., and also carried over it hard enough to spare E. F. G.. But the wicked book of Huldrich Neobuli would have spoiled it so badly that it could have written such [lazy] 2) jokes, which are not only unworthy of the cause, 3) but

He himself did not know what they needed his unfunny youth for, but this does not excuse him, because he owes much more gratitude to this part, because he can always enjoy more than he was born with, if he had not become such a prince, when H. Friedrich and H. Hans seliger would not have stood by his father against H. Georgen Cain's fratricidal malice. Oh how such ingratitude shall stink in heaven before all the angels of S. Moritz and arouse a terrible anger against his cops. Praise be to God that we are worthy to receive evil for the sake of good, and that not we, but others [against] 1) us, are found 2) ungrateful. For this is a noble and precious treasure in the sight of God. Well then, may God strengthen, comfort and preserve my lord.

We, the pastors and preachers of the churches at Witteuberg, confess that after the witness of these writings, Balthasar Hausmann of Belgran, brought testimony that he was called to the pastorate at Kreuschaw and was of honest, Christian morals, and we requested that he be interrogated and ordained, so we have diligently tried him.

He has also promised to carry out his ministry diligently and to remain steadfast in the Christian truth of the Gospel, as it is confessed and taught in our churches by God's grace in harmony with the true, Catholic Church of Christ. For this reason, Balthasar Hausmann is publicly ordained here in the church according to the command of the Holy Scriptures, and he is commanded to preach the Holy Gospel and to administer the Holy Sacraments as he is called. And ask our Lord Christ to grant him his grace and Holy Spirit, so that he may serve for God's glory and the blessedness of the churches.

God grant these shameful tyrants, to whom there is no hope because of their indulgence, usury, avarice, presumption, faithlessness, hatred, impiety, hypocrisy, sedition, deceit, perjury and all iniquity and wickedness, their reward in His time, who have instigated such a patricidal war, amen.

G. know without a doubt that the weak old man, He Johann Mantel, has been given an Elemosyna from Gotha, which has amounted annually to 40 fl.; in addition, Magister Georgio Rérer has also been given 10 or 12 Thaler annually.

G. and F. in the Lord. Gracious Prince and Lord! | have learned that the lords, my lord princes, E. F. G.'s cousins, are not well off, that E. F. G. has taken and occupied the monastery at Munich-Niennburg without their consent, and that they have also been about to carry out a reformation of it, and have been too slow in finishing it. Now that they have the right and power over the same monastery, | would like to humbly request that the F. F. G. help to promote such a reformation with their support, so that no further ill will may arise between the two parts. For even if they were to place a director there, the reformatio would turn out badly, and more than the monastery is able to do would be lost, although E. F. G. in good opinion wanted to set the goal for the abbot, and did the best. Where now E. F. G. would unite with them in this.

God grant that the beast will also fall with the pope, the worst prophet. Carlstadt's wife has written a letter here, which is full of grief, and severely accuses the tyranny of her husband (even after his death), that he left her naked and bare, and she no longer has her valuables (clinodiis), is in debt, is without a home, weighed down with five children, has nothing of her own 2c.

They are unworthy of hope, usurers, adulterers, envious people, Summa, with God and the holy angels, yes also with men, although these are ungodly, hateful and detestable. Until, therefore, you have not heard this word from them: We have erred, we repent, we want to change, be deaf to all their words. It is quite certain that they are satanic and deceptive, although they have often communicated under both guises, because the epicureans do not care much whether they communicate or not. Then, because they have also repented, it must be demanded that they approve of what we have done so far and will do in the future. Otherwise, what kind of repentance would it be if they condemned our deeds, thatis, if they fortified all theirs by a fictitious repentance?

Mr. Anton Lauterbach, your pastor and my special friend, has told me a lot of good things about you, so | have decided to address this letter to you as to an unknown friend. However, | know very well that M. Anton is not lying, but | have sharply disputed with him about the success or the outcome of his proposal, because it has often gone differently than | would have meant. For | have freed many of your class, castles (publicanos == tax collectors), who had stained themselves with abominable sins in this country, from a weighted conscience; | do not know whether | have brought all of them to heaven. But since | cannot say anything good about the wicked, nor anything evil about the good, | will therefore now be satisfied that you are a righteous castor or tax collector. For this is something new in the world. For M. Anton wanted me to have it with him, and so wanted it from me. If, therefore, you are a new castor among the old, as | am a new theologian among the old theologians, God grant that | and you and all who love the gospel may firmly persevere in the true faith and the knowledge of Christ. | ask you not to take offense at my joking mockery, which | made with an unknown friend, but rather to attribute it to M.

Luther asks this prince, who was governor in the Mark, for protection for the pastor Erasmus Alberus, who was challenged by some of the council in the new city of Brandenburg.

To the illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Lord 

John, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien and Lord of Bernburg, my gracious Lord. 

G. and F. in Christ. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! | have had to hear several times how the people of Brandenburg in the new city, but not the common man, but some of the council, are making themselves exceedingly angry against their pious preacher, M. Alberum, whom the common people love very much, and are doing 1) this especially now, because of the absence of the landlord, m. gn. Herr Churflirsten 2c., they let themselves think that they are lords 2c. Therefore, my humble request to E. F. G. is that E. F. G., as Vicarius in the Mark, protect the aforementioned preacher against such wanton people, so that he is not forced to turn away from the Mark. E. F. G. understand well how cunningly the devil intends to eradicate or drive out the Gospel. | also hereby send to E. F. G. of the same M. Alberi writing and complaint to me, from which E. F. G. can hear his request. May the Father of all mercies grant us all his Holy Spirit, that we may be grateful and not deserve to have his word taken from us again, Amen.

Your Serene Highness, Most Reverend Prince, Most Gracious Sir! | was very pleased to receive E. F. G.'s letter, as well as the secretary's verbal solicitation. | also ask, as before, that Your Grace (as you heartily request) see to it that the sectarianism does not break down; for attention must be paid, because the enemy is not a painted or carved image, but, as Christ says, a living, yes, a ruling prince and God of the world, as we well experience every day. 

| am glad to hear that the Royal Prince of Brandenburg 2c. requires us to wage war against the Turks, and | would like to see such a great and powerful enemy resisted in a fitting manner. But that it should be a vocatio, that is nothing, because E. F. G. are not required by the empire. It should be a friendly service as from a neighbor, because of which E. F. G. can stay at home without any danger to their conscience, as well as it is necessary. Where E. F. G. would want to go out of a sense of duty, only for friendship, then E. F. G. would have, [their] 2) request, the two scholars here who are capable enough for the army preaching office, eight also, where they would demand E. F. G., should they be found willingly. For the sake of the surgeon, | do not know how to answer this question, since they are not here or have already all been requested. Our dear Lord Christ bless E. F. G. and keep her in all graces, Amen. Friday after Trinity [June 9] 1542.

To the noble, well-born Lords, Albrecht, Philipps and Johann Georgen, Counts and Lords of Mansfeld, my gracious and dear sovereigns. 

Grace and peace and my poor pater noster. Gracious sirs! | have experienced all too certainly how E. G., so close friends, cousins, brothers, father, son 2c., have come to each other, about the parish and schools at St. Andres at Eisleben, which is only sorrowful from the heart; as it is fair that |, as a country child, serve my fatherland and natural sovereign with all loyalty, and see to it, especially when | see what the wretched devil has in mind at this last time and need of all Germany, since it would be necessary that there be unity and love between all estates, but most of all between such close blood friends, because the Turk, God's wrath, is lying so hard on our necks. But it seems as if God does not want to answer any prayer, but to punish the old, previous sins, committed in the papacy, along with the contempt of the outgoing Gospel, in heaps, and to leave room for the devil in all kinds of willfulness. And it is grievous enough to me that there should be disunity among you friends about the word of grace and peace, that is, about the parish and schools 2c. God, the merciful Father, forbid the wicked devil, and forbid the evil mediators who cause such discord between us, amen. 

Accordingly, my heartfelt and guilty request to your Lord, my dear country lords, is that you humble yourself in honor of God and His Word, and conduct this matter with gentleness and not with sharpness (as the devil would like), and act kindly toward one another (as God would like). For with the sharp way of going against each other, the Gospels will not only lose the Gospel themselves, but will also give cause for both the parish and the school to disintegrate. 

For that | say to God beforehand: You will not get any capable persons for the parish and school, and | do not want to and cannot consider him to be a conservative, who will allow himself to be used in such discord, much rather for a capable and evangelical pastor or schoolmaster 2c. It may still be God's grace, where the rule is completely united, and the school and the parish also 





that there may be harmony among the church and school servants in the face of the devil, who is an enemy of both offices. And what one starts in God's name and favor is hardly obtained with effort through earnest prayer and much suffering; what good should come out of it that is started in the devil's name and will, that is, with pride and arrogance? 

Has there been fine unity since the uprising or even longer, since the parish has been papist and the preacher evangelical: how much more should it be so now, because the Gospels have accepted and want to have the Gospel in both parts? And it is indeed a special challenge from Satan, that it is about the Jure Patronatus, which is foreign and of the bishop of Halberstadt, whether the present one has given it away for his person, but after his death it will be returned to the Halberstadt monastery, which will not easily provide the parish with Christian pastors or preachers, as this bishop has done out of fear and in rebellion, and would thereby gain more than he had before, or had ever lost with God and all honors, namely the preaching chair and school (as it was little respected without them). Therefore, my gracious dear sirs! Let us be in favor of it, and not improve other lords with our own harm, for which they will ridicule us, laugh in our fists, and take us for folly or children's play for our quarrels. 

It also means what a great annoyance and a game of joy for the devil and his people this will be, that such fine and highly famous lords and counts, evangelical on both sides, get so angry among each other about such small, in addition foreign Jus Patronatus. It is not, it is not suitable, it does not please God, not yet a pious Christian man. Our Lord may well send down counselors on both sides, and in kindness let such things be calmed and settled. And what | and all of us can do to that end, we would gladly do. And we ask God, the Father of all graces and unity, to give us a gentle, soft heart towards each other, to accomplish his work (if we want to mean both), contrary to the devil, ina grave and blissful way, amen.

To the highly honored man, Mr. Daniel Cresser, the extremely faithful pastor of the church in Dresden, his very dear brother. 


Grace and peace! | thank you, my dear Daniel, for your extremely godly letter, in which you command me to GOtte. | believe, however, that the preaching ministry assumed in the church at Dresden is a difficult one for you. For | know certain Meissen centaurs who are very hostile to the Word and at the same time exceedingly hypocritical. But the Lord, the truth, will put an end to their plots and pretensions. And | liked your magnanimity in which you write that you do not fear the adversaries but yourself, that you may not be equal to the work. But he who is with you in this generous spirit will not leave you alone in the face of the adversaries in carrying the work. In Him we are, live and weave, and again He is, lives and weaves in us and is mighty in our weakness through His power. Therefore, be confident and be strong, and wage the wars of the Lord as you are called to do in this corrupt and frenzied age. For the church has need of you and yours, which we cannot abandon if we do not want to be robbers of God, since it is so afflicted, troubled and weary, since it is laboring, weary and sick, and crucified with its Bridegroom. Fare well in the Lord and continue, as you have begun, to pray for me also. On Friday after Viti [June 16] 1542. M.L.

The Mainzer is a great warning example for me, what and how characters of this kind tend to act. Carlewitz is Carlewitz, and has people who keep him warm. Therefore, you should not trust the words until you have seen the deeds. | would easily excuse the prince himself, who according to his age is still clumsy and inexperienced, but the nobility and the host of Satan are raging, so that it is necessary to pray for everything, to fear everything, but to hope for better things, because Christ lives. Greet the Lord Rivius and Greser (Cresserum), 2) and admonish them not to doubt that they are (because they will persevere) warriors of the Son of God, who is called the Lord of hosts. For they do not fight with flesh and blood, that is, the courtiers, 3) not for this mortal life and stinking matter, but against the evil spirits under heaven, that is, for the life which is eternal and glorious and incorruptible and imperishable. Therefore we should do so, Ps. 27, 14: "Harvest the Lord, be of good courage, and do not fear, and wait for the Lord." [John 14,

Schmedstadt was appointed professor of theology in Rostock. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. 186. 4. printed by Schitze, Vol. |, p. 211 and by De Wette, Vol. V, p. 480. 


Martin Luther, Doctor of Theology, Dean of the College of the Theological Faculty, says his greetings to all who read this letter. 

Heinrich Schmedstadt from Ltineburg stayed at the school of our church in Wittenberg for about eighteen years, 1) with extraordinary praise of virtue and godliness. And since he had made excellent progress in philosophy, and had been decorated with the degree of Master, he took good care to teach others at the school. In the meantime, however, he always added to his other work the study of Christian doctrine, diligently listening to the interpretation of the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures, researching the antiquity of the Church, comparing the opinions of all, and speaking out about the whole doctrine in a precise manner. And because he_ correctly understands the doctrine of the church of Christ, and accepts the pure opinion of the gospel, which our church confesses in one spirit and with one voice with the general church of Christ, he has also been commanded to preach here with me, and he has given a specimen of his learning, and testified quite clearly that he has the same opinion which our church confesses. Now the noble prince, distinguished by wisdom and virtue,

2769 


When Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg called Heinrich Schmedstadt to the academy in Rostock to teach theology and asked him to bring our testimony with him, we were pleased that the noble prince, Duke Heinrich, would see to it that the churches were advised and that the salutary teachings were preserved and propagated. For truly, this must be the first concern of all rulers, that they teach the nations the true knowledge of God and glorify the honor of His Son JEsu Christ, as the word of the Psalm [Ps. 72,11.] reminds us, that the nations should all convert, and the kings that they serve the Lord. And because we approve of the manners and scholarship of Heinrich Schmedstadt, since he lived with us for so many years and taught publicly, and promised faithfulness and constancy in godly doctrine, we have gladly given him a testimony. So that this would be a public one, according to the usual custom of schools, the degree of Doctor of Theology has been conferred on Magister Heinrich Schmedstadt by the judgment, vote and approval of our College, after a public disputation. And only implore God to govern his actions, and also commend this Doctor Heinrich to the noble princes, the Dukes of Mecklenburg, and ask that they may well protect him. For it is useful for the church and for the community that good teachers are protected and assisted by the reputation of the princes. And that this service is pleasing to God, many sayings of God (coelestes) and examples testify. How rich a reward God promises to the prince Ebed Melech [Jer. 38, 7. ff. 39, 16. ff.], who pulled out Jeremiah, who was thrown into the pit, and received him. We also exhort Doctor Heinrich to endeavor to maintain the harmony of the church and academy at Rostock with ours, especially because it is to be desired that the academies, which are commanded to lead in doctrine, sing in one spirit and with one voice with the angels the glory of God and peace on earth. For God wants the teachers to be the comrades of this choir and ministry of the angels. Given at Wittenberg, July 10, 1542. Martin Luther.

Grace and peace! Although |, my dear Spalatin, (like Paul) care very little about what serves to preserve life or the belly in this life, as far as | am concerned, nevertheless, since | am a husband, | am also, as the same Paul says, a debtor to my household; whoever neglects the care owed to these has denied the faith, and is worse than a heathen (1 Tim. 5, 8.): therefore | beseech thee, that thou render me in this matter that service which thou wouldst desire me to render against thee, and wouldst justly and rightly desire, namely, that | may not be deceived or abridged or cheated concerning the gift of the prince (which | esteem great). You know the manners of these birds of prey, who easily seek out what serves them, setting aside love for one's neighbor. And in addition to this, it is difficult in that region to obtain such trees as | have obtained, and they may have wanted to make use of this advantage through me. However it may be, | want the trees that you listed in your letter, which are left to me, to be preserved for me as my own, be they taimen or oaks, that is, instead of the sold ones, to remain unharmed and in full number until | have claimed them. 1) De tremulis, or that | commit no error.

Those who bought them must do so, 2) and restore such trees to me without harm, or it will be like a practice that | will be deprived of the wood that | will send to my most gracious lord. For | will, as your letter also testifies, have my wood, which the pious prince gave me and which is difficult to obtain in this place, completely and utterly and will not knowingly let anything be taken from me. You should thank the Lord of Einsiedel very kindly and | want to earn it (where | can). But how can he have boards cut if he has no wood that is mine? For the sold wood was mine. Now | have to buy it again and bring it from the yard. When will this happen? So | will lose my wood that the prince gave me. But it shall not be kept silent, nor shall it be given to them.

But in these questions you could have consulted others before, since you wanted to be taken for an inventor of new doctrine (novus auctor). For that you say that warm water is not a pure element, but mixed with fire, | wonder what may have come into your mind. With the same wisdom, another will say that cold water is not a pure element, but mixed with earth, because the philosophers say that the earth is cold and dry. Another will say that moist water is not a pure element because moisture is the very property of air. Let us therefore desist from these inconsistencies. 1) In the other question also, you do not properly distinguish the properties (/diomata) of the natures in the person of Christ. For the Godhead did not die, but that God, namely Christ, who is not God according to his nature, but according to his person, or has the Godhead, died, just as again not mankind created heaven, but the person who is man, or has assumed mankind, created heaven.

| had hardly sealed the other letter, my dear Jonas, 

when M. Philippus came, who would bring me public, prescribed letters, which were to be handed over in our name to M. Johann Kraus (Ousio), that poor Lazarus, and no doubt one of the least of Christ's, so that he should use them to beg where he could, after having demanded in vain, with so many writings, journeys, efforts, cries, the crumbs that fall from the table of that feaster at Walkenried. It cannot be said nor written how much | have been moved by the baseness of so great a cause, and | have virtually cursed all the goods not only of the abbot, but also of Michael Meienburg, who enjoys in a pleasant manner the goods of the monastery and feasts from the same, from which, however, this old man, who is blind and now a public beggar, should have been provided. What is it that we pray against the Turk, implore God, teach the people, while in the meantime those who want to be evangelicals certainly provoke the wrath of God through avarice, robbery and plundering of the churches? just as the people let us teach, pray and suffer, and in the meantime they palliate sin against sin. Therefore | beg you, my dear Jonas, that if you have any fellowship with them, break it up for Christ's sake and do not concern yourself with their sins and curses. For Christ, no doubt, esteems this Crans, his poor Lazarus, higher than the whole world, to say nothing of those two bubbles of water,

How beautiful it would have been, since Michael received so rich donations from the abbot, if he had been mindful of this poor Lazarus and had said to the abbot: "My dear Lord, | will spare it so that this Lazarus can have the crumbs: Abbot would have said: My dear Lord, | want to do without it, so that this Lazarus could have the crumbs!

To the respectable man, Mr. Wenceslaus Link, Doctor of Theology, the extremely faithful servant of Christ in the Church at Nuremberg, his very dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! You complain, my dear Wenceslaus, that your Bibles are late, but you have forgotten my letter in which | informed you that the workers are overwhelmed by so many books to be bound. There are so many that many cannot get theirs before a full half year. And | myself, who gave three copies for binding, have now wrung one out with difficulty a month ago; the remaining two will hardly be returned to me after Michaelmas. The princes from all regions have their copies bound here, and these take precedence over us, you and all, which one must suffer for the sake of the favor that the workers thereby acquire with them. 


2776 


You will get your two copies, which in any case can happen in a short time. 

| cannot promise anything about your Genesis; our printers and booksellers are reluctant to print large books because, as they have experienced, they often could not sell the copies and would have spent the costs in vain and suffered damage. Otherwise, if | could do some good with my preface, what need is there to ask for it, since you know that | am willing? 1) You would have done well if you had given it (as you write) to Secerius, or could give it to someone else in Upper Germany. For these are so unoccupied that | almost want to burst when | see that such good paper, such delicate type, such careful workers are employed with exceedingly useless, even harmful books. Bucer and his like are writing that should write nothing. You understand me. Fare well in the Lord. On St. Jacob's Day [July 25] 1542.

Grace and peace! What dil write about the powers of the devil in the three people, 2) who hanged themselves, | read with fear, my dear Anton. God gives us ingrates and despisers a prelude to the future wrath, since he allows so great things to Satan within our church. What will be the end of those who do not believe in the Gospel? Such things must be presented to the people so that they learn to fear God and not to despise the power of Satan with such certainty. He is the prince of the world, who, to our contempt, invents that these people have hanged themselves, while he is

This proves that it is impossible (as you write) that a person sitting or standing could be suffocated by such a small stick that has been driven in. It is the Satan to recognize. By the way, about that whore who opened her sister's womb, write carefully. | am anxious to put some such examples into print, so that they may be told in the sermon, whether the untamed security of the common people could be broken a little.

To the highly famous man, Mr. Justus Menius, the extremely faithful bishop of the churches in Eisenach and Thuringia, his extremely dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! It is extraordinary, my dear Justus, how the urging and impetuosity of your sons pleased me, who, in order that they might be like you and represent you, their father, by the example of perfect diligence, left me no peace until they pressed out an answer. God grant that they may be so in all things and persevere as such, especially in that which belongs to godliness and honorableness; | wish and desire that this also be done in my children according to the will of God. 

With regard to the money full of Weissensee, do what you do. For that magister, a new husband, to whom it is given through the mediation of D. Brick, is quite meager. Those may watch, which have exercised a fraud, or have not exercised.

About your calculation [of years] this is my opinion: | have encountered six quite similar difficulties in one book alone, namely in the One Book of Judges, as you have. And | would still follow your thoughts today if | had not overcome them then, when | was at work and they tormented me. For that you wanted the word 1 Kings 6:1 to be understood as if the 480 years were only to be said of the good judges, not of the people or subjects, as only two years seem to be counted of Saul and only eight years of Joram 1) - you may see how many inconsistencies you will bring up in history here, yes, in the church. For this conclusion is null and void: the people was sinful, therefore there was no people of God at that time or no God of the people, especially of the one who had the promise. Balaam says 4 Mos. 23, 2) 21 [Vulg.]: "There is no idol in Jacob." Whereas Amos says [Cap. 5, 25.], "Have ye sacrificed unto me in the wilderness the forty years?" If therefore under Moses (yes, under Christ there was a Judas and a godless people) there were idolaters at the time when there was no idol in Jacob, even according to his own testimony, since he says, Deut. 12:8 [Vulg.], "Ye shall not do as we do this day, every man what seemeth him right," how much more were there such people under Joshua and others. Yes, Ezekiel says [Cap. 23,3. f.] that the breasts of Ahalibah 3) were touched. And the other prophets say (as also Moses) that they were rebellious against the Lord from the beginning. What is this but that the Church of God is praised as constantly holy and chaste, and yet at the same time it is indicated that there are children of the devil in it, yes, Satan among the children of God! Therefore, | cannot agree with you that 1 Kings 6:1 is to be understood as the number of the good judges only, but rather | will

believe that Apost. 13, 20. the number 400 is wrongly set for 300, as | have indicated in my chronicle, 1) since also the narration of Stephanus Apost. 7, 6. must give way to the Chronicon of Moses, as | have shown in my Chronicon 2). Therefore, you must bring another comparison of Paul in Acts Cap. 13, 20. with 1 Kings 6, 1. This opinion of yours is not enough for me. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me.

These are the days which, as we judged in our last deliberation, should have been expected when your mayors and the Syndicus, Mr. D. Kilian, were here. The trampled Son of God has also glorified himself on his enemies. This unexpected and unbelievable victory has been given to us; in all, both in ours and in the adversaries, the appearance of the Lord has become manifest. And although | do not wish the wrath of God and damnation upon this monster from Mainz, | am glad that this wicked old rascal (Dau. XIII, 52. Hist. von der Susanna)

He has lived so long that he has had to see this terrifying condemnation of his exceedingly diabolical counsels and the irretrievable fall. Praise be to God, who establishes justice on earth and catches the wicked in the works of their hands, so that they cannot bring their days to the half. Now let him weep as he is worthy, and live to his own punishment, since he has so far had so many triumphs in the joy of his unworthiness, against GOD and all that is GOD's. Give thanks, | pray, publicly and solemnly with us, for GOD has done wonders with us for His glory, and has not despised the supplications and groaning of His poor, but in a short time has directed the vengeance of His own who cry out to Him.

For my thoughts are such that after you there will be no schoolmasters equal to you in diligence, especially in grammar and strict adherence to good manners. Therefore mau must be aware of the time; the time flees with fast foot, and much faster still go careful teachers there. Afterwards they will return here more successfully for higher studies.

To the highly famous man, Mr. Georg Spalatin, Magister, pastor of the church in Altenburg and superintendent of the churches in Meissen, his brother who is highly venerated in the Lord. 

"G. u. F." Dearest Spalatin! What you write about our friend, Mr. Heinrich 4) 2c., | have read, and with admiration | have read this example of such rare conscientiousness. And in the first two pieces he brings himself, weiln no longer, yet sufficiently in harm, and perhaps, if he acted according to the will and during his lifetime with them, the farmers would be satisfied with less expense. About the third there is no question, after they have voluntarily accepted those provisions. Therefore, tell him to be sure and of good cheer, since in many dangerous matters one neighbor should and must (as they say) give way to the other for the sake of peace, and in doubtful matters (where there is a good sense) one should not anxiously seek doubts (perplexitates), much less be afraid of the other. 


4) Already Seidemann in De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 667, s. v. Henricus assumes that Heinrich von Einsiedel is meant. This assumption is confirmed by Luther's letter to him of April 30, 1545, which concerns similar circumstances.

You rightly write that it is God's miracles that are performed against Heinz Mordbrenner.

God grant that we may be of a humble mind, and ascribe victory to God Himself (as it is in truth) with praise, and fear His judgments, because neither are we without sin, nor is that man punished for our sake, but God has been compelled to inflict punishment, as it is written [Ps. 140:13]: "He will execute the cause of the wretched and the right of the poor."

This extremely gratifying victory is stained for me and for others by bad rumors. For it is told of such a great rapacity both of ours and of the great ones, that in me the fear rises, that the inhabitants of the country once under favorable conditions would rather fetch their Mezentius 2) again, than suffer these robberies. "How utterly it is nothing" with the people in these depraved times, and how frightening it is to have a man of war and a friend, even a believer, in the army.

To the illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Lord Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien and Lord of Bernburg, my gracious Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! Mrs. Selbitz and her son, Georgen von Selbitz, have kindly asked me to make this written intercession to E. F. G.. After E. F. G. had spent a thousand guilders in thalers and silver coins, the thaler at four and twenty GI., and the silver coins at one [and] 3) twenty for one fl., with the promise that they should be presented again in the same kindness at the time of redemption; now, however, they are receiving the thaler, as it now stands, at five and twenty Gl, which | can well imagine that the F. F. G. did not mean to seek any disadvantage for the good women and their son, but the bailiffs are now doing the same everywhere, and want to make the lords rich with small benefits (where they are otherwise so pious and do not mean themselves), although it basically helps nothing, but rather as a break-off of the neighbor to the breaker.

Your request and mine is also most humbly, that E. F. G., according to your promise, let the same kindness suffice, and not let the harm come upon you. For E. F. G. would be of little help with the foregoing, and yet would cause a sting to the conscience. There is really not much left. The F. F.

| have reminded your son, as you wrote, with a stern and serious admonition that he should gratefully obey his father, and indeed vain such a father, and be mindful that God has blessed him with such a great blessing that the father saw the years of his [the son's] manhood while he was still alive, through whose counsel and help such a frail age and original sin could be governed, given the great wickedness of the world and the fury of the devil. He vowed that he would be obedient and await your and the teacher's advice. 

| believe that the rumor has told you that my exceedingly dear daughter Magdalene has been born again into the eternal kingdom of Christ, and although | and my wife should only happily give thanks for such a happy escape and blessed end, through which she has escaped the power of the flesh, the world, the Turk and the devil, the power of natural love is so great that we cannot do it without sobs and sighs of the heart, yes, without great mortification. Namely, the looks, words and gestures of the living and the dying exceedingly obedient and reverent daughter cling deeply in the heart, so that even Christ's death (and what is the death of all people compared to his death?) cannot completely take this away, as it should be. Therefore, give thanks to GOtte in our stead. For 2) He has indeed done a great work of grace for us, since he so glorifies our flesh. She had (as you know) a gentle and sweet and quite lovable character. Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ, who called her, chose her and made her glorious. Would that God would grant me and all of us such a death, rather such a life, which | ask only from God, the Father of all comfort and mercy. In him be well with all your relatives, amen.

To the venerable brother in Christ, Joh. Augusta, servant of the divine word among the brethren at Leitomischl, his very dear [friend]. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! My dear John, your brother Lorenz 2) from Leitomischl has requested a letter from me to you, and has informed me of your opinion of us, how true and sincere it is, and that you remember me in your prayers. Therefore, | am grateful to all of you and ask that you continue to pray for me. For | am convinced that the time (horam) of this miserable life of mine will not last long. But | wish that God may take my soul away from here in peace; may He grant it in mercy, Amen. 

Furthermore, | exhort you in the Lord to persevere with us to the last end in the fellowship of the Spirit and of doctrine, as you began. And fight together with us through the Word and prayers against the gates of hell, which without ceasing set themselves against the true Church of God and against its Lord and Head, Christ. Although he sometimes seems to be no match for the power of Satan, his power is mighty in our weakness, his wisdom is praised in our foolishness, and his goodness is glorified in our iniquities and sins, according to his wonderful and incomprehensible ways. May he fortify, protect, sustain and perfect you with us in the same image of his and to the glory of his mercy, which must be praised forever, amen. On the day after Franciscus [Oct. 5] Anno 1542. Respectfully greet all brothers in the Lord. M. L.

Grace and" peace! It is true, my dear Jacob, what you write, that N., the child of perdition, is afflicted by God, as he deserved, and as the previous prophecies against him wanted. But this example of God is not only presented to the tyrants of our time (as the examples of all times also go over the tyrants), but also to the despisers of the Word, whose Germany is full, and especially to those who begrudge your N. his misfortune very much, but do not hate their own sin very much. And you, Scotist, tell us what difference there is between an exceedingly ungrateful despiser of the word and an open tyrant. Both of them say in their heart: There is no God, only that N. has been angry in an unusual way. Otherwise, our sins are pressing us enough, as you know, but we complain in vain. Let it go as it goes, because it goes as it goes. 

We have new monsters of locusts around, which | have taken in general sight. They have not yet been here, but in the not distant neighborhood there is such a great cloud and crowd that wagons and horses move one, two, three miles away, as it were, through rattling crabs. The plague is raging on all sides. We have little or nothing from Hungary. My extremely dear daughter Magdalena has gone away to the heavenly Father, having fallen asleep in complete faith in Christ. | have overcome the paternal movement of the heart, but with a certain threatening murmur against death; through this displeasure | have soothed my tears. | loved her very much. But death will suffer vengeance on that day together with the one who is the author of it. Fare well and pray for me. On the day of Dionysii [Oct. 9] Anno 1542.

No. 2953. (Wittenberg.) In October 1542. To the Elector Johann Friedrich. (Missing letter.) 


Intercession for his cousin, Hans Schiitzmeister zu Eisenach, for a dispatch from Eisenach Abbey, in 


to which he had turned his fortune. - The letter is missing until now. The resolution to the sequestrators of Thursday after Galli [Oct. 19] 1542 was that the etc. Schitzmeister 60 fl. from the sequestration fund.

No. 2954. Wittenberg. October 28, 1542. To the Elector Johann Friedrich, jointly with Cruciger and Melanchthon. 


Concerns about a marital case. - By way of explanation, Burkhardt notes: Blesing Hupman, whose wife had given birth before the time, had gone to Zeitz as a result and separated from her. He insisted on divorce, since he could not have married her as a virgin, whereas the defendant claimed that she had already performed the marriage ceremony before the marriage. The consistory and the theologians were of different opinions; the former judged the matter according to the old ecclesiastical law, the theologians based it on Deuteron. The verdict was that the plaintiff had to acknowledge his wife, submit to the punishment of fornication and pay the court costs. 


The original, signed by Luther, Cruciger and Melanchthon and sealed by Luther, is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. O, pag. 509, H 78. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 416. 

God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, beforehand. Most Serene, Highborn, Most Gracious Prince and Lord! After E. C. F. G. has sent us a letter from the highly respected gentlemen appointed to the Consistory, concerning a case in Zeitz, we first ask that E. C. F. G. graciously hear our counter-report, for the gentlemen of the Consistory have answered without our prior knowledge, - which nevertheless surprises us in such an important matter, - and in addition have reported something further than was necessary. For that they say about a disagreement in such a case, how itis to be held, if one takes a pregnant woman for a virgin 2c., nothing has ever gone out by us about this case in writings, but if we are asked for advice, before and after appointment of the Consistorii, we have kept ourselves in it: Firstly, we have admonished and worked that the man keep such a person, who has not broken with him, even now offered to keep himself chaste and honest.

And in this he wanted to consider: first, that she had not broken with him; then also what misery would follow the woman from such abandonment. For if she were to be abandoned, greater evil would ensue from poverty and misery. Therefore, in this case, the husband should show mercy for God's sake, and that customary rights do not separate them; thus, such persons are often kept together. 

However, it also happened with a butcher here at one time that he did not want to keep such a wife and did not accept any admonition. In addition, it has been reported that the man who slept with her also promised to marry her and offered to take her, which we have therefore allowed to happen. As also recently, with our considerable misgivings in the Consistory, such a man was granted a mead, which had otherwise been promised to another, but which had not yet slept with her. 

That the gentlemen in the Consistory also report: we do not suffer them to speak against our doctrine (lahr),-there is no doctrine or article of this matter written by us, as far as we know to remember, and let it remain with this rule that the persons are spoken together, but so that the judge nevertheless considers the circumstances of the cases, and seeks after the same opportunity measure, which may serve the persons for improvement, unity and salvation. For if the divine law Deut. 22 has separated these persons with death, and punished the woman, such women shall not now be left without punishment. For God wants fornication to be punished by the authorities. Also, after such an example, the judge may consider where to make a divorce. 

But we have written clearly and distinctly of other cases, namely, of divorce on account of adultery, item, of abandonment, and that in such cases the innocent person, after interrogation, is again allowed to be free in a Christian way, according to the clear text in Matthew and Paul; item, of other more questions of secret betrothal without the will of the parents. What we have now written about these matters, we consider Christian and necessary and stick to it; 





[It] made 1) also inaccuracy in the churches, if the gentlemen in the Consistorio would speak against it, therefore it would not be sorry for us. This report of ours will be graciously heard by E. C. F. G., from which we also expect that the Reverend Nicolaus, Bishop of Naumburg, will easily conclude with himself what in this case, of which he has written, is to be concluded. God keep E. C. F. G. always. Date Witteberg, 28 Octobris Anno 1542. E. C. F. G. subservient Martinas Luther, Dr. Caspar Creutziger, D.  Philippus Melanthon.

Grace and peace! | thank you, dear man, for wanting to comfort me over the death of my extremely dear daughter. | was indeed fond of her, not only because she was my flesh, but because of her so gentle, quiet manner and her great obedience to me. But now | am glad that she lives with her father in sweetest sleep until that day. And as our times are and will be worse and worse, | desire from the bottom of my heart for me and all mine, also for you and all ours, that we may be given such an hour of departure, with such great faith and gentle rest; that is, in truth, to fall asleep in the Lord, not seeing nor tasting death, nor feeling a hair's breadth of fear. | hope that now is and will be the time of which Isaiah says Cap. 57, 1. 2.: "The righteous are raised up, and come to peace, and rest.

| wish to write to you more often, but | have no messenger and you write very rarely. | easily believe that rumors about Heinz are being spread and threats. Thus your Meissen have become vain, especially through this larva at Merseburg, since they falsify that they are brave, and we fearful. But we despise them. In the matter of the war, there is nevertheless the suspicion that a conflagration might also arise from this noise. May God protect us. | had thought before that only against the Turks nothing would be achieved but losing money and being ridiculed. What would God do through such people? But one must pray persistently that God, by Himself or by the angels, will destroy this beast, as He has done with the Pabst and his alarming hypocrisy and abomination. 

| do not know whether my letter in which | asked whether you had a position for a theology lecturer had reached you before. | had been asked by D. Hieronymus Weller had asked me about it, who also complains about the very great coldness of his Freibergers and the quite icy contempt of the word. But in the meantime, it has occurred to me that this will be done in vain, since everything is not yet in order with you. Be thou confident in the Lord, and be thou strong; for Christ hath willed that thou shouldest sit in that place, lest his enemy should have a place there. You serve Christ just by taking the seat and taking the place of the devil, even if you do nothing else at all times: how much more, since you are not idle, but fight and purge the sins of the people through the word of God. In Him you are quite well. Greetings from my Kathe, who in the meantime is still sobbing at the memory of her extremely obedient daughter. On Sunday after Simonis and Juda [Oct. 29] Anno 1542.

Grace and peace. My dear Leonhard! | believe that the elevation of the Sacrament is free, and | have always held this opinion. But | have never condemned the churches of Saxony, which | knew had the elevation. That is indeed true, that there is no sin on either side. In the beginning, when Carlstadt cried out that the elevation of the sacrament was a crucifixion of Christ, | resisted him and kept the elevation out of contempt against the devil who blasphemed so furiously, otherwise | might have dropped it. Now | let each of the two parts of his mind rule: each may do what he wants and seems suitable to him. That is why | did not want to oppose our bishop and did not want to fight for a cause in which nothing was at stake when he wanted to abolish the elevation. For my part, | would not have cared about it, as | still do not care if the elevation continues. | do not want a sin or a snare of conscience to be made in any piece. Therefore, do what pleases you.

Grace and peace! You write right, my dear Anton, namely that in this very evil time the death, or more correctly the sleep of our children and all of ours is to be wished. And although | was not a little moved by the death of my very dear daughter, | rejoice, since | am sure that she, as a child of the kingdom, torn out of the mouth of the devil and the world, has slumbered so sweetly in faith in Christ. 


All news, especially good news, there is nothing. From Hungary, we have been ridiculed, and just by this, we have lost thirty times a hundred thousand florins and above. "It is finished." Ezekiel said [Cap. 7, 2. 6.], the end is here.

Grace and peace! | hold, my dear Spalatin, that the girl who, no doubt instigated by others, has mocked the Sacrament and the ministry of the Word, should be punished with imprisonment for about a month with meager food, so that she may learn not to blaspheme, as an example to others. 

With the elevation of the sacrament you may do as you please. | do not want any rope to be laid in these neutral things. So | write, | have written and | will write to all who bother me daily with this question.

Concerns about whether the Protestants, who were in the minority both in the council and in the citizens of Metz, should be accepted into the Schmalkaldic League? Luther refuted this. Cf. Seckendorf, Hist. Luth. lib. Ill, p. 599.

It is true that one potentate may help another in right matters, and may also unite for this purpose, as John says: as Christ died for us, so we are obliged to lay down out lives for our brothers, but each according to his state and profession: a preacher differently from a prince; a private person differently from a potentate; and it would be a vain thing if a private person from Germany wanted to run to France to save the poor Christians there against the rulers. For such works have their order and their measure, namely the office and possibility. Potestat should protect, but as far as possible, as Christ says [Luc. 11, 41]: Give eleemosyns from yours that you have, i.e. not higher than you are able. Subjects are to follow, preachers are to confirm their confession with their suffering, a private person, if it is made in particular, is to confess. There have also always been covenants on earth between saints and the wicked; but there has always been great driving, and the hardest wars on earth have been caused by covenants, as between Carthage and Rome, between Athens and Sparta 2c. Abraham protected Sodoma as a neighbor and saved his brother, and was right in doing so; Solomon had an alliance with Hiram; Constantinus protected the Christians against Licinium, with whom he otherwise had an alliance, but was right in resisting public tyranny; Theodosius protected the young Valentinianum against pagan practices, and was right 2c. On the other hand, covenants are often made among God's people, not only among pagans, who displeased God and did not prosper, as Israel and Judah clung to Egypt, then to Syria, then to Babylon, and yet they were not helped. For the heart must first be united with God, 


2803 


and not rely solely on human help. So it is also more proper that the state should unite with the state in right matters than with private individuals, as with a part of the city, since the latter part may take cause from this to let in foreign people and to cause riots and murder. However, it is right for a government to help poor private individuals against public tyranny, if possible. But we have often seen how it is with foreign nations, England and France, and the same people are full of practices, and do not mean one thing they pretend, but seek all other advantages besides. Where the hearts are not equal in reason, and not directed to God, unstable alliances are always formed, as experience shows; and it is very much to be feared that the Popes in Metz will cause a riot by bringing foreign people into the city 2c. Lotharing, Burgundy and the French have a good mind to do so, as it is known that the Lotharingians, over promised peace, 1) miserably killed 20,000 men in the peasants’ clamor without need, and Lotharing and Burgundy will move much more easily, since the city is still divided, so that they can set foot in the city, and will pretend to save the oppressed party. 

From all this it is easy to assume that it is much more annual to make an alliance with a part of the city than with the whole city. Therefore, the lords, who by the grace of God are themselves of high intellect and know the occasion much better than we do, want to consider for themselves: that it is strange and out of the ordinary to make an alliance with a part of a city; item, that it entails much more trouble and may give the city itself cause for unrest; item, how it is possible for us to save it; item, one must also consider here that one will have to deal with Lotharing, Burgundy and France. But we put all this to God, and ask the gentlemen themselves to think about how to moderate this action, so that those at Metz are not left without comfort.

About the marriage of Franz Zulsdorf. - After the banns had been issued, since the wedding was to take place in Cranach's house the next day, the Elector received a colored report in which objections were raised against this marriage. The Elector immediately wrote to the Consistory and to Luther, who immediately gave him this answer.

G. u. F. in Christo and my poor pater noster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious [Sir]! | have read E. C. F. G.'s writing Franz Zilstorf's half to the gentlemen of the Consistorii. Thereupon | humbly inform E. C. F. G. that it seems to me that such a report was ordered to E. C. F. G. from a malicious mind, because he kept silent for so long after being summoned, until it was indeed sent 1) on the wedding day, to the poor man's scorn and great harm. And what is even worse, E. C. F. G. was not informed that I, D. Martinus, together with the theologians and church servants pronounced the verdict in place of our pastor, as an honorable councilor will receive a copy from me, and perhaps send it to E. C. F. G.. For | have acted long and diligently in this matter, and would much rather have denied than granted the mead to Zulsdorf, where | would have had the right to do so. But since | searched a lot, it turned out that Franz had done everything behind his father's knowledge and will. It is said that three virgins were betrothed to him. But none of them wanted to confess or admit it. A widow in LUbeck had him addressed, since the council in Luibeck answered my three writings three times and sent testimony that 2) a betrothal had taken place, but they did not have his father's knowledge or will, which | personally heard from his mouth at his deathbed, which also showed me letters and seals that Doctor Briicke saw. 


1) "has" put by us instead of: "until"; otherwise "until" would have to be deleted here. 2) These letters are all missing (Burkhardt). 





Franz was also punished by the honorable council for such a transgression, and | ordered him, according to the gospel, to give the widow in Lubeck such a great insult, or he should not go to church. | had to pronounce such a sentence to remedy the matter, because our pastor was not at home, and the Consistory could not do anything either, regardless of the person, as we often have to be the Consistory's stopgap, which we would rather be exempt from. Herewith E. C. F. G. has the right report. Please, therefore, let E. C. F. G. give that false reporter a proper answer to his false reporting and dangerous silence of other circumstances.

But | ask you very kindly: for Christ's sake, be patient until | can talk to him, which, | trust, will not be long delayed. However, help us to bear the cross, as we truly bear, get and work much beyond all measure.

So you have to consider that such an old servant of the Electors of Saxony, and now an experienced man, does not want to hurry us with sharp writings, to prevent further unhappiness and unrest. Thus the article, indicated in the note, is put in such words that it may easily be interpreted as if it were not a compulsory act.

Venice. November 26, 1542. 


The friars of the church at Venice, Vicenza and Trevigo to Luther. (Regest.) 

In this letter, written by Balthasar Alterius (the secretary of the English ambassador in Venice), they pay their respects to Luther, as the champion of the holy gospel, and apologize for not having expressed it in a letter long ago, which they are now forced to do by necessity, since Christians are being persecuted. They ask Luther, through the Protestant princes of Germany, to influence the Council of Venice to suspend the persecution until a council is held. They deplore the fierce sacramental controversy, which, brought there from Germany, has also aroused unrest and discord among them and has done harm to the Church of God. Finally, they ask for news about the religious movements in Germany and express their desire for Luther's writings, which are unbelievably distributed to them by the dishonesty and greed of the booksellers to the detriment of the church. - Luther replied to this letter in great detail on June 13, 1543.

K6nigsberg. November 29, 1542. 


Johann Brismann to Luther. (Regest.) 


Since Lohmiller was traveling to Germany, he did not want him to leave without a letter to Luther. He reports about Gerhard Westerburg, 3) Doctor of Laws, from Cologne, who had sought a position in the schools to be established in Ké6nigsberg, especially a lecture in theology; now he had also come to the court of the prince. Brismann had already seen Westerburg 20 years ago in Carlstadt's house, when the enthusiasts from Zwickau, Stork and Marcus, were coming and going. Afterwards, Westerburg married the sister of Carlstadt's wife in the village of Segren near Wittenberg. Even today, he is full of annoying opinions and superstitious errors, such as the preaching of the gospel in the underworld and the purification of the souls of Christians in purgatory. Also many other ungodly errors were in a confession of faith, which he had handed over to the Duke of Prussia. However, he knows how to cunningly conceal and cover up his errors, just like the fanatics in Silesia. Therefore Brismann prays: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has graciously preserved us and our churches in Prussia from M[artin] Cellarius, from the false prophets of the Silesians and the Dutch, may he save them from this drunken Westerburg, who has drunk and blasphemed the ungodly errors of Muenzer, Stork, Marcus, Zwingli, Sebastian Frank, Carlstadt, and all the enthusiasts, may he also graciously deign to deliver us and our church, and especially our prince, Amen."

To the highly famous man, Mr. Justus Jonas, Doctor of Theology, Servant and Messenger of Christ at Halle ill Saxony, Provost in Wittenberg, his extremely dear [friend] in the Lord. 


Grace and peace! That | did not answer your two letters, my dear Jonas, - | had to think that | had written before what my opinion would be. For you wrote that Frischmuth had also allegedly acted against the council, so that he was detained. Now, if he has no other guilt on him than that he has sinned against the bishop, and you cannot drive back force with force, or undo one trick with another, then it is done for him. For | will easily avenge and defend myself. But if these furies of insatiable vindictiveness should have even one thing, that a hair has been lifted from the alley, they will not cease to want to sate their insatiable mind on you and yours. Therefore, if you lack counsel against violence, how can | have it? But | believed that the prisons were under the right of the council, which could release the prisoners against the will of the bishop, if he wanted to convict an accused or guilty person. If you now dare nothing, then | for my part will easily defend my note 1). But he who leaves you full will not be freed by this, but driven more into a corner. That is my opinion. Therefore, | have thought it good not to follow your advice, so that | do not want to burden the poor man any more, as he will indeed be burdened if | take revenge sooner.

The example is easy to take away. The flesh has no consolation here, one must go to the spirit that it has preceded us in a happy course to the one who has called us all and will also lead us through to Himself at His blessed hour from this misery and wickedness of the world, amen. In the meantime, may you, | beseech you, bear sorrow in such a way (for there is cause for it) that you remember our common Christian lot, that however much we may be separated according to the flesh by the exceedingly hard separation, we shall nevertheless one day in that life see ourselves united and gathered together in the sweetest union with the One who so loved us that by His own blood and death He brought about this life for us. We die, but we live, as Paul says [2 Tim. 2:11]. And it is well with us if we fall asleep in pure faith in the Son of God. This truly means that your better mercy transcends life. Dear, how far from this glory and comfort are the Turks, the Jews and those who are worse than these, the Papists, the Cardinals, Heinz and Meinz, who should mourn so that they would not have to mourn for eternity. We, who are sad for a little while, will receive inexpressible joy, to which your Kathe and my Magdalena with many others have gone ahead of us and call, admonish and entice us daily to follow. For who does not finally become disheartened by the monstrosities of examples in this world? if it must otherwise be called a world and not the hell of wickedness itself, with which these sodomites torment our souls and our eyes day and night. And they grieve, as we read that it happened with Noah, the Holy Spirit, so that he also repented of the whole creature, which at the same time groans with us with inexpressible sighs for the redemption of itself and of ours, which will shortly be heard by him who knows and understands these sighs, amen.

Grace and peace! | have not written for a long time, my dear Amsdorf, because | always hoped that | would come to you once. Now that you write that the people of Meissen are disturbed and angry that their hope has deceived them in Wolfenbittel, by which they indicate that they agree with the furious works of that man: so may God find them, and he will find them as he found this one, and even the harmful people will not escape his judgment. Dear one, do not let it grieve you that you are forced to suffer the splendor of a court and a prince; you are not to blame for it. And God knows your heart, which highly detests such splendor and _ splendor. But remember the exceedingly godly Queen Esther, who against her will wore the crown of the kingdom of the Persians, calling it a showpiece and a stained garment; but for the sake of the king and the kingdom she wore it. And Christ did not ask for the splendor on Palm Day, but suffered it; meanwhile he himself was poor and constantly killed and crucified. But the glory was God's. So you also do right, and you are completely crucified to Christ and killed with him, since you call that courtly splendor and splendor your prison. That means, in fact, to use this world as if you did not need it, and only to serve God under this guise. This is not what the papists and the wicked do, for whom these trappings are not prisons.

Hail! There is something very beautiful about the order of the celestial movements, which produces the most important forces for the living beings, by bringing back the sun during the day, by allowing rest at night, by moistening the earth in spring, so that it receives the seeds and becomes fertile, by increasing the heat in summer, so that the fruits can reach maturity. But no less to be admired is the beauty of the order in the world regime, if once a good prince directs the same. For he brings the assemblies of people into harmony, and makes them praise God, practice virtue, love proper customs, instruct the youth, defend and assist the righteous, and suppress the rage of the wicked. Such a ruler is the image of God on earth and is protected and promoted by God Himself. He does not have enemies as satellites who persecute the people of the princes, but angels of God as servants; it is certain that godly princes are surrounded by hosts of them. But although such princes are rare, like that one

Therefore it behooves you to make every effort to obey your father's will and to work so that one day your characters, manners and examples will shine in the government and adorn you and the whole civil society. On the other hand, consider what an abominable and cursed thing is such a prince as Caligula, Nero, and their like, who were tainted with patricide and every kind of infamy, who lived among men, not as images of God, but as furies of the devil, and defiled the whole order of the world with their shameful deeds. | also pray to God, the Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, who loves good princes most of all, to govern you and to grant that your virtue may one day bring salvation to the Church and the Fatherland. | feel immense joy when | hear that some prince is praised with truth, and again | know no sadder spectacle than when | see that some lead an evil course, who are a pestilence to the church and to all mankind. Therefore, | wish in truth and with all my heart that God will constantly help you, govern you and keep you. Anno 1542.

People are rude. The world is ungrateful. 

Therefore, after my death, my Kathe or my children shall hold before the council and city (where a Pharaoh would arise who did not want to know about Joseph): 

First, that they have from me a large space on the alley in front of my door, which has been the monastery's, as far 5) as the Rymer's little house at the gate reaches out, and up to the end of Braunen's 6) hall. 

On the other hand, that they got the whole space of this house, after my death, and Brown House before, under the civil law, which all had been completely free before. 

Third, that | have been a preacher for thirty years, taking nothing from them for wages, and giving little but several thousand bricks or lime, and thus serving them from mine, often remaining with them in the pestilence. 

Therefore, they may beware of ingratitude, or they will have little happiness. 

My hand. 

3) After the preceding, read "60", not "66", which Seidemann Offers. 

4) This is written in the margin on the first page. 

5) Here Luther deleted the words: "when the garden breaks out at the brewhouse (prawhaus), and well". 

6) The bill of sale about Bruno Braun's house at Wittenberg (he was pastor at Dobin near Wittenberg), which was sold by him to Luther on June 29, 1541, is in the handwritten Actis Lutherorum, col. 10. 11. on the city library at Leipzig. 


2822 


If after my death | would be asked where the monastery's household utensils had gone, | should answer: 

First 

The pewter vessels and kitchen utensils with other household goods were given to me by the Visitatores. But in the beginning of the Gospels it is so destroyed that | would not have wanted to give 20 fl. for the rest that was given to me. To this day, | have not ceased to grind away jugs, bowls, spits, pots, 1) and whatever anyone could grab, and mine too. 

For this, | have been charged annually and put in the common box IX old 8?) and what more is due to a preacher. | have therefore served the church, city and university for the sake of God and free of charge for 15 years, with preaching, reading, writing, etc., and | have been well satisfied with what | have done, that M. G.**" Lord has also given me free of charge, out of grace, even for the sake of God. For S. C. F. G. has not been guilty of providing the church and city with such expenses for their preacher. 

So | must praise this for the sake of evil, ungrateful people. For | can well see how poorly | will be thanked after my death, since some are sorry that they do not have what God has given me, and they have given nothing in addition. So that one can shut the mouth of such evil, ungrateful people and make them ashamed. Otherwise, several citizens and the university have shown me all virtue and honor, for which | thank them sincerely, and God will reward them well. 


On the other hand 

The church ornaments and equipment, although much and the best of it had come, | have finally sold the best casels that were available; not much over fifty guilders got for it, so that | clothed, fed and supplied the nuns and monks (thieves and peelers among them), with such great benefit that | have added my own and 100 fl., which M. G. H., Duke Hans, gives me for housekeeping, quite avidly. 


1) "groppen" == iron or earthen cooking pot with feet. 

Seidemann's explanation: "shovel, hoe, digging stick" is wrong. 2) Perhaps: "nine old shocks"? That would be 9 gulden 21 groschen.

Therefore, no one is to be credited or detracted from in this, especially not my Kathe. She has nothing to gain from this but the greatest damage. But what she has now, she has begotten herself besides me. If someone makes a quarrel against her, he will not do itas a pious man, but as a Heinz of Wolfenbittel, and God will know how to find him, amen. My hand. 





Anno 3) 

The town council has lent me stones and lime several times. 

When | now often asked for an invoice and offered to pay, they always said that no one was allowed to pay; until the mayor, Mr. Krappe, and the town clerk, Urban, verbally indicated to me that everything should be bad. So | have also at that time and want to have thanked herewith kindly. 

But if they would forget it with the time and demand payment, then my Kathe or children must hold out, and take my thanks again to themselves. Haec autem 1542. post et alia, mutuo dedit. 


Anno 1536. 

| helped Greger Tischer (Tyschen) buy his little house for a hundred guilders. 

The first Augift | gave for him, namely 40 fl. Derselbigen 20 of my Solde and 20 of Moritz 4) borrowed, which | gave him back the same year. 

With the other 20 fl. | directed Greger Tischer to the common chest, to whom | owed 20 fl. and paid with it. He is to work off the other 20 for me. 

Moritz has put up the following fl. for me, namely 

{ XX fl. Anno 1538 { X fl. Anno 1539 { X fl. Anno 1540 { X fl. Anno 1541 X fl. Anno 1542 myself.

(Wittenberg.)January 4. January 1543. To Laurentius Rudel in Amberg, 


Andreas Huiigel, who had come to Amberg on Luther's recommendation, had had to leave Amberg because the Protestant service was suppressed by the papists, and we find him already in 1541 as Diaconus in Wittenberg (Seidemann in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 514, note 3). When later the service was again permitted, albeit only in silence, Rudel took its place. However, he was disturbed by the Catholic priest in the exercise of his office and was therefore inclined to leave his position. Luther resented this. 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 401. Printed in Schitze, vol.I, p.247 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 526. German in Schenk''s Chronik von Amberg, p. 215. 


Grace and peace! M. Andreas Higel, the elder (presbyter) of our church, has asked me, my dear Laurentius, to admonish you by letter in the Lord that you should not leave the service of the word in the church at Amberg, which | do not do unwillingly, especially since | learn that you are loved and desired by the people. Indeed, | hear that you are not unreasonably upset because the priest has disgraced you by keeping you from performing the baptism by trickery, but it is up to us to recognize the tricks of the devil and to make an effort that we do not give way to evil, but overcome evil with good, but not be overcome. Satan is intent on something much different than driving you away from the performance of baptism, for he has set his sights on extinguishing the Word by your departure. A 


How much less of an evil it is not to baptize than not to preach. Therefore, | ask you for Christ's sake to prevent future remorse and not to grant Satan this triumph so that he can laugh. For he will clap his hands and rejoice when he has cast you out of the service of the word through the false 1) church, and escapes in his wickedness. Therefore, send thyself to overcome and disgrace his attempts by patience, and thwart his glory and triumph. This will bring you comfort and joy later on. Then you will be safe and will not have to suffer any tears of remorse, which you would have brought upon yourself by impatience. May the Lord guide your heart so that you may realize that my counsel is beneficial for you, amen. January 4, Anno 1543. Your Martin Luther. 


No. 2982. (Wittenberg.)January 4. January 1543. To Spalatin in Altenburg. 


Luther only wants to give him oral information about what has been written to him concerning Spalatin (cf. No. 2962). About an economic matter. 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 400, printed in Schutze, vol. |, p. 246 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 527. 


To the highly famous man, Magister Georg Spalatin, the extremely faithful overseer and bishop of the churches in Meissen, his very dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! That you desire from me, dear Spalatin, that | may inform you what has been written to me or by which people about you, | have decided that it must be postponed until we can talk to each other. For so | have also answered those who have written. | do this so that a word may not slip from the absent pen that cannot be made good. The matter is not great, so | rather try to extinguish the spark than to turn it into a flame.

as the Lord says, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Otherwise, there will be enough discord and agitation and unrest. Meanwhile, | beseech thee, act according to thy prudence in a patient and calm manner, and be not provoked by the words of any until | have spoken with thee. That is enough. 

My Lord Kathe is sending a wagon to take down the remaining trees, as you know. She asks you very much not to feel burdened if your help or advice should be needed. We all pray that this new year may be a blessed one for you and yours in the Lord, amen. January 4, Anno 1543.

He humbly apologized and exalted your person, complaining at the same time that he had perhaps been given more unfair treatment by others than he deserved. | countered him with what you had written to me, and | to you. He most decidedly denied that he had said such things that had been brought against him, and therefore asked that | at least obtain this from you, that you would not believe anyone, however many and great people there might be, if he could not first, called and heard, speak freely what his opinion was. This | promised him so surely that | even accused him of never having asked this of you. But | will be brief. You will do it, that you hear him. We have advised him that he should not do any of these things alone (per se) until the visitation. 

But | understood this with sadness from his narration, since he himself did not notice that nothing was yet established or ordered, not even for the Consistory, of which | firmly believed that it had already been in full activity for a long time. 1) | am annoyed by the negligence of our court, which boldly misses so many things, and afterwards, when we are thrown into the muck, snores idly and leaves us in the lurch. | will open the ears of D.

Now it is true that such an evil clamor of his absence arose everywhere that the lords of the university could not well do otherwise than to counter the annoying rumor, to suspend him from his position and office until several days had passed, and also to report it to E. C. F. G. so that it would not become worse. Now, however, after the previous suspension, he allowed himself to be interrogated, and the matter was not found to be so bad, everything turned out well again, so that he was released from his suspension, and enough happened everywhere. Thereupon he asked me to humbly ask E. C. F. G. for him, that E. C. F. G. would also graciously drop such a disgrace, and graciously let him follow the lection and pay as before. Because | have experienced myself that in this matter such a rumor and cause of the university for such a suspension 


1) Curio had the reputation of being on terms with women. A public slander would bring him into violent conflict with Caspar Teuschel and Pucher, on the open street as well as in the former's apartment (Burkhardt).

To M. Martin Gilbert, preacher in Marienberg. 


Luther gives him advice on how to deal with those who have deposed a preacher without authorization. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. 186. 4. Printed in Litterar. Wochenbl. Il, 312; from the Léscher collection in Dresden in Schiitze, vol. |, p. 252; in Strobel- Ranner, x. 308 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 532 f. 

To the worthy man, M. Martin Gilbert, the servant of Christ in Marienberg, his brother who is exceedingly dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace! What should | advise you otherwise, my dear Martin, than what the Lord himself taught in Matth. 18, that is, that you first go to those who exercise this tyranny to depose the preacher, and remind them privately that it is not in their power to depose or appoint preachers, but with those who are commanded to do so either by a superior or by God. Now if they want to depose, they may depose those who feed and appoint them from their money. They are servants of the money given to the church or to Christ, not masters, so that they may use it as they please. For none of them would suffer his neighbor to throw out of his house even 1) the servant of another, since it is not his house nor even his property. Therefore they should know that they are thieves, but rather robbers of God, if they throw out a strange servant, namely Christ's, and give strange money to a stranger. They may do what they like with their money, but they should not give money to strangers. If they do not repent in this matter, consider them pagans, who are also not worthy to serve the church treasury, whose masters they want to be. Other things you can consider yourself, and the Spirit will give them to you. Fare well. January 24, 1543, MLL.

Grace and peace! These days | have suffered from my head, my dear Jonas, so that | could neither read nor write. And even now | must not burden myself with many things, so | have not been able to read your translation sufficiently. | believe that you are becoming more distressed from day to day, since, now that the torpor is receding, you are beginning to feel more desire for the exceedingly lovely company of your very good wife. But it must be borne what cannot be changed. And he who is the Savior of God [Luc. 1, 47.] will also heal this wound of yours, amen. 

There is no news here, except that from all parts of the world the worst rumors are spreading about the Margrave of Brandenburg because of the war waged in Hungary. And there is no better talk about Ferdinand himself. There are so many, and indeed probable, reasons of proof, to such an extent that | can hardly refrain from believing myself that everything was carried out with a frightening and exceedingly ruinous treacherousness, and that God alone prevented that something even worse did not happen.

Grace and peace in the Lord. (Strictly?) Wise, dear gentlemen, good friends! | have recently written to you, Captain, and asked that you let your pastor come from you in kindness. For | did not hear the things differently, as if he had acted wrongly and had been deposed by the Visitatoribus. Now | am told by the visitators that he has not committed any offense, nor do they want to have him deposed, nor do they want to have him deposed, but they give him testimony that he is pure in doctrine and unpunishable in life, but if you have cast a grudge against him, that he has severely punished the vices, therefore you intend to depose him. From this | realize that here the devil would like to cause misfortune and lead you into great harm, which moves me to do this writing to you, and | ask you very kindly to accept it amicably (as | faithfully mean) for your good. 


Georg Spenlein, because he had often been guilty of unseemly outbursts in the pulpit against individuals as well as against the municipal regiment. Especially in these: Especially in these years, Spenlein had wielded the scourge against the disorderly life of individuals, and allowed himself expressions that may have been too strong even in the face of the rough customs of that time. Thus he did not refrain from calling the riflemen, who did not attend church on Sundays because of late children's lessons, because they otherwise could not come to shoot, and who were still drinking late, "long revengers, thieves and treacherous villains". He asked in the sermon: "Let the plumb line" (lead) "go out to the bushes and shoot them in the mouth, wet and head", and if this did not happen, "let them die a lingering death" 2c. There was a whole register of such remarks, which prompted the council to remove the preacher and ask for the appointment of another.

| hope you will have so much Christian understanding that a ministry, a preaching office and the gospel are not ours, nor of any man, nor of any angel, but of God our Lord alone, who purchased it for us with his blood, gave it to us and endowed it for our salvation. Therefore He judges the despisers harshly and says (Luc. 10,16.): "He who despises you despises Me"; and it would have been better for him if he had never heard it, says St. Peter, 2 Epist. 2, 21. 

Because the two excellent men, Mr. Jobst and Mr. Friedrichs) Visitatores, who must give account for it, both testify, and one must believe them that your pastor teaches the right, pure word of God, and is honest life, which also the city Creuzburg and neighbors testify: Behold, dear lords and friends, how the evil spirit seeks you so cunningly and maliciously, that you should offend the supreme pastor and bishop, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who, out of great and special grace, communicates to you his Word and Sacrament, that is, his blood, death and suffering, so purely and abundantly through his Irish, pious servant, your pastor; how the wicked devil cannot suffer that you should be saved! 

So you also have to consider this, because there is no other cause and guilt, than that you have cast a grief on him, without his merit, even for his great merit and faithful preaching, that it is not to be done nor possible zero, for the sake of your grief and wrongful presumption, to do violence and injustice to such a well-respected pastor, and to throw him with dirt. | cannot blame the visitators that they do not do such things, nor do they want to weigh down their consciences with such injustice for the devil's sake, and go to the devil with you (where they approved of your authority). Be careful, dear lords and friends, be careful: if the devil brings you to this case, he will not leave it at that, but will continue to fall. 

This case is that you should despise and hate your pastor without cause, that is, despise Christ himself, the chief of all pastors: then you will strike yourselves against the stone,

and burn them in the consuming fire. For he is more interested in a faithful, pure pastor than in all such unbelievers, officials, mayors, judges, or even in the whole world with all its authority, power and honor. For their office (where they are not Christians) serves him nothing for his kingdom of heaven, as the parish office does, nor has it been bought so dear (with his blood) as the parish office. With this case he brings it to the point that he closes your heart and mouth, so that you do not believe, do not pray, do not praise, 1) nor do you lift up your hanpt before God in any trouble, as he says Matth. 5, 24: Leave your sacrifice and make atonement for yourself first. With that you would no longer be Christians, you would have banished and condemned yourselves; that would be terrible. 

After that he will work it so that he will overthrow your own sin with great foreign sins, namely, that you should oust your innocent pastor, so that the church will become desolate, and children and other pious people will remain deprived of the word, baptism or sacrament, and, as much as is beyond you, must also be damned with you. That would be much worse than the pope's rule; how will you answer for that? Moreover, if the common man and the dear youth would see such a horrible example, that learned, pious priests would be rewarded for their effort and faithful service with dirt and shame, who would want to send a child to school? Who wants to study with his food? Where are we going to get parish priests? 

Yes, this damage the devil seeks through such your and your like's willfulness. How much better it would be to be under the troublesome pope and Turks, since there are still schools and churches left for pastors and preachers, neither among you, who want to make it so desolate. 

Thirdly, if you fail to do so, he will at last cast you into hardened impenitence: then it is all over with you, and no more counsel; yes, this is how the wretched devil deals with you. Therefore, the sooner you get along with the priest and the church, that is, with Christ, the better, lest you also become an example, as has already happened to some. 

Surely there are other ways to be found. Those who do not hear the priest zero, the 


1) Burkhardt: "live". 





If the door of the church is open, he may remain outside without God's grace. The churches are not built, nor the parishes established, to push out those who want to teach and hear the Word of God, and to keep in those who do not want to hear the Word of God; but they are built and established for the sake of those who like to hear it and cannot do without it. 

You are not lords over the parishes and the preaching ministry, you did not establish them, but only the Son of God; you have not given anything to them, much less the right to them, neither the devil in the kingdom of heaven, you shall not master them nor teach them, neither shall you refuse to punish them. For it is God's and not man's punishment, who wants it unpunished, but commanded; wait for your office, and let God be satisfied with his regiment, before he has to teach it to you). Yours is none that can suffer a stranger to leave or chase away his servant, whom he cannot spare. Yes, there is no shepherd boy so small that he would suffer a crooked word from a foreign master; only God's servant should and must be everyone's servant, and suffer everything from everyone, whereas one does not want to or cannot suffer anything from him, not even God's own word. 

Such admonition, | ask you to understand amicably, which | mean faithfully; for it is God's admonition. But if you will not hear, nor amend your ways, we must let you go, and yet see how we may resist the devil, at least so far as not to weigh down our consciences with your sins, nor to will the devil therein. 

We must not put you under ban; you are harming yourselves, since we would like and much prefer to have you out. And even if you could get another pastor, since there is still a long way to go, you still cannot become the earliest, nor can you partake of some piece of Christian grace and life; so no one will accept it against the will and command of the visitators. And who would have me among such disowned Christians, who would have such evil cries, that they would betray their pastor with violence and injustice, and yet call themselves Christians, and lead such a holy name with dishonor?

If you were to do this, you would become a beautiful name all over the world and quite an example. 

Finally, | counsel in Christ, make peace with your pastor and live peaceably with him: let him punish, teach, comfort, as he is commanded by God, and as is on his conscience; according to the saying Ebrews 13:17: Obey your rulers (pastors), for they must give account for you. For that which you are about to do is an evil example, that any magistrate, judge, or alderman should want to expel a priest at his own whim, because he has no right, no authority, and no property; God will not and cannot suffer it. 

May God grant that you may not know it, but may the same dear God help you to know His will with fear and humility, and honor His Son, that is, His word, which He has given and redeemed for you through His blood, and His servants, the poor parish priests, who are otherwise quite afflicted, and should have protection and comfort from you worldly rulers, so that your ministry may become a service of God.

But if | could direct this matter according to my wishes, | would prefer that you follow your own way in these matters in your own area. For if we begin to make all things equal, these things will become articles of faith and cords everywhere, as they were under the Pabstacy; but if they are unequal, this will be a very wholesome remedy against this evil. Thus, under the papacy, it was of great benefit that it was not considered 2) that a church should be equal to the Roman church, but that each one should follow its own customs without a rope of conscience. For if equality and conformity in the most important things and in the main thing, that is, in doctrine, remain inviolate, then consenting to unequal outward ceremonies will be easy, just as, if head and body are equally healthy, the diversity of works in the various members will not cause discord in the body, yes, rather a beautiful harmony of different voices, as in music.

C. F. G. is ready to do). C. F. G. has done), that they would not suffer fornication, neither of high nor low. Truly the devil seeks us, that we must pray and be humble; otherwise we are lost.

Nuremberg. . February 16, 1543. 


Veit Dietrich to Luther. 


Dietrich reports on the death of Eck and Cardinal Contarenus. 


This letter, as far as it concerns Eck's death, can be found in Seckendorf, Hist. Luth. Ill, 468. As Burkhardt, p. 422, states, copies of it are in the Dessau Archives and in Cod. chart. Goth. Further, in the Unschuldige Nachrichten 1707, p. 821 and in the Fortgesetzten Sammlung, 1739, p. 136, and inVita. 

Langeri, pag, 230. We let follow here what Seckendorf offers, translated into German. 


| believe that you have heard about Eck's death. He died on the tenth of February 1) at noon. He lay sick about seven days. At first a fever seized him; when he cured this in his usual way by frequent drinking, the malady increased, so much so that his friends exhorted him to confession and communion. But for a while in vain. Finally, madness was added. Therefore they summoned a monk to say mass at the bedside. As he murmured the usual abominations of the canon, Eck began to exclaim: "If we now had the 4000 gilden, we would have found a council for this matter! And yet, while he was so caught up in madness, he was given communion. Shortly after, the falling sickness followed, which deprived him not only of all his other senses, but also of the use of his tongue. Everything that was said was spoken to a stone, and it did not help that the monks murmured incomprehensible psalms at the bedside. Finally, a third disease was added, which is also found in wine- bibbers and lewd people, and so he spat out the soul at the same time as the flower. This is what Weigler told me, for his friends report otherwise, for they are ashamed of such a heinous death in their defender. He responded to Bucer's second writing; it is said to be an exceedingly poisonous book. Bucer had written somewhere that Eck was dead. On the title of the book Eck wrote these words: Truly, 2) Eck lives! When the book was finished in Ingolstadt and went out, Eck began to get sick and stopped living. This is not something merely natural in a blasphemous person. 


1) The "fragment about Eck's death", which Seidemann reported in De Wette, Vol. VI, p.343, is certainly not from a letter of Luther, because there decima Macij (sic) is given as the day of Eck's death.

To Albrecht, Duke of Prussia. 


This letter, in which Luther gives his opinion on the elevation of the sacrament, is prompted by the request of Speratus, Bishop of Pomesania, No. 2969. In an insert Luther asks for an extension of the scholarship for a student. 


From Faber's collection of letters, p.44, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 541 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 53. 


G. u. F. and my poor Pr. nr. Serene, highborn Prince, gracious Lord! That E. F. G., also Doctor Speratus, Bishop Pozamienus, 1) wrote to me, requesting my opinion on the elevation of the Sacrament, | have well heard; but because | had much to write, that | would have needed three scribes, E. F. G. graciously wanted to accept this writing, as well as to answer the bishop and all others, as E. F. G. will undoubtedly know to deliver it to them. 

We have done away with elevation in our churches, and | would gladly do away with it, solely so that such ceremonies would not have to be our masters, as if it were a sin to do otherwise. For we Christians want and must be masters of such ceremonies, so that they do not grow over our heads as articles of faith, but must be subject to us and serve us when, where, how and for how long we want. For the ceremonies have always caused heartache through the devil's cunning and human carelessness, that they wanted to be articles of faith, and made the church into a charade, as we have experienced in the papacy. For if it came to the point that elevation would again be necessary to avoid heresy or other things, we wanted to establish it again. In sum, we want and must be servants of the faith (that is, of God), we want to be masters of the ceremonies, and not let them become like the faith; but that one preaches this diligently to the people, so that they do not think that one wants to teach new faith every hour. For the people have no distinction between faith and ceremonies, just as the pope himself has no distinction in this respect, and indeed no distinction between the spiritual and the secular.

Wittenberg. February 20, 1543. Facultatszeugm8 for D. Johann Marbach. 


Marbach received, against the rule, which required an age of thirty years, already with twenty-three years the theological doctorate in Wittenberg. He had been Luther's housemate and table companion, had served for a year in the diaconate in Jena and in Isny as a preacher, and was to be employed there, but went back to Wittenberg, where he disputed under Luther's chairmanship in 1543 and received his doctorate. He was then called to Isny to take the place of Father Fagius, but since he found obstacles there, he went to Strasbourg as assistant to Father Fagius at the Nicolai Church, where he soon received the pastorate. He succeeded Caspar Hedio in the position of antist, and played an important role in the history of the Reformation. He was also a delegate to the Worms discussion in 1547.

Martin Luther, Doctor of Theology, Dean of the College of the Theological Faculty, wishes salvation to all who will read this letter. 

Doctor Johann Marbach from Lindau has requested a certificate from us about his manners, his studies and his [doctoral] degree. We have issued this to him with the greatest willingness because of his virtue and erudition. For we know that he lived in our school, where he spent three whole years, in such a way that all professors praise his modesty and his special diligence in every fulfillment of duty. And that is why two years ago he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts by the Collegium of the Faculty of Liberal Arts. However, since he highly desired that his studies serve the glory of God and the benefit of the church, he diligently listened to the exegetes of the prophetic and apostolic scriptures, also researched antiquity and the disputes of all lines in the church, so that he might obtain the original and true doctrine of the gospel. He therefore accepts the pure doctrine of the Gospel, which our church confesses in one spirit and with one voice with the general church of Christ, and abhors the opinions that dispute with it. However, he has publicly stated his opinion about the muted doctrine, not only in the discussions at school, but also in a public church office, which he administered for some time. Therefore, since the church at Isny, which called him to teach the gospel, desired that we adorn him with the theological [doctoral] dignity for public testimony, we granted the wish of this church. Because we only knew that this Johann Marbach leads an honorable and godly life and understands the concept of Christian doctrine correctly, and accepts the pure gospel, which shines in our churches, and is not tainted with false opinions: so that our testimony about him would be present, we have granted him the dignity of Doctor of Theology, and ask the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His immeasurable goodness preserves the remnants of His church, and adds gifts, so that the light of the gospel may not

that is, teachers and shepherds, that he also instruct and guide them by his Holy Spirit, so that their ministry may be effective and salvific. Since he has asked us to ask for this, we do not doubt that these wishes will be heard. But we admonish him, Doctor Johann Marbach, and his church, that they take care that the gospel is faithfully preserved among their own. For God demands that He be honored primarily through this service, as Christ says [John 15:8]: "In this My Father is honored, that you bear much fruit, and become My disciples." Let us therefore faithfully render this service to God, and not allow ourselves to be drawn away from the Gospel even by the judgment and raging of the godless multitudes in the world, but rather praise the name of the Son of God, and await God's help and eternal life together with the holy fathers, prophets and apostles, through whom God has revealed Himself in glorious and clear testimonies.

May the Lord, who began his work through you, complete it. What you write about the use of the sacrament, that it is certainly desired by all, but it is opposed by the edict of the king and the bishops: if they were so strong in faith that they dared to prefer the will of God to the will of men, | would have them do it. Perhaps the Senate, since it does not forbid it, but lets it happen, will easily have something with which it can excuse itself to the king, namely that it is not its office either to govern or to change the administration (ministoria == the exercise of the preaching ministry) in the churches, that is, to teach GOD. For since in former times the king, when he was personally present in Gdansk, forbade the word, there was another time, another reason, namely the civil discord in the city. Now that they are unanimous and have allowed that which is greater, namely the word, why not also that which is lesser? For in adversity man can do without the sacrament, but not without the word. But if there is another reason, which | do not know, which would be more decisive, so that they could not allow it, then you may not depart from the service of the word, nor leave the church, but teach constantly the word of the sacrament. And if necessity compels that in the main service 1) the use be not permitted, yet may they desire it with sighing and longing, and in the meantime so comfort themselves of the Sacrament in faith, until God hears the sighing of the voices and gives the spirit of strength, that they may dare to confess freely and also receive the outward sign or custom of the Sacrament. The greatest part is changed because the use of the preaching ministry is changed by the Word. 2) May the Lord strengthen you and all of you by His Holy Spirit, so that you may finally dare to do it and do it happily, amen.

Luther writes to him that he cannot serve him in the duchy of Duke Moritz of Saxony. 


From your Cod. asn. L. 24. n., fol. 181, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 549. 

Grace and peace! | am weak, my dear Riemann, and tired of life, and | think of saying goodbye to the world, which is completely in trouble. May the Lord grant you a good hour and a blessed departure, amen. In the duchy of Moritz | can serve you in nothing, and the courts are so busy, or rather they make so much trouble for themselves, that they can neither take care of themselves nor of others, and with such a great shaking of things and the threatening rod of wrath they snore, or rather, they freeze in despair, so that we would do best if we asked the Lord to hasten the day of our redemption. In this world, everything that was expected to be good from the future has been and gone. Nothing remains but a flood of evils, which has begun and proves its power. Fare well in the Lord and pray for me. Wednesday after Judica [March 14] 1543

G. u. F. and my poor Pater noster. Most noble, highborn Prince, most gracious Lord! My dear brother-in-law, the House of Bora, has been able to send this letter to E. C. F. G., showing me how E. C. F. G. intends to change the monasteries and sequestration, which | have often heard (but not understood) and desired from many good people. God grant that it may also become better, amen. Now Haus von Bora asks E. C. F. G. to graciously let him see that he does not have to be in harm's way, but because he has begun to damage the monastery with his darthun, that he may receive it. There is no doubt about E. C. F. G.'s heart and courage. But C.F.G. sees and experiences how the people are now, and how difficult the regime has become, so that it would be necessary for a gentleman to have eyes and ears in all corners. There is no more conscience nor faithfulness. God help you regents. You are poor, afflicted people, to whom few people are kind, all devils are grudging, even friends are not firm friends. May God and His people be and remain gracious and kind to you. You may well, especially in this last furious malice of all devils and men. E. C. F. G. will know how to graciously show that the good journeyman is not in harm's way. Hiemit dem lieben GOtte befohlen, Amen, Die Gertrudis [March 17] 1543.

Because of the unfortunate outcome of the campaign, he had to endure a lot of misfortune, although with no reason.

In what way could this be done more conveniently and clearly than by such presentations? which, however, must be serious and moderate, not actor-like, as they used to be in the papacy.

Nicolaus Gallus 3) from Kéthen stayed at the school of our church for ten years, and because of his erudition and his very good manners he was decorated with the degree of a master in philosophy. After that, however, he gave samples of his erudition, faith and diligence both in the schools and in the churches. Therefore we were pleased that he was appointed to the office of a deacon in the church at Regensburg. Although his studies were known to us beforehand and approved by us, when he sought ordination, we nevertheless heard him again publicly and recognized that he understood and held the teachings of Christ correctly and accepted the pure opinion of the Gospel, which our church confesses in one spirit and with one voice with the general church of Christ, and that he had an abhorrence of the fanatical opinions that are condemned by the judgment of the general church of Christ. This Magister Nicolaus also promised constancy in doctrine and faithfulness and diligence in office. Therefore, according to the teaching of the apostles, he is commanded by public ordination to teach the gospel and to administer the sacraments instituted by Christ according to his profession. And since it is written of the Son of God [Eph. 4, 8.11.]: "He ascended on high and gave gifts to men, prophets, apostles, shepherds and teachers", we ask with fervent wishes that he may give suitable and salutary regents to his church, and grant that the office of this Nicolaus may be effective and salvific. 

We read that Lucius of Cyrene, a disciple of the Apostles, taught the Gospel at the beginning on the Danube in Augusta Tiberina, from whose remains Regensburg was built. Now we rejoice that the old church is being restored and cleansed, and we exhort the godly citizens of Regensburg to see to it that the Gospel of God is preserved and propagated purely and faithfully. For God demands that He be honored primarily through this service.

1) We cannot help but notice here that, as in several places the same expression, so also this sentence is found from word to word in the Facultatszeugniss No. 2995, without the slightest deviation. Nevertheless, Bretschneider i. |., and Seidemann follows him, claims that this testimony was written by Melanchthon, and even brings forward as a reason for proof that this writing is not found in De Wette. - We consider this to be a testimony of Luther. 

2) According to Luther's Chronikon, St. Louis Edition, Vol. XI V, 561, the result is 3847 years. 

3) Instead of impiorum, shouldn't imperiorum [the empires] perhaps be read? 

4) Melanchthon co-signed because he had left that day to visit the Archbishop of Cologne. 

5) This letter of Luther is missing. Luther's answer to the present letter is also missing. 





We have read the contents of the complaint you have made to us on behalf of the chapter and the city of Naumburg, and also on behalf of Doctor Curio, and have noted the notification you have made to us on behalf of the chapter and the city of Naumburg, which you have not done otherwise than in your faithful opinion. And because the Naumburg complaints have been brought before us, we do not want to refrain from duly seeing to it that, with God's help, things are straightened out so that there will be no cause for some annoyance or cheap gossip on our part. We have also heard that Doctor Medeler, the prefect of Naumburg, has been with you and has let himself be heard that he no longer wishes to remain in this place. Since it should now be good that he be taken away from the place, the people of Brunswick would like him very much, as we still receive a letter from them today, in which they ask for him again. We note, however, that those of Naumburg did not want to leave him gladly; so we also have care, should he leave the place, and another be appointed in his place, there might be other more injustices to Naumburg and also in the monastery, because the complaint, so Doctor Medeler has, can be easily settled by means of divine help. Where now the said Doctor Medeler is to be retained in Naumburg, we graciously request that you consider appointing another skilful and honest man as superintendent in Brunswick, and that you name him to us by your letter. For we want to put off the people of Brunswick in our answer, if D. Medeler of Naumburg is not to be taken, that then another skilful, honest man should be sent to them. 

But as far as Doctor Curio is concerned, we would have thought that he would have gone into service elsewhere for the 6) reason we gave you in our answer. For he hopes that nothing will be brought upon him, for as far as the beating is concerned, you know that witnesses are not called to such matters of which he has been accused, for which reason the law has decreed other ways of inquisition in this matter. 7) The beating of Doctor Curio, however, would have been a punishable offense. Nevertheless, the beating would also be reason enough for us to let him go. But because we note that you like to see him in Wittenberg and want him around you, since you should live longer, for the preservation of your health, we also want to tolerate him there longer, and let him stay with the lectionary.

But you want to indicate to him that he should behave in this way, so that such a thing does not come to us from him; for if it were to happen, we would not refrain from punishing one with the other in due inquisition.

To Duke Albrecht of Prussia. 


Luther writes what he said on behalf of the duke about the future employment of M. Christoph Jonas at the high school in K6nigsberg, and what he answered. About Melanchthon's journey to Cologne and about the Imperial Diet in Nuremberg. 


From Faber's collection of letters, p. 49, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 357 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 60. 

S. and F. Serene, highborn prince, gracious lord! | have spoken with M. Christophoro, as E. F. G. wrote to me; he gives me this answer: M. Philipps has advised him to move to the French countryside. Now M. Philipps is not native now, but with the bishop at Kdllen to plant the Evangelion. For the two bishops of Kdéllen and Munster have (praise God) seriously accepted the Gospel, no matter how hard the Thumherreu oppose it. This is also the case in your duchy of Brunswick. There will not be much evil and little piety here, as they say: The nearer Rome, the worse Christians, and Jerusalem, the holy city, must always do the most evil, as the prophets say. However, M. Christophorus has offered to serve his fatherland with all his will after his return; he believes that the school is well enough staffed with other masters at this time.

To Justus Menius, pastor in Eisenach. 


Georg von Harstall from Creuzburg (see No. 2990) had been with Luther and had offered to sign a contract with the pastor Georg Spenlein if he would stop attacking people. Now Luther asks Menius to investigate how this accusation against the pastor stands. About the request of another preacher for an allowance.

To the highly placed man, Mr. Justus Menius, the extremely vigilant pastor of the church in Eisenach. 

The captain of Creuzburg, Georg von Harstall, has been here, my dear Justus, and has talked to me and complained heavily that he is 2) troubled in his conscience by my letter, but he puts the blame on the pastor Georg. 3) He is ready to suffer and do anything, if only the pastor would keep his tongue from 4) attacking people; 


1) On Easter Day 1543, in a monastery near Metz, which belonged to Count Wilhelm von Firstenberg, about two hundred citizens gathered with their wives to partake of the sacrament under both forms. When Gus (gubennator Scampaniae) heard of this, he attacked them with a band of horsemen, had the women stripped and defiled in view of their husbands. (Seidemann in De Wette, vol. VI, p. 571, note 4.)

Because this question about persons and vices is ambiguous, | did not want to promise him anything else than that | would write to you, to whom these churches were commanded. Therefore, | ask you to investigate according to your office whether the whole people of Creuzburg is upset against the priest, or whether the priest is excessive in attacking the people, and to defeat or end the matter according to your wisdom. I, who am absent, cannot judge anything about it. 

Your deacon, Johann Albinus, writes so often to me that | should obtain an increased salary for him, but you know that | have to write so many letters for this reason, so that | am forced to advise many that they should not supplicate, so that they do not find obstacles. For if they have started to repeatedly throw our letters at the court, then it is over in the future, since | have also often suffered a negative response. Then | do not know how things stand in your! Thuringia, or from where one can ask for an allowance; but if the place is not named, they will reject the request all the more easily. Therefore, either you write for him as visitator, or appoint him to a fatter place. | see that the birds of prey at court are multiplying, since the very good prince does not understand everything that Satan has in mind, just as no one understands it well enough. This | write, who would have become a corpse long ago, if God had heard my pleas. | am nothing and of no use anymore. Be well and be strong in the Lord. On the 8th day of May, 1543 ,

My dear Doctor! | cannot tell you in a gracious and good opinion that we have a servant, called Johann Ullen, who has been the servant of my cousin, Count Hoyern, of blessed memory, for a long time, who has faithfully served my cousins and my brothers up to this time.

So my request to you is that you, as the true servant of God, when he comes to you, 2) report him with patience, as you, praise God, know how to keep yourselves well. For he is an old man, as you will see, and for my sake, when he would (word) to you, | want to prove to him promotion and will, and take the reward from God.

Melanchthon to Luther. 


Report on his stay with the Bishop of Cologne in Bonn and on the religious affairs there. About the religious conditions in that region.

To the highly famous and valuable man, Mr. Martin Luther, Doctor of Theology, the restorer of the godly doctrine of the Gospel, his extremely dear father, 


Hail! After | came to Bonn, | understood that the bishop had given the order that a form of doctrine and customs should be drawn up in writing, which should be presented to the churches, according to the model of the Nuremberg form. And | have been commanded to carry out the work | have begun. This | have done for the last three days. The bishop wants the doctrine to be presented purely and the public customs that conflict with the doctrine to be abolished, but the canons do not refrain from opposing it, even though there are some among them who prevent the violence of the others. Some of the more stormy ones had threatened that they would chase the bishop away. Therefore, the landgrave wrote to the cathedral chapter and publicly declared that he and the other allies would take over the defense of the bishop if necessary. But the other cities, except Cologne, and the main part of the nobility demand a godly establishment of the churches, which, as you see, is truly necessary. For hardly anywhere else in Germany, | believe, has there been or still exists so much barbaric and completely pagan superstition as has existed in these regions, as is still shown by the examples of those who run to the statues. But | see that now the sermons of Bucer and Pistor are heard by a large crowd, and | perceive that both teach purely and rightly. There are also others in some neighboring towns and villages who teach rightly and administer the sacraments godly. Let us pray that God will favor and promote these beginnings. In the Julich region, the churches are completely neglected, which tends to happen at the time of war. In the meantime, those who hate the pure doctrine in that region are also exercising their rage on this occasion, as can be seen from the letter | have enclosed, which someone from the Julich region has written. | pray to God, the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may preserve you unharmed and give you a long life for the benefit of His Church. | greet the honored woman, your wife, and the

She is now in misery and asks that we have mercy on her. But since | have decided, for many very important reasons, to have nothing more to do with the court of your Duke," | can be of no help to her by writing letters to Prince Moritz. Therefore, it seemed good to me to inform you of this, since you are in special esteem with this prince, whether you would deign to use yourself for her, that the prince would like to provide her with a vain alms, for the sake of the service to the word, which her husband has sown and spread in his territory and in the church at Débeln in the most faithful and loudest way:

People love God with all their strength and die of love.

Yet | rejoice greatly and wish you happiness with all my heart, but | praise God, the Father of all grace and blessing, that He, whether through the writings of ours or others, has made known to you His salvation and this unspeakable mystery of Jesus Christ His Son.

For what do you lack in spiritual goods through Christ, who know and confess Christ, the Son of God, who hunger and thirst so ardently for righteousness, who suffer so blessedly persecutions for the sake of Christ, who hate the enemies of Christ and the Antichrist so completely? Who of us could have hoped that such a thing could either happen in our lives in Italy itself, or that it would one day happen within the own borders of the kingdom of Antichrist, who would not suffer us who are outside the borders of the world?

Whatever the nature of your child may be, receive it graciously, not according to its merit or worthiness, but according to your sincere kindness. 

First of all, that you ask that the princes of our community write for you to your senate, we have certainly done this diligently and with good will until now. But because the distance of the places causes a delay, and the endless burden of business by which the princes are occupied both abroad and at home, we have not yet done so much as we would like. May God grant that it will happen soon. There is no doubt about the willingness and good will, if only it could be done faster because of the errand by the courts. 

| can easily believe you about the wise men and the false prophets (prophetastris), who run without being sent. These pestilences of Satan have also caused us much more trouble than even the Antichrist; even now not all of them are at rest, although their powers are not a little broken by Christ. But only we are not better than our fathers. [1 Cor. 11:19:] "There must be brethren among you, that they which are righteous may be made manifest," and (so says Peter [2 Ep. 2:1]) "as there were false prophets among that people, so shall there be false teachers among you." There must be a Judas Iscarioth standing out, let alone mingling with. 

With one part, or with a certain part of one party of the Sacramentarians, a treaty has been reached; Christ grant that it may be a firm and lasting one. Among these are those at Basel, Strasbourg and Ulm, where admittedly the old leaven has not yet been completely swept out of the large group, but the clergy and the doctrine seem to be unharmed and healthy. For Bucer gives a companion to Philip in the church at Cologne, which would not be tolerated, nor would Philip suffer if he were thought to be dishonest. But in Switzerland especially the Zurichers and _ their neighbors remain enemies of the sacrament and use common bread and common wine, to the exclusion of the body and blood of Christ. There are, of course, men who have taught 


2876 


are in all languages, but they have a different spirit than us; they are drunken people with whom one must avoid contact. For our opinion (as you write) is not unknown to you. We hold that in the sacrament not only bread and wine are offered, but truly the body and blood of Christ, not only to the worthy and faithful, but also to the unworthy and ungodly, as Paul teaches and the whole church has held until now and has kept until now. About transubstantiation we reject the useless and sophistical disputation, and do not care whether someone else wants to believe it or not. But with those who are now reconciled, there was discord before, because they deceived us with cunning and crafty words: that in the sacrament the body and blood of Christ are presented with the bread and wine, 1) but with the understanding that the mouth receives the bread and wine, but the body and blood are not received by the mouth, but by the faith or spirit of the believer in the heart, and this they interpreted in such a way that between us and them there seemed to have been only a dispute over words or a kind of quibbling, so that a union might be established all the more easily. But we have so escaped this transubstantiation and deception that we have to admit that even the mouth of an ungodly man receives the body and the blood when he receives the bread and the wine. For what need is there of that spiritual partaking of the body and blood of a sacrament, since it is also partaken of in this manner in baptism, yea, in any word offered, even without mention of the body and blood. Christ speaks of this in John 6:53: "If you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you," that is, if you do not believe that | became man for you, suffered, and shed my blood. Therefore, you also must watch lest a false prophet creep in with this deception and secretly introduce himself to you. 

But from a defense of the reconciliation, which was brought out by Magister Philippus

2) | Know absolutely nothing about it, nor have | seen it; | will carefully inquire about it from outsiders (exteros). You have my opinion, which | as a German have testified in more than one book, (as it seems to me) openly and clearly. 

By the way, our churches are also calm: pure doctrine, right use of the sacraments, everywhere learned and faithful shepherds, thanks be to God; but in the fruit of the word and the works there is not the same fruitfulness and heat. The people are cold, and many abuse the freedom of the Spirit to the lukewarmness and security of the flesh, and we cannot eradicate this abuse from within our borders. Christ multiply his spirit among you. The Lord JEsus Christ better and complete all things, and hasten the day of our redemption. The world, the Turk, the Jews, the Pope rage by blaspheming the name of the Lord, by desolating His kingdom, by ridiculing His will, since in the meantime they enjoy the daily bread almost alone 3) and the members of Christ are killed. But he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world; he triumphs and will triumph in you to the end. He comforts you with his Holy Spirit, in whom he has called you to the fellowship of his body. We will not cease to give thanks for you, and we do not doubt that this will be done by you again. 

What is written at the end about the dishonesty of the booksellers, we hear with sadness, and if | could also do something in this matter, | would gladly do it. If you would now deal with M. Veit Dietrich about this, he could send through the Nurembergers all the books that you always wanted, if you would let a list or register reach him. | hope that you have the /oci communes of Philip, likewise the letter to the Romans, the Daniel 2c.

Grace and peace in the Lord, who favors and blesses your marriage, amen. We fight here for you against [evil] 1) tongues stronger than perhaps you yourself. There is no measure nor end to judging. But Christ says, "Judge not, lest ye be judged" [Matt. 7:1], and rightly are they judged. For while they condemn the mote in another's eye, they will carry about in their own eye the damned beam, become a mockery to devils, a laughter to angels. So we say confidently 2) against them: "If 10 whores were here, who corrupted many students with Frenchmen", there no one judges and is angry; all are [dumb as the] fish or quite indolent judges and almost protectors; if half the city of adultery, usury, theft, lyin

They rage extraordinarily according to their desires, and it is the time which is foretold after the fall of the Antichrist, namely that men will be epicureans and atheists, so that the word of Christ will be fulfilled [Luc. 17, 26. 28.]: "As it happened in the days of Noah and Lot, so it will also happen in the days of the future of the Son of Man.” You are at ease in the Lord with your own. | respectfully greet your comrades in office.

Give the matter that hovers between you and the schoolmaster, and show love toward him, as Paul says [2 Cor. 2:8]. Let also some of thy right depart, if dll think thou hast it, lest Satan tempt us, who, as we know, hath such thoughts as to deceive us, and from a spark to blow up a conflagration. It is hard for him to change his position so suddenly, which dll also easily understand. But you can do this comfortably and with a safe conscience if you tell him that you were moved by my name and by my requests to accept him again without further negotiation. In this you will follow the example of the heavenly Father who, for the sake of the petitions of his Son, our mediator, and in his name, not only accepts us for mercy, but also hears all our prayers and does all good without rebuke or trial, forgetting all sins that otherwise cannot be atoned for by any merit of our humility or by satisfaction. 

This one debt or thing, whatever it may be, | ask you to forget. Then, if he should add something, then what the spirit teaches must be done. You have praised him before and know that he has been diligent. Who is there who is not sometimes absent, or if he is not absent, who would not be challenged, even innocently, by the devil? | have confidence and expect with certainty from your godliness that you will not despise these petitions of mine, because he has given himself entirely into my power.

Grace and peace in the Lord! Even today, my dear venerable bishop, | do not stop thinking about the time when | could finally come to you. During the winter it did not work. After Pentecost | had decided in the most certain way, for | had prepared everything, but my health was so shaky that | did not dare to undertake the journey, and even today, yes, even yesterday, | almost fainted, so that | must daily suspect the hour of my death. And oh, that God would want to snatch me away from this satanic realm of the world as soon as possible at some good hour. 1) That this bishopric is burdensome for you, | believe very much, even without your testimony, but it is and has been the will of God, of which we say: "Thy will be done"; in yours we must live, be happy and bear everything that happens. If it pleases no one, it is enough that what we do or what we suffer is most pleasing to His will. He will repay us in his time for submitting to his good will, even though it is unknowable and imperceptible. It is a misery in which you live, but it is connected with eternal glory and the pleasure of God, because you do not serve yourself but His will in this bondage. Then it is a hindrance to the devil and his own, so that they can no longer do evil. And far be it from thee to be a bishop like unto those bellies, which here have their consolation unto everlasting shame and punishment. For they are not with us in suffering; they are not scourged with men. Therefore take comfort and be strong in the Lord, knowing that you are with the saints in blessedness. "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted in the LORD." Pray for me that | may either die soon in the Lord, or that when | am restored | may visit you soon, Amen. On Saturday after Margaret [July 14] in the year 1543. Yours M. Luther, D.

About the repurchase. 


A copy is available in the library at Wittenberg, published by H. Lindner in the Theologische Studien und Kritiken, 1835, Heft ll, p. 357. From it in the Erlanger Ausgabe, Vol. 56, p. LVII and in Seidemann-De Wette, Vol. VI, p. 346. 


To the honorable, prudent Bastian Miller, citizen of Mansfeld, my good friend and dear brother- in-law. 

G. and F. in the Lord. Honorable, prudent, dear brother-in-law! If you have read Brentium Luca 6, then you have found good certain reason, which rhymes well with the disputation of D. Hieronymi Schurff, and my booklet on usury 2) is also not against it, although in the same booklet | write nothing of the contract reemptionis, but of the mutuo and dato (which now all has also become usury or would like to be). Fifteen years ago | wrote about usury. 3) Then | dealt with the contract reemptionis. That you indicate that it is strange to you that another should improve his property with your money, and you have nothing from it, is probably another unnecessary good work, as | might give 100 fl. to someone who should not. But this does not excuse usury; why did | not keep it, or use it more needfully? 

Belongs to the repurchase: 

Primo hypotheca, a pledge, as a field’. 

House, city, land on which the interest is purchased. For that which bears nothing can bear no interest. And where the pledge spoils or is lost in war by enemies, as Turks, then both lose theirs, the buyer and seller. 

Therefore, on merely bad money, as on a hundred (or how much that is) guilders, without sub

2) "An die Pfarrherren, wider den Wucher zu Predigen," St. Louis edition, vol. X, 860. 

3) "Von Kaufhandlung und Wucher." St. Louis edition, Vol. X, 914. 


Pledge expressed and called, five or more, even one fl.. Taking one heller is usury. 

Secundo, that the buyer (who buys the interest) remains obliged to allow the seller (who takes the sum of money on his credit) in turn the redemption of the interest with the same sum, if he can or wants. 

Therefore, if the buyer reserves to him the. Summa of his money, so that he buys the interest, to demand again over One, two, three 2c. Therefore, if the buyer reserves the right to reclaim the sum of his money for the purchase of the goods over one, two, three 2c. years, which the lawyers call repetitio sortis, this is also usury, a real villain, because it wants to be borrowed money at the same time (which may be reclaimed) and yet also a purchase money (which | may not reclaim according to the received goods). 

Although one wants to dispute here, if the seller desires or grants the recovery from himself, as he no longer wants to have sold it, which is strange, and may well take care that [it] is not a sham without light. But this is not to be written now. Hereby commanded by God. Thursday after Magdalene [July 26] 1543.

To Hermann Bonn. 


Bonn, a native of Quackenbriick in Westphalia, was first Rector in Libeck, and when Bugenhagen introduced the Reformation there in 1530, he was elected Superintendent. When in 1543 the bishop of Munster and Osnabriick wanted to reform his lands, he was called by him to Osnabriick to carry out this work. Now Luther asked him to follow this call, since the Libeckers could manage without him for a while.

Since you write, and | believe this very easily even without your letter, that the Bishop of Minster cannot do without your help in the new planting of the church, then | advise and persuade you that you will in no case leave the bishop.

who is called to the gospel by such a great gift of God. For you would not only cause trouble for all of us, but also for the spirit of Christ within us. We see God's miraculous deeds, who calls such great princes and bishops, which until now one could almost not even hope for, through His holy call, and draws them in sincere heart movement through the Spirit. How incompatible it would be with our confession and our salvation if we either neglected or hindered such a work of God! We would do so in any case if we wanted to withdraw from or abandon those to whom we should rather run and serve them with all our zeal. | hope that your LUbeckers, as sensible and conscientious men, will easily grant you so much time, even though their exceedingly godly care and zeal for you has pleased me very much. For | know no greater joy in this life than when | hear that the congregations love their shepherds, bear desire for them, and are zealous for them. But they will consider that after they have a well-ordered church, and very good men who can do your service in your place for a little while, they will gladly render this obedience to the Lord, so that through you and their patience other people may also obtain salvation, that the Father of our Lord JEsu Christ may be glorified even more. | have this hope for them, since | see that they are so disposed toward you that they do not want to do without you.

Perhaps we shall now learn that in the days of Noah it was thus said [Mos. 6:13], "The earth is full of iniquity,” that is, full of righteousness and truth. No one is unjust, no one lies, no one sins; only those who suffer injustice are unjust, liars, sinners. "It will rain filth!" The day of redemption hastens its arrival, amen.

No. 3038. (Wittenberg.) August 29, 1543. 


To Eberhard Brisger, preacher in Altenburg. 


Luther exhorts him to be patient with a debtor and with Spalatin. 


Handwritten in Cod. Goth. 185. 4. and in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, p. 412. Printed in Schutze, vol. |, p. 274 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 586. 


Grace and peace! | believe completely, my dear Eberhard, that you need your money and your things. Again, | see that Bruno, 3) | don't know under the influence of which stars, has little luck in getting rich, and he also needs support everywhere, and besides, the Ballers act and live in such a way that they do not allow their country priests even a morsel of bread. Therefore | ask you, since you can spare your debt demands for a little while longer with less difficulty, to be patient with Bruno. We are anxious (if at all possible) to provide him with a fatter parish as soon as possible. | would not burden you with this request, because | would not think that you could be at my will quite well and without harm. With Spalatin, | beg you, have patience as much as you can; you know that he is otherwise a good and faithful man. Since Satan was once among the children of God, yes, among the angels in heaven, what is it to wonder that he strives to be among us, to sift and shake us? Then the old age contributes something to it, and above all the long habit of peace, which he enjoyed under three princes. Therefore one does not have to 


2) Instead of proficere, read prospicere, according to the Vulgate. 

3) Bruno Braun, pastor at Dobin near Wittenberg. He will have bought Brisger's house around the beginning of 1535 (see No. 2098), which he sold again to Luther in 1541. 


2894 


The old trees can be broken, but not bent, and the neck of the old dogs does not want to put up with the lead strap. Therefore, patience is necessary so that we can have peace. But | write this only to remind you. You will easily see for yourself what is necessary for you to do and what is useful for everyone. Be at ease in the Lord.

Venice. August 30, 1543. 


The brothers in the Venetian to Luther. 


(Regest.) 

Answer to Luther's letter No. 3021. The letters of the princes to the council of Venice had been read out in the assembly of the same by Matthias Flacius; out of consideration for the papists, however, the authenticity of the letters had been suspected 2c., which is why the princes would like to write again, which Luther should cause them to do. They profess Luther's doctrine of the Lord's Supper and express the fear that after his death false prophets will arise in this direction 2c.

Luther refers him to a book published in Kronstadt because of the reformation of his church. 


1) Instead of Augusti, it will probably read Augustini, and therefore the 29th of August, not the 30th, which De Wette offers (Burkhardt). Seidemann also assumes this date.

To the man highly esteemed in the Lord, Mr. Matthias Romaschi, parish _ priest at Hermannstadt (Cibinensi == Nagy Szeben) and dean of the same chapter, his extremely dear brother. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! At the same time as your letter, my dear Matthias, your messenger brought me a booklet about the reformation of the church in Kronstadt and the whole Burzenland, 2) which was printed in Kronstadt. | wanted to send it to you, but the messenger said that there were many copies with you and wanted me to keep it. For everything you desire from me you will find better in this book than | can write it. | liked it very much, because it is written so learnedly, purely and faithfully. Therefore, read this booklet and get in touch with the preachers of the church in Kronstadt; they will be very useful to you in the reformation of your church. For they have carefully followed the form of our church in this booklet, to the same and to them | will have referred you. Herewith be at ease in the Lord, and may you succeed, amen.

Luther and Melanchthon to the council at Halle [?] 


Luther counsels patience in the abolition of common women's shelters. 


From Cod. chart. 398. f. Goth. in Seidemann-DeWette, vol. VI, p.417, without any time determination, and (likewise) in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. LXIX. From a copy in the archive at Zerbst, with the above date, in Kolde, Analecta, p. 391. We give the text according to Kolde, in which alone Melanchthon's concern, written in Latin, is found. 


Opinion D. Mart. Luth. about the abdication of the common women's house in Halle. 


So it seems to me that until the gospel is more firmly rooted and the weeds are rooted out, we must be patient with this matter for a little while longer, so that we do not do too much harm to the good by rooting out the evil in an untimely manner; for there is still (I say) great heathenism among the Christians. But as soon as one can do this, it must be done in earnest. However, the preachers should preach fiercely against it, so that your honorable council will be prepared the way and cause to control such paganism 2) more effectively. Given in 1543, September 13. 


Opinion of Mr. Phil. Melanthon on the same matter. 


| do not defend fornication and do not write this opinion of mine as a doctrine. And | wish that in the cities there was such discipline and restraint of the people, that the fornicators would not have been allowed places. But because we live among pagans, | have admonished the teachers of the gospel to teach their congregations duly that fornication is to be fled. That is enough for a preacher. Another office is to decide on the expulsion of notorious persons. There the authorities may see to it that they counsel both the heathen and others.

[To Do]ctor Martinus [Luther zJu 3) own hand. 


Dear Doctor (togktor)! | have read your letter and from your report | find that it is not a river (fluss) nor will it be, but only a woe (wettagen) of evil blood (gebleutt). If it is on the right side, it comes from the liver; if it is on the left side, it comes from the spleen. It is necessary to know this, otherwise | cannot give my advice. But when | am informed of this through your writing, then | will, through the help of Almighty God, continue to give you my advice, and | hope to God that it will ease your pain and be for your good. So | hear that you are burdened with the stone. Write to me how long it has afflicted you and what time (wilczeit) in the year, and how often, [so] | hope to God that | will also give you help by God's grace. You are commanded to do so and remember me in your devotion to God. Given on Friday, the 14th day of the autumn month of Anno 43 Jare. Dorothea, Countess of Mansfeld, 4) Witt[ib].

Request for improvement of his material situation.

Worthy, Respectable and Esteemed, Favorable Dear Sir! Ew. A. W. I, a poor priest, lament that | have now spent fifteen years in the parish of Moegel in the Silesian ministry, burdened with nine small, uneducated children, one of whom has been afflicted with seven years of constant illness to this day, It is daily afflicted with ulcers of the limbs and aches of the head, but nevertheless must have its food and drink, and the income of the parish is very low, because | have annually not [more than] 8 malt of grain, 5 malt of oats, 2 old shocks of offering money, 16 Gr. annual interest, from which | have to live the whole year.

Also, worthy, highly esteemed, respectable and favorable lord, there are two farmers (paur) who are servants of this parish. Now | can enjoy them very little, because if they are to serve me at times in small things, which happens rarely, and since | give them food and drink all the time, out of no duty, but out of good will, there is nothing but vain displeasure, rumbling, cursing and scolding with mocking slanderous words against my wife and child, by which another is often moved to anger, and an annoyance may arise from it. And because they are of little service to me and also to my offspring, | consider that it would be of little disadvantage to the said parish, even if the same peasants would be smitten with services, according to S. Ch. F. G.'s gracious will, either to Schweinitz or Sidisch Amt, and that the parishes might receive a small allowance for it, which | have promised to S. Ch.

To the highly placed man, Mr. M. Anton Lauterbach, your right and faithful bishop of the church at Pirna, his exceedingly dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Be ge- 

be undaunted, my dear Anton, and wait for the Lord [Ps. 27:14], and let the wicked boast and triumph, whose glory is put to shame [Phil. 3:19]. For how often have these bulls and puffed-up bladders of water been bristling hitherto, and yet, as the 7th Psalm [v. 15.] has said, they have been pregnant with calamity, and have borne a miscarriage, and as Isaiah, Cap.33,11. has said: With straw ye shall conceive, and stubble shall ye bear. It will happen one day that the heavens will fall and be burned up with the earth, but even then we will not perish or lose God. Your Meissners are not revealed to me only now what kind of people they were. | have always seen that they were those who waited for an opportunity to reveal their hypocrisy, which was not happily hidden. Let us only be careful to be sure of the word and to teach it diligently, but cast all care upon God. He cares for us; cast your care upon the Lord. Terrible things are said about the Turk. But the emperor will not yet accomplish what the papists praise; "he takes too much in one bite. But let us teach, believe, pray, do and suffer what we must, and let the dead bury their dead. What do we care about those who are outside? Be well in the Lord and pray for me. My Lord Kathe greets you reverently with yours. Witten-

We had also promised the highly famous Mr. Bernhard Ziegler, who asked for it in the common name of all [to be graduated], that we would come to the public proclamation of his and his comrades' [doctoral] degrees, and after we received your letter, which is written very urgently and honorably, we were even more moved to wish that we could comply with you. For although in these sad times some ill-wishers will judge these meetings of ours differently, the reason mentioned in your letter is a very honest one, namely that it is useful to give expression not only to our agreement but also to our true goodwill towards each other. But by chance we are held back here against our will, because Erasmus Alberus will bring his friends here on the same day, which is intended for your celebration, in order to attend the proclamation of his [Doctor's] degree, and another day could not now suddenly be indicated to them.

But you will accept the necessity as an excuse. 

We hope, however, that our unity and mutual love has often been demonstrated by other, greater ministries, and with the help of God we will strive with all diligence to preserve and demonstrate it in the future as well. For in and of itself it is a necessary thing that those who have the right doctrine be united, especially those who lead the churches and the studies of doctrine, and in these areas it is exceedingly useful for a peaceful life. However, the prestige of our ministry (ministerif) could not be preserved if, out of spite, we ourselves began to quarrel and bicker among ourselves, which God would prevent. Therefore, your whole argument about the harmony of our state (ordinis) was very pleasant to us, and we ask the eternal God, the Father of our Lord JEsu Christ, with all our heart that He may always protect the union of those who have right doctrine in these churches. It is praised what Dion, since he wrote to his kinsman! Dionysius writes, or perhaps the author of that letter, Plato, cites: No shining 2) gold, no demant shines so in the eyes, as the perception of good unanimous men. This is certainly true and very sweetly said. True is also the word of Basil: The left does not need the right as much as the church needs the unity of the teachers. 

But you know many similar divine sayings; God wanted that everywhere all those who express zeal for the right doctrine would be moved by them; and yet they often arouse, by the most heinous storms, as in a ship, harmful upheavals, confuse the doctrines, separate the churches. From this arises among the people either superstition, or contempt of God and hatred of all religion, destruction of discipline, parties, discord among princes, murder of citizens and endless desolation. What can be thought sadder than these evils? Therefore, let us also ask God to bind the hearts of all teachers with the eternal bonds of right opinion and His Spirit, and let us ourselves

Injured by Luther's writings, especially by the one that had just gone out "from the last words of David", in which he is called a heretic, he seeks to justify his Christology by referring to the false doctrine of the Swiss, and asks Luther to read his last writings sent to him enclosed together with the Confession sent to Melanchthon a year ago and to examine his teaching, and not to condemn him any longer without reason 2c.

Although he, as he is naturally gifted for all arts, has happily learned a large part of philosophy, he has nevertheless, because he truly and wholeheartedly believes that the human race did not come into being by chance, but was created by God, and that God has revealed Himself through certain testimonies in this One kind of teaching, which has been handed down to the Church through the prophets, Christ and the apostles from the beginning until now through a known succession, he has directed his studies primarily to learning about the heavenly teaching. In order to be able to hear the words of the prophets and apostles, he learned the Hebrew and Greek languages, and also studied the history of all times, which is contained in Hebrew, Greek and Latin writings, the knowledge of which contributes a great deal to informing the minds and strengthening the right opinions. He has diligently listened to the exegetes of the prophets and the apostles at this school, and compared the ancient Greek and Latin writers on the teachings of the church and the decrees of the godly conciliarities, so that he could record what the church of the apostles had held in the purer times, and he could call upon God with firm faith and teach others rightly. Since he was appointed by the honorable council of Regensburg to teach the Gospel, and since we requested that he be recommended by the testimony commonly used in the schools, we have gladly decorated this Hieronymus Nopus with the degree of Doctor of Theology because of his very good conduct and his_ excellent scholarship, and testify to this by this letter, and ask the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, because he has drawn him into the light of the Gospel and given him the will that he may desire 


2908 


to serve the church in a godly manner, that He may assist him, that his service may be happy and beneficial, as it is written [Phil. 2:13]: "It is God who causes us to desire good and helps us to accomplish it according to His good pleasure, that is, so that something pleasing to Him may happen. For the greatest part of the human race, which senselessly despises God, proceeds in deeds of shame, by which God is terribly angered. But lest the whole human race perish, God snatches out some and places them in His Church, through which good and salvific things are done, through which the light of the Gospel is spread far and wide and many are called to the knowledge of God and to eternal life, for whose sake the world regiments are preserved, which provide hostels for the Church. We hope that Jerome Nopus will be in the number of these, and we pray from the bottom of our hearts that God will always assist him, always govern him with the Holy Spirit. Finally, we also exhort the church at Regensburg to strive to maintain the purity of the Gospel, and to nurture the church servants who teach rightly, so that they may show their gratitude to God for the renewed light of the Gospel. For it is said that in these regions, immediately after the apostles, the seed of the Gospel was scattered by Lucius of Cyrene, who is mentioned in Acts Cap. 13, 1. He is said to have followed the Roman armies to the Danube and preached the name and doctrine of Christ in Augusta Tiberina 1). So soon God gathered a church among these peoples. But now, too, the godly may rejoice that the light of the Gospel is once again kindled, and they should take care to keep it by right service, so that the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, may be rightly called and praised. Given at Wittenberg, the 15th of October, Anno 1543. M. L.

The Dean of the College of the Theological Faculty 

at the Academy in Wittenberg, Martin Luther, sends his greetings to all who will read this letter. 


We give thanks to the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He has chosen, founded and preserves a church in the Son, and continues to raise up some skillful teachers, as Paul teaches: "He ascended on high and gave gifts to men, some as prophets, some as apostles, some as shepherds, some as teachers. Therefore, it is not doubtful that wholesome teachers are God's gifts. Nevertheless, God wants an office of teaching; He has handed down to His Church the writings of the prophets and apostles, wants them to be read and known, and indicates His will in them; through this reading He instructs the minds, calls them and draws them to Himself. Therefore it is commanded concerning the study of the divine Scriptures [Col. 3:16], "Let the word of Christ dwell among you richly, teaching and admonishing yourselves." Therefore, God also calls and chooses from among the crowd of learners skillful and wholesome teachers. For this purpose, theological schools were established by the prophets and apostles according to divine counsel, and were subsequently maintained and continually restored by God. As we must now faithfully guide the studies, so it behooves us to give testimonies in view of the church to those who are called to offices, and the proclamation of our testimony is done by recognizing the [doctoral] degree according to the customary manner of the school. However, since Mr. Friedrich Bachofer 2) from Leipzig has been working for a long time on the

When he lived in the school of our church, we knew that he was of a good nature and of honorable and godly manners. Having worked diligently in philosophy and in the study of the languages, Latin and Greek and Hebrew, he diligently listened to the commentators of the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures, and compared the proven ancient writers, so that he might certainly hold the opinion of the general Church of Christ. Therefore, for the sake of his scholarship and godly conduct, he is ill called by our church to the fellowship of the evangelical preaching ministry 1) where he has given an excellent test of his scholarship and shown that he accepts in truth the unanimous teaching of the general church of Christ, which our church also follows, and he abhors all fanatical opinions that are condemned by the judgment of the general church of Christ. Since he was then appointed by the council of Hammelburg, we considered that he should be recommended by a public testimony. Therefore, since his morals were godly, and his scholarship was approved by us, which we had long recognized from his sermons and disputations, and he promised constancy in the godly doctrine which he has so far confessed to us, the dignity of Doctor of Theology was publicly conferred upon him by the pronouncement of the College, so that a testimony of our judgment about him would be available. And this we testify by this public letter, and ask the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He, since He has called him to the evangelical preaching ministry, help him so that his ministry may be happy and beneficial, as it is written [Phil. 2:13]: "It is God who works that we may will what is good, and helps that we may accomplish it according to His good pleasure, that is, that something pleasing to Him may be done. For the greatest part of the human race, which senselessly despises God, proceeds in deeds of shame, against which God is terribly angry. But so that the whole human race does not perish, God pulls out some of them.

To Daniel Cresser (Greser),” pastor at Dresden. 


Luther does not hope anything good from the form of excommunication in the works at the Dresden court. 


A copy is in Cod. Seidel. at Dresden from the blank page of Luther's letter to Lauterbach of Nov. 3, probably from the latter himself. In the margin are the words: Hanc epistolam ad me D. Lutherani scripsisse testor ego Dan. Cresserus hac mea propria manu. Printed in the Unsch. Nachr. 1715, p. 407; in Schitze, vol. |, p. 283 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 596. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1325 (as au Grosser). 

To the man to be highly honored in the Lord, Mr. 

Daniel Cresser, the extremely faithful pastor of the church in Dresden, his very dear brother. 


Mercy and peace! | cannot hope for anything good, my dear Daniel, from the form of excommunication that has been taken at your court. For if this happens, that the courts want to rule the churches according to their desires, God will not give a blessing, and the last will be worse than the first, because what happens without faith is not valid. But what is done without profession is undoubtedly done without faith and comes to naught. Either they should become pastors themselves, preach, baptize, visit the sick, serve the Lord's Supper and do all the works of a church servant (ecclessiastica), or they should stop combining the professions. They shall take care of their farms, and leave the churches to those who are attached to them.

We hereby send you two barrels, one with old wine, the other with this year's grown must, a "Suptitzer" (Suptezer), as good as the Almighty has given it to us this year; for our sake, accept it willingly and enjoy it with joy. We would have liked to send it to you better, but this time it did not grow or arrive, otherwise it should not have been in short supply. 


After the esteemed, our council and dear faithful, Magister Franciscus Burckhardt, talked with you about the articles of settlement in our Christian religion, of which you, along with Ern Magistro Philippo Melancton, united with the other scholars and theologians of our 2) Christian religion in the 1537th year at the held conference in Schmalkalden, that they would like to go out again 3) in print, both in Latin and German, as we would like such printing to be promoted before the future Imperial Diet.

G. and F. in the Lord. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! M. Forcheim 1) has indicated to me what kind of challenge the tempter now wants to inflict on E. F. G. through E. F. G.'s cousins, Prince Wolfgang 2c., which | am truly sorry about, and for this reason | have attributed quite a bit of writing to S. F. G., hoping that S. F. G. will remember it and mean something. For | notice that bad mouths have got involved between his and E. F. G.'s. F. G., who are stirring up the pious prince against E. F. G., as the devil and the old serpent always has his seed and sows against the seed of the woman. It will not be otherwise: the serpent's seed must always prick the heels of the woman's seed; but at last his head must be crushed. Therefore, let us be patient and let God take care of everything 2) according to the words: "Cast your care upon the Lord; he will take care of you," as Peter says [1 Ep. 5:7]. "If He is for us, who can be against us?" [Rom.8:31.] Perhaps this contestation is but an hour, as Abraham was contested an hour. "I live (says our life [Jn.14:19.]), and ye also shall live," and [Luc.21:18.] "One hair of your head shall not perish." And though we suffer some loss in this time, yet shall we recover it a hundredfold at the same time with eternal life, if only we follow not the eyes, but faith toward that which is invisible, until it be seen. But what do | teach the unwise to the wise (sus Minervam)? | only wanted to show in any case 3) my zeal and affection against E. F. G., who

Luther consoles Lauterbach in the temptations he has to suffer from the great ones at the ducal Saxon court, namely from D. Pistorius (Becker) and Carlewitz.

To the worthy man, Mr. M. Anton Lauterbach, pastor of the church at Pirna and bishop of the place, his brother in the 

HErrn. 

Grace and peace! | read your letter, my dear "Auto", happily, especially the part where you write that Doctor Pistorius said: "You should let us keep the Canons 2c. Of course we would like to" let these. We certainly want to let these sows keep their bran, "and the hellish fire with it. Fire to it", as they want and seek. Again, "they shall let us keep our Lord, the Son of God, and the kingdom of heaven with it. We are soon parted, like a ripe dirt and a wide asshole”. But my joy is this, that finally the thoughts of this exceedingly evil hypocrite and his kind have been revealed. Now, with a happier and safer conscience, they may be taken by us for lost slaves of Satan, who cannot be believed, even if they swear a hundred times, for see what this quite wicked "Becker" thought to bake 4), since he, communicating under both guises, and putting forward good words, ridiculed God and mocked you. Don't you remember that | was slow to believe your praises with which you adorned him to me? 5) Now you have what Doctor "Becker" is, Carlewitz and this yeast at your

The earth is the Lord's, and all that is therein, without doubt Dresden also, and all that is therein 2c. If D. "Becker" misses that heaven is his and all that is in it, then hell and its constricted narrowness will be all too close for him shortly after these days, amen, where he will dine with Duke George and become partaker of his canons and the dung of Satan, as he is worthy. May the Lord Jesus (as he began) do his work in us and continue to scatter those who are hopeful in their hearts, amen. Take heed that thou be not sad or humble before them, but that thou deal safely and cheerfully in the cause of Christ. By such cheerfulness you will crucify them and Satan with them, for he intends to overthrow and afflict us, but we want to throw him, spoken in German, into his mouth. He may want to or not, so he will be forced to suffer the one who crushes his head, however much he may bite and threaten with his terrible teeth to devour us. The seed of the woman is with us, which we teach, confess, and want to reign. In it, be well and pray for me. The third of November, 1543, yours Martin Luther, D. Postscript.

To the venerable man in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus von Amsdorf, the fair and right bishop of Naumburg, his superior in your Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | am angry with myself to the point of impatience, venerable man in the Lord, that | have so often intended to travel to you, and since | wanted to leave already the following day, and everything was set in readiness, a cause always occurred which prevented my intention. By God's permission (as it seems) Satan, according to his name, thus sets himself against me. Therefore, henceforth, God willing, | will try to rush to you on some sudden occasion even without a resolution. For | am very eager to see you again before my departure. The condition of my head was reasonably good; although the leg (crus) had been troubled by the physicians' cautery (cauterio), this would not have prevented my journey. They are trying to cause a flow on my left leg, but so far not with luck to help my head. But | believe that my illness is the old age, then also the works and the very violent thoughts, but most of all the fisticuffs of Satan. Against all this, the entire healing art will heal me in vain. Nevertheless, | give in to their opinions so that | do not seem to be hostile to myself, although | believe that they are mistaken. "It is a matter of the lazy rascal, | want to dare him; if it helps, it helps." For the head has again begun to suffer (without cause). | think it is Satan. 

lam writing this so that you may know that | have the best will, as soon as God bestows it, to come to you. 

| know nothing about news, nor do | desire to know it. The world is the world, was the world, and will be the world, which knows nothing of Christ and desires to know nothing. Let it therefore go on its way, that Christ and we also may know nothing of it; only that we know that what the world knows and desires is not true, nor will it come to pass, because it is written [Ps. 39:6, 7, Vulg.], "All men that live are vanity, and thou, O Lord, wilt make their image nothing.

make." Nevertheless, they continue to rage and get angrier day by day. This is a great comfort, it shows that the day of the coming of the glory of God is near. For the contempt of the word, which is not to be said, and the inexpressible groaning of the godly, indicate that the world is given over to hasten the day of its destruction and our blessedness, amen, be it done, amen. So was the world before the flood of sin, so before the Babylonian captivity, so before the destruction of Jerusalem, so before the desolation of Rome, so before the misery of Greece and Hungary,

Grace and peace in the Lord! M. Rérer, who exercises a very great and much dominion over me, wanted me to write this to you, my dear Veit, but, as | am rebellious against such my ruler, | would perhaps have despised his dominion if he had not used oratory and persuaded me that you must be admonished to continue in my Genesis as you have begun. But even this his oratory | could have easily nullified by oratory used against it, if the 


able to do this?" For since the mouth shall not be opened until only able, Christ shall never be preached. But it stands well, because he himself from the mouth of the young children prepares a power [Ps. 8, 3.], who through the stammering Moses, or, as he himself [2 Mos. 4, 10.] says in Hebrew, who has a heavy tongue, throws the kingdoms of the Egyptians, the Cananites 2c. to the ground, and through the unlearned apostles the whole earth. Therefore continue, so that my ruler M. Georg Rérer may be satisfied; if you sin against him, how will | be able to be merciful to you? Fare well in your Lord and pray for me.

even the Lord himself advised, my dear doctor, who says Matt. 10:14, "If they will not receive you, go out of that city, and shake off the stall from under your feet." For thou hast not rejected them, that they should not hear thee; but they reject thee, that thou shouldest not teach them. "They have not rejected thee, but me," said the Lord to Samuel [1 Sam. 8:7.], "that | should not be king over them." And Paul [Acts 13:46.], "Because ye cast away the word of salvation, behold, we turn unto the Gentiles." And thou canst not burden thy conscience with strange sins, especially those who defend them by contradicting the priest. Therefore give place to your anger, and depart, for this house is not worthy that our peace should rest upon it. And as much as it is in me, they shall have no other priest after thee, whom they shall propose to me, 1) neither shall | esteem him a good man, but rather a faithful shepherd, who shall confirm their sins and wickedness, that is, who shall dare to take thy place.

In the other and even closer degree than the sister's daughter or two sisters one after the other? Yes, Luther has let a note go out that such degrees are lappropriate. However, one may not look at other following books, since such has been corrected or, if lone wants to say it, revocirt 2). 

But it is a mere table, in which nothing is taught or commanded, but it is shown in a modest way, what lhas been handed down in the old law of these things. Because one thinks that also the mother of Mosi was tthe relative of his father Amram, 2 Mos. 6, 3) 20., although Lyra argues vehemently against it, not because it would not have been allowed at that time, Lyra does not deal with it, but because it was impossible because of the age. Because one does not have to care about the words of Tamar to her brother Amnon 4) [2 Sam. 13), they also prove nothing. So lalso M. Philippus has published something similar’) labout the degrees, and brings the examples of the fathers Isaac and Jacob and the Margrave Joachim of Brandenburg, who married the daughter of the King of Poland, although he had previously had the sibling of this very daughter, namely the daughter of George, the Duke of Saxony, that is, he married two nieces of this King of Poland, who was the father of this Sigismund. But these examples do not make a law for the peoples, also one does not have to draw a conclusion and rule from it. Nor does M. Philip say this, but it is to be remembered for the comfort of the confessors or consciences. For this purpose also my note against tthe pope was omitted, who sold the fourth, the third, tthe second degree to anxious consciences, and as he said, gave laws for money and abolished them again. For from the beginning of our doctrine we have taught quite constantly and always that the civil orders and laws must be kept. For we have taught the civil rights land the

We have fixed and approved the sword of the authorities with all their orders according to Rom. 13: "Let every man be subject to the authority that has power over him" and 1 Petr. 2, 13: "Obey the king. Then we have also done this from the beginning, that we have forbidden to bring the law of Moses back into the church, and have determined that one must use the laws of our world regime, except where a case of necessity for the consolation of consciences, not as from a law, but as an example from history, compels something to be taken. Why have they not read these writings of ours, in which we have so often stated our opinion? Therefore the laws of the fatherland and the authorities should be kept. Now if a case should arise in which it is necessary to act or counsel against the customary laws, we may now use the law of Moses as an example, and that from the public authority of the authorities, if it should be a public case, which could then comfort itself with such an example; from the desire of an individual such a thing shall not be permitted. Thus our prince, the Duke of Saxony, Elector, permits the fourth degree, the third he forbids. Duke Moritz permits the third degree, which is full on both sides in the same line, but that which is not full in the unequal line, he forbids. We stand by these orders of the authorities because it is not for the ministers of the Word to give laws; this is for the civil authorities, who have to dispose of and judge inheritances and successions that come from marriage. Therefore, marriage must also be regulated by laws. However, if any case would require dispensing, | would not be afraid to secretly advise otherwise in conscience, or, if it were a public case, to advise that he ask for a dispensation from the authorities, which would be taken from some example of the Mosaic law, especially because there would be descendants and an inheritance and the like.

Of Einsiedel's questions, the most important is the one you mention, that the name of the Father is so much reviled among the subjects. This matter should be investigated and a remedy sought.

To Justus Jonas in Halle. 


On Luther's verdict of condemnation received from Rome. About incidents of war; about the corruptibility of the commanders. Luther's fear that the same would happen in a war between the Elector and the Emperor. - When on April 24, 1547, in the battle of Muhlberg, the cavalry had shamefully abandoned the Elector, and the Elector had been captured by the Emperor, Jonas sent this letter to Duke Albrecht of Prussia (on May 24, 1549) as astrange prophecy.

To the highly famous man, Mr. Justus Jonas, Doctor of Theology, Provost at Wittenberg, Christ's messenger in the church at Halle, his superior in the Lord. 

Grace and peace! | have received your letter, my dear Jonas, at the same time as the Roman copy about Luther, who was condemned 25 years ago. What do you think has been written, said, done and undertaken in any way in the meantime to our death and destruction? What are they still sending out today? And their raging against us is equal to their eternal fire, as the Scripture predicts, because even in hell they will not cease to hate and blaspheme the Son of God. Praise be to God, who has separated us from their community through His holy and blessed profession. 

What you write about the Emperor's affairs, the same we have, and nothing else, namely that the Frenchman fled with his troops and refused to fight. But | suspect that he had recourse to the advice and cunning of Fabius Maximus and the door.

We must be careful not to use a wedge that wearies the enemy by procrastination, and not to fight unless there is some prospect of victory where necessity does not compel it. Meanwhile, we are exhausted by the cost and by weariness. 

But | do not know whether you have heard this beautiful thing. It is said that the emperor said to the Duke of Julich: "| have spent more money on your captains than on the whole war. The Duke of Orange, who is full of Nassau, is said to have said the same thing to him: "Oh, dear sir, what do you want to get with the Emperor? your captains give him more than the whole war. | beg you, what will finally happen to princes and kings through this appalling disloyalty and treachery? With gold, not with the sword, the wars are waged. They take pay from their princes and gifts from the enemy. By this bravery the Frenchman is said to have gained Luxembourg, since the French leader promised and paid the imperial twenty thousand ducats that he should surrender defeated and hand over the city. Who does not suspect that Ferdinand, with the same luck, has now fought for the third time in Hungary? Yes, it is said that Andrew of Doria had a secret agreement with Barbarossa on the sea and said: "Let us be friends with each other; why should we destroy each other? O heroic and more than heroic valor to wear out kings and princes and nations! For what will the poor common people keep at last, since they are forced to fill these gullets insatiable for gold? We will also feel this infernal rapacity in our purse in a short time. 

Finally, it is written that the Turk raged in Weissenburg (? Alba regali), 1) slaughtering three thousand citizens, and also old men, and likewise the preachers, so that the heaps of corpses were higher than the walls. Satan fears and feels the day of his judgment beforehand. What do you think he thinks about us? He rages,

because he has only little time. The Lord protect his own, or rather, he governs them at the same time with us through his joyful spirit, so that we, may we live or be slain, bravely laugh at the raging of that [evil spirit]. 

The emperor, they say, wants to reinstate the Duke of Brunswick, | do not know by what means. Let us pray for our princes. For | have no doubt that if a war should arise, our Centaurs will do the same as the Julichers, namely, they will sell the princes and accept gold after having exhausted them first. "Only money! Lords remain lords." This is nowadays the custom and the salvation of the Niphlim, 2) not to stand in danger, not to spend anything for the fatherland, but they want to become rich and devour everything under the pretext and on the occasion of wars. "Feed on the devil's name, hell will fill you up!" Come, Lord Jesus, come, hear the groaning of your Church, hasten your coming, the evil rises to the highest. "It must break," Amen. | wrote this so that | would not write nothing. Fare well and teach the little church to pray for the day of the Lord, for better times are over.

No. 3074. 


(Wittenberg.) (December 20, 1543.) 


Concerns about the Brunswick cause, jointly with Bugenhagen and Melanchthon. 


At the location indicated in the previous number. In Burkhardt, p. 435 ff, in the note. 


If one would take action from the land of Brunswick, and otherwise due to other circumstances the matter would be directed to peace, whether for the sake of peace the article of religion is to be concealed and not to be disputed, or whether this article is to be respected so highly that because of it these lords and lands are to be put into strife and extreme danger and to wage wars, which no one can see an end to, from which devastation of the German nation is to be feared, as Grecia and other lands have been terribly devastated by war among themselves 2c., This is especially a difficult question, for warfare is not everyone's art, 


and to conclude in such matters, the Holy Spirit alone is the right counsel; human thoughts can easily be hideously lacking in this, for divine punishments are many. 

But, to speak according to the rule, this is the truth. If these lords and estates consider that they truly and fundamentally had the right to take the land of Brunswick, and that they ruled it diligently and praiseworthily, and had a serious regard for churches and schools, and thus sought God's praise, and respected their property to some extent in this way, so that they could protect the country with God's help, it is right and necessary not only not to conceal the article of religion, but also, in the event that force is taken, to protect the churches in the country as their own churches. And as David would have done wrong, if he had willingly given one or more spots to the idolaters, where he had to assume that idolatry would be established again: So in this case it is also wrong to give the land again into the hands of Brunswick, and with concealment again allow idolatry, unjust teaching and persecution, and with the weak confusion of their consciences, chasing away or murder of the Christian priests, their wives, poor children, item, others who do not want to accept idolatry again. Against this concealment actually speak these following sayings, which are rightly dressed, and are the actual rules of such things and cases. Matth. 10, 32. f.: "Whoever confesses me before men, him will | confess before my heavenly Father; but whoever denies me before men, him will | also deny before my heavenly Father." Matth. 12, 30.: "He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth." Gal. 2:18: "If | build again that which | have broken off, | make myself a transgressor." Rom. 1, 32.: The doers and the approvers are equally guilty of death. Matth. 18, 6: "If any of the least of these offend one that believeth on me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the sea, where it is deepest." Matth. 25, 24. ff. the servant is rejected and condemned [, who buries his penny. 


2936 


had]. 1) Ezekiel 34:2, "Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves. Shall not the shepherds feed the flock?" Isa. 5, 22. f.: "Woe to you who speak right to the wicked" 2c. 

These sayings are the rule, from both of which it is clear that one cannot consent to unrighteous teaching, idolatry, and persecution again being wrought in the land [and that one owes protection]. 2) 

There are, however, a number of things attached to it, namely, that it is not a public impossibility, for in this case the gospel gives the same teaching to the rulers and the subjects, namely, that we should be ready to suffer if we are defenseless, as Christ says Matt. 16:24: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. As an example: When Maximianus persecuted the Christians in the Orient, he overran the Armenians, who had been subject to the Romans for some time, but had adopted Christian teachings. But because they saw public tyranny, and the cities nevertheless had a regiment, they faithfully joined together and protected themselves against Maximianum, their emperor, and victory and happiness were with the Armenians. This was right, for the cause was just, and there was quite a fortune. But where there is no such fortune, and human protection is gone, one must do as the prophets, apostles and many saints have done at all times. 

At the same time Maximiani had a magistrate in Phrygia, Adauctus, a praiseworthy, noble gentleman who ruled well. He had adopted Christian doctrine and had abolished idolatry in his entire city, and ruled the city with Christian doctrine and discipline. This reached Maximianum, who sent a war party against Adauctum. Now there was a public impossibility of resistance. Therefore, he sent in the army, which killed him and other Christians and burned the town, as described by Eusebius in the 8th book.

Now where this impossibility is, an authority is excused for not protecting, as Christ says, Luc. 11:41: Give elemosyns of your ability; Paul also says the same in 2 Cor. 8 [v. 11]. 

And especially with negation and wars, not only the ability, but also the measure of each one's grace is to be considered: as not all are simultaneously gifted by God with strength of body, with speech, so not all are made by God for blissful wars, as Alexander, Julius. 

Therefore St. Paul says Rom. 12, 3: "Let each one know the measure of his grace and gift, and let him not reach higher than his gift. 

Now it is not our place to know the lords opportunity, but we can well see that this matter is not to be decided by one or two alone, but by many estates, and whether they all agree and are willing, the lords themselves will consider; but this is indicated by us, that one may know where one is indebted for protection, and that one must have patience in case of impossibility. 

The people of Israel were so severely afflicted in Egypt that even their young children were killed, and the tyranny lasted for 80 years. Then God raised up Moses so that they would have a captain who would succeed. So such things are not according to human suggestions, but from divine activity, if luck is to be there.

To which His Holiness graciously replied: although, especially at this time, there is a great lack of such persons in the university, His Holiness wishes to give greater consideration to the need of the church at Hall, and to allow Doctor Jonae to remain at Hall for another year, but with the proviso that he substitutes a legatee here, and decrees that he receive 60 fl. from his income here. We have sent this reply from our most gracious lord to the esteemed Doct. Chiliano, our good friend, who will report it to Your Worship. At the same time, we have also wanted to attribute it to E. W.. For what we know how to do to promote and serve the Christian Church in Hall, E. W. will find us willing to do to the best of our ability. May the eternal God, Father of our Savior JEsu Christ, graciously protect, govern and preserve your churches.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther, Bugenhagen and Melanchthon. 


(Regest.) 


The Elector reports that he has received their concern (No. 3074). He declares himself willing to provide the churches and schools in Brunswick with the necessary supplies, and instructs Bugenhagen to inquire of the superintendent employed in Brunswick where there is a shortage, and to inform the Elector accordingly. 


The concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, p.1122. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 437.

Concerns about a council of the cities in the Brunswick matter, jointly with Bugenhagen. 


It seems that a town meeting took place in Constance, and the town of Constance sent in its council. Luther and Bugenhagen spoke out against it. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, p. 1122. 9th chancery hand with original signatures. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 438. 

The council of the Duchy of Brunswick in Costentz says that it would be laudable not to give the land out of one's hands or to cede it by some means, and [they] complain about this to their consciences. Now it is true: it would be praiseworthy if one wanted to preserve the hut and do what belongs to it; but to argue about it alone and not want to do anything or little about it is not enough. And the matter is highly weighted down with words in the reported council, as Demosthenes puffs up his speech that it is very inglorious for the praiseworthy city of Athens, which has waged such great wars and defeated the foreign nations, to make peace with the king of Macedonia. To such speeches also belong willing people who want to add their goods, life and limb, and do not push other people forward. We have not heard anything about whether the cities 1) were thus minded. Now we do not want to dispute what "laudable" means, but what is necessary and what concerns the conscience. 2) What is necessary is what God has commanded, and each class is obliged to do according to its profession or ability. 


1) This passage has led us to the assumption that a so-called city council had taken place at Constance, on whose behalf this city had sent the council. Burkhardt in his table of contents only says: "Bedenken Uber den von der Stadt Costnitz eingesandten Rathschlag" 2c. 

2) Here Burkhardt has no interpunction sign.

2943 


Kings, princes and sovereigns are commanded to protect Christians against Turks or tyrants as far as anyone can. If, however, a pious ruler, who would gladly give his body and goods, has no help from others, or if private individuals are abandoned, they do right to accept a tolerable peace, which God's word does not forbid, with the enemies, to whom they alone are too weak, as Judah accepted peace with the Romans, who left them their temple and worship, although it would have been much more beautiful and praiseworthy if they had chased Herod and Pilate out of Judea, as Esaias chased Sanherib. There were also some holy people at the time when Esaias was, namely Mary, John Baptist and others. But this time should not have such great honor, because it was the time of punishment, therefore the people did not stick together, as it is unfortunately now, that nothing sticks together. And this case of Brunswick is quite equal to the Elemosyns. For the fact that these estates took the land from the tyrant out of right causes and brought it to right teaching, this is a high, God pleasing elemosyna. Now no one is obliged to give elemosyna above his ability, as Christ says: Prayer elemosyna 2c., and Paul 2 Cor. 8 says, one should give so that we do not suffer need, and others have lazy days. So a gentleman is not guilty of neglecting, putting in danger and spoiling his own churches and country, so that others who should be working with him may have gentle rest. Further, Paul also says that one should give elemosyns, each first to his relatives. Thus a gentleman is obliged to help his country and his people first, and then, as much as he is able, others as well. And there are many of these sayings in God's Word, which teach that each one should take care of his house, his land, his profession and his office; in this diligence God gives blessings and happiness. It is beyond human ability to rule one's own house; but because the householder remains in his profession, and this is his own and necessary work, God is there and helps to keep house. But if the householder wants to burden himself with many other people's things, that is out of the rule, God is not always there. It is true that

land lies with those who do not want to help, but rather drag themselves out, and want to blame misfortune, danger, costs, and damage on a few. We also want to assume that the emperor would have proposed these two things, to agree to sequestration or to wait for war; and to assume that such a proposal would be a true seriousness, as one nevertheless sees that the emperor has strange suggestions: what should a preacher, whom one asks for advice, answer? Should he advise war in the fatherland, so that no one can see no head, no end, no means? Thus the histories remind us, when such fires once start, that after that one burns for and for another. How Athens, Sparta, Corcyra, Platea, Argos, Thebe have ruined themselves one after the other! Therefore we cannot and should not advise war, except for the public necessity of resistance. But if there are people whom God has awakened, he will give it into their hands and does not need to ask. If God wants to make a salutary change in the world through war, he will give the beginning to it in such a way that we must defend ourselves and not hurry to do so. Yes, some say, then it is too short, and we will be overhasty. All this is human fidgeting and faintheartedness, and is contrary to the teaching in the 46th Psalms [v. 11]: "Stand still, and you will see that | am God" 2c. And Moses says: "Stand still, and you will see the glory of God. The wisdom and strength of Christians is not to hurry without a certain calling, but to stand still in faith and await the time.

To the highly esteemed and worthy men, 1) the servants of the Word of God in Nordhausen, his exceedingly dear brothers in the Lord. 


Grace and peace in Christ. Dear men! You see for yourselves how great unrest Satan is stirring up everywhere in the church, in that there are almost as many opinions as there are heads of the church servants. Therefore, a certain rumor has also reached me that insignificant questions about very trivial things have also arisen among you. For in regard to the epitome of right doctrine (summa _ pietatis) your reputation is still unharmed. Nevertheless, just as the rabble is crude and despises the whole doctrine of godliness, so it easily seizes the opportunity to disparage and blaspheme even the highest articles of the faith, especially among those who are papists, who fan the flames and stir up bitterness and blow up a conflagration from a little spark. Therefore, for the sake of Christ, in whom we live and of whom we boast, 2) in whose Spirit we are one, | beg you to recognize and consider the grace of God, by which he has made us one and has kept us so far in the epitome of right doctrine 3) and the chief articles, and, as Paul [1 Cor. 10, 32], give no one offense in these outward and indifferent (indifferentibus) things, even (as the papists are now raging) with speeches that are harmful and dangerous to the weak, but pernicious to the hardened. Thus Christ will be the one 4) and reigns among all, whose death and blood we must cheaply prefer to our thoughts, or rather to the temptations of the devil. But as He has begun His work in you, so maintain and accomplish it until that day in which we hope, amen.

Luther speaks out about the beneficial use of spiritual goods. 


From a copy in Cod. Goth. 40, fol. 211, printed by Burkhardt, p. 441.-The occasion is not known. 


Grace and peace in the Lord. Strict, firm, dear Lord, good friend! | have indeed been so overloaded with letters and business this time that | have not been able to do any of them before the others, and everything must go through my head and hand alone. That is why | have delayed answering you. That some grumble that my most gracious lord sells the ecclesiastical goods (as they are called) does not annoy me, because his churf. G. has otherwise done great damage to them, as it is tried with visitators and sequestrators, who have not been able to be sated, and yet the monasticism cannot be restored, one can truly not do otherwise. Also, S. ch. G. is to receive the evangelion with daily lists and messages and the like, an excellent great fare, which is all too heavy for the country. This is also a good thing, that such goods come among the nobility, 6) and especially to those who need it, because the very rich do not need it. The rich do not need it. Therefore, those who are angry about this and see the mote in another's eye should first look at their beam. Tell me, what use is the entire Wirzburg Abbey to the church, as are all abbeys? Here schools, parishes, hospitals are provided for the Word of God and churches, there such large estates serve the devil and the persecution of the divine word; here the monastery is poor, the brothers are many, there the monasteries are rich and the lords are wavy. Therefore, they would like to grant us such a poor beggar's sack in God's honor (even if not everything would be pure), so we must grant that they

Then | brought her before me and inquired who she was; so she confessed to me that she was the daughter of a burgher in Minderstadt in Franconia, who had been beheaded in the peasants’ revolt, and that she had thus gone astray as a poor child; she asked me to forgive her for God's sake and to have mercy on her. Then | commanded her to abstain from such lies with the name of Truce. But since | am sure, | do not know any other way, because she does 3) so; then she causes all kinds of evil and fornication behind me, also in my house; cheats all people with the name of Truchses, so that after | have found out, since she got away, | cannot think any other way, than that she was inflicted on me by the papists, as an arch-whore, desperate brat and liar, who did me all harm in the cellar, kitchens, chambers, and yet no one could be guilty. Who knows what she had in mind more than | had her with me in my chambers and with my children in great trust. In the end, she pulled some of them to herself and became pregnant from the kill, and asked my maid to jump on her body to kill the fruit. So she escaped from me by the mercy of my maidservant, otherwise she would not have deceived me again, because the Elbe would not have had water. Therefore, my request to all of you is to have such a princess in your sight, and let her be commanded to you, and let her ask where she is from, finally, where it cannot be otherwise, do not let the cursed whore brat, lying, thieving wretch, in honor of the gospel and also for my service, suffer with you, so that yours are also safe from her devilish deception, thievery, deceivers. | am almost afraid that she would have deserved more than one death, as many witnesses are found after her departure. | want to tell you this in good faith, so that it will not remain on my conscience, where | would have remained silent, to tell you this.

To the highly famous man, M. Georg Spalatin, superintendent of the churches in Meissen, pastor of the church in Altenburg, his brother who is extremely dear to the Lord. 

Grace and peace! You write, as it seems to me, a little too excited about your little book, my dear Spalatin, as if it were hiding where you know nothing about it. And | do not hold this affection for the child of your spirit against you, but rather praise it most highly, and have joked sweetly with me about your so sincere good will. But you should know that your work does not hide, since | have given it to be printed. But all the presses 1) are so overwhelmed with books that it cannot be produced as quickly as you would like. Perhaps you do not believe that we are so busy here because you, as an absentee, do not see our misery. | confess to you that in this new year | have been received in such a way that in my life | have been

| have never been more troubled in the whole matter of the gospel. For | get into a very fierce trade with the lawyers because of the secret engagements, and those whom | had hoped to be reliable friends of the Gospel, | experience as the fiercest enemies. Should this not torment me, | beg you, my dear Spalatin? Therefore have patience with me, or with my negligence, if you think so. For if | did not adore and love you from the bottom of my heart, | would not have written this letter to you either, with my so great plagues. Nevertheless, as much as is in me, your booklet will be taken care of, because it pleases me well, as | wrote earlier. Be well and pray for the Church, that is, for us. Internal enemies do more harm than external ones, like Judas among the apostles; but the crucified one triumphs, and the crucifier perishes, amen. Greetings to your very dear wife. 

Behold, there my Kathe, if dll not have it before, sends a root against the stone, which, as it seems to me, is effective, for it has benefited both me and many others; it may also be tried. Again, be well, my dear Spalatin, and do not be moved by any suspicion, as if | despised your works. You are an old tried and tested one among my best friends, whom | would least of all despise, especially as an old man who is already at the grave. You do this again, that you interpret my customs or my ways, or (if it pleases you) my business and troubles kindly and sincerely, and do not doubt, even if some appearance should interfere, that you are and will be exceedingly dear to me. Again, be well in the Lord. Wednesday after Paul's conversion [30 Jan.] 1544.

To the respectable Mr. Joachim Morlin, Doctor of Theology, your faithful, right 1) and fair Bishop of the Church at Géttingen, his in Christ exceedingly dear brother. 


We wish you happiness in your profession, my dear Doctor, and we invoke the rich blessing of the Holy Spirit for you and the people of Géttingen, that you may produce much fruit to the glory of God. Go in peace, and the Lord be with you, Amen. If the council of Arnstadt should desire someone from us, they will not find us as they would like, as | have written to a citizen there, Peter Walzdorf. For their ingratitude and wickedness annoys me very much, God will repay them. By the way, may you be especially mindful in your church to urge the people to pray and supplicate for the imperial diets and for the churches, for each individual prince of our confession, and likewise for the emperor, that he be ruled by a good spirit, for Satan is raging terribly, as credible news of him is written to us. The Frenchman has attacked the emperor anew, having taken away a certain good city by fraud. The Pope, the Venetians, and the Turk have joined with him, and they receive Barbarossa, the leader of the Turkish fleet; they pay [for the army] 2) 300,000 gold florins (coronatorum) every month. Then the French gave a certain port to Barbarossa, and a Mahometan temple is built there, with the approval of the pope. This is how the head of the Church and the most Christian king of the Church work for the Church. This is how they use the money for the church, which has been squeezed out of the indulgences, the annals and innumerable revenues of all churches against the Turk in so many years. O over the times! O over Satan! Come, O Lord JEsu, come! It is time for the Lord to intervene, amen. Fare well in the Lord with your own. On Dorothea's Day [6 Feb.] 1544.

Luther speaks out about the very evil times and reports news.

To the highly esteemed and worthy man, Mr. M. 

Anton Lauterbach, Bishop of the Church at Pirna, his extremely dear brother in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! He sits at the right hand of the Father, whom we preach, confess and worship. He will see to it that the counsels and schemes of his enemies are turned aside and brought to nought, as the second Psalm teaches; let us do our part in teaching and praying. We will let them rage and rage against the Lord and his anointed. What in the Mark "Grickel and Jeckel" 3) are cooking, | do not know. May God make them well, amen. The shameful Jews rule in the Mark (ea) with the Margrave for the sake of money. They are also excluded at Prague by Ferdinand for the same reason. This is the fruit of the Centaurs, who, | believe, will be the last enemies of the Church, and at the same time the most pernicious, more avaricious than avarice itself, and more insatiable than hell itself. Christ will satisfy them, who will come next in glory, not with money, but with fire and brimstone of hell and the wrath of God. 

| received the spotted fish, or the canned trout. Thank Johann Schulteis in my name. How much bitterness Satan breathes in the poems you have sent! But he will do nothing against the Lord, only that he testifies that he is tormented by one of his worthy hatreds against the Son of God. Fare well in the Lord, who guides and sustains you together with Daniel [Cresser] and the other fellow servants of God, amen. Greetings

you my Kathe and all yours, and says that your care for the Borsdorf apples was not necessary. 

There is no news, only that it is said that Latorf was elected bishop of Merseburg, although Julius Pflug (Aratratus == the plowed) had several votes. The bishop of Cologne still insists on the Gospel. Prayers must be made for him to remain firm. The canons do not cease to rage against him. You know that one of us, who was not of us, M. Veit Amerbach, went to Ingolstadt to be Eck's successor in blaspheming our word, perhaps more than the latter did. For there is the dung puddle of all blasphemous people. The Lord is near; we shall not be anxious, amen. February 9, 1544. 

M. Luther, D. 


| tell you a monstrosity of this new year (the witnesses are extremely reliable): The French, the Pope, the Venetians, the Turk have formed a conspiracy against the Emperor and pay for the army every month three tons [gold], 300,000 gold florins (coronatorum). The Frenchman has_ granted Barbarossa, who is the commander of the Turkish fleet, a certain seaport, and there he has built a temple of Mahomet. He took away a good town from the emperor. These things you may sing to your followers of the pope. This 1) is the head of the most holy church who wanted to be worshipped, that one is the most Christian king of France. "There is now indulgence money", annals, income, the _ infinite robbery of all churches, the money, which is collected in so many years, "invested. Praise now to the, Pabst!" 

The history of this letter includes the news that after Luther's death Lauterbach gave the original of the letter to his friend Célestin, and wrote him the following about it: 

Esteemed man and respectable doctor, esteemed friend! This letter, which the holy man, Mr. D. M. Luther, wrote to me some years ago with a sincere heart, which contains his complaints against Eisleben, the great hypocrite and false man, the perverse antinomer,2) likewise complains that

To the man highly esteemed in the Lord, M. Georg Spalatin, bishop and pastor of the churches of Altenburg and Meissen, his extremely dear brother. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! | certainly believed, my dear Spalatin, that | would have answered your questions about usury. For | am aware that | had thought of it and had intended to answer you. But this is what happens to me every day in other matters as well, since | am busy with so many trades and miseries. To the point. Your questions about the usury of grain cannot be settled by any particular provision, given the great diversity of times, persons, places, events or incidents. Therefore, it must be left to the pleasure of each one to consider the natural law and thus think: Would you like that what you do to another be done to you? for "this is the law and the prophets," says Christ, Matth. 7, 12. At the same time, a good conscience will also pay attention to what is written in Proverbs 11:26: "People curse him who stores up grain, but blessings come to him who sells it," and what Amos 8:5 says of the miser: "That we increase

To the man venerable in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus, the right and exceedingly faithful bishop of the church at Naumburg, his [friend] highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! That you write, my bishop venerable in the Lord, that it pleased you that | did not leave for you in this hard winter, was very pleasant to me. And indeed, this winter seems to me to be the longest of all that | have experienced in my life. What God may be thinking of, | do not know. Whether perhaps nature and the unusual course of all creatures prophesy to us that the day of redemption is at the door? But | will hurry to you as soon as | can spare the time, God willing. For | can easily create leisure for myself, at least with such health. For | wish to see and speak to you myself before | fall asleep.

They themselves, however, are princes. 2) But in all classes of men there is indomitable avarice, so that | firmly persuade myself that this is one of the signs of the last day, as if the world were racing in its old age and last death struggle and would soon perish, as it tends to happen with some dying people. But about that at another time. 

| believe that you know all the news about how the pope has made an alliance with the Turk and the French and the Venetians, and will wage war against the emperor. The Frenchman has given a seaport to Barbarossa, the commander of the Turkish fleet, who is building a Mahometan temple there. O over the most Christian king! 0 over the most holy father! o over the most catholic Venetians! Where are now the innumerable funds that have been collected against the Turk from the pallia, annals, letters of confession, indulgences, etc.? Of course, they serve for the Turk against the Christians. You see, therefore, that the world hastens its end, and, as philosophy says, the natural movement is slower in the beginning, very swift in the end. But this | write perhaps in vain, since you may have learned this from others. It is written to Speier that our prince was most graciously exempted by the emperor, in that Frederick of the Palatinate was sent to meet him with the great men of the imperial court, and he was escorted with splendid splendor and entered the city. God grant an even happier end, amen. Other things at another time, when | will have learned more, or | can tell it to you myself verbally. They say that the Turk has died, and that his sons will fight for the dominion. Would to God that this were true, for this too would be among the other signs that the world would soon come to an end. Fare well in the Lord, who may strengthen you and give you that this captivity of the flesh of yours may appear to you as the most delightful paradise, because in this episcopal office you serve His pleasing will, amen.

The Lord will be with you, | pray and wish, amen. My Kathe thanks you for your kindness. But Alexius was mistaken when he wrote to you about stakes and Borsdorf seedlings; she did not desire stakes, but supports for the vines, in German: "Weinpfahle," if you could send ten shocks of them, or about that much.

Grace and peace in the Lord and my poor Paternoster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! | humbly request, as | am obliged to do, for the good man Johann Schreiner, pastor of Grimma (Grym), that E. C. F. G. graciously grant a scholarship to his son, who has now grown and is well prepared for school. For he who has many children, namely eight alive, is not able to maintain those in the studio. Thus he himself is truly a fine man, who has kept quiet and well for so many years, and has faithfully served the church in Grimma for 22 years. He has been my monastic companion or brother almost from his youth and has become a magister here. Further, it is not necessary to remind E. C. F. G. how one must always draw church servants; the old ones pass away, the young ones grow old, die as easily as the old ones, and there is still no remaining supply, because E. C. F. G. know this best themselves, and experience teaches it well. C.F.G. will know how to show mercy, | have no doubt. The merciful God, who has burdened E. C. F. G. with a great burden in this unfaithful, cursed time, will (and will also) graciously hear our heart's pleas and sighs, as He has committed Himself to us, so only believe, and He will help E. C. F. G. to govern and do good, although not all evil can be prevented. He remains the overlord, vowed forever, amen. Wednesday after the Conception of our Lord Christ [March 26].

For it seems as if it wants to become evil. God help his own, amen. | can well believe that E. C. F. G. also reports how she is bored because our gracious Lord, E. C. F. G. husband, is absent; but because necessity demands it, and such absence happens for the benefit and good of Christendom and the German nation, we must bear it with patience according to the divine will.

We have the dear Word of God, which comforts and sustains us in this life, and promises and brings us that life of blessedness. Thus we also have prayer, which we know (as E. C. F. G. also wrote) will be answered and granted in its time. Such two unspeakable jewels the devil, the Turk, the pope and his own cannot have, and are in this much poorer and more miserable than any beggar on earth. Of this we may certainly boast and take comfort, for which we should also give thanks to God, the Father of all mercies, in Christ Jesus, His dear Son, our Lord, that He has given us such a precious, blessed treasure and called us unworthy ones to such a treasure by His rich grace, that we, on the other hand, should not only see and tolerate temporal evil, but also have mercy on the blind, wretched world, especially on such high and great leaders in the world, that they are deprived of such graces and are not yet worthy to have them. God enlighten them once, so that they may also see, recognize and desire it with us, amen. My Kathe offers her poor Father-Our to E. C. F. G. with all her subservience, and thanks very much that E. C. F. G. so graciously remembers her. Hiemit dem lieben GOtte befohlen, Amen. Judica [March 30] 1544. E. C. F. G. undersigned Mart. Luther, D.

K. M.. K. M. chancellor. Now letters have often been written to E. K. M., by myself as well; but we think he has embezzled the letters, and they say he keeps himself like a grass, when he is nothing more than a burgher, the son of a furrier (Korsner) in Frankfurt am Main, which is publicly the truth. So now the poor woman asks, and | also ask for God's sake, that His Holiness will set the boy to rights, or help that the poor woman receive a fair amount of entertainment from his goods, as is fair: for he has brought her into such misery that she almost has to look for begging bread from her friends, and she is also almost oppressed, [and almost] 1) by

To the highly famous man, Mr. Justus Jonas, 

Doctor of Theology, Provost at Wittenberg, envoy of the Lord to Halle in Saxony, his most esteemed superior. 

Grace and peace! | have nothing, my dear Jonas, what | could write, only that | ask and hope that the day of our redemption is near. For everywhere the whole world is so moved and shattered, the Word is so struggling with the gates of hell that it is necessary, 


that this movement of the bodies and minds must bring about a very great change of things. For in this way the world cannot exist or remain. According to this, those unbelievable monstrosities, namely the alliances of the most Christian (rather the most wicked) king and of the most holy (rather the most terrifying 1)) Pabst with the Turk, something the like of which has not been seen in many centuries. Who would have thought that we would come to these times and see such terrifying things? Of these eclipses and signs the mathematicians have foretold nothing, but only he who says: And there will be great signs. In truth, these are signs, they are truly great. Let us pray and rise up with our heads lifted up; our salvation is drawing near, amen. 

Those diseases have also prevailed in this city. 2) All my children have suffered from them at the same time. All my children have suffered them at the same time, and of them my Margarethlein has contracted a fever and still suffers great heat. 

The Frenchman is said to have about thirty thousand Turks in France, not from Asia, but from Africa, and it is believed that he wants to invade Luxembourg or even Trier. God have mercy on us. Germany will be exhausted by heavy impositions. Summa, these are the beginnings of the evils, God wanted, also the end of the sins and this death, amen. 

Greet your wife and all yours and ours. Fare well in the Lord. Thursday, Easter week [April 17] 1544.

To the brethren who are highly esteemed in Christ, to the ministers of the Word in Eperies and the neighboring places, to the loud and exceedingly faithful [friends] who are very dear in the Lord. 

Grace and peace. In the Lord, men to be revered! | have read your sorrowful letters with excessive sorrow in my heart, since | see such great wrath of God, rather such great guilt of our sins, which have compelled God to send such a terrible raging of the Turks against us. May He grant that we may be restored and, after repentance, atone for this wrath, or, if it is absolutely determined that it will be so, may He grant that this will be the last wrath and one of the great signs before the day of His glory and our blessedness, as He has said: And there shall be great 1) signs. Let it be done, amen. 

By the way, what you wrote about Matthias Devay surprised me very much, since he also has such a good name with us, so that it is difficult for me to believe what you write. But however it may be, he certainly did not get the doctrine of the Sacramentirans from us. We are constantly fighting against it here, publicly and especially, and there is no suspicion or even the slightest trace of this abomination among us, unless the devil is murmuring in some hidden corner. Perhaps you are moved by the fact that we have given up the elevation of the host as a favor to some neighbors, not out of necessity, because from the beginning we wanted it to be considered free, and even now we refrain from it, not in order to deny our doctrine of the Sacrament, Rather, we leave it free for others, even among our Church, and we ourselves will re-establish it if it should be necessary or useful, as the whole Church of Milan does not use the canon or the elevation, even to this day, although the whole Roman Church does otherwise; and yet there is no offense there. Therefore 


1) Instead of mea we have assumed magna. Walch also read it that way. Cf. no. 3113. 





stand firm and do not doubt that | will never (unless God allows me to become furious) stand with the opponents of the Sacrament, nor will | suffer this abomination in the Church entrusted to me. Or if | should do otherwise (which God forbid), say confidently that | am furious and damned. It is the devil, who, knowing that | am invincible in public, since so many of my books are available as witnesses, is intent on bringing me into ill gossip in the corners with his! serpentine and furtive hisses wherever he can, and to deface the word of truth under the pretense of my name. Therefore, after my so many confessions, | am forced to make one more, which | will do soon, and that is the last one). 

| have absolutely no suspicion of M. Philip, not even of any of us. For, as | have said, Satan does not even dare to make a noise in public. Let us pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will shortly put an end to this last and exceedingly wicked world, which has come to its highest point, so that it no longer seems to be able to suffer itself. Come, Lord Jesus, amen. In him you are well. Given at Wittenberg, Monday after Quasimodogeniti [April 21] 1544.

But this is our consolation, that the victory is always with him who treads down, against him who bites, as it is written, "He shall tread down thy head." Therefore you do right and have the right opinion that you must watch against external enemies and against the wolves in the neighborhood and at home; these are the teeth of the serpent, namely the molars, as the prophet says Ps. 58, 7. But | am very busy, already old and worn out, and indeed wish for rest, which | think is a deserved one, but my wish is little fulfilled.

This and the missive of May 30 refer to the dispute which arose between the two Pomeranian dukes Barnim IX of Stettin and his nephew Philip 1 of Wolgast over the reoccupation of the bishopric of Camin, which had been terminated by the death of Bishop Erasmus Manteufel, and have the purpose of preventing the election of the seventeen-year-old Count of Eberstein proposed by Duke Barnim on the recommendation of Duke Ernst of Luiineburg.

God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Savior before. Illustrious, highborn, gracious princes and lords! First of all, we ask Your Highness in submission that you graciously hear our writing, which is meant with true Christian faithfulness and to no one's detriment or advantage, and not because we want to force ourselves on others, but because we know that both Your Highness and Your Lordship, as noble Christian princes and lords, are in favor of us. F. G., as sovereign Christian princes, do not seek or desire anything higher in their government and their lives than that the right knowledge of God and invocation be planted and maintained through F. G.'s rule, and that their subjects be called to eternal blessedness and be properly instructed. And we have heard that the Duke of Camin is not in agreement about the election of a bishop, we, as we are also obliged to care for the Christian church, have considered with humble goodwill before this time to write our simple Christian remembrance to both the Duke of Camin in this matter, which we are now promoting by your, Duke Philippsen's, envoy's report, envoy's report; and we ask in submission that Your Holiness will graciously listen to this reminder,

and move with diligence, and above all promote God's glory, and the salvation and need of poor scattered Christendom; and this is our concern: 

First of all, itis quite certain and without doubt that E. F. G. as Dukes of Pomerania and as God's ordained sovereigns are obliged to decree with the utmost seriousness that the churches in the entire duchy and its lands, also in the diocese of Calvin, be properly and Christianly staffed and supplied with competent persons and proper maintenance of the same; for thus says the Psalm: You princes shall open the gates of the world, that the King of honor may enter. 

Now, both of them, together with their laudable regions, have considered a Christian order, especially with which form and to which office a bishop is to be elected at Camin at all times, and how the cathedral chapter, for the preservation of Christian life and other useful studies, is to remain and be preserved in its essence, which order of both of them we also consider to be good and useful, as far as we are informed, and so that the churches would not be neglected. For this is true and public, that a bishop, as an overseer, is to spread the pure Christian truth of the Gospel, and to teach it himself, as all holy bishops of old did, item, to visit the churches, to ordain competent persons, to take care of the study, to govern the marriage courts and other ecclesiastical courts, and to administer Christian discipline, for which first of all the dioceses are founded, is to be used properly, and with these mentioned ministries can work and exalt much good to God's praise; And especially in these last times, in which the world is becoming raw and wild, and the Turks are not far from us, it is highly necessary that there be diligent, serious, understanding overseers, who wisely build up the churches and keep them together, so that they may exist fervently. 

Since, after the death of Bishop Erasmi, the Holy Father is now to appoint another, whose age and ability to govern are to be respected, by virtue of the established inheritance contracts and orders, we ask, in submission and for the sake of God, that both Holy Fathers unanimously appoint such a person to the episcopal office, as is reported, who will be the bishop. 


2978 


He was willing and inclined to exercise the episcopal offices, to teach the gospel, the visitation, the government, the spiritual courts and the discipline. 

But that there has been disagreement in this matter, we are truly shocked, considering that this disagreement is not only harmful and annoying now, but also sets a bad example for the future; and if such disagreement has occurred now and as soon as in the first nomination after the establishment of the order, what is there to worry about for forty or more years? 

And that in the one nomination the young Count of Eberstein, who is known to us, is appointed, although we do not know how to punish the said Count and Lord, as a young gentleman of his manners, in this his youth, and we grant him all the best, nevertheless his age and mind is not yet capable of the episcopal office for many years, therefore it is fair to reject this nomination of the young Count for the following reasons: 

First of all, if one wants to elect church regents, everyone is obliged to follow Paul's rule, which he wrote to Timotheo, primae Timoth. tertio, and Tito ad Titum |. and earnestly commanded to elect such a person who can perform the office himself; and without sin no one can consent to appoint or elect such a person whom he knows to be still long unfit for the office, and not so earnestly studied as to be afterwards fit to preach, teach, shut up the adversaries of the gospel with the truth of the holy Scriptures, and to advocate pure truth, also to exercise other church offices 2c. 

For this commandment in St. Paul's writings is not to be dismissed and disregarded as words that should be spoken only for appearances, but they are serious divine commands, the disregard of which is punished with eternal wrath, if one persists in sin, and with temporal plagues, as the examples are before us, where the great lords have given the bishoprics to children and other unlearned and despisers of Christian offices. There the right doctrine has been destroyed, and idolatry and fornication have grown, which God punishes with wars and _ various disruptions.

2979 


On the other hand, Paul says 1 Timothy. 5: Thou shalt not easily ordain any man to the church office, nor make thyself partaker of the sins of others. Whoever then appoints or elects a person who cannot hold the office, what that person fails to do and corrupts, he who has exalted him to it is guilty of. 

Now we ask, E. F. G. want to hear and accept this warning, and not to put themselves in this way before God, so that they make themselves guilty of all negligence, which would follow from the knowing nomination of an unintelligent boy, and also do not want to make themselves guilty of annoyance. For with such an unjust nomination, the previous examples of despised election 1) would be approved, and the like would be strengthened for the time being, as we know that in several other places in German lands at this time, much unreasonable practices are being carried out with the episcopal election. 

Thirdly, in the confession of the praiseworthy and Christian princes, which was made for the glory of God and the betterment of the churches, this abuse is especially punished, that the bishoprics are not provided with persons capable of the office, from which error and great sins and punishments have resulted in Christendom. Now, we have no doubt that both institutions are finally intent on keeping the articles of the Confession and not to act against them. However, this choice of children would cause a great rupture in a noble article of the Confession, and would not only strengthen the previous abuses, but the crude nature of this time would cause greater harm. For although in former times the bishops and officials did not respect the doctrine, the same time the officials, because of their enjoyment, had a fuss about some ceremonies and gross annoyances. Now there are no Officials, and all episcopal government, in large and small parts, lies in the mire; and if there is not a Christian ordination and visitation of the churches and schools, and an attention to the discipline and income of the churches, maintenance and protection of the

If the churchmen and schools are to be established with great seriousness, it is to be feared that a miserable pagan darkness and desolation will follow. And all men, kings, princes, noble and ignoble, scholars and unscholars, each in his profession and according to his ability, are truly guilty before God to take precautions against this pagan darkness now and to care for the descendants. 

Both of them, as noble Christian princes, want to consider this diligently, and not against God's command and against the Christian confession, to the detriment of the churches, to handle and strengthen the old abuse, especially because the damage is public. 

Both of them know that nowadays many churches, especially in the bishop's territories, stand desolate, without pastors, as if they were heathens, and that otherwise the visitation and church court are highly needed in the country. To rebuild so many fallen 


parishes, and to arrange the visitation and ecclesiastical court properly and usefully, truly requires a faithful, learned, understanding, 


experienced and practiced person. And are E. F. G. themselves owe this service to God, that they help in this Christian work with all seriousness. 

Fourthly, since this is the first example, according to established princely treaties of nomination, in which F. F. G. should present a praiseworthy example to all other countries that they seek God's honor and keep their own promise without sophistry, it would be exceedingly annoying if F. F. G, according to old abuse, wanted to nominate a person who, because of his youth and lack of understanding, is not yet capable. F. G. would want to nominate, according to old abuse, a person who, because of his youth and ignorance, is still lukewarm, or if, despite divine command and their own well-considered and Christian contracts, they did not want to compare themselves in the right way. 

E. F. G. want to consider God's wrath in this, who does not let such contempt go unpunished, if someone thinks that there is nothing great about the parishes, the visitation and other church matters, it is much more stately, if a principality raises their counts and the nobility to great estates, for which the bishoprics and cathedral chapters are to serve. 

But that God wants to show a serious wrath over this papal and pagan contempt, is very publicly proven by all the 





great wars and plagues that are before your eyes. Woe to you, says Esaias on the 5th, who seek great goods, pleasures, splendor and dominions, and neglect the offices that God has commanded you. 

And if one wants to argue against this, although E. F. G. were not compared to the nomination half of this time, then both E. F. G. would nevertheless have been ready for it. had already arranged, by virtue of established princely treaties, according to which each part had nominated a person, that this error would be decided by lot, therefore there is no need for another nomination, but one should leave it at this, and wait, to whom the lot will fall, that the same will be accepted and confirmed for a bishop, as given by God for this purpose, because God would certainly send it so, that the most suitable and useful person would be chosen, because the Scripture Proverb. 16 says: "The lot is cast by the Lord" 2c.; on the other hand, E. F. G. want to consider that in this whole matter not to play thus, and to tempt God, but that the said E. F. G. treaties are thus established and of the opinion that after a right Christian election and nomination of two persons, who by age and skill are fit for the episcopal office, the lot shall be cast, and in this the laudable example of the Apostles’ election Actor. 1, according to which there is no doubt that these contracts are thus considered and ordered by E. F. G.. For there we see that the apostles first named and presented two such men from among many persons, whom they considered to be the most capable, and then cast the lot over them with an appeal to God, so that he would show which of these two he would prefer to such an office. God has been present, and still wants to be present, and to give his blessing to it, where such an example is possible: If one seeks otherwise, then one must seek to know which of the two he would prefer to this office. But where one seeks otherwise, there will be little blessing and good. 

Therefore, only humbly and for the sake of God, we ask both E. F. G., as we are obligated to do so in our office, to please use our indicated opinion and cause for God's praise and own blessedness and for the benefit of the countries and people, which also may be 


2982 


are the people and souls for whom Christ shed his blood and suffered death, and grant our request and admonition. We know well how far our office and ability stretches, and do not presume higher than is due to us; we both ask and admonish and remind E. F. G. of God's earnest command. If our petitioning, exhorting and reminding does no good, we must command the matter to God. Nevertheless, we are urged by our office to complain about the princes' negligence and to punish those who mislead the princes in this matter to the detriment of Christianity through avarice with harsh writings. For we are certain that no one with God and a good conscience can advise or consent to such a choice of children. A properly ordered bishopric would be a useful jewel of the whole duchy and land of Pomerania and its neighborhood. 

Therefore, we again ask and admonish E. F. G. in submission and for the sake of God, that they do not want to nominate and elect a sham bishop or monkey work, but a true bishop who will take the office seriously. For in this nomination not only the preservation of the goods is to be considered, but first of all the office is to be considered, in which many great things are included, namely the teaching office, which a bishop himself is obliged to do, the interrogation of priests, examination and ordination, supervision of the teaching and ceremonies, visitation of the churches and schools, preservation of Christian discipline, with punishment of blasphemies, adultery, etc., Appointment of ecclesiastical courts in matrimonial cases, and in case of disputes concerning the law, and in sum, preservation of Christian law and discipline, so that it may be inherited by the descendants and not become pagan desolations. 

These things both want to consider E. F. G. of great importance, and to mean God's honor, their own bliss, and E. F. G.'s dukedom and lands benefit and welfare. F.G.'s dukedom and lands, and not to throw away the diocese as a party, regardless of the office. And finally, as we have no doubt, we both ask the F. G. to graciously hear this faithful and well-meant writing of ours, which is intended for no one's advantage or disadvantage, but only for God's glory. The

Luther rebukes Gilbert's clumsy expression, which gave rise to the assumption that he teaches that the divine nature also suffered in Christ.

Grace and peace! If you have said nothing else or in a different way, my dear Martin, than what you write, it would not be much to blame, except that this word, which you have used, that the whole (integrum) Christ suffered, consisting of two natures, may have given offence. Therefore you should rather have been careful that this should be said after the manner of the apostle. For although it is the same that the whole (integrum) Christ, consisting of two natures, suffered, and that that person of two natures suffered, and all this is right and true, yet 3) you would like to understand something else by the word integer, namely, that the Godhead was separate and suffered in a separate way, since it was also in humanity; this would be of no value. Therefore, you can clearly declare that you meant nothing else than that the person who is Christ, consisting of the divine and human natures, truly suffered, so that it may be said with truth: The Son of God, even the true God Himself suffered, because God is truly man, and man is truly God, in One Person, as Paul says in 1 Cor. 2, 4) 8.

To the well-born, noble, honorable, strict, counts and lords 2c., the enlightened, high-born princes and lords, Mr. Barnim and Mr. Philippsen, dukes of Pomerania 2c., together decreed councilors now and at Sweyna, our gracious and favorable lords. 

God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Savior before. Gracious, noble, honorable, strict and favorable lords! Your. Gracious and honorable lords, we would like to inform you that we, in good faith, have sent to the highborn princes and lords, Mr. Barnim and Mr. Philippsen, both dukes of Pomerania, our gracious lords, a petition concerning the nomination of a Christian bishop several weeks ago, which we were moved to do for Christian reasons, and partly out of a sense of duty to your fatherland. For when we heard that both of your F. G. were not in agreement about the nomination, we were truly very frightened by it, and both considered that due to the disagreement of both ruling princes there would be much hindrance in the regiment and great misery, item, that unjust appointment of the bishopric would cause eternal damage in the churches. 

Although we are lowly persons, our Lord and honorable friends know that God's command and order is that we, as preachers and teachers, should admonish both high and lowly classes for the preservation of divine knowledge and invocation. 

Therefore, we have sent a letter with the same wording to both Princes in submission, and after it was indicated to us that both your F. G. had decreed that some of your F. G.'s most distinguished councillors should meet to discuss this matter, how both Princes should compare for the sake of the nomination, so that peace and unity remain, and that the bishopric be properly appointed, we have only considered writing to E. G. and honorary feasts as well. 

First of all, we ask our Savior Jesus Christ to be in your council, as he said, "Where two or three come together in my name, | will be with them. Now E. G. and E. are sent together in God's name, that is, by command. 


of the supremacy, for the sake of peace and to promote God's glory, therefore we should reasonably ask that our Savior Jesus Christ may rule your hearts with His Holy Spirit and incline you to good counsel. 

And even though we do not doubt that E. G. and E. are themselves inclined, with great earnestness and diligence, to maintain the unity of both princes and peace, and to promote proper church services, we have not wished to restrain E. G. and E. from what we have written to both princes, and hereby send E. G. and E. the copy of the aforementioned document, with a request that they read and listen to it. 

And further, we ask that G. and E. work on the Christian way on both sides, that both princes unanimously agree to nominate such a bishop, who, due to his age and intellect, is fit for the episcopal office, as such is often commanded in God's Word. 

Your. Your Grace and Honorable Feasts know themselves, as the wise and godly, that first of all the foundation of bishoprics, chapters and monasteries are not meant for splendor or idleness, but that they should be a special adornment and comfort of the country, and should serve for the existing, eternal preservation of Christian doctrine, religion, discipline and good arts, namely, That for and for there were many learned, understanding, practiced men, from whom the lordship, knighthood and cities could find good counsel in Christian and many other matters, item, that reported bishops and chapters had an attention to the doctrine and ceremonies in the churches of the whole country, held the marriage courts and practiced good discipline and good manners. 

If the bishopric of Camin were now in such good reformation and order, it is public that this bishopric would be a beautiful jewel of all the lands around, and would be comforting and a joy to the noble princes and the knighthood, so that God would be pleased with such order and would give his grace and rich reward, as he says: "Whoever honors me, | will also bring him to honor; and whoever despises me, | will also make him despised." 

Now, however, E. G. and E. see how the diocese unfortunately now much year like a devastated 


2990 


garden. The bishop left his own churches without pastors, much less visited them in the country; he did not hold a consistory of marriage courts, and, in sum, did nothing that belonged to the episcopal office. 

Because this neglect, which has happened until now, has brought much damage, and if a reasonable, diligent, serious bishop were not elected, the sins, God's contempt and punishments would become greater, every reasonable person can remember for himself what he is obliged to advise in this case. Since God has graciously arranged things in sucha way that the bishopric can be brought into improvement, to the benefit of all princes in Pomerania, and on both sides the harm and benefit, God's prohibition and commandment are so publicly before our eyes that we do not respect that there is anyone in your council who wants to advise against our concerns, or thinks of doing so, or practices against them. 

For this reason we have written more briefly to remind you only of Paul's speech, which spoke especially of the election of bishops and church servants: Let no one be guilty of the sins of others. Whoever prevents the good appointment of the bishopric is guilty of all the neglect and devastation that will follow from a bad appointment; and if there were strife between the dukes, which God would graciously prevent, these would be the first and foremost beginners and causes of the misery, who now give or strengthen this advice that a bishop should not be nominated whose age and mind are fit for the office. Consider the descendants. Although the noble princes themselves now take care of the doctrine and receive the visitation and many church matters from their chamber, it is to be feared that the descendants will not be so burdened. If the bishopric had become desolate in the meantime, and consistory and other necessities had not been established in it, a miserable barbarism would follow. And although we respect E. G. and E. all of virtue for not coveting church property, yet we cannot refrain from reminding E. G. and E. that they want to consider that it is not right to use such property, which belongs to

The church is a place of worship, a place of worship, and a place of worship for the people of the world, and a place of worship for the people of the world, and a place of worship for the people of the world, and a place of worship for the people of the world. 

Thus, G. and E. know that in the government all kinds of goods are needed, which is why God has decreed among His people that every person over twenty years must give as much every year for the preservation of the Tabernacle or Temple as a place of Rhenish Florence, which amounted to several tons of gold every year. And the prophet Haggaeus says: "That is why there is such a fear that one does not give to the temple what one owes to it. Therefore, the G.D. and the G.E. will faithfully advise that the church property be used for God's honor, the preservation of right religion, the marriage courts and good discipline and studies, and not be spent and scattered in vain. 

This Christian reminder of ours, which is meant faithfully and to no one's detriment or burden, E. G. and E. want to graciously and kindly accept from us, as we do not doubt, E. G. and E., as lovers of virtue, will not let them dislike this writing of ours, and will themselves faithfully direct this matter in Christian ways, which God will reward. And E. G. and E.' we are willing to serve. Date Wittenberg, on the 30th day of May, 1544.

Our greetings and very gracious will before. Respectable, worthy, esteemed, dear special | Shortly after each other, we have received two letters from your A. W., the first of which was a petition on behalf of a young journeyman that we would like to do him gracious help and tax, the other, concerning a Doctor Conrad, also how it should have happened to you how we should have undertaken feud and war against some of our neighbors by instigating and moving the Burgundians, with further contents, 2) both of their property graciously exempted and understood, whereupon we do not want your A.

1) The copy of this letter in the Weimar Archives has in any case incorrectly: 1541; for Luther's complaint about Conrad Peutinger (No. 3106), the correct dating of which has been certified to me by the Imperial Archivist Nordstrom in Stockholm, is dated April 12, 1544; consequently, this letter also belongs to the year 1544. (Burkhardt.) 

2) In any case, the letter had a postscript that has been lost (Burkhardt). 





Concerning the intercession (vorbiet) of the young journeyman, we are at all times obliged on account of your request, also that we can consider it necessary without that for the best of our realms, because we have to remember by divine grace, also know that God Almighty has for this reason chosen (provided for) us for royal government of these our realms and has mentioned that we should maintain there the holy Christian religion, also laudable police, which none without the help and assistance of learned 3) people may long endure, shall be maintained, protected, administered and continued, for which reason we are quite unburdened, indeed most graciously inclined, 4) so that we may now, also hereafter, have ours, 5) people in our realms, to do gracious help and taxation to the pious, diligent fellows, who honestly hold themselves of our 6) nation there with you at Wittenberg, have also recommended it to our councilors without delay. But what concerns the Doctvrem Conrad, whom we use as our War Counselor and Cancellarium, who has served us from the time of his service like an honorable and Christ- loving man, that we may graciously bear witness to in truth; But as far as his supposed former wife is concerned, we are not aware of anything else, except that on several occasions, not without justifiable and legitimate complaints, he has excused himself by telling us that he had meant her very badly and unfaithfully because of her lewd and unseemly life, and where it was possible for him to live with her without disgrace, he would very much like to be separated from her; However, dear Doctor, since we, and every true Christian lover, should regard every man's rightful excuse as just and should not condemn or judge anyone in his justified matters. Accordingly, we hereby graciously request you not to be induced to write anything before you have heard this Christian apology of our Council and Chancellor. 7) However, we do not want you to be induced to write anything. But what Ew. A. W., recently writing to our servant Balthasarn Funcken, reported, as that we are to be described and stated something in the German nation, as [as] if we had taken up feud by a Burgundian head against the

K. It is far too inhospitable, indeed, violent and unjust, for us to allow the introduction and movement of our dignity to trademarks by our detractors, who otherwise, without cause, solely out of an envious mind and heart, seek and practice our undeserving with unsaved effort. For although we may demand that which is owed and obligated to us and our rich for good (vor gut) in addition to all equity (gepilligkeit), and cannot at any time yield to the unpleasant (vnliderliche) disadvantage to us and ours, we want to consider [that] on account of this we can with justification neither be proclaimed (nor) Burgundian or French, shouted at or called upon, because of this, that by reason of our royal office it is due to us 1) to postulate what our kingdoms 2) are entitled to postulate, and not 3) to yield to any one (idern) all the way (as has ever happened, about which our kingdoms 2) have been oppressed not a little, less than rightly) 4) that we may well promote the same with good Christian equity.

About the settlement of a dispute between the Diaconus Spenleins and a certain Simon. 


Handwritten in Cod. chart. Goth. Printed in Innocent News 1708, p. 657; in Strobel-Ranner, p. 336 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 665 f. 

To the most reverend Father in Christ, Magister Georg Spenlein, the extremely faithful pastor in the church at Arnstadt, his very dear brother. 

Grace and peace in Christ! | was pleased to hear the other day, my dear Georg Spenlein, pastor and brother, that the abominable discord in your parish had been settled. And although the matter would not have been worthy of Satan's causing such a great stirring of the hearts for its sake, | nevertheless approved of Doctor Mérlin's opinion that he commanded his cause to God for the sake of the good of peace, which is higher than all our but stained and sullied righteousnesses before God. But behold! Satan is still hidden in his nest: since he does not like this peace, he blows up a new spark, over the true and the false reconciliation. Therefore | beseech thee, that, after thy pastoral office, thou call to thee that one, whoever he may be, Simon, and thy deacon, and tell them in gentle words, beseeching them for Christ's sake, that they should endeavor to bring to peace the one who has been made by the

Mr. Friedrich 1) to maintain the peace that has been established. And because | see that the one wants to evade this, that he asks the other for forgiveness with words that are put into a certain form, then you as pastor may take the things of both to you in your name, or also in my name, and order them that Simon should refrain from bringing up new complaints, but the Diaconus should refrain from pressing for the [form of] reconciliation. For if he thus continues to enforce justice in the very strongest terms (ad vivam cutem), there will never be peace. "Whoever wants to be a Christian must in such a case also forgive himself his beautiful justice, for the sake of peace, And let God also be commanded to judge something," and give room not only to grace, but also to wrath. "For without our righteousness we can be saved, but without peace we cannot be Christians," because Christ is peace. Therefore, having received the handshake of both, you will proclaim: |, your pastor, quell and extinguish all your adversities between you, after you have also given them into my hand, and may you be at peace in the name of the Lord, Amen. 

If now one or the other wanted to boast afterwards in a childish or feminine way: "Yes, | am right all the same, he had to beg me off, the priest must take it to himself," you must remember him diligently; this one is certainly one of the seeds of discord, an untamed boaster of his righteousness. Therefore let his righteousness be condemned with him, since he does not value the common peace a hair's breadth against the glorious victory of his righteousness. For because of this his righteousness is sevenfold iniquity, and his victory accursed for ever, who tramples under foot Christ our peace. "But let them say, Yea, dear reverend, if | be right or wrong, | will let it fall to the service of peace. If it is right, it is God's command; if itis wrong, | am sorry, for | would rather not be a child of peace, nor of my own righteousness; for let it be so, because it is 


1) Myconius, as visitator. 


but not the doctrine 2c. For what cannot be settled without disturbing the peace, let it be wound into a ball 2) until God Himself once unwinds it." For Satan entangles us. "If all this does not help in the devil's mind, one must resort to divorce. But this is not to be advised to those at Arnstadt, for they would do too much if the preachers, whose doctrine and life are blameless, were to sit in such danger that they would leap up and jump for the sake of every word; and if there should not be so much love for peace with them that they could not hear a word from their pastors, these will only be bad Christians, and just those who, for the sake of their honor (filth, | say), afflict and mislead the whole church, which they can never bring back: Their honor has become an eternal disgrace in hell. It seems that some of them are heady enough." 

But you admonish them, as | have said, that after they have laid down their grievances and _ their righteousnesses, in such danger for peace, they keep the peace that has been made. Otherwise there will be no end to the strife, and Satan will triumph against Christ. Woe to him through whom this trouble comes. For as itis truly said, A weary head is a ready bath for the devil; so also, The love of one's own righteousness is a perfect kingdom for the devil. May the Lord Jesus help you with His Holy Spirit, so that you may cast out this stubborn and headstrong Satan, amen. Fare well in the Lord. Tuesday after Viti [June 17] 1544.

Grace and peace! Carlowitz does nothing new, as you write, my dear Anton, but the obdurate man does what he deserves and is worthy of. Let it go as it goes.

Since you request that | write about church discipline, | think that the Lord will perhaps arrange this through someone else. lam completely and utterly exhausted, and others will do better.

May the Lord increase his spirit in us, amen. 

What else should you do with those who postpone the reception of the sacrament until the last breath, than to publicly admonish them to be careful and fearful of such a danger? then, that you threaten that if someone continues to postpone it until the senses and reason have disappeared, the sacrament cannot be given to them, certainly no more than to a sow or a dog. For such people cannot be dealt with from the bosom, nor can it be investigated what they believe or what they deal with; therefore they cannot be capable of the Sacrament, and it is offered to them in vain. Let their blood be on their head, who throughout their life, while they are healthy, despise Word and Sacrament, by which they become more and more unskilled in the same day by day, so that they are deservedly deprived of the Sacraments by their own fault at the end of life. Therefore, while they are alive, while they are well, while they can hear and respond, and confess sins and faith loudly and clearly, may they be careful to become accustomed to the use of the Word and Sacrament. But if not, they may also in the end, when reason and

Intercession for the son-in-law of his uncle Veit Luther, the miner Andreas Gutjahr from Ziegelroda near Querfurt, who was under investigation as a counterfeiter.

The original is in the archives at Weimar, Reg. U, p. 196. VI. no. 25. 5. Printed by Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 74. 


My dear Doctor! One more thing, for the sake of a good friend. There sits one, with name Andres Gutjahr, to Eisleben, as if he should have wrongly mint on my most gracious lord blow 2c. Now my friends are running at me, because he has a wife who is a sibling with me, namely her father, Veit Luder, and my father, Hans Luder, have been right brothers. 

Now | do not want to ask any further, because as far as the mild law can help his cause, that one may lend him a good word. Otherwise, if the matter is so evil that Epiikia cannot help him, | do not want to have the name that my most gracious lord should, for the sake of my request, leave unpunished what the law punishes, since we preach and cry out daily that there is neither regiment nor punishment. And everyone does what he wants, as there are many examples here in Wittenberg. | wish that princes and lords could also be punished when they strike false coin. Otherwise, stealing is so intemperate that | cannot understand how it will be possible in a short time for a poor householder to acquire bread. 


1) This document is an inserted note to a letter of Luther to Brick, without date (perhaps to the previous letter); the year results from the fact that Gutjahr was brought from Ziegelroda to Eisleben in 1544 and was interrogated there. 





It steals servant, maid, neighbor, craft, officials, usurers, merchants: still all gallows are free and celebrate that | in such a case of the coin theft (although with the merchants now a right) also myself will not forbid. | am writing this so that | can tell my friends that | have written.

Grace and peace in the Lord! | have, my bishop venerable in Christ, neither seen nor read the Cologne Reformation, although | hear that it is praised. | have asked M. Philippus, who says that it is such, that the right understanding and custom of the Word and the Sacraments are taught in all churches, with the removal of all superstition. But the monasteries and convents are to remain undisturbed as they are now. If this were to be the case, it would be tolerable until God would give something else. For this robbery, or rather the rapacity of the princes, the nobles and the authorities, is hateful and detestable, and by their example will bring great ruin, or even the devastation of the parishes and schools. "They want it all, and that too, what the princes have." And there comes the end 2c. Orally and in short more. For the prince writes

We have received the gifts you sent me and the children, but | ask you, if you have anything left, to give it to your sister children (nepotibus) and to their mother, the very good woman whom | cannot remember without sighing because of her husband's misfortune.

Now itis true that we theologians have taught up to now, and still teach, that such disposed monastic estates are to be set aside for the use of the churches and poor people primarily and above all things; for this is just, also divine, as you yourselves also confess in your casu. But to which persons this is due or should be due, we theologians have nothing to do with, because we are not commanded to do so, nor can we know the occasion, but this must be judged by the lawyers, since part is interrogated against part. What the lawyers will say or have said here, we will leave at that; for such a thing concerns worldly matters, which the lawyers are commanded to do, and our theology teaches to uphold worldly law, to protect the pious and to punish the wicked. For this reason, E. W. may ask the jurists about this and the like.

Respectable, highly learned gentleman, dear father! | like the bishop's articles, especially the one about the Lord's Supper, because there is power in it, and | am sending them again herewith. | am pleased in the book that they do not use my name, as the Bishop of Zeitz 1) would like in good opinion; for he frightens the people in the beginning, and it is better that [it] goes out without all names in the name of the Bishop of Cologne. However, moved by the articles, | quickly fell into the book, and from the sacrament, because there the shoe presses me hard, and find that [it] pleases me nothing everywhere. For a long time, there is a lot of talk about the benefit, fruit and honor of the sacrament, but it mumbles about the substance, so that one should not hear what he thinks of it, in all measure, as the enthusiasts do, and as the bishop indicates, does not say a word against the enthusiasts, in which it is nevertheless necessary to act; the other would be found with less effort and talk. But nowhere does it appear whether the true body and blood were received orally, nor does it report anything about it, since it tells of the Anabaptists' error, even though the Anabaptists have as many more evil articles as the Anabaptists. All in all, the book is not only helpful to the enthusiasts, but also comforting, much more for their doctrine than for ours. That is why | am tired of it and am exceedingly unenthusiastic about it. If |am to read it in its entirety, M. G. Herr must give me room to do so until my unwillingness subsides; otherwise | may not look at it well. And even without that, as the bishop shows, everything and everything is too laughed at and too much laundry, that | can feel the mouth, the bncer, here. Another time, when | come to you, further.

To the honorable, wise and noble, mayors and council of the city of Mulhouse, our favorable lords and friends. 

God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, before. Honorable, wise, noble, favorable lords and friends! We have received your letter, in which you are diligently seeking a capable man to govern the church in your city, and we can well remember that the worthy and well-learned Mr. Justus Menius recently conversed with us here, since we also considered all kinds of dangers of your churches, especially in this divided princely government, and that nowadays people all over the world, high and low, are inclined to be wild and completely inactive. 

Therefore, we first ask God, the eternal Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, to govern and preserve your church and city, to give you good counsel and peace, and to provide the churches with Christian, moral, peaceful teachers and to avert all troubles, If God gives you a Christian, learned, moral pastor in Mr. Menii's place, it is useful for peace and Christian government that the same always remain for and for superattendents, and that obnoxious superattendents are not placed in your church. 

Now Sebastian Boetius, of whom you wrote, has been known to us for many years. Therefore, because we know that he is God-fearing, well-learned, and understands the pure Christian doctrine, and that he is a good man.

To the in Christ highly venerable brother, Mr. Johann Lang, Doctor of Theology, the faithful and exceedingly loud bishop and pastor of the church at Erfurt. 

Mercy and peace! About the case you reported to me, my dear Lang, we judge here thus: although the girl would have vowed without the condition of her father's consent simply and unreservedly, her vow would still be invalid and nothing. Thus | have the son of Magister Philippbus, who had been seduced into binding himself to a girl by a terrifying oath 





We have absolved Duke Ernst of Bramkschweig, 1) who, in addition to swearing oaths, had written the betrothal with his own blood, from our court, because we consider it a kind of kidnapping and theft from God that sons and daughters are turned away from their families by these artifices, secretly torn from their parents and their power; Yes, as much as our jurists are stubborn in the matter of Caspar Beyer 2), the prince has nevertheless confirmed my judgment by public recognition. Therefore, they grumble and rage against me so that they almost burst. In general, we must resist this evil because of the reverence to be observed against the commandments of God, and not admit that the papists can be judges in a matter, be it spiritual or eavesdropping, because they have deposed themselves from the office of governing the church, since they profess and show themselves to be enemies of the Word and the church. And the Antichrist did not have the power to give this law 27, 9, 2: Sufficiat de clandestinis etc.. since it is a law that came from Satan himself, with similar laws, against the fourth commandment, against civil rights and those of nature, and against the examples of the law of Moses. Therefore, there is no right, nor law, nor judgment, nor prestige, nor judge in this matter with the jurists, and with your authorities only the will is required, and with you pastors the rejection against the ravings of Antichrist and his. And you cannot bless such pledges either, if you do not want to make yourselves partakers of other people's sins and confirm the abominations of the pope. So we do, and the prince approves. | wish to finish my book 3) for printing (editum) as soon as possible, which | have under my hands. Fare well in the Lord.

Grace and peace! There has come to our academy this Hungarian guest, Bartholomew Georgiewitz, a foreigner from Jerusalem, who tells that he was captured by Turks in the battle in which King Louis perished, and after that he was in Constantinople for seven years and then in Asia for six years in slavery. He reports in such a knowledgeable manner the names of the places and the nature of the regions, and the customs of both the Turkish people and the Armenians and Greeks, and tells such true things in credible stories that we believe he is an honorable man and stays in foreign countries for honest reasons. It was very pleasant to us that he said that in Armenia the Church of Christ and the study of Christian doctrine are still flourishing. Therefore, we entrust this guest to the protection of good people everywhere, who know that services to guests are both pleasing to God and especially fitting for the nature of men, and that they should also remind ourselves of our misery (exilio). For we come as guests into this world, and are received by many tribulations. But we strive for the fatherland and a quiet abode and for contact with Christ. However, God exceedingly graciously mitigates the many miseries of our lives as guests, if we are moved by mercy toward the guests. Given at Wittenberg, the 11th day of August, Anno 1544.

G. graciously look upon him and show him favor. He seems to be very poorly provided for in his parish, so that he cannot remain there unless support is provided for him and he is advised. He thinks that he (as they say) got off the horse onto the donkey, so he now suffers from lack with his wife and seven children. E. F. G. will (as | do not doubt) deal with him according to the good spirit of God, when the work of the visitation will have begun. For he tells me how several other parishes have been devastated and abandoned, so that a speedy restoration is very necessary. For this work | ask E. F. G. for many and great graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, so that this visitation may be fruitful for the glory of God and the salvation of many souls, amen. E. F. G. be well in Christ.

At the same time, | also accuse you with him that you ordered to set out the costs of the whole journey, so that | did not spend a penny at all. Because for this reason you did not come to the episcopal riches, that it was due to you and that it was proper for you to be a spendthrift. And as if this were not enough, you loaded me with a silver jug and a spoon, without my knowledge, just as you did with a penny.

Therefore, Count Albrecht is not to be allowed to declare anything he wants to be sedition, according to his desires and in his wrathfulness. Therefore, the count sinned more against Libius by this offense than Libius did against the count, and the count is obliged to recant and to ask Libius for forgiveness if he wants to be a Christian.

Ordination for Johann Reibitz. 

Printed in the Fortgesetzten Sammlung 1729, p. 533 and in Seidemann, Lutherbriefe, p. 71 f. 

We, pastor and preacher of the church at Wittenberg, after witnessing this writing, Johannes Reibitz, confess that he is appointed pastor (Parumer) at Kohlenberg, and is of honest, Christian morals, and we requested to interrogate him and publicly 1) The name of the ordinand is written in different ways in this certificate: "Reybetz, Reybytz, Reywytz and Reywitz". The place where he is called is called in the text "Kohlenberg", in the inscription in the continued collection: "Collenberg". But because 


there is not supposed to be such a place near Halle, Seidemann assumes: "Kollenbei". 


has a good understanding of the pure Christian doctrine of the Gospel. He has also agreed to carry out his ministry diligently and to remain steadfast in the Christian doctrine of the gospel, as it is known and taught in our church by God's grace in harmony with the true Catholic church of Christ. Therefore, John Reibitz is publicly ordained here according to the command of divine Scripture in the church, and we order him to preach the holy gospel and to administer the holy sacraments, as he is called, and we ask from the bottom of our hearts that the eternal God, Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, will give his church capable teachers, as he ordered us to ask and graciously promised to give. And so may this John Reibitz also be given his grace and Holy Spirit, so that he may serve the Savior Christ and the church to honor and glory. We also admonish John Reibitz and his church to faithfully plant the purity of Christian doctrine, to preserve it for all time, and to inherit it and pass it on ito their descendants. For this service the eternal God demands primarily of all men, as Christ says John 15:8: "That my Father may be honored, if ye bear much fruit, and become my disciples." And where one receives this light, there remains the church; with this church God is and wants to give eternal life and in all kinds of sorrow and anguish of this transient life help and save those who call upon him. For there he will be and hear, where the right teaching of the gospel is, as Christ also says John 15:7: "If ye abide in me, and if my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."

Wittenberg. Ordination certificate for Christoph Longolius. 


From the collection of Joh. Gottfried Olearius at Arnstadt in Schitze, Vol. |, p. 326 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 687. 

Christoph Longolius has brought letters to us, which testify that he has honorable and godly manners and is called to lead the church in Lobechin. Since we have been asked to ordain him publicly after we have investigated his scholarship, we have carefully interrogated him and perceived that he correctly holds the summa of Christian godliness and accepts the pure last of the gospel, which our church confesses in one spirit and with one voice with the general church of Christ, and has an abhorrence of fanatical opinions, which are condemned by the judgment of the general church. This Christoph also promises constancy in doctrine and faithfulness and diligence in office. Therefore, according to apostolic doctrine, he is commanded by public ordination to teach the Gospel and to administer the sacraments instituted by Christ according to his profession. And since it is written of the Son of God: "He ascended on high, and gave gifts to men...", he is the Son of God.

For God requires that He be honored primarily through this service, as Christ says [John 15:8]: "In this My Father is honored, that you bear much fruit, and become My disciples.” And if this light is kept, the Church abides, and GOD will be in it, will give eternal life to those who call upon Him, and will help in the tribulations of men. For there is and there God hears, where His Gospel resounds rightly, as it is written John 15:7: "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done for you."

To the respectable man, Mr. Joachim M6rlin, Doctor of Theology, the faithful bishop of the church at Géttingen, his brother who is exceedingly dear to the Lord. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! | wonder how this can be necessary for you to ask for advice, my dear doctor, as if you were unaware of what you should preach. Do you not have the Law and the Gospel? According to these, the word of God must be divided correctly, so that you can strike and heal, kill and make alive. Perhaps you hope in vain that all will hear and love the word, or you insist on the law without the gospel, so that they think they hear you, not God, or that they are forced by you. It is enough for you if the fourth part of the land receives the seed, unless you want to be better than Christ or Elijah, who was satisfied with seven thousand. For the sake of the meek, be gentle; let the hard ones, when you speak the law, quarrel with God, and remember that you have administered your ministry; they may read the Scriptures themselves if they do not believe you. The time is getting worse every day, and they will turn away from the truth. | have nothing else to write, you yourself know the Scriptures. Be well in the Lord and pray for us.

No. 3148. Wittenberg. October 4, 1544. To the city council of Amberg, together with Melanchthon. 


When after the accession of Ludwig V, Elector of the Palatinate, in 1544 the Reformation got the upper hand, and the Protestant service was even moved to the main church of St. Martin in Amberg, the city council of this city sent a letter through an envoy to Luther and asked him for a preacher. He promised them the previous, popular Andreas Higel (cf. No. 2472 and 2482) and another, also a school teacher. 


To the honorable, wise and fair Herreu, mayors and council of the city of Amberg, our favorable lords and friends. 


God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Savior before. Honorable, wise, noble, favorable lords and friends! We have received your wisdom, Christian writing, and are pleased that God has given you this grace, that you yourselves desire to praise Him with right knowledge of His Gospel, right invocation, and obedience commanded by Him, and that your praiseworthy rule is not unfit for such improvement of the Church, we also ask from the bottom of our hearts that our Savior Jesus Christ may enlighten your hearts with His Holy Spirit, govern them, and strengthen them for the improvement of the Churches to God's praise and your blessedness. And after we have spoken to Magistro Andrea Hiigel and Magistro Johanne of Munich 1) on your writing, they have offered themselves good-willingly and Christianly to serve your church according to the vocation; And Magister Andreas would not have been disinclined to move to you now and as soon as possible, but he has this opportunity, that in the cold time it is not possible for him to make such a long journey with the young children, but he asks to come to you at Easter, or in case of need still this winter, although his wife and children would have to remain here until after winter, as your envoy will further report. Although we would like your church to be well cared for, we hope that, since we have only heard that a Christian preacher is now with you, you will have patience for this delay, as we ask; and what Master Johannes has thought of the degree 2) and of his future, you will hear from his letter. We have also spoken with a gentle, sedentary, well-respected man, Magistro Matthao Michaele of Torgatt, for the sake of the school, who has offered to travel to you without risk in four weeks. And where, for the welfare of your church

Concerns about the transfer of the Diet from Worms to Augsburg. 


The rumor had spread that the emperor would move the imperial diet, which had been announced for Worms, to Augsburg. The council of Augsburg feared that the Imperial Diet would curtail religious freedom and therefore turned to the Elector of Saxony with the request that he should prevent the Imperial Diet from being moved there. The Elector did not agree, but on October 28 he sent this concern with a letter to the Augsburg council. 


From the Weimar Archives, Reg. H 571-574, No. 186, printed by Burkhardt, p. 450. It is by Bugenhagen's hand, but without signature. 

The Psalm says, "Command GOtte thy way, and he shall perform it." We see that we cannot lead this great cause, the preservation of right pure doctrine, with human prudence alone. Therefore, do as much as is possible at any time by right divine means, and do not think that it is possible to prevent all future dangers.-And although we also ask and call upon our Savior Jesus Christ for peace, it is nevertheless to be feared that our antagonism will now persist so vehemently with His Majesty that much _ swifter attempts will be made to destroy or weaken or break up our churches. - Nevertheless, we do not want to advise that one should 


| do not believe that | will use improper means of my own accord to prevent the Diet than with armaments, war or indignation, but [it is] better that we wait and see how God Himself will send and guide us in time. Whoever wants to stay, let him stay; whoever does not want to stay, we cannot keep. - And first of all it is true that if the city of M. [Augsburg] could occur with due cause that the Diet would not be held there, that would be very good. Therefore, this should first be attempted, and the Emperor should be reminded of the theuration and such inconvenience, and it should also be indicated that His Majesty knows how it has a form there for the sake of religion, and if a change were to be made in it, all sorts of things would have to be taken care of. - If this does not help, however, and the King persists in his opinion that the Diet should be held in N., then this may be allowed to happen, and the gates cannot be closed to him as the Lord. - From this it will follow that he wants to have a church there, will perhaps also bring the canons there again and order them to hold their usual ceremonies, and it would also be necessary to have patience if the king were to take a church and hold his ceremonies there with his people, as he did in Nuremberg at the castle. For we cannot and should not force him to hold our ceremonies. - If, however, he should command us to hold still with the present right doctrine and sermon and Christian ceremonies, the city of Nuremberg, together with the other estates that will be there, shall petition Imperial Maj. Maj. and be clearly heard that they will keep their present ecclesiastical order and not let it fall, and even if the Imperial Diet is disrupted because of this, there is no other way to proceed in this case. - If, however, Imperial Maj. Maj. alone seizes and restores the cathedral chapter without this search, and wants to reinstate the Canonicos, the Council shall, on the other hand, petition Imperial Maj. Maj. for this, with notice of ecclesiastical and secular grievances, so that they [the canons] may cause the city manifold disturbances before this time, and that they do not know and do not want to protect them in the future. - If the King is not satisfied with this, the City Council may be patient and await the end of the Imperial Diet, which is to be held in the next few days.

If the patient is appointed to the doctorate, there is no disputation anywhere, as E. C. F. G. do. But now D.

To Mr. Christoph Piscator, Magister, the extremely 

faithful servant of the word at Jiiterbock. 

Grace and peace! | have received your questions, my dear Christoph, and although | have neither sufficient leisure nor health to answer everyone's letters, | will answer you very briefly. 

To the first. You can proclaim from the pulpit to the obstinate and the despisers of the sacrament that they are not to be considered Christians and are to be buried outside the churchyard, especially those who turn to the monks out of defiance and allow themselves to be communicated. But see from where you may get the power to carry this out, whether the authorities will assist you with the congregation. 

Secondly. If you can prevent alms from being given to hostile monks and to those who disturb the church and the preaching ministry, you will do well. 

To the third. It is more than too much that the bishops have suffered up to now, that women and virgins have gone to church as preened and garlanded as if they were going to a theater. It is a very obvious abuse against Paul and Peter. But the habit is very hard (violenta). Therefore, when they partake of the sacrament, the abuse is to be forbidden to them absolutely, so that they may not be unequal to our and other churches. For it is a sign of frivolity, and of those who do not esteem the sacrament any more highly than the bread on the common table. 

To the fourth. As much as possible, you must resist the postponement of baptism.

so that this custom does not finally set an example to abstain from them forever. 

Thus, in Italy, in many cities, a large part of the people remain unbaptized throughout life, since they are not baptized in childhood; when they grow up, they despise everything and die as people who do not believe in God (xxxxx). This is how the pope Clement died without baptism; this looks like rebaptism. 1) Fare well in the Lord. Thursday after Martinmas [Nov. 13] 1544.

Information on the status of the engagement of Caspar Beyer. For an understanding of this letter, Burkhardt notes: "that Caspar Beyer had become engaged to Sybilla Beyer, who, however, had withdrawn, since she had made the claim that Beyer had already been engaged to Margaretha Moschwitz. Beyer claimed that his betrothal to Sybilla had occurred with the foreknowledge of her father." This legal transaction was pending since Pentecost 1543, as we can see from No. 3085, and was only terminated towards the end of January 1545, when Beyer was absolved from Moschwitz (see Luther's letter to Casp. Beyer of Jan. 27, 1546).

Now that you have compared and compiled the following reminder of such counsel on the basis of Doctor Briick's reports, as well as that of our esteemed councilor and dear friend, Magister Frantzen, 2) we graciously request that you send it to us, as soon as possible, for our own hands.

To the highly venerable man, Mr. Friedrich Mecum, the faithful and fair bishop of the church at Gotha and the neighboring churches, his brother who is extremely dear to your Lord. 

Grace and peace! | write little, my dear Frederick, 

so [bad] is my condition. It pleases me that this matter does not trouble the priest whom you advised, and he can be calm in his conscience that he buried the woman who vowed herself, when otherwise she killed herself. | know many similar examples, but in these | use to judge in such a way that such people have been killed par excellence and directly by the devil himself, as a wanderer is killed by a robber. Since it is known and there are certain signs that it is not possible in a natural way that such people could kill themselves [in such a way], since a rope or a belt or (as your example teaches here) a garment (pep/um) without a knot, which hangs down and is limp, could not kill a fly: so | consider that one must believe that such people are mocked by the devil himself, so that they seem to intend something quite different for themselves, namely praying or the like. And yet the devil kills in such a way. But the authorities do right, in order to frighten, that they also punish them with the usual severity, so that Satan (especially when it has become known) does not creep in under such a comfort. And the world deserves it, and it is time that it be admonished, since it is epicuric (epicurissat), and thinks that the devil is nothing. | would like to write to you in more detail about these judgments and examples of God even to His own. | remember reading in secular books that in a certain city the virgins, as if they had conspired, killed themselves one after the other by hanging. Since the authorities were frightened because they could not find a remedy, one of them finally advised that the next one who had hanged herself should be dragged naked through the streets (with her shame exposed) with one foot tied to a horse. Since all were deterred by this spectacle, this monstrosity of Satan ceased. But what is

To Anton Lauterbach, pastor in Pirna. 


Ueber Lauterbach's Anfechtungen und die von ihm verlangte Schrift von der Kirchenzucht; von Luther's schriftstellerischen Arbeiten. 


Manuscript in Aurifaber, vol. Ill, pp. 436 and 442. From the Kraft Collection at Husum in Schitze, vol. |, p. 328 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 700. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 1531. 


Grace and peace in the Lord, who strengthens and sustains you by the spirit of his strength. My dear Anton! | like to believe that Satan is burdensome to you, since you bless and worship the seed of the woman, whom he, the serpent with his seed, hates and curses. Therefore, it is not you whom the seed of the serpent pursues, the bishops and the courtiers of Dresden, but it pursues the seed of the woman, whose heel 1) you are with the church. Therefore, you must necessarily feel the bite of the serpent and its enmity, as we all do and the whole church. But we have the hope that as long as we remain the heel of Christ, the head of the same will also be trodden down by us with its teeth, as it has been trodden down daily since the beginning of the world, will always be trodden down, and will be trodden down until the end, amen. 


More often you urge the book of ecclesiastical discipline, but you do not write from where leisure and health should come to me, since | am old, exhausted and sluggish. | am in fact overwhelmed with the writing of letters without end. | have promised the younger princes a sermon on drunkenness, others, including myself, a book on secret betrothals, others against the sacramentaries; others desire that | should leave everything pending and write a summarium and a continuous explanation (glossam) about the entire

Bible. So one thing hinders the other, so that | cannot finish anything. And yet | thought that I, as a retired man, should be given leisure so that | could live and sleep in peace and quiet, but | am forced to live very restlessly. However, | will do what | can; what | cannot do, | will leave undone. | thank you for your goodwill towards me. Be well in the Lord and pray for us as we do for you. | am sorry to hear that Daniel [Cresser] is thinking of leaving the church in Dresden. May the Lord do what is good in His eyes. Give my best regards to your relatives. December 2, 1544.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


Luther shall, in order to avoid inequality of judgments in matrimonial matters, make a reservation in which it is expressly stated that an engagement made without the knowledge and will of the parents is void, and that this is not changed by silence or subsequent consent. The same applies to marriages with relatives in the fourth degree. - Luther's answer came on January 18, 1545. 


December 3, 1544. 


From Reg. D, fol. 49. 42° , in the Weimar Archives, printed by Burkhardt, p. 454. 


After we have ordered you in various times in the matter to prosecute the highborn prince, Mr. Ernsten, Duke of Brunswick, our friendly dear grandfathers, on the one hand and Ernsten von _ Starschedel (Dorstedel) on the other hand on account of his daughter, as if his love should have promised her a marriage, to proceed legally on both parties' submissions, but that finally it would not be recognized, because the verdict would be sent to us beforehand, and our doubts would also be heard therein, so the matter has been presented to us, as you would finally have been thought of to recognize in the matter 2). And even though we put up with sucha verdict, and that it is recognized in this way, we still take care, because the 


2) This matter had been rightfully pending since April 1541 (cf. No. 2781), but will probably have come to a conclusion only in January 1545, after the jurists of the Consistory and the Court Court had submitted to Luther's will (cf. the letter of January 18, 1545). 


3040 


If the marriage should have taken place some time earlier than the contradiction of our dear grandson, Duke Philips of Brunswick, as the father of our Lord, then the party will not refrain from continuing on your instructions, 1) and nevertheless, as before, want to insist on his love to open their conscience, as if S. L. should have had knowledge of it and kept silent and thus silently consented to it, as perhaps such 2) silence of the parents for a granting of such cases. L. should rather have known about it and kept silent, and silently consented to it, as perhaps the imperial laws may consider such 2) silence of the parents to be a permission and consent in such cases. Because we have then learned from your, D. Martinus, which you addressed to us in Caspar Beyer's matters in the winter of next year, and also from other letters of yours, we do not note anything else than that such marriage vows, which are made without the parents’ knowledge and will at the beginning, shall be unbinding 3) and invalid, even after no further contradiction has been made on them, we would rather see you agree that such secret betrothals of children, as they were initially void, should remain void, so that the reason and cause of this judgment would be placed on them, and not only on the contradiction, as for the main subject. For we find that, nevertheless, from time to time repugnant judgments occur about it, which we would like to see brought into a final settlement. We therefore request with special graces, also seriously, that you call the other theologians, also the jurists of our court and our Consistorii deputies to you on our enclosed order and compare with each other unanimously whether such secret engagements, which are made without the knowledge and will of the parents at the beginning, shall be and remain unbinding and invalid, or may be ratified by the subsequent silence of the parents, as we then note the imperial rights, which subsequently allow tacit or express consent to be valid. For we would like to do an explicit transfiguration and transfer by our letter, so that only males in our principality would know and have to judge. And that in such matters very unequal concerns, also judgments, should occur, we have noted partly from the marriage case of Caspar Beyer, partly also from this, namely that in a marriage case in our consistory, since a young

4) From our Consistory, which has already been touched upon, he shall be instructed that the mother should indicate reasons why she does not want to consent to the son's engagement, since we thought that this alone should be a sufficient cause in this case, that the son became engaged without the mother's knowledge and will and made a secret engagement. Therefore, we want you to compare yourselves to this, so that the people's useless gossip and annoyance, which one is supposed to do beforehand, may remain. We do not want to save you from this, and do us a gracious favor. Date Torgau, Wednesday after Andrea [Dec. 3] 1544. 


Note. Since there are also all kinds of inaccuracies in matrimonial matters concerning the kinship below the fourth degree incl., in the same way also the affinity, we want to talk about this among each other, because you have noted before from us that us, both in friendship and affinity, to take marriage below the touched fourth degree inci. in our princedoms and lands, is not convenient, for which we also have honorable and well-founded reasons. And although we do not intend to break up such marriages, since they do not take place above the degrees forbidden by God, we do not want to know or suffer those who marry more closely in our lands, but to have our lands forbidden to them as a punishment and to others as an abomination, for the preservation of some good morals, just as it has happened up to now for some to attend each other in other places, since they want to suffer. But since we find that our ordinance is being contravened, and that now and then the preachers and superintendents are subject to dispense with people contrary to our order, because the degrees are not forbidden by God's law to that extent, we graciously request that you inform us of your concerns as to what the preachers and superintendents should be ordered to do about it. For although they are authorized, 5) after the matter has been decided, to comfort the consciences of the people, that it be done in such a way that it is not done contrary to our order, but that the people be instructed to obey us nevertheless in the visitation order, and to turn away from our lands, for which their dispensation would neither protect nor excuse them: we have no

Luther consoles him because of the tribulations he has to suffer in his ministry and because of the decrease of his strength, 


Handwritten in Aurifaber, Vol. Ill, p. 437. Printed in Schitze, Vol. I, p. 329 and in De Wette, Vol. V, p. 701 f. For an old German translation see No. 3140. 


Grace and peace in the Lord! What | should write to you, my best Cordatus, | do not really know. For good and happy things | would write to you with the greatest pleasure, since you are not the last among my best friends, because | have experienced and know for certain that you have been, always are and will be an exceedingly faithful lover of our doctrine, that is, of the Word, who is the Son of God and of the Virgin, since you have always faithfully and loudly recognized and taught this with us, not without the greatest evil reproach, which is our reward in this world, and hatred, as He says [Luc. 21, 17.] "You will be hated by everyone for my sake," but [Matth. 5, 12.] "be joyful and confident." The same, the Word of the Father, also says [Luc. 6:23.], "Your reward is great in heaven." This fruit, this reward, this glory is enough; indeed, the recompense for our short-lived labor that we do for Him is all-sufficient. What is the world? what is its raging? yes, what is its prince? Certainly a smoke and a bubble of water compared to the Lord who is with us, whom we serve, that is, who works in us. But you can say this better yourself. By the way, | am sorry that you are weak in strength. | pray to the Lord to sustain and strengthen you. | can easily believe that the marrow will not

If you wish it to be in the best way, take it also with your life and health. But let us rejoice in tribulations, and, let it go as it may. Our honor, even yours, lies in this, that we let the sun of our doctrine rise without clouds to the ungodly and ungrateful world, according to the example of our Father, who lets this sun of his rise over good and evil. And since the sun also of our doctrine is his, what wonder is there if they hate the domestics? [Matth. 10, 25.] "Oh we live in the devil's kingdom", outwardly, "therefore we shall neither see nor hear any good thing", outwardly, but we live in the kingdom of Christ, inwardly, where we see the riches of the glory and grace of God. "And is called": "Reign in the midst of your enemies." It is a kingdom, therefore glory is there; itis among enemies, therefore shame is there. But let us pass through honor and dishonor, through good tidings and evil rumors, through hatred and love, through friends and enemies, until we reach where friends alone are, and we are in the Father's kingdom, amen. Fare well in the Lord. December 3, Anno 1544. Yours, Mart. Luther, D.

It seems to me that the world has also come to the hour of its going, and is altogether obsolete like a garment (as the Psalm [102:27] says), and that it must soon be transformed, amen. There is nothing left among the princes full of heroic virtue, but incurable hatred and discord, avarice and their own lusts. Thus the commonwealth has no men and the third chapter of Isaiah is hurrying along in full course.

My daughter Margaretha thanks you for your gift.

It is with great sadness that | inform your honor that the help that our most gracious lord, out of special mercy, arranged for me at your intercession, from which | have now supported myself and my family for three years, has been denied and rejected by the administrator of the Abbey of Altenburg, who states that he has the order and may not give away anything else, unless new permission is obtained from our most gracious lord. Now your Honor knows that | am a poor man, overloaded with four children, afflicted with infirmity of body, as with a stupid face and weak head, who has nothing or can gain nothing, because what is given to me by God's grace through our gracious Lord and pious people is daily put before me.

God is my witness that | will not flee from my work, and | would have no greater joy and comfort or pleasure than to thank God and the Christian community for what | have heard from your honorable father and other my preceptors. and others of my preceptors, and earn and eat my bread by the sweat of my brow, as | did before with all my will and joy when | served the youth for 16 years, and it grieves me greatly that | must thus lie idle (as some think) and be a burden to other people, | am truly not idle, for | do not let any time pass, without all the glory of speaking, when | do not hear sermons or lections, teach my children, and let them read useful Christian books to me, or with them for the need of all of Christendom, for our Lord, for E.

which | alone, and no one else, can show to the church according to my present opportunity, have quite enough 1). Since, without this, one would have to be kept here to instruct the foreign ordinands, and | have always found myself willing and able to do so, | ask, for God's sake, that Your Eminence prescribe me as a submissive to Our Lord.

For this | will, as long as | have half my health, serve the church here with the intended instruction of the foreign ordinands willingly, diligently and faithfully, and besides that | will earnestly ask God the Lord for the welfare and salvation of this church, country and sovereignty with my own, and also constantly instill this in my children, in addition to Christian teaching, so that they will show their gratitude for such elemosyne with everything they can for the praiseworthy (laudable) House of Saxony throughout their lives. | hope that E. E. will heed such my request and necessary concern, and will also be helpful and supportive to me this time, as they have done to me so far in a fatherly and faithful manner. May God, the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has promised to reward all good deeds done to the least of His own, pay and reward Your Honor for such good deeds and support with all kinds of spiritual gifts, and keep you for the edification and preservation of His Church and the pure Word of God for a long time with yours in health, peace and joy, Amen.

Now his face is so corrupted that he cannot be used in service, although he likes to work and is well learned and able to speak. Because God has given him through E. ch. F.

For we find in the work that this work is necessary and useful. Therefore, the ordination should not only be a ceremony, but it should also be a serious investigation of doctrine and instruction, as many confess to us that they are usefully reminded by such instruction. To this good work may this E. ch. F. G.'s work, God will undoubtedly reward it abundantly; may He always be gracious to E. ch. F. G. always graciously preserve it.

Elevation and private absolution are not abolished. Images and elevation are indifferent things, but the former allow them as historical memories, and do not abolish them so as not to appear as iconoclasts. They retain elevation because of the sacramentarians, who deny the bodily presence of Christ; but private absolution because of the command of Christ, who commanded to absolve both in general and in particular. The opponents have aroused the whole city of Sibiu and also the council, which takes their side, so that almost a riot is to be feared. Therefore, they ask that the Wittenbergers send a letter to them, to the clergy, and also to the council about the three articles mentioned; they hope that this will restore peace. - The letters of reply from the Wittenbergers have not yet been found.

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have read your letter concerning the scholarship of Kemberg, and in your gracious opinion we do not know how to behave, that we do not remember any reasons for some disfavor given to us by Kemberg, nor have we forgotten them with the distribution of the scholarship, but have provided them with a scholarship, like other similar towns of ours. However, since the income of the three monasteries of Altenburg, Gotha and Eisenach has not yet been transferred, because many persons have pledged their fiefs and prebends for life or for a considerable period of time, we have not yet come to the execution of our entire order, which extends to 150 students, but to begin with, and so that they would not all have to wait for the settlement in question, we had to direct the division to 70 persons now, according to the occasion of the settled income, and assign them (as much as is ordered for the citizens' children) to the most distinguished cities. However, as soon as the income of the aforementioned monasteries continues to be distributed, those of Kemberg (Kemrick) shall also receive theirs, and ultimately all other of our towns, as many of which must now wait for the indicated distribution, shall also be provided in accordance with our gracious decree, which you shall give to those of Kemberg (Kemrick).

Pomeranus. 


Venerable and favorable gentlemen! | ask that you respond to our most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony and Burgrave of Magdeburg (Meidburg), according to these articles, and add what you will further consider good, better than I, that | be done with this detention and plague. 

First of all, that |, as an old and worn-out man, be spared. In one year, which | might not want to live out, | cannot set up again everything that has fallen into the bishop's territory and land at sixteen years of age, and thus has lain and been torn apart without regiment. And maybe in one year the kitchen and housekeeping would not be set up again and the buildings in the necessary rooms would not be improved again. | do not want to be their kitchen master, and if | could not do such things, they would then charge me that my neglect would be the cause of much damage. 

Since Actor. 6 [v. 2.] is written, that it is not fitting for us to drop the office of preaching, and burden ourselves with the other care of serving the table, why then should | burden myself with cares of such a great government of a dominion, which would soon withdraw me altogether from the studio and the office of preaching, and kill me, contrary to God's word, which saith, "The kings of the world reign; but ye shall not reign" M[atth. 6, 25. f.]. 


1) Since according to Voigt, "Bugenhagen", p. 409, this letter was given to the envoys on Jan. 1, 1545, it must be placed somewhat earlier.

Above this, there is also a lack of the costs necessary for the spiritual and secular government, because the highest prelatures, which previously served at their own expense in courts, visitation, dispatch and many other things, are now in the hands of such persons, They are now in the hands of such persons, who do not want to bear any expenses for the sake of the church, and the one who is called bishop would have to bear all expenses and work alone and order them into the bishop's land and outside of it, through such great principalities of both dukes of Pomerania, with visitations, sendings, courts 2c. 

And because the episcopal income could not bear such a thing, | could also not move to the churches in need 2c. 

Furthermore, it would not be possible for me to bring the torn away church properties, from which parishes and schools must be appointed and maintained, from those who hold them and do not want to give them back, to the churches again, especially because some boast that the sovereigns have given them the same properties, as they are also not urged by the princes to give the properties back. This tearing up of the estates would prevent me from helping the churches and schools, and thus the pious pastors, who now desire me and have great hope, would have hoped in vain, and | would have to leave the study and preaching ministry, which should be the most noble works of a bishop, and in which | now serve God, standing, which would be a heartache and cause of death to me. Why did they want to put me, an innocent man, to death? And if the improvement in the country would not follow, they would want to blame me, and if the reproach would finally come to the gospel: this would be the beautiful evangelical government! 

Lastly, | do not want to incur this offense, so that the enemies of the Gospel would say that we had removed the bishops from the chair and sat on them, and had sought their goods and not God's honor in punishment of the episcopal government. 

Therefore, in honor of the Gospel, | do not want to have the worldly honors, goods and splendor of the bishops, as | have twice before refused such bishoprics and did not want to accept them. 

However, | thank in submission the highborn princes and lords, the Dukes of Pomerania 2c., my gracious lords, and the venerable Chapter of Camin, that they have done me this honor, and have graciously and kindly applied for the bishopric without my prior knowledge or consent by writing and stately message, and have invited me to do so. 


3052 


The envoys know, however, how great and just cause | have told, why | do not intend to accept the bishopric, and for this reason there have been several days of talk and counter-talk between us, until the most noble and highborn prince and lord, the Elector of Saxony and Burgrave of Magdeburg, my most gracious lord, came here, on which negotiation, since they pressed on me with these words: If | did not accept it, there would be war and bloodshed between cousins, and such would be my fault, | agreed to accept the bishopric for a time, but with a condition and measure. 

The Pomeranian embassy was pleased with my 1) moderate permission, and thus returned home. But | became very sad and sorrowful afterwards that | had put myself in so much danger and evil burden with the same permission, for which | was moved out of fear, with these words: to worry about war if | did not accept it, and yet | had hung a measure and condition on it. Afterwards, however, God opened my eyes, so that | considered that | should not be afraid with this fear; God would thus graciously govern and preserve my gracious princes and lords, the dukes of Pomerania, so that they would not fall into one another; and if unrest were to occur that God would prevent, why should | answer for it in God's judgment? For although | do not accept the bishopric, they are still guilty of seeking another capable one, and have many more capable persons. O God! | have done a foolish thing; help me out of this matter for Your name's sake, through Your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ. Save me from this accident, into which | have fallen ignorantly, because of my sin; help me out of it by your mercy, as you have said: O Israel, destruction comes from yourself, but salvation comes from me; do not cast me away from your presence 2c. So | have prayed this time for and for, as in a high temptation, of which God is my witness, who has now heard my prayer. To Him be praise and thanksgiving. For | have heard before this time, and now | have heard more clearly from Duke Philip's writings, sent to my most gracious lord, the Elector 2c., that the princes have many reasons why the reported condition and measure, which are only suggested to them, are burdensome and not acceptable 2c. 

It follows that |, in turn, am free and free from my moderate grant and pledge of 


1) Kolde: "mean".

am. This is very dear to me, and my heart is restored to peace and joy, thanks be to God, who has helped me out through His dear Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen. 

Now they ask again, if | do not want to keep the bishopric for a long time, | should nevertheless accept it with other conditions and measures for a time. To this | answer clearly and finally: that | have decided entirely with myself not to accept the bishopric of Camin, regardless of all promises, conditions, measures, or threats, as if | should be guilty of it, so that unrest or war would 2c., which threats now, praise God, do not move or frighten my mind. For such disunity of the dukes, if | left again after a year or two, would again be new, and to worry about, more violent than now, and then the blame would be driven much more on me, would say: If you leave, you give cause for new disunity, you will have to answer for it before God, this war we have from Doctor Johann Bugenhagen Pomeranum. 

Therefore, | finally ask that they spare me, as an old, weak, worn-out man, and who is now a true bishop of our Lord Christ, and now shall have relief from his work, and afterwards eternal rest and joy. 

The noble, highborn prince, Duke Philipps, writes that | am required to the episcopal office. In response, | say that the Pomeranian princedoms, by the grace of God, have many humble and God-fearing men in many cities, who rightly lead and do the episcopal office. Thus | myself have been in the episcopal office for a long time and still am, | was also required by the noble, high-born princes and lords, the Dukes of Pomerania, my gracious lords, in the Pomeranian principalities some years ago for the true episcopal office and work of establishing right doctrine and church order, and | have accomplished this, as much as God has given me, through Christ, although | have accomplished less in it than in other places. 

About this | have offered myself, and willingly, if my gracious princes and lords, the dukes of Pomerania, and the venerable chapter have elected a bishop, and want to require and use me for spiritual matters, as for the visitation and improvement of the churches, that |, regardless of my age and weakness, want to travel there and advise and help for church order, and may not be charged that | do wrong, that | do not want to accept true episcopal work.

Concerns that in the Rochlitz district, where elevation had been abolished for years, it should not be reintroduced.

With the elevation in the Rochlitz circle we pay attention, so should be proceeded (furen). Because such a ceremony is freely recognized, and the Christian faith (where otherwise no evil addition occurs) is no driving in this: so let lie what has fallen. If the other falls afterwards, then it may also lie. But it should not be removed, unless there is some special need, which, since there is nothing in itself, is not easy to assume.

The widowed Duchess Elisabeth of Brunswick had invited Luther to the table, and her son, Erich the Younger, prayed in German and Latin before and after the meal. Luther was pleased about this, but he feared that the prince might be led away from the fear of God by the worldly life.

To the venerable and learned M. Antonio Corvino, our dear confrere in Christ, at Handelt in Munden. 


Dear Corvine, we have all heard here with heartfelt joy your young well-bred prince's Christian confession, which we 


uils be thoroughly pleased. May God, the Father of all graces, enlighten and preserve the young rulers in all the principalities of our beloved fatherland in such Christian education. The devil, however, is cunning and exceedingly crafty; thus our spiritual bishops, prelates and all godless princes of the true Christian religion and our enemies, by whose authority many Christian hearts are turned away and seduced. For this reason, with prayer and exhortation, always persevere for and against; for Ulan must fear where the young prince would have much fellowship with our adversaries, through (their) great reputation he could easily be provoked and driven to apostasy. | did not want to restrain you this time. Pray, pray without ceasing, for the church is in great danger; let Christ, the head, look up and put a stop to the lenient and the evil ones, amen. We command you to do the same.

To the most illustrious, highborn Prince and Lord, Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen, Burgrave of Magdeburg. The most gracious Lord, the Most Sublime Prince and Lord John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen, Burgrave of Magdeburg. 

Grace and peace in the Lord and my poor Pater noster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, G. H.! What the new Doctor George Major writes to E. C. F. G., E. C. F. G. will know from his enclosed writing 1) graciously to hear. So that | do not write much for the sake of other things, the sermon at the castle is such that people like to hear it very much; for he teaches very well, to which the city and the university (as much as they go in) give him excellent testimony, without my knowing otherwise that he is skilful and takes care of things with diligence. Even after he became a doctor, people began to complain that he would be torn away from preaching by the lecture; for | myself would rather keep a good preacher than a good reader. | report this to E. C. F. G. because it is not his place, D. Georgen Major, to boast of himself before E. C. F. G., that E. C. F. G. should consider how this is to be provided, especially because he does not desire longer than until the provostry is completely vacant, and at the same time it will be difficult to do four lectures and two sermons every week. However, | am placing all of this in the hands of E. C. F. G. and humbly request that E. C. F. G. be heard with a gracious answer. Hiemit dem lieben GOtte befohlen, Amen. On the New Year's Day 1545. 

E.C.F.G. subservient Mart. Luther. 


1) Burkhardt, p. 463, notes for explanation: Major asked, in view of the fact that he had 9 children, had built a house in Wittenberg, had gotten into debt through his doctorate, to give him, in addition to the 150 fl. which he received for the lection in Jonas' place, the preaching chair in the castle church with the income until the salary of the lection amounted to 200 fl. In addition, he asked for the continuation of the scholarship for his two adult sons. The Elector rejected Luther's request (January 4), because the position of the castle preacher had been otherwise disposed of, and the granting of the scholarship was against the established order for scholarship holders.

Grace and peace in Christ! | am very sorry, my dear Cordatus, and | sympathize with you from the bottom of my heart that Satan in the Mark (Marchicus == the Markish one) is again causing you trouble. | would advise you if | could, but nevertheless | am present with you with my prayers, and at the same time | ask you to keep your soul in patience, as the Lord teaches. God will also put an end to these things. | would have written to that Joachim Muller at the same time, if | had known what kind of man he was, whether a Papist, or somewhat ours, or neither; but | understand that he is an adversary. If he were one of ours, or pretended to be, | would tell him that because of these words, Christ is the ass, he should not do this travesty, and | would take the sin upon myself. lf he were a stranger, it would be quite evident that he would be the most detestable slanderer, since he knows that we do not want what he is inventing. Be patient, therefore, and do not answer his invectives. Let him enjoy his nonsense for a while, until | Know whether he is black or white, or which of the two he wants to be. It is Satan who tempts us, but he does not lead it out. He has killed Christ, but must suffer the resurrected one, the so great Lord and God, to eternal shame. Only long-suffering is necessary for us, with short-suffering (brevianimitate) we do not fix anything. In a short time a more, when | will have recognized the matter more completely. For what | have preached about the ten commandments, he will perhaps evade with ease, because he understands God under Christ. Therefore, carefully examine what he wants to confess, the pope or the gospel. Fare well in the Lord. January 4, 1545. Yours, Martin Luther.

you are called, and visit the churches, at least in your parish, where you have full rights to the parish. The Lord will be with you. If these or those centaurs should resist that you cannot visit, you are excused. Let them see for themselves, and shake the dust off your feet against them, as the gospel teaches. 

With me, there will be no delay in changing the preface to the Book of Visitation. But it cannot be finished in such a short time. Soon, as they have returned from the fair, | will deal with Joh. Luft and the bookkeepers that they take up the matter. Then perhaps this will also happen during the visitation, that certain things are to be arranged or omitted in a different way for this district of Naumburg, because of the inequality of the circumstances and the persons. For this is the way our visitation books were issued only after the visitation. And it will not be at all disadvantageous for the pastors if they are not given copies as soon as possible; the matter itself will teach everything. 

| have seen the bull or breve of the pope 1) but | thought it was a pasqnill. Now | think differently, after it is spread in all courts. | think that if this breve is genuine (verum), the papists are dealing with a great and outstanding monstrosity, that is, the pope will rather publicly worship the Turk and even Satan (as | have said several times from Virgil [Aen. lib. VII, v. 312]: If | cannot bend the gods, | will raise hell), than that he should be brought to order or reformed by the word of God. And the reasons for this are not hidden. But the Lord Jesus, who kills his adversary with the spirit of his mouth, will destroy him by the appearance of his future, amen.

Grace and peace! You complain, my dear 

Wenceslaus, that | neither write nor reply to your writings; then you add that you have not sent copies of your notes on Moses (although my wife has received one), because you are afraid to send them to us learned people, since we tend to despise these unlearned things.

Then you cannot consider us so worthy of hope that we should despise yours, since | have adorned your notes with a very long and well-wrought preface.

lam again sending you my lectures on Genesis, 

41 chapters, through M. Georg RGrer, who is also very busy and a servant of servants in printed matter (typographia). Therefore, you may also forgive him if you do not like them better than me.

3063 


To the most illustrious, highborn prince and lord, Herr Johanns Friederich, Duke of Saxony, Archmarshall and Elector of the H. R. Reich, Landgrave of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg, my most gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord, and my poor Pater noster. Most Serene, Highborn Prince, Most Gracious Lord! On E. C. F. G.'s letter and order that the jurists of the Consistorii and Court Court should compare notes with us theologians about the secret marriage, strange thoughts came to my mind, as if such an order would be impossible and in vain. For | knew very well until then that those in the court court speak strictly according to the pope's law in a different way than we do in the parish; | also still remember that some lawyers, even the great ones, had let themselves be heard to say that they could not speak according to our Catdnichs (that is what they call our books). Also some threatened that our wives and children could not inherit our goods after our death, but wanted to award it to our friendship 2c.; unless E. C. F. G. would let a new land law go out about it. | therefore let this speech be deleted and let them do what they did, as | was not commanded to do so. Nevertheless, we continued to stand for a while and did not want to speak in our parish church according to their papal scartecks, but according to our cathedrals; which, however few and insignificant they are, have nevertheless done more good in the church than all popes and jurists have done with all scartecks, let alone what damage they have done. So we swept our churches and parishes of secret vows, and what more of the lousy scartecks of the jurists was not convenient for us. Thus it was quiet, and we had fine peace from the secret vows. This lasted and lasted until the Consistory was established; then the rumbling began again, especially about Caspar Beyer. For it seems to me that the jurists let themselves think that they had now found a hole to rumble in my church with their annoying, damned trial, which | still want to be damned and cursed from my church today and forever.

have. For | have heard, and must hear especially from the young spoon lawyers, that they wanted to eat Easter eggs three times over this or that matter. And some great ones should have said that they wanted to bring up Caspar Beyer's things for another ten years, as | myself saw the acta directed in such a way. These would be happy guests in my church, which | should answer for before God, that such changers and pigeon dealers should make such a murderous pit out of my church. | would and would have to do otherwise, she has confessed me too much and great. 

Such thoughts were still fresh in my heart against the jurists, since E. C. F. G.'s writing came, and | was not willing to deal with them. However, by E. C. F. G.'s command, | summoned them to me, not at all in good hope, and only reproached them with how | did not intend to enter into disputation with them; | had divine command to preach the fourth commandment in this matter; | wanted to keep to it; whoever did not want to do so, would remain behind. 

Also that in E. C. F. G. letters of Duke Philipps consensu tacito or ratificante from the old rights undrawn, | would well know (if | were ordered) to answer, and to defend that Duke Philipps would not have kept silent nor given silent consent, as she herself, if she aired it, could do by her regulas juris. 

And even if it were so (as it is not) that Duke Philip should have given a silent consent according to the old laws (as they want to interpret them), | would not have submitted to the secular law in all things, but would have accepted the piece in the institutis, since the Emperor Justinianus introduces the natural law, and agrees with the fourth commandment of God. Otherwise, because the emperor now kisses the pope's feet with book, sword and crowns, | would also have to leave the gospel and crawl into the caps in the devil's name, out of power and might, spiritual and secular law. For this, E. C. F. G. would have to cut off my head along with all those who have married nuns, as the emperor Jovianus said more than a thousand years ago. 

When | told all of this, it was against my hope that they would all, both of them 





Consistorii and Court Court Jurists, agree to leave the secret engagement completely and reject it. Which | truly heard happily and gladly, and hereby humbly and humbly show to E. C. F. G. that we have indeed settled in this matter. 1) 


The Other. 

The woman, whose son is said to have married against her will, is said to be one of them (as they report me), who before granted (forgave) her son, after that became ranting, and want to scold the strumpet to honor. Against this the council and the whole city gave valid testimony. For we have often done this and done it right, when father or mother wanted to prevent their own children from honest marriage, we have not recognized them as natural parents, but as enemies of their own children, and without their gratitude have helped the children to marriage. 2) We have also done this in the past. This should also be done. 


The third. 

We do not know how to interpret the letter E. C. F. G., since it says of the gradibus or songs: the fourth degree should be forbidden inclusive. We think that it is provided with the pen, should be called exclusive, or the third inclusive, and consider that it is now so far established almost in all countries of our kinship, that the fourth degree is free and permitted, that it may now not be forbidden without great annoyance or disruption. But that the third may be forbidden, we have all considered useful and good, even in unison, to keep the breeding among this time wild naughty 3) people. 

This is what | wanted to give to E. C. F. G. this time as a humble answer to E. C. F. G.'s_ writing. Furthermore, Doctor Brick will also have heard and indicated.

3066 No. 3186. Wittenberg. January 20, 1545. To the city council of Amberg, together with Melanchthon. 


Letter of recommendation for Johann Faber, whom Luther sends them to preach. 


From Schenkl's Chronicle of Amberg, p. 220, in De Wette, vol. V, p. 718 f. and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 127. 


To the honorable, wise, and fair gentlemen, mayor and council of Amberg, our favorable lords and friends. 

God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, beforehand. Honorable, wise, favorable lords and friends! Although we recognize from your diligence in the appointment of preachers that you yourselves are inclined to the planting and preservation of the holy Gospel and right knowledge and invocation of God and to the promotion of Christian preachers, we have nevertheless given this document to the worthy Doctor Johann Faberio, who is known to you before, to kindly command him to you as a learned, God-fearing man, who is called to the service of the holy Gospel. W. will accept him kindly and show him good, as you yourselves know that all men on earth owe this service to God first of all, to accept the ministerium evangelii with reverence, to hear, to love, to help to preserve and to protect it, each according to his station, and thus also to do good to faithful preachers. And the world's hardness is right to deplore that it does not want to consider that God sent His Son and commanded with a clear voice from heaven: "This is the one you are to hear," and wants to be recognized and called only in this way, and only in this way to be saved through the one teaching given by Him, that nevertheless the greater number in the world persecute or despise the gospel. But if you, as godly men, love and honor the gospel of our Savior Christ, God will dwell with you, give you grace and blessedness, and will also preserve you bodily, as our Savior Christ says: "He who loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and he who loves me will be saved. 





we will come to him, and make our dwelling with him." This is a rich consolation, that God wants to have His dwelling place with and in those who gladly hear His Gospel, learn it and receive help. Therefore, let the holy gospel and Christian preachers be faithful to you, and we are willing to serve you kindly. Dat. Wittenberg, January 20, 1545.

Grace and peace in the Lord anda very happy year, Amen! Your son, Justus Jonas, reminded me, who is not Magister noster, 1) but rather our Magister, that | should write to you, my dear Jonas. For he said that you wish it, and it would be pleasant for you. Therefore | write, and | have nothing to write seriously, since you always precede in writing news, unless perhaps you do not know this: A letter from the pope is being circulated, which the Venetian friars have sent to Veit Dietrich, who is quite hopeful and fierce, to Emperor Carl the Fifth, in which he takes him to task with much and great, all-Italian hope, why he dares to permit and promise religious discussions, although his office is not to teach, but rather to hear and learn from the mother of the churches and the teacher of the faith. (These are words that are sufficiently known to you as an apostate jurist). Many doubt whether this thing is serious or the play of a pasquilla, but it does not seem to me to be nothing at all.

be. In addition, the speech was raised that Carl wanted to propose a reformation at the upcoming Imperial Diet, following the example of the church that was at the time of the Nicene Council. O, about the excellent reformation! If this is true, then the cause of the pope has come all the way to the rope, 1) or if itis a trap that they want to lure us to consent by this hope (which I rather believe), then the pope will mock us quite nicely as captives. For believing the promises of the Pope is the same as believing the father of lies (whose real son he is); but | would like the Pope to be forced to follow the example of the Nicene Council. Dear God, where would then remain your coadjntor, your executioner (Carnifex), your 2) cardinal? But let us pray earnestly while they play their game and mock God and all His creatures. It will happen, when they stop playing, that they will then seriously mourn in hell. 3) There you have what | could have written, not to write nothing. Farewell and pray for me. January 26, 1545.

For also the sister Barbara has shown herself very honorable in this matter, so that it seems to me 5) that it was the case that she was frightened by the oath, which was insisted upon after the prince had spoken. But with joy she and the sister seized this saying, so that | easily recognized, 6) that you are loved and have always been loved. Therefore, you again correspond to the love of the one who loves you and anxiously awaits you, and do not care about the words of Satan and satanic people, of which the world is full, but rejoice in God and in the girl he has given you. We await you with great desire and all the table companions wish you happiness. Fare well in the Lord. Tuesday after Paul's conversion [27 Jan.] 1545. Yours, Martin Luther.

The worthy Mr. George Buchholzer, provost of Berlin, has informed me that E. C. F. G. sends me her gracious greetings through him and is surprised that | do not write anything to E. C. F. G., and also requests that | send out a booklet against the two women. First of all, | humbly thank 


3071 


E. C. F. G. gracious greetings. However, E. C. F. G. should not interpret the fact that | do not write anything to E. C. F. G. as if it were out of displeasure. For my heart is such that | am not hostile or disfavored toward any man on earth; especially toward you princes and lords | cannot be disfavored, because | must pray for you daily, as St. Paul teaches in 1 Timothy 2. 2 See also what a poor thing it is for a ruler in this shameful time, when there is so much unfaithfulness among the rulers, and the devil of the court is a mighty lord; therefore discord and displeasure arise among all kings and princes. So | had no special reasons to write to E. C. F. G. Therefore E. C. F. G. may be sure that it will not remain due to any! Unwillingness remains. | have often said and preached that | am not angry with the Cardinal at Mainz either. Yes, | do not wish that he should have my calculum for an hour, although | attack him harshly; for | do not like to see him hurry and run to hell as if he were worried that he might miss it, if he can enter in time enough, when he is already slowly trying to enter foot by foot. But no admonition wants to create something there. 

For E. C. F. G. |am very worried that the Jews will prove their Jewish perfidy one day. But C.F.G. has such a strong faith and trust in them that my letter would be in vain, but | would have no faith at all; therefore | ask God to graciously protect C.F.G. from them, and also the young margraves, so that C.F.G.'s faith would not be too strong in this, lest something happen which would be too slow and futile for all of us afterwards. The provost pleases me beyond measure that he is so vehemently against the Jews. He loves E. C. F. G. with earnestness, | feel it well, and means them with loyalty. And | have strengthened him to stay on the track. For what they pretend with the alchemy is a great, shameful deception. It is well known that alchemy is nothing and can make no money without sophisticetum, which does not hold fire, like other gold, which some goldsmiths also know. 

Mr. George also admonished me and asked me to write E. C. F. G. for him.

We ask that E. C. F. G. graciously grant his two sons a spiritual fief so that they may be kept in the studio. It would be a pity that they should be neglected and abandoned. 

Summa, E. C. F. G. does not consider me an enemy, but | cannot believe that E. C. F. G. can believe, namely that the Jews mean E. C. F. G. with loyalty. And the alchymists certainly play with E. C. F. G. that they mean everything, and E. C. F. G. the niece, Doctor Jeckel makes me more devout than many others have told me.

| have been waiting for Amberg's letter and answer for days, so that he would know where he was, whom | would have liked to see instead of M. Spalatin. Now, according to his promise, he is already connected, and those from Amberg are here to fetch him. We have, praise God, a good supply of young theologians. But we must have so many in foreign countries that, where one is ripe, many hands ask for him, that we cannot suddenly give all the time who and what he wants. Some of our students, who are now pastors and preachers there, are already in Turkey and occasionally in Hungary. The cities also have very few students, and think that we have plenty of them here, and that they should be sent to them. Accordingly, M. Philipp and | have looked around and considered whether M. Augustinus 1) should not be called to Colditz. But we are told that he is weak. So we would like to have him at Jessen 2) there as well, because he is also thinking of leaving there. Finally, we are considering the schoolmaster at Altenburg, who is learned and old enough, also almost experienced in church matters, and known at Altenburg, and [it] has always been the case that the schoolmasters have given the best pastors, especially when they have been practicing in the school regiment for so long. To them we give E. C. F. G. to choose and provide what E. C. F. G. pleases. We do not know anything more or different this time until the others mature. | do not know what grows there in Leipzig or Erfurt.

The Zurich sacramentarians have written against me in Latin and German, 2) because of my booklet "Kurz BekenntniB". | have not yet decided whether | want to answer them, since they have been condemned by me so often, before and now. These people are enthusiastic, hopeful, then also idle. Although they were bravely silent in the beginning of the matter, when | alone had great difficulty in enduring the rage of the pope (sudarem), and looked on at my success or my danger, they soon burst forth, after the pope's power had been broken to some extent and room had been made for freedom, as glorious triumphants, who had nothing from others, everything through their own powers. Thus, yes, thus one works, and another enjoys it. Yes, they direct their attack at me, through whom they have been liberated.

against the papacy, if the forces allow it. 

The emperor in the Netherlands, the Frenchman in France rage cruelly against the gospel, and Ferdinand in Hungary and Austria is not milder. Thus Caiphas advised that the Son of God must be slain, lest they lose their land and people. Thus they cannot overcome the Turk unless they have defiled their hands with the blood of the martyrs and the brothers of Christ. The final wrath of God has come upon them. May the Lord hasten the day of our redemption, amen. May Your Honor be well in Him. On the day of Tiburtius [April 14] 1545.

To Christoph Jorger. 


Luther wishes him luck that he is relieved of his office, through which he came into trouble with his conscience. On the Suppression of the Gospel in Austria. 


Printed in Raupach's Evang. Oesterreich, 1st cont., p. 71; in Moseder, GlaubensbekenntniB, p. 72; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 729 and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 131. 

Grace and peace in the Lord. Dear Lord and friend! | am glad to hear that you have been released from your office and have found better peace of conscience. We gladly listened to Mr. Leopold, secretary, and offered the service and will of our small fortune, for which he needs us. The Father of all mercy must have mercy on the fact that the good word is so difficult for you. The lords are partly wicked people, and they are like King Ahaz of Jerusalem, who also, the more misfortune overtook him, the more he strove against God, that | can well think that where God will not honor His holy name, it cannot be good for the sake of the lords, so they weigh down the consciences and strengthen the enemy of Christ, the Pafft, that many souls must remain without God's word. Therefore, it is necessary to pray earnestly that the dear Father will not look at our merits and the ravings of our enemies, but at His mere grace and mercy, and honor His name in us who are unworthy, so that the Turk will not boast, "Where is your God? 


For he has boasted enough, and has come up with murders and blasphemies; may God control and ward him off and make an end of him, amen. Greetings to your dear mother. Hiemit GOtt befehlt, Amen. At Wittenberg, April 17, 1545, Martin Luther.

To Caspar Heidenreich. Luther consoles him over the loss of his newborn son. Handwritten in the Cod. chart. Goth. 402, f.; 185.4. and 1048. Printed in Schelhorns Ergétzlichk., vol. 1, p. 82; in Strobel- Ranner, p.350; in Schitze, vol, |, p. 343 and in De Wette, vol. V, p. 729 f. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | hear that a son has been born to you, my dearest Caspar, but that in your absence he has been both born and died, which they say you bear very heavily, because you have not seen the fruit of your flesh. But cease from sorrow, rather rejoice that he is born again in Christ, and that thou shalt see him in glory, whom thou hast not seen here in this misery, as the wise man saith [Wis. 4:11], "He is passed over, that wickedness should not corrupt his mind, nor false doctrine deceive his soul." He has completed the course, and in a short time has passed through many times. But you know all this yourself, who can and must teach others such things. But thou doest not wrong in being somewhat moved by carnal and natural affection as a father (this name is an exceedingly sweet one). For we are not stones, neither ought we to be, but in these things we must keep moderation. Fare well in Christ. April 24, 1545.

G. and may bring my testimony, to which | know that E. F. G. may well suffer my writing with gracious patience. We know nothing new. One says the Turk is coming; the other says he will stay outside. But it is certain that neither emperor, nor king, nor princes are preparing. The emperor is beginning to fiercely persecute the Gospel in the Low Countries. God turn it, amen. The Bishop of Céllen still stands firm by God's grace. Thus Count Palatine Frederick, Elector, accepted the Gospel, with his Electress, this Easter took the Sacrament of both forms publicly and confessed it. To God be praise and glory, and strengthen them, Amen. The Roman abomination is still mimicking the Emperor and the Empire with his Concilio, which he has postponed from Mid-Lent until Michaelmas, and has also let himself be heard in Ferrar that it is still far away; this is certainly the true word that comes out of the lying mouth; for they cannot suffer a Concilium for eternity.

Grace and peace in the Lord! "Jeckel" has been here a whole eight days, my dear George, and as if he were mute, he shows himself in the inn as one who is not a man (quendam non hominem).

For | wish very much to be damned by this monster, if perhaps in this way | could be freed from his company and fellowship with him and all his friends. You continue as you do to teach Christ pure, and let Satan rage and boast. "Grickel" is "Grickel" and will remain "Grickel" forever. Fare well in the Lord. Given on May 2, 1545.

In the emperor's letter, they are called 1) his, the emperor's, daughter. O wretched emperor, who must be the father of such great, shameful, abominable whores! Well, the pope is mad and foolish from the top of his head to his heels, that they know not what they do or speak. There is no doubt that if a council were to be held, they would decide on such wisdom and even greater wisdom. But | think they are so wise, especially their holy spirit, Mainz. But | think they are so clever, especially their holy spirit, that they will let the concilium, like the unripe barley, stick in the cap, so that they cannot leave the word. | consider the other part of the newspaper about the Concilio at Trent and those who are supposed to be there to be Roman and Magian gossip and twaddle, which they themselves should be sorry for if it had to become true. God does not want them, and they do not want to be either. Let it go, it will be all right. Hereby be E. C. F. G. commanded to the dear God, who governs and protects E. C. F.

No. 3218. May 7, 1545. To the City Council of Halle. 


Luther exhorts him to continue in zeal and faithfulness for the gospel. 


(Wittenberg.) 


Printed in the Altenburg edition, vol. VIII, p. 473; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXI, p. 521; in Walch, vol. XXI, 507; in De Wette, vol. V, p. 737 f. and in the Erlangen edition, vol. 56, p. 135. 

Grace and peace in the Lord. Honorable and prudent, dear sirs and good friends! | have talked with my dear Lord and friend D. Jonas about all kinds of things, especially church matters, and heard from him quite happily how your church in Halle has almost increased and is well blessed by the Holy Spirit, that the people are very well behaved, and the teachers have one heart and one mouth among themselves, and the council is also inclined toward the Gospel. 

The merciful God and Father of all joys and unity wanted to increase and maintain His gracious blessings among you, and to accomplish His work begun in you until that day! It is a great grace and treasure, where a city can sing with one accord the psalm: Ecce, quam bonum et quam jucundum, habitare fratres in unum. For | learn daily, alas, how strange such a gift is in the cities and in the countryside. For this reason | have not been able to refrain from showing you all my joy, and also from asking and exhorting, as St. Paul did to those in Thessalonica, that you continue in this way and, as his word says, ut abundetis magis, and become stronger and stronger. For we know that Satan is an enemy to us, and cannot suffer such God's work in us, but 1) prowls about, seeking whom he may devour, as St. Peter says. Therefore it is necessary to be courageous and to pray that we will not be overtaken by him. For we are not unaware of what he has in mind; thus he still has great space with you, as on the Morizburg and at Aschenburg, 2) in addition to others, so that he has also now blessed or cursed two nuns (God may redeem the souls again, amen), by which he proves what he would like to do more. 


1) "but" put by us instead of: especially. 

2) This name occurs only here. We assume _ that "Aschaffenburg" is to be read, because this belonged at that time to Chur-Mainz. 


Thereupon | have diligently asked my dear Lord Doctor Jonas to keep the church, council, preachers and school together all the more diligently, so that you may resist the devil with earnest, united, strong prayer and faith, whether he would do anything further than he certainly intends to do without ceasing; as | know that Doctor Jonas has done this faithfully beside you up to now, and will do so again. 

Commend to your Christian love the preachers, church servants and schools, especially Doctor Jonas, whom you know that we would not like to let him go, and | myself would like to have him around me. They are precious, such faithful, pure, fine preachers, we experience that every day. God Himself esteems them dear, as He says: "Few are the workers," and St. Paul: "Here is found who is found faithful. Therefore, he also commands to have them in double honor, and to recognize that they are God's great, special gifts, so that He 3) honors the world to eternal blessedness, as Ps. 68 sings: dedit dona hominibus. t is not much less of a gift, since God has given you such a heart to call, love and value them and honor them in the Lord. In many places they are considered very worthless, and caused to turn away, and also urged to flee. Then they see all too late what they have done, according to the saying, "| know what | have, but | do not know what | get. For to change is easy, but to improve is miserable. May the Father of our dear Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you against all the wickedness of Satan, and protect you from all his cunning attempts, and grant you a time of peace from the wicked, treacherous flesh and blood, amen, amen.

To the in Christ venerable father and lord, Mr. Nicolaus, the right and faithful bishop of the church at Naumburg, his in your Lord highly honorable superior. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! With the three furies, venerable Father in Christ, | had nothing else in mind, when | painted them at the pope, than that | expressed the frightfulness of the papal abomination with the most frightening words in Latin. For the Latins do not know what Satan or the devil is, any more than the Greeks and all pagans. Therefore they have formed these names afterwards (a posteriori) and according to the performances [of the devil] (effectu). The mega era has its name from envy and hatred. 1) This is the devil's malice, which envies the eternal and the temporal salvation of the human race ("hinders the good") 2) just as the pope does, the imitator and monkey of Satan. The alecto is called, as it were, the incessant attacker. This the poets make the worst of all and that brings sadness ("drives all evil"), which commits the terrible things in the world, as patricide, matricide. We Christians can call this devil the old serpent, who in paradise ruined the human race in innumerable ways full of misery and evil with eternal and temporal sadness, and still daily fills the world with new sadness through the pope, the Mahomet, the Cardinals, the bishop of Mainz 2c., and cannot stop or moderate his sadness-inducing infliction of misfortune 2c. Tisiphone is called the avenger of murder. Of this one it is fabled that she is a (passive) furia capable of sensation ("provokes his wrath"), that is, the wrath of God with which the tyrants and the wicked are punished for the effects of the two preceding furias, as suffered by Kam, Saul, Absalom, Ahitophel, at 





1) odeo at De Wette will be a misprint instead of: odio. 2) This and the following parenthetical theses written by Luther in German are in the margin. 


we Christians would quite actually call the evil spirits (daemones), by which the possessed are overcome and the nonsensical rage, which also blasoheme God. This fury reigns mainly in the opinions and the blasphemous teachings of the pope and the heretics, who are condemned for the due reward of their error. | have nothing else. 

| have decided not to answer the enthusiastic Zurichers, except briefly and casually. 3) It is superfluous for me to write against Zwingli and Oecolampad; they have not yet touched those things, and | do not want to lose this time of my old age with those hopeful and idle readers. Nor do | want to bring myself to read their writings, and | am satisfied that their testimony proves that | am quite far from their ravings. This is what | had in mind when | made my last confession [of the Lord's Supper. Fare well in the Lord, amen. May 8, 1545.

Elector Johann Friedrich to Luther. 


He sends Buchhoizer's letter back to Luther, and testifies that he is pleased that Luther did not let Agricola go before him, nor did he intercede for him. News that the Margravine of Lichtenberg has agreed against her son, the Elector of Brandenburg, to return to the Mark on the condition that Agricola and Schenk be dismissed and that righteous preachers be appointed in their place. 

From your Concept in Férstemann's "Neues Urkundenbuch," p. 355. 


To Doctor Martinum. Johans Friedrich 2c. 


Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have received your letter together with the enclosed letter (which we are sending back to you herewith), in which it is reported what measure the prisoners in Berlin, who led away the students in Wittenberg, have escaped, and have heard all the contents. And another thing is that the devil and his followers are almost very hard on us, but the Almighty has graciously helped so far, and he will undoubtedly help again, first of all so that these boys, if they want to do something evil against us and ours, will not succeed. You have done us a special favor by not allowing Eisleben to come to you when he was in Wittenberg, nor by forbidding him to come to us. And we do not want to reprove you in your gracious opinion, after our friendly dear grandparents, brothers-in-law and brothers, the Elector and Margrave Hans of Brandenburg, have now been with their dear wife's mother in Lichtenburg, that they have kindly addressed their loved ones and asked them to join them again in the Mark, which her beloved ones then agreed to a certain extent, but especially that the Elector should remove the said Eisleben and Doctor Jakoben from himself and away, and provide himself with other Christian and righteous preachers, and also keep it otherwise with the ceremonies in conformity with the others. Thereupon the Elector shall have made such a promise to her beloved. 





If this were to happen, it is to be hoped that Eisleben and Doctor Jakob would no longer have their being and staying in this place. Then, too, you would undoubtedly not refrain from your Christian and possible support of the Elector's Christian work and project. We would not have you do such a thing, and are inclined to you with grace and good. Dated Torgau, Tuesday after Vocem Jucunditatis [May 42] 1545.

Our greeting before. Venerable and esteemed, dear devotees, councilors and faithful! We have received your letter together with the enclosed citation to our friendly dear grandmother and brother- in-law, Duke Philipsen of Brunswick, regarding the marriage matter of H. L.'s son, Duke Ernsten, with the virgin Anna, Ernsten von Starfchedel's, blessed, deceased daughter, and have heard its contents, and would have been inclined to send your citation to the said Duke Philipsen. However, the appointed day and date of S. L.'s concern will be somewhat short, moreover, it is also necessary that the said maiden Anne's guardians and brothers be cited and summoned by you, but this was left by you and without doubt because you did not know who they were. Therefore, it is our gracious request that you extend the day for about ten or twelve days, and that you change the citation to Duke Philipsen, which you will find 1) above, and likewise to the maiden guardians, namely Dieterichen von Starschedel, her cousin, and Heinrich and N. Wolf von Starschedel, her brothers, at Mutschen, and then send it to us, [so] we want them to be ordered to the proper end. We do not want you to do this, and we are pleased to do so.

From the Stuttgart library in Burkhardt, p. 471. 


Grace and peace in Christ, who is our consolation, yea, who is wholly ours, and we are wholly his, as Paul saith [Rom. 14:8.], "Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's." We have heard that you, dear and exceedingly dear Osiander, have again been deeply afflicted, and that at the same time by a twofold affliction, namely by the death of your wife 1) and your exceedingly lovely daughter. And | certainly and very strongly believe, through the example of the daughter who is extremely dear to me, 2) that her death causes you very special pain. It is extraordinary how much | am tormented by the death of my Magdalena, whom | cannot yet forget. But | know for certain, 3) that she is in the place of refreshment and eternal life, and that God has given me a great sign of His love in this very thing, that He has taken my flesh into His bosom during my lifetime. But this is a natural love, 4) as 


1) From a letter of Melanchthon to Veit Dietrich from Aug. 5, 1537, we see that the first wife of Osiander had died around this time, and that Luther also wrote a letter of comfort to him at that time. The letter is missing. See Corp. Ref., Vol.V, 399. 

2) Instead of filii charissimi we have assumed filie charissime (in the original we will probably find filie charissime), because Luther did not lose a son by death.

About an unusual behavior of foxes, about which Luther asked hunting experts; about the course of time and an offensive painting by Lucas Cranach. 


The original is at Dresden in Cod. Seidel. Printed by Schttze, Vol. I, p. 350 and by De Wette, Vol. V, p. 741. German by Walch, Vol. XXI, 1545. 

To the venerable Father in the Lord, the Bishop of the true and holy Church at Naumburg, the upright servant of Christ, his highly venerable superior. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | have, reverend Father in the Lord, submitted your question about the monstrosity of the foxes to people who are experienced and skilled in the art and practice of hunting and who are completely masters in this art. At first they said that what | said could not be true.

said. Soon after | showed them your letter, they were amazed beyond measure. They unanimously claimed that the fox, with its cunning, does not rob where it has its nest. Kéthen was mentioned, where foxes have their nest in the so-called city moat (fossata oppidi), but do not harm anyone in that place. What this means, | do not know, unless perhaps a change of all things is imminent, which we ask for and expect, amen. 

| do not care about imperial diets and conciliation, believe nothing, hope nothing, think nothing. It is all vain. The Nurembergers have captured a certain nobleman in the hope that they would free their tree- gardener in turn. If God does not step into the means, this seems to be a spark of a future conflagration, for punishment over Germany; but first He takes us and ours away from this misery. There is no justice, no regiment in the kingdom, and it is a kingdom without rulership, that is, the yeast and the end of the kingdom. 

Your nephew George showed me the painting of Pabst, but "Master Lucas is a crude painter". He could have spared the female sex for the sake of God's creature and our mothers. He could have painted other figures befitting the pope, namely more diabolical ones; but you will judge. Fare well in the Lord, in Christ. June 3, 1545.

Postscript. 

The Emperor has ordered the Augsburgs to accept the Cardinal, that is, their bishop with the clergy and the papal ceremonies, but those are preparing to protect themselves by force of arms. "The parsons do not want" peace, nor to possess theirs with peace. Let it be done what is demanded. 


No. 3232. (Wittenberg.) June 15, 1545. To Nicolaus von Amsdorf, Bishop of Naumburg. 


Luther complains of stone pains, which prevent him from writing. Cranach is to produce a respectable painting instead of the offensive one.

Grace and peace! | give thanks, my venerable Father in Christ, for the gift of wine. | have not slept nor rested this whole night from the pain of my tormentor and Satan, the stone. Therefore | am of no use this day. It has not yet gone away, but is hidden in the body, but not without making itself felt, this thorn of my flesh. | do not know when | will give birth to this hateful fruit. | wish to die, but | detest this torture. But if it should be the will of the dear God that | should depart in such great torments, he will give grace to ask them, and if not to die sweetly, yet bravely. Enough of this. 

| will work diligently, if | remain alive, so that the painter Lucas exchanges this abominable painting with a more honorable one. | had already planned a vain second part against the pope and something short against the Sacramentarians, and behold! there breaks in my stone, my stone, but God wanted it to be not only mine, but also the pope's and the sodomitic (Gomorraeorum) cardinals’, so that they would have something that would say that they were human.

G. and F. in the Lord! Most noble, highborn prince, most gracious lord! | have previously proposed E. C. F. G. to the parish of Colditz, if M. Augustinus would leave, M. Johann Rosenberg, the child of the same country, therefore his wife is also, and well known to the people. But | do not know where he stayed and how the parish stands. That is why he is now here himself, to inquire whether he might get the parish there at Colditz according to my report or not. | still testify as before that he is a fine man, and | worry that he will not be able to remain lukewarm under Ferdinando the King.

S. Jacobi and Laurentii at Zwickau, from his forefathers and kinsmen, namely to the descendants Lasan and Jungnickel, which Jungnickel now died without heirs, so donated that it should be given to them with this duty, that they should study in a university for a named time, and this fief has remained with the Lazans until now, according to the foundation, and has only been relinquished this past year, because of which the common caste of the church in Zwickau intends to take it. Since this fiefdom is not just founded on fairs, but expressly endowed to the studio forever, so that some of this family will be Lasan, he asks in submission, S. 1) C. F. G. will graciously decree that the said fief be used for the studio of the poor youth and children of the Lasan family, as it has been held here in Wittenberg with a fief of ZUlsdorf 2) and otherwise, has also requested us that we may, on the authority of E. C. F. G., request that the fief be used for the studio of the poor youth and children of the Lasan family. which we therefore did not refuse, first of all that we do not consider that his request is contrary to the visitation, especially because the common caste has otherwise received large, stately endowments, namely four fiefdoms, from its forefathers, and we ourselves held it in the visitation in such a way that we left something to the families, from which something stately came to the common caste, although no report of the study was made. - Thus, E. C. F. G. of this man in Zwickau knows that he also took on the task of raising his brother's eight poor orphans, and by God's grace he himself has five sons and two daughters, whom he diligently raises to God's honor, and several of his sons are well-suited for the studio. Therefore, we ask in submission, S. C. F. G. will graciously show themselves in this, and for the promotion of the studies and preservation of these good pious people, who have been so long in Zwickau, and have borne common burdens, namely at three and a half hundred years, leave this help to their children for the studio.

God's grace through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Savior, before. Sublime, highborn prince, gracious lord! E. F. G. knows without a doubt himself all the opportunities of the trade, how Peter Schwab and Simon Wolder of Stolpen, by evil reports, have come into disrepute with the noble, highborn prince and lord, Mr. Barnim, Duke of Pomerania, our lord. H[errn], in disgrace, and that subsequently takes place, that they cannot again be safe in their estates. Although we do not make ourselves judges, we nevertheless consider this matter to be one in which the honorable Barnim reports badly, and that the men of Stolpen are being treated unfairly. However, after we had asked Duke Barnim for remembrance and intercession, we did not know how to refuse this "out of Christian compassion": We also considered writing to E. F. G.. For even though E. F. G. has nothing to do with this matter, E. F. G. can nevertheless kindly remind us that 2) these people will be released from the unjust burden. For this reason, we request that E. F. G. graciously promote such a thing, as you yourself will indicate that it is possible and fruitful to do. We can well

that the harshness did not originate from Duke Barium's person, therefore to hope, if S. F. G. would be better informed, they would show themselves more merciful. Thus, the F. F. G. know by which persons 3) a better report should now be made. In this, the F. F. G. want to mean that the work is primarily pleasing to God, to promote right things and to prevent unjust oppression, as it is written in the Book of Solomon Prov. 24, 11, you shall help to save (speak) those who are unjustly led to death, for God will reward such. Thus the noble princes and dukes of Pomerania have always been considered lovers of justice, and are now praised in the confession of the Holy Gospel as Christian, benevolent princes. Therefore, they should be all the more diligent in preventing injustice and trouble. Let the F. F. G. command them in the matter as much as possible, and God will reward them for it. May He always graciously govern and preserve the F. F. G., Amen. Datum Wittenberg, am Tage Visitationis und der fréhlichen Zusammenkunft Maria und Elisabeth [2. Julia] Anno 1545.

Geusing 1) (Gensing). He has approached the widow of M. Ambrosius Berndt, my niece Magdalena, and lured her with many and big words, so that it seems that he is looking for nothing else than her little bit of money, under the pretext of marriage. When | learned this, | became very agitated, because the unknown and so young person (for he has not yet exceeded twenty years) seems to be setting an ambush for me by the devil, since he, without consulting me and my family, also without giving any indication of his father or his origin, is dragging the poor and foolish woman around. Therefore | ask you, for the sake of our loyal friendship, to let yourself be burdened with this matter, and to find out for me his relatives, and if you can, either his father or his family, what they are like, or what they are worth, but especially whether they know that their son or relative is doing such things. For if he should perhaps have written to them that he has my consent and good will, or that of my family, you can always say that it is a lie. For we advise against it with the utmost strength, because this is neither suitable for him nor for her. And | would like the young man to be called back by his parents before | am forced to act more harshly against him. For my duty cannot suffer that he undertakes a marriage in this church without the knowledge of his father, much more wavy with my niece, since | have already condemned this example for two years against the lawyers. Summa: It seems to me serious to act everything in a lying way and to have the foolish woman as a fool, by doing this to my disgrace through the malice of the devil.

As soon as | had read this letter from the reverend father, | immediately went to Maxen with Diaconus Christoph Justi and my _ brother, Balthasar Lauterbach, to Georg Reuchel, pastor of the church, the father of this young man, who assured me in a modest answer that he and his son would do nothing against the will of D. Martinus, and he showed a letter from his son, who announced that he had been seriously admonished by Phil. Melanchthon on St. John's Day that he should not do such great things with the widow. He added these words to the letter: "I would like to be satisfied with this widow, if | can get rid of her. For she will not let me" 2c.

No. 3237. (Wittenberg.) July 9, 1545. To Nicolaus von Amsdorf, Bishop of Naumburg. 


About the Emperor's strange insistence that the Protestants should attend the Concilium, and about the peace negotiations with the Turks.

Grace and peace in the Lord! | would write if | had something to write, venerable Father in Christ. For | suppose that everything is better known to you than to us. It is written from the Imperial Diet that the Emperor is very insistent that our people consent to the Concilium; since the 


3114 


We are told that he is very unwilling to do this. What this monstrosity is | do not understand. The pope cries that we are heretics and should have no place in the Concilium; the emperor wants us to consent to the Concilium and its decisions. Perhaps God makes them fools; indeed, since Satan reigns, they are all utter nonsense, since they condemn us and at the same time ask our consent. But this seems to be their furious wisdom, because up to now they could not make their very bad cause fearful under the name of the pope, the church, the emperor, the empire, so now they intend to use the name of the concilium, so that they have something to shout against us, namely that we are such shameful people that we do not want to hear the pope, nor the church, nor the emperor, nor the empire, now not even the concilium, which has been demanded of us so often. Behold the wisdom of Satan against our foolish God! How will He be able to escape such cunning plots? But it is the LORD who will mock the mockers. If we are to consent to such a concilium, why did we not consent 25 years ago to the Lord of Conciliums, the Pope, and to his bulls? First let the pope acknowledge that the concilium is above him, and let him hear the concilium against him, just as his conscience testifies against him: then let us discuss the whole question. "They are mad and foolish, thank God. 

The emperor, Ferdinand and the Frenchman are seeking peace with the Turk, and it is thought that the emperor will turn his arms against us. But David says [Ps. 109, 4]: "But | pray"; let the will of the Lord be done. Fare well in the Lord, my venerable father. We are both old, may have to be buried in a short time.

No. 3238. (Wittenberg.) July 10, 1545. 


To George, Prince of Anhalt. 


At the prince's request, Luther speaks out about the ceremonies. 


Printed by Beckmann, Historie des Furstenthums Anhalt; by Lindener, Mittheilungen, Vol. Il, p. 96, No. 66 and by De Wette- Seidemann, Vol. VI, p. 378. 

To the reverend father in Christ and noble prince and lord, Lord George, the right and fair bishop of the church at Merseburg, prince of Anhalt, count of Ascanien and lord in Bernburg, his gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Doctor Augustin has very diligently urged me to write a letter to E. F. G. about the ceremonies. And | confess that | am not fond of the necessary ceremonies either, but an enemy of the non-necessary ones. Experience has burned me and still burns me, not only in the papacy, but also the example of the old church. For it happens easily that ceremonies become laws; but after they are issued as laws, they soon become cords of conscience, and pure doctrine is obscured and overwhelmed, especially if the descendants should be cold and unlearned, who quarrel more about ceremonies than that they should kill the carnal sense, as we see it even while we are still alive, and see divisions and discord arise, since everyone follows his own sense. Summa: the contempt of the word on our side and the blasphemy on the side of the adversaries seem to me to announce the time that John foretold to his people, namely [Matth. 3, 10.]: "The axe is already laid to the root of the trees" 2c. Since the end is at hand, it seems to me, at least at this blessed time, that it is not necessary to be too concerned about setting up ceremonies and bringing them into conformity, and even to fortify them by a constant law, but that this one thing must be done, that the word be taught purely and abundantly, and learned and capable church ministers must be appointed, who first of all see to it that they are one heart and one soul. 


3116 


in the Lord. This will naturally make it easy for the ceremonies to be brought into agreement or tolerated. Without this, there will be no end nor measure of disagreement in ceremonies. For the descendants will use the same force that we use, and it will be flesh against flesh, as the corrupted nature brings. Therefore | cannot give this advice, that in every place there should be uniformity of ceremonies everywhere, but where obviously ungodly or unrighteous ones have been done, one may tolerate unequal ones, as if some have fallen somewhere, they should not be restored; if they have remained, they should not be abolished. Such is the case with the altars, which are set in their usual places, and with the sacred or secular garments of the preachers, and similar things. For if there be One Heart and One Soul in the Lord, the one will easily bear the unformity of the other in this. If there is no striving for unity in heart and soul, the outward unity will be of little avail, but will also not last long in the descendants, since these are customs that are subject to the place, the time, the person, the coincidences, in which the kingdom of God does not stand, since they are changeable by their nature. However, whatever they may be, one must be careful not to turn them into necessary laws. And it seems desirable to me that, just as a schoolmaster or a householder governs without laws, but corrects the faults of either the school or the house according to the law of God by good supervision alone, where they see that one steps out of discipline, so also in the church everything should rather be governed by present supervision than by laws that are left behind. For where the supervision of the father of the house ceases, there also ceases the discipline of the servants, as the proverbs say: The eye of the Lord maketh the horse fat, and: The footsteps of the Lord fertilize the field. Thus, all power lies with capable and (as Christ says) wise and faithful persons. If we do not call such persons to govern the church, we will try in vain to govern by laws without such persons. And what necessity is there that everything should be done in the same way?

The Greek churches have always been different from the Latin churches in how many ways. And in how great unevenness have the Greek churches always been different from the Latin. This is why we insist on the establishment of schools and, above all, on purity and uniformity of doctrine, which unites hearts and souls in the Lord. But the people who study are rare, many are nothing but bellies seeking pasture to feed themselves, so that more than once the thought has occurred to me that it would happen that because of necessity the village pastors would have to be reduced, and instead of them some learned and faithful man would be appointed, who would visit the neighboring villages several times during the year, preaching loudly and diligently, while in the meantime the people would go to their mother church to receive the sacraments, or the sick would be administered [the sacrament] by the deacons. Thus, the matter and the time will teach many things that cannot be predetermined or established by laws. There E. F. G. have for this time briefly what is my opinion. But the Lord, with His Holy Spirit, "without whose power of God there is nothing that man can do, there is nothing that is not harmed" 1), guide E. F.

Luther does not speak out against the premonitions attached to the toppling of a statue. From the Concilium and from the legation to the Turks. 


The original is in Cod. Seide/ at Dresden. Printed by Schitze, vol. Ill, p. 222 and by De Wette, vol. V, p. 750. German by Walch, vol. XXI, 1551. 

To the in Christ venerable father and lord, Mr. Nicolaus, the right and faithful bishop of the church at Naumburg, his superior in the Lord 2c. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! Nothing moves me, venerable Father in Christ, that what you write has happened. Do not worry about dreams, he says; the Scripture teaches the same, unless someone is a prophet, as is said in Numbers 12:6. But this sexton is not a prophet. Then the statue of the prince that is erected in Torgau is made of wood. | have seen it in the Hanse of Lucas before it was painted.

About the other matter, which only the servant presented orally, about old and infirm concubine keepers, | think so, that we can neither allow nor permit fornication nor any future sin; if, however, they are so old that one can have hope to them that the evil lust with the flesh is gone and dead, so that they have these their old wives only to dwell with them and for domestic service, they could be admitted to them in such case, although such would not be admitted without danger, since the forbidding law (as Rom. 5 and 6 fund 7]') ) also incites dead sin; but having received from them the promise of safety (cautione), we can leave all this danger on their head, and are excused by the fact that we have warned them, and have indulged their need alone by believing their promise and assurance given. Love does not sin when it believes everything and assumes the best from the brothers, especially since we are helped to this easy belief 2) by the very probable inability and the long-satisfied pleasure. In the case of the strong and those in danger, our love warns us sufficiently that we should not trust them. Here E. F. G. has my thoughts, but the Lord will give better. May E.F.G. be well, amen.

The University of Wittenberg to the Elector Johann Friedrich. 


They ask the Elector to cooperate in making Luther give up the decision he expressed in the previous letter to turn away from Wittenberg. 


Printed in the Altenburg edition, Vol. VIII, p. 501; in the Leipzig edition, Vol. XXI, p. 529 and in Walch, Vol. XXI, 257*, No. XVIII. - We have transferred this letter here from the gleanings of this volume. 


God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Savior beforehand. 

1 Sublime, highborn, most gracious Elector and Lord! After we know that Ew. churfirstl. Since we know that Your Electorate is burdened with the highest and most important matters that may occur in the Christian Church and in human government, we only know that we owe it to Your Electorate to call upon God with all our hearts. We know only that we owe it to ourselves to call upon God with all our hearts on behalf of Your Electorate. We would not like to cause more grief to Your Lordship. However, a document has arrived from the venerable Doctor Martin Luther, our dear father, the copies of which we have not known to Your Electoral Grace. We have not known how to behave, although we have no doubt that Your Electoral Grace will not be less concerned about the matter. will find the matter no less distressing than much else. 





of the most burdensome things. The said doctor writes almost this opinion, that he is not willing to come back to Wittenberg, as he also intended to go away before this year, whereupon the venerable pastor and other persons, as on behalf of the church, university and city, sent to him, and also asked him with tears for it. 

We have now considered sending the pastor and several other persons to him with this humble request and advertisement that he not turn away his mind and good will from this church, university and city of Wittenberg. And even if he wants to leave from time to time for the sake of his health, even if he wants to spend some days in Oertern, where he thinks he has his refreshment, this would have its way. However, in all humility and for God's sake, we ask him not to turn away completely, but to let this church be commanded to him, to which God called him, and which God planted through him, and to have his noble dwelling there and to be and remain bishop and father of this church. For he himself could consider from a high intellect what thought it would give to the enemies of the Gospel, who would rejoice that this church, being abandoned, would be held in contempt. On the other hand, that Your Electoral Grace would be highly affected by it. Gn. would be greatly distressed by this, who are otherwise too highly burdened. Thirdly, that in this city and in the entire German nation, many true members of Christ are suffering from many important causes, which Your Electoral Grace should better consider. Gn. himself consider better than we can tell, would bring insurmountable grief to many true members of Christ, since we otherwise truly bear no small burden here. And if this school, in which by God's grace all the laudable arts and necessary languages are now taught more faithfully than perhaps in any other place, should fall apart, this action could well be a beginning. The same envoys should also make this request, if the venerable doctor should be displeased with someone's teaching or life in this university or city, that we all want to help that such displeasure should be stopped. And 


3128 


We must humbly pray that he will not leave the whole church and university for the sake of one or more persons, whoever they are, because God has graciously given him to us, as it is written of Elijah, to be the chariot and leader of Israel, initially and primarily in this church. 

3) Furthermore, as for the courage of the young people, even though we are weak, we are known to be heartily displeased with immorality, and we are willing to maintain discipline and peace as far as our bodies and lives are concerned. God has thus far given grace that the majority of us may be disciplined and study in a praiseworthy manner. We have taken all this into consideration, in submission to Your Lordship. Gn. as our most gracious Lord, who cares for this church and university with all graces and faithfulness. For we do not hold this matter in low esteem, and we ask that Your Electoral Grace will be graciously pleased. We do not regard this matter lightly, and we ask that Your Electoral Grace will graciously consider what should be done, if perhaps Your Electoral Grace can help us. Gn. might graciously require the said doctor to come to the appropriate place and talk to him himself. Your Lordship. Your Lordships know very well that Your Lordships and this church and university are not in agreement. Gn. and this church and university have all too many external enemies, and God is to be asked that our little group remain together. It is said that the late Chancellor of the Emperor, Mercurinus, advised the Emperor to make war on this doctrine, because if it were from God, he would not achieve anything, but if it were not from God, this part would soon disintegrate by itself. Now we know that this teaching is from God. But if the most noble shepherd turns away from this church, there would still be further dispersion to worry about. E. churfirstl. Your Grace may graciously hear our submissive writing, which, according to the importance of this great matter, is much too small. For in addition to the fact that we are to be unskilled, we are truly so highly distressed that we cannot express our grief in words. So we know that Your Electorate is much more deeply concerned about all this. Gn. can think about all this himself much more deeply than we can. 

4 The eternal God preserve His Electoral Grace at all times and govern and maintain this poor church for His glory. Gn. at all times, and govern and preserve this poor church for His glory. Date August 1, 1545.

The pious Elector did not celebrate this letter, but sent to Luther's distinguished advisors and others, and had him graciously summoned to Torgau. And because the university also sent an honest message to him, he allowed himself to be asked and persuaded as a father by his children, and in Wittenberg he finished his last work in Genesin, on which he had worked for ten years with the greatest diligence, on November 17, and concluded with these words: | can no longer, | am weak, orate Deum pro me, pray to God for me, that he may grant me a good and blessed hour.

We give thanks to the eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that out of immeasurable goodness he has established the ministry of the gospel from the creation and restoration of the human race, and has maintained it throughout the ages, until the raising of the dead, and has continually raised up competent teachers, and has commanded his church to appoint competent church ministers, and promises, We pray that he will not let the light of his gospel be extinguished, but will also now raise up champions and faithful guardians of the pure and wholesome teaching of the gospel, and will also now gather a church in these lands, by which he will be praised for all eternity. Since, however, for this service to the Gospel, the most reverend and noble Prince, Lord George, Prince of Anhalt, Count of Ascanien and Lord of Bernburg, Provost of the Church of Magdeburg,

was rightly and godly called to assist in the direction of the ecclesiastical office in the diocese of Merseburg, then, according to the old custom of the first churches, learned and respected men who govern the neighboring churches were called, whose names are written down below, so that in the church of Merseburg itself a public testimony of ordination would be added to this calling. Since we have now been called together, we have, because we had to be sure that this noble Prince George rightly understands and constantly accepts the pure doctrine of the Gospel, which the churches of these lands confess with one voice and in one spirit with the general church of God, and that his virtue and the holiness of his morals are excellent, then we have declared our testimony about him according to apostolic custom by the laying on of hands, and commanded him the office of teaching the gospel and administering the sacraments. And since Paul commanded Titus [Tit. 1, 5.] that he should appoint elders everywhere to teach and govern the churches, this ordained man should know that he is also commanded by the voice of the apostle in this exercise of the office, that he should ordain priests to teach and govern the churches and pay attention to their teaching and their conduct, and that he should be mindful that he is also commanded by your Son of God [Luc. 22:32], "And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." And since the Son of God sits at the right hand of the eternal Father, that he may be effective through this office, we pray that he may govern this ordained man in all his administration, and assist him, as he promised, saying [John 14:23], "He that loveth me shall keep my word, and my Father shall love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." And we exhort the ordained man to sustain himself by this comfort. For even though there are many and great dangers in government, and no human wisdom is equal to such a great burden, he should nevertheless know that God is present in truth and dwells in the Church, where the voice of the Gospel resounds, and that it is defended and preserved by God. In this confidence

The original concept is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. O, p. 147. Litt. fff. Printed by Burkhardt, p. 475. 

Our gracious greeting before. Venerable, respectable and highly respected, dear devotee! It is credible to us that some days ago you went to Zeitz to the venerable, our dear devotee, Ern Niclasen, bishops of Naumburg, which we quite gladly heard for the sake of your health and recreation, although we would have graciously provided for you that you should have made such a planned journey known to us before your departure, so that we could have provided you with a living escort, also food, to move to the place touched and to get through all the more safely. For you know that we did not like to have it done to you before, and that we considered it useful and good, because you know yourselves that Julius Pflug does not cease to strive for the monastery of Naumburg, and to do all kinds of strange practices and substructions with his cousins and friends who sat at the end. And although we do not doubt that the Almighty will let his holy angels wait for you and the churches at your prayer, and guide you in your ways, we nevertheless recognize ourselves guilty of being careful for you with our princely and human assistance. Therefore, we would have graciously and well suffered if you had informed us of your departure beforehand, as we also graciously request that you inform us of your return from Zeitz beforehand, so that we may assign some of our own to you and also have other convenient orders made. 

However, when we arrived at Torgau yesterday, after the date we had set for our main court camp, we were told that you would be in Wittenberg. 


truly heard this in true sorrow and compassion. For if we had noted the causes of your grievances in this, we would not have failed to see and procure for ourselves as much as we could through God's help, so that we could have averted it. Now we have not heard your complaints so far, which is why we do not know how to take care of them, as you yourself, as a person of understanding, can consider. 

However, as we note, there is a rumor and widespread spread of both on the present quay. M. Reichstag at Worms, as well as elsewhere, first of all among those who oppose the divine word and enemies, to their great joy, where such a rumor should press on and on, so we have not refrained from ordering the esteemed, our dear faithful, Matthias Ratzenberger, the doctor of medicine and our personal physician, with this our writing to you, and graciously request you to give him, like ourselves, complete and utter faith in his statement, and to show yourselves ready to do so, as we graciously provide ourselves with this and all good will toward you. In this you do us a particularly gracious favor and we are inclined to you with grace and all good. Date Torgau, Wednesday after Vincula Petri [Aug. 5] 1545.

For we confess that the sun (Solem) is God, since we give it glory like God, namely: Glory to the sun (Gloria sit Soli) or the sun shall have glory like God.

The first, that the cantor, after forbidden company, was_ disobedient, and nevertheless had 2) for and for his usual walk into the house. Secondly, that he at one time stayed together with the shopkeeper in a booth the whole night. Now it would have been fair that punishment had been taken against these offences long ago, and since the cantor then still intended to take the grocer's daughter in marriage, and because of the previous suspicion to worry that such would be a forbidden mixture, you, Mr. Pastor, have done right that you worked on it, so that the wedding would be postponed. For God has forbidden incest and punishes it with great severity, as Moses and many other histories testify. But so that this matter comes to an end, this is our council: that an honorable council of Zwickau actually investigates this article, whether the said cantor has been and stayed in the shopkeeper's house (puden) for one night. And if this has happened, since the suspicion is very strong that he has slept with the shopkeeper, we cannot advise otherwise than that this engagement, which followed, is void, and that honestas publica, [public respectability] moves us not to permit a marriage with the daughter in such suspicion. If, however, it is not found that the cantor has been in the house together with the shopkeeper during the night, and the cantor insists that he has never touched the mother, then, after Christian admonition, the cantor shall be allowed to marry the daughter in Zwickau and live there. We have considered this concern of ours and our council to attribute it to both you, Mr. Pastor, and to an honorable council, and mean that an honorable council should carry out the investigation and inquisition, which know how to keep due measure in this respect.

The students (scholastici) know that it is a disgrace to set examples in the schools that are unworthy of well- meaning people. Above all, however, the studies of the Gospel should be held in honor, for the sake of which God preserves the other arts. 

But on the next 17th day of September the testimony of our college will be publicly announced about the studies and the pDoctor[degree of the highly venerable man M. Peter Hegemon. We therefore call upon all honorable people and those who hold the ministry of the Gospel in honor, that they gather for this announcement of the [Doctor]degree in the usual place, where the young people shall hear learned recollections and with fervent prayers ask of God that He may for His glory govern and protect these our studies of the sciences and the Gospel, and honorable discipline, which are the highest goods of this life, as He graciously promises in Isaiah [Is. 48, 9. 11.]: "For my name's sake and for my glory's sake | will restrain my wrath, that thou be not cut off"; "for my sake, yea, for my sake | will do it, that | be not blaspohemea".

Lorenz Stengel, your city child, has asked for this letter to you, after he has the desire and is sent to study, you want to be beneficial and helpful to him, so that he may have his inherited money, as you know, and use it for the studio, because he feels unfit for the trade, as he complains how his hands are supposed to be frozen. Since his request is honest and praiseworthy, and he can henceforth be used to serve all church offices, | do not know how to deny him such a request. Therefore, my humble, amicable request to you is for the aforementioned Lorenz, to prove to him, as far as possible, favor and support for his Christian endeavors, and, if you have any hesitation in trusting him with such money, you may well deposit it at our university, with instructions as to what should be given to him.

For, the said of Brunswick would not have undertaken to reconquer the same country with the deed in such a way. Since this did not happen, however, and he now has the advantage, regardless of the action decided by the emperor, even of her emperor's harsh and severe penal mandates, he has nevertheless obtained the right to take back the land. Maj.'s harsh and severe penal mandates, he nevertheless has some advantage of his actions, to speak in a human way, to create his will, before one may rise to a substantial resistance against him. And since the Landgrave and we are now in daily preparation of our people for resistance, to which our dear cousin, Duke Moritz of Saxony, is also preparing and showing himself no less friendly with his kind help, we are in comforting hope of God Almighty, to meet him by his divine help in such a way that his conduct shall be broken in a beneficial way, which we graciously hope to receive from you, since without a doubt many a speech will occur to you and 2) to the other scholars of our university. And since all comfort and help from God is to be asked and waited for, and since these actions also have all kinds of strange appearances, whether it might be a prelude and a beginning to further emphasis, which God graciously will turn, after all kinds of dubious practices have been carried out for a while, we 3) quite graciously request that you have us, our country and people in your prayers to God, that he may be the right and supreme warlord in this (thus) his own cause, and that he may control and increase his and his dear son's, our Lord Christ's, and his limbs' enemies and adversaries with earnestness, and that he may not let them prevail in their iniquity and will of courage, nor maintain the pressure, but may strengthen us and all his own with right faith, and also grant correction of our sinful life. We also wish to decree that the people be diligently exhorted and urged to prayer and at the same time to correction, and finally we wish to inform D. Pomerano, Magistro Philippo Melanchthon, D. Creutzinger, Major and others of this letter of ours, according to (still) your concern, as from our command. In our gracious opinion, we have not left this undisclosed to you, as we are inclined to do so with grace and all good. Date Weimar, Saturday after Michaelmas [Oct. 3] 1545.

Grace and peace in the Lord! When | returned from Mansfeld, my dear Augustin, | found your letter at Hanse with the letter from the council at Altenburg, in which you indicate that you also like the preacher at Rochlitz instead of M. Eberhard, and that it is useful that the schoolmaster remains in his position, because of the gift through which he is able to do much in teaching the youth. Since this is the case, what is the need for you to ask me for advice? since it is your office, as a superintendent, to take care of and determine such matters. By the way, if the church at Colditz is vacant, | would like, also for my own sake, that you appoint M. Christoph of Strasbourg there, who was formerly schoolmaster there and is well known to them; he is learned, godly and in every respect a Christian; if a position were vacant, we would under no circumstances let him leave Wittenberg. Yes, we hold council that we may only keep him back because he is the father of about eight children, so that in the meantime he would have something with which he could be maintained. You should answer me as soon as possible. Fare well in Christ. On the day of Calixtus [Oct. 14] 1545.

To the highly venerable man, his brother in Christ, M. Georg Mohr, servant of the Gospel, his extremely dear [friend] in Christ. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | beg you, my dear George, do not be so fainthearted and do not lose heart so quickly. He is still alive and will live forever, who said [Hebr.13,5. Jos.1,5.]: "I will not leave you nor forsake you", whom you have preached for so many years, that he is such and will always be. It is up to you to bear this challenge of faith, so that you may prove what the power of God is. If you suspect that your removal from Naumburg has brought you contempt and danger, you should know that this is not the case. For, as you know, things could not have been advised if you and Medler had not been removed at that time. But as it brought no dishonor to him, so it will bring no dishonor to you. Therefore | want you to think better of us. We do not want you to be abandoned, only you must be patient for a short time until the prince, who is now involved in a difficult war, returns. Then | will either obtain a salary for you, or we will provide you with a position as soon as we can. We will not forget you. For we cannot and will not let the gift of God that is in you and the pound that is given to you be idle or dead. Only be a strong man, and trust in the Lord what you have taught others until now. | send you, as a sign of my love for you and my sincere respect, this small gift, but the great prophet Hosea, explained by my work and the gift of God, so that you may be sure of

We must serve one another according to the teaching of Paul, who was all things to all, Jew to Jew and Gentile to Gentile; otherwise, as soon as he realized that he would be forced to do so as a servant, and that it would have to be done out of necessity, he gave way to no one at all. Therefore it does not take place that you have doubts or that you keep inquiring in this matter. The unity of the spirit, since it belongs to eternal life, is far preferable to these temporal and indifferent things, which come to an end with this life; only that in them we should be of service for a little while out of necessity or for the sake of the brother's weakness, just as we are obliged to serve parents, little children, the weak or the sick. The other you will understand. 

| thank you for the apples you have given us; but at last demand something from us with which we can do you a favor. You fill us with shame by serving us in so many ways for nothing and in an overly pleasing manner. 

But listen: my niece Magdalena, for whose sake | asked you to find out about Ernst's father, the Reuchlin, seems to be enchanted by him, she cannot let go of him. And publicly she says that you wrote wrong what you wrote about his father. So she is listened to against my will.

To the in Christ venerable father and lord, Mr. Nicolaus, the right bishop of the church at Naumburg, his superior and exceedingly gracious lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! We have received the silver coins, venerable Father and Lord, and we all give thanks, both for the gift and for the goodwill. Antonius Musa, 1) as | got to know him in Merseburg, seems to be a good man, who has also recommended himself to us in all things in the best way. He has this fault, however, that he sometimes bursts out with clumsy words. But | believe that he has a sincere mind, therefore it seems to me that this weakness must be borne, in which he is inclined to dispute against those who are younger than he, as if he did not want to suffer being dominated by them. | have no doubt that, admonished by people older than he is, he would yield in all things, as he has also promised me verbally. That is how man is. He has a musical (musicum) head 2c. 

About the Brunswick War, as | have written before, strange rumors are spread. In the beginning he had 2) only 6000 3) foot soldiers without guns (machinis bellicis) and 1200 horsemen. In the meantime the number has grown, so that now it is spread that he has 20,000 men of selected foot soldiers and 2500 horsemen. Of ours we know nothing that they undertake or suffer, except that from a letter D. "Briicken, dated October 6, that the Elector has 9,000 soldiers and 1,300 horsemen under arms, as many as Duke Moritz, as many as the Landgrave, that is 27,000 soldiers and 3,900 horsemen, 4) and that they are still streaming in from all sides. If the cold does not intervene, this war seems to become a Pfaffen war (Pfaffense), with which they have been pregnant for more than 20 years. God finally put the pope to shame. It is not hidden.

Handwritten in Cod. Goth. Printed by Schitze, Vol. |, p. 368 and by De Wette, Vol. V, p. 764. 

Grace and peace! More at another time, now a few words, my dear Jonas. How joyful a victory has God, who hears prayer, given us! O let us only believe and pray. He is true who does the promise. It is an unspeakable and unbelievable thing that is accomplished in such a short time, so suddenly. How saddened are certain people, even many of the nobility, who were quite sure of the victory of their Mezentius 6). O God, keep us this joy, rather this your honor. About the matter and the time all write the same as you, but about the manner and other circumstances the rumors go out of each other. We will receive our letters from the court in a short time. For the Lord Brick wrote nothing on "Wednesday" [Oct. 21], on which the battle took place, except that ours were armed and full of the highest fighting spirit, and it would happen that on "Tuesday" the attack would be made, which happened on "Wednesday". That Mezentius with his son and the Count of Ritburg and WeiBenburg with the nobles were brought to the castle "Zapfenburg" near Cassel, in order to capture them there.

No. 3269. Wittenberg. October 29, 1545. 


To the Elector Johann Friedrich, together with the other theologians. 


Intercession for the town of Helmstadt, which was threatened with harsh punishment by the victorious princes. 


From a copy signed only by Melanchthon in Cod. Rhed. at Breslau and a very old copy in Cod. Goth. 94, p. 229, in Corp. Ref. vol. V, 879. 

To the most illustrious and illustrious, highborn princes and lords, Mr. Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Elector, and Count of Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen and Burgrave of Magdeburg (Meidburgk), and Mr. Philippsen, Landgrave of Hesse, of Katzenelnbogen, Ziegenhain and Dietz, our most gracious and gracious lords, jointly and severally. 


God's grace through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, before. Most Sublime, Most Serene, Most Highborn Prince, Most Gracious and Most Merciful Lord! First of all, we thank Almighty God, Father of our Savior JEsu Christ, for having given good counsel, strength and victory to Your Supreme and Princely Graces in this sudden din, and for having given Your Supreme and Princely Graces person, country and life. Grace person, country and people, churches and regiment to his praise so publicly and graciously. 

1) Just now we see that already Seidemann in De Wette, vol. 


VI, p.457, note 2, has remarked that instead of "17." it should be read: "27." 


1545. no. 3268. 3260. 3153 


We hope that this work will serve as a clear reminder to all people of the fear of God and of right faith. Thus, we also thank Ew. chur. and F. Gn. in good faith that they themselves have shown their seriousness in this and have done their princely work in this, and we ask God that he may also henceforth govern and preserve Ew. chur. and F. Gn. blessedly, as we do not doubt that many God-fearing people ask this with us, who consider how highly and greatly the Christian Church and Lahr are interested that Ew. chur. and F. Gn. Gn. remain in good government. 

But that we now write to Your Highness and Princely Grace, we are moved to do so by a lamentable letter from the poor people of Helmstadt. We are moved to do so by a lamentable letter from the poor people of Helmstadt, who are holding all of us, and who ask us for God's sake to have mercy on them in this extreme peril, and to make a humble and Christian intercession for them. 

They indicate that it is true that they have sent provisions to the enemy and have given fire supplies, but they have done so in order to prevent the enemy from attacking them in the first hurry, since rescue has not yet taken place in the country. 

But that they are further charged as if they should have fallen away from the Gospel, that is not so, but they are always and still willing to commit their life and limb to this Christian doctrine, which Ew. chur. Gn. confess. But since they are now in such terrible misfortune that they are commanded to give 4000 fl. in eight days, or the spot shall be given up to the people of war, they ask and cry out for God's sake that this great wrath may be alleviated. 

Now we ourselves consider that Your Highness and Princely Grace are not angry without great cause that they have strengthened the enemy. Gn. are not angry without great cause that they have strengthened the enemy, even if their minds have not been to fall away from Christian doctrine. We also note that not everyone in the country was equally firm, especially in the first terror, before His Holiness and Princely Grace arrived with the people. Gn. arrived with the people, and there are no doubt many bad boys in the country who have extolled the power of the enemy, inclining the people to him, as many speeches have otherwise sounded in the German country, that it was also said at Nuremberg at the time that Ew. chur. Gu. People would have been slain. 





3154 


But let it be as it may with those thought of in Helmstadt, so we ask for God's sake in all submission, Ew. Ch. and F. Gn. want to show them mercy, accept them again in mercy, and graciously alleviate the great punishment, considering that God has also graciously assisted Ew. Gn. also graciously assisted them, who, although He commanded to punish wanton wickedness, nevertheless He wills that wrath be soothed with mercy, as Christ said: "Blessed are the merciful, for mercy will be shown to them. 

Your Highness and Princely Grace. Your Grace, as wise, noble and practiced princes, know themselves that moderation and kindness are praiseworthy in such times, and pleasing to God, as David also held against Nabal and Simei. Thus it is said that when Pompey won a city in Sicily and wanted to kill the people, one of the noblest in the council asked Pompey why he wanted to punish the poor people, who had been innocent of this outrage, but that he alone was guilty. Because of this confession, Pompey spared him and everyone. 

And although the cost of war is great, that treasury and fines must follow, we ask in courtesy that Your Highness and Princely Grace consider the impossibility of 4000 fl. Gn. will consider the impossibility with the 4000 Fl. The poor country is already highly and miserably afflicted, so that we do not doubt that Your Majesty has mercy and most gracious compassion, as well as remembrance of the poor, scattered and misguided people. They should be an example to other cities and countries to recognize God's wrath in them and to call upon God not to impose similar punishments. Therefore, in submission and for God's sake, we ask that Your Holiness and Your Grace, in honor of God and in consideration of the great suffering of the poor people, show mercy to these afflicted people of Helmstadt. God will undoubtedly reward them mildly. Thus, some God-fearing people will recognize this mercy and ask God for His Grace. 

In this way, our prayer, which we do daily with all our hearts for the sake of Our Lord and Savior, will be all the more joyful to God, the eternal Father of our children.

First, about the matter of the abbot in Posen who wanted to marry. Then about the letter of Cordatus (No. 3268).

To the most reverend father and lord in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus, the right bishop of the church at Naumburg, his superior to be highly honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in the Lord! | have written about the Abbot of Poznan, Reverend Father in Christ, in order to fulfill my promise. | do not ask and do not desire that anything else happen than what you write. 

| am sending you a letter from Cordatus, from which you will see what | very eagerly believe. For for some days | had been doubting in my heart that there might be some secret agreement between Mezentius and ours; so | interpreted this sudden transfer. But Cordatus, through this letter, has put this contestation to rest. But | wonder why they [the papists] so conceal this honor of God, by which he wanted to make himself known. Do they perhaps seek a future, other, even greater defeat and disgrace? At court one learns nothing, not even from the prince himself. Therefore, | ask you to get involved in gathering information wherever you can 1). For you dwell among the enemies of the prince and the friends of the me

But they make a fairy tale out of this matter. But | believe that our Lord has not yet experienced such a thing (audisse). 2) For God uses to frighten the enemies in such a way. But they want to hide their shame, as you see. Fare well in your Lord, venerable father. November 5, 1545.

To the reverend Father and Lord in Christ, Mr. Nicolaus, the right and faithful bishop of the church at Naumburg, his superior who is highly honored in the Lord. 


Grace and peace in the Lord. Reverend Father in Christ and Lord! | think | remember that when | was in Zeitz, the Abbot of Posen asked something, namely (as | think) that he would not be deprived of the administration of the monastery if he took a wife, and that he had received consolation. Then, M. Georg ‘Mohr was here with me, sighing and complaining that he still had no position; | gave him a letter to the prince to obtain some alms. But for the abbot's sake | have been asked to write to your reverence and ask that he, now that he is old and well deserving of the monastery, keep the administration for life. He is said to be a very useful and faithful steward, and it seems unreasonable if he were to be cast out, since he cannot live long. If he marries, then he may have a reason, for it cannot be for pleasure. | suspect that loneliness moves him, but God grant that he is not mistaken, amen. 

It is something wonderful, and what | would not have believed, the hatred of your Meissner against 


3158 


Therefore | like more and more every day the prince's counsel, according to which he wanted you to be bishop in this place against the plow, so that the sinner would see it and be angry, gnash his teeth and harden himself, and the desire of the wicked would be destroyed. "Surely it is now come to pass, the devil is enraged." For even if we said to that peasant with uplifted 1) hands, "You are my gracious lord the devil," he would not become a hair's breadth kinder. May the Lord, who started it, also carry it out, amen. 

In this hour "He Hans Schotte" was with me, who ordered two sons to our school; he told me that in the city of Hassfurt 2) there had been a certain pope, who had preached in this way: "Now help me to ask God, that H. at Brunswick may lie. If it lies above, then one will give three dukes for a penny; if it lies below, then one will give fourteen priests for a heller." But you may have heard this long ago.

The church in Helmstadt is now even more destroyed by this misery, even though previously, for three years after the first conquest of the land of Brunswick, a pastor in Helmstadt never received the prescribed salary and provision. For although |, Doctor Joannes Bugenhagen, Pomeranus, the time required to establish church order in the Principality of Brunswick, have determined a fair salary, with indication in which places the same is to be taken, this faithful and Christian order has never been put into practice, of which complaint often reaches E. C. F. G., and to some extent they regard this matter as if the governors at Wolfenbittel were a little harder on them for the very reason that they are sued for it. Should this gracious victory result in the destruction of the parishes and schools, we would be very sorry, as we have been informed that the schoolmaster can no longer remain, and he is still owed some previously earned salary. For this reason, we ask once again, for God's sake, that His Holiness show mercy to the poor people and, in addition to alleviating the punishment, command to God's honor that the parish and school be maintained according to the established order.

We do not consider this as a sentence or judgment, but we think that it would be most convenient to bring this matter to an end in this way. And first of all we say that the worthy pastor had reason to plead the offense, because incesta consuetudo is such a cruel sin that one should not only avoid the offense, but also the suspicion and suspicion. For this reason, pastors and councilors are obliged to be more careful in such matters than in others, and the pastor should remain unchallenged on account of the plea. Secondly, although the witnesses do not say that the deed was done, and the persons are somewhat excused, therefore we cannot condemn them, nevertheless a suspicion remains, and both persons have done wrong in that the cantor, as a drunkard, lies down there in the booth (puden) and stays there until night, and that the woman allows such, goes in once and the other time; all this is annoying, although nothing else has happened. Therefore, one E. R[ath] shall demand of the cantor and give him this reproof: that he will consider God's judgment, that incesta consuetudo is a particularly terrible sin, which God punishes not only on the perpetrators, but also on the whole cities, as God speaks Levitici 18 and Amos 2. Therefore, if he, the cantor, knows himself guilty, then there is no marriage, nor will there ever be a marriage between them, and he shall refrain from these sponsalibus altogether. And he shall be clearly told to keep his conscience before God, and not to give this answer: he should be sent away; but he shall do for his conscience what is right. But if he insists that he is innocent, we cannot prevent this marriage with the virgin, but let him be free on his conscience. But since St. Paul says, ab omni specie mala, abstinete, and especially these are things in which not only the deed but also suspicion should be avoided, our concern is that the cantor should not solemnize and hold the wedding in Zwickau, but in other places; he should also immediately live in other places and not in Zwickau; but "he" should not be forbidden the city with this. Nor shall the cantor and the other people consider this objection unreasonable, as though they had

quite deserves no punishment, because the annoyance is criminal. A virtuous woman should be more careful than to suffer such full, disorderly people around her. The cantor has also done wrong by causing such trouble. The world is wild and does not want to suffer restraint and discipline. According to this, we pastors should keep silent about all ailments; that is no good either. Therefore, the cantor takes this punishment upon himself, as an example to others, that other companions and wives avoid trouble more diligently, in honor of God and for the good of us all. And no person shall be injured in his honor, for this is a church punishment and fatherly discipline. Martinus Luther, D. Johannes Bugenhagen, Caspar Creniziger, D. Georgius Major, D.

G. and the landgrave, because of the touched armor and weapons, asked his honorable father if he wanted to leave the same few words outside, and nevertheless put the meaning together again, with the request that the awarded 3) quatrains should be refunded to the printer. But he became angry and whimsical, and said that he would not do it for a short time, and that if he were to be caught, he would have to let such letters go. And although | did not dare to send for the copy and see if anything else might be in it that might cause concern until the end of the emperor's life, | did have the book printer confidentially asked about it. He let me know that it was only a quatern, as E, and noted nothing in it that might have the emperor's half complaint or concern. Therefore, | will leave it at that, because it is nevertheless a necessary, beautiful and amusing booklet, and basically such an argument that it will nevertheless attract many people. | did not want to leave this undisclosed to Your Lordship in subservience, and | am also ready and willing to serve them with my subservient property in all ways.

"To the worthy Mr. Schulzen, pastor of Belgern, my favorable good friend." Prayer and peace in the Lord and Jesus Christ. Reverend Pastor! "The castle of Torgau and the council of Belgern have written to me, asking me to give good counsel and comfort to Mrs. Hans Kornerin, so that her husband may be helped. Now I truly know of no worldly consolation, and where doctors do not know how to help, it is certainly not a "bad melancholy,” but rather a challenge from the devil, which must be confronted in the power of Christ with the prayer of faith. This is what we do and what we are used to doing. For there was a box maker here who was so seized with madness that we healed him through prayer in Christ. Therefore you should do this: Go to him with the chaplain and two or three good men, and you, with certain confidence that you are in the public church office and the pastor in the place, lay your hands on him and say: Peace be with you, dear brother, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. After that you shall pray the holy Christian faith and the Lord's Prayer over him with an audible voice, and conclude with these words: GOD, Almighty Father, who said to us by thy Son [Jn. 16, 23.], "Verily, verily, | say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it you"; and again [v. 24.] thou hast commanded and compelled to pray in his name, "Ask, and ye shall receive"; likewise Ps.50, 15: "Call upon me in time of trouble, and | will save you, and you shall praise me."

This you shall do three times, once in one day, while prayers are nevertheless held publicly in the church in the pulpit, until God hears.

how it is to be acted upon at the Diet other than by petition. Our order does not extend further than that the preachers, each in his profession, preach rightly, and that the superiors, each in his place, help to protect and promote the right preaching ministry, and maintain outward honest discipline. But to reach into foreign principalities and to wage war is not for us to advise. 

From this follows from the other article, from the Universal Reformation, that we also know no other reformation to pretend, except that we admonish that all potentates in their territories establish pure Christian doctrine and the right use of the sacraments, and faithfully appoint the preachers’ chairs and necessary offices, and put away abuses, according to our confession. But that some pretend that one should think of a new reformation, and give way much, this we do not understand differently, than that we should depart from our doctrine and confession, and mix both doctrines (Lahr), papal and others, into one. This would cause a new disruption and destruction of our churches. And perhaps some want to bring into this new reformation also many worldly things, such as the distribution of the monasteries and bishoprics 2c. With such a reformation, if one wants to expel the bishops, one will not move them to accept correct doctrine. Nor do we hope that separation will occur between princes or estates of this part, that one or more will undertake such a mixed reformation and force it into the world. But if this were to happen out of God's wrath, which God would mercifully prevent, then many and various new divisions would arise in the German lands, but we do not want to advise this, nor do we hope that anyone would have the desire to do so. 

But that some say against it that one cannot change everything suddenly in the papal churches, to this our answer is: The doctrine should remain pure, although one should have patience with those who are slow in abolishing abuses and establishing better order, even if inequality remains in external unnecessary things. Every man of understanding can see for himself how dreadful a mistake it would be if each one were to invent a new doctrine of his own. Therefore, we are to pray to God 


We ask you to keep us in the right doctrine, and we should not be foolish in teaching and reformation of any kind. 

As the report also comes from the chamber court, this is entirely a secular matter and does not belong in our council.

To the reverend Father in Christ and Lord, Mr. Nicolaus, your right bishop of the church at Naumburg, his superior who is especially to be honored in the Lord. 

Grace and peace in Christ! Since Mr. Philippus, Creuziger and Major are absent, we two, Pommer and |, are obliged to answer Your Grace, Reverend Father in the Lord. First of all, it is not negligence, but malice, and indeed an extraordinary malice of this deacon, 1) who, as a despiser of God and of men, has dared to consider publicly consecrated hosts and unconsecrated ones to be the same. Therefore, he must be expelled from our churches; he should go to his Zwinglians. It is not necessary that the man who Ss

The chaplain testified that he had done this out of embarrassment, since he had suddenly run out of blessed bread and the missing host had fallen to the ground. The bishop sat down

not belonging to us, is held captive, to whom nothing must be believed, even if he swears. Furthermore, the one who received the unconsecrated host did not sin; his faith made him blessed, believing that he was receiving the right sacrament and relying on the word of God. But he is not deceived, just as he is baptized who believes, even if the baptizer had played a game, or had baptized with a different liquid. But on this occasion it is not necessary to dispute so sharply, lest simple-minded consciences be troubled or irritated. It is enough that everything is possible for him who believes. It is well done with the mixed particles that they are burned, although it would not have been necessary to burn them, since nothing is a sacrament outside its use, as the water of baptism is not a baptism outside its use. In those who eat and believe, Christ works in the sacrament. But for the sake of the aversion, the priest was right in burning. 

Besides, | have nothing in the way of news. Yesterday, Mr. Philippus left for Torgau, summoned by the prince, to see if he had to go to the colloquium in Regensburg. | advised the prince with all my strength not to send Philippus, who is dangerously ill, to such a useless, futile, meaningless colloquium, in which they only ridicule us and waste time and expense.

Concerns about the Rathschlag of the Strasbourg theologians about the colloquium at Regensburg, together with the other theologians. 


From the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 663, N. 203 (by Cruciger's hand with original signatures), printed by Burkhardt, p. 487. 


All the Strasbourg writing, whether to propose a new form of the Colloquii from our part, if it would be carried out by the Emperor and his own unequally and unfruitfully, this is our submissive concern. First of all, after the occasion of this time, we consider that no colloquium will be held at all, especially if we do not insist on it, as we consider it good that we keep quiet about it, if the emperor does not do so. For this colloquium is set up solely for a pretense that the one from Brunswick would have room to prepare in the meantime 2c. Thus the emperor knows that ours are easily satisfied with the sweet name of the Colloquii. He will also perhaps make all kinds of inquiries about the prisoner among the princes and chieftains of this part. In addition, it is known that King Ferdinand is fiercely holding out for the Turk, and considers it certain that he [the Turk] will arrive next summer. On the other hand, in the event that a colloquium is to be started immediately, if the emperor orders his theologians from Cologne and Louvain to do so, it will be a short disputation, and will soon clash in such rough articles that we will rise from them with great gloating with an earnest Christian protestation, in which their gross obstinacy against public truth will be denounced. And whoever has been in such matters before, can well be sure that this will soon happen in the first articles, as of original sin and justification. For the theologians of Louvain will also dispute the article de justificatione anew. ltem, so one comes soon in the beginning on the article of the church and authority of the Concilien, there they leave nothing. On the other hand, this is not to be conceded in any way, that the churches may not err, as was also the case at Regensburg. 


3182 


argued for eight days. And since we wanted to overturn the disputation, and they could not pass it, they needed this rank to suspend this article, and nevertheless took the others, in which it soon became even harder, from confession and sacrament apart from the custom. And in sum, it is not difficult to overturn the disputation with gusto, if one wants to show seriousness. And then one can make a written protest, in which one shows how the opposing party wants to defend the inconsistent and crude articles. Thirdly. But that we should afterwards propose a new form of a colloquy is a futile thing, for as little as we can like them as judges, as little do they like us; so we cannot propose persons whom they consider to be impartial, just as their persons are all suspicious to us. Whether someone in Strasbourg may be inclined to another colloquium, we know well that Ulm and other cities will be quite unwilling to do so. So our gracious lord, the Landgrave, knows which articles the opposing party disputes the most, therefore H. F. G. will not be in the mood for it. Therefore we consider that it would be good that our gracious lord, the Landgrave, writes to those of Strasbourg that S. F. G. considers it a futile thing that we should propose a form of a Colloquii, therefore it would be better to leave it at the previous concern. Nor should we worry so much about the concilium, for the pope himself does not suffer a concilium about it; even if a supposed concilium would conclude something, there will be such rough articles in it that it will be too late. But everything is in God's hand, who wants to guide the hearts of all rulers and teachers to His praise and the blessedness of Christendom, Amen. E. C. F. G. subject Martinus Luther, D.

It is said that the emperor is pressing for the Trent Concilium and has many other things in mind. Whether this is null and void or not, | have no interest in it. In the Netherlands, the missal priests and the monks are unwilling and impatiently grumble against God, because he has suffered Mezentius to be defeated and captured, although they have offered so many thousands of masses every day throughout their country for his welfare. They therefore complain to God why He despised His faithful and holy servants and so many masses by which they would not have doubted to gain the victory against us heretics. They are surprised that the glory of the masses

The guardians have therefore asked us to request the poor orphans against E. C. F.

G. that E. C. F. G. want the poor orphans, whose father and mother both died within a fortnight of each other and left them little else, to have such two fiefs income for the three years, as the prescriptions read, follow gracious order, so that they may remain unhampered by the rulers of the common treasury at Torgau until the end of the three years, that also such income by Johann Walter, cantor at Torgau, as with Mr. Pauli's life, may be admonished and handed over to the children for their good.

Grace and peace in the Lord. Dear Kathe! We arrived in Halle today at eight o'clock, but did not go to Eisleben, because we encountered a great flood with waves of water and large ice floes that covered the land, which caused us to be baptized again. So we could not return because of the Mulda, and had to lie still between the waters in Halle, not that we thirsted to drink, but took good Torgian beer and good Rhenish wine for it, with which we refreshed and comforted ourselves in the meantime, whether the Saala wanted to go out again. For because the people and wagoners, and we ourselves, were timid, we did not want to go into the water and tempt God; for the devil is angry with us, and dwells in the water, and is better kept than lamented, and is without need that we should make the pope and his scales a fool's delight. | would not have thought that the Saala could make such a sod that it should rumble over stone paths and everything like that. Now no more, then: Pray for us and be pious. | think that if you had been here, you would have advised us to do the same, and we would have followed your advice. Hereby God be praised, amen.

From a copy in the Wolf Collection of the Hamburg City Library, vol. 66, lol. 3, printed in Kolde, Analecta, p. 425. 

To the reverend and highly learned men, Mr. Martin Luther, Mr. Johann Bugenhagen, Mr. Caspar Cruciger, Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, doctors of sacred theology, his fathers and teachers who are to be highly honored with all reverence. 

Hail! We arrived in Regensburg on January 21, not without difficulty, because it was so bitterly cold and there was heavy snow everywhere. Immediately, the next day, we announced our arrival to the presidents, the Bishop of Eichstadt and Count Friedrich von Furstenberg. After breakfast on the same day, they called some of us to them, and first announced in a peevish manner that the colloquium had been postponed until now because not everyone had come together, and then it was decided that the day for the beginning of the colloquium should be January 27. 1) What the manner of the colloquium will be, and on what the disputation will take place, we do not yet know at all. But because the Concilium at Trent was again proclaimed with great pomp, many think that the disputation will be about the prestige of the Concilium and the pope, so that if we do not want to recognize the same, the sentence against us will be passed in the Concilium, which the emperor will have to execute afterwards. For Veit [Dietrich] writes, who, we hope, will attend our meeting today with Herr Hieronymus Baumgartner, that attempts are being made on our heads, so that some think that this year will be a ruinous one for Germany. But God will still be the protector of those who hope in Him, against this rage of Satan and the world, who will not allow the Church and the teachings brought to light to be destroyed. There is a profound silence here about the arrival of the emperor and the future imperial diet. The meeting with our theologians has strengthened me very much, because | see that they are good, godly and learned men. Therefore, | ask Your Honor to command us in your prayers, that he may govern and guide our actions so that they may be beneficial for the Church. We wanted to send the wagoner back to Torgau again, but because of the melted

Because of the snow and the downpours, all the rivers everywhere were so worn out that it was not safe to make the journey. Therefore, there was no messenger that | could have sent. Yesterday, January 27, the Colloquium began. The presidents have admonished that we should discuss the statements of the Scriptures without any bitterness of the minds. But | am sending here the form of the Colloquium which has been proposed in the name of the Emperor, and in my name and in the name of all of us who are here (for | have been instructed to ask this of Your Honor), | ask that you help us with your counsel and with your prayers. For it is said that our opponents are quite impudent and dishonest people, with whom there will be a colloquium, but no harmony. We have spent today with the election of notaries 1) and other preparations; what will happen afterwards, | will write. May God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, keep us and His Church.

Count Albrecht, who has all the borders around Eisleben, has abandoned the Jews who have seized his property. Still no one wants to do anything to them.

But | let myself be heard today, where one wanted to notice what my opinion was, crudely enough, if it should help otherwise. Pray, pray, pray and help us to do well. For today | had in mind to grease the wagon in ira mea; but the misfortune, so it happened to me, of my fatherland kept me. | have now also become a lawyer. But it will not prosper them.

F. G.'s high intellect, more is not necessary.

The king of England was an unholy husband, therefore his example shall always be exemplified.

From Reg. LI, p. 77. n. 61. 1. Printed from a copy in Burkhardt, p. 491. 

Our greeting before. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have recently been informed by the also venerable Mr. Niclasen, bishop of Naumburg, our dear devotee, the same also from our office in Weida, of a case that occurred with the chaplain in Frisnitz. Although we have now been informed by the said bishop of the form in which you and D. Pomeranus have attributed your concerns 1) to him, and have also received a copy of such concerns, we have nevertheless, for moving reasons, not wanted to refrain from ordering that further inquiries be made about these matters, that the chaplain be held to this, that his answer be diligently marked, and then sent to you, and that your further concerns be noted therein. Since such interrogation has now taken place, and the chaplain has also submitted his responsibility in writing, and has been sent to us by the bishop, we hereby send it to you. And since we note that the bishop, after the answer of the captain has been given, intends to direct the matters of the punishment to an alleviation, as you can judge from his writing, and we do not want to procure or conclude anything in this regard without your advice and concern, our gracious request is that you open the same to us and make it known, so that we may have to respond to it with further orders. You have our favorable opinion, and we are graciously inclined to you. Date Torgau, Wednesday after Dorothea [10 Feb.] 1546.

George Major to Luther and the other theologians. 


Major reports on the beginning of the Regensburg colloquium, namely on the article of justification, on Bucer's diligence and skill, on the colloquists of the opposing party, and on the probable fruitlessness of the conversation. 


The original is in the Weimar Archives, Reg. H, fol. 653, no. 203. Printed in Corp. Ref. vol. VI, 38. 


To the highly famous and highly learned men, Mr. Martin Luther, Mr. Johann Bugenhagen, Mr. Caspar Cruciger, Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, Doctors of Theology, his exceedingly revered fathers and teachers. 

Hail in Christ Jesus! What has been going on here in the past few days, venerable gentlemen and teachers of high esteem, | believe, Your Honor has sufficiently recognized from our letters. Several days were spent with the well-known insignificant matters, such as the admission of notaries, their number, their reliability, the safekeeping of acts, and that they should not be spread, and many other such things more. After that they came to the matter itself. Then the Spaniard Malvenda, the collocutor sent in the name of the emperor, began to dictate to the notaries from a letter the act, the brief epitome of which | send here. The next day Bucer answered in our name, and this day was spent with the refutation of his [Malvenda's] preface and the discussion of that with which he had tormented us and our princes, and after that the protestation 1) written by me, which we sent to you the other day, was read out. Although nothing harsh was said in it against the emperor or anyone else, the opponents nevertheless began to cry out that it was not a protestation but an accusation (criminationem). And Malvenda said: Since the emperor is mentioned here, and | am an imperial official (Caesareanus), | will not suffer them to continue before | have answered each piece. Moved by the emperor's prestige, the

Presidents to resign; but after the protest had been more carefully considered, we were again called, and the Presidents requested that we proceed. 

Then, among other things, two in particular were carefully discussed. Firstly, since we saw that the opponents were intent on leading us away to Sorbonian sophisms by leaving out the way prescribed by the Emperor for dealing with the fourth article of the Augsburg Confession, justification, we indicated that we did not want to deal with them about this article in any other way than according to the Augsburg Confession, as commanded by the Emperor. Then it is diligently proved to them from the acts of the colloquium, which was held here before, that this article of justification was agreed upon and accepted, also according to the testimony of the opponents themselves and of the emperor. Then, according to the order, every single thing that belongs to the doctrine has been treated with the greatest fidelity and care, as you will read the epitome of this action that the Lord Brenz sent, because he also wanted to earn some thanks. Bucer is very suitable 


preparatory] for these actions, and although the rest of us carefully 


observe all his sayings, writings, and actions, he has truly handled this matter with the greatest fidelity so far, as the acts show. And to all of you he always makes honorable mention as his fathers and teachers, does nothing without first consulting us, he hears our advice and obeys it. For we consult with each other almost daily, and there is nothing more pleasant for me here than the coming together and confidential contact with the best and most learned men, who, as | see, love you all with all their hearts. The adversaries, as the seed of the serpent, find quite unlike a man, the utmost yeast of the sophists; the two monks are exceedingly insolent men. Malvenda, after the manner of his people, is a very hopeful man, puffed up by the emperor's prestige; he tries to disturb everything, and even the presidents, who are otherwise quite fair to us, are nevertheless compelled to fear him, and both have made it clear to us that they hate this Spaniard; we, however, despise his defiance and his hopefulness, and several times we have frustrated his foolish attempts. It is pleasant for Cochlaus to hang at the back of the collocutors. 


3202 


What the beginners’ colloquiums are, and what reconciliation with the adversaries can be hoped for, Your Honor will understand and recognize more fully from the letter to the most noble Prince. Therefore, you will have to advise and inform us whether it is possible to continue with the opponents in the remaining articles of our Confession as prescribed by the Emperor, since | do not see that there is any hope that they will give in on anything. For this your counsel we all ask and desire. Fare well, most esteemed fathers and teachers, whom Christ may long preserve to His Church. Regensburg, February 10, 1546.

Grace and peace in the Lord. Dear Kathe! We hope to come home again this week, if God wills. God has shown great mercy here; for the lords have settled almost everything through their councils, except for two articles or three, among which is that the two brothers Count Gebhard and Count Albrecht will become brothers again, which | am to do today, and | will ask them to come to me as guests, so that they may also talk to each other; for they have been silent until now, and have embittered themselves severely with writings. Otherwise, the young gentlemen are cheerful, ride together with the jester-Glécklin on sleighs, and the Fraulin too, and bring each other Mumschenz, 2) and are good things, even Count Gebhard's son. So one must grasp that God is exauditor precum [the hearer of prayers].

of unity. Your sons are still at Mansfeld. Jakob Luther wants to provide for them.

Jonas' leg would have been almost quad 1), so it has gained holes on the shin; but God will also help. 

You may report all this to M. Philipps, D. Pomer and D. Creuziger. There is a rumor that D. Martinus has been taken away, as they say in Leipzig and Magdeburg. The wise men, your compatriots, invent such things. Some say that the emperor is thirty miles away from here at Soest in Westphalia; some that the Frenchman accepts servants, the landgrave too. But let us say and sing; we will wait and see what God will do. Hereby commanded by God. At Eisleben on Sunday Valentini [14 Feb.] 1546.

The other servants, as a capellan, a cantor, two chorales, four boys and the sexton, are to be accepted by the decanus and to be

have to govern. However, as far as the chaplain and sexton are concerned, any person shall be accepted with the consent of the lords and in the presence of their officials. 

The chaplain shall perform the sacraments and see to it that the ceremonies are properly performed. The other persons know what they should do. 

The two chorales and four boys shall live at the school and be kept there under the supervision of the schoolmaster. And the two chorales shall each help to read two hours a day in the school, for which the schoolmaster needs them. 

The parish priest in the valley is to be accepted by the common lordship; and since this parish has no more than 52 guilders in income, our gracious lords want to give 100 guilders annually in honor of God and at the intercession of both of us, D. Martini and D. Jona. Jona, annually 100 florins for the maintenance of a priest, and with such alms serve Christ for his kingdom. On the other hand, the people of Mansfeld shall lend the house in the churchyard, where the dean is now, to the deanery, and let their pastor, preacher and chaplain live in the other three houses next to it. And so that unity is kept in both churches, the dean shall take care that, as acommon church order made by the venerable D. Martino, the same is kept properly. However, the dean, pastor and other servants shall be subject to the superintendent at Eisleben. 


The school in the Mansfeld valley. 

For this purpose, our gracious lords have given about one prebend, and now ordered for it: fifteen florins Count Gebhart, fifteen florins Count Albrecht, forty florins the young lords. And it is the request of the doctors that J. J. G. G. want such money to remain at the school, and that it be ordered to be given to the quarters. 


Salary of the persons, the servants at the castle. 


Two hundred florins, fifteen bushels of wheat, fifteen bushels of rye, fifteen bushels of barley, five ounces of wood to the dean.

Summa in money 506 guilders. 

The total amount that all the persons have to maintain makes 568 guilders, 9 groschen on the castle. 


The contract was signed by both doctors after prior consultation, and approved and executed by all the Counts of Mansfeld. 

| Martinus Luther, Doctor of the Holy Scriptures, announce with this open letter that the well-born and noble gentlemen, Mr. Gebhart, Mr. Albrecht, Mr. Philipps, and Mr. Hans George, brothers and cousins, Counts and Lords of Mansfeld 2c., and next reported both counts, for themselves and J. Gn. young and underage brothers, on my, also the venerable, my dear friend, D. Jona, cultivated interlocution, in honor of God, and for the promotion of common benefit, the following articles, order half of the churches, schools, hospitals, matrimonial matters and the ecclesiastical ban, have finally and amicably compared with each other. 

Namely, J. G. shall and want to maintain the most distinguished person in the church at Eisleben St. Andrea, who shall be pastor and superintendent, and who shall be appointed and accepted by well-reported 2) counts, I. G. heirs and descendants. The same superintendent shall be paid five hundred florins annually, so that he may be well and prosperously maintained. He shall also have the building, where the St. Andrea school used to be, together with the house in which Mr. Clemen currently lives, prepared and built, so that he can maintain himself well and in good standing. Count Albrecht will pay two fifths and the other counts three fifths of the building costs. But the other persons in the church St. Andrea,

outside the school persons, shall have to appoint count Philipps and count Hans George. Count Albrecht, however, shall appoint all persons in St. Niclas and Peter Parish Churches as patrons. The same Superattenden shall take care of all parish priests and prebendaries of this county doctrine and customs, shall require them, and shall address and punish them in the presence of assigned persons. And in case they do not want to be obedient, they are to be reported to the lord under whom they sat and urged by him to Christian and due obedience. 

Also the disputed matrimonial matters in the whole dominion shall be brought before this superintendent, who shall then require the assigned ones, as often as a matrimonial matter will arise, also to write to the count, if the matters concern the common dominion, or however one all alone competent subjects, then J. G. shall then write to the count, if it concerns common subjects. G. shall then, if it concerns common subjects, send their entire council, or, if it concerns a count's subjects alone, then the same count shall send his council to such action. If, however, J. G. would not send all his councilors, if it concerned the subjects of the common lordship, or one of them, if it concerned J. G. of one of the subjects, the superintendent shall nevertheless, in addition to those assigned to him, dispose of the equity according to divine rights and ordinances. 

For the sake of the schools, it is agreed that the two schools, which J. G. kept hard by St. Andre's churches, shall be combined: so that there shall be a noble Latin school here in Eisleben, which J. G. will maintain in good order. will give the schoolmaster 200 florins, the other after him 100 florins, the third 90 florins, the fourth 80 florins, the fifth 50 florins and the sixth 40 florins, the seventh also 40 florins, and the eighth 30 florins. 

J.G. shall also have to dismiss the same school persons in case of need and to accept them anew. 

The superintendent and the school personnel will receive 1130 florins, of which Count Albrechten will receive 452 florins on two fifths, and the other counts 678 florins on three fifths. 


3208

Such sums shall be divided by those ordered to do so, each quarter the fourth part, to each person according to his or her number. And on all holidays, or when preaching takes place, both churches, St. Andrea and Nicolai, shall be supplied with collaborators and pupils from this combined school. But the children's school at St. Peter's in the city of Eisleben shall nevertheless remain. 

It has been agreed that the houses that have now been brought to churches and schools, which belong to whichever lord they wish, shall remain with the schools and churches. 

Settlement of the Dechanei on the Castle and the Parish in the Mansfeld Valley: is agreed, negotiated and agreed by both counts, that the contract, which was recently established, which states that count Hoier and his young cousins are to lend the deanery, count Gebhart and Albrecht are to lend the parish in the valley from now on, shall be null and void in this point, so that from now on the deanery on the castle and the parish in the valley are to go to the fief of all counts. And after there were five fiefs in the church at the castle outside the dechantry, which were divided, so that each lord was given one fief to lend: so now the use of these five fiefs, such as the dean, chaplain, choir master, choir pupils, organist, four boys and sexton for maintenance and reward, shall be used for the maintenance of the dechant and the church people at the castle. Namely, the dean has been ordered to receive 200 florins annually from now on. The same dean is to take on a chaplain, who is also sent to preach, as well as the choirmaster, and the two choir students and four boys, but all with the advice of the counts, officials or commanders. 

The dean shall also preach on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays when he can do so in his body; the chaplain shall perform the sacraments, and on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays he shall give a German lesson from Luther's sermons, and shall have 100 florins annually for his salary. The cantor, in addition to the two chorales, shall maintain the church and singing diligently. And the cantor shall be paid 40 guilders, and each chorister 32 guilders. 





The chorales, however, shall be obliged to read every day for two hours in the school in the valley and to help where the schoolmaster needs them. In addition, four boys are to be kept to help with the singing: each of them is to receive 8 guilders annually and a skirt on Michaelmas. The sexton shall be paid 30 guilders and the organist 40 guilders annually. Thus, the amount that goes to the deanery and church servants of the castle is 506 florins, not including the clothing of the four boys. 

Now that there are no more, as recorded in the inheritance register above, the reported Counts want to arrange that which is lacking, namely Count Albrecht two fifths, and the other Counts, as Count Philipps and Count Hans Georg together with J. G. brothers, three fifths of certain pensions. G. brothers, will arrange three fifths of certain annuities, and thus procure that such 506 1) florins, with that which is already available, will be made payable and will certainly be payable at Easter. 

And because Count Albrecht let the income of the fief, which was called the fourteen emergency helpers, and which was his responsibility, follow the council of Heckstadt for a while, he wants to make such income again valid, or insure another end. However, as far as the parish is concerned, since the same, as the citizens of the Mansfeld Valley give little for its maintenance, does not have an income of more than 52 guilders, 2) the citizens shall be talked to in such a way that the parish priest will have at least one and a half hundred guilders. And if the counts could not provide him with such from the community, what is then lacking, the counts shall reimburse and provide that the priest shall have one and a half hundred florins. The dean, however, shall have and keep his dwelling in the churchyard, where the present dean, Mr. Michael, is inside. And in the three houses next to it shall live pastor, preacher and chaplain, as they have been assigned. And so that unity is kept in both churches, the dean shall take care that, as a common church order, made by me D. Martino, the same

be kept in an orderly manner. However, the dean, pastor and other servants shall be subject to the superintendent at Eisleben. 

In order that the school at Mansfeld may be maintained in a more stately manner, the Counts intend to give 15 florins from each fifth for the board, as it has been used until now, and to make sure that the end, when the maintenance of the others is decreed, is received and provided for. 

The two hospitals in Eisleben, the Holy Spirit and St. Catharina, are to be combined with all benefits and staffing, but the healthy are to be separated in different chambers from the unclean and infirm. And J. G. want to order eight persons from their noble citizens, who are most in service, together with a hospital master, to preside over the poor people most faithfully, and to provide for them, also to make the light slate, such as all that which the hospitals in Erfurt and other ends have outstanding, operational again. If it were also a matter of the hospital's land or anything else being stolen, the J. G. would want it to be brought back. 

As far as matrimonial matters and degrees, as well as the ecclesiastical ban, are concerned, J. G., together with their councilors, superintendents, and guards, want to establish a Christian order in the county, and then have it established and publicized according to Christ's word and order. 

In witness and constant, firm attitude, the Counts have promised for themselves, J. G. heirs, young brothers and descendants, to keep this act unbreakable to us, D. Martins Luthero and D. Justo Jona. Justo Jona, whereupon we now reported, and both Doctores, this treaty and grant twofold, affirmed with our attached petitions, signed with our own hand, assigned the one to Count Albrechten, and the other to the 1) other Counts.

From a copy in Cod. Monac. 90, no. VII, p. 197, in Corp. Ref. vol. VI, 52. 


To the highly famous restorer of godly doctrine, D. Martin Luther, his lord and patron to be revered in Christ. 

Hail in Christ! Although, venerable father, D. George Major writes to you in detail what we suffer here in our assembly in truth more than what we do, | have nevertheless, because we do not doubt that you unite your prayers with ours, wanted to unite with his letter also mine to your reverence. 

There are different opinions about our action. But | believe that it is a clear example of the success of human counsel. For this colloquium is scheduled to be a preparation for establishing harmony in the ecclesiastical disputes. The collocutors of the opposing party seem to intend not only to preserve that ungodly doctrine which has a certain appearance of godliness, but also to restore that which was previously rejected by the more reasonable of their own party. They give us eulogies on the scholastic teachers and theologians. They teach that the ungodly can prepare themselves by good works to receive the grace by which they are justified. They say that in the Church of Christ it is commanded that there should be a twofold righteousness, of faith and of works. They preach to us that they consider it no small error that God should impute to man what he does not have and not impute to him the sin that he has. For it is a judgment of God against the truth. Yes, since the article of justification was simply presented in our Confession, they, being unacquainted with this article, have accused us of almost more errors than the article contains words. These are the sweet sermons which we are forced to hear at this time, and | have no doubt that if you were sitting invisibly in a corner and heard such ungodly words and sermons, you would not only pity us, but also wonder that we, having feet, do not immediately hasten from their midst. Therefore, it is indeed very wisely done

Luther declares himself against the insolence of people who, without being preachers, set themselves up as judges of others. 





Handwritten in Cod. 4517. fol. Bibl. Goth. fol. 72. Printed in the Erlanger Ausgabe, vol. 56, p. I*XVIII and in De Wette- Seidemann, vol. VI, p. 416. 

Now, the F. F. G. know that in public preaching it is right and just to punish injustice, for which God has appointed it; but that each one should, according to his own head, grope and mock the other outside the office of preaching, that is contrary to common peace, and causes dissension, and might otherwise come about. Therefore, it is the duty of the Holy Father to take a serious look and to command them to believe inwardly as they wish, and at home, where they have authority to speak, or when they are ordered to preach publicly, to preach and teach according to their will; the Holy Father, as a secular lord, neither wants to force them nor to enforce them. 

But that they break the common outward peace, and publicly punish in public, and rebuke or make noise and quarrel, since they have no right or power, that is the rebellious spirit, which E. F. G. must and want to counteract, that they should learn how they are not themselves masters in the country, and make and keep peace on both sides, so that no one

The first is to judge the second privately, without orders and out of public office. For it behooves no one to judge and touch another in this way, unless he has a command and office, like a preacher and prince. The Turk also does this, letting everyone believe and teach in his place as he pleases, but keeping peace on all sides so that no one has to offend or touch the other. That is also right and a fine, princely deed. This spirit is not cast out with the finger of God, but with blows.

Eia, dear, yes, you should be painted with red cheeks and white legs; they are also the most pious, but they do not cook well and make bad beds. You will be like the nuns, to whom they put carved Jesus. But they looked around for others who lived there and pleased them better, and saw that they wanted to come out of the convent again. Now, whether your wife be pious or wicked, God will decide. It is said: Tribulationem carnis habebunt hujusmodi [but such will have bodily afflictions], 1 Corinthians 7 [v. 28].

Above all, they must be taught to understand the faith and its power and practice, and to learn that the knowledge must be given by God and not by the people. 


The Spirit of God is the one who is the most powerful force in the world, and the one who is the most powerful in the world, and the one who is the most powerful in the world, and the one who is the most powerful in the world, and the one who is the most powerful in the world. 

But the power of faith is that it justifies us and clothes us with alien righteousness, that is, Christ's, which is the unspeakable gift of the Lord, by which He redeems us from sins and from death and from Satan. 

From this it follows that all our efforts and works for justification and salvation have been and still are in vain, which are everywhere invented, increased and defended by orders, ceremonies, or masses and pilgrimages. 

The custom of faith is to be servants through love, and that we in turn clothe the brother with our righteousness, wisdom, and all goods, just as we are accepted by Christ and clothed and enriched with his goods. 

Therefore it follows that good works are necessary as proofs of the faith that is alive in truth and in deed. 

Among the works, however, these are the first: obeying the authorities in all things, promoting peace, honoring princes, praying for all communities, and being concerned about how we can benefit and be beneficial to them. 

Then come these: to be subject to the parents, to assist the family, and to nourish them with words and with bread, namely, to serve them in both regiment, of the spirit and of the flesh. 

Next, that we be of service to our neighbors in whatever way we can. Among these, the servants of the word are to be placed first, that they may be duly cared for and held in honor. Above all, that this work of ours be insisted upon, namely, prayer, that it be done diligently and zealously for all the already mentioned classes, since we know that God commands it in so many ways, adds His rich promise to it, and is exceedingly pleased with it.

Read the Old Testament two or three times from beginning to end as carefully as possible. Stay longer with the prophets. Then you can turn to your New Testament. Consider how the New Testament agrees with the Old; see also how all the prophets testify of Christ. Then return to the epistles of Paul. Make the epistle to the Romans together with the epistle to the Galatians completely familiar to you and consider them carefully. In these two epistles you can explain all the questions that may arise, or otherwise darker passages of Scripture. Save the Epistle to the Hebrews for the explanation of the various ceremonies, allegories, models, silhouettes and sacrificial customs of the Old Testament. You shall read our books with a scripture of the adversaries, which you have procured, and compare both with the scripture, and test them against the scripture as against a touchstone.

Of predestination, that one should not brood over it, but believe with certainty that one is predestined.

a rash person into God's sanctuary, because you cannot penetrate such deep secrets with your own ability due to the weakness (hebetudine) of your eyes. But listen to Christ, look also to Christ, in whom the Father has made known the secret opinion of His predestination, in whom, once and for all, what had long been hidden is revealed. For through Christ we have been made sure that everyone who believes is predestined by the Father. For whom he hath ordained, he hath also called through the gospel, that he should believe, and be justified by faith. Therefore let not your concern be whether you are predestinated, but rather see to it that you believe in Christ as 1) one justified by Him. If you find yourself in Christ by faith, you will also find yourself chosen and predestined by God. "The Father judges no one." Jn. 5:22. Therefore, all who are anxious and troubled about their transfer should take peace and comfort for their conscience from this passage. For it is true that God chose and ordained some of men, while others are rejected, to eternal life before the foundation of the world was laid. But because God dwells in secret, and His judgments are hidden, we are not permitted to reach so great a depth. Therefore, one must descend to Christ, to whom the Father has given all judgment, in whom He has revealed the hidden mind of His disposition. Now, if you find yourself in Christ through faith, know that you are predestinated. If thou findest thyself not in Christ by faith, but persecutest the word, despisest Christ, and knowest him not, know that thou art rejected. For whatsoever thou findest thyself in Christ, the same thou art in the Lord, because the Father hath committed all judgment unto his Son. This is the judgment revealed in Christ, that the faithful are saved and the unfaithful are condemned. For behold, what is that which is sung in the Psalm [Ps. 18, 27]: "With the pure, thou art pure" (Cum electo electus).

eris). Incidentally, if one were to speak according to divine concepts (as far as the immutability of God is concerned), then the judgment would stand: that he whom God chose before the foundation of the world cannot be lost, for "no one will snatch the sheep out of the shepherd's hand"; 2) but whom he has rejected, he cannot be saved, even if he has done all the works of the saints. The judgment of God is so unchangeable. Therefore, look only to the majesty 3) of the electing Lord, so that you may attain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. In no uncertain terms Augustine says: "Even if the displacement of God is nullified (victa) in us who are in the perils of the present life, 4) it remains unchangeable in Him who has made what is to come, and He does not make dark again what He has illuminated, nor destroy what He has built, nor uproot what He has planted. "God's gifts and calling may not repent him," Rom. 11, 29, and: "The firm foundation of God exists and has this seal: The Lord knows His own," 2 Tim. 2, 19. 5) Therefore, in no way does the transposition make some of the children of God become children of the devil, or the temple of the Holy Spirit become a temple of the devils, or the members of Christ become members of harlots, 1 Cor. 6:15, but rather the transposition makes the children of the devil become the children of God, and the temple of the devils become the temple of the Holy Spirit, and the members of the harlots become the members of Christ, because he binds the strong and takes away his weapons, snatching them out of the power of darkness and transferring them from shame to glory. But those of whom it is said [1 John 2:19], "They went out from us," 2c., they find gone out with their will, fallen with their will. And because it was foreknown of them that they would fall, they were not predestinated.

But when it begins to come into the world, it is half-dead, dies completely. So our gospel would like to bring faith into work and love. But it will not go on, and if love is dead, dies and remains dead, faith is sown and received in vain. Avarice and the other things of the world, which John calls lust of the eyes, rule too strongly. And since wickedness increases, love grows cold and dies in almost everyone, not in many alone.

I. Johann Aurifaber's stories about what happened to Luther from year to year. 


1. Johann Aurifaber's report on what happened to Luther in 1518, to which Luther's own account of what happened to him at the Diet of Augsburg in 1518 is appended. 


This account is found in the Eisleben edition, vol. |, p. 1; in the Altenburg edition, vol. I, p. 149; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XVII, p. 200 and in Walch, vol. XXI, Nachlese, Col. 4*. Luther's narrative, as it happened over tables, is already found in his table speeches, namely in the XXII volume of this collection, Col. 1370; but because this is even more detailed, it has nevertheless been brought here. 


|. After in 1517 Doctor Martinus Luther rvider the papal indulgence at Wittenberg in vigilia omnium sanoctorum positiones posted and disputiret, also preached publicly against it, as then the same sermons have gone out in print, so that he attacked and overthrew the Pabst's hucksterism, fair and drudgery, On the other hand, the leader of the indulgences, Johann Tezel, a preacher-monk, had articles written and printed by Conradum Wimpina, a papal doctor at Frankfurt on the Oder, in which he brazenly defended the indulgences, and with his followers preached against Doctor Luther everywhere, and also exclaimed and condemned him as a heretic; In addition, Silvester Prierias in Rome wrote publicly against D. M. Luther. M. Luther, to which he replied violently, and thus the indulgence became a great scandal: then Pope Leo X was here, and incited the Emperor Maximilian against D. Luther, also sued him vehemently before Duke Frederick, the Elector of Saxony, thus hoped to destroy D. Luther and his teachings. Luther and his teachings. Thereby D. Luther was moved and caused to act more expansively and to eliminate indulgences and other articles of Christian doctrine, and also to discover the Pabst's erroneous and seductive teachings. 

2 When the game was about to break down, Pope Leo sent a letter to Duke Frederick, Elector, 





Anno 1518 on the 23rd day of August written, and D. Luther to the apostolic see in Rome, requesting that His Electoral Grace place him in Rome and hand him over to the authority of the Roman see, and gave further orders to his legate, Thomas of Cajeta, Cardinal, who was then at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. 

3 But Duke Frederick, Elector, in addition to the University of Wittenberg, strove most fiercely to have D. Luther dismissed from the citation and appearance in Rome as most dangerous to him. Luther be released from the citation and appearance in Rome, as it was most dangerous to him, and instead be required to appear before the Cardinal of Cajeta at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, and there give an answer, cause and account of his faith, doctrine, writings and confession. 

4 His Electoral Grace finally received this, and on Friday after Francisci of the 1518th year, Luther arrived in Augsburg on foot and miserably, with food and several intercessions from the Elector of Saxony to the council and other good-hearted people there. 

But what happened between him and Cardinal Cajetano can be heard in this following history told by him, the man of God, at Eisleben in 1546 over tables. 


D. Mart. Luther's Narrative. 


| must tell you how | fared at the Diet of Augsburg. Tezel, who led indulgences around the German country, said that he had greater authority than St. Peter and St. Paul. He said that if someone had committed the greatest sins, he could forgive them. | opposed these lies of his and argued against them. Then the whole world was aroused, the pope and all the priests wanted to become mad; they pressed Maximilianum, the emperor, into scheduling an imperial diet at Augsburg, and Cajetanus, the cardinal, also came there. But they had negotiated with Duke Frederick, the old Elector (of blessed memory), that if the Diet broke up, he should send me out to the Cardinal; which happened.

But Emperor Maximilian read my positiones at Augsburg and said to Pfeffinger, Duke Frederick's councillor: What is your monk doing? Truly, his positiones are not to be despised, he will start a game with the priests! 

When | left by order of Duke Frederick, | was very poor and did not have a penny; in addition, D. Wenceslaus Lincus gave me his cap, went on foot to three miles to Augsburg; there | sat on a wagon and drove into the Augustinian monastery for lodging. Duke Frederick had prescribed to the council there that they should have good regard for me, so that nothing would happen to me; they did so faithfully. But | had gone to Augsburg without an escort, | should, | think, have arrived properly; but Langemantel said that because the Elector had written to them, | should also be obedient to them, and do what they told me, and not go soon to the Cardinal; they wanted to do with me what they knew. 

4th Now the emperor was not at Augsburg, but had gone hunting, and all his councilors were lying there, among whom was Pavisius, the bishop of Trent. When the Cardinal heard that | had arrived, he sent his orator to me, with two servants, to come to the Cardinal; | said, yes, | would come. But because the emperor was away, the councilors said | should not go to him, | had no escort; one should not believe the whales. And especially Doctor Aurbach of Leipzig refused that | should not go, and he also helped me to make the appeal. Then the Cardinal sent to me another time: | should come to him, he was waiting for me. But | said, yes, | wanted to come; but | did not come either. In the meantime, the Augsburg councillors obtained an escort for me from the emperor's council, which lasted for three days; but every day the cardinal's servants came and said: "The cardinal has offered you all grace, why are you afraid? Est mansuetissimus pater [He is a very gentle father]. But another said to me in my ear: Non credas [Do not believe it], he does not hold faith. 

5 On the third day they came again: Quare non venis ad Cardinalem? [Why do you come 








not to the Cardinal?] it would only be about 6 letters, REVOCA [revocations], 

there would have been no need; but there would have been precious letters, and it would not have come to that: Revoca, sed: OCCIDE [Revocations, but: Death]; and | told the Orator freely: it would be forbidden me that | should not go to the Cardinal. Finally, as | did not want to come, the Legatus stopped: Ecquid tu faceres, si ita in manu Cardinalem haberes, ut ipse te habet? Respondi: Omnem reverentiam et omnia bona [What would you do if you had the Cardinal in your hand as he has you? | answered: All reverence and all good]. Then he laughed and said, Ha, ha, nihil est [it is nothing], and said, Putas, quod prin- ceps Fridericus propter te suas terras perdet? Respondi: Nolo. Inquit ille: Ubi igitur ma- nebis? Respondi: Sub coelo [Do you think that Prince Frederick will spoil his lands for your sake? | answered: | do not want that. He said: Where do you want to stay? | answered: Under heaven]. Then he got angry and rode away from me. 

When the Cardinal asked me to come to him, and the council also obtained the Emperor's secretary, the Count of Schamburg, to escort me, | went to him. But they had instructed me finely how | should behave. First of all, | was to lie down on my face before him. When | did so, the Cardinal ordered me to stand up; but | still knelt before him, after which | stood. Then the Cardinal spoke to me very kindly and said: "You have aroused the whole of Germany with your disputation on indulgences. Therefore, if you want to be a member of the church and have a gracious pope, recant everything; then nothing shall happen to you. For | hear that thou art a doctor, and very learned in the Scriptures, and hast much disciple; and wouldst badly that | should recant what | had written. But | said, | could not do it; but | offered to do so, | wanted to be silent for the time being and write nothing more, my adversaries should also only be silent. He would not do that. Then | said that | could not do that either, and so | left him. 

(7) The emperor's councilors, through the bishop of Trento, told the cardinal that | had the emperor's escort, and that they should go against the emperor.

| did not undertake anything; then the Rhine was even inflamed. When | came to him again afterwards, he wanted me to recant badly. Then | became very rude, called him without any title: Vos [You], said: | cannot recant, unless someone teaches me something better; | cannot depart from the Scriptures. As he could not take me anywhere with his Revoca, he cried out in Welsh: O frater, frater, heri fuisti valde bonus, hodie es plane pervorsus [O brother, brother, yesterday you were very good, today you are all wrong], put before me Clementinam 6. But | said that the pope was leading the Scripture falsely, and disputed against the pope. Then Cajetamis became very angry and said: Revoca, aut non revertere [Revoke, or do not come back]. | took the word to heart, non revertere [do not come back], stayed a few more days in Augsburg, wrote two letters to the Cardinal, in which | informed him of my opinion. Since he gave me no answer, D. Staupitz got me a horse, and the council gave me an old rider who knew the ways, and Langemantel helped me out of the city at night through a small gate. There | rode without pants, boots, spurs and sword, and came as far as Wittenberg. The first day | rode eight miles, and when | arrived at the inn in the evening, | was so tired, got down in the stable, could not stand, and fell straight into the litter. 

8) Afterwards at Grafenthal 1) Count Albrecht of Mansfeld caught me, he laughed at my retirement, and there | had to be his guest. So | was not longer than 8 days in Augsburg. The Cardinal would have liked to get me and send me to Rome. It annoyed him very much that | ran away. He thought he had me in his clutches; so he has the eel by the tail. He thought he could not have me more surely than at Augsburg; if he got me, the pope should give him another cardinalate. But isn't it aa shame that they hold me so dear? They would give many thousands of florins to have me, since our Lord Christ was hardly sold for thirty pieces of silver.

(9) They themselves are a cause that the trade has come so far. They wanted to suppress my teachings by force, but God could not stand the Pope's tyranny any longer, especially the one he practiced against John Hus, since he had the ashes and the earth dug up three cubits deep and poured into the Rhine, where dear John Hus was burned. An unkind trade, since the pagans spare the dead. But God, who is the Lord of the dead and the living, is now avenging the innocent blood of John Hus on the priest, which blood will still strangle them. 

10 The priests were immediately afraid of the same position, and Raphael, the Cardinal, wrote to Duke Frederick, the Elector, very kindly, and among other things he indicated: | hear that Ew. churfirstl. Grace has a monk who wants to weaken the power of the Christian Church; he would have liked Duke Frederick to have burned me. But the good prince smelled that the priests were wicked. 


2. Georg Spalatin's account of Luther's plot with Cardinal Cajetan. 


This is connected with Aurifaber's previous story. It is found in the Jena edition (1564), vol. |, p. 108b; in the Wittenberg edition (1569), vol. IX, p. 36; in the Altenburg edition, vol. I, p. 121 andin the Leipzig edition, vol. XVII, p. 178. A part of it is already in the 15th volume of our edition, Col. 557, No. 194; Col. 561, No. 196 and Col. 564, No. 197. The continuation, however, of Spalatin's narrative is as follows: 

D. Martinus made such an answer and brought it to the legate on the following Friday. The legate opposed it in a completely strange way and threw away the answer as if he did not respect it at all. And again he fell back on the previous opinion that he should make a retraction, and finally he said to him: "Go away and do not come back, because you want to make a contradiction. 

In the afternoon, the legate sent to D. Staupitz, and wanted to persuade him with sweetness to be able to contradict Doctor Martinum. 

Doctor Staupitz said that he was not able to do it, because D. Martinus had taught him too much in the Holy Scriptures; thus he had always offered, as he still does, to submit to the Christian Church if he had erred 2c. 

Finally, the legate has agreed to hand over D. Martin's article, 


3242 No. I, 2. 


what he should revoke and hold. But D. Martin has not been entrusted with any of these articles. For it is well to worry that the legate has no well-founded articles and right cause of which he need not be ashamed. 

When the legate D. Martin did not send the articles, nor did he send anything else, Doctor Martin sent to the legate D. Wenceslaum, and asked the legate to lay the matter again graciously and fatherly. 

Then the legate offered himself again in a friendly manner, and said among other things: he no longer considered D. Martin a heretic, he did not want to banish him this time either, because he had received further orders from Rome, because he had sent D. Martin's answer to the pope by his own mail. 

Item: If D. Martinus wanted to revoke only the article concerning indulgences, the matter would be quite bad. For the other article, concerning faith in sacraments, could well suffer interpretation and direction. From which it seems clear that Rome seeks money more than holy faith and blessedness. 

When D. Staupitz heard this, he said that it would be worth something that D. Wenceslaus would have had a notary and a witness. Wenceslaus would have had a notary and witness at the first reported dangerous word, spoken of faith; because it would bring the Romans a noticeable disadvantage and break, if such a proceeding would come further. 

Many distinguished, sensible people have advised and decided that D. Staupitz and D. Wenceslaus should leave again and not trust the whales in any way. For it would be likely that the legate would cause a misfortune by the aforementioned mail, that they would all be caught and put to use. 

So Doctor Staupitz and Doctor Wenceslaus traveled to Nuremberg on one day, each on a special road. 

After that, on Sunday, D. Martinus sent the prior of Pomesaw 1) to the legate and asked in writing to resolve the matter paternally and graciously, and also to forgive him graciously, if he had thought of papal holiness with less reverence than was proper. Then the legate offered himself again in the Welsh manner 2c. 

But the legate has thereafter D. Martinum sit Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and never let require or remind. 

Therefore, several highly competent, favorable friends of Doctor Martin have filed an appeal to the 


1) Léscher, Ref.-Acta, vol. Il, p.479, calls him "Prior Von Pomezau or Pomesan". 


W. XXI. 3243 Pabst, and D. Martins advised him to leave as well and to leave the appeal behind him. 

So D. Martinus insinuated the appeal to the notary in the presence of several witnesses, and received apostolos 2) reverentiales. 

After that, Doctor Martinus rode to Nuremberg early on Wednesday morning and, with the advice of good, understanding friends, left the prior of Pomesaw behind him, so that two days after his departure his appeal would be posted on a gate at the cathedral in Augsburg in the presence of the notary and witnesses. For sensible, good gentlemen and friends have considered this sufficient, and do not want to advise that the appeal be made to the legate himself. 

Doctor Martinus has left Doctor Staupitz at Nuremberg, for he is now visiting there and will then visit the monastery at Kénigsberg. 

The legate offered Doctor Martin several times to give him an escort to Rome. But Doctor Martinus thought of him. For some have said that the legate himself would need an escort. 

If D. Martinus had had the copy of the strict, sharp, unkind, and perhaps fictitious breve at Augsburg, the whales would have been considerably displeased by it; for the whales became quite unpleasant at Augsburg. 

The legate never verbally commemorated the indulgence with a few words against D. Martin, only through other persons, and with hidden words. 

It is considered, and thus talked about, that the Romans begin to be noticeably afraid of the German scholars. 

When Doctor Martinus came before the legate, the prior to the preachers 3) sat with the legate in Augsburg, but never said a word about the matter. 

It has been said that the legate should have admonished the named prior to dispute with D. Martin about indulgences; but the prior answered that he did not want to dispute with him in the same matter. Et fecit sapienter Prior, quia non credo, quod vicisset D. Martinum [And 


2) We repeat here the remark we already made in the 15th volume, Col. 595: The term apostolos is a legal one, and denotes in the Pandects: Report; here it is so much as a letter in which permission is given to bring the matter before a higher authority.

the prior did wisely, because | do not believe that he would have overcome D. Martin]. 

D. Peutinger has said that since His Imperial Majesty learned that the Legate and the Prior named were in agreement about D. Martin. Majesty had learned that the legate and the named prior were in agreement about D. Martin, he is said to have said: Look, this is what the boys do, they have always wanted to have me in their cause; if | would have joined them, they would have become one. 

Doctor Martinus was asked many times in Augsburg to preach, but he always refused with glee, worried that the legate might have thought he was doing it to mock and annoy him. 

Much good has happened to Doctor Martins in Augsburg, especially and before from his host, the Prior of Our Lady's Brethren, item, from Hans Schenken, from D. Peutinger, from Mr. Christoph Langenmantel, from D. Auer, from both Adelmannen, brethren, canons of Augsburg, from D. Ambrosio and Ulrich Jung, brethren, who have shown D. Martins a great deal of friendship and have kept him good company. 

Mr. Erasmus Roterodamus gives the Doctori Martins a great coincidence, likewise almost the whole University of Louvain, and many excellent people in many countries. 

The pope is said to have seated seven of the most learned in Rome over D. Martinus’ Positiones, which after diligent inspection are said to have said: It is true that D. Martinus writes, but it is annoying, glossa, quae tangit pecuniam [a gloss that concerns money]. 

A preacher monk disputed positiones at Rome, against D. Martini's opinion; then a Hispanus came, decided the preacher monk in such a way that he could not have raised an arrow anymore. 

The legate also told D. Martins said that the bishop of Brandenburg had given him some of his materials. 

Finally, D. Martinus has returned to Wittenberg, where he will wait to see what the eternal, merciful God will have done with him according to His divine will and pleasure. For where his opponents will let the matter rest, as it is considered by many, he will wait with diligence for his lesson. 

If, however, he were to be burdened with papal excommunication, he has decided, with the advice of knowledgeable friends, to appeal to the future council and to leave Wittenberg from that time onward to the end, where he hopes to expect the following relief without any worries. For he has placed his will entirely in God's will with it.

land thinks that if he had four hundred heads, he would lose them all before he wanted to revoke the article, which is a violation of the holy faith. 

He also does not want to do anything about the unkind papal breve in honor of my most gracious lord and submissive obedience. But otherwise he wanted to lexplain the Romans' treachery in such a way that they should have recognized it manfully. 

But his answer to the two articles and the appeal has been advised to be printed. But, as | hope, my suggestion will also stand still with it, for the sake of the matter. 

To my most gracious lord he most humbly commands himself, and thanks his C. F. G. with all subservience of Iso many and manifold graces and gracious prescription. 

And now asks nothing more than, if it would be easy for his C. F. G. to prescribe him again against papal holiness, that she wants to command this matter from here in Germany. 

For D. Martinus considers it that the preacher monks deal with it, that they want to force him from Wittenberg; after that they will not leave even those, so D. Martin's will not be left unchallenged, and they will refrain from giving Wittenberg an evil name, since God is in favor of it. 

The Rector of Wittenberg asks me in writing with all diligence to make every effort so that we do not lose D. Martinum from Wittenberg. For if he were to leave, the university would not overcome this damage in human memory, and would lose a great many students and good people. 

It is said that there was a discussion before the legate lion how to deal with D. Martinus. One of them said that he should be urged to contradict himself. Another said that he should be imprisoned. The third said that he should be killed. The fourth said that he should be quieted with kindness and mercy. 

Some think that the legate was not comfortable with this matter. For after he had so badly handled his message about the tithe, and had obtained neither Decimas nor anything else, he would have liked to have handled this matter well. 

What further happened after D. The prior of Our Lady's Brethren in Augsburg will, if God wills it, inform leveryone on his arrival in Wittenberg what has happened after Martin's departure and how the legate has opposed the appeal. 

The nuncius apostolicus did not speak a word with D. Martins.

Stabius is ill at Augsburg and therefore could not come to D. Martins could not come. 

D. Johann Eck has come to Augsburg for the love of D. Martinus, has stood in friendly opposition to him, and has also offered to come in and carry out his cause with D. Carlstadt in a disputation at Leipzig; the people of Wittenberg are happy and willing to do so. 

The Augustinian cardinal is legate in Hispania, like the preacher in Germany. 

The Augustinians have little good to say about their new general, who was previously procurator of the order, and is said to be almost unsuitable for the Germans; therefore, ours must take care. 

The legate is now to let D. Martini transfer the German sermon on indulgences into Latin; what he wants to get out of it will perhaps also be known. 


The story preceding Carl von Miltitz's plot with Luther at Altenburg. 


It is also included among the Aurifaberian reports, although it is not known whether Aurifaber or someone else made it. It is found in Latin in the Wittenberg edition (1550), tom. I, fol. 234b; in the Jena edition (1579), tom. I, col. 209 d. German in the Wittenberg (1569), vol. IX, fol. 64b; in the Jena (1564), vol. I, fol. 141 b; in the Altenburg, vol.

In the year after the birth of Christ 1519 he Carol von Miltitz, one of the nobility in Meissen, was dispatched by Pope Leone X in Germany to the most noble prince, Mr. Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, Elector 2c., who brought a golden rose (as they call it) from Pope Leone X, which was shown to the people on the fourth Sunday in Lent in Rome, as was customary there 2c. For although Duke Frederick did not pretend to be the one who wanted to defend what Doctor Martinus had let go out against the indulgence, nevertheless he did not want to be the judge of it, nor did he want to suppress Luther by force, because the matter was still unrecognized at that time, and no final judgment of the church had been passed on it. 

Therefore, Pope Leo tried, as he could, all kinds of means, sent more than once Ern Carol and other messages to Duke Frederick, to move him against D. Martin, and to take a displeasure, that he intended greater seriousness, and to take the matter against Luther with the sharpness. When he presented Carol von Miltitz with the golden rose, he indicated and recounted Pabst's grave complaint and serious order.

Luther, and secretly with concealed words on Duke Frederick of Saxony, desiring with highest request and pleading that D. M. Luther be suppressed. M. Luther be suppressed. He often brought this up to Carol von Miltitz at court when he returned over a period of time and diligently pursued it. 

But since it was discussed what kind of answer should be given to Carol von Miltitz, the venerable Mr. D. M. Luther repeated these five following articles (which Carol von Miltitz had often lamented at court before) at Altenburg, in Mr. Georgen Spalatini's house.

In the year after the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in 1520, Martin Luther wrote a very serious letter from Wittenberg on the 15th day of January to the Roman Emperor, Carol the Fifth, 1) and requested that his Imperial Majesty not condemn him unheard, but accept his matters, if he is right, and until the final decision. Majesty will not condemn him unheard, but will take care of his affairs, if he is right, and until the final decision. He also publicly protests and testifies that he is willing and ready to follow in all ways where he is taught and instructed something better from the Holy Scriptures. For until now, violence had been done to him, because he had been condemned outright, before he had been convinced with truth and the reason of some error. 

2 On the 24th day of Januarii, the Bishop of Meissen issued a prohibition against a sermon by D. Mart. Luther, in which he advised that the sacrament of the altar should be administered to the laity in both forms. Luther responded to this with all

On the 8th day of July 2) Pope Leo issued a special bull against D. Mart. Luthern, in which his inhumane tyranny, as well as his terrible hatred and envy against the truth of the divine word, is exposed. The same bull was expracticed by D. Eck in Rome and brought against Leipzig, and he supposed to dampen D. Mart. Luther with it. Therefore D. Luther was caused to respond. He revealed the abomination of the Pope and publicly defended his doctrine on the basis of the Holy Scriptures. 

7 And the same bull, and such senseless raving and tyrannical raging of his opponents, the papists, gave Luther cause to write all the more vehemently, and with more angry words than he had done before against the papacy, as the kingdom of Antichrist. 

8 In the month of November, an Imperial Diet was held in Cologne, to which the Pope sent two envoys, named Marinus Caracciola and Hieronymus Aleander, who were summoned by Emperor Carol.

In this year also Emser, D. Hieronymus Ochsenfart and D. Murner wrote vehemently against Martin Luther in Leipzig.

In this 1521st year, Hieronymus Emser in Leipzig wrote vehemently against M. Luther in German, and this out of incitement of Duke Georgen of Saxony, who was deeply annoyed that D. Luther had written publicly against the Bishop of Meissen. Luther had written publicly against the Bishop of Meissen; item, that he attacked the Pope so violently in the book to the Christian nobility, and for the sake of D. Carlstadt's book about the images?) 

Murner also wrote similar things against him. But Luther despised the same scribe and enemy, and did not answer him much about his three books. 

The Bishop of Meissen and Merseburg bought up many of Martin Luther's books and had them burned. 

4 Ambrosius Catharinus in Italy, a Thomist, also wrote a book against Luther and protected the Pope's primacy and sovereignty, to which Luther replied.

The king had an edict issued publicly, in which a council was appointed for the following year, and all authorities were commanded to prevent all innovation and change of religion here, according to the content and expulsion of all articles, which are listed and understood in the same edict; as this edict is printed in the following. 

2) On the basis of such an edict, because it was not interpreted in the same way, M. Luther had his declaration to the assembled imperial estates printed. 

In this year, D. Martinus Luther, with much reading and constant preaching, vigorously pursued his doctrine and spread it far and wide. 

4 So also the priest marriage in this year has come again in Schwang. For the provost of Kemberg, M. Bartholomaus Feldkirch, who was the first to take a wife, followed D. Andreas Carlstadt, canon of Wittenberg, and held a matrimonial wedding in Wittenberg. Item, the pastor of Cranach, He Johann Grau, also held marriage in Wittenberg, who soon after became pastor of Weimar. 

5 Thus also to the German orders, that they should enter into matrimony, D. Mart. Luther sent out a special admonition in print this year. 

6 The canons of the monastery in Wittenberg have also changed their ungodly ceremonies in response to D. Luther. Luther's manifold letter, instruction and admonition and exhortation, the canons in the monastery of Lutherberg changed and dropped their ungodly ceremonies with the mass, saint service, vigils and other things, and instead arranged Christian useful ceremonies with sermons, Christian lectionaries and useful hymns and other things. 

Doctor Johann Faber and Emser at Leipzig wrote vehemently against Martin Luther. When in this 1523th year Pope Adrianus, the sixth of this name, died in Rome in the autumn month, and Clemens VII was elected Pope, he and his cardinals sent a legate, as Campejum, to Nuremberg in Germany. But when the legate did not find the Elector of Saxony there, to whom he had especially advertised, the Pope reminded the Elector of Saxony in writing for the second time that he wanted to arrive at Nuremberg in person, and to be helpful to his legate, so that the disputed religious matter would be settled, and common peace and unity would be maintained in the Church of the German land. 

8 In the meantime, some have also thought of means by which the division of religion between D. Mart. Luther, and also his opponent, might be overcome, as in worldly terms. 


GleaningsNo. |, 5. 





3253 


In matters of religion, as if they were matters of the world, people always try to make a comparison, to put Christ and the devil together in one bed. 

9 And this was the proposal: one should appoint a place 1) as Zerbst or Naumburg, since approximately around Michaelmas the Cardinal and Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg, and the Bishop of Merseburg, also D. Martinus Luther should arrive. Martinus Luther should arrive and appear. There, each party was to draw four or five persons to and next to them for such an action, and to speak and act in the smoothest way possible about D. Martini's doctrine, matters and articles, to hear his answer and instruction, and to try whether one would like to unite and compare the same articles, all or in part, according to reasons and indications from the Holy Scriptures introduced by both sides. 

(10) For such an amicable action, two secular princes, if they were able, should be called in to hear how this action would proceed. Thus Duke John and Duke George of Saxony were proposed for this purpose. And since they are not able to do so, other secular princes, or at least two counts, should be used. 

In the meantime, however, Martin Luther should refrain from harsh writing, especially harsh writing against the authorities. Also, Martin Luther should be provided with sufficient escort to and from such a trading day. And what was then acted upon on this day, and not decided by the two ecclesiastical princes and princes, together with the two secular princes or counts, was to be disclosed, so that it remained undisclosed and was kept secret. 

12) Thereupon D. Martin Luther also submitted his answer, at the request of Elector Frederick of Saxony, 2) and excused his harsh letter, also complained about D. Johann Fabri, the bishop's vicar at Costnitz, and Emser's blasphemy books, which had gone out against him, and indicated "that he was not afraid of his things, nor ashamed of them, but wanted to preserve them against all devils". But nothing came of this trading day. 

Otherwise, Martin Luther had many useful, good little books printed in this 1523rd year, such as, to the council of Prague, how one should choose church servants, item, avoid human doctrine.

Also how to hold Christian mass, item, of godly ceremonies. He also wrote a magnificent book against the canon or private mass, saying that itis a terrible abomination.

1 In this 1524th year, a new imperial edict was issued against D. Mart. Edict against D. Mart. Luther's teachings and person, dated April 18 at Nuremberg. Such edict let D. Mart. Luther himself printed this edict, next to the mandate that had gone out against him at Worms in 1521, made a preface to it, and indicated in it that these two imperial mandates were in disagreement and against each other. He is unflinching and consistent in his teaching, and admonishes the princes and sovereigns that they should not offend him and his teaching. 

2 The University of Ingolstadt also condemned D. Martin Luther's teachings, against which he wrote; just as the papal bulls and others of his opponents attacked him severely with writings in this year. But he resisted, and against the elevation of Bishop Benno of Meissen, 1) item, against the Romanist in Leipzig, the like against the whole Pabbacy and abomination of the still mass or the Canon fiercely wrote. 

In addition, he also sent out comforting writings for the acceptors and confessors of the Gospel, such as to the Christians of Augsburg, to the people of Miltenberg, to those of Riga in Latvia; item, admonition to the German princes and cities to establish and order schools for the youth. 

He also sent out a warning letter to Duke Frederick of Saxony, Elector, and to Duke John, his brother. Item, to the city of Mihlhausen, against the rebellious spirit of Thomas Munzer, as a testimony that his heart was not inclined to any outrage, unrest "or rebellion. 

5 And after having heard above in the 22nd year how D. Andreas Carlstadt (when D. Luther was in his patronage) had caused change and innovation in the church at Wittenberg out of ambition, against which Doctor Luther had been busy with reading, preaching and

The devil aroused great enmity in D. Carlstadt against D. Luther. Carlstadt against D. Luther, about which he became deadly hostile to his person and doctrine, and left his preaching and lecturing at Wittenberg, to which he was appointed as an archidiacon by electoral foundation. In 1523, he moved to a village called Segren 2) to lead a private or peasant life there; he even drove the horses at the plow, no longer wanted to be called Doctor Andreas Carlstadt, but Brother Andres. 

6 Although D. Luther made every effort to bring him back on the right track through instruction, pleading and admonition, it was in vain. The University of Wittenberg also punished him for it, and Philippus Melanchthon, D. Jonas and Mr. Dieterich von Biela acted in the matter, but all in vain; for even though he offered to remain silent, he still secretly practiced against it. 

7. finally, he made it clear that everyone should be a layman, condemned master and doctor degrees, which were common in universities, and discouraged many people from studying who went into the trades. Nevertheless, he pretended great holiness and heavenly revelation, and taught how to listen in the corner to the heavenly revelation and voice, and be assured of the Spirit, and led people away from oral words, through which God alone deals with us. 

And since he could not accomplish anything in Saxony and Wittenberg, he found himself in this 1524th year around Michaelmas in Thuringia towards Orlamiinda; because there around the Saale many celestial prophets behaved and transcribed, and bit out the priest Magister Conradum 3) there, and also caused the iconoclasm there. 

9 Now V. Martin Luther, out of the command of the Prince of Saxony, went to Carlstadt against Jena and Orlamiinda, and acted to set him right; but his hopeful spirit did not let him come to any _ huniility, improvement, nor revocation. And Martin Luther in Orlamtnda was almost thrown out with stones and mud and chased out. 

When, after a long, varied, cultivated action, which extended into the third year, no change was seen at Carlstadten, he was finally ordered by a princely edict to leave the country; he was very angry about this, and turned himself in.

In this year, on the 20th Sunday after Trinity, Doctor Martin Luther first took off his monk's cap and began to wear a black preacher's skirt, for which skirt Duke Frederick, Elector, had previously given him the cloth, with these words: he should make him a preacher's skirt, or monk's cap, or if he liked, a Hispanic cap, so that the Elector of the monks secretly mocked. 

Erasmus Roterodamus also opposed Martin Luther in this year and had the book about the free will of man in his conversion printed; King Henry of England (to whom Pope Clement had sent the Golden Rose of Rome in England in this year) provoked and pushed him to do so, as Erasmus himself testifies in an epistle ad Cardinalem Eboracensem. But in the following 25th year, Martin Luther refuted the same book 


tremendously. Anno 1525.

In this twenty-fifth year a new fire has been lit and a great noise has arisen, which the devil has aroused against Luther's teachings, namely the peasants’ revolt. For in Alsace and Swabia, also in Franconia and Thuringia, the peasants have risen up, stormed the monasteries, burned and destroyed the castles and residences of many noblemen, wanted to withdraw obedience from princes, counts and other authorities, and even proposed to abolish them and put them to death. And especially in Thuringia there was such rebellion and game beginner and Nadleinsfihrer Thomas Munzer, pastor of Allstadt, who camped with the peasants to Frankenhausen. 

2 Against this murderous spirit lay down with serious writings Dort. Martin Luther and warned the 


Nachlese, No. I, 5. 


L2. XXI, 32"-35-. 


3257 


He wrote to the city of Muhlhausen before the mint, and also to other estates to beware of outrages and riots. In the same way, Philippus Melanchthon had several splendid writings printed to extinguish this fire. But God, as a founder and protector of supremacy, soon controlled this murderous spirit. For on the Rhine River, many thousands of the rebellious peasants were slain by Duke Anthoni of Lorraine at Alsace-Zabern; but the Swabian peasants were put down by the Swabian League. Thus, Prince John, Duke George of Saxony, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and Duke Henry of Brunswick also defeated the rebellious peasants at Frankenhausen, and had Thomas Muenzer captured and beheaded in front of Mulhouse together with one of his companions, called Pfeiffer. 

On Easter Day, when Luther had preached early in Wittenberg, he left after noon for Mansfeld, and visited Eisleben, Stolberg, Nordhausen, Erfurt, Weimar, Orlamtinde, Kahla and Jena, there to control the uprising with preaching and exhortations; but in his absence Duke Frederick, Elector, died in Lochau, and was buried in Wittenberg on Wednesday after Jubilate. Therefore M. Luther hurriedly returned to Wittenberg on the Saturday after Misericordias Domini and preached there on the Sunday Jubilate. 

On the Sunday of Cantata, M. Luther re- established the ordination of preachers in the apostolic manner, after the early sermon in Wittenberg, and M. Georg Roérer was the first ordainer. 

5 In this year D. M. Luther entered into matrimony, and on the Tuesday after St. John the Baptist's Day he married Catharina von Bore, a noblewoman who had been a convent virgin, at Wittenberg, whose matrimony he had previously praised and defended to the highest degree from God's Word with sermons and several beautiful writings, and also advised and helped many people in the spiritual and secular classes. 

When Carlstadt was hostile to M. Luther and his teachings, and the Sacramentarian error renewed, that is why the principality of Saxony forbade him (which made Carlstadt very angry and put all the blame for his exile on D. Luthern; but D. Luthern was not the only one who had to pay for his exile). Luthern; but D. Luther excused himself sufficiently. Luther apologized sufficiently and indicated that there were other reasons why the princes of Saxony did not want him to suffer in their principality), and Carlstadt saw that the peasants’ revolt was subdued, he also feared that he would be in danger of his life, limb and goods.

which is found below in the X. 1) For this man's death stroke, this portentum happened in Magdeburg, that in the high monastery, on the day of Cirvumcisionis Domini, all lights went out and went out, except for the few lights that hung in front of the Sacramenthauslein (as one used to call it). This may have been caused by a wind, but it certainly meant that the light of the Gospel, which Georg Winkler had begun to teach, should go out again, as it did after his death. 

In this year, Emperor Carl's warband, whose leader was Duke Carl of Barbon, went to the Kingdom of Neapolis and on the way attacked the city of Rome, besieged it, and on the 6th day conquered and plundered Maji. Then Pope Clement with the Cardinals was chased into the Engelburg, and besieged until the seven months inside, and a serious visitation, so God had passed over the Pope and his clergy. 

On the Saturday after the Visitationis Mariae, Doctor Martin Luther fell into a great weakness of body and illness in Wittenberg. In addition, he was afflicted with great spiritual temptations, and the spirit of sadness plagued him badly; such weakness of body and spirit tortured and mortified him so much, 2) that he could not regain his strength in three months. 

In this 27th year there was another glorious confessor of the Gospel and martyr, Mr. Leonhard Kaiser, who was imprisoned by the bishop of Passau because he had taught that there were only two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper of Christ. Item, that the mass is not a sacrifice, item, the monastic vows and purgatory are nothing, and that man has no free will in matters of God. For these articles he was condemned as a heretic by the bishop and Doctor Ecken, who sat in court with him, and burned by Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria on the 16th day of August. Duke John, Elector of Saxony, wrote an intercession for this man to the Bishop of Passau, but it did not help. However, Doctor Martin Luther sent him a beautiful letter of comfort in his prison. 

7 Erasmus Roterodamus also wrote vehemently against Luther in this year; but Luther did not answer it, therefore that

23. XXI, 38*-41*. 


his book of the Servo Arbitrio remained unrefuted and unbitten by Erasmum. 

8 Against the sacramentarians, as the Zwinglium and Oecolampadium (who were also joined by Urbanus Regius and Martinus Bucerus, who two later abandoned such error), D. Martin Luther wrote in this year the witty book, whose title is: "That the words of Christ, that is my loan, still stand firm". By which book many people were strengthened in the pure doctrine of the Lord's Supper. But the sacramentarians began to become quite nonsensical and furious, especially Zwinglius, who answered vehemently against it. However, this anger hurt Luther so much that the devil caused such strife and quarrels among those who all professed the doctrine of the gospel, and Luther had to engage and fight with these false brothers. 

After the devil had stormed against Luther and his teachings in all kinds of ways, with tyranny and persecution, also by false teachings and red spirits, but had not received anything from God's grace, he thought about how he destroyed and devastated the university and high school in Wittenberg (from which great damage and destruction happened to him and _ his kingdom). Therefore, by God's decree, he awakened a pestilence there, in which few people were strong; thus a horror, fear and terror arose in Wittenberg, that the students suddenly left, and the university had to be moved to Jena in Thuringia. 

10 Philip Melanchthon traveled there with all the doctors and professors, and Luther and Pommer remained alone in Wittenberg. There came also the pestilence in D. Luther's house, that some persons from it lay ill; however, none of them died, and IX Luther did not leave his house, because he feared nothing at all for this plague. Later, he sent out a paper in print, "Whether one may flee from dying." On the tenth day of December a daughter, called Elisabeth, was born to Doctor Martin Luthern.

2. Luther also attacked the Sacramentarians anew and harshly, and had his great confession of the Lord's Supper printed, to shut the mouths of the blasphemers and contradictors, according to St. Paul's teaching and command, and to defend and protect the truth of the divine word through such his struggle and dispute with the Sacramentarians. 

(3) From this, those would like to take an example of how one should seriously stand up against the red spirits and false teachers, who otherwise not only no longer want to argue or write against them, but also do not want to suffer that the journeymen are remembered. 

He also sent out a serious warning to beware of the doctrine of the Sacramentans, and in that year Urbanus Regius fell away from the Sacramentans.

3263 Mainz, Wurzburg and Bamberg, and by negotiation of Archbishop Richard of Trier and Count Palatine Ludwig, both Electors, this discord has been settled, as reported above in the 26th year. 

9 In this year also the disagreement of Duke George of Saxony with D. Martin Luther arose, which has risen because of this Mainzian alliance, of which D. Martin Luther wrote to Wenceslaum Linken, which letter Duke George received and D. Martin Luther attacked in public print. Martin Luther has attacked in public print, in an onerous manner, as can actually be seen from his letter below. Therefore, several books and writings subsequently went out in reply from D. Martin Luther. 

In the month of March, Mrs. Elisabeth, née Queen of Denmark, Elector Joachim's wife in Brandenburg,

Luther had a}Christ in both forms, whereupon she came into great 


magnificent letter printed (in which their error was exposed), and thus the holy man closed and fenced all the gaps that the devil otherwise tore open with false teachings to harm the church of God. 

The city of Brunswick also accepted the teaching of the Gospel and wrote to Wittenberg for preachers; Johann Bugenhagen, otherwise called Pomeranian, was sent there, and he established the church there with teaching and ceremonies. Which Christian example was subsequently followed in the month of October by the city of Hamburg and also Goslar, which revealed itself to the teachings of the Gospel through D. Martin Luther. Martin Luther, and the people of Hamburg have also required Pomerania to join them, and have had their churches reformed and made Christian. Thus, Luther's teachings have also come to the seaside towns. 

In this year, Martin Luther also began to translate the Bible and to begin with the translation of the prophets, which was an arduous and difficult task for him. But such work took several years, for the sake of his great business, until it was completely finished. 

8) The armament of Prince John of Saxony and of Landgrave Philip of Hesse against the allies of the Mainz, as revealed by Otto Pack, as King Ferdinand, the Prince of Brandenburg, Duke George of Saxony, the Dukes of Bavaria, and the Bishops of Saxony.

G. secretly out of the Mark and brought her to Duke Johannsen, Elector of Saxony. G. remained there until the year 1546, and was a Christian princess and lover of Luther's teachings, so that her Electorate was often in Germany. G. often visited D. Mart. Luther's dwelling for a quarter of a year and longer, but otherwise stayed at Lichtenberg's house. 

In the month of July, a nobleman by the name of Nicket von Minkwitz fell in the land of the Elector of Brandenburg, as in the city of Furstenwalde, under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Lebus, with several hunters, and the priests in the cathedral, as well as the citizens of the same place, plundered, and went away with the loot. 

In the month of August, on the 5th day, Luther's daughter Elisabeth, born to him a year ago, died. 

This year, too, in the month of September, the antinomy began, albeit secretly, that one should preach the knowledge of sin from the Gospel and point the law to the town hall. Which error beginner M. Johannes Agricola, at that time schoolmaster at Eisleben, was. But this fire has been extinguished by D. M. Luther's letter and an act, held at Torgau before Prince John, was dampened and extinguished, until Anno 1538 such fire of the Antinomians, again made smoldering and burning by M. Agricola, went out to door and windows. But through D. Martin Luther's several 


3264 


Disputations and a number of letters to the editor have once again dampened and depressed it, and M. Agricola has had to recognize, revoke, and deny his error. 

In this 28th year, Elector John of Saxony also had the churches of his principality visited. 

Miss Ursula, Duchess of Miinsterberg, secretly escaped with two nuns from the convent at Freiberg, and came to Wittenberg, and then printed her apology as to why her princely family left this spiritual life. G. left this spiritual life. 

Margrave George of Brandenburg and the city of Nuremberg also reformed their churches this year and planted the teachings of the Gospel in them. 


Anno 1529.

In the beginning of this 1529th year, the papal mass in Strasbourg was abolished by the council, against which the clergy and also the bishop of Strasbourg were vehemently opposed, and Emperor Carl had his envoys act seriously with the council to avert it; but he was unable to obtain anything. 

2 In the month of January, Luther first published the German Catechismum, in which the main points of Christian doctrine with their interpretations are usefully compiled and summarized for young people and the common man. 

After this year's concern about the Turkish invasion of Austria and Germany, D. M. Luther had a booklet about the war against the Turks printed in public in the month of March. M. Luther had a booklet about the war against the Turks printed in public in the month of March. 

4 At Speier, around Easter of the same year, the Imperial Diet began, where, instead of Emperor Carl, the King of Bohemia and Hungary, Ferdinandus 2c., with Prince John of Saxony, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, Margrave George of Brandenburg, Duke Franzen of Liineburg and Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt, and the imperial cities that professed the Gospel, all kinds of serious actions were taken for the sake of religion; and accordingly, great pains were taken to establish separation between the Protestant princes and imperial cities.

mingen, Lindau, Heilbrunn, and others, came before the princes. And at the same imperial diet against King Ferdinandi and the other papal princes and chieftains, ecclesiastical and secular, cunningly and earnestly acting, seeking and requesting, a magnificent protestation was handed over by the Protestant princes and chieftains, also imperial cities. Therefore, these Protestant estates have been called the protesting estates throughout the world. 

6. on the 5th day of May a daughter, called Magdalena, was born to D. M. Luther. 

In the month of September, Solimannus, the Turkish emperor, fell in Austria with a large war force, besieged the city of Vienna, fired on it, broke down a large section of the wall, and stormed the city in the same open place. But God helped with mercy that the Turks did not succeed with the storm. Therefore, the Turkish emperor hurriedly left and departed from the siege to Hungary. So that God granted His Christian Church in the German land still some time of air and peace from the cruel enemy, the Turk, so that the doctrine of the Gospel might run all the further and spread; for the devil would have liked to strike a blow at the Gospel through the Turk. 

Around this time, D. M. Luther also printed a sermon against the Turk to comfort the Christians who were in great terror, fear and trembling before the Turk. 

9 At the same time, a new swift disease appeared in the German country, called the English addiction or sweating sickness, because people began to sweat, and in 24 hours they were alive and 1) dead, with many thousands of people everywhere. 

In Cologne on the Rhine in this year two were burned for the sake of the teaching of the Gospel, Peter Flistedius and Adolphus von Clarenbach. 

On the third day of October, the colloquium at Marburg in Hesse began. For after Huldericus Zwinglius and Oecolampadius had raised an erroneous doctrine and opinion about the Lord's Supper of Christ, and M. Luther had violently opposed it, and on both sides many books and fierce pamphlets had gone out against each other, as if the noble, highborn prince and lord, Philip, Landgrave of Hesse, 2c., would have gladly settled such a dispute (which brought great annoyance and damage to the church of Christ) in a Christian manner; therefore he negotiated with the Elector of Saxony and the other protesting states. 


1) "and" put by us instead of: "or". 


3266 


The same was done with the Swiss, who sent their theologians to Marburg to talk and discuss with each other in a friendly and amicable manner, so that a Christian unity and_ settlement could finally be 


reached, and the written bitterness 


would remain. 

So Martin Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, Justus Jonas, Justus Menius and Fridericus Myconius arrived from Wittenberg. From Switzerland Huldericus Zwinglius and Johannes Oecolampadius have appeared. The city of Strasbourg sent Martinum Bucerum and Caspar Hedio. The city of Nuremberg sent Osiandrum, the city of Augsburg Stephanum Agricolam; then Johannes Brentius, and the landgrave also required his theologians, as D. Erhard Schnepf, Dionysium N. 1) 2c. 

As Luther and Zwinglio and Philip Melanchthon and Oecolampadio colloquized two days after each other, they compared themselves in the main points of Christian doctrine. However, Zwingli and Oecolampadius did not want to be shown that the true body and blood of the Lord Christ was in the Lord's Supper; they also did not allow themselves to be shown the truth in front of their churches, where they planted the error of Berengarii, and thus denied the truth out of fear of man and did not want to confess it. 

14 Thus the colloquium dissolved and the theologians amicably parted with the offering of hands. But the theologians at Wittenberg did not want to take the Swiss theologians for their brothers and accept them, lest they be regarded as approving their false doctrine. And Luther's steadfastness is especially to be praised, who did not pretend, collude, or lie in cahoots with the sects and the sectarians (as many of them did at that time). In this year, M. Luther and Duke George of Saxony came into conflict due to public pressure; D. Luther had the booklet of the stolen letters published against him. 

At the end of the month of November, the 


protesting estates had a day in Schmalkalden, and wanted ta canciilt an an alliance and racictancre

On the Sunday after St. John the Baptist, the princes and lords of the other part met to discuss the confession. 

On the 3rd Monday after St. John the Baptist, the mayor, the city council, and the common city of Augsburg paid homage to the Roman imperial majesty on the square in front of the city hall. Roman imperial majesty stood in the oriel on top of the town hall, and next to his imperial majesty the three princes of Mainz, Cologne and Brandenburg, also the marshal of Pappenheim with the bare sword, and Caspar Sturm, herald. And the homage was paid, with fingers extended, between ten and eleven o'clock at noon; there were several thousand men. 

The same morning, the princes, archbishops, princes and bishops who were not attached to the Gospel were together and talked about the Gospel.

5 Afterwards, the same day, Imperial Majesty rode to Wellenburg Castle of the Cardinal of Salzburg. Majesty rode to Wellenburg Castle, of the Cardinal of Salzburg, which Emperor Maximilian, in praiseworthy memory, had given him. 

Now thirty-five years, as our host here in Augsburg, Wilhelm Arzt, has told us, the people of Augsburg have also paid homage to Emperor Maximilian. 

Erasmus Roterdam is said to be still alive, but almost ill; His Imperial Majesty has written to him. It is thought that she would like to have him here at the Reichstag, but it is not known whether he can or will come. 

8 The Queen of Hungary and Behem, Mary, sister of the Roman Emperor and King Ferdinandus, has so far not wanted to deny her her sermon, but the Imperial Majesty has said and warned her to be careful not to be deceived by the priests as her husband King Louis and her brother King Ferdinandus were deceived by them. Majesty should have told and warned her to be careful, so that she would not be deceived by the priests, as her husband King Louis and her brother King Ferdinandus were deceived by them. 

9 Our confession has been brought by the imperial majesty of her secretaries, one, Alexander SchweiB, in French; another secretary has brought it in Welsh. They say that the clergy give both wine and other things in great quantity to Cardinal Campegius. Many people want to have the same confession, and they strive for it diligently. So it is a thing that he who is not Lutheran cannot spoil it, he may do what he will. Again, whoever is Lutheran, even if he were one of the most pious, has completely ruined it. 

10 Recently a prince is said to have said before several other princes and lords: The Lutherans have handed over a document written in ink; if | were emperor, | would give them another document with rubrics, that is, written in red ink. To this another prince is said to have replied: the emperor must nevertheless pay attention if he wants to write with rubrics, as you, sir, say, so that the presilges do not 1) spill under his eyes. 

Duke George of Saxony is sometimes very friendly to my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, but in the matter concerning God's word, he is still to be very hard and fast. 

(12) This is a great defect in the imperial court, that even some of its highly learned servants say that there is not one man who understands the things of the gospel; so much so that they do not know the things of the gospel.

she has nothing of these things, and yet has many priests and monks around her. 

(13) Some bishops are much better, kinder and more lenient in the Lutheran cause than some secular princes; therefore, let us pray to God that He may ward off the devil, amen. 

14 The Cardinal Campegius should have our confession translated into French and sent to the pope, since the pope does not understand Latin very well. The same cardinal shall also have orders from the pope to stop some abuses. 

The imperial cities are very divided, for the fewest are righteous; the others are either Zwinglian or papist. 

16. Thursday after Petri and Pauli, my gracious lords, Margrave George of Brandenburg and Duke John Frederick of Saxony, have been with the two queens 2) of Hungern and Behem after noon for several hours, and the queens have both behaved almost honestly, chastely and milderly towards their princely graces. 

On the Thursday after St. Peter's and St. Paul's, the Imperial Majesty graciously requested that my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, come to his Imperial Majesty on the following Friday. Majesty 2c. 

18 The Queen Mary Preacher is said to have many good things to say about her, especially that she is well versed in Latin and always has a Latin Bible with her, even when hunting; and if a preacher does not like the Scriptures, she looks for them and talks about them. She also does not listen to the great crier and barefoot Medardus, the king's preacher, so she has to do it. 

19. the Queen Preacher, an honest, friendly man, has sent us the following list of twenty Doctores 2c. who are against the Lutherans here in Augsburg.

Our counterpart, the scholars, have become much more silent and conscientious about the confession than they were before. 

22. Majesty has a monk of the Order of the Barefoot for a confessor, a Spaniard, who is said to be almost sympathetic to our cause, kind and inclined, and probably also preaches; King Ferdinand's preacher, also of the Order of the Barefoot, Medardum, the great screamer, who was also at Speier, cannot stand around him. 

There are always other things going on besides the Gospel. 

24 Some cardinals themselves confess that our cause and doctrine is right, but it should not have been done without the help of more than one; they do not see how they can be compared, they do not want to have acted wrongly in any way.

home, acted, by reason of the gospel, on a back passage. 

The people of Strasbourg have traded with many imperial cities. However, neither Costnitz, nor Ulm, nor Heilbrunn, nor Memmingen, nor Frankfurt, nor others have signed their confession and adhered to their doctrine; therefore, Strasbourg stands alone with its doctrine and confession. 

On the day of the Visitation, my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, visited the Emperor before noon. Majesty before noon and asked for the fiefs. 

29 Imperial Majesty and yours confess that we are not mistaken in articles of faith; but could suffer that in external things, before in some, we compared and united with the others up to a concilium. 

30. Majesty's confessor said to Magister Philippo Melanchthon: "| am surprised that in German lands some scholars dispute this speech that one becomes justified and pious by faith, because | have long believed it to be so and have also talked about it with many scholars. 

(31) Some princes are very much opposed to the Gospel, but their counsels are very kind and inclined. Some councils have also told their lords in plain sight, among other warnings, that if war should come, God would be for it, that they would not have the consequence of their own people. 

On the 32nd Sunday after the Visitation of Our Lady, the Imperial Majesty had with him my most gracious Lord, the Elector of Saxony, Margrave George of Brandenburg and the Landgrave of Hesse. 

There is further talk that Imperial Majesty does not have a single person at her court who understands Protestant matters. Majesty did not have a single person at her court who understood the Protestant teachings. Majesty sent our confession to the University of Louvain, even though it was eighty miles away. 

34 It is said that the bishops cannot unite in this matter of the Gospel. 

The people of Frankfurt have also publicly stated that they want to remain with the confession of my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony. 

Our confession has been requested to be rewritten for the King of England, for the King of Portugal, for the Duke of Julich, for the Duke of Lorraine, and for other great princes. We want to bring it, if God wills, in Latin and German.

Similarly, Doctor Mensing, the preacher-monk of Margrave Joachim, also went with them; for he returned with his son, probably half with the margrave's displeasure. And Doctor Mensing is said to have said to the other doctors: If you do not want to do otherwise, it is the same for me, | will also soon throw off my cap; for there is no one who is against Doctor Martinus and God's teachings. 

The archbishop of Cologne is said to have said last year: | ama bishop and should govern my church and preach; now | cannot; but | only want to leave my diocese, that this matter may be judged to good peace. 

43 Faber and Cocleus are especially maliciously rumored before others, that they lie and deceive quickly, and speak and act differently before the man than behind him. 

44 It is said again, even by some Bavarians themselves, that Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria said to Doctor Ecken: | have been told much differently about Luther's teaching than | have heard in their confession. You have also put me off, that their doctrine is too embarrassing. Then Doctor Eck spoke: With the fathers | would dare to embarrass them, but not with the Scriptures. Then Duke Wilhelm turned away from him. 

45 A Spanish captain was lying with the emperor's confessor, and a Spaniard said to Melanchthon, "Will Luther come?

On the Sunday after the Visitation of the Virgin Mary, the emperor informed the princes that he wanted to hear mass at St. Ulrich's on Monday, St. Ulrich's Day; whoever had the opportunity, would ride there with him. 

On Monday, St. Ulrich's Day, he rode to St. Ulrich's for mass, and almost all the princes with him, except my most gracious lord, his fellow princes, and the Hessian, who stayed at home. 

48 Johann Pommer has written to us here that the gospel in Lubeck and Liineburg is rising quickly. 

49. Item, that Christ has almost taken over the whole sea and lake. May God continue to have mercy, amen. So it goes in the world, the pope and bishops and princes want to drive out God's word in the Roman Empire, and in foreign kingdoms they accept it with joy. O let us ever pray that God's word may remain with us. 

(50) The people of Augsburg are almost evil with the Word of God and their preachers, for the noble seed cannot come up among the thorns; they fear very much that they will lose all their best and purest preachers because of this, for some princes are already seeking after some of them. 

The Queen Mary Preacher is forbidden to preach even now, although the pious Queen has faithfully asked for it. 

Tuesday after the Visitation of Our Lady, the bishops and princes, our retinue, were all together in the town hall. 

On the same day, the imperial cities informed the imperial majesty in a written supplement of the reasons why they did not sign the imperial edict against the Lutheran doctrine at the last imperial diet at Speier, and in it they all confessed, along with those of Strasbourg, that they were dependent on our next confession; it is only to be taken for granted that those of Strasbourg appended two articles in which they do not agree with us, perhaps concerning the sacrament. 

(54) The bishops and princes, depending on them, have had such unseemly and unfriendly attacks from and against the gospel that two bishops, some of them want to believe it to be so, have

The two cities of Mainz and Augsburg have said: if they do not want to do it differently, then they also want to do away with them and no longer be part of it. 

The King of Poland's message here, Dantiscus, bishop of Culm, is well versed in the Gospel, and is very fond of our people. 

(56) Where the bishops and princes find out about a prince, whom they condemn and respect for being Lutheran, they do not draw him to their attacks. 

For this reason, when they have spoken of the Gospel, they have on several occasions excluded Duke Henry of Mechelburg, brother-in-law of my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony. Summa, the world is blind, mad and foolish. 

58 On Wednesday, St. Margaret's Day, our counterparts, doctors, priests and monks, have handed over to Imperial Majesty their transfer with these titles and piles of books, as follows.

3275 Wednesday after Visitationis. 

It is said that the papist princes and bishops cannot make up their minds and agree to any answer, and that four princes have left their chambers, because they were so displeased with their conduct: for they wanted to make it dull and bad, and to bring about an eight, to cool their little mill. 

60 Doctor Urbanus Regius, the most learned and best preacher here in Augsburg, comes to Duke Ernsten of Luneburg and Brunswick, Duke Franzen's brother. 

61 Some of the princes’ chancellors and councilors have let themselves be heard in such a Christian manner that they can no longer suffer their lords in this matter in the council, for they have quickly complied with their prince. 2) 

62 Thursday after Visitationis, the Emperor went hunting. Majesty rode on the hunt, shortly thereafter, when a number of imperial cities handed over their documents, in which they signed the confession and fell to it, although at the request of my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony 2c), as has been partly said. Some say that it was done by all imperial cities, except Strasbourg, which should have a note with them, perhaps to indicate their faith in the sacrament. Some say otherwise, so it turns on each other. 

The papists here have become two sects at this Diet, for some good ones could suffer peace, but some seek only war and bloodshed; God forbid them, amen. 

64. Thursday after Our Lady's Visitation, our counterpart, the Papal Princes, Bishops and Doctors, have delivered their answer to our confession, apology, and reverence to Imperial Majesty at nine o'clock in the afternoon. Majesty at nine o'clock at noon. Thereupon the Emperor. Majesty let herself be heard: she wants to take it into consideration. Some had advised that it should be reported to the Emperor. Majesty by impartial doctors. But some high potentates, who are crepuscular and hostile in all matters, have prevented it. 

In two days a Spaniard was beheaded here because he had stabbed another Spaniard the night before. When he knelt down, he asked them to say the Lord's Prayer to comfort him, and whoever wanted to do so should lift a finger. All the servants who were present would have done this. After that, he also asked that several masses be said for him, 


2) "Kept" will be as much as: Stopped. 3) Walch: "to please": 


3276 


No one wanted to lift a finger, but some said aloud: "Measurement is no longer valid. 

66 Our counterpart also undertook to let the embassy of the Duke of Julich, a count, out of their council, but he found himself. Mainz sometimes did not want to be present, because they had thus arranged it through each other, as one stately says. 

On Friday, St. Kilian's Day, my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, visited King Ferdinand before noon, and helped to request the fiefs for Margrave Georgen of Brandenburg. 

68 The legend is that Imperial Majesty also required the Swiss. Majesty also required the Swiss, and it says that Zwinge, Oecolampad, Capito, Hedio, Butzer are also hereditary. 

| cannot write how stiff-necked, mad and foolish the Sacrament enthusiasts are, both man and woman, young and old, and everything that is only tainted with this poison. Yesterday, Friday after the Visitationis Maria, a rich citizen here in Augsburg told me in private that more than half the city, indeed three parts of rich and poor, men and women, maids and servants, are attached to Master Michel, 1) that is, to the Zwinglian doctrine, and where something should happen to him or the doctrine, that nothing good will come of it. 

70. on friday Kiliani, here in Augsburg, this following opinion was written in Latin in our inn, in the evening. The twenty doctors, reported above, have today decided their answer and say: that the Lutheran princes in the twenty-one articles hold almost all Christian, but their doctors have taught differently, as they presented to imperial majesty. The above- mentioned doctors do not contest both forms much; the priests' marriage and the mass more vehemently. One does not write it all on a whole book of paper. Tomorrow they will begin to rewrite it, because it has been compiled by many. They almost boast that they want to preserve the Roman See and the Church very well. Kais. Majesty has requested that they no longer delay Her Imperial Majesty. Majesty with it any longer and hand it over; which they promised they would do in three days. 

A pious, well-known man wrote this to our inn. If this is the case, our counterpart has not yet submitted his articles; therefore, the Emperor's Majesty has not yet been able to give us an answer. Majesty has not yet been able to give us an answer. So it leaks from one house to the other. Therefore, it is no wonder that these matters are talked about unequally and strangely among you and everywhere.

One of them asked the Legate and Cardinal Campegium to help the cause of the Gospel to peace, when he answered: because the Pope's power was suspicious of us, the matter was in the will of the Emperor and the German princes; what they would do, it would turn out. 

On Saturday after St. Kilian's Day, the ninth of July, 2) early before noon, at the City Hall, Duke Frederick of Bavaria, in addition to Count Hoyer of Mansfeld and Count von Helfenstein, on behalf of Imperial Majesty, 3) requested my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, and the other princes, who are attached to the Gospel, to indicate whether they wanted to leave it at the articles presented, or bring in more articles, so that, where one will take up the matter, there will be no hindrance. As a backtrack is requested, in view of the fact that the cities, pending to them, were not present, as namely, Nuremberg and Reutlingen. 

The answer, given to it, was Christian, and thus put (praise to God) that one did not give anything to the cause, presented in writings on Sundays after Kiliani, with diligent request to promote the things; God grant the prosperity to it, amen. 

His Imperial Majesty had his Spanish masters discuss how his Majesty should oppose the Lutheran doctrine. To this they have given Emperor Maj. Maj. in the French language with this reply: Where His Imperial Majesty finds such pieces in it. Majesty finds such pieces in it that are contrary to the articles of faith, then his Majesty shall use all her power to exterminate the same souls. If, however, the disputed articles concern only the removal of certain ceremonies and external matters, His Majesty shall not oppose them vehemently. But to learn this, His Majesty shall submit the matters to some less pious people who are not related to any part. This is a fine, prudent, wise council, the like of which we would certainly have found hard to find in all German lands. 

Cardinal Campegius said to one of them: "| have often thought that the innumerable multitude of monks will one day cause great misfortune to the Church.

The fact that the other side of the coin is so tough is not surprising enough. 

Count Felix von Werdenberg, such a great adversary of Doctor Martin Luther that he is said to have let himself be heard: if it came to war against the Lutherans, that he would let himself be used for it in vain, panketted with the Abbot of Weingarten on Monday after St. Kilian's Day, and went away drunk, and was found dead in bed, and buried on Tuesday after St. Kilian's Day. God forgive him his sin. In this way, one after the other passes away. We still act as if we wanted to push Christ out of heaven. 

79 Tuesday after Kiliani, the twelfth of the month of hay, our adversary answered their answer to our faith and doctrine confession of imperial majesty. 1) The monks wanted to kiss the feet of the emperor; he did not want that. Now we want to know and hear, if God wills, how it will sound; God grant everywhere with grace, amen. Let us only pray and ask faithfully, and stand in the fear of God and faith, amen. 

How highly the Gegengentheil embittered the matter appears in part from these Germanized articles: 

In the year after Christ's birth, fifteen hundred and thirty, on the thirteenth of July, the Emperor's Majesty delivered up some Christian doctors. Majesty, at the Imperial Diet of Augsburg, several Christian doctors delivered books, as their titles subsequently read: 

A Christian and urgent response to the articles submitted [at this Imperial Diet in Augsburg] by the Elector of Saxony and several other princes and two cities.

It is said that when Count Felix von Werdenberg was carried to his grave, an honest citizen here in Augsburg stood before a prince's council, and when he saw the corpse, with more pomp than usual, he asked: who the dead man was? When he heard that it was Count Felix, he was terrified and said: "God is a strange judge; yesterday | heard from his mouth that he had spoken with dire words: he did not want to live, he wanted to put his life and property into eradicating the Lutheran doctrine; then he went away so shortly. Now it is said that he was not drunk either. 

Another count experienced this, who also opposed God's word so much, even with such defiance, that he was also said to be so frightened that he became ill from it. 

The suffragan bishop of Wurzburg, Marius, often said in a collation: he wanted to stay with the mother, he meant the papal church. Brentius, as a pious, learned man, once said: "Dear Lord, you must not forget the Father, the dear God, in addition; then the suffragan bishop wanted to fly off the handle. 

85. praise god, we have daily much good company of highly respected, pious, learned people, from all lands almost. 

The committee of this Diet are Duke George of Saxony, Duke William of Bavaria, Duke Albrecht of Mechelburg, Chancellor of the Margrave of Baden, Doctor Vehus, the Bishop of Wurzburg, Augsburg, Speier. 

Here, they had expelled some preacher monks, who were in charge of Mainz, from the churches, because they were suspicious of God's word; but they had to allow it again. They make a mess of the dear Lord Christ and his tender gospel. 

On Thursday after Margaret the Emperor's Majesty asked the princes, princes and estates of the empire what they thought about how the matters concerning God's word should be carried out and dealt with, and the estates let themselves be heard honestly, praise God.

94 They say that our counterpart, the doctors, have made their transfer to our confession so dubious, violent and ugly that the Emperor himself said it was too ugly and ordered them to make their transfer more gentle.

The schoolmaster did not want to suffer this, they disagreed about it, so hard that they hit each other, so that the schoolmaster was beaten to death under it; and when the Trabant was very wounded, he turned back to Augsburg. The schoolmaster's wife followed him and made such a fuss that the boy was taken to prison and will not be there long, of course; this boy is supposed to be a nobleman.

On the fifth day of January, all the princes of the empire, except Saxony, elected Ferdinandum, King of Bohemia and Hungary, at Cologne and proclaimed him King of Rome. And Emperor Carl, together with their Imperial Maj. Maj. brother, King Ferdinand, and all princes and rulers departed from Cologne and went to Aach; there, on the 11th day of January, King Ferdinand was elected Roman king. King Ferdinandus was crowned Roman King, and their royal dignity, election and coronation by Emperor Caroln was published and announced in writing to all states of the Empire. 

In the month of March, on the 29th day, a day is again scheduled at Schmalkalden, where the protesting estates will meet to consult with each other about the opposition and protection if they should be overrun by the papists for the sake of the doctrine of the Gospel. 

In this year, Martin Luther printed a gloss on the imperial edict issued after the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530. Item, a beautiful, Christian warning to his dear Germans, set on the 





This is the case when the enemies of the divine word and the church wanted to overrun the Protestant states by war; with which two books the papists are very enraged. 

In the month of June, the protesting estates held a day at Frankfurt am Main; on the same day, Prince Palatine Ludwig and the Archbishop of Mainz, Albrecht, Cardinal, offered to take a peaceful action between the Imperial Majesty and the Catholic or papist estates, and thereafter also the protesting estates, and to be mediators so that no part of 1) the other does anything violent. On the same day, the Elector Palatine Ludwig and Albrecht Cardinal of Main offered to carry out a peaceful act between the Imperial Majesty and the Catholic or papist estates, and then also the protesting estates, and to act as mediator so that no part should have to do anything wrong to the other, and the act was carried out ona special day in Schmalkalden last August, but little fruitful was achieved and obtained. 

In the month of March, the Elector of Trier, Richard Barnklau, a wise and peaceful prince, died to the sorrow of many. 

After there had long been great disagreement between the thirteen nations in Switzerland over religion, a war broke out in the month of October in Switzerland, so that the five papist places, Lucerne, Uri and others, declared themselves hostile to those of Bern and Zurich. Because the Protestant places did not want to give them salt or grain, they immediately went into battle against them and on the 11th day of October attacked and assaulted the Zurichers, also putting them to flight at a monastery called Capell [Kappel] and strangling them in the 1500s. In this skirmish or battle, Huldricus Zwinglius, chief preacher at Zurich, perished in the 44th year of his age, since he had gone out with the Zurichers as their field preacher and was found in the attack. After this defeat of the Zurichers, they again armed themselves and sought help from the city of Bern, and brought together about thirty thousand men, divided their warband into two groups, and marched the Zurichers on Zug, but the Berners on Lucerne; since the Confederates attacked the Berners with a force of eighteen thousand men, and on the 18th day of October drove them back again, and cut off a thousand and two hundred men, and drowned a thousand men in water. 

(7) When the people of Zurich and Bern were again gathered together and received more help than from Basel and Schafhausen, they attacked their enemies once again on October 24 and were again defeated and lost six thousand men.

that they should not mix the names of the princes in their books and writings. 

In this 1533rd year, Emperor Carol's and Pope Clement's message was also sent to Germany to the Elector of Saxony and the protesting estates for the sake of the Concilii. For after the Turk fled from Austria in the thirty-second year, Emperor Carol went to Italy against the winter, and held deliberations with Pope Clement at Bononia on how a concilium should be held in the German land, and how the division of religion should be abolished thereby. Thereupon the same legates departed, met the Elector of Saxony, Duke John Frederick, at Weimar, and announced the concilium of His Lordship there, which was to be held perhaps at Placenza, Bononia, or Mantua. 

The Elector then described the protesting estates to Schmalkalden at the end of the fallow month and discussed with them an answer to be given to the legates. 

7. in this year king Henry of England has pushed away his wife, queen Catharina, emperor Carol's wife, and has taken another queen, called Anna Boleyn?) who in this 1533. year has born him a daughter in the month of September, who has been called Elizabeth. 

8. so one has seen also from the month Julio to the August moons, at 11 days, a comet. 


Anno 1534 to 1537. 


The narratives for these four years can be found in the locations indicated immediately before. 


Anno 1534. 


1) In this year 2) King Henry of England has pushed away his wife Catharina, King Ferdinand's daughter in Hispania, who had previously married his brother, King Arthurum, and Pope Julius has dispensed with this, that King Henry may have his deceased brother's wife in marriage. Since she now had only one daughter, called Mary, the king wanted to have another free one, called Anna Boleyn, and for this he sought Pope Clement's permission and consent. 


1) Walch: "Bolonia". 

2) In contradiction with § 7 of the previous section. In 1533, Henry VIIIl was married to Anna Boleyn when she was already pregnant by him, but without being divorced from his first wife Catharina.

He was not badly inclined to the other marriage at first, but for the sake of Emperor Carl he became changeable again and condemned King Henry's other marriage altogether. Then the king sent to all the universities in France, Italy and German lands, and had the learned people bring Judicia and Censuras in this marriage matter. The English legates, a bishop and Doctor Antonius Barns, were also in Wittenberg with Doctor Martin Luther, Philippo Melanchthon and the other theologians. 

Because King Henry of England was hostile to Pope Clementi for this reason, he deprived the pope of his annual income, the St. Peter's penny, because every house in the kingdom of England had to give the pope a silver penny. This year the pope was deprived of several tons of gold, and his regiment was driven out of Engelland. And the king let himself be called the head of the church in England and did not want to let the pope be the head of the churches on earth anymore. 

In this year, Martin Luther also printed a booklet about the Mass of the Holy Angles, which greatly angered the papists. 

4 So also in this year between D. M. Luthero and Erasmo Roterodamo a new noise arose about the doctrine of free will; which caused a letter Lutheri wrote to Nie. Amsdorf, which went out in print; on it Erasmus again had a hard booklet printed. 

5. landgrave Philip of Hesse has gone in this year in great war armor and [has] gone to the Wirtemberger land, and Duke Ulrich of Wurtemberg (who was chased out of the Swabian League, and at 11 years in exile) by money help of King Francisci of France reinstated in his country, and the King Ferdinand! King Ferdinand's army, which was 12,000 strong, was put to flight, and this army's commander, 3) Count Palatine Philip, had a heel (Fersche) on his leg shot off in the battle. 

6th And when a great noise was about to be made in German lands, the Archbishop of Mainz, Elector, and Duke George of Saxony, the Landgrave's brother-in-law, entered into negotiations between King Ferdinand and the Landgrave, and agreed on this war on the day of Caden in Bohemia.

7 The Anabaptists also did great harm with their false teachings in the Netherlands, especially in Westphalia, and especially took the city of Munster, where a tailor named John of Leyden proclaimed himself king. When the king of Leyden stopped in the city and sent twelve prophets to seduce other cities in the vicinity, and there was great violence with much womanizing, rioting, plundering, and chasing away of pious people, the bishop of Munster besieged the very strong and rich city and built blockhouses in front of it. But when he could not bear this heavy cost of war for a long time, he appealed to the estates of the Roman Empire for help, which came together at Worms and granted the help, and besieged the city for longer than a whole year, and finally entered it by treachery, and strangled all that was male and able to defend it. The king and two of his most prominent princes, called Krechting and Knipperdolling, were imprisoned and in the following 36th year torn apart with fiery pincers and hanged in three iron pawns at the top of the gate, and thus hung in eternal memory of all rebels. 

8 In this 1534th year Pope Clement died in September, and Paul Ill became Pope, and although he was very old when he became Pope, yet he reigned 15 years. 

In this year King Frederick also died in Denmark, and Christianus, his eldest son, became king in his father's place and won the kingdom with the sword, and for this reason waged a great war with the imperial city of Lbeck. 

10th Also, Andreas Criti has become this year Duke of Venice. 

(11) The Turk also took great damage this year from Sophi in Persia, called Thamas; for he struck him twice hard, and laid down fifteen thousand on horseback, thirty thousand on foot, and in the eighteen thousand camels. 


Anno 1535. 


In this 1535th year Peter Paul Vergerius was sent by Pope Paul Ill to the German country for the sake of the Concilium, to announce a general, free Concilium, which was to be held in Mantua; for this reason he first came to the court of the Roman king Ferdinandi, and because Landgrave Philip of Hesse was there in the Wirtemberg matter, the papal legate reported his advertisement to the Landgrave of Hesse at that time. 


2nd And after Duke John Frederick, Elector of Saxony, traveled to Vienna in Austria to the Roman King Ferdinand, and there received the fiefs, and performed other things more, and on the return trip to his Electorate of Saxony, he was able to visit Ferdinand. Gn. In Prague, in Bohemia, Peter Paulus Vergerius came to his electoral grace. Grace, and by his Elector's Grace he received his advertisement and order of the Concord. He then sent this Petrine to his electoral grace in Prague in Bohemia. And afterwards this Petrus Paulus Vergerius also traveled to Wittenberg, and was located at the castle, and D. Martinum Luthern and Philippum Melanchthonem himself. 

The protesting estates then arranged a meeting at Schmalkalden, where all the churals and princes, as well as imperial cities, of the same unity, met in the month of December and discussed and acted for the sake of the council. On this Schmalkaldic Day, King Francis of France also sent his legate, as Guilielmum Bellajum Langaum, to the protesting estates. This legate conversed a great deal with the theologians of the protesting estates about the most important articles and main points of Christian doctrine, and indicated what his king's opinion and that of many of his followers in France would be, as they would also like to know how to control even the Pope's assumed great power and many abuses; and that the king of France desired nothing better than that the protesting estates send some of their followers in France, who conferred and conversed with his theologians about doctrine. In particular, the king wrote to Philipp Melanchthon that he should come to him in France. But the Elector of Saxony, Duke John Frederick, would not allow him to do so. In addition, the King of France sought and desired that the protesting estates would not consent to any place where a concilium might be held without the King of France's and the King of England's prior knowledge. And it may well have been sought there that the protesting estates should include the King of France in their union of kinship; but this was refused to the legate. 

On this Schmalkaldic Day, King Henry VIII of England also sent his legates and informed the Estates how he had eradicated the Antichrist, the Pope's, regiment from his kingdom and was well disposed toward the Christian doctrine of the Gospel, and warned them against the Pope's practices of the Conciliar, and offered to stand beside the protesting Estates in the Conciliar. 


3292 


On this Schmalkaldic Day, the princes of Pomerania, Duke Ulrich of Wurtemberg, Count Palatine Ruprecht, the city of Augsburg, Frankfurt, Compodunum [Kempten], Hamburg and Hanover entered into the protesting agreement; item, Count Wilhelm of Nassau was also accepted into the agreement. 

6 And after there had been great division in Augsburg over the doctrine of the Lord's Supper for some time, this was settled, and the council of Augsburg sent a legate to D. Mart. Luthern against Wittenberg a legate, as D. Gereon, 1) and requested in writing that they have Urbanum Regium again as their preacher. But D. Luther did not obtain him from Duke Ernsten of LUneburg (over whose principality he was a superintendent). 

In this 1535th year, in the month of June, Emperor Carol departed from Hispania with a mighty armor from Barchinon 2) to Africa, and won the kingdom of Tunis, in which the old famous city of Carthage was located. And this kingdom was taken by force from the Turkish emperor Solimanno, and the king Altzachens 3) (whom the Turk had driven out and expelled) was reinstated in the kingdom of Tunis by Emperor Carln; was again shipped from Africa into Italy, and was introduced to Rome with great triumph. 

In this year Christianus, King of Denmark, ruled after the death of his father, King Frederick, and waged a fierce war against the imperial city of Lubeck. In this year, after the death of his father, King Frederick, Christianus reigned, and against the imperial city of Lubeck, which had waged a fierce war over this kingdom, he conquered the kingdom with the sword and won the city of Copenhagen by force, which Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg had held. After his coronation, King Christian began to plant the Christian religion of the Augsburg Confession throughout his kingdom. 

At the end of this 35th year, the last Duke of Milan, Franciscus Sfortia, died without heirs, who had Miss Christierna, King Christierna of Denmark's daughter, in marriage, who was subsequently married to Duke Francisco of Lorraine. The King of France wanted to inherit this principality, over which great wars arose between Emperor Carol and King Francisco of France.

10th Duke Carl of Sophoy [Savoy] is also overrun by the King of France, and the city of Bern in Switzerland, and taken from him by force the Piedmont and almost all his lands. 

(11) So also the dolphin [Dauphin] in France, Franciscus, died, and as it is thought, fo was forgiven him with poison. 

This whole year the Anabaptists have been besieged in the city of Munster, and also won and captured. 


Anno 1536. 


In the month of January, the Queen of England Catharina, who had repudiated King Henry, died. So in the month of May, the other new queen, Anna Bolena, was beheaded with other her friends, who were distinguished English lords. And in a few days after that, King Henry married the third wife, Jane Seymour. 4) After that a war of the subjects against the king followed in England, that the Englishmen rose to 50,000 strong, did not want to tolerate the great assessment and other troubles any longer, but by deceit and a sham treaty this rebellion was quenched, and many great lords, who had been in the subjects’ camp, were beheaded afterwards by the king. 

In the month of February, the Bishop of Munster came to the city of Munster with the Elector of Cologne and the Duke of Julich, and had the King of Munster and his two princes judged. The king converted to the Lord Christ, and when he was torn apart with fiery tongs, he died a Christian death. But the other two princes, Knipperdolling and Krechting, remained obdurate and were hanged in three iron baskets outside the gate. 

3 Thus a great war arose between Emperor Carolo and King Francisco of France, and the Emperor attacked the French hard in Gallia Narbonensi and in Picardia, but did little. 

4 King Henry of England also sent his embassy, as a bishop and Doctor Antonium Barns, to Wittenberg, and with the theologians there, as, D. Martin Luther, Philippo Melanchthon and others, had them discuss and act on the main points of Christian doctrine, and especially on the mass, priestly marriage and the Lord's Supper, and the monks' vows, and they remained there for several months. They have also heard about the divorcio [divorce] of the first queen with

He also took great pains with the Elector of Saxony, Duke John Frederick, to have their king admitted to the Schmalkaldic League. 

5th Thereupon the protesting estates announced a day on the 24th day of April at Frankfurt on the Main, where they dealt with the relatives of these English matters. On this day Duke Ulrich of Wirtemberg, Duke Barnim and Duke Philipp of Pomerania, Prince Georg and Joachim of Anhalt, brothers, the city of Augsburg, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Hanover were accepted into the Schmalkaldic League. 

On the 11th day of June, Pope Paul Ill sent a letter to Emperor Charles and all the imperial states, announcing the concilium to be held in Mantua on the 3rd day of May in the 37th year. 

The Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann, a Count of Wied, 1) began in this year to advise how the idolatry and ungodly ceremonies in the Abbey of Cologne might be abolished; as then in the following years their Electoral Grace took much and great action for this reason, and adopted the Augsburg Confession, and also brought about a Reformation; but in the end was deprived of the Archbishopric. 

In the month of July, the highly respected man, Erasmus Roterodamus, died in Basel. 

9 In this 1536th year, on the 21st day of May, some of the preachers of the cities of Upper Austria came to Luther in Wittenberg as Martinus Bucerus, Wolfgangus Capito, Martinus Frecht, and others. M. Luther to Wittenberg, as Martinus Bucerus, Wolfgangus Capito, Martinus Frecht, and others, and in the doctrine of the Holy Communion hurriedly established concordia and comparison, and of other articles of doctrine also conversed and compared, and in the doctrine of the Holy Communion united the church at Strasbourg, Ulm, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Memmingen, and Reutlingen with the Wittenberg church.

1. in 1537 the daughter of King Francisci of France, Magdalena, was married to the King of Scotland, Jacobs V., and this king died in the month of May in this 1537th year.

All the states have been described for the sake of the Concilii and the sovereigns and princes, also the cities, have brought their most distinguished theologians with them, as D. Mart. Luthern, Philippum Melanchthonem, D. Pomeranum, Martinum Bucerum, Andream Osiandrum, and others in large numbers. On this day, Emperor Carln sent Matthias Held, Vice- Chancellor, to the protesting Estates, who, on account of the Imperial Majesty, took great action with the Estates; the Pope also sent his legation there for the sake of the Concilii. 

3. on this day were in own person: Duke John Frederick, Elector, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, Duke Ernst and Francis, Princes of Lineburg, Duke Ulrich of Wiurtemberg, Duke Philip of Pomerania, Prince Wolf, George and Joachim of Anhalt, Count Gebhard and Count Albrecht of Mansfeld, and the envoys of the imperial cities in large numbers, and on the 6th day of March the electors and princes, as well as the envoys of the imperial cities, departed from this day. 

The theologians also discussed on this day with the utmost seriousness and diligence what they finally wanted to base and maintain in the Concilio, and several articles, as a summary of Christian doctrine, were written by D. Martin Luther, and approved by all the theologians assembled there, and signed with their own hand; which booklet then went out in public print in the 38th year, and was called the Schmalkaldic Articles. 

5 The theologians were also ordered by the sovereigns and princes on this day to read through the Augsburg Confession and Apology (delivered by Emperor Carln at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg in 1530) again with diligence, and if anything was found in it that was not in accordance with the holy divine Scriptures, or if they did not teach such things in their churches, to change it, and they, the theologians, signed the Confession and Apology again with their own hand. This signature was done on the 24th day of Februarii. And especially Martinus Bucerus signed the Augsburg Confession and Apology on behalf of the preaching ministry and churches in Strasbourg. 

6 On this day D. Mart. Luther was deathly ill at the stone in Schmalkalden, and so he was taken sick from there to Gotha; and as he was brought to the Thuringian Forest in the village of Tambach, the urine (to speak with breeding) left him again, which he otherwise could not let go in many days,

and immediately got better weakness. This caused great joy on the day in Schmalkalden; otherwise, all the princes and sovereigns, as well as the cities’ envoys and theologians, would have been in great distress and grief over Luther's weakness. All the lords and princes visited him in person and comforted him, because they were very worried that he would die there. 

7 There was also a recusantation against the concilium in Mantua, in which causes were raised by the princes and chieftains as to why they could not attend the concilium. And after Duke Frederick of Mantua occupied the city with troops, the pope wrote to the imperial estates and postponed the concilium until the month of November; the king of England also had a document printed against the concilium and apologized why he did not want to send his envoys to the concilium in Mantua. 

8 This year another great war has begun between the Emperor and the King of France; and although the Imperial Maj. Maj. remained in Hispania all this year, his warlords, Count Henry of Nassau, the Lord of Boer, and others, attacked the King of France in Picardia, also won the city and castle of St. Paul, and there finally obtained peace and peace for 10 months. But the war in Piedmont continued with all force, and the King of France dispatched his eldest son Henricum with a great army of the end, and relieved and saved the city of Morin from the imperial siege, also won Susa (Zuza) and Moncallir [Moncalieri], and prevented that in this year Emperor Carl's army in Piedmont accomplished little. It is also Antoni de Leva, the Imperial Maj. Maj.'s chief of war, died in this campaign. 

The city of Augsburg also abolished the mass and other papal abominations and idolatries this year, and planted the doctrine of the Gospel in its churches. A dispute arose in the city, and many of the nobility and families left Augsburg and sued the city council before the Emperor and King Ferdinand. 

(10) The Turkish Emperor Solimanns also sent a war party into Croatia this year and besieged a city there; on the other hand, the Roman King Ferdinand raised a war party of Austrians, Bohemians, Meisseners, Saxons, Franks and other countries and sent them to the besieged city to relieve it. But the same German warriors are badly led.

In the month of October, the Queen of England, Jane Seymour, gave birth to a young gentleman named Edward, who died the 12th day after. 

12 Thus also Pope Paul Ill at Rome had the Cardinals advise on a reformation of the Roman court, which subsequently went out in public print, and D. Martyrs' Day. Mart. Luther made a preface to it in the 1538th year, and scholiiret this reformation. And on the same booklet was printed this figure and picture: that the pope sits on a chair, and the cardinals had made besem of fox tails, with which they sweep the cobwebs out of the church. 

In this 1537th year, King Christian of Denmark wrote to Wittenberg, requesting V. Johann Bugenhagen, Pomeranian, to be sent to Denmark to plant the teaching of the divine word there and to reform the churches. With the permission of the Elector of Saxony, Duke John Frederick, Pomeranus departed in the month of June and remained in Denmark until his thirty-ninth year. Luther preached in his place at Wittenberg on Sundays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. On Wednesdays he interpreted several chapters of Matthew, from the eighteenth to the twenty-fourth, and on Saturdays he preached the Gospel of John, beginning with the first chapter and ending with the fourth chapter.

In that year, a book arrived in Germany from Italy about the reformation that the pope wanted to carry out in the church. Before it, Luther made a preface and sketched the contents of the book with a painting. For there were several cardinals around the pope, who sat on a high throne, sweeping everything above and below with fox tails tied to long poles as with brooms.

Denmark, which in. Person also came there, excluded into the covenant. This king Christianus, Friderici's son, accepted the evangelical doctrine, and received from Wittenberg D. Johannem  Bugenhagen Pomeranum, who traveled in Denmark, established churches and schools there, and also consecrated the king for government. 

In France they continued to persecute the evangelicals, as in Paris a noble youth from Tolosa [Toulouse], a student, was burned for eating meat, after first being suffocated with a rope. 

The school at Strasbourg increased greatly, as many Germans and foreigners went there, and Sturmius gave instructions on how to arrange the lectures. The persecuted from France and the Netherlands settled there, and the city council gave them a church there, and Johannes Calvinus was the exiled preacher for a while. 

There also arose the sect of the lawbreakers who did not want to admit that repentance should be taught from the Ten Commandments. Their most distinguished originator was Johannes Agricola, Islebius, who recognized his error upon Luther's reminder. 

Thus the Archbishops of Mainz and Salzburg, the Dukes of Bavaria, Wilhelm and Ludwig, Duke George of Saxony, the Dukes of Brunswick, Erich and Heinrich, made a covenant at Nuremberg, which they’ called the holy covenant, to protect and defend the old religion, as they said. Lutherus continued in explanation of the first book of Moses, and wrote to good friends, as his letters in Tomo III Epistol. Lutheri 1) in this year.

This report, as well as the stories that belong to the following years until your death of Luther, has made Joh. Christfried Sagittarius, the editor of the Alteuburg edition of the works of Luther. Printed in the Altenburg edition, vol. VII, p. 401; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXI, p.441 and in Walch, vol. XXI, 97". 


In February of this year, a meeting was held at Frankfurt, and among other things, a colloquium was held among scholars on the subject of the religious dispute. The Elector of Saxony was there in person, and had with him Philippum Melanchthonem, as his letter from Frankfurt to Lutherum and D. Justum Jonam,

which is described in Tom. III. Epistol. Lutheri. Finally, a peace or standstill was made, and it was stipulated that for the sake of religion no state should be overreached or denied justice in the courts. On April 24, Duke George of Saxony, a very zealous advocate of the papal doctrine and Luther's worst enemy, died. He made a will and appointed as heirs his brother Heinricum and his sons Mauricium and Augustum; but with this condition, that in the lands they would receive, they should not change anything in religion; and as far as they would do so, the Emperor Carolus and Ferdinandus, the Roman king, should have the lands until the brother, his sons, or a close relative liked such a condition. He presented this will to the knighthood and the estates, and requested that they take an oath that they would not cede it. They, on the other hand, asked their princely grace to allow a legation to be sent to their brother, hoping that their princely grace would agree that nothing should be changed in the old religion. When the envoys arrived, they presented many reasons to their princely graces. Especially that there was a lot of cash, a lot of supplies, and a lot of silver. All this would come to their princely graces if they would only accept the money. Grace, if only they would be willing to help their lord brother. Whereupon their Princely Grace Without taking some time to think about it, Duke Henry immediately said: "Truly, your legation is doing to me exactly what we read about in the Holy Scriptures, when Satan promised Christ kingdoms to the whole world if he would only fall down and worship him. Do you think that | should esteem some wealth and fortune so highly that | would for the sake of it renounce the recognized truth and pure religion? In this you are far wrong. Now that the sent ones went away again without having achieved anything, Duke George died before they came home again. But Duke Henry immediately had Dresden and the other cities pay homage to him. And so Duke George had an heir, against his will; and Luther, whom Duke George fiercely opposed, was summoned to Leipzig by Duke Henry, who preached there, and made a start in the Reformation. The sermon is in this  Hallische Sammlung in the XII. Th., p. 1832. 2) In this year Luthe

The favorable reader will find in the historical report of the following 1540th year how also Philippus Melanchthon was deathly ill from great grief and sorrow at Weimar, and was again requested by God through Luther.

In this year, Prince John Frederick required Philippus Melanchthon from Wittenberg to Weimar because of the above-mentioned Colloquii at Hagenau. This Philippus had agreed, at someone's request, that a well-known prince from the protesting estates of that time may have two wives at once. Afterwards, Melanchthon was very angry about this, and because he noted that he would fall into a serious and fatal illness, he made a will in Wittenberg before his departure, which can be found in the Consiliis Philippi compiled by D. Christophorus Pezelius. When Philippus now traveled to Weimar, he fell into a great illness there out of shear courage. | want to tell this, how in the written Lebeuslaufe Lutheri, which is held in his Serene Highness, Duke Ernst of Gotha, my most gracious prince and lord, Bibliotheca, and for Spalatini hand, it is distinguished.

When he arrived, he found the matter as it had been told, and found Philippum in his final throes. His eyes were broken, his mind gone, his speech lost, his hearing gone, his face and temples sunken, and he knew no one and ate and drank nothing. At this sight, Lutherus was violently frightened, turned to the companions of his journey, and said: "God forbid, how the devil has desecrated this organon for me.

After this he took Philippe by the hand (for he knew well about the sorrow of his heart and conscience) and said: "Be of good cheer, Philippe, you will not die. Even though God has cause to die, he does not want the sinner to die, but to be converted and to live. He desires life and not death. Because God called and accepted into His grace the greatest sinners who ever lived on earth, namely Adam and Evam, much less does He want to reject you, Philip, or admit that you perish in your sin and melancholy. Therefore do not give place to the spirit of sorrow, and do not become your own murderer, but rely on the Lord, who is able to kill and to make alive. When Luther spoke this, Philip came back to life, as it were, and began to draw breath, regained his strength, and regained his former health. 

This illness of his, and what he encounters in it, is commemorated by Philip himself in a letter to Joachimum Camerarium. The Latin words are to be read in the Consiliis Philippi, published by D. Pezelius, which in German read approximately thus: | cannot express it, what terrible afflictions | felt, which sometimes find themselves again. | noticed that Doctor Luther was also very anxious about it; but he did not let his grief be noticed so that it would not increase mine.

In a letter to Burcardum Mithobium 1) Philip writes about this: "| received your letters, which you sent this summer: the first in Schmalkalden; the other in Thuringia, since | was afflicted with a terrible illness, which only originated from a sorrow and grief, which a foreign trade had brought to me, about which you also complain. | would have died if | had not been snatched from the midst of death by Luther's arrival. 

Mr. Mathesius writes about this: 2) This summer, Mr. Melanchthon went to Weimar, where he falls into a great illness, that everyone despairs of his life. Thereupon our doctor is hurriedly summoned, who comforts him and raises him up, as he says afterwards: "| have begged our Philippum, and my Kathe, and the Ern Myconium from death. Which Mecum also finally asked the doctor to stop crying for him. 3) 

In March a meeting was held at Schmalkalden, where Granvellanus sent the two counts Dietrichen von Manderscheid 4) and Wilhelmen de Nova Aquila [of Neuenaar] as negotiators. The talk was very much inclined to peace and unity, however, they thought besides, kaiserl. Majesty Carolus V. was in these thoughts, as if the protesters had no desire for unity, and were only concerned with how they could take possession of the spiritual goods. But the protesters replied to this in a special document. What else happened, Philip reported to Luther. He replied: one must take recourse to prayer, which alone, as he writes, would be omnipotens imperatrix [the almighty empress]. 

On June 25, the convention at Hagenau began, where the theologians Justus Menius, Urbanus Regius, Brentius, Osiander, Snepfius, and many others came. Philip was kept away because of his illness. Ferdinandus, the Roman king, called another meeting at Worms because of the absence of the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, so nothing special happened at Hagenau. The protesters stuck to the Confession, presented at Augsburg in 1530, and its Apologia.

In October, the convention in Worms began, and finally, on January 13, 1541, it was decided that each part should select a learned man who could publicly discuss the disputed articles in the Augsburg Confession with the other. The protesters chose Philippum. The opponents proposed D. Ecken. On the part of the protesters, D. Caspar Cruciger and Wolfgangus Musculus were appointed notaries and scribes, who were to record everything faithfully and diligently at the colloquium. In several letters, Philippus attributed to Luther what happened in Worms that year, to which Luther also replied. This is memorable, that at Worms the protesting theologians divided the old church teachers among themselves and read through them, so that they could confront the papists in all ways. Luther meanwhile continued with the explanation of the first book of Moses, and had the Jobum, Psalter, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon, Esaiam and Jeremiam printed in German, as he commemorates in a letter to Phillppum in Worms: Speramus te et Caeparum (Crucigerum) percurrisse Novum Testamentum. Nos sine vobis ausi sumus lob, Psalterium, Proverbia, Ecclesiasten, Cantica, Esaiam, leremiam tradere typis [| hope that you and Caspar (Cruciger) have read through the New Testament.

The colloquium held last year at Worms finally began on January 13, and before January 2 the papal authorities proposed new and unusual conditions, namely that only two theologians should be chosen from all of them to discuss religious matters with each other; the notaries should write it down and hand it over to the presidents; the lesser part should not be required to accept the greater or greater part's opinion unless the emperor and the estates decided that it should be done. Not all speeches of the collocutorum should be written out by the notaries, but only the mere opinions; they should be settled or remain in dispute. What was decided at Augsburg and elsewhere should not apply. The protesters, however, objected: Because on both sides to the Colloquio twoand

The Council of Princes, consisting mostly of bishops, rejected the book given by Granvellano and the whole action of the Colloquii. The protesters handed over a document to the Emperor, declaring that they would stick to the Augsburg Confession and reminding him of the extent to which the state of the Church could be destroyed again. The emperor consulted with Contareno, the pope's envoy, who suggested that because the protesters were leaving the church in some doctrines, and there was still hope that they would consider another, he thought it advisable to stand and bring the whole matter to the pope, who would then observe by a public concilium or in some other way what would be useful to the whole church, especially to Germany. The papal princes also agreed to this proposal, and thus the religious settlement was postponed until a general or national council in Germany. 

In this year Capito died in Strasbourg and Simon Grynaus in Basel. 

On December 13, King Ferdinand held a meeting at Prague, where the Austrian nobility, ten cities, including Vienna, and the neighboring cities in Styria and Carinthia, humbly requested that His Royal Majesty grant them the free exercise of religion. They have, however, been ordered to be patient until the above-mentioned concilio. 

Lutherus also wrote to Fridericum Myconium, pastor and superintendent at Gotha, who was fatally ill with consumption, as Myconius had informed Luther: decumbere se quidem, non autem letaliter, sed vitaliter aegrotare (Dominica post Epiphanias) [he was lying down, but he was not sick to death, but to life (on Sunday after Epiphania)], among other things these thoughtful words: Vale, mi Friderice, et Dominus non sinat me audire tuum transitum, me vivo. Te superstitem faciat mihi hoc peto, hoc volo, et fiat mea voluntas, Arnen. Quia haec voluntas gloriam nominis Dei, certe non meam voluptatem, nec gloriam, quaerit. Which words are questionable, thus translated: The Lord will not let me hear, as long as | live, that you have died, but create that you survive me. This | ask earnestly, and it shall be granted, and so it shall be, and my will shall be done in this, amen. For this my will seeks the honor of the divine name, not my honor or pleasure. When Myconius read this letter of Luther, he felt as if he were hearing the voice of Christ.

heard: "Lazare, come out." He has also come to his health, as he widely remembers in two letters to M. Georgium Rorarium, then Diaconum at Wittenberg. God also heard Luther's prayer, for he died on February 18, Myconius on April 7, 1546, and thus the latter 7 weeks later.

In January of this year, an Imperial Diet was held at Speier by Ferdinandum, the Roman king, who had been commissioned by Emperor Carolus V to hold it. In this Diet, the war against the Turks was the main topic of discussion, which the French envoys, Franciscus Oliverius and the Chancellor Alenconius, did not entirely oppose, but considered it necessary that the estates of the Roman Empire meet in good confidence beforehand. However, since the war against the Turks had been decided, and the envoys realized that they were not very agreeable, they left in displeasure before the end of the Diet. The papal lenvoy, Johannes Moronus, argued that the pope, because of his age, could not hold the council in Germany, where he wanted and needed to be in person, and suggested the cities of Mantua, Ferrara, Bonomen, Placentiam, or, if none of them were acceptable, Trent. The Romanists finally liked this place, but the protesters rejected it completely. The Elector of Brandenburg, Margrave Joachim, was appointed general or field commander with the unanimous advice of the estates, including Imperial will. Maj. will, he was appointed general or commander for the forthcoming Turkish war. Such a move in Hungary was announced by Elector Luthero, who then informed His Electorate in a beautiful letter.

Because of this move, the Turkish tax has also been raised, and every local authority throughout Germany has been permitted to impose a tax on its subjects. When some Protestants also wanted to burden the church servants with the Turkish tax, Luther wrote a serious letter to a court preacher about it, which can be found below. The king in France announced war to Emperor Carin; prescribed a sharp form for his clergy, according to which those suspected in the Roman Catholic religion would have to be questioned. That summer, an exceedingly large number of locusts of unusual size passed through Germany and Italy.

The Emperor admonished Duke Georgen of Saxony to take the land from his brothers, Duke Heinrich, because he had adopted the Protestant religion. They also reported how much he thought of the papal religion, whose protector he wanted to be respected, was evident from his dealings with Even von der Trotte, with whom he had become involved in unseemly love, who had to pretend that she wanted to travel to her parents, and had left at one of his castles, since she had fallen ill, and afterwards it was claimed that she had died of the plague. He had her publicly buried in the chapel of the same castle and described the neighboring priests to the funeral procession; As he also ordered a funeral in Wolfenbittel, to which his wife, Frau Maria, Duke Ulrich's sister in Wirtemberg, attended in her own person with her maid with mourning clothes, to which many priests were called, and a funeral meal was given to them, and the Franciscans were publicly requested for the deceased for a whole year, and he persuaded the pious wife to make the death of Trott known to her close relatives. However, Eva would be fresh and healthy at Stauffenburg Castle, since she visited Duke Heinrich from time to time and fathered seven children with her. 

3 The Emperor Carolus V also made peace with the King of France in this year, against all expectations. 

4 Pope Paul Ill also wrote two letters to the emperor, complaining that he wanted to interfere in spiritual matters. He compared the emperor to the high priest Eli, who also gave in too much to his sons. Luther responded to these letters with the tract: "Against the papacy at Rome, founded by the devil." Luther also issued the "Brief Confession of Holy Communion" against the Sacramentarians, because they were spreading their poison further and further, and claimed that Luther would have agreed with them and would have established a concordiam and unity with them. As he writes about this in his confession: It is true that it has often been suggested to me before that the enthusiasts should boast that | am one with them; which | did not want to believe, because no one wanted to write it publicly about himself.

The clergy at Cologne also continued to hinder the reformation begun by Archbishop Hermann and to ask him to abolish Bucerum and other preachers. They also met at Cologne, and appealed to the pope at

3311 


Rome, and to the emperor, as the patron of the church. To this the archbishop replied that he had nothing to do with Luther and Bucero, but that he considered their doctrine, which was in accordance with the Holy Scriptures, to be quite apostolic, and such a doctrine as would be well worth accepting by all men. But when the clergy saw that they would not achieve much in this way, they called the other religious together again in Cologne in November and asked them to sign the appeal; those who refused, however, they stripped of their honors and sued the archbishop most vehemently before the emperor and the pope.

The theologians at Paris had let some conclusions go out from religion. These were followed by the theologians at Louvain, who wrote mere theses, numbering XXxXIl, but did not prove them by Scripture. Luther opposed them with others, teaching that they were heretics and bloodhounds who _ prescribed doctrines without Scripture, and incited the authorities to persecute with fire and sword those who would not subscribe to them. In France, the Waldenses, who did not recognize the pope for their head, and who had come to more knowledge through Luther's teachings, were persecuted bitterly and miserably, strangled without mercy, their cities, towns and villages burned, their women and virgins violated, and their little children rebaptized, as can be read in Sleidano with more. Cardinal Farnesius came from Rome to the Diet of Worms to provoke a war against the Lutherans, and the pope promised twelve thousand on foot and five hundred on horseback against them. So also at Worms, on the next Pentecost, a Franciscan monk, an Italian, preached a sermon in the presence of the emperor, Ferdinandi the Roman king, Farnesii the bishop of Augsburg, Granvellani, and others, and finally addressed the emperor thus: It is time, most great emperor, that you finally do your office. Truly, one has delayed long enough. The trade should have been completed long ago. God has blessed your Imperial Majesty with great benefits. Majesty with exceedingly great favors, and set her up as the

Granvellanus is said to have become very unwilling because of this incitement, either because he outwardly presented himself in this way, or because he realized that this would be a good warning to the protesters. 

At this time, Luther's book "Against the Papacy at Rome, Founded by the Devil" was published, in which he first responded to Pope Paul Ill's letter to Carolum V, in which he admonishes the Emperor from the care of religion, which belongs to him, the Pope. He then refutes the bogus reasons that are usually brought forward to support the Pope's sovereignty or primacy. How Duke Henry of Brunswick, a fierce enemy of the Lutherans, started a war against the Emperor's prohibition, and the Emperor took his land from him, but despite this, he, with the King's encouragement in France, recruited peoples again, and thus did great harm in the Bremen, Liineburg, and Brunswick lands, and finally had to surrender to the Landgrave of Hesse, Philippo, not far from Calfeld with his son, Carolo Victore, can be read in Sleidano. Duke Mauritius, along with others, asked for the release of this captured prince, but Lutherus revoked this in a special letter to the Elector John Frederick and the Landgrave of Hesse, Philippum. 

3 Because it also happened in Wittenberg that Luther could not like it, he decided to stay with the pious and learned prince of Anhalt, Mr. Georgio, provost of the cathedral in Merseburg, and not to come to Wittenberg again. However, he was requested by the Elector of Saxony's envoy and the University of Wittenberg, turned back there, and concluded his last work in Genesin, on which he had worked for ten years with the utmost diligence, on November 17 of this year with the following words: | can no longer, | am weak, orale vsniri pro ine, pray God for me that he may grant me a good blessed hour. The letters he wrote also in this year to learned people are in Tom. Ill. epistolar. Luth. 





II. D. M. Luther's writing against Jakob Hochstaten, July 13, 1519. 


This writing has its occasion in Luther's thirteenth thesis for the Leipzig disputation (see St. Louis edition, vol. XVIII, 721). The heresiarch Jakob Hoogstraten, prior of the Dominicans, professor in Cologne, had described it in a dedicatory letter to his Destructio Cabalae seu Cabalisticae pertidiae etc. to Pope Leo X, dated April 7, 1519, as pernicious to the church; if it were true, no one could clear the popes of the accusation that they were heretics, and for this reason he called on the pope to execute a bloody judgment against Luther. Luther responds to this in a short, sharp manner with this document, which Luther probably made known (in poster form) before the conclusion of the Leipzig disputation. - Already Walch, both in his introduction to the eighteenth volume, p. 59 a, and in the preface to the twenty-first, § XVII, Il §. E., pointed out that this document belonged to the year 1519, but has nevertheless (as well as all other editions) placed it here in the year 1518. Among the newer ones, first Késtlin, M. Luther, Vol. |, p. 151, has declared with all certainty that the writing, despite the wrong year in all editions up to his time, belongs to the year 1519. The first and only edition of Luther's works with a correct date is the Weimar edition (Vol. II, p. 384). 

A single print of this note is not known. The first impression we have is in the Wittenberg edition (1545), tom. I, fol. CXC Vb, also in the 1550 edition, with the caption: Martinus Lutherus pio lectori; in the Jena (1579), tom, |, koi. 116; in the Erlangen, opp. var. arg., tom. ll, p. 294 sqq; in the Weimarschen, vol. Il, p. 384 and in Léscher, Ref.-Acta, vol. Il, p. 323. Translated into German in the German Wittenberger (1569), vol. IX, p. 25; in the Jenaer (1564), vol. I, p. 61; in the Altenburger, vol. I, p. 70; in the Leipziger, vol. XVII, p. 140 and in Walch, vol. XXI, 118". - The old translation is good. 


God has awakened for me another, and from an old vain new enemy, namely the dear, and with leave to speak, venerable father, M. Jakob Hochstrecken, whom everyone commonly, and rightly, calls heretic. The same, since he punishes my _ thirteenth proposition in the preface of his useless drivel, which he calls a protective speech, he speaks thus: If this proposition is true, then the Roman bishops must be heretics. 

After that he admonishes (as one who thirsts for the destruction and blood of the brethren) with a bloodthirsty tongue the pious, kind Pope Leonem xX, that he should not rise against the heretics with a gentle and Christian, but with a lionish and tenfold mind. Such filth is worthy of all.

that he will denounce the heretics (pious Christians), admonish pope and bishops to shed innocent blood, that he will turn bishops, who are human, into unreasonable, even cruel beasts, and Christians into heretics. This is the way of this new heretic master to plague the Christians.

V.D. M. Luther's writing against the blind and foolish condemnation of the seventeen articles, emanating from the wretched and shameful university at Ingolstadt. Anno 1524, 


M. Arsacius Seehofer had presented the Lutheran doctrine in writings. The professors of Ingolstadt extracted 17 articles from them, condemned them, forced him to recant and imprisoned him in a monastery, from which he escaped to Wittenberg. In this writing, Luther now illuminates and justifies these articles. 

In 1524, several individual editions of this work appeared in Wittenberg under the above title. In the collections: in the Wittenberg (1554), vol. VII, p. 413; in the Jena (1585), vol. Il, p. 421; in the Altenburg, vol. Il, p. 771; in the Leipzig, vol. XVIII, p. 528; in Walch, vol. XXI, 128* and in the Erlangen, vol. 29, p. 75. 


Martin Luther, to all dear Christians grace and peace in Christ. 

1. under the name of the wretched university of Ingolstadt in Bavaria a note with 17 Christian articles has gone out, condemned by them, and by their murderous outrage and coercion revoked by M. Arsacin's Seehofer. Now, their reason and proof is so exceedingly foolish and clumsy that |, along with some other reasonable people, did not think otherwise that such a note would have been invented by their enemy to mock and disgrace them. But since they have been silent about it for so long, and | am also certain from elsewhere that they have condemned such articles and forced them to recant, | must believe and confess that where there is such palpable blindness that they condemn these main articles of the Christian faith, there must certainly also be such art and understanding that cannot show much more lamentable and skillful reason and proof. 

For this reason, | want to let the same notes go out again, and spread such Ingolstadt art and virtue,

in honor of the holy Word of God, so that the weak may be comforted and strengthened, when they see here so apparently God's miraculous work, who, in turn, to exalt and praise His holy Word, punishes and plagues His blasohemers and enemies with such great blindness. And please, let every Christian be commanded to read these Ingolstadt Notes, as one of the best little books, which serves well for the advancement of God's honor, and is worth keeping for our descendants, so that they may know what desperate boys’ schools have been in our times, and how wantonly the wretched devil has ruled in Christendom through such wretched heads in the high schools. 

(3) But with this | will not give cause to the reckless people who boast of being evangelical and yet are not, nor will | strengthen their blasphemous presumption and insolence. For although it is true that God allows such punishment and miserable blindness to pass over His enemies, to comfort the weak and to frighten the enemies of the gospel, yet His marvelous judgment and work is to be feared, lest perhaps it also apply to us, who pride ourselves on the gospel, as if we were it ourselves, without all fear and humility, and in fact remain far behind. He also afflicted the Philistines in time past, that they should bring home his ark with all shame; nevertheless he smote fifty and seventy men at Bethshemesh, that they might see the ark; perhaps that they might think themselves worthy, and be proud of the Philistines' shame [1 Sam. 6:3 ff]. 

4 | am struck by such a work of God, as if he wanted to remind us of our laziness and slothfulness, and admonish us to pray more diligently and to do so more earnestly. For it is certain that the devil, as a highly understanding spirit, could have better prepared such notes and painted them a different color. Therefore, he must either have been specially prevented by God, or, | am afraid, out of superfluous leisure and wanton malice, he mocked our laziness, and thought: What may | use great art and wit against the lazy, indolent Christians? They do not hurt me with prayers; so they attack it even with words. |

5 Therefore let us accept the warning and admonition of God. For we see daily much of the recantation, and few there be that stand. Thus we have ever such a shameful and disgraceful name before the world, as certainly no one has had in a thousand years. Which one can be called Lutheran or evangelical, they think they have called him more than ten times devilish; he must be worth more than one hell. Now it is a great shame and torment, about which all the prophets, and especially David in the Psalter, so often complain and cry out, that we have only great cause enough to pray diligently and to resist the devil with earnestness, whom we see in this, how he drives his monkey game out of men, among whom there are still some who are to come here through our prayers and teachings, and become our brothers; Therefore we owe it to ourselves to take care of them, and to pray and fight for them against the devil, their mocker, with all our strength. May Christ help us, amen.

Ingolstadt. 

This article, as it reads in words, is true, and St. Paul says it Rom. 3, 28. and 5, 1. and is thus proven: The man who is to be justified is now and unjust; for if he were just, he would not need to be. If he is unrighteous and in sins, he lacks the grace of God. If he does not have grace, his works are not pleasing to God or deserving of eternal salvation. For God is not pleased with man's works, but man pleases Him first. As we have Genesis 4:5: that God considered Abel and his gifts; first Abel, then his gifts. Now if the human effect is to please God, man must first please Him; for works do not make a man good, but a good man makes and does good works. Further, if man is to please and be accepted by God, who is righteous, it must be out of God's goodness and mercy. This is called grace, after which come good works. 

Although the reported article is true, it is not only to be held against the simple-minded, but also against the reckless, the indolent and the ungodly (of whom there are many, unfortunately), because he does not think about it in a narrative way, but as soon as he hears it, he says: "Yes, | have a good faith, and | trust God well. If then | would be justified by faith alone, and the just lives by faith, as Paul Rom. 1,17. and Habakuk Cap. 2, 4. say, then | attain eternal life by faith alone; ei, what need do | have to keep God's commandments? For what shall | fast, pray, do alms and other good works; | will keep the faith, and forsake all laborious works, and trust God well; he hath not made heaven for geese 1). And so all the sound doctrine of Christ and the apostles, which teach us to do good, and to flee from evil, are destroyed and mocked. Therefore it is revoked. 

Luther. 

They themselves confess this article to be true, and prove it from St. Paul and Habakkuk, and yet they want it to be kept silent for the sake of annoying the wicked. Is this not a pitiful blindness, to confess that it is true, and yet to condemn it for heresy? and this for no reason, except that the wicked are offended by it. Thou tender, precious truth, must thou now be called a lie for the sake of wicked men.

That means to cut off John's head because of the whore Herodias [Matth. 14, 8]. For so Herod might also say, though John be holy, yet shall he die justly, because the whore Herodias is wroth with him. If, for the sake of the wicked, the truth is called heresy, it must also be said to be heresy that Christ is God and man; for Jews and Gentiles are offended at it. If they had so much brains as to say that the pious were vexed, it would be a better semblance. But they knew well that the pagans did not take offense at it. Therefore, let all the world hear the art of these high schools: divine truth is heresy, if the wicked take offense at it. Fie on the high school! 

Yes, they say, it should not be said in such a bare way. Dear, is it true, why did Christ and Paul say it so plainly? Or do you poor people think that it is possible that faith alone makes right, and faith does good works? One must be said before, the other after. Shall the former be called heresy, merely because it is spoken at another time than the latter? Well then, in this article Paul and Christ and Moses are confessed and denied at the same time by the Ingolstadters, at the same time truthfully and heretically scolded, at the same time condemned and praised. Thus the enemies of God and blasphemers shall fall. Nor do they keep their own speech. They say in the preface: these articles are all heretical; and yet they prove no more than that this is annoying to the wicked.

Arsacius. 2. the righteousness of God is that which God respects, esteems, or takes in us, without any consideration of our works. 


Ingolstadt. 

We understand this article to mean that God's justice is such that it remains undiminished, whether he does to man what he thinks he deserves. And that God also acts badly according to his will and pleasure (that is what he calls his justice) with man, so that man does whatever he wants, good or bad, wrong or right. The first mind would be good; but the other is against the gospel, because the Lord will put the unmerciful on the left hand, among the goats, and say, "Go, you cursed, into the eternal fire" [Matt. 25:41]. 


Gleanings No. V. 





W. XXI, 133'--13k->. 3323 Luther. 

Behold, the scholars should be taken to school cheaply and taught grammatica. Do they not understand the words in the article? For the righteousness of God, as this article speaks of, is that in order that God may endow us and make us righteous, as St. Paul says Rom. 1:17: "The righteousness of God is revealed in the Gospel, that it comes from faith; as it is written, the righteous lives by faith." Thus they interpret it to righteousness, since GOD is called by righteous, and punishes sinners. That should be theologians to me! For this purpose they give him two minds and condemn him, even though one of them pleases them. 

From this one may notice that they never interrogated M. Arsacium, but by force deceitfully and treacherously condemned him. Otherwise he would have told them this opinion without any doubt. But why do they not also accept this article, for the sake of good sense? since in their scholasticism and Aristotelianism no thing is so evil that they do not praise it, where they may only give it good sense, whether they would have to fetch it to Calekut. Jacks are it in the skin inside. 


Arsacius. By no good or meritorious works may man attain leash justification. 


Ingolstadt. 

This article is contrary to the Scriptures, because in the book of the effect of the twelve messengers at the 10th Capit. [Apost. 10, 2. 31.] it says: how the pagan Cornelius, through alms and prayer, which he did in his pagan state, obtained that the true faith was revealed and proclaimed to him by St. Peter. And although it is true that the virtuous works of a mortal sinner are not meritorious in themselves, or that the sinner may attain righteousness, yet the goodness and mercy of God accepts them as better and more worthy than they are themselves, and for their sake does to man what he would not otherwise have done to him if he had not performed them. 


Luther. This is not true that Cornelius did good works in the pagan staude; but he was a proselyte, and had the right Jews faith from future Christ [Apost. 10, 2. 22.], 


Erl. 29, 82-84.

W. XXI, 136*-138*. 


3325 





which faith then did good, and so came to the revelation of the Lord Christ, as now appeared, and to freedom from the law of Moses. "For without faith it is impossible to please God" [Hebr. 11, 6]. Neither is it true that God accepts the good works of a mortal sinner as better, for they are of grace. And here they speak against themselves. For in the first article they confess: The works may not please God, but man pleases Him before. "Whatever happens apart from faith is sin," Rom. 14:23. 


Arsacius. 


God alone makes us righteous by pouring out His 

Holy Spirit on us, without any works on our part. Ingolstadt. 

This article is clear enough from the explanation of the first article, although it also needs a good large interpretation. For St. Augustine says: "He who created you without your doing will not justify you or make you happy without your doing. 


Luther. 


Yes, of course, | must be there if | am to be blessed. God did not let me be born without me. But what did | do for it? And if St. Augustine wanted the Ingolstadt donkey opinion hut, should he therefore be placed above St. Paul? of which this article is, Rom. 3:28. "We hold that a man is justified by faith without works." 


Arsacius. 


5, we should not have any hope or confidence at all. We must set our sights on our good works. 


Ingolstadt. 


This article seems to have a basis in the words of Christ [Luc. 17:10], when he says, "If ye do all things that are commanded you, yet say, We are unprofitable servants." However, he frightens the fainthearted; therefore they should be taught more according to the counsel of the wise man, who says, "All that your hand is able to do that is good, do it without ceasing" [Sir. 35:12]. 1) Item, John in the book of the secret revelation [Cap. 14, 13.]: "Their works will be done to them after 


1) Here the Erlangen edition has reprinted from Walch: "Pred. c. 14", although the preacher Sal. has only 12 chapters. 





follow." Item, the Lord in the Gospel [Matth. 20, 8.]: "Call the workers and give them their daily wages." For even though we should not be discouraged, presumptuous, or exalted in our works, for they are in themselves indifferent and frail, they are nevertheless rewarded out of divine mercy, as stated above. 


Luther. 


Behold, they do not understand the article either; but that you see how they have dealt with poor Arsacio so treacherously and maliciously that they either have not interrogated him or have not let him speak, as they almost confess themselves in the preface. Do you hear it, you coarse asses at Ingolstadt? Put the glasses on your noses, or digest before the good Draminder. 2) Doing works and trusting in works are two different things. The article says "trusting in works"; thus you prove that good works are to be done. When did Mr. Arsacius deny this? Or who does not say that? You are to prove that good works are not to be trusted in; so you speak otherwise, as the drunken answer in their sleep. 


Arsacius. 


It is impossible for faith to be without good fruits or works. 


Ingolstadt. 


This article is against the gospel and St. Paul. For the Lord saith [Luc. 12:47], "The servant that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be smitten sore.” To know the Lord and his will is to believe; but not to do it is to lack works; therefore faith without works is found. Item [Matth. 7, 22.]: "Many shall say at the last day, Lord, Lord, we have done great wondrous works in thy name." They have had faith in Christ, but they lack good works; therefore he will say to them, "Depart from me, ye workers of wickedness; | know not your doings" [Matth. 7, 23.] Paul, in many places of his epistles, separates works and faith from each other. 


Luther. 


Yes, the faith of the servant who does not do the will of the Lord is a faith like the faith of the servant who does not do the will of the Lord. 


2) "Draminder" seems to be one of its wine varieties. 


3326 Erl. 29, 84-86. Ingolstadt Theology 1) Theology is. The article talks about the uncolored right faith, as Paul calls it; knows well that also an invented faith is. And that is a knavery and mischief, that these sophists interpret the article where they want to, and have not let Arsacium hear or speak about it. If this is supposed to be valid, to pervert and interpret the words, then such highly learned people would also like to say that God is called a devil, since it is written: "God created the heavens and the earth" [Gen. 1,1]. 


Arsacius. (7) If the Scripture says that good works are rewarded, or that wages are given for good works, it is to be understood that we are saved by faith. 


Ingolstadt. 


This article is freely and wantonly spoken without any reason of the Scriptures, therefore it is to be rejected, as the master himself renounces 2) in the following 9th article. About this he is also against the Gospel and other Scriptures, as reported in the 5th article, which clearly indicate that God gives reward according to works and not faith; otherwise he would also have to reward the devil, because they also believe, 3) as St. Jacob says in his epistle [Cap. 2, 19]. But because they work no good, they must also receive a good reward. 


Luther. 

But there they interpret the right faith on the wrong faith, the pious Biederleute! But how God rewards the works, is too long to tell here, you may read the sermon of your Mammon. Sophists know a lot about faith, work and reward. And what should be understanding with such blindness? as you have heard above. 

Arsacius. 

(8) Those who refrain from making themselves righteous and good by their good works do not build on the rock but on the sand. 

1) In the Wittenberg: "Theologey Theologey ist". Here Walch has "Theologia" only once, which the Erlangen edition has reprinted, although it asserts that it has taken its text from the Wittenberg. 

2) "vergicht" == confess (cf. begichten == confess). 


3) Marginal gloss: Yes, they also believe, as the donkeys to Ingolstadt are theologians.

This article has sense enough, from what is said at the fifth article. 


Luther. 

This article, like the fifth, also speaks of trusting in works, and not of doing works, since Arsacius confesses in the next 7th article that works are not absent where there is faith. So these blind men interpret it as doing works. To the school and to the vocabulario ex quo 4) with the coarse Bachants. But so it goes with the good Arsacio. If he says that good works are to be done, it is heresy; if he says that they are not to be trusted in, it is heresy. Of course, he would not be able to say any Christian article ever again, because he would not say anything else than, Eximii Magistri nostri, vestrae excellentiae bene dicunt. Vos estis

(9) No one in the church is to be believed except what he presents from the Word of God with certainty and clarity. 

Ingolstadt. 

This is also a sacrilegious, wanton gossip. For it follows that we should not believe that the highly praised Mother of God remained a virgin. Item, that we should not believe the evangelists. For in no place in Scripture is it found that we should believe them. If you say that the Lord said [Luc. 10:16], "He who hears you hears me, and he who despises you despises me," someone might reply that such words were written by the evangelists themselves, therefore they are not binding; for no one can bear witness to them himself. Item, we should not believe the epistles of Paul, Peter, John, Jacob, 2c. For where does the Scripture or God's Word give us this? See what this article can do!

But the fact that they say that it is nowhere written that one should believe St. Peter's, Paul's, and John's epistles, and that Mary remains a virgin, is not worthy to be accounted for; just as if one should lead other witnesses to prove the holy scripture. 

But let it be so, that one should believe the church, which has accepted such a scripture; tell me, where is it written, that one should believe the church therein? If it is written in the same books that she accepts, then the church is testified to, accepted and proven by the books, and not the books by the church. Well now, you theologians of Ingolstadt! See what this article can do!

(10) No man shall do or teach anything in the Christian church without what God the Lord has certainly issued, taught, or commanded. 

Ingolstadt. 


This article is equally evil to the next one. For it follows that no one shall keep virginity, no one shall give temporal goods, no one shall fast. For God has not commanded these things anywhere 2) that no one should engage in marital works with his spouse for any length of time. For although St. Paul has advised the same, he has not commanded it, and (as Luther says) this is a commandment of God, since he says to Adam: "Grow, and be multiplied" [Gen. 1:18.], there would ever be a strange life, and much useless work. 

Luther. 

You, there, so Christo and Paulo are to be taken in the mouth. How often does Paul fast?

(11) It behooves a bishop to teach nothing but the Word of God. 


Ingolstadt. 

This article is too severe and too biting; for we read of St. Paul that he worked; for he could make tents. Apost. 18, 3. Thus, in the beginning, many bishops had wives and children, and no doubt also worked in the flesh. 


Luther. 


Rhyme yourself, Bundschuh. The article says of teaching; so they interpret it of doing. A bishop shall teach nothing but the Word of God. They understand that he should do nothing but teach. And even if he spoke of doing, he is still true. For even Hans Fool knows well that working and keeping house is a farmer's work and office, but teaching God's word is only an episcopal work and office. Fie on you asses! Such pieces all prove that Arsacius was not present, nor was he interrogated, since such a highly praised and well-fouled university condemned him. Oh how right it is for the dukes of Bavaria, who also condemn and persecute God's word unheard, unrecognized, unconquered, that they must have such swine and asses as masters and spiritual leaders; | should not have wished such punishment for them. 


Arsacius.

3) Walch: 2 Cor. 6,6. which the Erlangen edition reprinted.

Erl. 29, 88-90. 


Ingolstadt. 

This article is equally strict to the previous one. For St. Paul and other bishops also punished the wicked and disobedient, condemned them and gave them into the power of the evil enemy until they reformed [1 Cor. 5:4], therefore they not only preached but also had power. 


Luther. 


The fact that the donkeys do not properly translate Latin must be credited to them, for they know neither German nor Latin. The article wants: To be a bishop is as much as profiteri verbum Dei [to publicly proclaim the word of God], whose office is to preach the word of God, as the previous article states; in addition, these well-meaning heads understand the matter in such a way that to banish, punish and chastise the disobedient does not belong to the word of God. Of course, this must be due to the fact that the present bishops only banish and do not preach. Thanks be to the famous university. 


Arsacius. 


If a man leaves his wife or is legally divorced from her, he has the right to take another, and the woman may marry another man, unless it is the fault of the one who has abused her and given rise to the divorce. 


Ingolstadt. 


This article, although some think that it was practiced by many holy bishops in the beginning of the Christian faith, is clearly contrary to Christ and Paul, who says 1 Cor. 7:10, 11: "To those who are united and joined in marriage, | do not command of my own discretion, but the Lord, that the wife should not depart or divorce her husband; but if she departs from him, she should remain without a husband, or be reconciled to her husband. In like manner neither shall the husband forsake his wife"; this is what Paul says. Thus the Lord excludes no other cause than adultery [Matth. 19, 9.], and Christian church determines that in the same matter the words of St. Paul also have force. From this it follows that this article is against Christ and Paul; or else he who wants to keep it despises the order and declaration of the holy Christian church.

GleaningNlo. V 


. W. LXI, 143*-146* 3331 Luther. 

This article, they say first, is against Christ and Paul; then, if that would not hold the sting, they say it is against the order of the church. Yes, it is called church, or the devil's kitchen. Paul 1 Cor. 7,15. says openly: "If an unbelieving husband depart from another believing husband, let him depart; for the brother or sister is not thereby caught." There ever Paul gives liberty to change. What else would it be said that one is not captive? So unbelieving is not only he who is unbelieving, as the devil's kitchen tells, but every false Christian; therefore this article is right and true. 

Arsacius. 


14 It behooves no one to take an oath, for it touches only the honor of God or the need of his neighbor; but for the sake of temporal goods, it behooves no one to swear or take an oath. 

Ingolstadt. 

This article, as it reads, disgraces anyone who swears in matters other than those mentioned. 2) Obliging to sin, it is strict enough. Although it would be good and useful if it were practiced. 

Luther. 

This is a fine little piece, with which one should worship the princes of Bavaria, as with a tender fruit of their well-famed university. They say: it would be good and not to be kept; but because people do not do so, it is heretical. God forbids adultery; it would be good to keep it; but because people do not keep it, God is a heretic. Is true, as true the well-famed University of Ingolstadt is taught! 


Arsacius. 

(15) Because of necessity, then, whoever demands an oath from another is of a suspicious mind, unfaithful, malicious and reckless, and has no respect for divine truth. 

Ingolstadt. 


This article has the same value as the next one above.

Luther. 


They regard him as worthy of the next, if he is a thousand miles away. For the next is of all things a paragon of Christian doctrine; but this one is a little too hui, but not altogether wrong. So well do these people understand what is equal and what is unequal. 


Arsacius. 


The law, given through Moses, requires of men that they may not do. 

Ingolstadt. 

This article, although it is harsh, as if God had commanded something impossible, is clearly written in the Book of the Works of the Twelve Messengers, where St. Peter speaks in the first Apostolic Conciliar [Apost. 15,10.] 1): "Brethren, why do you presume to lay upon the heads of the faithful a heavy yoke, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear?" But even though it was heavy, they were able to bear it with the help of divine grace. But this grace they had not by works of the law; but it was imparted unto us by our Lord Jesus Christ, John the First [v. 17]. 


Luther. 


They themselves prove this article to be true, and again smite themselves in the cheeks, that they condemn what they confess. For the article speaks of God's commandment apart from grace, where it is impossible for us. But that it is possible in grace, Arsacius should have known better than to say, for they do what they would have done honestly and honestly with him, as pious doctors should do. But, as | said, God's wrath punishes his enemies like this. 


Arsacius. 


17. the gospel of Christ is not the spirit but the letter. 


Ingolstadt. 


This article is contrary to the teaching of St. Paul, who speaks in the other epistle to Corinthians 3 Cap. [V. 6.], "The letter," that is, the written and literal sense of the law and commandments, which "killeth" the same. "But the spirit," that is, the inward mind and attitude of the commandments and 


1) Here the Erlanger has again reprinted from Walch: "Apostelg. 15, 9." 





Law in the Spirit of God, that is, in grace and willingness, "the same gives life to men." And St. Paul understands in this saying by the spirit the evangelical law, and by the letter the law of Moses. Item, he is against the words of our Lord, who says John 6 [v. 63], "The words that | speak are the Spirit and the life." Amen. 


Luther. 


| will hold this article up to them. For how should the Sau know what spirit and letter are, if Origen, Jerome and almost all ancient teachers, except Augustine, did not know the same? It is enough, if the famous university only knew from the Vocabulario ex quo, what Litera [letters] and Spiritus [spirit] means in German. 


Ingolstadt. 


For the reasons stated in the Holy Scriptures, each one may consider and recognize for himself that these articles are heretical, repugnant to the Roman Church and sacrilegious; Therefore, the reported Magister Arsacius has been forced by us to recant, and for his committed sacrilege, wanton teaching, after expulsion of the spiritual rights in a hard monastery shall be further decided, so that others also take example and fright, not to give themselves so easily with sacrilege and insanity, but to remain in peace with the Roman Church. 


Luther.

For, these notes deceive me, methinks, all sows in Bavaria have run to the famous high school in Ingolstadt, and have become doctores, magistri, and vain famous university, that henceforth no better mind can be hoped for in Bavaria. God save and protect Bavaria from these miserable, blind sophists, amen.

1. it is not proper in any way to give the cities, which have been assigned to princes 


1) Walch: "accepting poems". - pretended accepting. 


"gedichte Annehmen" == 


to take them in hand and in covenant. For what would that be other than reaching into foreign sovereignty, and by this appearance depriving the other princes of land and people? And if this should be right for our part, the opposite should also practice the same with our cities and nobility, of which there are still many who would well like to attach themselves to other princes. 

(2) But that one unites with imperial cities, though | take little comfort in it, for | know well that the mob does not want to suffer for the sake of the gospel: nevertheless it has a different form with the imperial cities than with others. For the imperial cities are potestates themselves, like princes. As far as princes may make alliances, which | am not disputing here, so far may other states do the same, as they are also Potsstates themselves. But the cities under princes are not potestates for themselves; therefore it does not suffer that they want to hang themselves on their own pleasure to whom they want. 

(3) But when it is said that Christians are obliged to help their neighbors in need and to protect them against injustice, | say this: | know well that many things can be made to appear to be true with words, and that people like to respect such appearances and reason, because they want to be wise themselves and let go of justice. This is divine and human right, that no one should encroach on another's authority, and take what is his own, and deprive him of goods or body. One should leave it at that, and not put one's own conceit for public law and God's order. For even if one authority acts unjustly with a subject, it is not the neighbor's duty, who has no authority over the subject, to deny or take away the other authority's power; for God has so ordered property and divided regiments. 

4 Any good that can come of it is easy to take away. If every subject should have the right to seek protection wherever he wishes, then all principality, empire and regiment are already disrupted and destroyed. And if each sovereignty should not have its own regiment, but should take care of all the others, then all sovereignties will be one sovereignty, and there will be only confusion. Nor can happiness

with such attacks. For this disruption of the regiments is contrary to God's order, who has established in the world distinct authorities, dominion and _ property; therefore God is against it. 

5 St. Peter says [1 Pet. 4,15.]: "You should not suffer as murderers, or thieves, or malefactors, or as those who take hold of other people's regiments. Now | cannot understand this case in any other way than that it is to take hold of foreign regiments, and to hinder others of the same authority, and to deprive them of their land and people. ,

[1559], vol. XII, p. 200d), in 1541 (according to which the date of the letter to the king: "1542. Christmas" is to be understood as: Dec. 25, 1541). A second, enlarged edition came out in 1552; a third in 1557. According to the second edition, printed in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, p. 179; without the later additions, namely "of baptism in the house, that baptism is called a water bath in the holy Scriptures, and of the godparents," in the Altenburg, vol. VIII, p. 48; in the Leipzig, vol. XXII, p. 402 and in Walch, vol. XXI, 198*. Luther's addition for this writing of Bugenhagen: "Trost flr fromme, gottselige Frauen, denen es unrichtig in Kindesnéthen ergangen ist," is already found in the St. Louis edition, vol. X, 730, which, according to what is said above, is not to be placed in the year 1542, but 1541. The bracketed piece there (Col. 733 f.), from a letter of Luther to Lauterbach of 8 Feb. 1536, is a later addition.

3 Thus the Son became obedient to the Father even unto death, even the death of the cross; the Lamb of God, who took upon Himself the sin of the world, gave Himself to our death. 1 Petr. 1, 19-21: "You have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, as an innocent and unblemished lamb, who was provided before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the last times for the sake of you who believe in God through Him" 2c. Revelation 13:8: "The Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world." Rom. 8, 32. ff: "He also did not spare His Son, but gave Him for us all, how shall He not with Him give us all things? Who will accuse the elect of God? God is here, who justifies; who will condemn? Christ is here, who died, but rather who was also raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, representing us" 2c. 

Since God has restored everything to us in His Son, and since all the treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ, and since all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, and since we poor Christians on earth are complete in Him, Col. 2:9.How is it then, my dear Lord Jesus Christ, that in your poor Christianity things are found that affect the salvation of souls and the conscience of men, for whom you died, in which no one knows counsel, especially for the innocent part, which can do nothing about it, and would like to have it better, even before God? Yes, no one wants to know counsel in some burdensome matters, and the scholars, who should give counsel from God's word, have so far had foolish and nonsensical consciences, out of human doctrines and wrong understanding of some words in the holy Scriptures, and have burdened the innocent part, just as with God's right, even more, and, with their 


2 To this end, the Father of all mercies has restored | judgment against God, in harm and 


to us His pure gospel at the end of the world.

Danger to body and soul. This is against all rights. The afflicted shall no longer be afflicted. What one does not want from others, one should not do to others. "Give justice to the poor and the fatherless, and help the wretched and the needy to justice" 2c. Ps. 82, 3. 


(5) How is it so wicked that such blindness and such unrighteousness are among those who want to be Christians, and who are the leaders of the church of Christ today? If they are the church of Christ, where is the word of Christ which he says to his church? John. 15:15: "| do not say henceforth that you are servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but to you | have said that you are friends. For all things whatsoever | have heard of my Father, these have | made known unto you.” This is all that you should know for eternal life 2c. As Paul also clearly tells the Christians in 1 Cor. 1, 4. ff.l thank my God always for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus, that through him you have been enriched in all things, in all doctrine and knowledge, as the preaching of Christ has been strengthened in you, so that you have no lack of any gift, waiting only for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, for God is faithful, through whom you have been called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord." How could the bride of Christ, gifted with the Holy Spirit in the Gospel, full of wisdom, and called to the fellowship of the Son of God, not know counsel on some things, in which people would so gladly have counsel, for the sake of their conscience before God, have had to perish so far, in body and soul? God truly does not want that. Matth. 18,14. Christ says: "It is not your Father's will in heaven that any of these little ones should perish. 


But lest anyone think that | am speaking darkly into the common, | will give two examples of such foolishness and grievousness, which were not in the apostles’ days, nor could they be in the bright light of Christ's gospel, but came on after the apostles’ days, and have lasted until now, almost to the twelve hundred years. The first is adultery, where no reconciliation can take place, and the unchristian running away, when someone leaves his wife, so that there is no hope of coming back. Not only has the innocent part not been helped, but it has also been made more burdensome, against the natural right of God, as the child Donatus says: /n adulterum et in 


desertorem Mider the adulterer and the abandoner. Against these two pieces, and how we do it in our churches, according to God's word and right, | have written a booklet to HM of Denmark, Christianum tertium. The other is about the children whom we cannot baptize, and yet would like to: there has been no counsel or consolation, they must all be damned. Against this | have written in this booklet in these last times certain consolation, from God's word, of which no one has wanted to know until this time. 

7. may God grant that we may not be found ungrateful of the unspeakable grace of God, which has come to us in Christ our Savior, and for such enlightenment, that we may comfort all who are in all kinds of distress with the consolation that we may be comforted by God. To Christ, the Lord of glory, be praise and glory forever, Amen. 

(8) Now there is a complaint against some lords and sovereigns that they do not want to act or let act in adulterum et in desertorem, and they rather let the innocent part, which has suffered the greatest affliction, perish in body and soul, with house and property, with children, with honor and goods, 2c., than that they wanted to provide justice, which they owe according to all rights. Some have conscience of it from some words of Christ. Then one should be careful not to do violence to the Lord Christ and his words, as if he had commanded the shameful wrong, to let the guilty part go free, and to weigh down the innocent part; to let Barrabam go, and to crucify Jesus. No, indeed, you should not look for such things in the words of the Lord. We know very well that even holy people have erred in this out of ignorance; unrighteous rights have been made out of this, just as out of Christ's word, so that the innocent people have also been most highly burdened before God. Christ speaks of the letter of divorce, which Moses allowed the Jews, because of their hardness of heart. Out of ignorance, this was later applied by force to other things, as is clear from the measure of adultery, in the words of Christ: "He who divorces his wife, except for the sake of fornication," 2c. How finely the unrighteous rhyme with the word of Christ! Then you see that your conscience is not based on Christ's word, but on error and unrighteousness. Dear sirs, from another's skin is good to cut. You shall not let the innocent be weighed down with your erroneous conscience, but save them, as you desire in your distresses, that God may provide us all with the

Holy Church of Christ. "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." This is God's natural right, against which no right or law shall be valid, as it is held in our Consistoriis in adulterum et in desertorem, namely with a divine and Christian ProceB Juris, so that no one thinks that we handle these two casibus desolately, and that he wants to be the pious ruler, so that he lets the guilty go free and the innocent perish. O delicious law 2c.; this may be read in the booklet,2) which | have written about it. 

(9) But of the children whom we cannot baptize, | exhort all preachers to bring this doctrine to the preaching stands, and see to it that this booklet is in every home. The students and pious people among us are also guilty before God to send the booklet to other countries. You all know why. 


The 29th Psalm. 


A Psalm of David. 


Summa D. Martini Luthers, 


This psalm is a prophecy of the gospel, how it should resound with power in all the world, and put to shame all kings, princes, rulers, nations, wisdom, holiness and glory, and Christ alone should be the king, whom one should serve and honor with right wisdom and holiness. For this purpose he also causes the flood of sin of baptism, in which the old Adam is drowned and the new man arises. 

(2) He called the deserts, the forests, the hills, the countries of the world, which were among the Jews and the Gentiles, all of which he opened, and converted to the gospel. It belongs in the third commandment and in the other petition. 


V. 1. 2. Bring unto the LORD, ye mighty ones, bring unto the LORD glory and strength. Bring glory to the LORD for his name, worship the LORD in holy adornment.

3 The Holy Spirit cries out here with the gospel of Christ into the whole world, among Jews and Gentiles, that all kingdoms and principalities, that is, the powers that be, without doubt, with their subjects, should honor and praise God for His grace and mercy shown to us in Christ, calling upon Him and praying in the name of Jesus Christ. This is the right worship in spirit and truth, John 4:23. And the right honor of God and His name is when we pray, "Hallowed be Your name," that we believe that God is our Father, who provides for us in body and soul, and that we preach this about Him, and call upon Him with faith and confidence that He will hear us and graciously do all things for us, for Christ's sake. 

(4) So we give him glory and strength when we rely on his grace to do all things, and our works, righteousness, ability, and merit are nothing to save us or to blot out sin, as Mary sings, "He has done great things for me, who is mighty, and whose name is holy." Yes, that we may give him perfect glory and strength, we must heartily confess that we are condemned for sin, that no creature in heaven or on earth can help us, and that our merit belongs to hell. 

5. But no one can come to give glory and strength to God unless he alone receives Christ, the Son of God, who died for us, with faith. If you have the Son, you have the Father also. Otherwise, what is said about God, written and performed in worship over the whole world, is only a dream and blasphemy without Christ and outside of Christ, as we have often written before in other Psalms. For so Christ says John 14:6: "lam the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me." We Christians have also experienced this. For through faith in Christ we receive a good conscience before God and the Holy Spirit, but through our understanding, ability, actions and wills we will never be able to do so for eternity. 

6 Therefore the Holy Spirit here demands of the whole world that they believe the gospel of Christ and accept Christ, with these words: "Give glory and strength to God and his name. For the gospel is nothing else but a preaching of God's glory in Christ, as it is said in Psalm 19:2: "The heavens tell the glory of God." See Rom. 3, 21, how Paul testifies to all this clearly and gloriously: "The righteousness that is valid before God is now open.

without the help of the law, and testified by the law and the prophets, but | say" 2c.; read from now on. You see that here too. For the whole world is called here to praise God, they have law or no law, they are circumcised or uncircumcised, have God's sacrifice or not. Thus the Old Testament is abandoned, and there is no longer a difference of persons, as St. Paul says, Gal. 3, 26: "You are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus" 2c. 

(7) But how the mighty, the wise and the self- sanctified stand by the gospel when it comes to them is stated in the other psalm. That God nevertheless wants to have some of them (though not many, 1 Cor. 1, 26.) is indicated by this Psalm, and also by the other Psalm, item, the 72nd Psalm and many other writings of the prophets, which also say of all kings and peoples, not that all people should come, but that no people should be excluded, whether they are Jews or Gentiles, Whales, Indians, Poles, Germans 2c. 

But that the Holy Spirit says here to the mighty, and to the whole world, who give God glory and strength through faith in Christ: "Pray to the Lord in holy adornment", is publicly an abrogation of the old priesthood in the Law. For the priests of the law had special clothing when they performed their duties, and it was especially a great pomp when the high priest was to pray and sacrifice publicly before God, as it is written in the 2nd book of Moses, chap. 28, 3. ff., which are called the holy garments or the holy ornaments. 

But here the Holy Spirit calls all the world, without distinction of persons, young, old, woman, man, 2c., and invites them into the temple, that is, into the Christian church, or kingdom of heaven, as Christ calls it, as it says: "And in his temple everyone will give him glory," that is, preach, praise, give thanks, pray, as it is said in Ps. 23, that we are in Christ, the eternal King and Priest, in God's kingdom. 

But in the kingdom of the world there is now another form with kings and lords, and we must have priests in the spiritual government, who preach the gospel to us, and also interpret the holy scriptures to us. But of spiritual kings and priests, that is all orthodox Christians, Peter says 1 Petr. 2, 9. from 2 Mos. 19, v. 6: "You are the chosen generation, the royal priesthood, the holy nation, the people of ownership, that you should proclaim the virtue of Him who called you from darkness to His marvelous light" 2c. And the faithful say to the Lamb of God, Revelation 5, 


9. f.: "Thou hast slain, and hast bought us with thy blood out of all kindreds and tongues, people and nations, and hast made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall be kings upon the earth." 

(11) The royal and priestly garments, or holy ornaments, are that we be Christians, with the righteousness which we have in Christ Jesus, as it is written in the 132nd Psalm, v. 16: "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints rejoice. And again, "Their priests will | clothe with salvation, and their saints shall rejoice." Paul also says Rom. 13,14: "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ", and Gal. 3, 27: "As many of you as were baptized have put on Christ" 2c. This garment could also be put on by Annas and Caiphas. Caiphas, and other godless priests; but this no one puts on, unless he is pious and righteous before God. Yes, the dressing is the piety before God and before the people, that we believe in Jesus Christ for salvation, and lead thereafter, as the dear children of God, an honest and Christian life, as it is said of the kingdom of Christ, that is, of the Christians Is. 60, 21: "Your people shall be righteous in all things, and shall inherit the earth forever, as the branch of my planting and the work of my hands, to my praise." 

(12) When we are thus clothed with the sacred ornament, whether we are men or women, we come forth publicly, and perform the proper priestly office: we confess Christ, and preach and teach our children, servants, and assistants. For St. Augustine says to his citizens: "What we are in the church, you are also in your homes, that is, we are bishops or preachers in the community, and you are required to be bishops or preachers in your homes. Therefore, you must take care of your household by the word of God, as we do for the whole church, as Paul admonishes parents in Eph. 6:4: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in discipline and admonition to the Lord." Item, we come before God, our dear Father, in the name of Christ, and pray with faith, believing that we will be heard, as Christ promised us John 14 and 16. 

(13) Dearly beloved, let me be lord and priest, which are the children and heirs of God; not of Aaron, but of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of God, the everlasting King and everlasting Priest, who filleth all things in all, Eph. 1. To such graces and divine honors, as | have said, the whole world is here required.

V. 3-9. The voice of the LORD goes on the waters, the God of honor thunders, the LORD on great waters. The voice of the LORD goes with power. The voice of the Lord goes gloriously. The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars, the LORD breaketh the cedars in Lebanon, and maketh them lick like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. The voice of the LORD heapeth as flames of fire. The voice of the LORD stirs up the deserts. The voice of the LORD thrills the deserts of Kadesh. The voice of the LORD stirs up the winds and strips the forests bare. 


(14) The gospel comes first like a thunder and tempest, which is especially terrible on the sea and the waters, which breaks the trees of the forest, even the tall cedar trees of Mount Lebanon in Syria, and the trees of Mount Hermon, which the Zidonians call Sirion. But the Amorites call it Senir, as it is written in Deut. 3, 9, that the pieces and splinters leap and jump like calves and young unicorns. This is a horrible dancing, since also at times the weather lights a fire and burns and skins wherever it hits. The deserts also tremble from the thunderclap, as the great desert of Kadesh, Genesis 16, where the dogs, as stupid animals, tremble and run, so that they also tend to go unadvised with the fruit of their bodies in such a terrible storm. 

(15) The forests are also stripped bare when thunder and weather strike and make a terrible mess. 

God has also often brought such terrible judgment upon the wicked, the despisers of God, by His voice. For He judges all things by His word alone, Ps. 33, 6. When, in the Red Sea against Pharaoh and his army, the voice of the Lord went strong and glorious over the waters that were divided, letting the children of Israel pass through, and drowning the Egyptians, Ex. 14, 28. How horribly He destroyed the proud trees of Lebanon and Sirion, that is, the kings and mighty men who dwelt there, 5 Més. 3 that the children of Israel might take their land! How he punished the godless apostate Jews in the wilderness, Deut. 21:5 ff, and in the desert of Kadesh, Deut. 15. 

17) All this is nothing else than that the voice of the Lord, that is, the gospel, comes only with the preaching of the law, or with the preaching of repentance, so that people recognize their sin, inability, error and condemnation, by which they are terrified, know no counsel and fall from all presumption before the judgment of God.

These are vain thunderbolts and terrible storms in their consciences, so that they must perish completely, unless a gracious rain and God's grace, or the sermon of grace, that is, the forgiveness of sins through Christ, follows soon after. This is what Christ thus says John 16:9: "When the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, shall come, he will punish the world for the sin of unbelief, and for righteousness, and for judgment." And St. Paul Rom. 1, 18: "God's wrath from heaven will be revealed against all ungodly conduct and unrighteousness of men who hold up the truth in unrighteousness. "2c. Thus, God's judgment must first come upon us with the preaching of the Holy Spirit, as you see in Acts 2. 2. otherwise God's righteousness in Christ cannot be given to us, Rom. 3. 

18. the voice of the Lord is glorious and splendid, God's judgment and punishment pierces through, it wants to be unnoticed, everything must be under the feet of Christ, whether with grace or without grace, Ps. 110. As St. Paul also says Rom. 3,19: "That every mouth may be stopped up and all the world may be guilty of God, so that no flesh may be justified before Him by the work of the law, for through the law only comes knowledge of sin. Item, v. 23: "They are all sinners and lack the glory they should have in God" 2c. The sermon is opposed, but it prevails and triumphs over the great men, priests and bishops. Summa, it causes great noise, as Christ says Matth. 10, 34: "You shall not think that | have come to send peace on earth" 2c. Now follow the sermon of grace with the Gospel. 


And in his temple everyone will say honor to him. 

19 Secondly, the gospel with its proper nature comes to such frightened and afflicted hearts as a rain of grace and sunshine after the thunder and cruel storm. For it preaches Christ and in Christ forgiveness of sins, a gracious God, gives the Holy Spirit and eternal life, as Christ says Matth. 11,5. from Is. 61: "To the miserable or poor the gospel is preached." This is actually the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven, where one has forgiveness of sins and eternal life through Christ, which also the children of Christians have, whom we baptize into Christ, as Christ says: "The kingdom of such children is the kingdom of heaven" 2c. This is where the glory of God first comes to people when they believe in Christ, recognize forgiveness, and are saved. 


3352 


of sins, know that they are blessed and children of God, have the Holy Spirit and a gracious Father; so they confess such grace of God in Christ, give thanks, preach and praise God's name that He does everything, that we may be enlightened from our error, be freed from our sins, be provided for this and that life, and henceforth live well and Christianly 2c., as is said at the end of the 22nd Psalm, praying and calling on God, our dear Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: this is the right worship and honor, which honor is demanded of all in the beginning of this Psalm; but here the Holy Spirit prophesies that it will be rendered by all. 


But mark all the words: 


20) First, he says, "Everyone"; for here there is no distinction of Jews or Greeks, of pious or lost sheep or sinners, of priests or laymen, 2c. as said before. 

21 Secondly, he says: "Everyone will say glory”, confess, praise, preach and call. There he gives everyone the priestly office to come before God; as also said before. 

(22) Thirdly, by the word "him" all our glory is excluded from free will, from the works of our wisdom and righteousness, for the forgiveness of sins and salvation. That we may say, as itis written in the 115th Psalm [v. 1], "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy grace and truth"; as we also desire and ask, "Hallowed be thy name" 2c. 

23) Fourth, he says, "In his temple," so that he may lead everyone into the priesthood in a bad way. For to preach and praise God publicly in the temple is certainly a priestly office. 

24) But the temple of God is no longer the temple at Jerusalem, since one stone did not remain upon another, Matth. 24, 2, much less another temple, but the temple of God is the holy church, that is, Christianity, or the true Christians, who believe forgiveness of sins through Christ alone; which temple is called in the Gospel the kingdom of God, the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of heaven; as St. Paul says 1 Cor. 3: "The temple of God is holy. Paul says in 1 Cor. 3: "The temple of God is holy, which is you"; and in 6>, v. 15.19.:"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall | then take the members of Christ and make whores' members of them? Be it far from me. Or do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and are not yourselves, for you were bought with money" 2c.

The Lord sits to cause a flood of sin. 

(25) Here is the way it is to be done in the kingdom of heaven on earth, and how men are to enter (as he says) into the temple of God, that they may come in, praising and glorifying Christ the King who sits and reigns forever; namely, not with circumcision, as before the infants of the Jews, Genesis 17, nor with sacrifices, as before the maidens of the Jews, Genesis 12, but with the blessed flood of sin, that is, with water baptism, sanctified with Christ's word and command. 17, nor with sacrifices, as before of the Jewish maidens, Deut. 12, but with the blessed flood of sin, that is, with water baptism, sanctified with Christ's word and command, Eph. 5, 26, "which is a regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom God has abundantly poured out in us through Christ", Titus 3, 6. 

In this flood of sin, as Peter says 1 Petr. 3, 21. and St. Paul Rom. 6, 4. the old condemned man is drowned with all his sins, and becomes a new man, accepted by Christ, and trusts Christ with a covenant of grace, as a bride trusts a bridegroom, so that there is a good conscience with God through the resurrection 2c. Christ tells Matthew in the last v. 19: "Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." And Marci at the last, v. 16: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved" 2c. and Joh. at the 3rd, v. 3: "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" 2c. This is a better flood of sin over the whole world (as Christ says: "Go into all the world" 2c.) than the one that happened in Noah's time, when the whole world was destroyed and only eight souls were saved, as it is written in Genesis 7. 

With this blessed flood of sin we are taken into the kingdom of Christ, that we may have forgiveness of sins with the Holy Spirit, and be children of God, eternally blessed through Christ alone. Which is entirely the kingdom of heaven on earth. For here the text says: "The Lord", that is, Christ, as Moses, the prophets and psalms say, Luke last of all, "sits", that is, he is King and reigns, as in the 110th Psalm, v. 1: "Sit at my right hand" 2c. Where? "In the temple", as said, that is, in Christianity, where unfortunately the Antichrist has also sat down in these last times, to deceive even the elect, if it is possible, as Christ prophesied Matth. 24, 24. and Paul 2 Thess. 2,4. as if he says that the evil one sits in the temple of God 2c. 

But for what purpose is Christ seated and king in his temple or kingdom of heaven? Answer: "to cause a flood of sin". This must be a flood of grace, so that the Lord will reign as a king. 


3354

a king to help his people and make them blessed, and not as a tyrant or judge to destroy the people. Yes, as it says here, his kingdom will be this flood of sin, so that no one will be taken into the kingdom of heaven or Christ's kingdom who does not enter this flood of sin, as has been said. This is why Christ's baptism is called a door or entrance to the kingdom of heaven, because all who are baptized into Christ have put on Christ, Gal. 3:27. 

(29) Into this holy flood of sin we also lead and bring our children, baptizing them with the baptism of Christ in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; let not the Anabaptists hinder us. We do right, and it would be wrong and sinful if we did not. 

For Christ rebukes those who would not bring the little children to him, saying plainly, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such (that is, the children who are brought to me) is the kingdom of heaven," Ma2c. 10, 14, that is, they have forgiveness of sins, righteousness, the Holy Spirit. Christ is their own, and in Christ they have a gracious Father in heaven, and eternal life. 

(31) To this Christ gives utterance and swears, v. 15: "Verily | say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter therein. Further, Christ is also most kind to children who are brought to Him, as you read Ma2c. 10:16: "He favors them, and lays his hands on them, and blesses them." So that he makes it clear that the promise of God, which God swore to Abraham, Gen. 22:18: "Through your seed (that is, through Christ, Gal. 3) shall be blessed," that is, get forgiveness of sins and blessedness, "all nations on earth.” It also belongs to the children. For the children do belong among the nations; indeed, if we had no children, whence would we get nations? Otherwise he would have to have said: Through Christ all nations on earth shall be blessed, except the little children. No, devil! Christ cherishes and blesses our children, whom we bear and sacrifice to him. 

(32) Then he received the children with such ceremonies, ways, and sacraments as he pleased, and as it pleased him, namely, with hearts, kisses, laying on of hands, and blessing, which is beatification. But now he accepts them with his baptism, and makes a covenant with them, as he did before with the infants in circumcision. He himself commanded us such a sacrament, that by it men should be received into the kingdom of heaven. 


For here it is written: The Lord Christ "sitteth to make a flood of sin". If a flood of sin drowns the great, then the children are truly drowned with it, yes, first of all. Now the flood of sin goes over the whole kingdom of Christ, into the whole world. For unless someone is born again through water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. The Anabaptists say: Where is it written that one should baptize children? Yes, dear, where is it written that one should not baptize them? Christ says in the last verse of Matthew 19: "Go ye into all the world, and teach all nations, and baptize them. Should there not be children among all nations? 

(34) Yes, they say, little children cannot yet be taught as Christ says, therefore they should not be baptized. Answer: Since Christ is not preached, and since Christ's name is unknown, neither the great nor the small should be baptized; they should first be taught, and then baptized, as it was in the world, to which Christ sent his gospel, saying, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel" 2c. But where Christ's name is preached and known, and people are baptized with the baptism of Christ, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Christians should also bring their children to Christ, teaching and baptizing them as Christ commanded, and not neglecting any of them; teaching when we can, and baptizing when we can. We can baptize the little children when they are newly born, but we cannot teach them before they grow up. So Abraham had his children, who could not yet learn, circumcised on the eighth day for an eternal covenant with God, but did not teach them until they were grown, as God says of him, Gen. 18:19: "I know that Abraham will command his children, and his household after him, to keep the ways of the LORD, and to do that which is right and good, that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He promised him." 

35. Christ says that the kingdom of heaven is entirely for the children who are brought to him, and these fools want to shut the door to the kingdom of heaven for them, that is, to forbid the baptism of Christ. Should | not speak here like Peter, Apost. 10:17: "May any man forbid that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost, even as we also?" St. Peter saw the Holy Spirit fall on the Gentiles and heard them speak with tongues; therefore, baptism should not be forbidden to them, but given. Here we hear Christ Himself speaking, who cannot lie that the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of God has come.

He knows very well that they cannot yet hear or learn, as the Anabaptists pretend; therefore, the door of heaven, that is, the baptism of Christ, should not be forbidden to them. 

They are not without God's word, as the Anabaptists proclaim. For this is first their word, the promise of God, so that they may be blessed by Christ: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of God" 2c. For this purpose they also received and accepted God's word and eternal covenant with Christ when they received and accepted baptism. For baptism is not without the Word of God, therefore it is also not without the Holy Spirit and without Christ, as St. Paul says Eph. 5, 26: that "Christ has cleansed His church (where there are also children inside) by the bath of water in the Word" 2c., and Gal. 3, 27, as it is often said: "All of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ", since there is no difference 2c. 

37. They say: The children have no understanding, 

they cannot speak 2c. Yes, dear one, the children of the Jews, who were circumcised, could not do all these things, but were nevertheless taken into the covenant of God. And see thou make not a human merit of thy understanding to hear, to learn, and to speak, or to confess Christ, as though thou wert therefore accepted, and the children were not accepted, because they could not do these things. Christ says, "Truly, unless one accepts the kingdom of God as a little child, he will not enter it." That is, it must be recognized that there is only grace in Christ, that we are accepted by God; so that you should not do or seek any work or merit, not even that you learn the gospel and confess Christ, although you should learn and confess Christ, just as you see an example of grace in the little children accepted by Christ, who do not yet learn or confess with their mouths, and bring nothing to Christ but sin. In addition, you will also hear whether the Anabaptists do not understand that Christ freely and obviously confesses that the little children accept God's kingdom with the word: "Unless someone accepts the kingdom of God as a little child" 2c. (38) The devil would gladly put out of our sight the example of grace in the infants (since no work or merit can be conceived) by the doctrine of the Anabaptists, who say, "The infants must wait until they become like us; they cannot yet hear or speak. But Christ pushes them back, turns them around and says: 


Gleaningsno. XV. 


3357 


No, dear fellows, you must become like the little children, otherwise you will not enter. If the children have no understanding, they cannot speak, but Christ has understanding enough, and speaks for the children with right earnestness: "Let the little children come to me" 2c. Let the man speak, he has a good language, better than all the Anabaptists. 

39. as circumcision was a covenant with God, when God said to the child, You are mine, | am yours, though you cannot speak nor have understanding, so also baptism is a covenant with Christ, when Christ says to the child, You are mine, | am yours 2c. But, as | said, our children are not without God's promise and word, even though they do not yet learn, just as the children in the circumcision were not without God's word. And even though the children cannot confess Christ with their mouths, they still confess Christ with the sign, with the sacrament or baptism, that they will suffer and die in Christ, and in Christ have forgiveness of sins and eternal life; just as the children of old confessed God's covenant with circumcision, and that they were God's people. For thus it is written Gen. 17:14: "My covenant shall be in your flesh, and the soul of the child that is not circumcised shall be cut off from among his people. For he hath made void my covenant." An Anabaptist would say: "Well, the child does not know about it, what can he do about it? How can the child break the covenant of the Lord, who knows nothing about it? This means mastering God's word and grace with our reason. 

(40) | ask the Anabaptists: Shall we not bring our children to Christ in baptism, that they may be born again through water and the Holy Spirit, as said, because Christ commanded us such manner and sacrament, that he might make a covenant with us of eternal life: what then are they in the meantime, or where do they go if they die before they grow up? To this question the Anabaptists do not all say one thing. For some say: the children have no sin, therefore they are not damned. This denies original sin, contrary to Scripture, as it is said in the 51st Psalm, and contrary to our experience. The others, who confess original sin, say: "The judgment of the children must be entrusted to the secret judgment of God. Thus the devil wants us to put God's gracious promise out of our sight, so that we are assured and grope in darkness with God's secret judgments. 

41 But we say that children are conceived and born in sins, and cannot be saved. 


W. XXI, 224*-227*.

We are to become one with Christ, to whom we carry them in baptism. Here we have a salvation of grace, sure and certain: "Let the little children come to me" 2c. We do not want to be deprived of this. This does not mean God's secret judgment and dark delusion, but God's gracious promise that the kingdom of heaven is our children's own if they are brought to Christ. For without Christ there is no salvation. Therefore the Turkish and Jewish children are not blessed, for they are not brought to Christ. 


From the unborn children. 

(42) | say more, upon the same promise of Christ: that the parents, or others who are with them, may and should, while the child is still in the womb, with thanksgiving, commend it to Christ, take it up in prayer, and offer or offer it to him with this or that kind of prayer: We give you thanks, dear heavenly Father, that you have blessed us with fruit of the womb. Dear Lord JEsu Christe, let this child be yours, as you have said: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of God." On this promise of yours we bring this child to you with our prayer, and when it is born and comes into our hands, we will gladly bring it to you and carry it to you in baptism 2c. 

(43) The prayer may be made in other words, but there is nothing to it; if it comes only from Christ's promise of the child, then we should certainly believe that Christ accepts the child, and not leave it to the secret judgment of God. 

44 For we have two strong assurances of Jesus Christ, which he hath not withheld from us, that we may firmly believe these things. One is that he called us to pray in his name and graciously promised an answer, swearing: "Truly, truly, | say to you, whatever, you ask the Father in my name, it will be yes," John 16:23 and many other times. The other is of the little children, "Such is the kingdom of heaven, let them come unto me." Here we Christians should know, when we bring the children to Christ in baptism, or with our prayer, that we bring them to Christ personally, and that he also accepts them personally. For Christ is in his word and promise, in his sacrament, and in our commanded prayer, yes, even in ourselves powerful, present and essential. O an inexpressible grace of God! 

45. Christ swears and tells us to answer our prayer, but we should ask "according to God". 





So the other promise of the infants assures us that we ask according to His will when we ask that He accept our children and let them be His, and gives them the kingdom of heaven, that is, forgiveness of sins, and the Holy Spirit. What is lacking here? Is this not clear enough for true Christians, that we do not need to entrust it to the secret judgment of God? Shall we throw to the wind and despise such a rich promise of the infants? 

46. that Christ also wants to accept the children before they receive the commanded sacrament externally, he proved in John the Baptist, to whom he gave the kingdom of heaven, that is, the Holy Spirit, in the womb before he was born and circumcised, Luc. 1, 44. and Jacob was pleasant before he was born, Rom. 9, 13. 

(47) Yes, you say, Christ nevertheless says, "Unless one is born again of water and the Spirit," 2c., the unborn children do not receive the water of baptism. Answer: Because Christ accepts them, which we bring to him with our prayer, as | said, the Holy Spirit is there with forgiveness of sins, but the water is there in desire; we heartily desire that [it] may come about that we also bring them to Christ in baptism. The desire and good will (because it cannot be otherwise now) Christ accepts for full. For then Christ is given faith and glory in his promise of the infants and his order and command of baptism, that it is true and right for salvation. Therefore he himself baptizes with the Holy Spirit, just as he received the infants through the Holy Spirit with his blessing, without the outward baptism of water, when he said, "Let the infants come to me"; there is certain blessedness and the kingdom of heaven. 

48 Again, he that can have baptism, and thus saith, What shall a handful of water profit? cannot be saved. For he despises the word of God and the ordinance of Christ, and thinks Christ a fool who commanded and ordained useless things. How easily should the fanatic have despised circumcision, and not have accepted God's covenant, because it was very mocking in the sight of reason? We can bring our children to Christ with our prayer alone, because we cannot baptize them, which would not be enough if we could baptize them. For then we must bring them to Christ in baptism, according to his ordinance, that he may make an everlasting covenant with them in baptism, as he made an everlasting covenant with them in circumcision, Genesis 17:11. For this we do not do, 


3360 GleaningsNo, xy. W. XXL, 23V--233-. 3361 
























if we can, would be nothing else but a contempt of divine word and order, and the judgment of God went right, as said of circumcision, v. 14: "The soul of the child that is not circumcised shall be cut off from his people." And of baptism: "Whoever is not born again of water and the Holy Spirit" 2c. Joh. 3, 5. 

49. But if you say here: The Scripture says Eph. 2, 3: "We are all born children of wrath", how then can the unborn children be accepted by Christ in God's grace? Item, Christ says Joh. 3: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, ye must be born elsewhere"; how then can be born elsewhere by the Holy Spirit, who is not yet born of the flesh? so | answer: St. Paul says thus (though it is commonly spoken in other words, there is no great matter): "We were all children of wrath, even as the others." When? Even while we were still in our mother's womb, conceived in sins, Psalm 51. But the word "born" in Scripture does not always mean the outward birth, when the child comes from the womb, but also when it speaks of our incarnation, it is called "born" in Scripture, when the child comes to life in the womb, as it is clearly stated in Matth. 1, 20: "That which is born in her is of the Holy Spirit. This was Christ. But we were not conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, but of Adam out of the flesh in sins and damnation, even when we were not yet born into the world out of our mother's womb and came into the day, but were still in our mother's womb; then we were born, that is, became real natural and living human beings with body and soul, condemned in Adam. Therefore the poor children also in the womb need to be born again with 


hat | also should be baptized with water, | desired with Il my heart that | might be baptized with water aptism according to Christ's command. Should | be ondemned because | cannot have water? Should not hrist, in whom | believe, be forgiveness of sins and ternal life to me, because | do not despise water aptism, but desire it with all my heart? Yes, dear one, n times of need Christ himself baptizes with his Holy pirit, through faith, as Peter says of the Gentiles who eceived the Holy Spirit before they were baptized, in he house of Cornelii, Apost. 15, 9: "God cleansed heir hearts through faith." 


(51) If this is true, why should it not apply to these nborn children whom we cannot baptize, and yet arry them to Christ with our prayer on His promise: "Let the children come to Me" 2c.? Our children are no ore joined to baptism before they are born, than the hildren of the Jews are joined to circumcision before he eighth day, and yet they are not without the aptism of Christ, who baptizes with the Holy Spirit, if e bring them to him, upon his promise, as | said, for ithout Christ there is no kingdom of heaven or alvation. 

The Anabaptists make excuses and say: Christ ays nothing about baptism, since he says about the nfants. But thanks be to Christ in eternity, who has iven us such a promise of the infants, without the nnex of baptism, that we may also accept the romise for our children who are still in their mother's omb. He says badly: "The kingdom of heaven is the hildren that are brought to me. Now we can also carry he children in the womb to Christ with our prayer, as the Holy Spirit through Christ, as we now speak of Said. Therefore the kingdom of heaven is also for them, who were previously born of Adam through the these children, that is, they are accepted by Christ, flesh to condemnation, that is, men with body and [baptized with the Holy Spirit according to His promise, soul in the womb, and cannot be saved without |have forgiveness of sins in Christ, the Holy Spirit, and Christ, to whom we bear the children according to His eternal life. What else could be called "the kingdom of word. heaven"? 

(50) Here | will put a question to thee, answer me God also proved this in St. John the Baptist, whom aright: If | were an undoing Gentile or Jew, and a|He accepted, sanctified and baptized with the Holy prisoner under the Turks, where | could get no water, |Spirit in his mother's womb, Luc. 1, 44, who later, by as some are left to starve and thirst to death. But a|God's command, Luc. 3, began to baptize other Christian would be caught in the same distress, and|people, even Christ Himself wanted to be baptized by he would hear and preach Christ to me; and the Holy him. Who had baptized the Baptist with water before? Spirit would come into my heart, that | might believe] (54) The unholy Anabaptists do not see that the the gospel. But because | also heard, word and promise through the ministry of preaching in 

Christianity, and the prayer of Christians for the promise, is so powerful, and that one can bring an unborn child to Christ as well as a born child. Item, they also do not see how warmly Christ takes care of the children who are brought to him,

and desires and demands of us that the children should be brought to him. Oh how often he looked at the poor children while he was still here on earth, and he lamented about the children and the whole human race's fall and damnation. 

55. But that he was and still is of this mind, he has 

well proved by deed. He became man and redeemed us with his precious blood; he not only became great for the sake of the great, but also a child, so that the children who are brought to him may also be his fellow men. Yes, he was also borne in a virgin's womb, so that the children in the womb who are brought to him should also be his fellow men, as Isa. 9, 6. It is written of Christ: "A child is born to us" 2c. What does "us" mean? | mean yes, it means us humans, as in the symbol Niceno is sung: Qui propter nos homines &c. [which for us men 2c.]. A foolish man may say that our children are not men, but Christ is born, not only when he is placed in the manger in Bethlehem, but also, as | said, in the womb, as the angel says Matth. 1, 20: "That which is born in her is of the Holy Spirit. (56) A corrupt flood of sin drowns not only the great, but also most of the small children, even the children in their mother's womb. So also this blessed flood passes over all, young and old people. Yes, says a scoffer, cows and horses also drown in a destructive flood, should cows and horses also belong to this blessed flood of baptism? Dear, do not scoff, we are well protected and insured with God's word. The Psalm, or the Holy Spirit in the Psalm, does not prophesy that this salvific flood belongs in the cowshed, but will be nowhere but in the temple of God, that is, in the kingdom of Christ, where everyone gives glory to God, where the Lord Christ will sit and remain King forever, as the text clearly says. So that one cannot understand here a corrupt flood of sin, but only a flood of grace in the temple of God, in the Kingdom of Heaven, since the people are not killed with the flood of sin, but they are made alive and saved, since the old Adam with his sins and death is drowned, and the people are born anew, without sin in Christ JEsu to eternal life; since people (who were previously godless and damned, and knew nothing of God's grace and mercy) praise and glorify God, and always give Him glory, as St. Paul says Rom. Paul says Rom. 3, 23: "Here there is no difference, they 





are all sinners, and lack the glory they should have in God" 2c. 

In the temple or kingdom of Christ are all the people who come to Christ. But also the little children come to him, who are brought to him, as he himself says: "Let the little children come to me" 2c., and says Joh. 6,37: "All that my Father gives me comes to me, and whoever comes to me, | will not cast out" 2c. These all belong to this wholesome flood of sin in the temple of God, accepted by Christ, as he also says of the little children, "Such is the kingdom of heaven." Those who are outside and do not come to Christ are not concerned with this blessed flood of sin. 

58 Item, St. Paul 1 Cor. on the 10th Cap., v. 1.2, says: "Our fathers all passed through the Red Sea, and were all baptized under Moses, with the cloud and with the sea" 2c. Dearly beloved, see well what Paul saith, whether he also exclude the children, when he saith, "All our fathers were all baptized under Moses." When they went through the Red Sea, many of the fathers (since Paul says, "All our fathers" 2c.) were still children, even many of them, as little children, were carried through on their arms; in addition, many of the fathers were still in their mother's womb, and were thus carried through still unborn. Yes, the children, born and unborn, who were carried and led through the Red Sea, are the very fathers who came into the Promised Land after forty years; the men who were redeemed from Egypt all perished in the wilderness, without Joshua and Caleb; they saw the water and death (because Pharaoh followed them) behind and in front, and on all sides: Nor did small and great, born and unborn, have to pass through such death and terror, and God delivered them thus. This was God's sacrament and miraculous deed, against all reason and human hope; this is what Paul means, that they were all baptized in Moses (that is, on Moses' teaching, which was God's word) with the cloud and with the sea, as Christ says: with the water and the Holy Spirit. 

59 Here a scoffer says: They also drove cattle through the sea, and cows, were they also baptized? Dear, the cows are not our fathers, Paul says of our fathers. Yes, say the Anabaptists, the little children did not understand the passage and baptism, much less the children in the womb, therefore such baptism, as Paul says, was of no use. Oh, you swarmer! It is God's command, it is God's work and salvation, nor do you say that it was of no use to them. Is it not useful, as the whole

How can the world see that God has redeemed them If you pray in the name of Jesus Christ for the with His word and miraculous work and brought them forgiveness of sins, you will receive the gift of the Holy to life, who otherwise, young and old, born and Spirit. For the promise is to you and your children, and unborn, would have been miserably killed by to all who are feme, whom God our Lord will call” 2c. Pharaoh? Do not swarm to death. So also Joel said, "It shall come to pass that 60. see what happened before in Egypt, Exodus whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall 1:22. the infants that Pharaoh drowned before the be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there eighth day, uncircumcised, are both holy martyrs and shall be salvation, as the LORD hath promised, even the others drowned after circumcision. We must also among the rest whom the LORD shall call." confess the same about the children whom Herod had 64 In the first sermon, when the Gospel was to go killed and put to death for the sake of Christ 2c. Matth. out into the whole world, you hear that the Holy Spirit 2, 16. Himself promises the promised blessedness in Christ 61 Let the enthusiasts go. God is especially fond of in clear, unambiguous words, saying: "For the promise children and has provided for them to be brought to is to you and your children, and to all who are far off" Him, and He accepts them warmly, as He proves by (that is, to the Gentiles, Eph. 2. Isaiah 57), "whom His promises and works. If the Jews had not wanted God", our Lord, "will call with the Gospel. Is it our to lead some of the children into danger, into the sea, children alone who have grown up?

Thus Peter says, as it is written in Acts 2:38 ff. 2:38.ff.: "Repent, and be thawed every man. 










3366 


Our Moses, and all the prophets of the Scriptures and preachers, prophesied and announced to us that all things would be much better for us through the Messiah than before. Until now, whoever of us has not despised God with his word, but has feared God and called upon Him for mercy, has given his children to God according to God's will, in due time with circumcision or sacrifice, and our little children have been God's people as well as the great ones. For God has been their God, according to His promise, sanctifying them with forgiveness of sins, of which it is written in Ps. 51:7: "Behold, | am begotten of sinful seed, and my mother conceived me in sins." Neither did we think that our children, who died before the time of circumcision or sacrifice, should be lost. For they were Abraham's seed, to whom God's promise belonged, and had not neglected God's covenant, Gen. 17. For we waited with the same children for the time of circumcision or sacrifice, and did not want to neglect anything in the dear children that God commanded us. Although the children did not live until that time, we brought them to God with His gracious promise, which He promised to the seed of Abraha, and in God's grace and mercy commanded such children to wait for His promise, and for the future Christ, who was promised to us, of whom we were Messiah's people, and waited for Him to come and make everything better with us, according to God's promise and promise. In this way, the little children were also God's people with us. 

68 What then do they preach unto us? That the great shall be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; but our children shall remain in their sins, and be the devil's people, until they grow up, become great, and understand; but if they die first, they may go to the devil. And according to this preaching it will happen that in our homes, even though father and mother are God's people, five or six of our dearest children will be the devil's people in their sins and damnation. There we will have more devils than holy angels in our homes; there we will toil, drag, cradle, suckle with our children, the devil's limbs. What kind of being does that want to become for us? Yes, we have improved through such a Messiah, as is now preached to us! 

69) Tell me who can, what the pious Jews wanted or could have said differently when Peter or another apostle, as 


Gleanings.No. XV.

| would have said, preaching, "Until now, you have also brought the children to God; this shall no longer be done. Fie on you, you Anabaptist devil. No, no, the Holy Spirit in Petro knows well, and says it better from the prophet Joel [Apost. 2, 39.]: "Yours and your children is the promise." God be praised! 

70 Therefore we Gentiles, who receive Christ by faith, shall also have this grace of Christ with our children, whom we bear unto Christ, nothing less than the Jews. For "in Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female" 2c., Gal. 3,28. If you are Gentiles of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. And Peter also soon speaks of us Gentiles, for he not only says to the Jews, "Your children and yours is the promise," but he also soon adds, "and the promise is also to all who are yet afar off, whom God our Lord will call," no doubt including their children. For the Jews should not and do not have to have it better in Christ than we do. Peter also speaks of this in Joel, who says of Jews and Gentiles: "For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem (Isaiah 2) there will be salvation, as the Lord has promised, even among the other sticky ones whom the Lord will call," that is, the Gentiles whom Isaiah, Peter and Paul say have been far away, far from God, not God's people, like the Jews, Rom 9:4, 2c. With such an opinion of the children, and with the promises of God, promised by Moses and the prophets and preached by the apostles, Christ agrees, and says: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them" 2c. 

(71) | have said all this about this salvific flood of baptism, about all who are in the temple of Christ, that is, in Christendom, the church or kingdom of Christ, in which everyone gives glory to him (as the Psalm clearly prophesies here) with their children, born and unborn, if they bring these children to Christ. For without Christ there is no forgiveness of sins, sanctification or blessedness. No man can be saved, but must remain eternally lost and damned, who does not come to Christ. "But all that comes to Christ," as He Himself says John 6:37, "He does not cast out." Even the little children who are brought to him come to Christ. As he says of the little children brought to him: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such (not the children of the Jews or the Turks, but these children who are brought to me) is the kingdom of heaven.

(72) And they also are brought to Christ, and come to Christ with our prayers, the little children whom we cannot baptize, and yet would gladly baptize them with all our hearts, if it comes about that we can baptize them; and Christ also accepts them, according to his promise: "All that you ask shall be yes. Item: "Let the little children come to me." Item: "Whosoever cometh to me, him will | not cast out." If they accept Christ, whether they cannot come to the water baptism of Christ; for Christ baptized them with his Holy Spirit, as he baptized infants, not with water baptism, which (as it is written in the Gospel) he accepted, embraced, and blessed, saying, "Such is the kingdom of heaven." Dearly beloved, if the kingdom of heaven be theirs, then are they well baptized, free from sins, and eternally blessed in Christ. 

(73) It is not always necessary to carry people to Christ in the arms and on the shoulders, as the infants were carried, of which the evangelists write; as the gout-ridden man was carried to Christ on a bed, as if there were no other way to carry or carry someone to Christ. No, we can also bring or carry people (great or small) to Christ in distress with our prayer, as is seen in the Gospel histories, as Matth. 8, 7. There you read that the centurion (whose faith was highly praised) brings his gout-ridden servant to Christ with prayer, and yet leaves the servant at home in bed, and does not want Christ to come there; and Christ also accepts the servant, even though he does not come to him physically and visibly. This is proven by the deed. For Christ pronounces the servant well at the same hour, just as he pronounces the children blessed who are brought to him, saying: "Such is the kingdom of heaven. 

74 Jn 4:50 You read that Jesus will not go down to 

the king's son, but soon heals him with the word. So that he will make it clear that those who come to him, and are accepted by him, are brought to him by prayer alone. (75) Why should we not offer our unborn children to Christ with our prayers? We want to baptize them gladly and also bring them to Christ with his baptism, if it will be possible for us, and we do not despise baptism at all, which we hold high and valuable. The promises of Christ are strong and certain, that the young children whom we bring to Christ will surely come to Christ, be accepted by Christ, and be blessed. For he says, "Let the little children" 2c. When he accepts them, he will know how to baptize them and wash them from all sins. 





with his Holy Spirit, if it came to the point that we could not baptize them, as he himself baptized his baptizer John in his mother's womb, with his Holy Spirit. 

76. not only was he made great according to his flesh, even as he would have received only the full- grown, but he was also born a little child, even borne in the womb, that such little children also, born and unborn, should be his fellows, if they come to him, that is, if they are brought to him. For he promises them forgiveness of sins and eternal life, saying, "Such is the kingdom of heaven." 

This is all grace with the child, and no work or merit; there can be no dispute about merit and works, as the ungodly reason does, since there is no faith, since God's grace is not recognized in Christ. Whoever does not accept the kingdom of God, like such little children who are brought to Christ, will not enter it, says Christ. 

Item, is this not also a strong and clear promise of Christ, which we cannot miss, John 6:37: "All that my Father gives me comes to me, and whoever comes to me | will not cast out"? Now the children also come to Christ who are brought to him, as he himself says; therefore he does not cast them out, but lets them go into the kingdom of heaven. For he clearly says, "Such is the kingdom of heaven." 

79. but if it comes to the point that we cannot bring them to him in any other way than with our prayers, as we would also like to bring them to Christ in baptism if it were possible, we should know that Christ accepts them (no matter how weak our faith is) for the sake of his promise, since he swears to us, "Truly | tell you, whatever you ask in my name," 2c. But we are to ask according to His will, as John says in the 1st epistle Cap. 5:14. Now it is proven enough that Christ's will is, and that he wants the little children (to whom he has become like) to be brought to him, and says Matth. 18, 14: "It is not your Father's will in heaven that any of these little ones should perish. 

80 And if any man say, Christ speaketh of children born, and of great children, let him know that the unborn children are also lost sheep, that is, conceived in sins and condemned. Therefore we bring them to Christ, their Savior, who died for all people; he wants them, and promises them the kingdom of heaven, that is, forgiveness of sins, the Holy Spirit, and eternal life. There they are 


3370 


GleaningNo. XV 


. W. XXI, 246*-249*, 





baptized by Christ Himself and washed of all sins, taken out of the devil's kingdom and set in the kingdom of heaven. 

(81) This doctrine of children, born and unborn, who are men, that is, having body and soul, who are lost in Adam, Romans 5, | hold to be true. For it is God's word and Christ's gracious promise, and | offer to answer for the doctrine if anyone will challenge and rebuke it. Human doctrine and opinion shall not be valid against such words and promises of Christ, so that salvation is promised to the little children. 

(82) Therefore we Christians should not bury the children whom | would like to baptize, and cannot (as they are not yet born, and yet live in the womb, or otherwise perish in childbirth), in other places, where Christians are not buried, so that we have hitherto meant that such children are lost, as we have been taught. But if we have brought them to Christ, sacrificed and commanded them with our prayers, according to the teaching and clear promises of Christ, as you have heard, it is right that we bury them as Christians, so that we confess that we believe the strong promises of Christ, who also became a child in the womb, and John! Baptistam in his mother's womb, and baptized with his Holy Spirit in such a way that he would not baptize others with water afterward, or baptize them differently, even Christ himself. 

The promises are, as often said: "Let the little children come to me".2c. The unborn children are also little children: "All that you ask, let it be yes" 2c. "What comes to me, | do not push out" 2c. 

In order that we may further understand that the children, sacrificed to Christ and accepted by Christ, also belong with their bodies to the joyful resurrection. For St. Paul Rom. 5:18 says: "As through one man's sin condemnation came upon all men (the children who live in the womb are also men, yes, that is where all men come from), so also through one man's (Christ's) righteousness justification of life came upon all men." The children who live in the womb are also men, no doubt in the number of all men, who also receive justification of life when they are brought to Christ. For he says, "Such is the kingdom of heaven." And without Christ there is no blessedness. 

85 Similarly, St. Paul says in 1 Cor. 15:20: "Christ is risen from the dead and has become the firstfruits of those who have died. 





(who is a man in his mother's womb and became a little child), because through one man (Adam) comes death, and through one man (Christ) comes the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam they all die (even the children who live in their mother's womb), so in Christ they will all be made alive," even the children who are brought to Christ, and so come to him 2c. 

But what ceremonies are to be held over this burial, how much one should sound or sing, that every Christian congregation will know well. For | hear that some pastors and preachers quarrel and argue about this. Which is free, however, to do otherwise or differently, in a Christian way. 

(87) About all this we ask the Anabaptists: from which church or congregation of Christ they come. For they have cut off the church or Christianity of Christ, which has come down to us from the time of the apostles, by rejecting infant baptism, calling us unbelieving Gentiles, and condemning and denying the church or Christianity as not having existed before, and only after a thousand and a half years have they raised up achurch or Christianity which has not existed before. Who has called them that? The wretched devil. There you see what they are looking for. We do not want to allow them to do that. Such gates of hell do not have to overwhelm the church of Christ, Matth. 16, 18. 


And the LORD sits a king forever. The LORD will give strength to his people. 


It is said before that this flood of sin, which Christ as a king causes for his reign, is a flood of grace. For the text and the prophecy say that it will be in the temple of Christ, that is, in the kingdom of heaven here on earth, where everyone will give him glory. The fact that there will be a gracious flood also proves that it says here: "and the Lord sits", that is, he reigns "a king forever". 

89. with this flood of sin he will be king forever, that he may graciously wash away his people in his temple from all their sins, as St. Paul says Eph. 5:27.Christ loved his church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify it, and cleanse it by the washing of water in the word, that he might fashion it unto himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."

90 Thus Christ will reign with this flood in his temple, that is, church or kingdom of heaven, and be king forever. The Jews must not wait for another Messiah. The Antichrist with his priests and monks shall not make us any other righteousness. The Anabaptists shall not change it either. This blessed flood of sin shall pass over great and small who come to Christ in his temple. Yes, God Himself does not want to change or alter such things. This shall be the last supper, where all people are invited, with the preaching of the gospel: "He who believes and is baptized" 2c. This is to remain. The Jews' circumcision and worship has been changed, but this shall never be changed. 

91. "The LORD will give strength to his people." Christ, the King, will not kill his people, that is, those who believe in him, with this flood of sin, but will deliver them from death, as he delivered the children of Israel in the Red Sea, and Noah with his own in the ark. He will give them strength. First, that they may become children of God, John 1:12. He will also make them strong with His Holy Spirit against sin, the devil and the world, so that they will do much good and overcome evil with patience. He will give them grace to do much good in spiritual and _ temporal government, that they may abide in truth and righteousness. As this is often said in other psalms. 

In addition, he says, the Lord Christ will also "bless his people,” that is, provide them with various gifts both physically and spiritually; "with peace,” that is, so that they will prosper, so that even the evil will prosper them for the best, for happiness, salvation and blessedness, Rom. 8:28: "We know that all things are for the best to those who love God, who are called according to the purpose." 2c. 

This is a gracious king and a lovely kingdom, 

where everything is given to the people, and the people are abundantly provided for here and forever, and must not give anything to the king, but only honor and thanks for his unspeakable grace. Praise be to God forever and ever, amen. 94 When | had written this about the infants, our dear father D. Martin Luther read it and was pleased with it, since his reverence had also ordered me to write it. He also wanted me to add a consolation to the women, who have had a bad time with childbirth before this time, and think that they have not prayed in such distresses, and have not commanded God the matter. For it is certain 


True (though they did not know in such fear that they were praying) that they had prayed with unutterable groaning [Rom. 8:26], and would gladly have staked their own lives on it and lost it, that their poor little child might have been baptized; which prayer is enough when there is no other prayer. 

95. But | answered my dear Father and Lord, "I have written in this scripture what God has given me, as | have forewarned, of the children; which some will think is something new. But | have, by God's grace, given this writing the guidance, and have reinforced it with God's Word in such a way that a Christian reader will take pleasure in it and thank God. | will not go further into this matter this time. But if you want to write such consolation on a note yourself, according to the understanding and grace given to you by God, | will add the same consolation with your name to my booklet. This D. Martinus did gladly, and wrote as follows?)

[This is.] Copei of a letter of the most Christian king's envoy, of a frightening miraculous sign, which happened 1) in the shameful death of Martin Luther. 

Terrible and unheard-of miraculous sign, which the God of God has shown in the shameful death of Martin Luther, condemned with sea and body; as one can clearly understand in a chapter of the letter of the most Christian king's envoy, to the honor and praise of Jesus Christ, and to the improvement and comfort of the pious. 


Copei of the chapter. 

1st Martin Luther, when he was ill, desired the holy sacrament of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ; which when he had received, he died immediately. And in his sickness, when he saw that it was very violent and that it was completely inclined to death, he asked that his body be placed on an altar and worshiped as a god. But the divine goodness and prudence, when it wanted to put an end to such a great error and an eternal silence, did not refuse to open such miraculous signs, which were very necessary, so that the people would desist from such great error, destruction and ruin, which the above- mentioned Luther has caused in this world. Therefore, as soon as his body was laid in the grave, a terrifying rumbling and tumult was heard, as the devils and hell were seated in one another, by which all those who were present came into a great fright, horror and fear; and when they lifted their eyes to heaven, they clearly saw the most holy Hostia of our Lord Jesus Christ, which such an unworthy man was so unworthily allowed to receive. | also say that all those who were present seem to have seen the Most Holy Host hanging in the air. Therefore, with great devotion and reverence, they have honestly done the Most Holy Hostia with great honor and devotion to the saints. 

Since this happened, no such commotion and infernal rumbling was heard that day. But the following night, in the same place where Martin Luther's body was buried, everyone heard a greater commotion than the first. Therefore, the people got up and were in great fear and horror. Therefore, when daylight came, they went out.

By this much their lives were improved to the holy Christian faith, to the glory, praise and honor of Jesus Christ, and the fortification and confirmation of his holy Christian church, which is a pillar of the truth. 


And | Martinus Lutherus O. confess and testify with this writing that | received such angry poems from my death on the 21st of March and almost gladly and happily read them, except for the blasphemy, since such lies are attributed to the high divine majesty. Otherwise it hurts me gently on the right kneecap and on the left heel that the devil and his scales, pope and papists, are so cordially hostile to me. God convert them from the devil. 

But if it is decided that my prayer for sin to death is in vain, then God grant that they make their measure full, and nothing else but write such little books for their comfort and joy. Let them always go, they go right, sic voluerunt, meanwhile | will see how they want to be saved, or how they may repent and revoke all their lies and blasphemies, so that they fill the world.

XXID. Justus Jonas letter to the Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony on Luther's death. February 18, 1546. 


From Frick's German Seckendorf, p. 2598, in Walch, Vol. XXI, 274". Most Serene, Highborn Elector, Your Grace are my most submissive, obedient and completely willing services. Most gracious Prince and Lord! To Your Grace | hasten to inform you of my subservience with a very saddened mind: After the venerable D. Martinus Lutherus complained a bit before in Wittenberg, and also on this journey, and also in the wagon, when he drove there, and came hard before Eisleben, also complained of weakness, he nevertheless, as long as we were in Eisleben in these matters of the counts and lords, kept all noon and evening meals, ate and drank quite well over the table, praised food and drink also especially, as it tasted good to him in his fatherland. He also slept and rested quite a bit every night, since his servant Ambrosius, |, D. Jonas, his two little sons Martinus and Paulus, along with another servant or two, lay with him in the chamber, also sent him to bed every night with the warmth of kisses, and brought both of us, M. Michael Célius, the preacher, to bed. Michael Célius, preacher at Mansfeld, and |, Jonas, as he cheerfully gave us good night every evening these three weeks, often with these words: D. Jonas and Mr. Michael, pray for our Lord God that it may go well with his church cause. The Concilium at Trent is very angry. Also, most gracious Prince and Lord, the reported Doctor has sent for his starch cakes, water and aquavit from Wittenberg, the Doctor has also sent some of her own to him; has therefore been with M. G. H., Prince Wélfen von Anhalt, Count Hans Heinrichen von Schwarzburg, for these three weeks, at times for an hour, yes, at times for an hour and a half. But yesterday, Wednesday after Valentine's Day, February 17, he did not go to the meetings due to the concerns of the Princes of Anhalt and Count Albrecht, even at our request and admonition to remain in his room for the morning. 


But in the parlor, stripped of his clothes in the shawl 1) walked around, ever looked out the window at times and prayed, so diligently that we also, who were with him in the room, heard it, but always been cheerful, even let us hear a word at times: D. Jonas and Mr. Michael, | was baptized here in Eisleben, how, if | should stay here? The next Wednesday, however, he did not eat in his room, but outside in the large parlor, talked a lot and of beautiful sayings in the Scriptures over tables, also said in common speeches once or twice: If | trust my dear sovereigns, the counts, and want to tell God about the journey, then | will go home, and lie down in the coffin to sleep, and give the worms the body to consume. On the night of the same Wednesday, before supper, he began to complain that it was pressing him on the chest, but not to the heart, asked to rub it with warm cloths, and then said that the pressure would subside a little; but then he had supper in the large room and said: "Being alone does not bring happiness," and ate quite a bit over supper, and was happy, even with jokes. After the same supper, he complained again that his chest was sore, asked for warm cloths, and we and the gentlemen sent for a doctor, a magister and a doctor; he forbade it and slept for about two or three and a half hours on the quiet bed; Mr. Michael Cdlius, |, Jonas, the landlord, 2) the town clerk at Eisleben, and the landlady, his two small sons, stayed with him until half past ten. Then he requested that the bed in the chamber be warmed for him; this was done with great diligence, and when he was put to bed, Mr. Cdlius lay in the chamber. But his servant Ambrosius, who came with him from Wittenberg, and |, D. Jonas, his two small sons and the servants were lying in the chamber. About eleven he fell asleep, rested with a natural snort. After that, my lord, at one o'clock in the night he called the servant Ambrosius and me, D. Jonas, and first told the servant: make the room warm. But when the servant had hurried, and the room was ready and warm, and he had prepared it all night, he said to me: O Lord God, Jonas, how | feel so sick, how | am pressed so hard against my chest, O | will stay in Eisleben. Ambrosius and all of us ran to him and helped him out of bed.

When he came into the parlor, he went around once more, but then asked for warm cloths; we hurriedly woke up both doctors, doctor and magister, who also came hurriedly, and likewise, my most gracious lord, Count Albrechten, who soon came running with the countess, tried aqua vitae and the doctor's medicine and everything. Then the doctor began to pray: My heavenly Father, eternal, merciful God, you have revealed to me your dear Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom | have taught, whom | have confessed, whom | love, whom | honor for my dear Savior and Redeemer, whom the wicked persecute, disgrace and revile, take my soul to yourself. Then he says three times: /n manus tuas commendado spiritum meum, redemisti me, Deus veritatis [Into your hands | commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, you faithful God (Ps. 31, 6.)], yes, so God loved the world. When, most gracious Lord, the physicians and we needed the best of restorations, he once began to be silent, as if he were sinking, and to answer nothing to our fierce shouting and shaking. But when the countess and the physicians again gave him aque vitae, he began to answer again, but weakly, to Mr. M. Célio and to me, D. Jonas, yes and no. And when we both shouted at him: "Dearest father, you confess Christ the Son of God, our Savior and Redeemer? he spoke once again, so that one could hear it, a strong yes; then his forehead and face were cold. And as hard as one called him, shook him and called him by his baptismal name, D. Martin, he did not answer any more, that he fetched a soft breath and sighed with fallen hands beaten into each other. And, most gracious lord, which we lament with sorrowful heart and many tears, has thus fallen asleep in Christ, safely between two and three in the night towards the morning. Count Albrecht and our gracious wife, the Countess, also my gracious Lord of Schwarzburg, have been there long enough to come to the end. This, most gracious Prince and Lord, | have soon done the following hour according to my subservient duty, although we poor his disciples and disciples from 25 years ago, most grieved by this case, Ew. churflrstl.

use. For this reason, he traveled that day, as mentioned above, from Wittenberg to Eisleben in the name of the Almighty. 

On the 24th day of January he arrived at Hall at eleven o'clock in the morning and lay with D. Jonas at the hostel. 

On the 25th, 26th, 27th of January he stayed in Halle, prevented by water, and on the 27th day, which was the Tuesday after Paul's conversion, he preached there in Our Lady's Church, from the Actis| Apostolorum, about Paul's conversion. 

5 On Thursday, which was the 28th of January, he crossed the water from Hall, together with his three sons and D. Jonas. Jonas, truly with some danger, on the barge across the water, so that he himself also said to Doctor Jonas: "Dear D. Jonas, would this not be a fine favor to the devil if 1, D. Martinus, were to die in the water with three sons and you? and then traveled to Eisleben. 

6. And after he arrived on the border with a hundred 

and thirteen horses before Eisleben, he almost became weak in the wagon, so that his life was also taken; but when he was rubbed with warm cloths in the inn, he ate and drank the evening, and was satisfied, complaining no more; but before on the wagon, as the illness struck him, he said: This is what the devil always does to me, when | am about to do something great, that he tries me beforehand and attacks me with such a torment. 7) From the 29th day of January until the 17th day of February inclusive, he was in Eisleben in the act, and in addition to the act preached four sermons, once publicly received absolution from the priest (who held communion at the altar), and communicated two times. 





God so earnestly and diligently, that we, Doctor Jonas, M. Célius, Ambrosius, his servant, Johannes Aurifaber Vinariensis (after we were quiet), often heard some words, wondered; then he turned out of the window, cheerfully (as if he had laid down a burden) and generally talked with us for half a quarter of an hour, then went to bed. 

On Wednesday, February 17, the lords and earls of H. G. H. himself asked, and we all asked, that he not go to the great rooms in the morning to perform his duties, but to rest; so he lay in his little room on a leather bed, and also went around and prayed in the little room; nevertheless, in the evening and in the morning he sat down at the table in his chair in the great room. And that same supper before (when he passed away blessedly in God shortly before three o'clock in the morning) he spoke many important words and discourses about death and future eternal life, among others saying: 1) Oh dear God, 20 years is a short time, nor does the little time make the world desolate, if man and woman would not come together according to God's creation and order; how much more is it a vain creation: God gathers His Christian church a large part from the little children. For | believe that when a child of one year dies, a thousand or two thousand children die with him. But if |, Martinus, die of three sixties, | do not think that sixty or a hundred of them will die with me through the world; for the world does not grow old now. Well, we old people must therefore live so long that we look the devil in the butt, so much wickedness, infidelity, misery of the

We are witnesses to the fact that the devil has been such an evil spirit. Human race is like a sheepfold of sheep for slaughter. 

11) The Lord Doctor also pondered these questions over the table the same last evening, namely, whether we would also know each other in that blessed, future eternal assembly and church? and when we diligently asked the report, he said, "How did Adam? he never saw Evam his whole life, and lay there and slept; but when he awoke, he did not say, where do you come from? what are you? but: The flesh is taken from my flesh, and the bone from my legs. How did he know that this woman had not sprung from a stone? Therefore it happened that he was full of the Holy Spirit and in the true knowledge of God. To this knowledge and image we shall be renewed again in Christ in that life, that we shall know Father, Mother, and one another face to face, better than Adam and Eve. 

Not long after these words he got up and went into 

his room, and his two little sons, Martinus, Paulus, M. Celius, soon followed him, he lay down in the room in the window to pray according to his habit; M. Celius went down again and Johannes Aurifaber Vinariensis came up. Celius went down again, and Johannes Aurifaber Vinariensis came up, the doctor said: "But | am sore and afraid as before, about my breasts; then Johannes said: "| have seen, when | was the preceptor of the young gentlemen, when they were sick about their breasts or otherwise, that the countess gave them a unicorn; if you want it, | will get it; the doctor said yes. Before going to the Countess, John hurried downstairs and called D. Jonas and M. Celio, who had not been out for over two days, and quickly ran upstairs. When we came up, he complained hard about his chest, because we rubbed him with warm cloths from hour one (according to his usage, as he used to do at home), which he felt and said: it would be better for him; Count Albrecht himself came running with M. Johann, bringing the unicorn, and the Count said: How are things, O dear Doctor? The doctor said, "There is no need, my lord, it is beginning to get better. Then Count Albrecht himself scraped the unicorn for him, and after the doctor felt improvement, he left him again, leaving one of his advisors, Conrad von Wolframsdorf, next to us, D. Jona, M. Celio, Johann, Ambrosio, with him, and at the doctor's request, the scraped unicorn was given to him in a spoon with wine, and Conrad von Wolframsdorf was given the unicorn.

No. XXII. W. XXI, 283*-286*. 3385 Beforehand, the doctor had taken a spoonful himself (so that he would be less shy). 

14 Then he lay down safely at 9 o'clock on the little resting bed, and said: If | could slumber for half an hour, | hoped that everything would be better. He slept gently and naturally for an hour and a half, until 10 o'clock, when we, Doctor Jonas and M. Michael Celius, together with his servant Ambrosio and his two small sons, Martins and Paulo, stayed with him. 

When he woke up at 10 o'clock, he said, "See, you are still sitting; don't you want to go to bed? we answered: No, doctor, now we shall watch and wait for you. With that, he got up from his resting bed and went into the chamber near the living room, which was protected from all air by windows; and although he did not complain there, yet when he crossed the threshold of the chamber, he said, "God, | am going to bed. In manus tuas commendo spiritum menm, redemisti ins, Domine, Deus veritatis. 

16 When he went to bed, which was well prepared with warm beds and kisses, he lay down and shook hands with all of us and said good night. Jonah and M. Celi, and the rest of you, pray for our Lord God and his gospel, that it may be well with him; for the Concilium at Trent and the wicked pope are angry with him. Jonas, his two sons Martinus, Paulus, his servant Ambrosius, and other servants stayed with him in the chamber. 

For these twenty-one days, light was kept in the chamber every night, but the same night the parlor was kept warm; he slept well, snorting naturally, until the seiger struck one, when he awoke and called his servant Ambrosium to heat the parlor for him. When the room had been kept warm all night, and Ambrosius, the servant, came back, Doctor Jonas asked him if he was feeling weak again, and he said: "Oh, God, how | am in such pain. Oh, dear D. Jonas, | think | will stay here in Eisleben (where | was born and baptized). To which D. Jonas and Ambrosius, the servant, answered: "Oh, Reverend Father, God our heavenly Father will help through Christ, whom you have preached. Then, without any help or guidance, he went through the chamber into the parlor, and, crossing the thresholds, he spoke these words as he went to bed: In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum, speak

Erl. 1, 60-62.

misti me, Domine, Deus veritatis. Once or twice he went back and forth in the parlor, then he lay down on the resting bed and lamented that it was pressing him very hard around the chest, but it was still the most beautiful thing in his heart. 

18 Then they rubbed him with warm cloths, as he desired, and as was the custom in Wittenberg, and warmed him with kisses and paws; for he said that it was good for him to be kept warm. 

19 Before all this, and as the doctor was lying down on his bed, M. Celius came running out of his chamber, close to ours, and soon after him Johannes Aurifaber. Then the innkeeper, Johann Albrecht, the town clerk and his wife were awakened in a hurry, as were the two physicians in the town, who all came running in a quarter of an hour (since they lived close by). 20 First the host with his wife, then M. Simon Wild, a physician, and Doct. Ludwig, a physician; soon after, Count Albrecht with his wife, who brought all kinds of spices and refreshments with her, and who did her best to refresh him with all kinds of strength; but in all of this, the doctor said: Dear God, | am very sore and afraid, | am going there, | will probably stay in Eisleben. Then D. Jonas and M. Celius comforted him and said: Reverend Father, call upon your dear Lord Jesus Christ, our High Priest, the one mediator, you have left a great good sweat, God will grant grace that it will be better. Then he answered, and said, Yea, itis a cold dead sweat, | will give up my spirit, for the sickness multiplies. Then he began, and said: 

O my heavenly Father, a God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, God of all comfort, | thank thee that thou hast revealed to me thy dear Son Jesus Christ, in whom | believe, whom | have preached and confessed, whom | have loved and vowed, whom the wicked pope and all the wicked revile, persecute and blaspheme. | beseech thee, my Lord JESUS CHRIST, that my soul may be 1) commanded unto thee. O heavenly Father, even though | must leave this body and be torn from this life, | know with certainty that | will remain with you forever, and no one can tear me out of your hands.

22. further he also said: Sic Deus dilexit mundum, ut unigenitum_ filium suum daret, ut omnis, gui credit in eum, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam ["Thus God has loved the world" 2c.], Joh. 3,16. And the words from the 68th Psalm, v. 21.: Deus noster, Deus salvos faciendi, & Dominus est Dominus educendi ex morte. That is German: We have a God of salvation, and a Lord Lord, who leads us out of the midst of death. 

23) In this the magister 2) tried a very delicious medicine, which he always had in his pocket for emergency, of which the doctor took a spoonful; but he said again: | am going, | will give up_my spirit; therefore he said three times in a hurry: Pater, in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum, redemisti me, Deus veritatis. Ps. 31,6. When he had now commanded his spirit into the hands of God the heavenly Father, he began to be quiet; but one shook, rubbed, cooled, and called to him; but he closed his eyes, did not answer. Then Count Albrecht's husband and the physicians stroked his pulse with all kinds of tonics, which the doctor had sent him and which he himself used. 

24 While he was so silent, D. Jonas and M. Celius strongly called out to him: "Reverend Father, do you want to die to Christ and the doctrine as you preach? he said so that it could be heard clearly: Yes. With that he turned to his right side and began to sleep, almost a quarter of an hour, that one also hoped for recovery; but the physicians and we all said that sleep was not to be trusted, shone lights diligently under his face. 

25. In this Count Hans Heinrich of Schwarzenburg, together with his spouse, also came; after which the Doctor soon paled greatly under the face, his feet and nose became cold, he had a deep but gentle recovery of breath, with which he gave up his spirit with silence and great patience, so that he no longer moved a finger or a leg, and no one could notice (we bear witness to this before God on our conscience) any restlessness, torment of the body, or pain of death, but passed away peacefully and gently in the Lord, as Simeon sings.

master, in front in a house postill, which saying the dearest hearty father thus laid out: 1) 


Never see death again. 


"How unbelievable this is spoken, and contrary to public and daily experience; nevertheless it is the truth. If a man earnestly contemplates the word of God in his heart, believes it, and falls asleep or dies over it, he sinks and passes away before he understands or becomes aware of death; and he has certainly passed away blessed in the word which he thus believed and contemplated." Under this was written: Martinus Luther Doctor. 1546, happened on the 7th 2) day of Februarii. 

27 When he had passed away in the Lord, and Count Albrecht, his husband, and Schwarzenburg 2c. were terrified together with us, still crying out that one should not desist from rubbing and _lavishing, everything that was humanly possible was done, but the body became colder and colder and more deadly. And after the dead body had lain on the resting bed for three quarters of an hour, they made three underbeds of many feather beds next to it, and cloths on top, hard by the resting bed, into which they lifted it, hoping (as we all wished and prayed) whether God would still give mercy. 

Before daybreak, at four o'clock, the noble and highborn prince and lord, Lord Wolf, prince of Anhalt, the noble, well-born counts and lords, Philippus, Johanns Gérg, brothers, Count Volradt, Count Hans, Count Wolf, also brothers, counts and lords of Mansfeld, and other lords, and of the nobility, came. 

The body was left lying on the bed from four to nine, that is five whole hours, when many honest citizens came and looked at the dead body with hot tears and weeping. After that, he was dressed in a white Swabian gown and laid in the chamber on a bed and straw until a pewter coffin was cast and placed in it. Many of the nobility who knew him, husband and wife, several hundred, and a very large number of people, saw him lying in the coffin. 

On February 18, the body was left in the inn, Doctor Trachstet's house. 

On February 19, at two o'clock after noon, he was carried into the main parish church of St. Andres according to Christian custom, with great honor and spiritual chants, where he was buried. 


1) This is in the "Interpretation of Many Beautiful Sayings," St. Louis edition, vol. IX, 1828. See the note there. 2) The Wittenberg edition offers: "on the 17th day". 





Princes, counts and lords, among them also Count Gebhart with his two sons, Count Gérgen and Christoffel, together with their wives, and a very large number of excellent people, accompanied and followed. 

As soon as the body was placed in the choir, Doctor Jonas preached a _ sermon, which _ is excipitated; first, about the person and gifts of D. Martini. 2. of the resurrection and eternal life. 3. warning the adversaries that death would have power behind it, against Satan's kingdom, about the jocum 1 Thessal. 4, 13. f. The body was left in the church during the night, guarded by ten citizens. 

When, however, at the request of our Lord, the Elector of Saxony, the body was to be brought to Wittenberg (which the Counts and Lords of Mansfeld also liked to keep in their dominion, but nevertheless let follow the Elector as a favor), a sermon was preached early on the 20th day of Februarii, which was the Saturday after Valentine's Day, which was preached by Es. Michaelem Célium, on the saying Es. 56, 13.: Justus perit & nemo considerat ["The righteous perishes, and there is no one who takes it to heart"). 

34. And after that, between twelve and one beat, he was again led out of the city of Eisleben with all honor and Christian customs and songs, where again the above-mentioned princes, counts and lords, and besides Count Gebhart with two sons, Count Gérgen and Count Christoffel, also Counts and Lords of Mansfeld, together with Count Gebhart's husband, and their wives (as if they had been at the church before), and a large number of people followed devoutly, and led the body to the outer gate with many tears and weeping; So they came with him this evening as far as the hall. 

35 In Eisleben, before these church ceremonies were all used, two painters thus abconterfeited the dead face, one from Eisleben, while he was still lying in bed in the parlor, the other, Master Lucas Fortennagel of Hall, since he had already lain in the coffin for a night. 

When he was led out of Eisleben, the bells rang in almost all the villages on the way from Eisleben, and the people ran out of the villages, men, women and children, and gave signs of serious compassion. So we arrived outside Halle after five o'clock, and as we approached the city a little, citizens and townspeople came out far along the Steinweg, and as we entered the city gate with the

Leich come, are the two parish priests (after the Superattendent D. Jonas followed the Leich) St.. Ulrich and Mauricji, and all the ministers of the Gospel, also an honorable council of Halle, together with a large number of all council persons, also the whole school, schoolmaster, with all his boys, with usual funeral ceremonies and chants went to meet, also a large powerful people, among them many honest citizens, many matrons, virgins, children, came to meet at the outermost gate, with such loud wailing and weeping that we heard it back there in the last rearmost carriage. And when one went up the streets of St. Moritz, the old market, as well as on the bridge and in the gate, there was such a big crowd around the wagons of the Leich and others that one often had to keep still in the streets and on the market, and one came very late, almost half past six, to the church of Our Lady of Halle. 

The church of Our Lady was very crowded everywhere, since they cried out the psalm "Aus tiefer Noth" 2c. with piteous, broken voices more than they sang, and if it had not been so late, a sermon would have been preached, and so the corpse was hurriedly carried into the sacristy, and guarded through the night with some citizens. 

38 The following morning at six o'clock the corpse was brought out of Halle again with bells ringing, which had been done before in all churches, and honest, Christian accompaniment to the gate, as on the evening before, accompanied by a _ whole honorable council, all preachers and the schools there. 

The lighter departed from Hall on Sunday,

1) This is: Diben. 


Soon the Rector, Magistri, and Doctores and the entire laudable university, together with an honorable council, and the entire community and citizens, were assembled at the gate (as previously ordered by the Elector); the ministers of the Gospel and the school, with the usual Christian chants and ceremonies, proceeded along the entire length of the city from the Elsterthor to the castle church. 

41 Before the. The above-mentioned deputies of U. G. H., the Elector of Saxony, and the above- mentioned two young Counts and Lords of Mansfeld rode in the 65 horses without danger. And next after the carriage, on which the body drove, his wife, the Doctor, Catharina Lutherin, together with some matrons, was led on a little wagon; after that his three sons, Johannes, Martinus, Paulus Lutheri, Jakob Luther, citizen of Mansfeld, his brother, Gérg and Ciliax 2) merchant, his sister's sons, also citizen of Mansfeld, and others followed the friendship. After that Magnificus Doctor, Rector of the laudable University, with several young princes, counts, barons, so in the University of Wittenberg Studii half abstain. After that the body was followed by D. Gregorius Brick, D[ominus] Philippus Melanchthon, D. Justus Jonas, D. Pomeranus, D. Caspar Creuziger, D. Jeronymus 3) and other oldest Doctores of the University of Wittenberg. Then all the doctores, magistrates, and an honorable council, together with the council persons, then the whole great heap and splendid crowd of students, and then the citizens, such as many citizens, matrons, women, virgins, many honest children, young and old, all with loud weeping and wailing in all the alleys, also on the whole market the crowd was so great, and such a quantity of the people, that it was reasonable to wonder in a hurry, and many confessed that they had not seen such a thing in Wittenberg. 

When the corpse was brought into the castle church, it was placed in front of the sermon seat; first Christian funeral hymns were sung, then the venerable Mr. V. Pomeranus appeared and preached a Christian, comforting sermon for several thousand people, which will also be given during the day. 

According to the sermon of D. Pomerani, the Lord Philip Melanchthon, out of special cooperation with

and to comfort the church, a beautiful Funebrem Orationemi, which has already gone out in print, and will subsequently also go out in German. 

After the oratory had ended, the body was carried by some learned magistrates, who let the body into the grave, and thus laid it to rest; and thus the precious organ and instrument of the Holy Spirit, the body of the venerable D. Martini, was laid to rest there in the castle at Wittenberg, not far from the preaching chair (since he had preached many _ powerful Christian sermons before the churals and princes of Saxony and the entire church). Martini, there in the castle of Wittenberg, not far from the preaching chair (where he preached many mighty Christian sermons before the princes and rulers of Saxony and the whole church), was laid in the ground, and as Paul 1 Cor. 15, 43. says: "Sown in weakness, that he may arise in glory on that day." 

(45) May the eternal heavenly Father, who called the aforementioned D. Martinum to the great work, and our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he_ faithfully preached and confessed, and the Holy Spirit, who gave him such special joy, great courage and heart through his divine power in many high battles, help us all to such a Christian departure from this miserable life and to the same eternal blessedness. 

We, D. Justus Jonas, and M. Michael Celius, and Johannes Aurifaber Vinariensis, above-named, as we have been at the blessed father's end, from the beginning to his last breath, testify to this before God, and to our own last journey and conscience, that we have not otherwise heard, seen, together with the princes, counts, lords, and all who come to it, and that we have not otherwise told it, than as it has gone and happened everywhere. God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, grant us all His grace, Amen.

And because this has happened, it is to be ordered to his omnipotence, in whose hands everything stands, although we would have preferred that the said Martinus would have been spared these things, as an old worn-out man, and after we have considered having the body led from Eisleben, brought to Wittenberg and buried there in the earth in our castle church: Our gracious request is that you follow us with the same body and also have it escorted and brought to Bitterfeld. We have made further arrangements, also ordered Doctor Jonassen to travel with the body to Wittenberg, and will thus graciously and completely provide for you.

After you have understood from our captain in Wittenberg where we intend that the venerable and _ highly esteemed Mr. Martin Luther, of blessed memory, shall be laid in our castle church in Wittenberg.

We therefore graciously request that you, along with the other gentlemen, the theologians, discuss what form the epitaph should take for the blessed doctor, and also how the plate with the inscription should be made, and send it to us, and we will decree that it should be cast in brass.

March 15, 1546. 


From the Ella's Frick German Seckendorf, p. 2628, in Walch, Vol. XXI, 300*. 


We have been distressed and upset at most for important reasons that the venerable, our father and preceptor, D. Martinus, has been taken away from this church and school, since the whole of Christendom would still have needed him. We are now orphans, abandoned and lonely. Our sorrow is also increased by the fact that Your Electoral Grace, the world's curiosity, has not yet been satisfied. Grace, imagining the world's curiosity and malice according to their high intellect, will take this case very much to heart. But we must obey the will of God and cling to the consolation given to us by our Savior, the Son of God, when he said: "I will not leave you orphans. Item: "| am with you always, to the end of the age." We rely on this, and want to pray diligently that the Son of God will govern His little ship Himself, and protect it by the grace of Your Lordship, and equip it with divine counsel. We also give thanks for Your Lordship's care for the Christian Church, as witnessed by this congregation and university, and for his command that we do our work diligently. We confess that this is a great burden, greater than we might confess; yet we recognize ourselves bound to it, according to Paul's reminder: "Keep what is entrusted to you," 1 Tim. 6, 20. D. Martinus has ever left us a beautiful supplement and jewel, namely the pure understanding of Christian doctrine. We would like to pass this on to the descendants without darkness, and ask for God's grace and the Holy Spirit for this. We know that unity, humility and patience are necessary for this, and we encourage ourselves and others who live in churches and schools to do so, and with God's

grace to compose our work in such a way that none of us may give cause for unrest. But this is a great matter, which is primarily in the hands of God, whom we therefore implore with fervent supplication to assist and govern us for the sake of Jesus Christ and His glory. 


XXVII_D. Augustin Schiirft program on the corpse of the blessed Luther. 21 Feb. 1546. 


Printed in the scriptis public. Witteberg, tom. I., litter. v. 6; in des Fabricius Centifol. Lutheran. , part. Il, p. 949; in C. G. Hofmann, memor, secular. etc., p. 49 and in Corp. Ref. German in Walch, vol. XXI, 301*. 


Rector of the Academie Augustin Schurs, D. 


There is no doubt that the venerable man, D. Martin Luther, our dear father and teacher, was awakened by God to purify the preaching of the Gospel and to show the Son of God how God sometimes sent faithful teachers out of great mercy and through them again brought forth the light of the Gospel and dispelled the darknesses. Such divine good deeds are to be recognized, to thank God for them, and to love these messengers of God. As the children of Heth say to Abraham: "You are in truth a prince of God among us," so also D. Martin Luther has truly been a prince of God among us. Therefore we should mourn his departure and ask the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, to graciously preserve this church of his. Since his funeral is to be held today and perhaps immediately after noon (for we do not yet know the actual hour, but the signal will be given with the small bell when to gather), we hereby order all students to assemble on the marketplace and there await the venerable D. (Pomeranian), pastor of our church, to follow him immediately and to receive with him the corpse, which has been and will be a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit. 

When they do so, they should remember the benefits that God has bestowed on the church through this teacher and thank him for them. For it is certain that he has explained the doctrine of repentance, truthful invocation of God and right worship in a Christian way, since it had previously been corrupted with nasty, ugly, false and pagan opinions. And although this doctrine is held in low esteem by the greatest multitude, it is nevertheless 


truly that pearl which the Son of God prefers to all treasures. Let us also fervently call upon God not to extinguish the light of His Gospel, and let us earnestly amend our lives, lest the angry God unleash His wrath upon us. 

Duke _ Stillico often said of Ambrosio that if Ambrosius died, Welsh land would perish; and this prophecy came true. For after Ambrosius' death the Goths and Vandals devastated Italy everywhere. So let us remember that the death of this teacher of ours signifies punishments which God wants to mitigate. February 21, Anno 1546. 


XXVIII. Luther's funeral sermon by M. Michael Colius, delivered at Eisleben on February 20, 1546. 


Printed in the Altenburg edition, vol. VIII, p. 853; in the Leipzig edition, vol. XXI, p. 699; in Walch, vol. XXI, 303*; in Cyriacus Spangenberg, Predigten des Célius, 1565, p. 226 and in C. G. Hofmann, I. c. S. 140. 


1. since we have come together today, by God's command and by the well-established ancient custom of the holy Christian Church, at the corpse of the venerable and highly esteemed Mr. Martin Luther, blessedly departed in God: so that we may have the opportunity to lament such a fatal departure from our hearts, and in turn also to console ourselves, let us take before us, at the beginning of this sermon or sermon, the saying of Ezaiah, since the prophet thus says in the 56th chapter: 


The righteous perish, and there is no one to take it to heart; and holy men are taken up, and no one heeds. For the righteous are taken away from calamity, and they that have walked rightly before them come to peace, and rest in their chambers. 


2) These words | have thus taken before me for the entrance of this sermon, as | have heard, not that | want to give the sense or opinion of the prophet, who in these and the next words describes the false and righteous teachers of the church, who they are, what is their quality, action, essence and end, as namely: the false and unrighteous teachers, says the prophet, that they are guardians, that is, they sit in the ordinary office of the church, as also nowadays the pope, his cardinals, bishops, monks, and so on.

They are blind watchmen who know nothing, have no understanding of the Scriptures, nor the mystery of the Holy Gospel, and are dumb dogs who cannot punish, are lazy, like to lie down and sleep, but are nevertheless strong dogs of the flesh who can never be satisfied, stingy and scavenging all the world's goods, from which they live in pleasure and finally have the hellish fire to reward them. 

(3) But the sincere and righteous teachers, one of whom was our dear Lord and Father in Christ, Martin Luther, are true ones, that is, those who have truly known God in His Word and teach and preach the righteousness of faith that is valid before God, along with the good works that He has commanded. And these do not have many good days in the world, which do not rest until they perish and are raised up. But then, the prophet curses, they come to peace, and rest in their chambers. But let us leave this, and this time, as we have heard above, so that we may take care of the departure of this corpse, and, as Paul leaves us to do to the Thessalonians, mourn, but may also again comfort them in a Christian way; so | will only show what kind of man and teacher D. Martinus was, how and why he has now fallen asleep in the Lord at this time, and what his doings and being are now until the day of the Lord. 

(4) When one wants to describe and praise a man in the world, one says what honest race he is, who his ancestors are, what his status, dignity and character are, what good virtue and morals he has had, how he has used them, and how he has resolved his end. And whoever has a good name in this is a great gift from God, especially when it is used properly, and it is right to thank God for it. 

5. And although much could be said about this noble man, that he and his family might have the name and origin of Emperor Luther 1), or else, as it happens with the families in the world, that they rise and fall in reputation; as also David's tribe had fallen in Christ's time, that Esaias compares him to an old dry block (Ploch); and now this lineage of our dear Lord and Father is also no longer in great esteem, but nevertheless this town of Eisleben and the whole Mansfeld country know that he was born in wedlock of honest, pious parents here in Eisleben, and was baptized as a Christian, and after half a year the same parents baptized him.

His parents were brought up in Mansfeld, where they spent the greater part of their lives in honor, who also ended their lives there, and both father and mother, like him, the dear man of God, also in my hands, with blessed confession of their faith and invocation of the divine name, have fallen asleep in the Lord, whom God blesses forever. 

(6) He could also be praised for many of his good virtues. For he loved and kept temperance and discipline, of which no one can truthfully say otherwise; but of these and others | will let others, who are more able to speak and write, say, and for this time alone indicate his office, to which he was called by God, which he led in the church, and what the holy Christian church had in him, to remind you a little of your love. 

Let no one who knows and loves God's word and truth doubt that this man, whose blessed corpse we still see before our eyes, held the office in the church in his time that was once held by Elijah and Jeremiah, John the Baptist, or the apostle. For although these were gifted by God with some special gifts before him, as far as the ministry is concerned, he is truly an Elijah or Jeremiah in our time, and before the great day of the Lord, John the Forerunner, or an apostle. 

(8) For it must ever be said (whoever wants to confess the truth) that it was just in the church that God raised up and called this man to his office, as it was in the days of Elijah, Jeremiah, John, and when the apostles were sent forth by God to preach. The Scripture says in 1 Kings 18 that in the time of the prophet Elijah all Israel had fallen away from God, and one served this God and the other served a different God. The true God had no more than one prophet, Baal had 450 of them. So the prophets of the grove who ate from the table of Jeshabel were also four hundred. 

9 So also in the time of Jeremiah God complains about His people in chapter 2, vv. 7-9, and says: "You have made My inheritance an abomination, the priests do not remember, where is the Lord? And the scholars pay no attention to me, and the shepherds lead the people away from me, and the prophets prophesy of Baal, and hang on to useless idols. | must always reproach myself with you, and with your children's children, saith the Lord. 


2) Thus set by us. Walch offers: "which is [perhaps once] in his time Elijah" 2c.

(10) The state of the church at the time of John the Baptist is clear from the New Testament, that although after the Babylonian prison idolatry was not established as it had been before, the people were divided into sects, and were Essaeans, Pharisees and Sadducees, each wanting to be better than the other, each relying on his own good life, and as the prophet says, worshipping the work of their own hands. The prophet Jeremiah cried out and lamented about this. But Elijah killed all the Baalite priests in one day; John called them serpents and viper-bred, and with a high spirit they reached into all idolatrous beings, overthrew them, and again directed them to the pure doctrine of repentance and forgiveness of sins, and taught them what righteous worship was. 

11. So, my dear friends, as touched above, it has also unfortunately been in the holy Christian church now and in the last days under the papist Antichrist, where all error, heresy, sects and idolatry have flowed together into one basic soup and abomination, there has been no right understanding of the Holy Scriptures, no pure doctrine has been preached for the consolation of consciences, human statutes have been held above God's Word, no one has known how to call upon God, how to turn to Him in need, what to do, or how to serve Him, darkness has covered the whole earth, no light has shone in the Church; in sum, as the prophet Ezekiel says in 34. Cap, V. 5. 6. "The sheep have strayed as in a wilderness on all the mountains, where there is no shepherd." And also as Esaias says in 53: "Each one has gone his own way," but God's way, which the Scriptures teach, and Christ is the Son of God, no one has gone, and the damage is greater than anyone can achieve with words. 

12. For just as in the time of Elijah not God but Baal was invoked, and in the time of John the Baptist everything was full of sects, and one wanted to take precedence over the other, so the deceased saints were invoked, even wood and stones, and as is known in our Mansfeld country, "the willow stick", which they called Gedut, and "the good Lutzen", which is supposed to be a dead dog, and consolation and help were sought from them, as also happened in other countries; and the strong pillars of the antichristian church, the wretched theologians at Louvain, still want to confirm and maintain in their articles. 

(13) Thus it can be seen from the strange and peculiar sects that in John's day there were 


It was child's play compared to the latest abomination of the monks and nuns, cardinals, bishops, and all the spiritual crowd, 1) since no one kept it with the other, each sect raised its own God, its own works, rules, and orders, by which they wanted to be saved, and faith in Jesus Christ was a bad thing with them; one had to have much higher and greater things for salvation than the dear Son of God taught. 

14 Thus, unfortunately, it has been in the church, as it is yet to be proven by the fact that the pope reigns, as long as God has awakened the great man before his great day, who in our time was a true Elijah and John. For as Elias attacked and put down idolatry in his time, so Doctor Martin Luther also attacked and put down the mighty idol of papal indulgences. And as Elijah killed the priests of Baal, so the man of God with the sword of divine word overthrew the missal priests and their idol. 

15. On the other hand, he, like John the Holy Baptist, taught Christian and righteous repentance, and preached how and by what means one comes to a right knowledge of sin, by what means one obtains forgiveness of it, what righteous fruits of repentance are, how one should serve and call upon God, what ranks are ordained by God, what each one should do in his rank, and in sum, the Holy Scriptures, which before were a closed and sealed book, God has opened through him, so that since the time of the apostles they have not been read with such understanding as they are now. 

For now we have a proper distinction between the Law and the Gospel, what each is, what it does, how one should use it for salvation, what good works are, how they please God, why one should practice them, and what follows from them by God's promise. And this understanding was also quite strange and precious to the dear fathers, as Hieronymo, Cypriano, Tertulliano and others, but for several hundred years it completely decayed under the papacy, so that one could not have a constant consolation of consciences in temptation and mortal distress. When the monks were with dying people and were supposed to comfort them, they consecrated them to Mariam. For then they sang to the people and said: Mary, mater gratiae, mater misericordiae, tu nos ab hoste protege, in hora mortis SUSCIPe; that is: Mary, you who are a mother of grace and of all mercy, save us.

from our enemies, and receive us in the hour of death; or have they pointed to other saints, their orders, and good works, which the dear saints never desired, and the consciences having no constant cause to comfort themselves, have at last died in despair of their sins. 

17) But now we have a certain and true reason to live and die on the Son of God, Jesus Christ, our dear Lord and Savior, singing with dear Simeon: Nunc dimittis servum tuum, Domius &c. "With peace and joy | go, in God's will" 2c. Item, we say with dear Stephaneo: "Lord JEsu, receive my spirit to yourself", Apost. 7, 58. and we know with Saint Paul that "whether we live or die, we are the Lord's", Rom. 14, 8. 

18. Yes, but who taught us this blessed art, and showed us the reason why all hellish gates are powerless against it, that out of cross and suffering must come comfort and joy, out of death a fine, gentle and safe sleep, as can be seen in our people under the holy gospel, praise to God, in so many, both young and old, but especially, as we shall hear, in this man of God, that no fear of death is flushed in them 1) and some go to death with heartfelt desire and invocation of God's name, and with joy? 

19 Admittedly, we do not get this art from the pope, who would rather that we die on his letters of indulgence and grace and thus perish eternally, but only that he, together with his own, would lead a gentle epicurean life in dignity and wealth. The bishops do not teach this either. For they neither preach nor visit the sick. Thus the monks would much rather bury us in their monk's caps and in their orders than that we die to Christ; because of them we would not find the right way to eternal life. 

20 Therefore we have to thank God, the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who through His Holy Spirit, out of causeless grace and mercy, has enlightened and awakened this faithful servant of His, who with all diligence and faithfulness preached the Son of God through the Gospel, as the one who crushes the head of the old serpent, that is, saves him from the devil and his power, and says to death: "Death, where is your sting? Hell, where is your victory? But the sting of death is sin, but the strength 


1) "them" put by us instead of: "him". 





of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"; this is what the man taught, and from it believers take courage against sin, death, hell and the devil. 

21 Well, the man who in our times walked in the spirit and power of Elijah, who was also a forerunner before the last day, a true John, is now gone by his last departure, and we shall see him no more before the end of the world. Therefore we also, like Elisha, the prophet, lament: "My father, my father, chariot Israel and his deputies", and with the disciples of John bury him with all honors Christianly to the earth. But we should also not refrain from reaching with Elisha for the mantle of this Elijah, which are his books, which he wrote by inspiration of God's Spirit and left behind him, so that we might also receive his spirit from them. For even though he died in the body, he lives according to his spirit, and in his books, he will also, God willing, be dead with his writings after his death, just as he was his pestilence while alive: and so may we now hold to the same books, hold them dear and valuable, which point us to the holy Scriptures, and thank God for them. And this shall be said as far as the first part is concerned, namely, what Doctor Martin Luther was, and what he is to be regarded and held for, as he was in our time of Elijah and John; not a common preacher, like me and my peers, but a high and excellent man, through whom God has again purified His Church and graced it with pure doctrine and true worship. 

22 Secondly, we also want to say and hear how he died. For he has not yet been buried, nor has he been dead more than one day, and it seems to me that there are already people who, driven by the evil spirit, say that he was found dead in bed. Now | have no doubt that he, who is a liar from the beginning, will devise many more and swifter lies. For he is no longer concerned about Doctor Luther, whom God has torn out of his teeth, he can no longer do anything with him; but he is now concerned about the doctrine, which he would like to harm and destroy. But so that we may meet him and protect the faithful from lies, |, as one who was with him for three weeks, day and night, at his last departure, will report the truth of his departure here in God's stead and before God.

Dear friends, Doctor Martinus did not begin to die only last night, but for longer than a whole year he has always died, that is, with thoughts of death, preached of death, talked of death, written of death; as | wrote the day before, before he decided his end, many comforting sayings from his Psalter, which he recorded there, to comfort himself with it. 1) He often called upon God and asked Him to take him out of this evil world the sooner, because he was tired and weary of this life. He also asked, where it pleased God, that he would not have to agonize long on the deathbed; so he also felt like an old worn-out, weak man; therefore he often said: | will not live much longer. And especially shortly before his end he spoke the words: If the pope or my adversaries got hold of me and wanted to do me much harm, | am too weak, | would soon die in their hands. 

24 Thus, as he was well prepared for death everywhere, God graciously heard his prayers and sighs, and as he was having his supper, and here in Eisleben he went out of the large room into the small room on February 17 at eight o'clock, and according to his habit lay in the window to do his prayer, he did not last long, began to complain how his chest was almost sore; as if he were being rubbed with warm cloths. He was also given a drink of scraped unicorn and wine, so that he would feel better, and when he lay down in his resting bed, he spoke to Doctor Jonas and me, who were waiting for him: Why don't we want to lie down? But we answered that it was proper for us to wait for him now. 

25. Then he got up, lamented nothing in particular, and went into the chamber to his bed, and when he crossed the threshold, he said: In manus tua commendo tibi spiritum meum, redemist me, Domine, Deus veritatis, that is: "Into thy| hands | commend my spirit, thou hast redeemed me, O faithful God"; and so he lay down in bed, bidding us| good night, and said, Doctor Jonah and Mr. Michel, pray for our Lord God, that it may go well with his cause, and with the holy Gospel. For those at Trent in the Concilio do not mean well for him. 

26 So he fell asleep again, and of course, as could not be otherwise noted, rested until the 


1) The meaning is: Célius wrote down sayings from Luther's| Psalter, which Luther had marked to comfort himself with. 








Seiger struck one after midnight. Then he woke up and called to his famulo to warm up the room for him; but when it was already warm, he got up, got out of bed and said: O Doctor Jonah, | am in pain, worry, | will now stay in Eisleben. And with that he went back into the parlor. And when he crossed the threshold, he spoke as before: In munus tuas commedo tibi spiritum meum, redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis. And when he had gone back and forth in the parlor once or twice, he lay down again on the little resting bed, and the sickness became more and more prevalent. Immediately we rubbed him again with warm cloths, and sent as soon as possible for the host in the house, both city physicians, likewise also for the noble and well-born Count and Lord of Mansfeld, and came (since the highly learned Doctor Jonas, | Michael Celius, Johannes Aurifaber and his famulus had been with him from the beginning) as soon as the host with his wife, then one physician, soon the other also, and then Count Albrecht together with his husband. 

27 Since we rubbed with warm cloths, as | said, | asked if he also felt relief, he answered: Yes, the warmth does me good, also kisses warm me, it presses hard, but still spares my heart. And when I, Michael Celius, felt that his shirt was all wet, | said to him: "Reverend Father, you have been sweating, God will give you grace that it will get better. He answered: Yes, it is a cold death sweat, | will die, | will go away. And when they gave him a drink of wine at his request, and one of the physicians gave him some medicine in a spoon, he began: 

| thank thee, O God, a Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that thou hast revealed unto me thy dear Son, whom | have believed, whom | have loved, whom | have preached, confessed, and praised, whom the pope and all the wicked revile and blaspheme. My Lord Jesus Christ, let my soul be in your command. 

O heavenly Father, | know if | am already torn away from this body, that | will live with you forever. Sic Deus dilexit mundum, ut unigenitum filium suum daret, ut omnis, qui. credit in eum, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam. That is: "God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life", Joh. 3, 16. He also said further: Deus noster Deus salvos faciendi, tu es Deus, qui educis

W. XXI, 316*--319*, 


3407 





ex morte; that is, "We have a God who helps, and the Lord God who saves from death," Ps. 68:21. 

28 When he felt that the end was not far away, he said three times: Father, in manus tuas comendo tibi spiritum meum: "Father, into your hands | commit my spirit. Thereupon he was silent. We shook him, and D. Jonas and | cried out: "Reverend Father, do you also want to die to your Lord Jesus Christ and confess the teachings you have done in his name? He answered: "Yes," and turning to his right side, he began to sleep for half an hour and a quarter. And when we did not trust to sleep, but smeared him with agua vitae and rose vinegar and rubbed his wrists, when the seer had a quarter of an hour left until three o'clock in the morning, and we shone a light under his eyes, he took a deep breath, and with that he gently and quietly, with great patience, gave up his spirit. And this God knows, before whom we also take it from our conscience, and want to confess it on the day of the Lord and testify that [it] happened with his departure in such a way and not differently, as one can let it go out more abundantly in print, carried together in a historia. 

29 | have now told this at length, first of all, so that the devil and his followers may be stopped in their lying mouths, and since they will speak otherwise than as they have now heard, they will not be believed. For land others who have been beside it want to be living witnesses of it; whoever wants to give us faith, well and good; whoever does not want to, let him go, lie and deceive on his adventures, he will finally find his judge well, | know, praise God, that | have given testimony to the truth in this. 

(30) Secondly, | have also told this story so that we may learn to prepare ourselves for this last hour and make ourselves ready, just as our faithful shepherd and teacher prepared himself. For although we all know that we must die, there are still very few of us who prepare ourselves for it, so that we can enter into it willingly and with faith. Therefore, as we have heard of this man, who was a great doctor of the Holy Scriptures, and who was gifted with many gifts before others, he went about for a long time with vain thoughts of death, drew together the sayings of the Holy Scriptures, which comfort in the distress of death, and moved them well in his heart, often spoke of them to others, and yet faithfully waited for his office or profession. That is why he also came to the hour when he himself was still 


not knowing how he died, and just as with a sleeping man who does not know how and when he will fall asleep, so he has also come to this blessed rest. And we should learn this art from this story. 

31. And now that we have heard in the shortest and most simple way who Doctor Martin Luther was, how he died, and what we are to learn from it, so that it is useful and fruitful for our salvation and Christian life, let us now hear and move to the third: Why he died just now and in this time, when he would have been very necessary and needed in the Christian Church, against which the Pope with his Tridentine Concilio and all the infernal gates are rebelling, and are trying to dampen and suppress the word of truth that God revealed through this servant and apostle. 

32 Here you will find many different reasons for his departure, and some will say: An old man should not have traveled overland at this time and in such cold; he should have been spared to act in these matters; if he had stayed in Wittenberg, had stayed otherwise or so, he would probably still be alive 2c. It is true that, according to reason, these thoughts and speeches are something that must be left alone; but whoever follows them leads him into the wild sea, and just as the latter, driven up by the winds, can never have peace, so these thoughts in this and other cases do not allow a man to have peace or rest. 

For this reason we must all believe here in our children and say: "| believe in God the Father, the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth. Which is not only to be understood as if God created heaven, earth and all creatures, but also that he governs and sustains them, and that without his will not a hair of our head falls, as Christ says in Luc. 21, v. 18, and David in the 39th Psalm, v. 5: "Lord, teach me that [it] must have an end with me, and my life has a goal, and | must depart from it." So also Job says on the 14th, v. 5. "Man has his appointed time, the number of his moons stand with thee; thou hast set a goal, which he shall not pass over." By these words "the Holy Spirit leads us out of the thoughts of our reason, and helps us out of the wild sea into a safe port, so that we must keep still and say: it is the will of God, God has so sent and willed that he should conclude his end in this city of Eisleben, where he was born and baptized. But for what causes he now and this time demanded from God, that is 


3408 


Nachlese, No. XXVIII. 


W. XXI, 319*-322*. 


3409 





another question. Now one finds in the holy scripture more than one reason why each one dies in his own time. Sometimes God takes away children and other young people as soon as they are baptized, and the Book of Wisdom indicates the cause in Chapter 4, v. 11 ff: God does it "so that wickedness may not corrupt their minds, nor false teaching deceive their souls. For evil examples deceive and corrupt the good, and charming lust corrupts innocent hearts. They please God, therefore He hastened with them out of this evil life". 

This is a great comfort to parents who lose their children in their youth. It hurts reason and nature beyond measure to see children and young people fall away in this way, on whom one has placed comfort and much hope. Some people also think that they want their son to become an honest man, a mother, and their daughter a virtuous virgin. But, dear God, you see, as the world so tempts with evil examples, so Satan does not celebrate to corrupt doctrine and life, and we have a poor frail flesh, so utterly corrupted by original sin, that even though it is covered in baptism, and buried like a fire with ashes, yet sin remains in our nature; and as a maid disturbs the ashes in the morning and lights the fire again, so also when one comes to reason and years, the devil, the world, and our own lust, blow to stir up the hidden fire, the original sin. God must now come first and save the children through death, because they are still innocent. And this, | have said, the parents should let them be their consolation. 

After that, God often takes away the tyrants, as Pharaoh must be drowned with his own in the Red Sea; Sennacherib must be strangled by his own children in his idol's temple; Nero must stab himself, and Julian must be shot in the Persian War, so that God will preserve His Church from them, and they will not even exterminate Him with His word and kingdom, as they have in mind. And these examples are also written for consolation, whether in our time we also persecute great people who follow the Gospel, so that we know that God is still alive and holds over His Church, which overthrew Pharaoh and other tyrants; His hand is not shortened nor has it become too weak, He knows well how to protect His own and to overthrow tyrants. 

(36) But when the prophets die and are demanded away by God, God commonly has in mind that a punishment should follow, such as 


In the Scriptures he often promises holy people that he will pause during their life, but after their departure the punishment will follow. So when Samuel the prophet was dead, the Philistines invaded the land, slew Saul and his three sons and a great number of people, and took many cities where the children of Israel were living. So also after the departure of the other prophet, the Babylonian prison followed, and since God called all the apostles to Himself, except John, who alone was left, the destruction of Jerusalem and all the Jewish land came, which continues to this day, and before the last day the Jews will not come to their land, government and worship. 

(37) And it was the cause of this punishment, that they would not hear the prophets, Christ, and his apostles, but blasohemed them, and persecuted them, when the rod of God was come, and they also received their deserved reward, as it is written in the other book of Chronicles, Cap. 36, v. 15: "The LORD God of their fathers sent unto them by his messengers early, because he spared his people, and his tabernacle. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his word, and mimicked his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD grew upon his people, that there was no more healing." 

(38) There is also great concern that God has taken away this servant of His for our sins. For, as heard above, he preached righteous repentance and forgiveness of sin, according to the command and content of the Holy Scriptures, denounced the abuses in the church, and warned against idolatry, how to call upon God, and what Christian freedom is, for which all the world should have knelt down and thanked God. But the papists, on the other hand, hated and persecuted him to the utmost, scolded his teachings as heresy, and as if the earth did not bear an angry man, this is their gratitude for God's good deed. 

(39) But we, who hold his doctrine, and are reproached for it, think that it is better. We know the way of the Lord, for he has revealed it to us through his word, but we walk according to our own pleasure. In the young there is neither shame nor discipline, they have no regard for obedience; in the old there is avarice, usury and unfaithfulness. No one walks honorably and sincerely anymore; no one is satisfied with his profession. It goes everywhere, as the prophet Hosea laments, that [it] happened in his time before the Babylonian prison, when he says in the 4th chapter, v. 1: "Hear, ye children of Israel, the word of the LORD: for the LORD hath spoken the word of the LORD. 


3410 


Cause to rebuke those who dwell in the land. For there is no faithfulness, no love, no word of God in the land, but blasphemy, lying, murder, stealing and adultery have abounded, and one incest comes after another. Therefore the land will stand miserable, and all the inhabitants will suffer. For the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, shall be taken away." 

(40) And here it is time to repent and weep, not over the same man who has now escaped all evil and rests blessed in God, but that we provoke God with our sins and hasten to punishment more than we do. But | fear that the prophet's prophecy will be true and fulfilled in many who do not care about it, but as he says, "The righteous perish, and there is no one to take it to heart, and holy men are raised up, and no one pays attention. For the righteous are snatched away from calamity." And this is to be feared, that it will fall on many despisers' and impenitents' heads, now that he is gone, and may not see the woe. 

41 Therefore, dear Christians, be admonished, and if anyone has not yet taken it to heart, let him still enter into the matter, listen and pay attention to God's word, repent, and turn every man from his wicked ways. The prophet says that the Lord will also repent and repent of the punishment he has decreed for us; or, if the wicked will have it no other way, the righteous will be saved, if not temporally here, then eternally there; and where the wicked are punished with temporal and eternal punishment, the temporal punishment will be a promotion to eternal life for us who lead a repentant life. The Son of God will also preserve his church in such punishment, and believers will remain and be saved. But the cause of his death is our sinful life, which God intends to punish. 

Now we want to hear for the fourth and last, what this man's doings and being are now, after the body. As we still see him before our eyes on the bier, he sleeps, and certainly a softer sleep than he ever slept during his life, and such sleep will last until the last day, when he is now freed from all care, toil, work and danger, and may fear neither pope nor cardinal, world nor devil. Oh, how the pope, together with his own, has tormented and martyred the pious, faithful and God-fearing heart with his ungodly nature, so that he has seen churches and suppressed all worship.

and filled everything with idolatry and hellish Sodoma, and in addition had to suffer that he was banished and burned in his image in Rome, which they would have much preferred to do in his body. But God graciously snatched him from their bloodthirsty jaws and laid him to blessed rest, and will leave him unbitten. For he is now, as the prophet says, "at peace, and rests in his chamber. 

(43) And it is comforting to all believers that the Holy Spirit calls the death of the righteous, that is, of believers, a peace, and their sleep chamber, as God also says in the prophet in chapter 26, v. 20: "Go, my people, into thy chamber, and shut the door upon thee, and hide thyself a little moment, until the wrath pass away. Human reason is terrified of death because it looks at it as if it were all sorrow and unrest, but Scripture calls it a sleep, and a peaceful sleep of the faithful in their chambers. They also sleep before, that is, God sometimes gives them a comfort that they can despise Satan's and the world's wrathful hatred. But when they are alive, they sleep in a strange chamber, in a strange inn, where they have to wake up and suffer tribulation and persecution again. As we have often seen with the dear man here in Eisleben shortly before his blessed end, that he had joy; but he was still in a strange inn, therefore it did not have to last long, that he once complained with tears one evening: he would have lifted up his heart to God with joy, worshipped him out of the window, but he saw the devil sitting on the pipe box and opening his mouth against him, who hindered him in all his actions. But God would be even stronger than Satan, he would know that for sure. 

44 Then God had given him rest, that is, comfort of heart, but he did not yet rest in his chamber, so he had to be disturbed from his rest by Satan and awakened. But now he has peace and rest in his chamber, he will not be put out of his rest anymore. As all believers, who have fallen asleep in Christ since Adam's time, 





rest gently and quietly, and as the Psalm says: "The sun does not burn on them by day, nor does the cold oppress them by night," Ps. 121:6. And even though he and all of us have already been consumed by worms and, as we were created from the earth, must become earth again, yet it happens without all feeling, without pain and without pain, and is as St. Paul says, 1 Cor. 15, 42. ff: "It is sown corruptible, and becomes

3413 





rise incorruptible; it is sown in dishonor, and shall rise in glory; it is sown in weakness, and shall rise in power; it is sown a natural body, and shall rise a spiritual body." 

45 And now let this be said of the nature of our dear Lord and Father after his blessed departure, as far as the body is concerned, which we, together with ours and all the faithful, will see resurrected on the last day, like the body which Christ brought forth on the holy day of Easter, more beautiful than the sun when it rises in the bright sky, faster and more agile than it runs, and more powerful than all creatures. That then no one will challenge, afflict, or kill the body, but as the Son of God threw all things under his feet, so also death, the devil, and hell, together with all creatures, will be subject to him and to us. And in these words we shall comfort ourselves over this blessed body and against our death. 

46 But as far as the spirit or soul is concerned, it is not the opinion, as some pessimists pretend, that the spirit or soul of man should also sleep until the last day. If the soul did not sleep because it was locked in the body as in a dungeon and, as the Book of Wisdom says, "weighed down," should it now sleep because it is released from the dungeon? The soul's nature was not created by God to sleep, but to live, watch and work at all times. When the body is asleep, the soul is awake, as we have experienced in natural dreams and many other things. Therefore it is a mistake for some to pretend that the soul sleeps until the last day, just like the body; but it is certain that it wakes and lives, just as it lived before it came to the body and first made it alive; thus it lives after separation from the body, and will make it alive by God's mighty hand when it comes to the body again on the great day of the Lord. 


47 And the holy scripture Luc. 16, 22. agrees with this, where Abraham speaks to the rich man who was buried in hell and saw Lazarum sitting in his lap. A sleeping or dead person cannot do this; Revelation 6:10, the souls of those who were slain cry out because of God's word. But they are shown to be awake and alive. Thus Christ says: "Let God be the God of the living, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, therefore they must live," Matth. 22, 32. Now they were alive after the 





For this reason they live according to the soul, and certainly live with God and our Lord Christ. 

48 For thus it is written, Ecclesiastes 12:7: "The dust must return to the earth as it was, and the spirit to God who gave it. Thus Christ says to the thief: "Today you shall be with me in paradise,” Luc. 23, 43. Item: "We live or die, then we are the Lord's," cf. Rom. 14, v. 8, and Revelation 6. John beheld under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, which they had, crying with a loud voice, and saying, "O Lord, thou holy and true, how long wilt thou judge, and not avenge the blood of them that dwell on the earth? And to them was given every man a white robe, and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet a little season, until their fellowservants and brethren should come in full, and be put to death like unto them." 

(49) From this saying (as well as from the others) itis clear that the souls of the deceased are alive and awake; otherwise they would not cry out with a loud voice, and in addition by God and our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the altar. From which it follows that, since this servant of God is different with the invocation and confession of the name of Christ, he must also be with God and His Son according to his spirit, and has his being among the dear angels and chosen ones of God. But how he is held especially by Moses, Esaiah, the prophets and apostles, and especially by St. Paul, who has written books on the subject. Paul, whose books lay darkly in the darkness, until he, through the spirit of Elijah, with preaching and writing, brought them back to the light and the right use of the church, and the Lamb of God in the midst of them, whom they follow where he goes, which they have recognized and made known in life: this we also want to experience and see, when the merciful God, a father of our Lord Jesus Christ, will also promote us blessedly hereafter. 

50. Now that we have heard who Doctor Martin Luther was, namely a true Elijah and John Baptist in our time, how Christian he fell asleep in the Lord, and why he has just now been recalled from this world by God, also what his doings and nature are now, Let us commend him to the Lord, and ask God to send another prophet of His Church in his place, and after this Elijah to give an Elisha, who will have as much of his spirit as he has, and will repay Roman Babylon for what has been done so far. Also 


3414 


that we, enlightened by the Holy Spirit, let ourselves be led by His books into the Holy Scriptures, and in right faith and life also blessedly conclude our last hour, Amen! 


XXIX D. Johann Bugenhagen's Sermon, at Luther's Corpse and Burial on 22 Fe. bruary 1546 in Wittenberg. 


This sermon was printed in a single edition at Wittenberg, Frankfurt and another unnamed place in 1546. 4. In the collections: in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, p. 465; in the Altenburg, vol. VIII, p. 863; in the Leipzig, vol. XXI, p. 715; in Walch, vol. XXI, 329* and in C. G. Hofmann, |. c.

Paul the holy apostle, 1 Thessal. 4,13.14., says: 


But we do not want to keep you, brethren, from those who are asleep, so that you will not be sad like the others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, God will also bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. 


Dear friends! | am now to preach a sermon at the funeral of our beloved father, D. Martini blessed; but what or how am | to speak, if | cannot make a word because of weeping? And who shall comfort you, if |, your pastor and preacher, cannot speak? Where can I turn from you? | will no doubt make more weeping and mourning with my speech. For how should we not all heartily mourn, if God has sent us this affliction, and has taken away from us the high, dear man, the venerable D. Martin Luther, from us, through whom he has shown unspeakable gifts and grace to all of us and to all churches of Christ in German lands, as well as to many in foreign nations, through whom he has also gloriously triumphed against the kingdom of Satan, against all kinds of shameful idolatry and human doctrines, even, as St. Paul calls it, against the doctrines of the devil in all the world, and has revealed to us in the gospel the high, great, heavenly mystery, his dear Son Jesus Christ (as St. Paul calls it to the Ephesians and Colossians). Paul also calls it), through whom our dear Father Christ has given his

3415 


He defended the gospel against the wicked pope and all kinds of mobs and tyrants, even against all the gates of hell, to which great man he gave the spirit of power and strength, so that he spared no one how great and powerful he was, and so joyfully held the gospel and pure doctrine that it was often considered by the world as if he were too harsh with punishments and scoldings, and did too much to him; Just as the Jews and Pharisees, the bitter and poisonous vipers, blamed Christ, because it hurt them and hurt them that they were punished by the truth, but they still did not accept the sound doctrine. 

This high teacher and prophet and reformer of the Church sent by God has been taken away from us by God. Oh, how can we stop mourning and crying? How can we obey the dear Paulo here, when he says: "You should not be sad about those who are sleeping"? But he nevertheless adds, "like the others who have no hope". But we who believe know that those who have fallen asleep in Christ will be awakened again to a better life, when we shall again meet with them and be with one another forever. 

3. but the world has not been worthy to have this great man of God any longer, to continue to blaspheme and persecute him; although the same ungrateful world has also received much good through this great man, especially in that it has been delivered from so many troubles and tyranny of the troublesome papacy, so that many of the adversaries (with whom there is_ still some wisdom or understanding) would rather that the great man had lived a long time. 

(4) This | said at the beginning, that we have great cause to mourn heartily, because we have lost such a high and noble man. And truly (if that may be of any help) Christian kings, princes and cities mourn with us, and all who have known the gospel of truth. That is why we do not mourn alone, but many thousands from time to time in Christendom mourn with us. It has not befitted the sorry present Pope, Cardinal, Mainz, or Duke Henry to ever rejoice over the death of this man (whom he has enraged all with the truth). And | hope that the adversaries shall not long rejoice over his death, for the person is indeed different in Christ; but the mighty, blessed, divine teaching of this great man is still alive in the strongest possible way. 

5. for he was undoubtedly the angel of whom it is written in Revelation 14:6, 7, 8, which flew 


3416 


Nachlese, No. XXIX. 


W. XXI, 332*-335*. 


3417 





in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting gospel 2c. As the text says: "And | saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting gospel to preach to them that sit and dwell on the earth, and to all nations, and kindreds, and tongues, and people; and he spake with a loud voice: Fear God and give Him glory, for the time of His judgment has come, and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters. And another angel followed, saying, She is fallen, she is fallen, Babylon the great city; for she hath made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication." 

This angel who says: "Fear God and give Him glory" was Martin Luther. And that it says, "Fear God and give Him glory,” are the two pieces of Luther's teaching, the Law and the Gospel, by which all Scripture is opened and Christ is known, our righteousness and eternal life. To these two he also added this piece: "the time of his judgment has come", and taught about the right prayer and invocation to God, the heavenly Father, in spirit and in truth, as the angel Revelation 14 also says: "Pray to him who made heaven and earth" 2c. 

7 For after the doctrine of this angel shall follow another angel, which shall preach consolation to the afflicted and controverted church, and upon the adversaries lightning and thunder, eternal judgment and condemnation, as the other angel said, "She is fallen, she is fallen, Babylon the great city." Therefore the adversaries will not long rejoice in this affliction of ours, as Christ also says John. 16:20: "Your affliction shall become joy." For according to the Apocalypsis in the 14th chapter mentioned above, we see that this has gone before and is still going on. If apocalypsis is to be something, the other will undoubtedly follow. 

8 But alas! how do | run so far with my speech in this weeping and sorrow of ours? This is enough of our reasonable mourning. For we do indeed justly mourn that such a dear man, a true bishop and shepherd of souls has departed from us. But in this sorrow we should also acknowledge God's goodness and mercy towards us, and thank God that after a hundred years from the death of St. John Hus (who was killed for the sake of the truth in 1415), He has soon awakened us through His Spirit this great Doctor Martin Luther, against the antichristic doctrine of the wicked, satanic, and evil Church. 





Pabst and against the doctrines of the devil; as John Hus himself prophesied of a future swan before his death. For Hus means a goose in Bohemian. You are roasting (said John Hus) a goose now, but God will raise a swan, which you will not burn nor roast. And when they cried out against him so much that he could not answer them, he is said to have said: After an hundred years | will answer you. This he did honestly through our dear father D. Lutherum, and just began in the following year after a hundred years. Yes, we should thank God that he has preserved this dear man for us and his church in the fierce disputes, in so many hard battles, and that through him Christ has triumphed so often, now almost up to the age of thirty years, praise and honor be to the Lord Christ, for ever and ever, amen. 


(9) We should also rejoice with our dear father Luther that in the highest office of apostle and prophet, in which he faithfully carried out his command, 1) he has gone from us and departed to the Lord Christ, where the holy patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and many to whom he preached the gospel, all the holy angels, Lazarus in the bosom of Abraha, that is, in the eternal joy of all believers, are. How this will happen now, until the last day, we will learn, as St. Paul says to Philip, 1, v. 23: "| desire to depart and be with Christ", as in the stories of the apostles Cap. 7, 58. also Stephen says: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit"; and Christ to the thief: "Today you will be in paradise", Luc. 23, 43. 

10 For there is no doubt, as the Spirit of Christ was in the hands of the Father, when he said, "Father, into thy hands | commend my spirit," 2c. until the resurrection on Easter day: so shall our spirits be in the hands of Christ until our resurrection. For thus the words of Lazaro are, "But now he is comforted, but thou art tormented.” Luc. 16, 25. 

(11) What rest or comfort the faithful have in the meantime until the last day, or what restlessness or torment the wicked have, we cannot just now tell from the Scriptures. The Scripture saith, "They sleep," as Paul saith first Thessalonians, "Of them that sleep." But just as in natural sleep the healthy rest in a sweet sleep and, refreshed by it, become stronger and healthier, but the unhealthy, or those who are afflicted, and especially those in agony, sleep in a sweet sleep.

17 For this Magister Ambrosius was Doctor Martini's brother-in-law, which is why he visited him so Often in his illness, and when he spoke to him of Christ, Ambrosius also spoke of Christ, according to the dear Gospel, as | said; but when he wanted to speak to him of wife, children, goods, etc., Ambrosius knew nothing of such things, but soon fantasized happily with other words, as | said before. In particular, he said to the doctor with laughter and thanksgiving: "Doctor, thank you for coming to me, | will come to you again in the evening, and we will have a good collation together, and then | will talk to you about many happy things. Indeed, now they may both do this in eternal life, since they have both traveled there; in this life they may not have come together in this way. 

When Doctor Martinus left him, the doctor said to me: "He is gone, he does not know about any death; if we want to advise him how he should order his business, he no longer knows about this world and life, but is cheerful, laughs, suggests other things to us with his cheerful imagination, and mocks us with such words, as if he wanted to say: "I no longer know anything on earth to order or to take care of. God give me even briefly such a quiet and blessed hour of death, what more shall | do on earth? 

19th Now when Master Ambrose was buried in the hard winter, Anno 1542 Mense Januario, not long after Doctor Martinus passed with me before the grave, there he pointed with his hand to the grave, and said: "He did not know that he was ill, he also did not know that he died, and yet he was not without the confession of Christ; there he lies, he does not yet know that he is dead. Dear Lord Jesus Christ, take me also out of this valley of sorrow to yourself" 2c. 20 | often had to hear this from my dear father, and when he noticed my displeasure, at times also from my words, he said to me: "Please ask our dear Lord God to take me away from here for a short time. | can no longer do anything on earth, | am no longer of any use to you, help me with your prayers, do not ask me to live longer". Now everyone can well remember what | answered my dear father, our beloved doctor, to such words. All this shows how gladly he wanted to be rid of this life of misery in his last days and to be with Christ; with this he also sang his Consummatum est [It is finished], 


and commanded His Spirit into the hands of Heavenly Father. 

There have also been previous indications that our dear father, Doctor Martinus, would migrate to a better life. For this whole year he has often said to us that he would like to move to another place. He also left more often this year before his death than in many years before, namely to his fatherland in Mansfeld, to the bishop in Zeitz, in Merseburg, in Halle. These were simultaneous indications and prophecies that he would make this blessed journey to a better life; therefore it also happened that he departed from this life and traveled to the noble and well-born counts and lords of Mansfeld in the city of Eisleben, where he was born and baptized, no differently than he desired, except that he would have preferred to be with us, his dear wife and children, but God sent it differently. 

But that you also have a short report, dear friends, of our beloved father Doctoris Martini's blessed farewell: When he realized that his hour had come, he prayed thus: O my heavenly Father, a God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, God of all comfort, | thank thee that thou hast revealed to me thy dear Son Jesus Christ, in whom | believe, whom | have preached and confessed, whom the wicked pope and all the ungodly revile, persecute and blaspheme; | beseech thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, that my soul may be in thy command. O heavenly Father, even though | must leave this body and be torn from this life, | know for certain that | will remain with you forever and that no one can tear me out of your hands. 

And then he said three times: "Into your hands | commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, you faithful God. Item, John 3:16: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 

And hath thus fallen his hands, and in fine silence hath given up his spirit unto Christ; wherefore we ought to rejoice with him justly, as much as we could with mourning. 

Here | must remember the holy bishop St. Martin, of whom the Historia says that all heretics paled and blanched before his name. Item, that there was great weeping and mourning of all believers and true Christians over the death of St. Martin. Item, that a dispute and strife has arisen among some cities and countries. 


3422 


who were to keep the body of St. Martin and bury it with them. All this happened in the same way with this holy apostle and prophet of Christ, our preacher and evangelist in German lands, D. Martin; but | will not speak of this at length. God Himself now values and loves him, and keeps him in His bosom, who in this life was very dear to us and to the Church of Christ. In that life, when we all also hope to come to him, repay our beloved Father God. 

(24) God grant that the Spirit of God may also be upon the descendants, speaking twice as much as the great man spoke, and in the church which the dear Father planted; as the prophet Elisha asks of Elijah, when he was taken away in a storm. 

(25) If we fear or think that God has taken away the dear man because of our sin and ingratitude, let us amend our lives through Christ and call upon God our heavenly Father, so that we may remain in the blessed, pure doctrine of faith and be protected through Christ against the mobs and tyrants and against all the gates of hell. Protect, O Lord Christ, your poor Christianity, that they may praise you forever, help us, God our Savior, and save us for the sake of the honor of your name, and be merciful to our sins for the sake of your holy name, keep in your church faithful and good preachers, give them power and strength through the Holy Spirit, as the 68th Psalm, v. 12, says: "The Lord gives the word with great multitudes of evangelists." 

The insolent, abominable, great blasphemies of the adversaries, and of the obstinate priests and monks, and also our ingratitude, could well be the cause of great misfortune and punishment from God in the world; but we should ask God the Father in the name of the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, that He would do for His name's sake, and fulfill and make true the epitaph and prophecy which our dear father D. Martinus himself made for him: 


Pestis eram vivens, moriens tua, mors ero Papa. 


This is in German: Pabst, Pabst, when | lived, | was your pestilence; when | die, | will be your bitter death. 


God be praised forever through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. Let us pray 2c.

XXX. Philipp Melanchthon's address, delivered at Luther's funeral on February 22, 1546, in Wittenberg. 


Melanchthon gave this speech in Latin and had it printed immediately afterwards. In Latin it is found in Hofmann, I. e. p. 91. Casp. Cruciger translated it into German. Three individual editions of this translation appeared in the same year; then it was reprinted together with the historical report of Justus Jonas and Bugenhagen's funeral sermon at Wittenberg in 1553. In the German collections: in the Wittenberg edition (1559), vol. XII, 468 b; in the Altenburg, vol. VIII, p. 367; in the Leipzig, vol. XXI, p. 719; in Walch, vol. XXI, 342* f. and in Matth. Dresser's hist. Luth. 

1. Although | can hardly speak of my own sorrow in this affliction and grief common to our and all pious hearts, and to Christ's church, yet, because | am to say something in this Christian gathering, | will not, as has been the custom of the heathen, praise the deceased alone, but remind and admonish this honest gathering of the high, wonderful divine government of his church, and of the many dangers with which it must always struggle, of the high and wonderful divine government of his church, and of the many dangers with which it must always struggle, so that Christian hearts may all the more diligently consider and reflect on the things with which they are primarily concerned, what they should strive for, and what they should desire most from God. Item, what examples they should set before their eyes, which they should follow and by which they should judge their whole life. 

2. For although the godless hearts of the world, who regard God's word and Christian religion as nothing, think that in such a manifold disorder and disruption of human life and all regiments everything is going on roughly and without divine government, we, as Christians, should strengthen ourselves by so many and various clear and public divine testimonies, and distinguish the church of God from the other godless heaps, and certainly conclude that God governs and sustains His church by His divine miraculous counsel and power, that God governs and sustains His Church by His divine miraculous counsel and power, and to learn and understand the government of that Church properly, and to recognize with gratitude righteous teachers given by God, and to consider how they are governed by God during the time of their teaching and life, and to present to us as examples among them the high, noblest, righteous teachers, as our fathers, chiefs and predecessors, whom we should rightly follow and do them due honor. 

3. we should remember and speak of this great cause as often as the venerable D. Mar. 


3424 


Luther, our dear father and preceptor, is remembered; whom, although many godless people have been bitterly and grimly hostile and hated, we who know by God's grace that he is a high, excellent and faithful servant of Christ and preacher of the Gospel, specially awakened by God and given to us, love and praise him, and seek and consider all kinds of testimony from ourselves, which prove that his teaching is not an unchristian, seditious pretense, spread out of his own sacrilegious thirst, as many godless Epicureans hold and cry out for it. 

4 And although one is in the habit of saying much in such speeches about the deceased about special virtues of those who are to be praised, which they had or showed in their lives, | will nevertheless leave it to speak of this now, and speak only of this most distinguished, namely of his office, which he led in the church government. For pious, God-fearing hearts should certainly believe that Doctor Martin Luther blessedly taught the right, pure, necessary and salutary doctrine in the church faithfully and declared that God is always to be highly thanked for it, and that his work and diligence, faithfulness and constancy, which he showed in his teaching office, and other virtues are to be praised and praised, and that his memory should be dear and valuable to all God- fearing people. 

5. Let us now begin with what Saint Paul says, that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has ascended on high, and sits at the right hand of his eternal Father, and gives divine gifts to men, namely the teaching of the Gospel and the Holy Spirit; And that we may be made partakers of such gifts, he raiseth up prophets, apostles, teachers, and pastors, and taketh them out of this our collection, or the company of them that are disciples, and that read, and hear, and love, and keep faithfully the holy scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles. 

(6) He does not call or raise up to this work and knighthood only those who are in the ordinary government, but often does it in such a way that he challenges and fights against them through Christian teachers and preachers whom he chooses from other common classes and people. And it is quite comforting and useful to a Christian heart to see the church at all times before the eyes of the world, and to contemplate the great, high, divine good deed, how God from the beginning has always sent wholesome teachers for his church, one after the other, so that, as in a battle order, where those who are in front in the 


Nachlese, No. XXX. 





W. XXI, 344*-347*, 


3425 


The people who have been in the first place will be gone as soon as others have taken their place and followed in their footsteps. 

(7) Thus the first holy fathers followed one another in order: Adam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem. In this life, when he dwelt near Sodom, when the heathen had already forgotten the divine teaching of the holy arch-fathers, Noah and Shem, and had fallen into idolatry everywhere, Abraham was awakened by God to be the fellow servant and helper of the old pious Shem in the high divine work of preaching and spreading the pure teaching. After him followed Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, who brought the pure, wholesome teaching to light in the whole land of Egypt, which at that time was the most beautiful and most praiseworthy kingdom on earth. Then Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Elijah, Eliphaz, to whom the prophet Esaias belonged, were awakened. Then Jeremiah heard him, Jeremiah Daniel, Danielem Zacharias, then Esras, Onias, and after these the Maccabees, then Simeon, of whom it is said in Luc. 2, and Zacharias, and his son, John the Baptist, Christ himself, and the apostles. This beautiful order and succession of the highest people on earth is useful and amusing to contemplate, for it is a mighty clear and public testimony that God is always with His Church, governing and sustaining it. 

After the apostles came the following group of teachers in the Church of Christ, who, although they were not like the previous fathers, prophets and apostles, and were somewhat weaker, they were also gifted and adorned by divine testimonies, as Polycarpus, Irenaeus, Gregory Neocaesariensis, Basil, Augustine, Prosper, Maximus, Hugh, Bernardus, Taulerus and some others in other places. And although this last time, as the last and weakest age of the world, is much more fragile than the previous ones, God has always preserved some, by which he has again negated the teaching in the church and punished error, as the rest, and it is evident that now and in our time the pure teaching of the Gospel has been rekindled and brought to light much brighter and purer through the mouth and writing of the venerable D. Martin Luther. 

(9) Therefore, he should be rightly counted among the number and order of the high and excellent people whom God has specially awakened and sent to gather and restore His Church on earth; and we should know that such people are to be considered the most beautiful flower or nucleus and seed of the human race on earth. 


3426 


(10) For although some among the Gentiles may be considered and praised as great and excellent men, as Themistocles, Scipio, Augustus, and the like, they are still far from being equal to these high miracle workers, teachers, and leaders of ours, and much inferior to Esaias, John the Baptist, Paul, Augustine, and Luther. Such inequality and difference between the people God gave to the Gentiles for the benefit of worldly government and those through whom He governs His Church, we Christians should understand and consider. 

Now what are the special and distinguished pieces of true doctrine brought to light or explained by D. Luther? Luther brought to light or explained, so that he is to be praised in his course and teaching ministry, which he accomplished in his time? For we see that nowadays many people, even great ones, are crying out and complaining that the church is badly disrupted and confused, and that much unnecessary quarreling is stirring up, which no one can put right or bring back to unity. 

(12) To such cries | answer that the government of the churches in the world is always so: when the Holy Spirit punishes the world, discord and division arise. The cause and guilt of such disunity is only those who do not want to hear the Son of God, of whom the heavenly Father has commanded and said, "This is the one you shall hear. 

Doctor Luther brought to light again the true, pure 

Christian doctrine, which had previously been obscured in many noble articles, and explained it with diligence. For it is public and undeniable that there was much great, gross, and palpable darkness and error in the monks' doctrine of repentance: these he punished, and taught what true Christian repentance is, and which is the certain, true, constant consolation of hearts and consciences that are terrified of God's wrath because of sins. 14. he also explained the true Pauline doctrine, which says that man becomes righteous before God through faith alone. Item, he also showed and diligently taught the necessary distinction between the Law and the Gospel, and between the high divine righteousness of the Spirit and the outward worldly discipline or piety. He also taught what right invocation of God is and how it should be done, and rebuked the whole church from the pagan blindness and nonsense of dreaming that one can invoke God, even though the hearts lie in pagan doubt (whether God will take care of them and hear them) and flee from God in such doubt. 2c. On the other hand

3427 


He has pointed us to the only mediator, the Son of God, who sits at the right hand of the eternal Father and prays for us, not to stone or wooden images and idols, nor to dead men or dead saints, as the great multitude of godless people in terrible blindness have recourse to such idols and dead men and worship them. 

15 He also taught with faithful diligence about right good works that please God, and he so adorned, praised and defended this common Christian life of the secular rulers and of all other offices and estates that the same cannot be seen in any other writings. 

Finally, he distinguished from the right, necessary Christian works and separated the childish practice of ceremonies and other statutes and commandments introduced by men, which prevents true, truthful invocation of God. 

17 To this end, in order that the pure Christian doctrine may be propagated and preserved also to the descendants, he has interpreted the Scriptures of the prophets and apostles into the German language, so brightly and clearly that this interpretation gives the Christian reader much more light and understanding than many other great books and commentaries. 

18. he himself also wrote many _ beautiful interpretations of some books of Moses, Psalms, Prophets, Evangelists and Apostles (to that which he did in sermons from many years ago), of which Erasmus also judged that they are far better and more useful than all other interpretations whose writings are available. 

(19) And as it is written of those who rebuilt the city of Jerusalem, as in Nehemiah 4, that they worked at the building with one hand and wielded the sword with the other, so at the same time he had to fight against the enemies of pure doctrine, and yet besides this he wrote many beautiful expositions, which are full of comforting Christian doctrine, and helped many poor mistaken and troubled consciences with Christian counsel and comfort. 

(20) And since the most important parts of divine doctrine are high and far above human understanding, such as the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins and of faith, one must accept and confess that he was taught by God. Thus, many of us have seen for ourselves what high spiritual struggles he had, in which he learned that by faith one must conclude that we are accepted and heard by God with grace.

Therefore, there is no doubt that pious Christian hearts will praise and extol for all eternity the divine good deed that he has given to his church through this D. Luther. And they will first of all praise and thank God for it; then they will also publicly confess before all the world that they have improved much through this faithful man's diligence and work in writings and sermons, and that they owe him gratitude for it, although the others, Epicureans and godless people, who ridicule the entire Church of God and the Church's doctrine and government, proudly despise such high virtue and consider it useless, futile child's work, or even pure foolishness. 

(22) Nor, as the wise men say, are there vain and unending quarrels and disputations which no one can do; nor, as some scornfully say, is such a doctrine spread in the churches, whereupon one should only quarrel and quarrel; as the poets say, that a beautiful and merry apple was thrown among some virgins, whereupon they quarreled among themselves. Nor is this doctrine a dark, obscure mystery that no one can understand. For understanding, God-fearing hearts, which do not seek wanton sophistry and perversion of right doctrine, can easily see and understand, if they hold the articles of repugnant doctrine against each other, which are according to the divine doctrine, and agree with it, or not, yes, this matter of religion is already judged among all God-fearers, and certainly’ decided, which is the right, true doctrine. For since God has revealed Himself and made Himself known through the mouths and writings of the holy prophets and apostles, it should not be assumed that such words and _ writings are uncertain and incomprehensible, as the Sibyls or such dark speeches and prophecies. 

23) But that some, even good-hearted people have complained at times that Doctor Luther was a bit too hard and rough in writing, | will not argue about this, neither to excuse him nor to praise him, but leave it at the answer that Erasmus often gave about this: God has given the 1) world at this last time, in which great and severe pestilence and infirmities are rampant, also a hard, sharp physician. 

24. and if God raises up such an instrument against the enemies of the gospel, who run against the truth with great pride, insolence and iniquity, as He says to the prophet Jeremiah Cap. 1:9: "Behold, | have put my words in your mouth. 


1) "the" put by us instead of: "the". 





that you should uproot, break, destroy and ruin, and plant and build" 2c. And if he thus wanted to frighten them with Luther's hard writings, they may appeal to God about it, but they will settle with him in vain. 

God does not govern his church according to human counsel and wisdom, and does not make his instruments, whom he raises up, all alike; but this is always the case, and with all, that common conscripts and moral men do not take pleasure in great vehemence in others, whether it be good or evil. When, in Athens, Aristides saw Themistocles supporting the government with great gusto, and happily going along with him, although he gladly grudged his fatherland such an electoral ride, he nevertheless took care, as much as he could, to moderate the great speed in Themistocles and to keep it in check. 

(26) So | will not deny that such great, fierce people sometimes do too much to him, for in this weak, miserable nature and human life no one is without all infirmities. But still, if there is such a man, as the ancient Greeks said of Hercule, Simone and the like, who is not always polite, but otherwise a sincere, pious, honest man, he is to be praised as an honest, honorable man; and if he shows himself in the church (as St. Paul says) as one who fights chivalrously, and keeps faith and a good conscience, he is also pleasing to God, and to be held in all honor by men. 

27 Now we know that D. Luther was such a man, for he argued constantly and with faithful diligence about the pure doctrine and defended it at all times, so he also kept a good, honest, unharmed conscience. Thus, everyone who knew him well and was often around him must testify that he was a very kind man, and that when he was among people, his every speech was sweet, friendly and charming, and not at all insolent, impetuous, stubborn or quarrelsome; and yet there was a seriousness and bravery in his words and actions that should be in such aman. Summa, in him the heart was faithful and without falsehood, the mouth was kind and blessed, and (as St. Paul demands of Christians) everything that is true, what is honorable, what is just, what is chaste, what is lovely, what is well 2c. Therefore it is evident that the hardness he used against the enemies of the pure doctrine in his writings was not of a quarrelsome and spiteful mind, but of a great earnestness and zeal for the truth. All of us, and many other strangers who saw and knew him, must bear witness to this about him. 


3430 


28. What a beautiful and glorious speech would be made of this, if | had undertaken to praise this man, and to tell at length the whole history of his life, which he brought to three and sixty years, with constant great earnest diligence and practice in godliness, faith, calling upon God, and other Christian virtues; item, in all good and useful studies and arts! No lewd character or other misconduct has ever been found or noted in him; no word that could be used to incite rebellion or indignation has ever been heard from him, but he has always faithfully counseled and assisted in atonement and peace; he has not mixed other, foreign affairs with religious matters, or sought intrigues to strengthen his or his own power. Such wisdom and virtue is so great and strange that it cannot be brought about by human ability and diligence alone, but it requires divine grace and gift, which especially such high people, who by nature have a fierce, high and burning courage (as 1). Luther was), keep in check. 

(29) It would be too long to talk about other virtues of his, but | will mention some of them. | myself have often heard him say his prayers for the whole church with hot tears. For he took his own special time and leisure to say several psalms every day, among which he prayed to God with sighing and weeping, and often became displeased in his daily speeches about those who, out of laziness or because of their business, pretend that it is enough to call upon God with a short sigh alone. For this very reason, he said, the form and manner of prayer are prescribed for us, so that when we read or speak them, our hearts may be awakened and inflamed, and our mouths may also confess which God we are calling upon. 

(30) Therefore, we have also seen, when often great and difficult counsels of careful, swift and dangerous things occurred, that he showed a very great courage and manliness, and did not soon let himself be frightened by a little noise, nor did he become despondent because of fear, or driving and terror. For he relied on this certain foundation as on an immovable rock, namely on God's assistance and help, and did not let such faith and trust be torn from his heart. 

(31) He was also of such a high and sharp mind that he alone was able to see in confused, dark and difficult matters what should be advised and done. Nor was he so careless, as some might have thought of him, that he did not notice how things were going in the government everywhere, or did not

W. XXI, 353*-356*-. 


3431 


He did not pay attention to the people, how they would be minded; but he knew how the regiments were everywhere, and with special diligence he noticed the mind and will of all the people with whom he had to do. And although he was otherwise of high intellect and excellently learned, he nevertheless read all kinds of books and writings, both old and new teachers and scribes, as well as all histories, with which he was able to draw and apply examples to all kinds of current affairs and things with special skill. 

32) How eloquent he was, his own books and writings show that he is well and truly equal to all those who are famous as the most excellent orators. 

33) That such a noble man of such a very high intellect, in addition excellently taught, and tried and experienced through long practice, and endowed with many high Christian virtues, and especially raised up and chosen by God to help the church again (to the effect that he also warmly loved all of us as a father), has been called away and departed from this life and our means and society, as from the pinnacle in the order, that is why we bear our grief and pain. For we are now like poor, miserable, abandoned orphans, who had an excellent man for a father and are deprived of him. But still, since we owe obedience to God and must surrender to His will, we should keep a constant, eternal memory of this dear Father of ours, and not let it leave our hearts. Yes, we should thank God for him and rejoice with him in the joyful, blessed, eternal fellowship that he now has with God and the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the holy fathers, prophets and apostles, which he always desired most in his life of faith and trust in God's Son and waited for with great desire: since he now not only hears that his hard work and faithful diligence, which he had to plant and spread in the pure doctrine of the Gospel, will be praised and glorified by God and the whole heavenly blessed church in eternal life, but also he himself, as he has now been released from this mortal body, as from a dungeon, and into another, much higher, more glorious, divine school, now beholds before his eyes and recognizes the high, unfathomable, eternal essence of divine majesty, and the two natures, divine and human, united in one person of the Son of God, and the whole high, wonderful divine counsel, through which he has attained his

And because he contemplates these incomprehensible things beyond all measure, all wrapped up and covered by faith in the Word and short sayings of the divine Scriptures, he now has unspeakable joy that he sees these things manifestly before his eyes, and thanks God with all his burning heart without ceasing for this supreme benefit. 

Now he learns to understand how and why the Son of God is called in the Scriptures the Word and Image of the eternal Father, and how the Person of the Holy Spirit is the bond of unspeakable heartfelt love, both between God the eternal Father and the Son, and also between them and the whole church. In this mortal life, he learned the beginning of this high doctrine, and immediately as the first letters, and of these great things, namely, the difference between right Christian and other, pagan, false invocations, and the right true knowledge of God, which is seen, how he reveals and makes himself known through his word, and according to it, separates and separates the right true God from other, false and invented idols, he has very often spoken with great seriousness and Christianity, from the Holy Scriptures in sermons and otherwise. 

Many in this collection of ours have heard him interpret this saying of Christ John. 1, 51. (which is taken from the history of the patriarch Jacob | Mos. 28, when he saw the ladder, which touched the sky with its top 2c.), where He says: "From now on you will see the sky open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. Here he first exhorts the listeners to consider this high, glorious consolation and to press it into the heart, that the whole heaven is now certainly open to us, that is, that we now have access to God through Christ, and that the terrible, infallible wrath of God will be removed from us, and that the terrible, infallible wrath of God has been taken away, so that we have recourse to this mediator, the Son of God, and that God is now with us and dwells among us, and that those who call upon him in faith are graciously accepted, heard, governed and preserved by him. 

36. of this wonderful eternal counsel and will of divine majesty (which yet many nefarious despisers of God consider to be vain fables and nothing at all) he teaches and admonishes that one should oppose it 2) with firm faith and 


1) "of" put by us instead of: "and". 2) "him" put by us instead of: "him". 





keep the natural doubt of the human heart," and all the terrors and temptations by which miserable, afflicted hearts are made fugitive and timid, so that they cannot rise up, trust God in a right conscience, call upon Him, nor take comfort in God and be satisfied with Him. 

He then says that "the angels who ascend and descend upon the Son of Man," that is, the body of the Lord Christ, are the faithful ministers and preachers of the Gospel, who first ascend to God through our forerunner and ancestor, Christ, and receive from Him the light and knowledge of the Gospel and the Holy Spirit, and then descend again, that is, who lead and practice the ministry of teaching the Gospel among men. To this he also added this interpretation, that even the heavenly spirits, which we use to call angels, who look upon the Son of God, learn much through this vision of the wonderful union of both natures and have unspeakable joy in it; and because they are the servants and hosts of this Lord, our Savior, to protect the church, they are governed by the hand of the same. 

This great, glorious, supreme thing he now sees before his own eyes. Just as before he ascended and descended to heaven among the servants of Christ and preachers of the gospel, under this Duke Christ, so now he also sees how his angels are sent by him, and has great, heartfelt joy and pleasure with them in the contemplation of his divine wisdom and divine works. 

(39) Many of us also have in good memory how gladly and with great pleasure he used to speak of the holy prophets’ government (among God's people) and of their teachings and good counsel, also of their struggle, journey and persecution they suffered, and how God miraculously saved them, and how with great understanding and wisdom he held the whole time of God's church in the world against each other; so that he showed how great a desire he had to be with the same holy, high people. He has now joined them, and rejoices that he is to hear their living voice and speak with them; so they are again heartily glad of their schoolmate and fellow servant, receive and greet him kindly, and thus both give eternal thanks to God, who out of causeless grace and goodness gathers and sustains His church in the human race. 

40 Therefore we should not doubt at all that this our dear father, D. Luther, is with God in eternal bliss. But that is why we are justly distressed that we are now lonely and forsaken.

However, because we owe obedience to the divine will after it has been removed from us, we should know that God also wants this from us, that we are mindful of his virtue and the benefits given to us through him. We shall faithfully render this gratitude to him, and shall recognize and consider that he has been a noble, delicious, useful and beneficial instrument of God, and shall learn and retain his teachings with faithful diligence. 

In addition, his virtues, which are necessary for us to exemplify and follow diligently according to our measure, as the fear of God, faith, earnest and fervent invocation of God, faithfulness and diligence in our office, chastity and discipline, prudence, avoiding and shunning everything that may cause turmoil and other trouble, desire and eagerness to learn more and more. 

(42) And just as we often and frequently remember other great holy men through whom God governs His Church on earth, such as Jeremiah, John the Baptist, and St. Paul, so we should also often consider this man's teaching and life, and at the same time give thanks and pray to God, which is also proper to do now in this collection. Therefore, please join me in speaking to God out of a true Christian heart and faith: 

O Almighty God, Eternal Father of our Lord and Savior JEsu Christ, Who hast created and chosen for Thyself an eternal Church, together with Thy eternal, only begotten Son JEsu Christ, and the Holy Spirit; Who art wise, gracious, merciful, a just judge, true, strong, and mighty to do whatsoever Thou pleasest: We thank thee that thou hast gathered thy church out of the human race unto thine only begotten Son for an everlasting inheritance, and hast preserved the preaching ministry of the gospel, and hast also restored the same in our time by thy faithful servant D. Martin Luther, and we pray with all our hearts that you will also preserve and govern your church everywhere, and seal and preserve in us the true, pure doctrine, as the prophet Esaias prays on the 5th for his disciples. May you also inflame our hearts by your Holy Spirit, so that we may truly call upon you and govern and carry out our lives according to your word and will. 

43 Lastly, since it can be seen from the histories that the death of great, excellent teachers and rulers often means great punishment for their descendants, we, |, and all those who are commanded to teach in this church and school, hereby remind you and exhort you most strongly to avoid the present common danger and worry. 





We want to look at the course of events in the whole world. For we see that in one place the Turkish tyrant is raging and raging horribly; in another, other enemies of ours are threatening us with severe wars and devastation in the German land and among ourselves; thus, from time to time, one also finds many evil, wanton and wicked heads, who, if they are no longer afraid of Luther's seriousness, will dare to destroy and corrupt the pure doctrine of the church with great thirst and boldness. 

44. so that God may graciously avert such punishment, we should also be all the more diligent to govern our lives, customs and studies in a Christian manner, and should always have this comforting saying and comforting promise in our hearts and before our eyes, that as long as we keep, hear, learn, love, honor and promote the teachings of the gospel among us, we should be God's dwelling place or temple and church, as God's Son John 14:23 said: "He who loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. 14, 23. said: "He who loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him." 

By this gracious, loving and entirely comforting promise, we are to awaken ourselves to learn this divine doctrine diligently, and to know that the entire human race and all regiments on earth are preserved solely for the sake of God's Church. And let us now contemplate the eternal blessed companionship that we shall have in the life to come with God, Christ and all the saints, to which God has called us out of causeless grace, who, beyond all doubt, does not reveal Himself to us in vain through so many clear, wonderful testimonies, and did not send and give His only Son to us in vain, but truly and sincerely loves and cares for those who recognize and greatly esteem such His divine good deeds, amen.

1 Thessal. 4, 13-18. 


But we do not want to keep you, brethren, from those who are asleep, so that you will not be sad like the others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, God will also take with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. For this we say unto you, as the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the future of the Lord shall not appear unto them which sleep. For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the air to meet the will of the Lord, and so shall always be with the Lord. So comfort yourselves with these words among yourselves. 


Dear friends! We have Christian cause to preach this sermon on the death and passing away of our dear father, D. Martin Luther, who with all his earnestness and all his faithfulness was of the highest comfort to all of Christendom and to all the churches of the entire German nation, and who loved you here in Halle and granted you good things, through whom a very large part of the whole world was converted. Today itis seven weeks since the dear man, D. Martin Luther, at Eisleben, in his fatherland, shortly before three o'clock after midnight, blessedly fell asleep in Christ. | preached a sermon the next day after his departure from this world in St. Andrew's Church in Eisleben, when the corpse was placed in the middle of the church, truly with hot tears, and therefore | am also preaching this present sermon to remind pious Christian hearts what a great treasure they had for a time in this excellent, noble man, and what they lost in him. This sermon is divided into three parts: 

2. first, about the person of D. Martin Luther, and about his great gifts and high intellect in spiritual matters, which he had; item, how he had prepared himself for death and sleep for a whole year and longer. 

3) On the other hand, | said at that time from the text of Paul about the resurrection of the dead, and how we have known the man D. Lutherum, who for the last twenty-nine years has been opposing the diabolical lies of the 


Pabst and the unholy monks who wrote, fought and struggled against the devil's kingdom, will certainly see land hear again in eternal joy and bliss on the last day. 

4. thirdly, an admonition was given, indicating that tthe death of D. Martin Luther, like the death of all prophets, would certainly have a special power and subsequent effect against the godless, stubborn, blinded papists. 

Of the first part, of the person and the glorious gifts lof the blessed Luther, and how he so finely and neatly prepared himself for death, which is comforting to all God-fearing people to know, | would heartily wish, and would be worth wishing, that all of you who are now here in the church would have read freshly and anew the first book of Moses, which the dear father D. Martinus has interpreted so richly and beautifully. Item, in the New Testament, the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th chapters of John; as | hope that there are many of you here who have read it, and have it all in good fresh memory, then you would see all the more what a man land treasure you have lost in D. Martin Luther. Item, the Epistle to Galatians, the Psalter, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, which he translated, which now no doctor in Paris, Louvain, nor any other famous place could or would be able (indeed, if one melted all tthe papists together) to German. These and other books show what a man D. Martinus was, and what a rich spirit he had, how faithfully and diligently he worked in the Scriptures; then we would say what a man we lost in him. 

We would have a lot to say about the person, but we cannot say it all; therefore, we will remain silent labout his sharp ingenuity and excellent, sharp, high intellect, which the dear father D. Martin Luther, of blessed and Christian memory, had from his youth on, in his 18th and 20th years. | heard from many people who had been around him from his youth, who testified that they had neither seen nor experienced more excellent ingenuity than in D. Martino. Among them were D. Lange and D. Staupitz at Erfurt; they have lexperienced it because they have been with him daily. Item, so also D. Mellerstadt, who was Rector at the time when the University of Wittenberg was founded, said: "Take care of the young monk M. Martin Luther, lhe has such an excellent, perceptive mind, the likes of which do not occur to me all my life; he will certainly become an excellent man. As is also the case.

7 So also D. Martin Luther had many other rich gifts and was an excellent, powerful speaker. Item, an extremely powerful interpreter of the whole Bible. ss clerical offices also learned from him how to write an speak German properly. For he has brought forth the German language again, so that one can now speak and write German again, as many high people a testify and confess. But what an eloquent man an high writer D. Martinus had been, one has often experienced in minor matters, when he wrote bad letters. His books and writings, of which there is a great deal, testify to this sufficiently. The work praises the master. Of the same natural and high gifts | sah say nothing, but direct all God-fearing hearts an Christians to his books, postils and commentaries 2c. there they will find that they have had an excellen orator, preacher and right bishop in the man. If cod wanted Germany to have so many people an bishops, they would certainly be well served. 

(8) There was also in Luther's D. Martin an abundant grace and great light of the Holy Spirit, right true knowledge of God and Christ, which he did not diminish, but rather increased by daily diligent work in the holy divine Scriptures, with study and reading o the same, for forty whole years, so that the holy Scriptures were well known to him. He has read the Bible many, many times, so that it has been in his life, He did this from his 24th year until his 63rd year, when he died, the noble man. 

(9) | must remember here two special words which indicate his heart, as Christ said, "When the heart is full, the mouth overflows. The first, that he said: "| wish with all my heart that | understood the first article of our Christian faith of creation: "I believe in God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth". But | would like to remain a student of Abc in this article, and | Hane that few people, even the high ones, have understoo it, unless Adam, Noah, Abraham, David. But Esaias| Jeremias, and other prophets, they also understood something of it, but they all studied it in such a way that they professed to be disciples." 

The other word is that he said that he wanted the article of redemption (that God sent His Son into the world for the redemption of the whole human race) to be respected as the highest theology, as Paul respects it and all the apostles. He has well seen and understood how a high, excellent article 





Nachlese, No. XXXI. 


W. XXI, 366*-369*. 


3439 


This is: "God sent His Son into the world", that one has to study and learn enough about this article as long as one lives, and yet one will not unlearn it, although many famous theological schools, such as Paris and Cologne, have done the least, but have taught humanity against this article. More about this at another time. 

(11) Now let us talk about how D. Martin Luther prepared and sent himself for death a whole year before his end. Now that he was in his 63rd year When he came to his 63rd year, he often said such high and precious words, which could have been compared to the sermons and words of Noah, who also lived in a very evil time, and said with pain: "The world loves lies more than the pope's, monks’, and other people's fables, and in the great, bright light of the Gospel, the world has come to the point that now and henceforth many are no longer found in common sin or infirmity, but in vain blasphemy, abuses, defiance, and deliberate persistence in gross vices; no one wants to be a sinner anymore, no one wants to humble himself before God; certain punishment will follow." 

It was also a special grace and knowledge of God from the man that he prepared himself for his farewell and death a whole year before, wrote more than twenty comforting sayings in his psaltery and prayer booklet, which he always took with him, as if he wanted to say: | will one day, with God's help, take hold of one of the sayings in my last hour of death, and thus be prepared against Satan and all the gates of hell. And now these sayings, written in his prayer booklet, indicate that this man was not only a bad disciple, but also an excellent master in spiritual battles. 

13 The first saying he wrote out for his treasure and comfort is 1 Peter 5:7: "Cast all your care upon him, and he will take care of you. As if he wanted to say, "Gather all your cares and concerns into one bundle, take the greatest of your worries in one piece 2) (as the Greek word xxxxxxxxxx implies), and cast them on him, handing them over to Christ, who cares for you. According to the noble and comforting saying, the pious and holy man Doctor Martinus also cast all his cares on the Lord Christ at the hour of his death, and did not ask or worry where he would stay, but rather 


1) "the" put by us instead of: "for". 2s "Kleuen" == Kleuel, tangle. Cf. St. Louis edition, vol. Ill, 1642, 84. 


3440 


Nachlese, No. XXXI. w. xxi, 369*-372*. 3441 





Let God care for his soul, which he commanded him, as he would care for and preserve it. For all people have the worry, when they die, where they should stay. But here we hear how God cares for us all the time of our lives, even in the highest and greatest distresses, namely in the hour of death and in our last moments. | certainly could not have used Peter's saying as a consolation for the last hour of death. There you can see what kind of man D. Martinus was, and how diligently he moved the apostle's word. 

14. Item, so also the dear father has these thoughts about the saying: "Our dear faithful God, who has placed me in the high office of preaching, will certainly take care of me and keep my soul well; | will only confidently and cheerfully entrust my spirit into his hands, for the Lord will well know where my soul should remain, who has so loved it and cared for it that he gave his life, even his own soul, to redeem my soul; he is the noblest and best shepherd and bishop of all souls who believe in him, blessed forever. So he does not begin to learn from me how to care for the souls of believers in Christ; | know | will not be the first one on whom God will learn how to preserve and keep the souls of believers in Christ. St. Lawrence commanded his soul to Christ on a red-hot grate and said: Christ has taken care of it, he will preserve it. Similarly, St. Stephen, Apost. 7, 58. commanded his soul to Christ in the midst of the stones, saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit; and it is delivered from him and preserved to eternal life; and other martyrs more, so that | am not the first to command myself to Christ and to have my soul preserved. | would not willingly (he has often said) that my soul should be in my hand; for if it were in my hand, the devil would have snatched it away long ago, even in a moment, as a vulture snatches a young fowl or a bird; but out of the hand of Christ, to whom | have committed my soul, neither the devil nor anyone will snatch it; for Christ says John 10:27, 28: 'The sheep that hear my voice, and follow me, no man shall pluck them out of my Father's hand, or out of mine/" 

(15) The dear father also wrote the words of St. Ambrose in his little psalter, saying to his brothers: "I do not hope that | have lived with you in such a way that | would be afraid to live longer among you, for we have a good and faithful Lord. Neither do | know of any friend who would have cared for me more than he. 





Lord, therefore | am not afraid to die. With this saying of St. Ambrose, he, dear D. Luther, wanted to indicate that he was not afraid to live here longer; for he had lived here in the world in such a way that he should not be ashamed of his life and life. So he is not at all afraid to die, if it were God's will; for he knows that the shelter in heaven has been purchased and appointed for him through Christ. 

16 Furthermore, he also wrote in his psalter the word of a very spiritual bishop, who might well be like Ambrosio, to whom the wickedness of the world was very grievous, and he could not suffer it 2c. Christ answered him in the last hour of his death, saying: "Thou weepest and wailest: hath the world done so well unto thee, that thou wilt not suffer it? You do not want to suffer the wickedness of the world; and yet you do not want to depart from the world." Doctor Luther will not have written this saying in vain. Oh how much tribulation and cross he has had from his enemies, yes it has hurt him from the heart that the world lives so ungodly in avarice, usury, contempt and ingratitude of the word, drowned in envy, hatred and satanic poison of the papists; item, that there have also been so many false brothers who have fallen away from the pure doctrine; therefore he wanted to testify herewith that he would gladly die and lie down in the grave. 

17. item, he loved the saying: "Why are you afraid to be with Christ, who proved and showed you the highest faithfulness, that is, he gave his soul for you for a redemption and died for you; do you think the devil or the world will do for you what Christ did? How does the world prove such faithfulness? It does not, what do you want to be here? It has not given its body and soul for you, but God's Son, Jesus Christ. So now you cannot come to any place where you are better than with Christ the Lord, the Son of God, who suffered and died for you 2c." O what a beautiful and excellent saying this is, well worth remembering! 

18 This saying was also written in his prayer booklet. Matth. 19,17. It is written: "If you want to enter into life, keep the commandment of God", that is: "die". For it is decreed that all men shall and must die; therefore if thou wilt keep this saying, and enter into life, die, and thou shalt have kept the commandment of God, and shalt live; for this life is a life of sin and punishment, cast upon sin; so we cease not from sinning until we die. Now whoever is Christian and 


3442 


Nachlese, No. XXXI. 


W. XXI, 372*-375*. 


3443 





has died well, he is freed from sin and may no longer fear punishment, but is free and free from all the sorrow, grief and misery of this fleeting life. So now the sentence is also well interpreted and well spoken. Who would have interpreted the saying so masterfully that to keep the commandments of God means to die? 

(19) Therefore, from these and other many comforting sayings that he wrote, it is well to be noted how a high, excellent and spiritual man the dear father D. Martinus was, who prepared and prepared himself for death for a whole year and longer, as if he had indicated with it: | want to leave, | want to keep the commandments of God, | want to go from this life and evil world to a better and different life and world. 2c. That is why he said the evening before, on Wednesday 1) (before he passed away): "When | have tolerated my dear countrymen, the Counts of Mansfeld, here in Eisleben, then | will go home and lie down in my coffin, and give my body to the worms to eat. These words indicate that he dealt with death and the hour of death, and that he did not shy away from parting with this life. These sayings all give enough to understand how rich, high, great God's spirit the man had, and was even a noble man, the like of which the world has not had in a long time. This | have briefly said about the first piece, about the person of D. Martini. Now we will deal with the other piece as well. 

The other part of this sermon is about the resurrection of the dead, because we will see our dear father, the venerable Lord D. Martinum Lutherum, who has now departed from us from the world, again on the last day. For St. Paul clearly tells the Thessalonians that Christ will lead with him those who have fallen asleep in him. A Christian takes comfort in words. He who does not take comfort in words, let him not think that he is a Christian; for this is such a rich comforting text, which cannot be paid for with gold. A Christian holds on to this, sets his comfort on the words of Paul, and firmly believes that he will rise again on the last day with all Christians. A godless man, an Epicurean sow, does not put his comfort on the words of Paul, but on money and goods, on his usury, avarice 2c., because he neither knows nor believes that he will rise again at the last day, and those who lived before with and after him will see again 2c. Paul 


1) That is, February 17. 





but says: "The HErr will come with a field cry" 2c. The Lord is great, so also his triumph and glory must be great. But an Epicurean (as now said) asks nothing of the words, nor does he take them up. But to a Christian heart they are pearls and precious jewels. So Paul also considers these words a special and high secret, that here he tells the Christians (since the world knows nothing about it) about the resurrection of the dead, and says: 


So now comfort yourselves with these words among yourselves, 


21. as if to say, Behold, | will reveal to you a heavenly mystery, namely, that the world and all men whom you see here, young and old, rich and poor, will have to go down to the earth, that is, die and be buried, both Christians and unbelievers, and finally rise again at the last day with their bodies, flesh and blood (regardless of the fact that they are eaten by worms in the earth, rotting and decaying) in great glory, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, v. 42, 43. am 15, v. 42. 43. which also testifies, "It is sown corruptible, and shall rise incorruptible; it is sown in dishonor, and shall rise in glory.” 

22 Therefore, even if a good friend dies, we should have the comfort that we will see him again at the last day. Thus Paul consoles himself that even if he is strangled and killed by the bloodthirsty tyrant Nerone in Rome, he will rise again at the last day together with all men. Item, so also all children who have been born and are yet to be born (for this life means to be born, to live and to die) will rise with their bodies. Then a happy and blessed day will come, yes, "the day of redemption,” as Christ calls it in the Gospel of Luke 21:28, after the vicissitudes of life and death, the happy day will come, and on that day one will no longer be free, nor let oneself be free, nor beget children; then one will no longer be lame, blind and sick, item, no longer die, mortality will cease, and immortal eternal life will begin. So now Saint Paul continues: 


The Lord will come down from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first, then we who are alive and remain 2c. 


3444 


Nachlese, No. XXXI. 


W. XXI, 375*-378*. 


3445 





This is a beautiful golden text and comfort for Christians, which we should keep all our lives, and comfort ourselves with it, of which St. Paul says here, namely, that the Lord will come with a shout, and that we will rise again and be with the Lord forever, of which the world knows nothing. It neither comforts nor rejoices in this text, but only in its thalers, money and goods, and now wants to say this much to St. Paul: Dear Christians, even if you lose me, who am your bishop, preacher, pastor and shepherd in Christ, nevertheless | will rise again, and you, as my parishioners, will certainly see me again in this world, just as you will see me in eternity. 

24. Since he now says, "Christ will come with a shout." The shout will be great, with the trumpet of God's archangel. Even those who are dead will awake, and first of all those who have fallen asleep in Christ in the right, pure faith will rise from the dead before and after, and after that, together with those who are still alive, they will be drawn to meet Christ in the air, as Christ also says John 5:28, 29: "Truly, | say to you, this is what will happen. 5:28, 29: "Verily, verily, | say unto you, The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment." At the same time, our dear father D. Martin Luther, of Christian memory, will also rise from the dead with the body, face, hands, and feet that he had, and as we have seen [him] here, with the blessed mouth, since he has now preached God's word purely to the German land for 29 whole years, but with a brightly clarified body, which will shine like the sun, of which Christ says Matth. 13, 43. and Daniel the prophet in chapter 12, v. 3: "The teachers shall shine like the brightness of heaven, and they that teach righteousness like the stars for ever and ever." Now because O. Martinus has been a great teacher, and has shown them much to righteousness, he will also have a beautiful bright shine before others, as we will see, if God wills it. 

Job, in the 19th chapter, v. 25, 26, says of the resurrection: "| know that my Redeemer lives, and he will raise me from the earth, and afterward | shall be clothed with this skin of mine, and in my flesh | shall see God. Knowing this is a great comfort for Christians, that they will be resurrected with their bodies and see God in their flesh. Job speaks completely and 





even the same as Paul says here. In the same resurrection on the last day we shall see the high and dear man whom we have now lost, D. Luther; indeed, not only will we see him, but he will also speak kindly again to us, whom he knew here in the world, to whom he preached, whom he converted through the Word of God, not only to us, but to the whole heavenly host of dear patriarchs and prophets, about the hard battles and disputes against the kingdom of the troublesome devil, which he had much of here in the world, about the great and high tentationibus, which he suffered and endured from the devil during the 29 years. For Martin Luther has had many hard battles with the devil, especially in great affairs, as in Carolstadt; item, over the great important affairs at Augsburg on the Imperial Diet; item, over the great cause of the Sacrament, the Anabaptists, Antinomians, and others 2c. That also D. Martinus himself has often said: "What | have suffered and endured for the sake of the teaching of the dear Gospel, which God has now revealed to the world, no man shall know of me here in this world, but on that day it will be revealed. Now on the last day he will tell us, and we will hear, what he did not want to tell or reveal to any man here in this world, about the great victories of the Son of God, which he accomplished through him, against sin, devils, papists, false brothers 2c. He will tell us all this together with what glorious revelation he had when he began to preach the Gospel, so that we will marvel at it, and praise God for such victories as he received, as also the 84th Psalm, v. 8, says: "They receive one victory after another." But no satanic monk, or other stiff-necked pope, knows a word about it; and even if they read it in the Scriptures, they do not believe it. 

26 And now the resurrection of the dead shall come quickly. Those who have fallen asleep in Christ first, and then those who are still alive, will be twitched and taken up to meet the Lord in the clouds, and so will always be with the Lord. Would to God that such a day of the Lord would come soon, and that we would be twitched and taken to meet the Lord before we sit down at the table, and yet deliver us from the sorrow and misery that we must suffer here in this evil world, and made us free from the great unfaithfulness of the world, item, the insatiable usury, avarice, envy, backbiting, ostentation, arrogance and other vices, item, also from the abominable blasphemy and reviling, persecution, murder and bloodshed, idolatry, and the evil of the world.

The end of the desperate godless papists, priests, monks, nuns, etc., they do it too much and too roughly. 

We should always pray for such a blessed day. Oh, how blessed, comforting and joyful the next day will be, when everyone will know each other better than here in this miserable life, the wife the husband, the husband the wife, the children the parents, the preachers their listeners, and so they will talk to each other without interruption, be with each other, praise and glorify God with each other in the great General Synod, in the eternal church, together with the dear angels, forever and ever. 

(28) Now this (says St. Paul) you Thessalonians will hardly and weakly believe; for it is a high article of faith that we who are rotten and burned 2c. will rise again, know one another, talk with one another, and praise God forever. Reason is annoyed and offended by this article, for it cannot comprehend how the body, which the worms eat, item, is turned to powder and ashes by fire, should rise again and become alive. Now when one preaches about the article of the resurrection of the dead, the world laughs at it and thinks it is just a fool's hoax, as we see in Acts 17:18. 17:18 When Paul preached in Athens about the article of the resurrection of the dead, some began to say, "What does the fool want to say?" Item, when Paul preached before the king Agrippa about the resurrection of the dead, Festus said with a loud voice: "Paule, you are raving, the great art makes you raving", Apost. 26, 24. 

29) See what the world thinks of the article; it is 

nothing; the article's preachers are called fools and foolish people; just as the Pope of Rome, the bishops and cardinals also call us Germans fools and foolish people, because we preach, believe and think that we will rise with our bodies on the last day and see God. 2c. (30) The mystery of the resurrection of the dead has been revealed to us by our dear faithful God through His holy divine Word and Gospel, which mystery the world laughs at, but the true church and poor Christianity have eternal living consolation in it. A Christian should remember this revealed mystery every morning when he gets up, and say to himself: "Well, | know that a day will come when God will raise again all those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and that all our bodies will rise again who have done good and believed in Christ, to eternal, imperishable life. 2c. 





So a Christian should always remember and speak to himself of the same day and future of Christ, so he would be more patient in all kinds of sufferings, crosses and temptations. 

The obdurate, blind, wretched papists do not have a single thought about it, yes, they blaspheme, persecute the holy gospel, which reveals to us the great mystery of the resurrection of the dead and shows that our soul's salvation depends on it (for he who does not believe the article of the resurrection of the dead hears preaching in vain, believes in vain, remains in sin, and is lost, as Paul says, 1 Cor. 15:17). With such people, who blaspheme, do not want to accept, hear or believe the gospel, one should neither send nor have anything to do with them, one should flee and avoid them, but the devil himself; for a hardened, hardened papist is the devil himself; they have no faith, and believe in the window and out the door again. 

32 Therefore St. Paul will say to the Thessalonians in these words, "I have taught you the mystery of the resurrection of the dead at the last day; but |, Paul, who have diligently shewed you these things in the Word and Spirit of God, will not remain here forever to be your preacher. Nero will be able to do a trick and have me killed, so that | will have to stop preaching. Even though the world will kill me out of great wrath, | will rise again on the last day with all of you, and you with me. This is what the Thessalonians consoled and rejoiced with St. Paul. Our dear father Doctor Martin Luther, German prophet and preacher, consoled and rejoiced over this, and had the same thoughts as Paul, that even though he would die and be buried, and be carried away by us, as his dear parishioners and listeners, into another and better life, he would nevertheless rise again on the last day, and see us all in eternal joy forever. We should also take comfort and rejoice that we will see and hear our dear father and preacher again in the eternal life to come. God help us all through Christ, amen. That is enough said from the other piece this time. 

Thirdly, we should note in this sermon that the death of the high prophet D. Martini will certainly have something great behind it. For before two years have passed, we shall know it, and before other papists, canons, priests, monks and nuns, who, whether they are aware of the death and passing away of D. Martin, or not, will know it.

tini Lutheri, he will leave great power behind him, they will wish after some years that D. Luther was still alive, they would like to obey him now, and if they could, they would dig him out of the earth again, but it will take too long. If they had followed his warning and faithful advice in his time, during his life, it would have been useful and good for them in body and soul. 

34 We read in the holy scriptures and chronicles, that ever and anon, when the times were evil, swift, dangerous, and worst, the highest and greatest prophets and men of God lived, as, before the flood of sin Noah, before the burning and destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Lot; after that Elias, Elisaeus 2c. But soon after the death of every high prophet and great man, a great and terrible punishment always followed. Thus we read in the book of Judges that when Gideon died, the Jews became godless, as itis written in the book of Judges, chapter 8, v. 33: when Gideon died, the children of Israel turned back, whored after Baalim, and made Baal their god, and set up idolatrous Baalite worship services; so God's punishment and ruth soon followed. Thus, after the death of the man D. Martini, a terrible punishment will certainly follow over Germany, where it does not improve; and that especially over the godless, stubborn, desperate papists, monks, priests and nuns before, without any doubt. 

The Historia of St. Augustine indicates that he was 70 years old, even close to ten years older, than D. Mart. Luther. He had been in his preaching ministry for forty years, so that he had also preached ten years longer than D. Luther. Since he was close to death and was to die, he saw that his fatherland Africa would suffer hardship and would go badly, which made him lament very much; as we now want to see that the German country will go badly after such a bright light. And even though St. Augustine worried that his fatherland would lose the Gospel after his death, God still sent it so that two hundred years later the pure Word of God was still preached in Africa; but this was done and obtained through prayer. Since we are now also concerned that we might lose the Word, let us also begin to live repentantly, and to pray earnestly that God would preserve His Word even longer after the death of D. Mart. Luther, as he did in the time of St. Augustine. May the merciful God grant this through Christ our Lord, Amen. 





36 O, how often has the dear father, Doctor Martin Luther, so earnestly exhorted Germany to repentance, and has grieved them, as in the house postilion on the gospel of the destruction of Jerusalem, Luc. 19. item, in the 110. Psalm; in the book to the clergy at Augsburg; item, in the exhortation to his dear Germans, where they will not amend themselves and renounce idolatry, and avoid idolatrous people (as he then also preached here in Halle, faithfully and earnestly warned), one should avoid the godless papist monks, nuns and their like, nuns and their like, and flee, have nothing to do with them, or God will visit them, punish them, and take the word away again completely, and again send terrible errors, as before. Now one should take such a warning of the good man and prophet to heart, and put away idolatry, and sweep out the old leaven, and not make oneself a party to the papists' idolatry and sin, so that one does not lose the word again. But the papists should be especiallyware of others, as such urges will come home to them if they do not mend their ways. John Hus prophesied before he was burned that a swan would come after him, over a hundred years, which they would have to have and yet not fry. Now this man was our dear father D. Martin Luther, who preached the truth to the pope, bishops, cardinals, priests, monks 2c. and to all the world, neither feared nor shied away from anyone, whom they did not like to roast or kill, as they often had in mind and would have liked to do. But they missed it, he died blessedly in his dear fatherland at Eisleben. Just as John Hus prophesied before his death (as we have heard) and the prophecy came true, so too did D. Martin Luther often said when talking about the papists and monks: Well, be satisfied, after my death ask where the monks and papists are; they will all die and perish, as the chaff is scattered by the wind, because they do not want to be instructed from God's word, and do not want to depart from their error, but remain badly in error, idolatry and godlessness; no punishment, teaching, admonition or pleading helps them, as David said in the 36th Psalm, v. 4. Psalm, v. 4, also complains, saying: "They also do not let themselves be instructed to do good. This is what the papists do, and that is why it will happen to them, as he further says in the 37th Psalm, v. 35: "I have seen an ungodly man who was defiant, and he was

and grew like a laurel tree; when one passed by, behold, he was gone; | asked for him, but he was nowhere to be found. So the papists are also defiant: when they have a little air, they are proud, pose as if they wanted to eat us, and now especially, after dear Luther's death, they are very happy. It would be better for them if they would let themselves be instructed and repent, then they would be helped and saved in body and soul. But if they do not, God's eternal judgment and punishment will come upon them, namely, hellish fire and damnation. For whoever does not repent must perish and die, as Christ Himself says in the Gospel, and if they think they stand firm, they are gone like the wicked. 

37. the dear father, D. Martinus Luther, himself has made him an epitaph and prophecy of the papacy, which thus reads: Pestis eram vivens, moriens ero mors tua, Papa. 


[In life | was your plague, in death | will be your death, O Pabst]. 


The papists may well see that they repent of having blasphemed, desecrated, persecuted, condemned the gospel as a doctrine of the devil and as heresy for 29 whole years, and of having chased away, murdered, drowned and hanged the Christians for this reason, that they now begin to believe and accept the gospel and to promote this. If Luther has not been a plague to them during his life, pushing and frightening them much with writing and preaching, then he will certainly be a death and final eradication of all monasticism and other idolatry and abominations after death. May God help them to follow and convert, and to believe and accept the Word of God with us, and finally to be saved, amen. 


XXXII Luther's Epitaph. 


This document was published in a single edition in Wittenberg in 1546. In the editions: in the Wittenberg (1559), vol. XII, p. 480 b; in the Jena (1562), vol. VIII, p. 388 b; in the Altenburg, vol. VIII, p. 861; in the Leipzig, vol. XXI, p. 736 and in Walch, vol. XXI, 386". 1) 


1) Walch adds to the indication of the locations: "has been brought to the German parts of Luther.... at Eisleben". Is this supposed to say: This inscription is found in a church at Eisleben? Because this writing is not found in the Eisleben parts. 


God and his word remain eternal. The Pabst's power will soon pass away. 


In Eisleben is my fatherland, in Saxony God has sent me, from Wittenberg, the precious city, through me God has given his word. Thus the papal empire overthrown And its tyranny shortened. In my dear fatherland | have fallen asleep in God. In Wittenberg | lie in the grave, praising God for his given gift. Soon | shall rise again, With Jesus Christ to joy enter. 


Martin Luther | am called, sent by God to the German country, which was completely seduced by the Pope's and the devil's teachings with lies and idolatry, false worship and hypocrisy. The right pure word of God about Jesus Christ was not heard. That creates the Pabst's three-crowned Hui, cheated us of body, soul and property. God, out of mercy, has had mercy on such a great affliction. To show the poor people, How he has promised, Before the last day the antichrist, The devil's child with his cunning. He has awakened me to the ministry of preaching, he has put me through great journeys and hardships, he has revealed his holy word to me, which | have also freely taught without fear. 


And | have proven clearly by Scripture, and will also remain true forever: The Pope is the Antichrist, His origin is from the devil's dung. With all the plates of his kind is even the devil's people. Their doctrine and work they show freely, Who is the father of them all, God's commandment they despise, In addition all divine work ridiculed. Everything that Christ taught, that the pope even reversed. Mocked Christ's blood and death. He has extinguished the benefits of his suffering, he has consecrated the people to his own work, and he has fed them with vain poison. Has proudly roared at his power, his devilish malice richly fulfilled. The damage done by the pope, no human tongue can pronounce.

What lies he has forged, that his platelet has forged. In great fornication they lived. In all disgraces they also floated. They still wanted to rule the people, Through their works lead to heaven. Their sin is so cruelly heavy, the earth can no longer bear it. From such their beautiful fruit The world has taught’ Evil discipline, And all sin so high brought, That almost with sin the sky cracks. Such great sin of the whole world | have clearly shown by the word. 


Also God's wrath and heavy Ruth Often announced, to the people's benefit. And lured everyone to repentance. But the greatest number remained obdurate. The pure gospel of Christ, the Son of God, | have taught with all faithfulness, | have converted many poor sinners. Consecrated to Christ, their consolation, Who redeems us all from sins. He is the pure lamb tender, Who was sacrificed for sin. Death has no power over those who are sprinkled with his blood. The devil's bite does no harm. He who sees this honorable serpent. He is the way to salvation, the life and also the truth. He who trusts in Christ completely. He will not die eternally, he goes through this death appearance to eternal life happily. There is no comfort and salvation for sinners, for only the Savior Jesus Christ, for our works and holiness do nothing for salvation. But we shall be obedient to God, live purely according to his will. For God's word gives holy juice, And curbs sin with its power. What God's law makes hard for us, becomes easy through Christ's spirit and teaching. Whoever remains steadfast in this truth, Has become incorporated in Christ, And is certainly a blessed child, Completely free and free from all sin, Only watch and beware. 

From false teaching, the devil's sting. For Christ makes the soul healthy, the Pabst's teaching wounds it with poison. 


1) "taught" == learned. 


Christ's kingdom brings eternal good, the pope's kingdom eternal harm. In Christ alone is salvation, in the pope is death and the torment of hell. 


On this God's teaching and light The pope, the villain, is enraged, With wrath he sprays hellish fire, The malice glows from his eyes. Aroused his infernal court servants, his priests became mad and blind, set upon me their whole school. All the scholars from the infernal pit Tried on me all their art; Their lies helped nothing, was in vain. My right teaching kept the prize And penetrated all the land with diligence. The emperor and the whole empire, The princes, bishop, all alike. They wanted to wipe out my teachings, but gained little honor. , 


| was placed before the whole kingdom. There | stood as a strong hero, My teaching was known in humility, | was not moved by its great appearance, The whole world was against me, In God alone | trusted. He has kept his word firmly, And protected me in the best way. Many a scatterbrain was found, And put all their strength into me. | have all of them through God, not to mention that none will arise again. 2) Although | have had trouble and toil, God has always rewarded me. 


The whole holy scripture | have translated with diligence from God's gift. Through it, the German country gained great knowledge beyond all measure. | have written many useful things from God's spirit, whoever wants to read it. My writing touched the Christian state and led it on the right path. All God's order | have also brought fine Christian in right use. What benefit and piety | have achieved in the whole world from God's power, That devout Christians know well, For such a thing one should also thank God. For God has done a great miracle through me before the last day. Therefore | praise God's work, who gave me strength and power.

Whoever recognizes such divine work, Follow God, do not be blinded. The treasure of grace is at the door, God calls and says: Come all! The year of jubilee is now alldo, Who believes and needs, be heartily glad. The golden gate is open, the bridegroom comes, run who can. Who now wants to go in with me, Watch and do not stay outside. God will soon close the door, Then you will truly find no peace. Whoever thinks I'm a prophet. Sent by God at the end of the world, My faithful warning pleases him, And joins my teaching. The last day will soon come, Then God will awaken young and old. According to his word and my teaching God will judge in all honor. 


Oh that the people believed that, they would think twice. But God has counted all his sheep, from his hand not one falls. The dear God will mercifully, through Jesus Christ, have mercy on the poor of all Christendom, who are now in peril and great suffering; govern them by your Spirit in the word of faith most of all. For false doctrine also guard them, Oh, dear God, by thy goodness. Keep them always in unity by thy great mercy. Likewise all thy servants, So, O God, keep thy word pure. Preserve them continually. That they may not be afraid of anyone, That they may tell the truth to everyone, As | have done by your grace. Be diligent also in word and prayer, Lead a holy life well. 


Also | beseech thee, thou faithful God, By thy Son Christ's blood and death, Let thee with earnest command The dear Lord Elector mine To Saxony, and his whole family. My doctrine is often disgraced. Thou hast granted him thy divine word, Which he protected and gladly heard, So that thou honoredst him very highly, His praise and name greatly increased. Has loved me and always nourished me. That is why God has given him enough. 


Lord Jesus Christ, hear my plea, Your grace and help share with him, And give him comfort in all his peril, Protect him from his enemies. Thy favor and thy grace from him turn not away. Give him, as me, a blessed end, Likewise all his subjects, Who have accepted God's word. All Christian sovereignty protect also steadily, Leave them not, hear their prayer. 

And all Christian people alike Help through death into the eternal kingdom. Amen, amen, that will happen. For God's word remains eternal. 


XXXIII. epitaph to be read on Luther's tomb at Wittenberg in the castle church. 


From Hofmann's mem. sec. Funeris et sepulcri Lutheri, p. 86, 

in Walch, Vol. XXI, 392". Hic prope Murtini rursus victura Lutheri In parvo tumulo molliter ossa cubant. Quae prius horrendis errorum pressa tenebris, Atque operum obscura nube sepulta fuit, Hoc monstrante iterum paiace est gratia Christi, Quaeque Deo acceptos nos facit esse, fides. Namque superstitio cum regnum caeca teneret, Et premeret longo dogmata vera situ, Ille Dei adflatu monitus, verboque vocatus, Lucem Evangelii sparsit in orbe novam. Instructusque tuba, Paulinae et fulmine linguae, Exploso, coepit vera docere, dolo. Utque agnum in media Baptista ostendit eremo, Qui pia pro populi victima labe foret: 

ic quoque monstravit te, maxime Christe, Lutherus, Cum totus tenebris obrutus orbis erat. Et legis tabulae, quas in Sinaide Moses, Allisus fregit rupe, propheta Dei, Quid distent Evangelio, quod pectora sanat, 

onscio quae culpae, terruit ira Dei. Hoc prius amissum discrimen reddidit orbi, Essent ut Christi munera nota magis. Arguit Ausonii fraudes ac impia regna Pontificis, populo quae nocuere Dei. Pollutasque monens vitare idola per aras, Ad verum adduxit corda levata Deum. 

Magnanimusque Deo cursum servante peregit, Insidias contra multiplicesque minas.

Finally, the immersion or sprinkling of the child itself contains the lawful use commanded by Christ. The same must be said of the Lord's Supper.

saying, which is repeated in all schools. (3) But here we have to examine in passing the question of worship, which some want to establish and prove under this pretext as a matter that is nof necessary: Christ must be worshipped. Christ is in the Lord's Supper. Consequently, the Lord's Supper must be worshipped. This objection can easily be answered if the words of Christ are diligently considered. For he does not say, Receive and worship; but steals, we are to eat and drink. For the action prescribed by Christ alone, and the worthy eating and drinking, is the

The twelve evangelical counsels, falsely invented by the sophists. 


I. Poverty. Matth. 19,21: "If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have" 2c. 

2. denial of oneself or obedience. Luc. 9, 23.: "Whoever wants to follow me, let him deny himself." 

3. chastity. Matth. 19,12.: "Some are cut off, who cut themselves off for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." 

4. not to repay evil with evil. Matth. 5:44: "Do good to those who are aping you." 

Suffering from injustice. Matth. 5, 39: "If someone gives you a blow on the right cheek, offer him the other also. 


3460 E. opp. V. arg. IV, 450-452. gleanings, no. XXXVII. 


3461 





6) The multiple sufficiency 1) (Supererogatio) of works of mercy. Luc. 6, 30: "Whoever asks you, give to him." 

7. abstain from oaths and useless words. Matth. 12, 36.: "Men must give an account of every useless word." Matth. 5, 34.: "However, you shall not swear." 

8. avoid the opportunity to sin. Matth. 18, 9: "If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out." 

9. do prudent [good] works, lest we become hypocrites. Matth. 6,1.: 2) "Take heed to your alms, that ye give them not before men." 

10. do what you teach. Matth. 23, 3: "They say it well and do it not"; therefore he advises the hypocrite, Matth. 7, 5: "First pull the beam out of your eye. 

11. not to worry about food. Matth.6, 31.: "You shall not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat?" 

12. brotherly punishment. Matth. 18, 15: "If your brother sins against you, go and punish him between you" 2c. 

This last, however, is understood only of venial sins, for in regard to a mortal sin the commandment is always obligatory, but not forever, namely, as long as the punishment seems useful. 

The evangelical { commandment } "divorced. 

the evangelical { Rath } 

The commandment is the general teaching of God, which obligates every man at all times under the penalty of mortal sin. 

The Council is the special teaching of God, which alone obligates under the penalty of a venial sin, for the time of this life. 


This is the quite general theology of the Pabst and the Sophists, and so recognized that even St. John Hus approved of it in the very book for the sake of which he suffered death by fire, for he brings all this up almost word for word, in the 7th chapter. 

But also the Sorbonne in its verdict against the condemned Luther does this out 

1) Luther would probably have given it like this: Thun von 


Uberlangenen Werken der Barmherzigkeit. 2) In the editions: Matth. 7. 


3) that this is too burdensome for the Christian religion, if one has to take it for commandments. Hence there is that famous dispute among them, whether the law of Moses is heavier or that of the gospel? And the so great men, in fact extremely wise, decide as follows: 

The law and the gospel, as far as difficulty is concerned, relate to each other as to what is prominent and what is not (sicut excedentia et excessa), because, as far as doing away with ceremonies is concerned, the gospel is easier, but as far as keeping the mind (animi) is concerned, the gospel is more difficult, because the law forbids the hand, the gospel the mind, as the Magister 4) says in the 3rd book, distinct. 40. 


Here learn, Christian brother, how much you owe (by the grace of God) to this teaching, which is restored at this time. For what (I beg you) does this Pharisaic theology finally leave us even from Moses or even from the holy ten commandments (to say nothing of Christ)? 

For the eternal memory of the cause, but especially for the honor of the Redeemer, mau must keep this in living memory and make it great against the quite insolent tongue-thrashers, the defenders of the papist abomination. 

For from this you see what those perfect men, the monks and the priests, vowed, since they first taught that the counsels (that is, God's commandments) were not necessary for a Christian to be saved, and then vowed with a new idolatry the [counsels] that had been disfigured into human statutes, rather into doctrines of the devil. For, to make the commandments of God into counsels, is that not a human statute, yes, a terrible and diabolical blasphemy? 

[Our soul has escaped like a bird from the bailiff's rope, the rope is broken and we are free. 

This is what our help has accomplished in the name of the Lord. D. Martin Luther.

Our greeting before. Venerable, reverend, dear devotee! We graciously inform you that the highborn prince, our dear cousin, brother-in-law and godfather, Duke Henry of Saxony, came here yesterday. Now we note that he would have special inclination to see you and to hear your sermon. 2) Since no one knows what God Almighty might do by such a coincidence, we graciously request that you be up in Wittenberg this night at about two o'clock before daybreak, submit to it, and as soon as you arrive, report this to us at this hour. You do us a favor, which we are also inclined to recognize with grace. Date Torgau, Thursday after Jubilate [May 4] Anno Dominini XXXI.

Luther's postscript to a letter from Melanchthon to Brenz. 


We have dated this document (No. 1813) just as DeWette did: "Perhaps in June," but the above dating results from the fact that Cordatus, who came to Wittenberg toward the end of May, read and honored this letter, but then Melanchthon enclosed it with a letter to Camerarius before the end of May. (Erl. Briefw., Vol. IX, 


p. 21.) 


No. 17 99b. (Wittenberg.) (End of May? 1531.) 


To the Chancellor Gregor Briick. 


This document notified by us sub. No. 1825 will have to be placed here. In the second line of the text, with Seckendorf and the Erlanger Briefwechsel, Vol. IX, p. 21, it is probably more correct to read: "Cardinals" instead of: Concils, which Burkhardt offers. The Erl. Briefw. states that this letter will have been written in the first period of the peace negotiations opened by Cardinal Albrecht of Mainz and Elector Ludwig of the Palatinate with the Protestant estates, especially Chursachsen and Hessen. On May 26, the Mainz envoys, Christoph Tiirk, the Hessian chancellor, and Wolfgang von Bach, bailiff of Querfurt, went to the Elector to initiate the peace negotiations. Instead of the content we have set, we would like to assume something like: Luther advises not to reject the peace negotiations with Mainz.

| No. 1820. No. 1848a. meee tora (Wittenberg. ) October 21, 1531. (?) To Hieronymus Nopus in Zwickau. 4 ; fee This letter cannot be addressed to Cordatus, as Buddeus and 0 Matthias Knutzsen and his housewife De Wette state, this results from the fact that he was already in Magdalena in Husum. 


Wittenberg with Luther since the end of May. - Hieronymus Nopus, a native of Herzogenaurach near Erlangen, inscribed June 1, 1519, was a teacher of Greek at the Zwickau school from 1519 to 1537, then Rector in Schneeberg until 1543, from where he came to Regensburg as gubernator wt summus inspector Ecclesiae after becoming Doctor of Theology in Wittenberg. From here he was expelled by the Interim. In the process of returning to Regensburg, he died in transit in Nuremberg on Aug. 9, 1551 (Erl. Briefw., vol. IX, p. 50.). 


The letter, which bears the heading under No. 3151: "To unnamed parents" and is dated Oct. 25, 1544, will have to be ransferred here with the above address and time determination. For according to the Erl. Briefw., vol. IX, p. 114, the Copenhagen Ms. 1393. f. 322 contains the address: "To the honorable and irtuous Matches Knutzsen and Magdalenen, his legitimate wives, lat Husem Birger 2c., my favorable good friends." This manuscript lalso has the year 1531. In 1529, on June 7, Jodannes Knutzen (read in Alb. p. 135: Kuntzen), Dioc. Sleswitzen, was inscribed. heS will be the deceased. It cannot be assumed that he was still la student in Wittenberg in 1544; even until 1534 his stay there ould have been unusually long. The Paulus Hockel, Dioc. Sleswiccen, was probably the preceptor mentioned in the letter.

Luther's concerns about a religious peace. 


The concern we reported in No. 1950a does not belong to the year 1532, as we assumed according to Seidemann, but it is to be placed in the above-mentioned time, which the Erl. Briefwechsel, vol. XI, p. 131 f. has convincingly demonstrated. The pieces marked P. M. are not proposals of Philipp Melanchthon," but points of the peace draft, which Elector Albrecht of Mainz worked out with the Palatine plenipotentiary Wilhelm von Habern in the fall of 1531. On December 27, a discussion took place in Bitterfeld between the chancellor of Magdeburg, D. Turk, and the chancellor Brick. For this discussion, Luther briefly gives his opinion on the above points of the Mainz proposal.

To Justus Jonas. 


This letter concerns the marriage dispute of Gregor Iheisa in Wittenberg, as can be seen from Spalatin's inscription. In 1533, the dispute was not yet over on July 10 (cf. No. 1991), so the letter is attributed to the year 1532 with the Erl. Briefw., vol. IX, p. 252, must be assigned to the year 1532. 


No. 1861.

Thus, as the Erl. Briefw., vol. IX, p. 134, indicates the address of this letter should be, for in the old editions it is consistently addressed to a princess, and only the Leipzig edition and later ones have changed this to: "To an unnamed prince." But to whom this letter is addressed is not known.

On January 13, 1532, Gerhard Wilskamp had sent Luthern the "Apologia des Fraterlevendes tho Herporde" for review and asked him for his written judgment on it. Luther fulfilled this wish by the present testimony, which was written at the end of the booklet, which was sent back to Herford with the letter No. 1870.

Grace and peace. Worthy, dear doctors! We have received the booklet, signed and corrected by your dear ones, with great desire and thanksgiving, together with your letters. Nothing more necessary could have happened to us at that time, because (want) of the wanton promise about us from the preaching chair was beyond measure. The worst devil from hell has caused this game, but he will not succeed, God willing, but will be broken by you, so that the matter will become good again by God's grace and we will be united again in Christ, who has also often united his apostles. Since people are being sent to you against us, | beg and admonish you in Christ not to be moved against the truth of the booklet, nor with multiplicity of witnesses or circumstantiality of things, even if an angel from heaven would present you with something else. For we have written before God in the presence of Jesus Christ, and are yet required to read it before our whole city, confident in God that amen, yea, and truth, are found therein.

Out of the desire of your sister, 3) my most gracious Lady Margravine, Electress, and also out of my duty of Christian love, | have not failed to write this" letter of consolation to your sister. Well, my most gracious Lord King, | am sorry for such a burdensome concession to E. K. Mt. It is miserable enough, no one else can say 2c. But | pray that C.M. would earnestly consider God's will in this with patient faith, for the same kind God shows with such punishment that He has not forgotten C.M., nor does He want to, as it is written [Heb. 12:6]: "He prods all the children He accepts"; item [Revelation 3:19]: "Those | love | prod." And E. K. Mt. wanted to mean how much better she was before God than the majority of other kings and princes, whom God lets live unpunished in His wrath in blasphemy and all kinds of hopefulness and blindness, finally also dying in their sins and unbelief, as the rejected and naughty and unpunished children. But C.M., punished and humbled, is protected from such hope and sins, and is admonished to turn to God, so that, if it is to be valid for the wimps, C.M. should a thousand times rather desire to be such a chastened and punished king, than the most glorious king, who is unpunished, unpunished and condemned in sins. After all, this life is amoment, and [we] hope for another, and yet both, pious and wicked kings, must leave their crowns behind. The wicked kings, who die unpunished, cannot have such hope as E. K. Mt. certainly has, where she recognizes and accepts such ruths of God with patience and faith. For he cannot leave it alone, he must be a God of the afflicted, as he boasts everywhere, and his way is to overthrow the hopeful and to receive the miserable. Therefore, my most gracious Lord King, place such a case in the home of the gracious, fatherly will of God, which humiliates K. Mt. in time, on earth, so that he may

To the honorable and prudent gentlemen, mayor and council of the city of Gdansk, my favorable gentlemen and good friends. 

Grace and peace in Christ. Respectable, careful, dear gentlemen! Although I, perhaps unknown to E. F. or without any special reputation, should abstain from writing to E. F., but because | asked for it so diligently as for a service owed to my neighbor: | do not know how to refuse it, therefore | ask that E. F. will favorably grant it to me. There is a poor woman here, Elfe Mulmans, Andreas Buhe, your town citizen's (called Hans Buhe) son, legitimate husband, with whom she has produced a_ legitimate daughter, called Magdalena 2c.She has learned that the said Hans Bohe has died, and that his property has been transferred to her daughter Magdalena, and because the latter has also died in God, such property should fall to this Else as her rightful mother; she has therefore asked me to write to the F. H. and ask that the F. H. help her to obtain such property and that it be given to her. 

Now there is no doubt in my mind that E. F., as the sensible and right-loving, will know how to keep all due respect in this. But besides this, if it may help a little, my humble request is that Mrs. F. be all the more inclined to good women's things, since she is truly poor and needy, and from now on comes closer to old age every day, and can hardly support herself in such dwindling time, and even though there is much and much dear poverty among us, and yet from all countries it comes with even greater poverty, God knows that and it is true! Therefore, the Fathers will not only provide help, but also alms, where they can help the poor women to the goods that are pleasing to God. To the same E. F. together with your whole town, salvation and welfare be ordered, amen. At Wittemberg on: Friday after St. Luciae. s13. Dec.) 1532.

The Wittenberg theologians (Luther, Bugenhagen, Jonas and Melanchthon) to the council of Bremen, 


along with concerns about the restoration of the 

ceremonies in the cathedral there.

We give this document, which is written in Low German dialect, in a High German translation. 


To the honorable and wise mayors and councilmen of the city of Bremen, our favorable lords. 


God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. Honorable, wise, favorable lords! We bring to your knowledge that the noble and highborn prince and lord, Duke John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, our most gracious lord, has ordered us to write you a vain reply concerning the restitution of the ceremonies of the cathedral chapter in your city. 1) To this we have given our objection. 


1) On Palm Sunday 1532, a mob led by John Dore abolished the mass in the only Catholic church in Bremen, the cathedral. The city council feared that the city, which had already been sued by the emperor, would fall into the imperial power, and negotiated with the cathedral chapter. Other deprived rights were returned to it, but the demanded restitution of the Roman cult was rejected for the time being. As a member of the Schmalkaldic League, the council sought the opinions of its leaders. In addition to this concern, other opinions were received from the Hessian theologians and from Urban Rhegius in Celle. 


puts. However, since the matter is very important, we have considered it necessary for many reasons to see and send our advice and opinions to our most gracious lord, the Elector, beforehand, and we do not doubt that his electoral grace will send you its concerns and advice by other messages of its own, since we did not want to delay your messenger 2) any longer. And | Joannes Pomeranus have written further about it to your prelates, who will undoubtedly give you a good report, and we are willing to serve you to the best of our ability at all times. May God grant you His grace and peace in Christ. Date Wittenberg, the Thursday after Cinrum [27 Feb], Anno Domini 1533. 

(Now follows the theologians’ advice and concerns on the question of the council about the ceremonies in the cathedral church in Bremen). 

Although it is certain that the ordinary masses and ceremonies held in the monasteries are unlawful services, and no one should approve of them, nevertheless every authority should not command further than its subjects. Since a council of Bremen is not an authority over the cathedral chapter in the city of Bremen, the council cannot forbid the chapter to hold their ceremonies, but the city has the right, by deed and by force, to prevent the ceremonies in places where the council has no command. But if it should be said that a council hereby permits unrighteous worship, if the council does not wish to prohibit the same, the answer is that it has not permitted such, for a council cannot command or prohibit in places where a council has no commandment, just as we do not permit our neighbors in other lands and dominions to hold their unchristian ceremonies, and yet we cannot prohibit them from doing so. However, since it is to be feared that such a restitution of the ungodly ceremonies in your city might cause an uproar among the citizens and give rise to insurrection, a respectable council should nevertheless appeal to the Ca. 


2) The messenger who carried this letter was robbed and slain by a lansquenet two miles from Bremen; however, he had to atone for his deed on the Rade (near Walle).

2) Lautensack, born in Bamberg in 1478, was a painter and, in the early 1920s, organist and caretaker of the upper parish church in Bamberg. After the Peasants' War he had to leave Bamberg and went to Nuremberg. As early as 1530 he was suspected of Zwinglianism, but when called before the council he declared that he was being wronged and that he had no doubt about the words of Christ. Later he surrendered completely to mysticism and Schwenkfeldianism and was therefore expelled from the city in 1542; however, he sneaked back in and died there in August 1558.

Supplicatio ad Rusticum [Georg] ex Bohemia natum, cum 60 cives ejicere ex N. [Lipsia am Rande] vellet anno 1533. subjiundinas paschales. Dictata et a me [Veit Dietrich] excepta. 5. Aprilis 1533. 

Sublime, highborn prince and lord! We, E. F. G. loyal subjects of Leipzig, have heard a serious mandate from an honorable council of Leipzig, how we are to keep to the next Easter according to old traditional Christian custom with confessions and to receive the Holy Sacrament under one form 2c. Now we humbly ask E. F. G. to know that we have hitherto been gladly subject to E. F. G. with all our heart and with all our loyalty and also want to be so from now on, not only in temporal or worldly order, but also in everything that we may do with God and a good conscience; we are also ready, especially with fasting, confession, celebrations, and everything that the traditional custom of the Christian churches may comprehend, to gladly want to keep and follow; but most humbly ask E. F. G. to be a mild and merciful God. F. G. as a mild prince and gracious lord, to show mercy and space to our conscience in one piece. For we neither can nor want to do any hindrance or damage to the secular government nor to our own conscience, and E. F. G. wants to consider that we are the most merciful prince and gracious lord. F. G. will consider, because we have hitherto shown ourselves faithful to neither disobedience nor rebellion, but to all submissiveness with body and goods, as an honorable council at Leipzig itself testifies, E. F. G. out of princely, mild virtue, wanted to allow and grant us loyal subjects a few things that we no longer desire, for which the highest need, namely our conscience, compels and urges us, such as that we fast, confess, and keep everything that is pleasing to E. F. G., but are not urged to receive one form of the sacrament. F. F. G. sits in the supremacy of God and leads God's name as a prince and lord in the land. But because F. F. G. himself must pray the Lord's Prayer and ask God for forgiveness of sins, and not only for the sake of one sin alone or for the sake of undone sins, but also for all sins, present and future, we ask that F. F. G. may also forgive and graciously bear this one piece, because we are not able to change it through our imprisoned conscience, just as F. F. G. has done. 


himself desires forgiveness of sins, both of which have happened and will happen in the future. For we all live in sins and remain sinners, and are entitled to forgiveness and forgiveness, both from God and among ourselves. And what good would it do the F. F. G. if we were otherwise found blameless and obedient in all matters against the F. F. G., also willing and submissive, to surrender both body and goods, and should we not be able to obtain something from our gracious sovereign, which is most important to our conscience? Must a father suffer if his child breaks a leg and remains lame, or puts out an eye and goes blind, or otherwise suffers damage to his body: should the father therefore turn away his fatherly heart and cast away his child? That would be an unnatural and horrible thing, if the poor child had gotten such an infirmity by chance, not out of disobedience or will to be brave, but for some other reason. How much more can the F. F. G. consider that it is sharp enough, if the F. F. G. would turn their gracious princely heart away from us faithful, humble, obedient subjects and disown us for the sake of a few things, which we do neither willfully nor disobediently, but are urged to do by our conscience: We still ask, as before, most humbly, that E. F. G. would keep and show a gracious, fatherly heart towards us, E. F. G. poor faithful subjects, and graciously show us favor and grace in the insurmountable matter of our conscience, and yet graciously overlook and spare in it the one piece, so that we are (be) most humbly obedient in all others and want to be. We want to be found willing to earn this in addition to and with all our assets of body and goods, and to be willing to diligently owe our poor prayer to God. Request of E. F. G. for a fatherly answer.

Grace and peace. Venerable fathers! It is in the letter to the nine men 1) the sentence: "Time itself will find counsel", which they take bitingly, and set aside the remaining part of the letter, not considering that this was put in such a way in order to calm the unrest, and twist it as if Luther wanted badly that our house, which through the grace of God is already reformed to the gospel of Christ, should be extinct with us, without? 2) a succession by accepting those who want to let their virgin, who is capable of abstinence through the gift of God, 3) remain according to the counsel of Christ and Paul (Matth. 19,12. 1 Cor. 7, 37Z, and join us so that they can be raised under Christian freedom in the discipline of God.

As an answer, however, Luther is to use the fact that he and his brother, Duke Heinrich, had agreed and promised at the imperial congresses in Nuremberg and Augsburg to let the old, laudable and Christian religion remain until a common concilium. He had no doubt that Luther would help to promote this if possible.

1) by asking, among other things, about the passage in your letter: "Time itself will find counsel," which, if | am not mistaken, is set in such a way to calm the unrest. They stubbornly seize this passage, do not care about the rest of the letter, and twist it as if Luther badly wanted our house, which by the grace of God is| already reformed to the gospel of Christ, to die out with us without any succession by accepting those who, according to the counsel of Paul, want to let their virgin remain so [1 Cor. 7:37], and join us to be instructed in the discipline of God under Christian freedom. Melanchthon answered on your behalf with these words: 2) "Luther himself does not want abstinence to be forbidden to all. But he does not want to burden your comrades with vows or marriage covenants 3) on otherwise bind them in such a way that they could not comfortably leave this way of life." We accept this answer with gratitude, since it corresponds perfectly to our rule (instituto), where 4) with good forethought the same is denied with these words: "But we will not accept a vow from anyone, even if he should fervently ask for it." And if Luther, as the letter testifies and Philip) promises, had not reserved himself, because he was busy at the time, to answer us at another time, 5) we would already have been given an ample answer, when we consider the secret of monasticism from the old leaven, with which you have to deal. Now it is the endeavor of our mockers, not to say their silliness (ah, | speak as one who has experienced their quite miserable machinations quite often), that if we do not present the promised answer of Luther, perhaps by insisting on it, they will do their mockery with us| Therefore | would like to have asked you for the sake} of Christ, for whom all this. Our will is to argue to the best of our ability and knowledge according to the guideline of faith, that you may not find yourself burdened to put an end to the matter with a few words.

Wilskamp says thanks for the kindness shown him by the explanation, repeats in essence what he had already written on October 10, that it would have been enough for them in Melanchthon's answer, if Luther had not reserved himself to answer them himself. Mainly in order to train preachers of the Gospel, who are also beginning to be lacking there, they want their way of life to be a permanent one.

To the men to be highly honored in Christ, 


M. Luther and Ph. Melanchthon Wittenberg. 


Grace through Christ ! Since this messenger 6) is sent to you, most esteemed fathers in Christ, | could not help but write to you, even if only a little, at the same time giving thanks for the benefits and asking you to give us credit that we have so often burdened you, who are busy with more important things. If Luther himself (as Philip's letter testifies) had not reserved the right to answer us, we would already have been sufficiently answered to this piece: "Time itself will find counsel" against our pressing enemies by this modest saying of Philip: "Luther does not want abstinence to be forbidden to all, but neither does he want to burden your comrades with vows or marriage covenants 7) or otherwise bind them in such a way that they cannot comfortably leave this way of life." We seek nothing else than that our lives (according to the original institution of our fathers) be Christian free.

2) Luther was visiting Prince Joachim of Anhalt. 

3) Albrecht of Mainz, who believed he had found support in th so-called Hallian Alliance of Nov. 24, 1533, acted with all severit against the Protestants in Halle. When the Protestant-minde councilors elected in the spring of 1534 refused to communicat in the old manner at Easter, they were ordered to leave the cit after selling their possessions. Around Pentecost, they, seventee in number, had to wander "into misery". The majority went t Anhalt, to Kéchen, and during Luther's visit to Dessau, the presented their request for use to the Elector. The latter indee pleaded with Albrecht on their behalf. However, since he did no achieve anything with this, he described the proceedings agains: the people as an encroachment on the banning rights to which h was entitled as Burgrave, which led to protracted negotiations.

5) Heydeck, lord of Johannisburg, was the patron of the Schwenkfeldians. Speratus and also Apel feared that he would draw the duke over to them. Schubart later professed the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper, as a letter from him dated 1542 in the state archives testifies.

Speratus judges that Krautwald is the author of the work. He tells them what rumors are being spread about them, namely that no one can judge less than Philip, no one has such a weak mind as Martinus, and Jonas is in error as a simple-minded man. For the sake of the prince, for whom he fears, he asks for an answer about the work. - He sends several pieces of booty that someone who served in the army against the Turks gave him as a gift.

Wilskamp complains that since the time of the revival of the gospel, much evil has befallen the brothers, both from the papists and from so-called evangelicals. Now the council demands from them that they should lead the school, which is in a state of collapse. They have offered, with the permission of the abbess, who has the right to occupy the school, to bring in brothers from elsewhere who are experienced in the establishment and management of schools, since they lack the persons to take on this burden, or otherwise to help them for their share in the school system. But they did not want to allow them to draw help from elsewhere, nor did they want them to contribute only according to their share, nor did they want them to accept without a vow of abstinence, according to Christian freedom, those who wished to join them, and always referred to the words in Luther's letters: "Time itself will find counsel.

The city could serve in the word of God, since unfortunately not even one citizen devotes himself to the study of theology. The task of teaching school is hindered by the fact that they are already a laughing stock to the boys because of their monkish dress, and that they are ignorant of both Hebrew and Greek. In addition, there were people who thought that the brothers had to teach the children for the sake of their souls, and they referred to the writings of Luther, in which he expressed the wish that the monasteries should be transformed into schools. He asks Luther to give an answer in writing. He also hopes to receive now, as promised in Philip's letter, the long-awaited answer from Luther on how to understand the sentence: "Time itself will find counsel. With this word, certain people had tormented them quite impudently, and had waited for nothing else than to exterminate them, the brothers, and to seize their goods, because in the streets people were talking about having to do with the brothers because of the goods.

No. 1955 and No. 2000; in both places wrong names, namely "Daum" and "Dame" instead of: "Dame"). The Elector gave them an outlying estate of the Buch monastery, Wendishayn, for three years. The conditions there were unfavorable for them. The pastor there, only outwardly a friend of the Gospel, was a commissioner of the bishop.

Response to No. 2094d. - The Landgrave expresses his satisfaction that Luther has a good inclination toward Christian unity, so that God's honor and His Word are promoted. He hopes that God will grant ways and means by which unanimous Christian faith will be preserved. He reports that Melanchthon and Bucer have arrived there, and expresses the hope that Luther and others will behave toward each other in such a way that unanimity will be maintained, and God's Word will not remain in Saxony alone, but will resound everywhere and gain continuity.

Luther informs him that Wicel has written a new book for his papists. He asks him to report to the Count of Mansfeld that the two students are being cared for too lavishly; he should keep an eye on it. 

The original is in Rome in the Vatican. Facsimile and print in Georg G. Evers, M. Luther, 1. 1883, as supplement, and in Erl. Briefw., vol. X, p. 137. - The Erl. Briefw. says: "We give the text according to Evers, who, however, does not seem to have read without errors; as far as the not particularly successful facsimile allows, the errors are improved." Nevertheless, D. Enders has put no less than thirteen question marks to the readings in Evers and in the facsimile. To us, the letter, at least in its present form, seems somewhat suspicious.

Now, [since] the king also has the courage to accept the Gospel and to enter into our alliance with the princes and to let our Apologia 3) go in his kingdom, it seems to me that if His Majesty would be taken honestly, it should mislead the papists both with Concilio and everything else. For since all this, unsought by us, is self-sufficient, God may well intend something better and greater than we understand. And where he wants to greet us graciously, we must see to it that we do not let him pass by without thanks, Fronte capillata, post est occasio calva. *) Qui negligit occasionem (says Bonaventura), hunc rursus negliget occasio [He who misses the opportunity, the opportunity will miss again]. 

For the sake of the royal marriage, there is already the suspensio that the other legate is to deal with us theologians in the future, which cannot be denied him. That is none of the princes’ business. And | would like to hear for myself what reason they have for wanting to be so sure of the matter.

2) For the implementation of the Reformation in Luneburg, which took place under heavy fights between the Catholic council and the Protestant citizenry as well as Duke Ernst of Bratinschweig-Lineburg, Rhegius had already come from Celle to Lineburg in the summer of 1531 and repeatedly from Easter 1532 to autumn 1533, the second time as superintendent. After his departure, Heinrich Radbrock, the former abbot of the Scharnebeck monastery, who had already been his successor after Rhegius' first departure, now became his successor again, but was little equal to the position. Cruciger's appointment came to nothing, and negotiations with Hermann Bonnus in Libeck were equally futile. Only in 1537, when the council sent its own deputation to Schmalkalden to see Luther, it succeeded in winning Paulus von Rhode from Stettin, even if only for a short time. (Erl. Briefw.)

Our greeting. Venerable and reverend, dear devotee! We have read your letter, which you have now sent to us at the request of Antoni Schenitz concerning the vidimirung of several letters, which have been attributed to his brother by the Archbishop of Mainz 2c. Since the said Schenitz asks to order our court to vidimir such letters to his and his brother's children [Ehren Nothdurft] 2), we have all kinds of reservations about this, and also take care that the court concerned would hardly be able to do the same. Because we consider it to be the case that he would perhaps have a printout publicly issued for the honor of his and his brother's heirs, it should be sufficient, and also have more prestige, where such letters are exemplified by an open notary public, as is appropriate and due, and such letters are advertised.

The preachers at Frankfurt a. M. to Luther. (Regest.) 


They inform Luther that after preaching the gospel for eleven years, the city council has finally decided to prohibit the mass. The Bishop of Mainz and the Imperial Chamber Court are agitated by this, raging and raging and threatening the city with extreme evil if the mass is not restored. The council seems to be wavering. Therefore, they ask Luther to advise them on what they should do in this matter.

No. 2184a (Frankfurt a. M.)October 27, 1535. The Council of Frankfurt a. M. to Luther and Melanchthon. 


The council explains in detail how they were urged by the preachers to suspend the papal mass and ceremonies in the Catholic monasteries, and in what difficulty they got into as a result. Now they ask for advice on how they should behave. 


The original concept is in the Frankfurt City Archives, MG. C. 11 (12). lit. L. Printed in Erl. Briefw., vol. X, p. 251. 


To the worthy, highly learned gentlemen, Martins 


Luther, Doctor 2c., and Herr Philippen Melanchthon, our dear lords and special good friends. 


Our kind services before. Worthy, learned, dear gentlemen and especially good friends! Because of the suspended papal masses and ceremonies, we are confronted with errors and difficulties, which we have undertaken to discover to you out of good faith and to take care of with your faithful advice and report, with the friendly request that you will hear them willingly and without annoyance. For since the matter itself is of great importance and much is at stake, the necessity of telling the story at length requires it. Namely: 

When we, in recent years, shortly after the Bavarian outrage, appointed several preachers and commanded them to preach the Word of God for the salvation of us and our souls, our preachers have now, for several years, taken the mass and other papal church offices and ceremonies primarily in hand, against which they preach daily that they, especially the Mass, are not founded in Holy Scripture, are contrary to the Word of God, and are an abominable blasphemy, which we, as_ the magistrate, are obliged to abolish; From this the listening people not only against the mass, ceremonies and the (the) spiritual persons, but also against us, as those who were involved in such blasphemy 1) and who, as was our due, did not want to abolish it, received and apprehended such displeasure, from which we were concerned that all kinds of improprieties and wanton acts, in awakening evil, would follow in the future, as has also subsequently been shown. For when they began with the daily preaching and shouting against the mass and ceremonies for and for the longer the more violently 





1) consented. 


In a short time, it has come about that not only the common people, but also a part of us, the council, have been persuaded and have neither known nor believed otherwise than that it is in our power, and we would be guilty before God, to do away with the mass and ceremonies. This has also often been publicly communicated to us by them from the pulpit and in many other ways. For this reason we have been moved to send for them, and to tell them: It has now been a good while since they preached masses and ceremonies, as mentioned above, and although it may well be that the masses and ceremonies, as they have been in use among the clergy, do not have much basis in holy scripture, we know neither from their sermons nor otherwise to report that it is in our power, and that we are the same magistrate, to whom it is due and should be imposed, to create and rule with the ceremonies and the mass in such a way; with a friendly request that they would refrain from moving the unintelligent people to be ruthless against the clergy and us, and that they would preach the word of God, with humble denunciation of the abuses, for the increase of God's honor and love of neighbor, in such a way that thereby no one would give offense, and the Gospel would remain undefiled by those who had not yet come to know it. 

However, our admonitions and requests, which have been made to them several times, have had little effect on them, but they have persisted in their intentions to stop the masses and ceremonies, until things (which we do not like to write about them) have brought them to the point that not only the clergy, but also we against the common people, and one citizen against another, are in trouble, but also we against the common people, and one citizen against the other in worries, so that we were caused to request our community from guilds to guilds, and to let them do notices, admonition and reminder, as can be seen from the printed note, marked with the letter, 2) Hiebei verwahret. 

To which admonition and reminder our congregation obediently and well kept, and namely gave the answer: although they would like to suffer that the mass, for causes that 


2) On December 22, 1532, the City Council sent a printed patent to the guilds, stating that 1) each one should remember the oath he swore to Imperial Maj. Maj. and the Council, 2) to take into account the imperial conventions of Augsburg and Regensburg, and therefore 3) to leave the demand for the abolition of the mass 2c. in patience until the future Concilium. (Erl. Briefw.) 


3508 


If the above was not preached, they still wanted to have it returned to us, as the authorities. At the same time, we assume that it would have remained so if our prelates had been somewhat more inclined to peace. 

But they did not only not let them put up with such modesty of the congregation, but worked much more than before with preaching and otherwise, so that the previous indignation, awakened again, increased to such an extent that at last it was to be feared (as they, the preachers, 1) were partly allowed to hear [make] from the pulpit and to consternate [bedr6éwen]): where we, the council, would not hold mass, that the women and children would do so; so that it (to write the truth) should not be considered almost unequal to the beginning of an uprising and rebellion, as can be seen from the courage exercised by some children and other young people during the Christmas holidays of the same year, 2) and from the response that we received from the congregation to the other admonition, according to the note marked B, 3). For even though our congregation had completely returned the matter to us in the first reply, they had been so turned away and incited by the preachers and others who had a desire for unrest, 4) in the meantime, that in the last reply they unanimously wanted to have the mass dismissed. 

Now we have seen and noted that there is nothing else to be expected, except either outrage and intervention of the mob, which we would not have been responsible to allow in any way, or else the ceremonies would be done out of sight: we have, in order to prevent such mischief, with the [papal] clergy at our place, first of all in kindness 


1) Especially Dionysins Melander, the evangelical preacher in St. Bartholomew's Church. 

2) "On St. Stephen's Day and the following day (2nd and 3rd Christmas Day), many boys stayed in the parish (parish church of St. Bartholomew) after the (Protestant) sermon, and there prevented all services of the Catholics; the same also happened to the preachers (Dominican church) and the White Women or women firemen" (Ritter, evang. Denkw., p. 166). Several altars were also broken in the process. 

3) At the beginning of January 1533, the City Council again issued a printed patent to the guilds, in which it referred to the mischief that had taken place and at the same time drew attention to the imminent danger, since the city had already been threatened by Imperial Maj. Maj. had already threatened the city with a fine of 200 marks of soluble gold if it prevented the papal clergy from performing their ceremonies; at the same time, he called upon them to declare clearly whether the mass should be abolished or not, so that unanimous action could be taken according to necessity. (Ritter I. c. p. 167.)

5) for their own good, and so that we may live with them, they with us, and the common citizenry with each other in peace, suspend their masses and ceremonies for a time, namely until a future council or other Christian renewal, namely until a future council or other Christian renewal of religious matters, with a preliminary protestation that we do not want to have talked and acted with them in any other way than for the above-mentioned reasons, to maintain peace and unity, and that we do not know how to secure or defend them from violence in any other way. 6) 

Since the priests, after such an act with them, omit the mass and ceremonies, we and our congregation are, as we have worried before, from this time on complained to the Imperial Court of Appeal. There, irrespective of all our exceptions and pleas, we have been sued and proceeded against to such an extent 7) that we have been fined two hundred marks in commemorated gold, and in addition have been sentenced to the imperial guardianship. Eight, where our most gracious Lord Count Palatine Ludwig, Elector, by imperial order, 8) has decided upon our punishment. Maj.'s order, 8) on our appeal to his electorate, has not undertaken to bring matters to an amicable settlement between Mainz and us, as you know. In which amicable action, however, the matters may not have been settled, but both parties have been given an agreement to sign or sign off in a certain time, notwithstanding this opinion that provost, dean, chapter and common clergy in the monastery of St. Bartolme, founded with us (in view of the fact that there is a special imperial endowment above other monasteries, which is to be used by the monastery of St. Bartolme). Foundation before other monasteries, the election of a Roman king and temporal ruling head in Christendom at any time is decreed and confirmed in the Golden Bull), should be allowed and not refused nor prevented to preach, sing mass and read other things according to their statutes, foundation and church regulations, as by ancient custom; and we in 


5) Erl. Briefw.: "stood". 

6) This negotiation of the council with the Catholic clergy took place on January 4 and 5, 1533. 

7) On April 10, the Imperial Chamber Court at Speier sent the Council a Mandatum poenale, against which the Council protested and appealed to the Emperor. 

8) By order of King Ferdinand, Prince Ludwig of the Palatinate had taken over the amicable mediation between Frankfurt and Mainz and scheduled a day for this on April 25, which was then postponed to May 10.

We have been preaching the Gospel and the Word of |We are tolerated by the Protestant doctrine, and it is 


God to other churches outside of St. Bartholomew's, according to right understanding, peace and unity, as we can answer for this to God and the Roman Emperor. Maj. can answer for, we would like to have preached 2c. And that otherwise all other misunderstandings concerning the monasteries, convents and clergy in our city, until a future Christian Concilio or the Roman Royal Majesty and the Holy See. Maj. and the Holy Roman Empire. Reichs gemeiner Stande meeting, or until the Roman Imperial Maj. Maj. will, as is hoped, soon come to the Holy Roman Empire, be based on and stand for further action and settlement as it has been up to now. And in the meantime, the attribution or transcription with the justification to the Imperial Chamber Court should be stopped. Chamber Court should be stopped 2c., as is then further reported in the mentioned farewell. 

However, since this departure was due to many reasons, especially the fact that, according to it, two different repugnant sermons and the administration of the sacraments would arise in our city, and a new unrest and disruption of peace and unity would result from it, we have postponed writing it in or out, in the hope that the matter will be brought before our most gracious and gracious lords, the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, as well as our special, dear and good friends, masters, mayors and councillors of the cities of Strasbourg, 1) Ulm and Nuremberg, whom we have asked to find counsel in other ways. 

However, to write recently about it, all the advice given, also our applied diligence and costs, to obtain some further standstill, have been irreplaceable, so that we furthermore do not know any responsible excuse of delay to write the farewell on or off, but must either accept the same farewell, or, if not, be certain of the declaration of the penal case and the eight. 

But now let us consider, if we were to be declared in penance and in custody (as reported), into what danger, mischief and ruin our city would be led, it would also follow that we would then be forced to the entire restitution, not only in St. Bartolmes, but in all other monasteries, churches and convents, and thus from the pure doctrine of the Gospel completely by force. 

But after we know that in more than one city, where the right doctrine of the Gospel is preached, the papal masses and ceremonies, especially in the founders, are celebrated with no harm (as 


1) Strasbourg advised the city of Frankfurt not to give in on the matter. 


credibly reported that our gracious lord, the Landgrave of Hesse, acted in the same way before this time between Minster and the bishop there by contract, 2) also you at Wittenberg and Marburg have advised the city of Bremen in the same case, 3) as was previously attributed to our council friend Justinian von Holtzhausen, which you well know to remember, and other things that were given to him by each of you in particular at that time:We have not known how to avoid it, although it is highly repugnant and burdensome to us to contact the Elector of Mainz or his elector. Gn. We have not been able to avoid this, even though it is highly repugnant to us, to have us take action with the Elector of Main or his lordly deputies for the restitution of the monastery of St. Bartolmes on the basis of the proposed Heidelberg means, but that there not the clergy, but we would have the prebendary, as long as the decency lasts. 

All of which we hold up to our preachers, talk to them kindly about it, and have them ask for it: Since we do not know any other way of dealing with the evil that is standing on the matter, that they, considering that such things, as mentioned above, are tolerated in more cities, and as we understood from both of you, according to your writings, to our Naths friend Justinian von Holtzhausen, 4) would like to be allowed in their sermons in good conscience, that we would like to be allowed in this case with a good conscience, and that we would like to keep their sermons all the more mild and modest, so that the common people would not be irritated or incited to sit down against our nobility and to show themselves contrary, from which further unrest and indignation would be to be feared. 

In which they have sent us all kinds of complaints (as can be heard in part from the writings that they subsequently handed over in our council), and that writings should have gone out from both of you, as you can see. 


2) in the treaty brokered by the landgrave, dated 14 Feb. 1533, between the city of Minster and the bishop, according to which the city on the one hand recognized the old constitution of the cathedral priest, and on the other hand was granted six churches for Protestant preaching. 

3) Justinian von Holzhausen, born 1502, a humanist student of Melanchthon (inscribed in Wittenberg on Dec. 19, 1524) and in correspondence with him, was elected to the City Council in 1529, belonged with his father, Hamman von Holzhausen, to the most respected members of the Protestant party in the City Council, represented the city as an envoy at several imperial congresses, as well as in 1537 at the Schmalkalden Convention, at which Frankfurt joined the League. He died on Sept. 9, 1553.

(if you had been rightly informed of the matter), do not want to give credence to it (which is also the main reason that we have to trouble you again with this), nor have they refrained from making the people stubborn and obstinate about this undertaking, so that we have to worry about tumult and outrage no less than before, that we would not have provided for them at all. 

However, at the end of their writing, they have offered to follow your and others' advice and instruction in this matter, which we have therefore accepted from them, and send you their letter, at their request, together with other things they write to you, together or separately, privately, unknowingly to us, as they have sent us all this in writing, enclosed. 

Dear Sirs and Friends! Now that you have recently and truthfully heard how we have come to the suspension, what has happened, what has followed from it, and what is to be done about it, you, as the most knowledgeable, can well judge that the issue is not whether one should trust in God (for no one doubts this), but whether we, the mayor and council of Frankfurt, have been obliged to cancel the masses and ceremonies in the churches, since we have no patronatus or other jurisdiction: whether we, the mayor and council of Frankfurt, are obliged to abolish the masses and ceremonies in the churches, since we have no zus patronatus or other jurisdiction, and are also obliged to let our city come to thorough ruin rather than to restore one convent again, regardless of the fact that by such restitution of the one convent the teaching of the Gospel is preserved in the other churches. 

So our friendly request to you is with special diligence: you shall, in response to our preachers’ letter and this true report of ours, in honor of the Gospel, give us your good advice, report and instruction as to how we may, according to the form of the matters of the restitution of half of the St. Bartelmes Monastery, without rebuke to our consciences. Bartelmes without reprimand and without burdening our consciences,1) likewise to admonish our preachers that they are obliged to abide by their orders "in honor of God" and for the sake of common peace. For what we know ourselves to do, or to refrain from doing, out of instruction of the Word off God, to which 


1) Luther's answer to this letter is not found, but the same folder] of the archives contains Melanchthon's answer from Jena dated November 5 (still unprinted), in which he advises to agree to the' restitution of the mass at St. Bartholomew's, because the city council there does not have the jus patronatus, and the refusal would not only bring the imperial power over the city, but could also give rise to a great war. (Erl. Briefw.) 





we would gladly comply, insofar as God grants us grace, with our part of the trust that our preachers shall, in accordance with their command, as they have lbeen instructed by you on the basis of the Scriptures, comply with all due diligence. And for our sake, show yourselves to be as benevolent as our trust in you is, land as necessity demands, according to the form and importance of the trade. The Almighty will graciously reward this, and we will earn it for you together and separately with friendly diligence and will. Date on Wednesday the 27th day of Octobris Anno 2c. xxxv.

Rothmann, whose sister he married in 1533; expelled by the Anabaptists in 1534 on January 1, he first went to Lippstadt, where he received a call to preach in Soest in March of the same year. As such, he signed the Schmalkaldic Articles in 1537 (St. Louis edition, vol.

It remained like this until the Interim on Oct. 4, 1548, when the church had to be completely vacated to the Catholics. (Erl. Briefw.)

Handwritten at Wolfenbittel, Cod. Helmst. 85.1.13. Printed in Erl. Briefw., vol. X, p. 336. 


Bucer reports that they (the Upper German theologians) received Luther's letter on May 16, because four of them were about to visit Erfurt. After receiving the letter (No. 2237), they immediately wrote to the others in Eisenach, who were waiting for Luther's instructions there, that they should follow them and go with them to Wittenberg, where they hoped to arrive on May 21. 

The codex adds the remark: This letter was immediately sent by D. Martinus Luther to Grimma to Philipp Melanchthon, who was expecting the theologians of the upper Germany in that place, and Luther had written with his own hand in Bucer's letters: 


Here you have M. Bucer's letter. | am surprised at the very great speed of the messenger. Therefore, return to us. You know the other thing.

2) Hartmann and Jager found a copy of this letter among Brenz's papers. Luther had enclosed it with a letter from Menius to Brenz, in which he reported on the Concordia negotiations. Brenz, who was in constant contact with Ansbach, was supposed to take care of him. Since Menius left Wittenberg on May 30 (Kolde, Analecta p. 229), it can be assumed, that our letter was written on May 29.
